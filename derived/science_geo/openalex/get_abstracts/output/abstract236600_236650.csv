https://openalex.org/W2163647009,"To what extent do we learn from the positive versus negative outcomes of our decisions? The neuromodulator dopamine plays a key role in these reinforcement learning processes. Patients with Parkinson's disease, who have depleted dopamine in the basal ganglia, are impaired in tasks that require learning from trial and error. Here, we show, using two cognitive procedural learning tasks, that Parkinson's patients off medication are better at learning to avoid choices that lead to negative outcomes than they are at learning from positive outcomes. Dopamine medication reverses this bias, making patients more sensitive to positive than negative outcomes. This pattern was predicted by our biologically based computational model of basal ganglia–dopamine interactions in cognition, which has separate pathways for “Go” and “NoGo” responses that are differentially modulated by positive and negative reinforcement."

This strain, imposed by coherent epitaxy, can result in a ferroelectric transition temperature nearly 500°C higher and a remanent polarization at least 250% higher than bulk BaTiO 3 single crystals. This work demonstrates a route to a lead-free ferroelectric for nonvolatile memories and electro-optic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2007941671,"Cation exchange has been investigated in a wide range of nanocrystals of varying composition, size, and shape. Complete and fully reversible exchange occurs, and the rates of the reactions are much faster than in bulk cation exchange processes. A critical size has been identified below which the shapes of complex nanocrystals evolve toward the equilibrium shape with lowest energy during the exchange reaction. Above the critical size, the anion sublattice remains intact and the basic shapes of the initial nanocrystals are retained throughout the cation exchange. The size-dependent shape change can also be used to infer features of the microscopic mechanism."

After escaping from endosomes into the cytoplasm, GAS became enveloped by autophagosome-like compartments and were killed upon fusion of these compartments with lysosomes. In autophagy-deficient Atg5 –/– cells, GAS survived, multiplied, and were released from the cells. Thus, the autophagic machinery can act as an innate defense system against invading pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2152418590,"The identity of nicotinic receptor subtypes sufficient to elicit both the acute and chronic effects of nicotine dependence is unknown. We engineered mutant mice with α4 nicotinic subunits containing a single point mutation, Leu 9′ → Ala 9′ in the pore-forming M2 domain, rendering α4* receptors hypersensitive to nicotine. Selective activation of α4* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with low doses of agonist recapitulates nicotine effects thought to be important in dependence, including reinforcement in response to acute nicotine administration, as well as tolerance and sensitization elicited by chronic nicotine administration. These data indicate that activation of α4* receptors is sufficient for nicotine-induced reward, tolerance, and sensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1994577866,"Phosphorylation of the human histone variant H2A.X and H2Av, its homolog in Drosophila melanogaster , occurs rapidly at sites of DNA double-strand breaks. Little is known about the function of this phosphorylation or its removal during DNA repair. Here, we demonstrate that the Drosophila Tip60 (dTip60) chromatin-remodeling complex acetylates nucleosomal phospho-H2Av and exchanges it with an unmodified H2Av. Both the histone acetyltransferase dTip60 as well as the adenosine triphosphatase Domino/p400 catalyze the exchange of phospho-H2Av. Thus, these data reveal a previously unknown mechanism for selective histone exchange that uses the concerted action of two distinct chromatin-remodeling enzymes within the same multiprotein complex."

The molecular cues carrying this information remain largely unknown. Here, we show that small peptides that serve as ligands for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules function also as sensory stimuli for a subset of vomeronasal sensory neurons located in the basal Gao- and V2R receptor–expressing zone of the vomeronasal epithelium. In behaving mice, the same peptides function as individuality signals underlying mate recognition in the context of pregnancy block. MHC peptides constitute a previously unknown family of chemosensory stimuli by which MHC genotypic diversity can influence social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2127189538,"The loss of biodiversity can have significant impacts on ecosystem functioning, but the mechanisms involved lack empirical confirmation. Using soil microcosms, we show experimentally that functional dissimilarity among detritivorous species, not species number, drives community compositional effects on leaf litter mass loss and soil respiration, two key soil ecosystem processes. These experiments confirm theoretical predictions that biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning can be predicted by the degree of functional differences among species."
https://openalex.org/W2090849645,"Most mutations in the dystrophin gene create a frameshift or a stop in the mRNA and are associated with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Exon skipping that naturally occurs at low frequency sometimes eliminates the mutation and leads to the production of a rescued protein. We have achieved persistent exon skipping that removes the mutated exon on the dystrophin messenger mRNA of the mdx mouse, by a single administration of an AAV vector expressing antisense sequences linked to a modified U7 small nuclear RNA. We report the sustained production of functional dystrophin at physiological levels in entire groups of muscles and the correction of the muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2076880379,"Coupled surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are shown to provide effective transfer of excitation energy from donor molecules to acceptor molecules on opposite sides of metal films up to 120 nanometers thick. This variant of radiative transfer should allow directional control over the flow of excitation energy with the use of suitably designed metallic nanostructures, with SPPs mediating transfer over length scales of 10(-7) to 10(-4) meters. In the emerging field of nanophotonics, such a prospect could allow subwavelength-scale manipulation of light and provide an interface to the outside world."
https://openalex.org/W1964320031,"Modulation of calcium-sensitive potassium (BK) channels by oxygen is important in several mammalian tissues, and in the carotid body it is crucial to respiratory control. However, the identity of the oxygen sensor remains unknown. We demonstrate that hemoxygenase-2 (HO-2) is part of the BK channel complex and enhances channel activity in normoxia. Knockdown of HO-2 expression reduced channel activity, and carbon monoxide, a product of HO-2 activity, rescued this loss of function. Inhibition of BK channels by hypoxia was dependent on HO-2 expression and was augmented by HO-2 stimulation. Furthermore, carotid body cells demonstrated HO-2–dependent hypoxic BK channel inhibition, which indicates that HO-2 is an oxygen sensor that controls channel activity during oxygen deprivation."

We report the 17-angstrom resolution structures of a central component of Salmonella typhimurium TTSS, the needle complex, and its assembly precursor, the bacterial envelope–anchored base. Both the base and the fully assembled needle complex adopted multiple oligomeric states in vivo, and needle assembly was accompanied by recruitment of the protein PrgJ as a structural component of the base. Moreover, conformational changes during needle assembly created scaffolds for anchoring both PrgJ and the needle substructure and may provide the basis for substrate-specificity switching during type III secretion."

https://openalex.org/W1994914565,"In RNA interference (RNAi), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers degradation of homologous messenger RNA. In many organisms, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is required to initiate or amplify RNAi, but the substrate for dsRNA synthesis in vivo is not known. Here, we show that RdRp-dependent transgene silencing in Arabidopsis was caused by mutation of XRN4, which is a ribonuclease (RNase) implicated in mRNA turnover by means of decapping and 5′-3′ exonucleolysis. When both XRN4 and the RdRp were mutated, the plants accumulated decapped transgene mRNA. We propose that mRNAs lacking a cap structure become exposed to RdRp to initiate or maintain RNAi."
https://openalex.org/W2019721726,"Dynamic instability—the switching of a two-state polymer between phases of steady elongation and rapid shortening—is essential to the cellular function of eukaryotic microtubules, especially during chromosome segregation. Since the discovery of dynamic instability 20 years ago, no other biological polymer has been found to exhibit this behavior. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we observe that the prokaryotic actin homolog ParM, whose assembly is required for the segregation of large, low–copy number plasmids, displays both dynamic instability and symmetrical, bidirectional polymerization. The dynamic instability of ParM is regulated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis, and filaments are stabilized by a cap of ATP-bound monomers. ParM is not related to tubulin, so its dynamic instability must have arisen by convergent evolution driven by a set of common constraints on polymer-based segregation of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2120597581,"One of the important roles of microRNA (miRNA) is to direct the cleavage of messenger RNA (mRNA). However, the mechanisms of decay of the cleaved mRNA products is not well understood. We show that miRNA-directed cleavage products in organisms as diverse as Arabidopsis , mouse, and Epstein-Barr virus have at their 3' ends a stretch (1 to 24 nucleotides) of oligouridine posttranscriptionally added downstream of the cleavage site. This 3' uridine addition, as shown for Arabidopsis , is correlated with decapping and 5' shortening of the cleaved products, suggesting a mechanistic step in the miRNA-directed mRNA decay mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2035186247,"Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) comprise a family of small ubiquitin-specific proteases of uncertain function. Although no cellular substrates have been identified for UCHs, their highly tissue-specific expression patterns and the association of UCH-L1 mutations with human disease strongly suggest a critical role. The structure of the yeast UCH Yuh1-ubiquitin aldehyde complex identified an active site crossover loop predicted to limit the size of suitable substrates. We report the 1.45 Å resolution crystal structure of human UCH-L3 in complex with the inhibitor ubiquitin vinylmethylester, an inhibitor that forms a covalent adduct with the active site cysteine of ubiquitin-specific proteases. This structure confirms the predicted mechanism of the inhibitor and allows the direct comparison of a UCH family enzyme in the free and ligand-bound state. We also show the efficient hydrolysis by human UCH-L3 of a 13-residue peptide in isopeptide linkage with ubiquitin, consistent with considerable flexibility in UCH substrate size. We propose a model for the catalytic cycle of UCH family members which accounts for the hydrolysis of larger ubiquitin conjugates.

A wide variety of cellular biochemical pathways are regulated by the post-translational addition of ubiquitin (Ub) 1The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; BP-Ub, branched peptide HA-ubiquitin; DTT, dithiothreitol; DUB, deubiquitinating enzyme; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; HA, hemagglutinin; HAUb, hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine; Ubal, ubiquitin aldehyde; Ubp, ubiquitin processing protease; UbVME, ubiquitin vinylmethylester; UCH, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase; USP, ubiquitin specific protease. to protein substrates (1Glickman M.H.

Although the enzymatic process of ubiquitin ligation has been studied extensively, that of ubiquitin deconjugation is less well understood. A group of enzymes collectively termed deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the isopeptide linkage that joins the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and a lysine side chain on the target polypeptide. The DUB family consists of four structurally distinct subfamilies: the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), ubiquitin-processing proteases (Ubps, USPs), OTU domain-containing enzymes (otubains) and the Jab/MPN domain-associated metalloisopeptidase domain-containing metalloproteases (3Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 4Wing S.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 590-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The first three enzyme classes all possess the sequence signature of cysteine proteases: a conserved catalytic triad of cysteine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues. Sequence analysis of the human genome predicts at least 100 DUBs, which begs the question of their physiological roles. Although restricted substrate specificity is predicted to underlie the requirement for such a large enzyme family, little is known about substrate specificity determinants. The recently published structures for the Ubp family member USP7 (HAUSP) in the unliganded and liganded state (5Hu M. Li P. Li M. Li W. Yao T. Wu J.W. Gu W. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) affords a unique opportunity to examine specificity determinants for this enzyme. Although the HAUSP catalytic residues are misaligned in the unliganded state, the catalytic core undergoes a dramatic conformational change when in a complex with the inhibitor ubiquitin aldehyde (Ubal), resulting in alignment of the catalytic residues with the C terminus of Ub. The open configuration of the HAUSP active site explains the ability of this class of enzyme to accommodate large ubiquitin conjugates as substrates (e.g. p53). In contrast, the UCH enzymes have an apparent preference for small C-terminal leaving groups, as typified by ubiquitin ethyl ester (6Larsen C.N. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3358-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the yeast enzyme Yuh1 in a complex with Ubal provided some insights into the substrate specificity of UCHs (7Johnston S.C. Riddle S.M. Cohen R.E. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3877-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A 20-residue loop was observed to cover the active site cleft and is thus inferred to impose a limit on the size of the Ub-conjugated substrate that Yuh1 can accommodate. However, this model does not explain the apparent ability of some UCHs to hydrolyze much larger substrates (8Roff M. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Jacque J.M. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hay R.T. J.

Biochem. 1999; 274: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting potential alternate conformations. This active site crossover loop could not be resolved in the crystal structure for unliganded human UCH-L3 (11Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), suggesting that this loop may have significant flexibility in the unliganded state. Although several ligand-induced conformational changes were inferred upon comparison of the structure for UCH-L3 with that of Yuh1·Ubal, the limited sequence identity between UCH-L3 and Yuh1 (30%) complicates a direct comparison. To explain the properties and substrate preference of UCHs we describe the 1.45 Å crystal structure of human UCH-L3 in a complex with the mechanism-based inhibitor ubiquitin vinylmethylester (UbVME). This structure allows the direct comparison of conformational changes that occur between the unliganded (11Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and Ub-bound states of UCH-L3. We also report the synthesis of a branched peptide substrate that consists of an N-terminally biotinylated 13-residue peptide, with its sequence centered on ubiquitin lysine 48, in isopeptide linkage with HA-tagged Ub (HAUb). Although the configuration of the active site crossover loop observed in our structure precludes the accommodation of such a large isopeptide-linked substrate, we show that UCH-L3 can nonetheless hydrolyze the isopeptide bond in this branched peptide. Taking into consideration both the observed structure and substrate specificity, we propose a model for UCH-mediated Ub conjugate hydrolysis. Protein Expression and Purification—UCH-L3 in pRSET vector was obtained from Dr. Keith Wilkinson. UCH-L3 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (12Larsen C.N. Price J.S. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6735-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of ubiquitin (Ub), synthesis and ligation of the glycine VME moiety to ubiquitin, and purification of the UbVME complex were performed as described previously (13Borodovsky A. Ovaa H. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. Kessler B.M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). To prepare the UCH-L3·UbVME complex, the pH of the UbVME solution (in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5) was adjusted to 7.5 by the addition of 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, then UCH-L3 (in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 3% glycerol) was added so that the final UCH-L3:UbVME molar ratio was 2:1 (2 ml of UbVME at 0.3 mg/ml, 1.9 ml of 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and 200 μl of UCH-L3 at 16 mg/ml). The mixture was incubated for 4-5 h at 4 °C, and the formation of the complex, which results in an 8-kDa shift in molecular mass of UCH-L3, was verified by SDS-PAGE. After dialysis, UCH-L3 and UCH-L3·UbVME were separated on a Mono Q column (1 ml, Amersham Biosciences), using a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol). Fractions containing the UCH-L3·UbVME complex were dialyzed against 10 mm NaMOPS, pH 6.8, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and concentrated to 17 mg/ml. Synthesis and Subsequent Deubiquitination of Branched Ub Peptides—1 μl of HAUb (0.1 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 μl of E1 (0.25 μm final concentration), 1 μl of E2-25K (2.5 μm final concentration), and 1 μl of buffer A (0.5 m Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm DTT, 20 mm ATP, and 25 mm MgCl2). Biotin-RLIFAGKQLEDGR (2 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution) was added to the above mixture, and the reaction was incubated for 15 h at 37 °C to make the branched peptide HA-ubiquitin (BP-Ub). The products of this reaction were characterized by Western blot with the reaction considered successful if blots confirmed the presence of a band of 10 kDa containing the HA and biotin epitopes. To perform the deubiquitination assay, 3 μl of buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 20 μm ZnCl2) and 1 μl of UCH-L3 (at 5 μg/ml, 20 nm final concentration) were added to the above mix (final volume of 10 μl), and samples were incubated at 37 °C. Samples were quenched at five different time points (5, 10, 20, 30, and 45 min) by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a Tris/Tricine peptide separation gel. The samples were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and biotinylated products were detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. The membrane was then stripped and probed with 12CA5 α-HA antibody to confirm the continued presence of the HAUb moiety. Crystallization and Data Collection—UCH-L3·UbVME crystals were grown by vapor diffusion at 4 °C from hanging drops containing 0.5 μl of protein solution (17 mg/ml in 10 mm NaMOPS, pH 6.8, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA) and 0.5 μl of precipitant solution (100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 23.5% PEG 4000, and 260 mm MgCl2). Rod-shaped crystals grew over 7-10 days. Crystals were soaked briefly in a cryoprotectant solution (100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 22% PEG 4000, 20% PEG 400, and 260 mm MgCl2) and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected to 1.45 Å with an ADSC Q315 charge-coupled device detector at beamline 8-BM at the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). The crystals belong to space group P1, with unit cell dimensions a = 46.11 Å, b = 49.29 Å, c = 67.62 Å, α = 86.12°, β = 75.03°, γ = 76.78°, with two UCH-L3·UbVME complexes/asymmetric unit.

The final model includes residues 2-230 and 4-230 for the first and second copies of UCH-L3, respectively, residues 1-75 of ubiquitin and the glycine VME ligand for both copies of the complex, and 1067 solvent molecules. Residues 1 (copy one) and 1-3 (copy two) of UCH-L3 were disordered. The side chains of Glu24 (copy two of ubiquitin), Glu158 (copy one of UCH-L3), and Lys136 (copy two of UCH-L3) were not modeled. Structural analysis used LIGPLOT, CONTACT, DYNDOM, and AREAIMOL (CCP4, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK) and LSQMAN (Uppsala Software Factory, Uppsala, Sweden). Except where noted, figures were generated with RIBBONS (17Carson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). UCH-L3·UbVME Complex and UCH-L3 Activity—UCH-L3 was expressed in E. coli, purified, and mixed in 2:1 molar ratio with UbVME at pH 7.5 to yield the UCH-L3·UbVME complex (see “Experimental Procedures”). Unreacted UCH-L3 was separated from the UCH-L3·UbVME complex by anion exchange chromatography. The elution profile shows two distinct peaks, corresponding to the liganded and free UCH-L3 (Fig. 1). A molecular mass shift of ∼8 kDa, consistent with covalent attachment of UbVME to UCH-L3, is evident when the samples are analyzed by SDS-PAGE. It has been postulated that the physiological role of UCHs may be the regeneration of active ubiquitin from small C-terminal adducts, such as Ub-glutathione adducts that occur through unregulated cellular reactions (6Larsen C.N. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3358-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 11Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P.

However, a potential isopeptidase activity of UCH-L3 has been difficult to demonstrate for lack of a viable method to produce Ub in isopeptide linkage to a non-Ub substrate other than free lysine. Indeed, UCH-L3 does hydrolyze a single lysine residue in isopeptide linkage to the C-terminal glycine 76 of ubiquitin (6Larsen C.N. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3358-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 10Layfield R. Franklin K. Landon M. Walker G. Wang P. Ramage R. Brown A. Love S. Urquhart K. Muir T. Baker R. Mayer R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) but fails to cleave a ubiquitin dimer in which the C terminus of one ubiquitin is linked via an isopeptide bond to lysine 48 of a second ubiquitin (6Larsen C.N. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3358-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To address the ability of UCH-L3 to cleave isopeptide-linked oligopeptide-Ub substrates, we enzymatically synthesized an N-terminally biotin-tagged 13-amino acid peptide corresponding to Ub residues Arg42-Arg54, with a lysine at position 7 representing Lys48 of Ub. In addition to providing an epitope tag for this peptide, the N-terminal biotin group ensures that the central lysine contains the only free amine atom in this peptide. The C-terminal glycine 76 of HAUb was then covalently attached to the ϵ-amine group of the peptide using purified E1 and E2 ubiquitin ligases to form a branched peptide-HAUb complex (see “Experimental Procedures”). The adduct carries both an HA epitope tag (Ub) and a biotin moiety (peptide) (Fig. 2A). We then tested the ability of UCH-L3 to hydrolyze the isopeptide bond of the BP-Ub conjugate. The substrate was incubated in the presence or absence of UCH-L3, and aliquots were removed at various time points. UCH-L3 inactivated by pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide served as a negative control (Fig. 2B). The samples were resolved by gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase to monitor the presence of biotinylated branched peptide. Fig. 2B shows that UCH-L3 rapidly hydrolyzes the BP-Ub isopeptide bond, as indicated by the loss of streptavidin reactivity. An anti-HA blot shows the continued presence of HAUb as expected. Although the preparation of BP-Ub in small scale prevents an accurate determination of substrate concentration and subsequently catalytic efficiency, we estimate a substrate:enzyme ratio of at least 5:1. Because we observe more than 90% substrate conversion in 5 min, we conclude that BP-Ub is a suitable substrate for UCH-L3. Efforts for preparation and purification of BP-Ub on a preparative scale, to allow accurate kinetic measurements, are currently ongoing. Structure Determination—The UCH-L3·UbVME complex was crystallized, and its structure was determined to 1.45 Å resolution (see “Experimental Procedures”). Table I shows data collection, processing, and refinement statistics. The UCH-L3·UbVME model includes all ubiquitin and UCH-L3 residues except for the UCH-L3 first residue, for which no electron density was observed. The UCH-L3 structure consists of a six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet surrounded by eight α-helices, including an additional helix and loop that were disordered in the unliganded UCH-L3 structure (11Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We refer to this helix as H6′ because it immediately follows the previously named H6 helix (Fig. 3). It is also notable that residues Ile154, His158, and Ala154 form a conserved hydrophobic face on helix H6, anchoring the helix to the rest of the protein. These residues are conserved among all human UCHs: UCH-L1, UCH-L3, UCH37, and BAP1, but not Yuh1, which lacks an α-helix in this region. There are two UCH-L3·UbVME complexes per asymmetric unit. These two complexes are nearly identical with a root mean square deviation of 0.350 Å on Cα atoms for UCH-L3 and 0.354 Å for UbVME. However, by superimposing the UCH-L3 structures we observe a rigid body rotation of UbVME between the two complexes (Fig. 4). This movement encompasses a 10° rotation that hinges around residues 73 and 9 of ubiquitin, leaving the C-terminal Ub residues 73-76 and loop residues 8-9 unchanged. Although this rotational motion of ubiquitin is likely a crystallographic artifact resulting from crystal packing interactions, it highlights that the C terminus and the first N-terminal loop of the ubiquitin comprise the major interactions with UCH-L3 (see below). In contrast, the interactions of Gly47 and His68 of UbVME with Leu41 and Met44 located at the H2 helix of UCH-L3, which are present only in one UCH-L3·UbVME complex, are likely minor determinants of UCH-L3·UbVME specificity because they can be disrupted by the generally weak crystal packing force without disassembling the UCH-L3·UbVME complex. UbVME Targets the Active Site Cysteine of UCH-L3—Ubiquitin derivatives with C-terminal electrophilic traps are specific inhibitors of DUBs, including UCH-L3 (13Borodovsky A. Ovaa H. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. Kessler B.M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 19Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Casagrande R. Overkleeft H.S. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Despite the specificity of these inhibitors, a precise mode of inhibition has not been determined conclusively, for example, through isolation of an inhibitor-modified, active site-derived peptide. It has been argued that inhibition of DUBs by these ubiquitin derivatives may occur through covalent modification of the active site cysteine or possibly through nonspecific alkylation of the active site histidine residue. The 1.45 Å crystal structure of UCH-L3·UbVME reported here allows the unambiguous identification of the residue modified by this inhibitor. UCH-L3 reacts with UbVME in a 1,4-Michael addition to yield a thioether bond. Inspection of the electron density in the UCH-L3 active site indicates formation of a covalent bond between the side chain sulfur atom of cysteine 95 and the former vinyl group of the inhibitor (Fig. 5) as expected. The location of the intermolecular thioether bond corresponds to the carbonyl carbon of the ubiquitin glycine 76, which is the natural cleavage site of ubiquitin from substrates of DUBs. The density distribution corresponding to the methylester portion of inhibitor suggests alternate conformations for this moiety, implying free rotation of the methylester group (Fig. 5B). Specific Interactions between UCH-L3 and UbVME—Although there are many interacting residues in the UCH-L3·UbVME complex (Fig. 3), a subset of residues plays an important role in the proper positioning of ubiquitin in the active site of UCH-L3. The C terminus of ubiquitin is involved in extensive interactions along the active site cleft of UCH-L3. Most notably, Arg74 of ubiquitin forms an extensive hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction network with 11 UCH-L3 residues. For instance, Arg74 interacts with several backbone carbonyl oxygens at the C terminus of helix H6′, effectively capping helix H6′. This set of capping interactions may stabilize the previously unstructured active site crossover loop over the C terminus of ubiquitin. Asp33, an acidic residue conserved among all UCH family of proteins, forms a salt bridge with Arg72 of ubiquitin. Additional UCH family conserved residues interact with the C-terminal residues of ubiquitin (Glu10, Pro13, Leu55, and Phe170) and the VME moiety (Gln89, Asn93, His169, and Arg186). Finally, the first N-terminal loop of ubiquitin wedges itself between helix H2 and the loop between Ser5 and His7 of UCH-L3, resulting in an interaction of Leu8 and Thr9 of ubiquitin with Val34, Met37, Met213, and residues 220-224 of UCH-L3. Ubiquitin-induced Conformational Changes in UCH-L3— The structure of unliganded human UCH-L3 has been reported previously (11Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The high resolution structure of the UCH-L3·UbVME complex detailed here allows the description of the conformational changes observed when UCH-L3 interacts with Ub. Overall, our structure of UCH-L3 in complex with UbVME is similar to that of free UCH-L3 (root mean square deviation = 1.18 Å over 206 Cα atoms present in both structures; 0.42 Å over 174 Cα atoms when regions of apparent conformational change are omitted from analysis). When superimposed, unliganded UCH-L3 and UbVME-liganded UCH-L3 display significant conformational differences in regions adjacent to the active site (Fig. 6). The largest structural change is the stabilization of a large, previously unstructured loop of UCH-L3 (residues 146-167) into a helix (H6′; 142-154) followed by an S-shaped loop (155-167) that crosses over the active site of the enzyme. Residues 142-146 switch from an extended conformation in the unliganded structure to form the first turn of the H6′ helix in the UCH-L3·UbVME complex. The N-terminal 12 residues of UCH-L3 also undergo a drastic conformational change, forming an elongated strand that opens the active site cleft for docking of the C terminus of ubiquitin and avoids steric clash with the newly structured helix H6′. This N-terminal elongated strand forms parallel β-sheet hydrogen bonds with the C terminus of Ub. We also observe an ∼2 Å shift of helix H2 and its flanking loop (residues 34-44) as well as the loop preceding helix H4 (residues 89-94) in UCH-L3 to accommodate docking of ubiquitin. With the exception of the S-shaped loop, all of these changes are necessary to render the active site of UCH-L3 accessible to its ubiquitin conjugate substrates. The corresponding regions of Yuh1 have similar conformations in the Yuh1·Ubal complex (7Johnston S.C. Riddle S.M. Cohen R.E. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3877-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Based on the homology of Yuh1 with UCH-L3 it was proposed that UCH-L3 would use a similar mechanism. That suggestion is now confirmed experimentally and suggests a conserved substrate docking mechanism among the UCH family members. Importantly, the conformation of the crossover loop is remarkably similar for UCH-L3 and Yuh1, especially considering the poor sequence conservation between them in that region (Fig. 3). Although the UCHs are among the best characterized DUBs, their precise catalytic role in Ub biochemistry has yet to be explained fully. Here we describe a high resolution crystal structure for UCH-L3 in a complex with the DUB inhibitor UbVME. The availability of the UCH-L3 structure in the unliganded state (11Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) now allows a precise definition of conformational changes that occur when Ub binds. Despite the low sequence identity between UCH-L3 and Yuh1 (30%), we observe a striking similarity between our structure and that of Yuh1 in complex with Ubal. This high degree of structural conservation suggests that the findings described by Johnston et al. (7Johnston S.C. Riddle S.M. Cohen R.E. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3877-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 11Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and in this report may well be common across the UCH family. Surprisingly, we observe a variation in the approach angle of Ub into the UCH-L3 active site cleft for the two complexes present in the asymmetric unit. The 10° rotation observed leads to the disruption of two sites of molecular contact between UCH-L3 and Ub. We therefore infer that these interactions are of lesser importance in substrate recognition by UCH-L3. These interactions were not observed in the Yuh1·Ubal structure, were not predicted based on NMR studies with UCH-L3 (20Wilkinson K.D. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1933-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), nor are these residues conserved among UCHs (Fig. 3), thus supporting this conclusion. In contrast, the importance of contacts between UCH-L3 and both the C terminus and the first N-terminal loop of Ub is underscored by the observation that these contact points remain fixed between both complexes. Consistent with previous biochemical and structural reports, the C terminus of Ub makes extensive interactions with the active site cleft of UCH-L3. Although the C-terminal di-glycine motif is present in many of the Ub-like modifiers (Nedd8, SUMO-1, ISG15, URM-1, Fau, FAT10) only Nedd8 and ISG15 contain the two critical arginine residues (Arg72 and Arg74 in Ub) that make extensive intermolecular contacts with UCH-L3 and Yuh1 (7Johnston S.C. Riddle S.M. Cohen R.E. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3877-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It is notable that UCH-L3 possesses Nedd8 hydrolytic activity (21Hemelaar J. Borodovsky A.

All six identifiable orthologs of the D. melanogaster Y-linked genes have autosomal inheritance in D. pseudoobscura.

We found 15 genes and pseudogenes in the current Y of D. pseudoobscura, and none are shared with the D. melanogaster Y.

Here, we monitored SNARE complex formation in vivo with the use of a fluorescent version of SNAP25. In PC12 cells, we found evidence for a syntaxin-SNAP25 complex that formed with high affinity, required only the amino-terminal SNARE motif of SNAP25, tolerated a mutation that blocks formation of other syntaxin-SNAP25 complexes, and assembled reversibly when Ca 2+ entered cells during depolarization. The complex may represent a precursor to the core complex formed during a Ca 2+ -dependent priming step of exocytosis."

To understand the effects of heterodimerization and ligand binding on coactivator recruitment, we solved the crystal structure of the complex between the RARβ/RXRα ligand-binding domain heterodimer, its 9-cis retinoic acid ligand, and an LXXLL-containing peptide (termed NR box 2) derived from the nuclear receptor interaction domain (NID) of the TRAP220 coactivator. In parallel, we measured the binding affinities of the isolated NR box 2 peptide or the full-length NID of the coactivator SRC-1 for retinoid receptors in the presence of various types of ligands. Our correlative analysis of three-dimensional structures and fluorescence data reveals that heterodimerization does not significantly alter the structure of individual subunits or their intrinsic capacity to interact with NR box 2. Similarly, we show that the ability of a protomer to recruit NR box 2 does not vary as a function of the ligand binding status of the partner receptor. In contrast, the strength of the overall association between the heterodimer and the full-length SRC-1 NID is dictated by the combinatorial action of RAR and RXR ligands, the simultaneous presence of the two receptor agonists being required for highest binding affinity. We identified an LXXLL peptide-driven mechanism by which the concerted reorientation of three phenylalanine side chains generates an “aromatic clamp” that locks the RXR activation helix H12 in the transcriptionally active conformation. Finally, we show how variations of helix H11-ligand interactions can alter the communication pathway linking helices H11, H12, and the connecting loop L11-12 to the coactivator-binding site.

Although RARs bind and are activated by both the 9-cis and the all-trans isomers of the retinoic acid, RXRs are exclusively activated by the 9-cis isomer (8Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A.

Like other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, retinoid receptors are modular and include an N-terminal A/B activation domain, a central DNA-binding domain (region C), a linker region D, a ligand-binding domain (region E), and a C-terminal region F of unknown structure and function. The ligand-binding domain (LBD) is a multifunctional domain, capable of ligand binding, dimerization, and interaction with transcriptional coregulators. Previous studies have shown that retinoid actions are predominantly mediated through the formation of heterodimers between the various RAR and RXR isotypes. The RAR/RXR heterodimers can operate as either transcriptional repressors or activators. The silencing activity involves the establishment of transcription repressing complexes in which corepressors are recruited to receptor heterodimers in the absence of ligand (apo-receptors) (11Horlein A.J.

Binding of agonists (holo-receptors) triggers a mechanism by which the most C-terminal LBD helix H12, encompassing the core of the functionally conserved activation function 2 (AF-2), is repositioned in a so-called active- or holo-conformation, thereby creating a binding surface that facilitates interaction with coactivator proteins and concomitantly decreases the affinity for corepressors (16Bourguet W.

Transcriptional coactivators including those of the SRC-1/p160 family and the TRAP complex are involved in chromatin remodeling or recruitment of the basal transcription machinery and interact with nuclear receptors via short LXXLL helical motifs, so-called NR boxes, present as multiple copies in their nuclear receptor interaction domain (NID) (20Chen J.D.

In an effort to gain new insights into the molecular mechanism of the RAR/RXR-coactivator interaction, we solved the crystal structure of the RARβ/RXRα LBD heterodimer in complex with 9C-RA and a 13-residue fragment containing the NR box 2 of the coactivator TRAP220. Furthermore, we used fluorescence anisotropy to characterize in a quantitative manner the interaction between the transcriptional coactivator SRC-1 and monomeric or heterodimeric retinoid receptors bound to a variety of ligands. Based on these structural and biophysical studies, we propose a model of the RAR/RXR-SRC-1 interaction to understand how dimerization and ligand binding influence coactivator recruitment.

Briefly, after a first step of a nickel affinity column (HiTrap chelating column, Amersham Biosciences), the fractions containing the eluted heterodimer were pooled and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5-fold molar excess of 9C-RA and thrombin to remove the His tag. The protein was further purified using a Superdex 75 26/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and mixed with 2-fold molar excess of 9C-RA and 3-fold molar excess of TRAP220 NR box 2 peptide (641NHPMLMNLLKDNPA654). The purified complex was concentrated to 15 mg·ml-1 and centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 rpm prior to crystallization assays.

In this model, all water and ligand molecules were removed as well as the RARα and RXRα C-terminal helices H12 that were expected to adopt different conformations in the two dimers. The phases from the molecular replacement solution were refined with solvent flattening and 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging as implemented in the CCP4 dm program. The produced map was very clear for the RARβ and the RXRα LBDs, the TRAP220 peptides, and the 9C-RA ligands. Multiple cycles of manual model building, including conversion of side chains from RARα to RARβ sequence, were carried out with the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M.

The ligand as well as key residues discussed under “Results and Discussion” are depicted as thick lines. Red arrows indicate a concerted mechanism initiated by the binding of the LXXLL motif and ending with the formation of an aromatic clamp (involving Phe282, Phe442, and Phe455) that locks H12 in the active conformation.

Transcriptional activity of wild-type (wt) and mutant RXRα were analyzed by transient transactivation assays in Cos1 cells with the indicated RXRα (mutant) expression vectors and the DR1-tk-CAT reporter gene. Impairment of the transcriptional activity of RXRα by the F442A and F282A mutations underscores the importance of the aromatic clamp for holoH12 stabilization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Structural comparison of fully agonistic and antagonistic conformations of RAR/RXR LBD heterodimers.

The agonist- and the antagonist-bound heterodimers are shown in blue and green, respectively. In both complexes, helices H12 are colored in red. The TRAP220 peptide is depicted in yellow. Selected secondary structural elements are labeled. This figure shows that the structural differences between the two dimers are primarily located in the extreme C-terminal portion of the LBD comprising helices H11 and H12 as well as loop L11-12.

Titrations of fluorescein-labeled SRC-1 NR box 2 by RARβ (B) and RARα LBDs (C), in the absence (apo) or in the presence of various agonists. In keeping with the structural differences observed between the RARβ/9C-RA and RARβ/TTNPB complexes, synthetic retinoids (TTNPB or AM80) activate RARα and RARβ more efficiently than does 9C-RA.

The buffer solution for assays was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. All ligands (Table II) were present at concentrations above their respective Kd values for binding to RAR and RXR and also at sufficient concentration to saturate both receptors. For the fluorescent peptide, due to the rapid establishment of the equilibrium, the measurements were initiated at the highest concentration of protein, and then the sample was diluted successively by a factor of 0.75 with the buffer containing 2 nm of fluorescent peptide, allowing us to establish the titration curve. In contrast, for titration of the labeled SRC-1570-780 fragment, samples corresponding to each point of the titration curve were prepared in advance and incubated for 1 h. In all cases, for each titration point, anisotropy was measured successively until stabilized, and the reported values are the average of four measurements after stabilization. Binding data were analyzed using the package BIOEQS (34Royer C.A. Smith W.R. Beechem J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Binding profiles were fit using a simple model assuming the stoichiometry of one SRC-1 by species (RAR/RXR heterodimer or RXR and RAR monomers). To determine affinities of other coactivator peptides for RAR and RXR, we used a strategy of competition. Prior to performing the assays, we estimated the ideal working concentrations of both protein partner and competitor peptide by simulating curves with BIOEQS. Finally, the fluorescent peptide was competed with increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor peptide in the presence of a constant concentration of partner receptor. AM80 and CD3254 were used in the titrations as reference agonist ligands for RARα and RXRα, respectively. All Kd values are reported in Tables III and IV.Table IIChemical structure and selectivity of agonists and antagonists used in this studyTable IIIBinding affinities of coactivator fragments for retinoid receptor LBDs Dissociation constants of NR boxes complexed with RARα and RXRα LBDs are shown.

Ten nanograms of expression vectors pSG5-mRXRα wild type, F282A, F442A, and F443A were transfected together with 100 ng of DR1-tk-CAT reporter construct and 25 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase used as internal control to normalize for transfection efficiency. The total quantity of DNA was adjusted to 1 μg. 15 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and supplemented with fresh medium with or without 9C-RA for an additional 24 h. Intracellular levels of CAT were measured using a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Structure Determination—The purified heterodimer of E. coli-expressed LBDs of mouse RARβ2 (fragment 146-448, containing the entire D, E, and F regions) and mouse RXRα1 (fragment 227-467, containing the entire E region) was crystallized in the presence of 9C-RA and a synthetic peptide containing the second LXXLL motif (NR box 2) of the NID of the human TRAP220 coactivator (fragment 641-654). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using a truncated version of the previously determined RARα/RXRα heterodimer structure (see “Experimental Procedures”) as the search probe. Two solutions were obtained from the molecular replacement search with a correlation coefficient of 0.269 (next highest solution 0.189) and an R-factor of 0.575 consistent with two complexes in the asymmetric unit. The final solution comprising two heterodimers had a correlation coefficient of 0.472 (next highest solution 0.240) and an R-factor of 0.492. As the unliganded and H12-deleted heterodimer had been used for phasing, the very clear densities for the ligand in RARβ and RXRα LBDs and the continuous electron density observed for helix H12 of the two protomers confirmed the accuracy of the solution. The asymmetric unit contains two heterodimers, with each subunit binding one TRAP220 NR box 2 peptide and one ligand. Helix H2, the connection between H2 and H3 in RXRα, the D-region and the last 30 residues of the F-region in RARβ, could not be modeled due to poor electron density in these regions. The final model, refined to 2.9-Å resolution, comprises 462 protein and 21 peptide residues, 2 ligands, and 5 water molecules. The collection data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final Rcryst and Rfree were 0.253 and 0.296, respectively, using all the data in the resolution range of 30-2.9 Å. PROCHECK analysis (31Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that there were no residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The geometry was very good, and the overall G factor was 0.17.

Several lines of evidence indicate that fibrillar Aβ and especially soluble Aβ aggregates are important in the etiology of AD. Recent reports also stress that amyloid aggregates are polymorphic and that a single polypeptide can fold into multiple amyloid conformations. Here we demonstrate that Aβ-(1–40) can form soluble aggregates with predominant β-structures that differ in stability and morphology. One class of aggregates involved soluble Aβ protofibrils, prepared by vigorous overnight agitation of monomeric Aβ-(1–40) at low ionic strength. Dilution of these aggregation reactions induced disaggregation to monomers as measured by size exclusion chromatography. Protofibril concentrations monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence decreased in at least two kinetic phases, with initial disaggregation (rate constant ∼1 h–1) followed by a much slower secondary phase. Incubation of the reactions without agitation resulted in less disaggregation at slower rates, indicating that the protofibrils became progressively more stable over time. In fact, protofibrils isolated by size exclusion chromatography were completely stable and gave no disaggregation. A second class of soluble Aβ aggregates was generated rapidly (<10 min) in buffered 2% hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). These aggregates showed increased thioflavin T fluorescence and were rich in β-structure by circular dichroism. Electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed initial globular clusters that progressed over several days to soluble fibrous aggregates. When diluted out of HFIP, these aggregates initially were very unstable and disaggregated completely within 2 min. However, their stability increased as they progressed to fibers. Relative to Aβ protofibrils, the HFIP-induced aggregates seeded elongation by Aβ monomer deposition very poorly. The techniques used to distinguish these two classes of soluble Aβ aggregates may be useful in characterizing Aβ aggregates formed in vivo.

The brains of patients with AD contain large numbers of amyloid deposits in the form of senile plaques (1Cohen A.S. Calkins E. Nature. 1959; 183: 1202-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The amyloid core of these plaques contains interwoven fibrils that are composed of 40- and 42-residue peptides (2Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar, 3Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A. Styles J. Bobin S.A. Lin Y.Y. Biemann K. Iqbal K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), denoted Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42). These peptides are produced by cleavage of cellular amyloid precursor protein by two proteases called β- and γ-secretase (reviewed in Ref. 4Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar). As originally suggested by the amyloid cascade hypothesis (5Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar), it appears likely that Aβ aggregates are important in the etiology of AD. The most striking evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from the identification of numerous mutations linked to early onset familial AD (6Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2002; 3: 67-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These mutations are located within the amyloid precursor protein gene or the genes for presenilins 1 and 2, which play an integral role in γ-secretase activity. All early onset familial AD mutations reported thus far increase either the level of the more amyloidogenic Aβ-(1–42) peptide (reviewed in Ref. 6Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2002; 3: 67-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) or the propensity of a mutated Aβ to form amyloid aggregates (7Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K. Forsell C. Stenh C. Luthman J. Teplow D.B. Younkin S.G. Naslund J. Lannfelt L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Whereas early evidence suggested that Aβ fibrils initiate a cascade of events that result in neuronal cell death (8Yankner B.A. Nat. Med. 1996; : 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), a number of investigators now propose that soluble aggregates of Aβ (also called oligomers or protofibrils), rather than monomers or insoluble amyloid fibrils, may be responsible for synaptic dysfunction in AD (9Hardy J.

They contain fully extended peptide segments that align to form β-sheets with the extended peptide strands perpendicular to and interstrand hydrogen bonds parallel to the fibril axis (17Sunde M. Serpell L.C. Bartlam M. Fraser P.E. Pepys M.B. Blake C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar, 18Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Benson M.D. Tennent G.A. Pepys M.B. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This cross-β structure may underlie common properties including the binding of dyes like thioflavin T and Congo Red and of antibodies that react with a common epitope in several amyloidogenic proteins (19O'Nuallain B. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 20Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3405) Google Scholar). However, recent reports also indicate a fascinating degree of amyloid polymorphism at the molecular level. This feature was first noted with mammalian and yeast prion proteins when it was shown that a single polypeptide can misfold into multiple amyloid conformations (21Chien P. Weissman J.S. DePace A.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Specifically, the yeast Sup35p prion protein was aggregated at different temperatures into amyloid conformations that could be distinguished by thermal stability and EPR spectroscopy, and infection of yeast with these different conformations led to different propagating yeast [PSI+] strains (22Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 23King C.Y. Diaz-Avalos R. Nature. 2004; 428: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Aβ fibrils also show molecular diversity. Solid state NMR measurements revealed that Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(1–42), and Aβ-(10–35) fibrils contained in-register, parallel β-sheets (24Tycko R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3151-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 25Burkoth T.S. Benzinger T.L.S. Urban V. Morgan D.M. Gregory D.M. Thiyagarajan P. Botto R.E. Meredith S.C. Lynn D.G. J.

Very recently, two types of amyloid fibrils were formed by Aβ-(1–40) following aggregation under mildly agitated or quiescent conditions, and chemical shift and line width data from solid-state NMR for 33 of the 40 residues indicated different underlying structures (29Tycko R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). 2Petkova, A. T., Leapman, R. D., Guo, Z., Yau, W. M., Mattson, M. P., and Tycko, R.

P., and Tycko, R. (2004) FASEB Meeting on Protein Misfolding, Amyloid and Conformational Disease, poster abstract, Snowmass, CO (June 12–17).Amyloid polymorphism is closely linked to the mechanism of Aβ fibril formation, which invitro is thought to involve nucleation-dependent polymerization (31Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 32Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In this process, monomeric Aβ associates noncovalently to form nuclei or “seeds,” which then grow into soluble protofibrils and insoluble fibrils. Nucleus formation is considered rate-limiting in this process, but this rate is highly variable even in homogeneous aqueous solutions and is sensitive to many conditions including pH, ionic strength, temperature, and agitation (33Wood S.J. Maleeff B. Hart T. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 34Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). If different nuclear structures form, the molecular structure of fibrils formed by polymerization will vary with the structure of the nucleus. One measure of this conformational specificity is the efficiency with which aggregates can “cross-seed,” or act as seeds for elongation by another or even the same amyloidogenic polypeptide (36O'Nuallain B. Williams A.D. Westermark P. Wetzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17490-17499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Nucleation in vivo may be promoted by interfaces, including phospholipid membranes. Anionic phospholipid vesicles (37Terzi E. Holzemann G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14845-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) as well as vesicles containing GM1 ganglioside (38Choo-Smith L.P. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Glabe C.G. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7385-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) promoted Aβ binding and β-structure formation in vitro.The emergence of amyloid polymorphism underscores the need for measures that would distinguish amyloid aggregates formed under different conditions. One measure that has received little attention is aggregate stability. In this report, we document the stability of Aβ-(1–40) protofibrils prepared in dilute buffer at neutral pH (35Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W-L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) by measuring their disaggregation rates following dilution. Isolated protofibrils became progressively more stable over time and reached a point where no disaggregation could be detected. This stability contrasted with that of Aβ aggregates generated at interfaces. We recently observed that Aβ-(1–40) aggregates formed rapidly at the interface of an aqueous solution over chloroform were relatively unstable, and their morphology differed significantly from that of Aβ-(1–40) protofibrils (41Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we extend this characterization to Aβ-(1–40) aggregates formed in dilute hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). High concentrations of the fluorinated alcohols trifluoroethanol (TFE) and HFIP have been popular agents for solubilizing peptides and proteins (42Buck M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 297-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The ability of these agents to induce α-helical conformations is well known, but they also promote other types of intramolecular hydrogen bonding including turns and β-hairpins (42Buck M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 297-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In solutions that contain more than 50% TFE, Aβ (43Fezoui Y. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36948-36954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and the amyloidogenic protein α-synuclein (44Li H.T. Du H.N. Tang L. Hu J. Hu H.Y. Biopolymers. 2002; 64: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) showed largely α-helical conformations, but in 20% TFE, both formed β-sheet aggregates at rates that were considerably faster than those in the absence of TFE. Padrick and Miranker (45Padrick S.B. Miranker A.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) recently reported that low concentrations of HFIP (1–4%) dramatically promoted amyloid fiber formation by islet amyloid polypeptide, and their observations encouraged us to examine Aβ in dilute HFIP. We found that Aβ-(1–40) also aggregated in dilute HFIP with rates that were several orders of magnitude faster than those observed in buffer alone. These HFIP aggregates, like the Aβ aggregates formed at the chloroform-buffer interface, gave CD spectra rich in β-structure, formed globular species that progressed to fibers based on EM and AFM images, and initially disaggregated rapidly on dilution. We propose that these features provide useful criteria for investigating the polymorphism of soluble Aβ aggregates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) peptides were obtained from QCB (Hopkinton, MA), from rPeptide (Athens, GA), and from the protein and peptide core facility at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN). [3H]HCHO was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and ARC (St. Louis, MO); scintillation mixture (Ultima Gold) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; and HFIP, EDTA, bovine serum albumin, and thioflavin T were from Sigma. HFIP stocks were redistilled prior to experimental use.Preparation of Aβ Monomers—Aβ-(1–40) peptide was obtained in lyophilized form and stored at –20 °C, desiccated until reconstitution, either in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, at 3–4 mg/ml (460–930 μm) or in deionized water (18 megaohms; Millipore Milli-Q system) at 2.5 mg/ml (580 mm). Aliquots of the water stocks were flash frozen in ethanol/dry ice, stored at –80 °C, and thawed at room temperature when needed. Any preformed aggregates were removed from stock solutions by SEC on Superdex 75, and concentrations of Aβ (shown under “Results” to be monomeric) were determined by absorbance with a calculated extinction coefficient of 1450 cm–1 m–1 at 276 nm as previously described (35Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W-L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In some experiments, Aβ peptides were radiolabeled by reductive methylation of primary and secondary amino groups (46Means G.E. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as described previously (35Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W-L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). [3H]HCHO was used directly (98 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or after dilution (10 Ci/mmol; ARC) with unlabeled HCHO. The reaction converted the ϵ-amino groups of two lysine residues (Lys16 and Lys28) and the α-amino group of the N-terminal residue (Asp1) to labeled dimethylamines (35Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W-L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), with specific activities of 400–1100 dpm/pmol of Aβ.Preparation of Aβ Protofibrils—SEC-purified monomeric Aβ-(1–40) (100–140 μm) was incubated in 0.5–1 ml of 5–50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA (sodium salt), pH 8.0 (5–50 mm Tris-EDTA), at room temperature and agitated vigorously by continued vortexing to promote aggregation (35Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W-L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Aggregation was monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence (35Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W-L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 51LeVine H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar), and the sample was microcentrifuged for 10 min in a tabletop centrifuge (Beckman Coulter) at 18,000 × g. The supernatant was chromatographed on a 1 × 30-cm Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), and Aβ eluting in the void volume was defined as the protofibril fraction (35Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W-L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Superdex columns were routinely pretreated with a bolus of BSA (50 mg) in running buffer to block nonspecific binding of Aβ protofibrils to the resin followed by a wash with at least 4 column volumes of running buffer. The columns also were occasionally washed with 1 n NaOH.Circular Dichroism—Spectra were obtained on an Aviv model 215 circular dichroism spectrometer with a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette (Hellma) (41Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Buffer control spectra were averaged and subtracted from the average of triplicate scans of each Aβ sample spectra, and each resulting point ([θ]obs, degrees) was converted to mean residue ellipticity ([θ], degrees cm2 dmol–1) with the equation, [θ] = [θ]obs× (MRW/10lc), where MRW is the mean residue molecular weight of Aβ-(1–40) (4331 g/mol divided by 40 residues), l is the optical path length (cm), and c is the concentration (g/cm3). Estimates of the predominant secondary structure were verified using the modified Contin method (CONTINLL) available through the CDPro suite of analysis programs with basis set 7 of the reference protein data base (47Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar).Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)—Hydrodynamic radius (RH) measurements were made at room temperature with a DynaPro MSX instrument (Protein Solutions Inc., Piscataway, NJ) equipped with a gallium aluminum arsenide laser. Samples (60 μl) were placed directly into a quartz cuvette, and total light scattering intensity at a 90° angle in kilocounts/s was collected using a 5-s acquisition time. Particle translational diffusion coefficients (DT) were calculated from autocorrelated light intensity data (usually 20–25 points) and converted to RH with the Stokes-Einstein equation (RH = kbT/6π ηDT). A histogram of percentage intensity versus RH was calculated using Dynamics data analysis software (Protein Solutions), and intensity-weighted mean RH values were obtained for each subpeak.Multiangle Light Scattering (MALS)—Samples were applied to a Superdex 75 SEC column attached to an ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system and analyzed in-line with a DAWN EOS MALS instrument (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) (35Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W-L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Analysis of MALS data was based on the Zimm formalism of the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans model (48Debye P. J. Phys. Colloid Chem. 1947; 51: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 49Zimm B.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1948; 16: 1093-1099Crossref Scopus (1165) Google Scholar), as presented previously (35Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W-L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In brief, the excess Rayleigh ratio Rθ is related to the molecular structure according to Equation 1, KcRθ=1MP(θ)+2A2c(Eq. 1) where Rθ is proportional to the fraction of incident light that is scattered by the solute without interference; K is a physical constant equal to 4π2(dn/dc)2no 2NA–1λo–4, where n represents the refractive index of the solution, c is the solute concentration (g/ml), no is the refractive index of the solvent, NA is Avagadro's number, and λo is the wavelength of the incident light in vacuum; A2 is the second virial coefficient; and M is the molecular mass of the solute. At the low concentrations c employed in this study, the 2A2c term in Equation 1 may be ignored. The function P(θ) is the ratio of the scattered light intensity to the scattered light intensity without interference. For larger molecules whose size approaches λo, the reciprocal P–1(θ) may be expressed by the power series in Equation 2, P−1(θ)=1+q2Rg23+…(Eq. 2) where q = (4π no/λo)sin(θ/2), θ is the angle between the incident and the scattered light, and Rg is the root mean square radius of gyration. According to Equations 1 and 2, a Zimm plot of Kc/Rθ as a polynomial in q2 gives (M)–1 as the y axis intercept and R 2g/3M as the limiting slope as θ approaches zero. When the solute is polydisperse, M and Rg become the weight-average molecular mass (Mw) and the z-average radius of gyration (Rgz), respectively. For very small molecules, P(θ) is equal to 1, and little slope is observed in the Kc/Rθ versus q2 plot. This precludes Rgz determination but still allows Mw measurements if the concentration is known. Definitive concentration measurements from radioactivity allowed Mw determination of radiomethylated, monomeric Aβ-(1–40).Electron Microscopy (EM)—Samples of Aβ aggregates were applied to 200-mesh Formvar-coated copper grids (Ernest F. Fullam, Inc., Latham, NY) and incubated for 10–15 min at room temperature. The sample was then wicked off with lens paper, washed briefly by placing the grid face down on a wash droplet, and stained by transferring the grid face down to a droplet of 2% uranyl acetate (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) for 5–10 min before wicking off the solution and air drying. With samples generated in 2% HFIP, all wash and treatment solutions applied to the grids also contained 2% HFIP. Grids were visualized in a Philips EM208S transmission electron microscope.Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)—Images were obtained as described previously (35Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W-L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In brief, samples were applied to freshly cleaved mica that had been modified with 3′-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane and incubated for 15 min. The residual sample liquid was aspirated off, and the disk was then rinsed gently with water containing 2% HFIP and blown dry with compressed air. A Nanoscope III controller with a Multimode AFM (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) was used for imaging by ambient tapping mode. Images here are presented in amplitude mode, where increasing brightness indicates greater damping of cantilever oscillation (34Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Height mode images were “flattened” prior to the measurement of particle height distributions with NanoScope® III software (version 5.13r5; Digital Instruments).RESULTSDissociation of Aβ Aggregates—Aggregates were prepared from unlabeled or radiomethylated Aβ-(1–40) monomer that had been purified by SEC (35Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W-L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Radiomethylation of Aβ-(1–40) converts the primary amino groups on residues Asp1, Lys16, and Lys28 to radiolabeled dimethylamines. This modification slows the assembly kinetics but does not affect the morphology of protofibrils or fibrils (35Nichols M.R. Moss M.A. Reed D.K. Lin W-L. Mukhopadhyay R. Hoh J.H. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6115-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and it significantly enhances the detection of Aβ. The monomeric nature of low molecular weight Aβ obtained from SEC was confirmed by multiangle light scattering in tandem with SEC. This analysis was conducted with radiomethylated Aβ for better quantitation and indicated a Mw of 4670 ± 90 (calculated MW 4415 for the hexamethylated 1–40"
https://openalex.org/W2133772521,"Ca2+ regulates a spectrum of cellular processes including many aspects of neuronal function. Ca2+-sensitive events such as neurite extension and axonal guidance are driven by Ca2+ signals that are precisely organized in both time and space. These complex cues result from both Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane and the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. In the present study, using rat cortical neurons, we have examined the effects of the novel intracellular Ca2+-mobilizing messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) on neurite length and cytosolic Ca2+ levels. We show that NAADP potentiates neurite extension in response to serum and nerve growth factor and stimulates increases in cytosolic Ca2+ from bafilomycin-sensitive Ca2+ stores. Simultaneous blockade of inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors abolished the effects of NAADP on neurite length and reduced the magnitude of NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signals. This is the first report demonstrating functional NAADP receptors in a mammalian neuron. Interplay between NAADP receptors and more established intracellular Ca2+ channels may therefore play important signaling roles in the nervous system.

Interplay between NAADP receptors and more established intracellular Ca2+ channels may therefore play important signaling roles in the nervous system. Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration regulate a whole host of cellular processes (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). In neurons, Ca2+ controls crucial events such as neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity (2Miller R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. (N. Y.). 1991; 37: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 3Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signals are generated by opening of Ca2+ channels located both on the cell surface and the membranes of intracellular Ca2+ stores (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that in addition to inositol trisphosphate (4Taylor C.W. Biochim. Biophys.

In the sea urchin egg, in which the effects of NAADP were first characterized, NAADP targets Ca2+ channels with biochemical (10Berridge G. Dickinson G. Parrington J. Galione A. Patel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43717-43723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and pharmacological (11Genazzani A.A. Mezna M. Dickey D.M. Michelangeli F. Walseth T.F. Galione A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) properties distinct from those of inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors. In addition, these channels appear to be expressed on lysosome-like acidic organelles (the reserve granules) (12Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Thus, NAADP-induced Ca2+ release is inhibited by agents that dissipate proton gradients but is readily demonstrable in the presence of thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca2+ pumps on the endoplasmic reticulum (12Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). NAADP receptors are also unusual in that receptors can, under certain conditions, inactivate before activation (13Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 14Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Despite the propensity of the release process to inactivate, however, NAADP initiates complex Ca2+ signals in a variety of systems (7Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This is all the more paradoxical given the inability of NAADP receptors to directly support regenerative Ca2+ release through the process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (15Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Rather, it appears that activation of NAADP receptors provides a trigger release of Ca2+ that is then amplified by inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors (7Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 14Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Proper development of the central nervous system requires the formation of appropriate synaptic contacts between neurons (16Song H.-J. Poo M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 3: E81-E88Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Neurons are capable of extending axons over considerable distances, a process that involves signaling events within the growth cone in response to a variety of extracellular cues (16Song H.-J. Poo M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 3: E81-E88Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The underlying signal transduction pathways, however, are not well defined, although Ca2+ is likely to play key roles (17Kater S.B. Mills L.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 891-899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both spontaneous entry of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane and Ca2+ entry in response to guidance cues such as cell adhesion molecules are crucial for various aspects of neuronal growth (18Gomez T.M. Spitzer N.C. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 44: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Indeed, both the temporal and spatial organization of the ensuing Ca2+ signal are likely an important determinant of the growth response. In Xenopus spinal neurons, for example, Zheng (19Zheng J.Q.

In addition to the well-characterized role of Ca2+ influx, the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores through activation of both inositol trisphosphate (20Takei K. Shin R.M. Inoue T. Kato K.

Nature. 2000; 403: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) receptors has also been implicated in the control of neuronal growth. The role of NAADP in process outgrowth, however, has yet to be defined. Although the Ca2+ mobilizing properties of NAADP have been characterized in a variety of cells, corresponding information for neurons is scant, as is knowledge of the downstream consequences of NAADP receptor activation. We therefore investigated possible functional effects of NAADP in mammalian neurons. Our data show for the first time that NAADP-mediated Ca2+ changes, through the mobilization of acidic Ca2+ stores and subsequent amplification by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, are likely to be important in regulating neurite extension. Neuronal Cell Culture—Neurons were isolated from the cerebral cortex of newborn rats (4–6 days old) as described previously (24Brailoiu E. Hoard J. Brailoiu G.C. Chi M. Godbole R. Dun N.J. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 365: 10-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) by enzymatic digestion using 0.5 mg papain/100 mg tissue. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% O2 + 5% CO2 in Neurobasal-A™ medium alone or with the following additions: (i) 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, (ii) B27 supplement, (iii) B27 supplement + 20 ng/ml NGF (all from Invitrogen), or (iv) B27 supplement + 1 mmN6,O2-dibutyryl sodium salt 3′,5′-cyclic AMP (Calbiochem). All culture media contained 20 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were used 2 or 48 h after isolation. In the latter case, glial cell growth was inhibited by addition of the mitotic inhibitor, cytosine β-arabino furanoside (1 μm; Sigma). Cells were treated with liposomes and cell-permeable antagonists in basal medium + B27 supplement for 30 min before transfer to the appropriate medium in the continued presence of the drugs. Liposome Preparation—NAADP (1–100 μm), Lucifer yellow (10 μm), or heparin (10 mg/ml) was dissolved in 140 mm KCl and incorporated into liposomes prepared using egg phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) at a 5:1 molar ratio (4 mg lipid/ml aqueous phase) as described previously (25Brailoiu E. Miyamoto M.D. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Brailoiu E. Patel S. Dun N.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unincorporated constituents were removed by dialysis (Sigma dialysis sacs; molecular weight cutoff, 12,400) against Neurobasal-A™ medium (for culture experiments) or Hank's balanced salt solution (for Ca2+ measurements) (1:600 (v/v); 150 min; solution change every 30 min). Liposomes were used at a 1:20 (v/v) final dilution. Immunocytochemistry—Cells that had been treated with control liposomes or Lucifer yellow-filled liposomes (see above) were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing freshly prepared 0.2% (w/v) picric acid and 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (20 min). After sequential incubations (in phosphate-buffered saline) with blocking solution (10% (v/v) normal horse serum), primary antibody (anti-mouse neuron-specific enolase IgG; 1:300 dilution; 4 h; Chemicon International), secondary antibody (biotinylated anti-mouse IgG; 1:50 dilution; 1 h; Vector Laboratories), and fluorophore (Avidin Texas Red; 1:50 dilution; 3 h; Vector Laboratories), the coverslips were mounted in Citifluor medium (Ted Pella) for viewing. Lucifer yellow fluorescence and Texas Red fluorescence were captured with a confocal scanning laser microscope (Leica TCS SP2) using excitation/emission wavelengths of 457/520 and 543/620 nm, respectively. Measurement of Neurite Length—Cells were fixed as described above, and only individual neurons without contacts were used for measurements. The length of the longest neurite (from the cell body to the growth cone tip) was measured using transmitted light images captured with a Leica confocal microscope. For each treatment, a total of 600 neurites (100 neurites per independent culture) were analyzed. Measurement of Cytosolic Ca2+Concentration—Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration measurements were performed as described previously (27Filipeanu C.M. Brailoiu E. Le Dun S. Dun N.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly dissociated neurons (2 h after isolation) were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 by incubation of the cells in Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with 3 μm Fura-2/AM for 45 min and Hank's balanced salt solution alone for an additional 15–60 min (to allow de-esterification of the dye). Coverslips were placed in a custom-designed bath and transferred to the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with a C & L Instruments fluorometer system. Cells were perfused at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min, and Fura-2 fluorescence (excitation wavelength = 340 and 380 nm, emission wave-length = 520 nm) of single cells was acquired at a frequency of 1 Hz. The ratio of the fluorescence signals obtained (340/380 nm) was converted to Ca2+ concentration according to Grynkiewicz et al. (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have previously used the liposome technique to effect intracellular delivery of various cell impermeant molecules including NAADP (26Brailoiu E. Patel S. Dun N.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Brailoiu E. Miyamoto M.D. Dun N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 718-724PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology in rat cortical neurons, we first characterized delivery of the fluorescent marker Lucifer yellow. Cells were clearly fluorescent when cultures were perfused with liposomes prepared in the presence of the dye (Fig. 1A). In contrast, little fluorescence was detected under the same conditions using liposomes filled with buffer alone (Fig. 1C). Immunocytochemical analysis with a primary antibody raised to neuron-specific enolase confirmed that imaged cells were neurons (Fig. 1, B and D). NAADP has been shown to modulate neurotransmitter release at cholinergic synapses in the buccal ganglion of Aplysia (30Chameau P. Van de Vrede Y. Fossier P. Baux G. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 443: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the frog neuromuscular junction (26Brailoiu E. Patel S. Dun N.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Brailoiu E. Miyamoto M.D. Dun N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 718-724PubMed Google Scholar). To explore possible functional consequences of NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increases in rat cortical neurons, we examined the effects of NAADP on neurite extension. When neurons were cultured in the presence of serum, NGF, or cyclic AMP, neurite growth was initiated such that after 2 days in culture, average neurite length was 40 ± 2, 39 ± 2, and 36 ± 2 μm, respectively (n = 600; Fig. 2, A, C, and E). NAADP-containing liposomes (100 μm) dramatically potentiated neurite extension in response to both serum (Fig. 2B) and NGF (Fig. 2D). The effect of NAADP was concentration-dependent (Fig. 3A). Rightward shifts in Kolmogorov-Smirnov plots indicate that NAADP stimulated neurite growth in all neurons (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, NAADP did not affect neurite length in medium supplemented with cell-permeable cyclic AMP (Figs. 2, E and F, and 3A) or initiate neurite extension in control basal medium with or without B27 supplement (Fig. 2, G–J). NAADP-induced Ca2+ release is therefore not sufficient to induce neurite extension but appears instead to play a specific modulatory role in serum- and NGF-mediated neuronal growth. Liposomal application of either inositol trisphosphate or cyclic ADP-ribose (100 μm) also potentiated neurite extension (data not shown).Fig. 3Effects of NAADP on neurite length.A, effect of NAADP on neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons cultured for 2 days in medium supplemented with liposomes containing the indicated concentration of NAADP and either serum (•), NGF (○), or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (□).

Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Similarly, neurotransmission at the frog neuromuscular junction in response to NAADP and endoplasmic reticulum-based Ca2+-mobilizing messengers displays marked synergism (26Brailoiu E. Patel S. Dun N.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Such orchestration of the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores by NAADP could underlie the potentiating effects of NAADP on neurite extension reported here. We therefore examined the effects of inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptor antagonists on the stimulation of neurite length by NAADP. Ryanodine, xestospongin C, and heparin caused a modest (<20%) inhibition of neurite length after culture in the presence of serum (Table I). Stimulation of neuronal growth by NAADP, however, was largely unaffected by the antagonists (Table I). In contrast, in the presence of a combination of xestospongin C and ryanodine, which inhibited neurite extension by 28 ± 2%, stimulation by NAADP was almost completely abolished (Table I). Thus, whereas NAADP increased neurite length 1.4-fold in control experiments, in the presence of both inhibitors, stimulation was only 1.1-fold. Essentially similar results were obtained in response to a combination of heparin and ryanodine (Table I). Potentiation of neurite extension by NAADP in the presence of NGF was also much more sensitive to simultaneous block of both inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors than to inhibition of only one class of channels (Table I). These data uncover a requirement for Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in mediating the effects of NAADP on neuronal growth. Moreover, there appears to be functional redundancy in the use of inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors in cortical neurons, as is the case during fertilization of sea urchin eggs (31Lee H.C.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether Ca2+ entry through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels could affect neuronal growth, we examined the effect of elevated K+ (6 mm) on neurite length. Stimulation of Ca2+ entry potentiated neurite extension 1.3-fold in serum-containing medium and 1.4-fold in the presence of NGF (Table I). Higher concentrations of K+ (25 mm) were toxic (data not shown). As with NAADP, the effects of depolarization were only modestly affected by inositol trisphosphate or ryanodine receptor antagonists when applied alone (Table I). Additionally, only after simultaneous blockade of the channels were the effects of K+ on neurite length prevented (Table I). Thus, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release likely amplifies the effects of both NAADP and Ca2+ entry through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Although NAADP has been demonstrated to stimulate Ca2+ release from broken rat brain preparations (34Bak J. White P. Timar G. Missiaen L. Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), nothing is known concerning its action in living mammalian neurons. We therefore examined the effects of NAADP on cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in our neuronal cultures. Perfusion of neurons with liposomes filled with buffer only had little effect on cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 4A). Subsequent perfusion with NAADP-filled liposomes (100 μm), however, markedly increased cytolsolic Ca2+ by 58 ± 2nm (n = 6). Importantly, Ca2+ responses to NAADP were abolished by the V-type ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 4B; n = 6). Bafilomycin A1, however, did not affect Ca2+ increases elicited in response to depolarization of the plasma membrane. Perfusion of cells with elevated K+ (25 mm) increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration by 96 ± 3 nm (n = 6) and 112 ± 4 nm (n = 6) in the absence and presence of bafilomycin, respectively. These experiments show for the first time that NAADP mediates increases in cytosolic Ca2+ in mammalian neurons and that these Ca2+ increases likely result from mobilization of acidic Ca2+ stores. 2Prolonged incubation of neurons with bafilomycin caused cell death (data not shown), precluding its use to probe the role of acidic Ca2+ stores in controlling neurite extension. The latter findings concur with recent reports identifying NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ stores as reserve granules in sea urchin eggs (12Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and secretory granules in MIN-6 cells (35Mitchell K.J. Lai F.A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol.

NAADP may also target lysosome-related Ca2+ stores in pancreatic acinar cells (36Yamasaki M. Masgrau R. Morgan A.J. Churchill G.C. Patel S. Ashcroft S.J.H. Galione A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54319-54326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, expression of NAADP receptors in cortical neurons is consistent with our previous autoradiographical analysis of NAADP binding sites in adult rat brain (38Patel S. Churchill G.C. Sharp T. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36495-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signals were significantly inhibited but not abolished by a combination of xestospongin C and ryanodine (Fig. 4C). Ca2+ increases in response to NAADP were 58 ± 2 and 39 ± 3 nm in the absence and presence of the inhibitors, respectively. High K+-induced Ca2+ increases (114 ± 5nm; Fig. 4C), however, were similar to those in control experiments (96 ± 3 nm; Fig. 4A). Thus, consistent with the effect of the antagonists on the potentiation of neurite growth by NAADP (Table I), Ca2+ increases stimulated by NAADP are amplified by inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors. NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increases were readily demonstrable in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4D) and in the presence of thapsigargin (Fig. 4E); peak Ca2+ increases were 46 ± 3 and 37 ± 3 nm, respectively (n = 6). Our demonstration of NAADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization in individual neurons, together with previous radiotracer flux studies using brain microsomes (34Bak J. White P. Timar G. Missiaen L. Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the distinct regional distribution of NAADP binding sites compared with inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors (38Patel S. Churchill G.C. Sharp T. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36495-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that dedicated Ca2+ channels sensitive to NAADP are expressed in the brain. Importantly, we show that their activation modulates a crucial aspect of neuronal growth and that this effect and part of the generated Ca2+ signal is dependent upon recruitment of endoplasmic reticulum-based Ca2+ release pathways. Cross-talk between intracellular Ca2+ channels in mammalian neurons then appears very similar to that in sea urchin eggs (39Churchill G.C. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38687-38692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells (40Boittin F.X. Galione A. Evans A.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 91: 1168-1175Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar), in which both the trigger and amplifier components of the NAADP-induced Ca2+ signal are readily resolvable. The situation, however, is different from channel “chatter” (7Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in pancreatic acinar cells (14Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In these cells, NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signals are completely blocked by antagonists of inositol trisphosphate or ryanodine receptors, which reflects either a lower density of NAADP receptors (41Patel S. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or perhaps a more direct interaction of NAADP with the ryanodine receptor (42Gerasimenko J.V. Maruyama Y. Yano K. Dolman N. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that although inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptor antagonists have only modest effects on NAADP-induced Ca2+ signals in neurons, they are, in combination, able to effectively block the potentiating effects of NAADP on neurite length. These data suggest that the NAADP-stimulated trigger Ca2+ signal is not sufficient to mediate the observed functional effects. Regardless of the exact mode of action of NAADP, the present data support a key role for NAADP in Ca2+-dependent neuronal function. Indeed, NAADP metabolism by brain membranes is stimulated by Ca2+, providing a potential mechanism for the tight control of NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signals (43Berridge G. Cramer R. Galione A. Patel S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and CD38, a candidate enzyme for the synthesis of NAADP (44Lee H.C. Chem.

We reported recently that this NHE3 translocation requires ezrin phosphorylation. However, the kinase that phosphorylates ezrin in this process has not been identified. Because Akt has also been implicated in NHE3 translocation, we investigated the hypothesis that Akt phosphorylates ezrin. After initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport, Akt is activated with kinetics that parallel those of ezrin phosphorylation. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase, which blocks ezrin phosphorylation, also prevents Akt activation. Purified Akt directly phosphorylates recombinant ezrin at threonine 567 in vitro in an ATP-dependent manner. This in vitro phosphorylation can be prevented by Akt inhibitors. In intact cells, inhibition of either phosphoinositide 3-kinase, an upstream regulator of Akt, or inhibition of Akt itself using inhibitors validated in vitro prevents ezrin phosphorylation after initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport. Specific small interfering RNA knockdown of Akt2 prevented ezrin phosphorylation in intact cells. Pharmacological Akt inhibition or Akt2 knockdown also prevented NHE3 translocation and activation after initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport, confirming the functional role of Akt2.

Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). These proteins share at least 70% sequence homology and a common structure (2Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 3Turunen O. Wahlstrom T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Ezrin activity is regulated by intramolecular interactions between N- and C-terminal ERM association domains. In the inactive state, these intramolecular interactions mask protein 4.1-ERM and actin-binding domains (4Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 5Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol.

Chambers D. Ingraffea J. Faber H.R. Karplus P.A. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), resulting in inactive ezrin monomers and oligomers. Ezrin phosphorylation at threonine 567 releases these intramolecular interactions, allowing active ezrin monomers to link target molecules to the actin cytoskeleton (8Fievet B.T. Gautreau A. Roy C. Maestro DelL. Mangeat P. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 9Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. J.

Thus, phosphorylation at threonine 567 is a critical regulator of ezrin function. Given the widespread involvement of ezrin family members in diverse cellular functions, it is not surprising that several kinases have been implicated in threonine 567 ezrin phosphorylation. Protein kinase C (PKC) α, PKCθ, and rho kinase have all been implicated in ezrin phosphorylation (9Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 11Ng T. Parsons M. Hughes W.E. Monypenny J. Zicha D. Gautreau A. Arpin M. Gschmeissner S. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I.

Biol. 1999; 9: 1259-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, inhibition of rho kinase can prevent intracellular ezrin threonine 567 phosphorylation (14Tran Quang C. Gautreau A. Arpin M. Treisman R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4565-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shaw R.J. Henry M. Solomon F. Jacks T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), whereas expression of activated rhoA can stimulate ezrin phosphorylation at threonine 567 (15Shaw R.J. Henry M. Solomon F. Jacks T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Consistent with a direct effect of rho kinase, recombinant radixin is phosphorylated in vitro by rho kinase at the homologous threonine residue (9Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Despite these data, rho can regulate ezrin phosphorylation via other mechanisms (16Kawano Y. Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Amano M. Nakamura T. Ito M. Matsumura F. Inagaki M. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1023-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 17Fukata Y. Kimura K. Oshiro N.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2569-2580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in Drosophila melanogaster, it is clear that the ERM protein moesin can regulate rho (19Speck O. Hughes S.C. Noren N.K. Kulikauskas R.M. Fehon R.G. Nature. 2003; 421: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), suggesting that rho and ERM proteins may regulate one another in a feedback fashion. Thus, although studied intensively, the role of rho in ezrin activation remains incompletely understood. More importantly, there are many examples in which PKCα, PKCθ, and rho kinase are clearly not involved in ezrin phosphorylation (18Yonemura S. Matsui T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2569-2580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases, the specific kinase responsible for ezrin phosphorylation remains unknown. NHE3, the apical Na+-H+ exchanger expressed in renal and intestinal epithelia, plays a crucial role in organismal Na+-absorption, acid-base homeostasis, and volume regulation. For example, NHE3 knockout mice suffer from mild diarrhea and are acidotic and hypotensive (20Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Miller M.L. Soleimani M. Gawenis L.R. Riddle T.M. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Wang T. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). NHE3 activity can be regulated by the actin cytoskeleton (21Kurashima K. D'Souza S. Szaszi K. Ramjeesingh R. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29843-29849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Szaszi K. Kurashima K. Kapus A. Paulsen A. Kaibuchi K. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3353-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although this may be caused in part by regulation of NHE3 at the plasma membrane, it is also clear that translocation of NHE3 to the plasma membrane contributes significantly to NHE3 up-regulation (24Lee-Kwon W. Kawano K. Choi J.W. Kim J.H. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16494-16501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P.

Although the mechanisms that regulate NHE3 translocation are incompletely understood, recent studies suggest that Akt may be involved in this process. For example, transfection of fibroblasts with constitutively active Akt increases surface NHE3 activity (26Lee-Kwon W. Johns D.C. Cha B. Cavet M. Park J. Tsichlis P. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31296-31304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although that study did not measure surface NHE3 in Akt-transfected cells (26Lee-Kwon W. Johns D.C. Cha B. Cavet M. Park J. Tsichlis P. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31296-31304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), NHE3 translocation and Akt activation both occur as a consequence of lysophosphatidic acid treatment (24Lee-Kwon W. Kawano K. Choi J.W. Kim J.H. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16494-16501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have shown that NHE3 activity is increased after the initiation of SGLT1-mediated Na+-glucose cotransport (27Turner J.R. Black E.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1533-C1541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may reflect a global signal to up-regulate enterocyte nutrient and ion transport upon the detection of nutrients, i.e. glucose, in the intestinal lumen. This increased NHE3 activity requires ezrin phosphorylation at threonine 567 and is at least partly the result of NHE3 exocytosis (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although both ezrin phosphorylation and NHE3 activation require p38 MAP kinase activation (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Turner J.R. Black E.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1533-C1541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we considered it unlikely that p38 MAP kinase could phosphorylate ezrin directly because the residues surrounding threonine 567 lack the proline residues typical of p38 MAP kinase substrates. The goal of these studies was to identify the kinase that phosphorylates ezrin, thereby triggering NHE3 exocytosis, after the initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport. We show here that Akt2-mediated ezrin phosphorylation is necessary for NHE3 translocation and activation after initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport. This is the first demonstration of Akt-mediated ezrin phosphorylation and suggests a complex functional association between these critical signaling molecules. Cell Culture and Stimulation of SGLT1-mediated Na+-Glucose Cotransport—SGLT1-expressing Caco-2 cells were maintained as described previously (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Turner J.R. Lencer W.I. Carlson S. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7738-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For experimental use, cells were grown as confluent monolayers (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For studies using dominant negative ezrin, Caco-2 cells stably transfected with VSVG tagged N-terminal (1–309) ezrin were used (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For these studies, Caco-2 cells stably transfected with VSVG-tagged wild-type ezrin were used as controls, as described previously (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Before initiation of SGLT1-mediated Na+-glucose cotransport, monolayers were pre-incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in nominally HCO3−-free HBSS with 25 mm mannose and 0.5 mm phloridzin, to inhibit Na+-glucose cotransport. When used, LY294002, PD169316, H-89, and NL-71-101 (Calbiochem) were included during this pre-incubation as well as all subsequent media before cell lysis. Na+-glucose cotransport was initiated by transfer to nominally HCO3−-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 25 mm glucose. At the times indicated in the figures, monolayers were scraped directly into 4 °C SDS-PAGE sample buffer and immediately boiled for 5 min before immunoblot analysis. In Silico Analysis of Kinases—Analysis of potential kinases that may phosphorylate ezrin at threonine 567 was performed using Scansite 2.0 (29Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). A 46-residue sequence, ARDENKRTHNDIIHNENMRQGRDKYKTLRQIRQGNTKQRIDEFEAL, composed of residues 541–586 of human ezrin, was input and scanned against all kinase groups at low stringency. Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, as described previously (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Ezrin and Akt phosphorylation were detected using polyclonal antisera against ezrin phosphorylated at threonine 567 and Akt phosphorylated at threonine 308 or serine 473 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Monoclonal 3C12 anti-total ezrin (Sigma) and polyclonal anti-total Akt (Cell Signaling Technology) were used to probe total levels of these proteins. Isoform-specific anti-Akt1, anti-Akt2, and anti-Akt3 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibody binding was detected with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) and chemiluminescence (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) on Eastman Kodak BioMax MR film. Signal intensity, corrected for background, was analyzed by densitometry using NIH ImageJ 1.29. For quantitative analysis of protein phosphorylation, paired aliquots of each sample were immunoblotted for phosphorylated or total protein and the ratio of these values was considered the phosphorylation state of that sample in arbitrary units. Experiments were performed in triplicate or greater. These values were grouped for statistical analysis. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Caco-2 monolayers were harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) after initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport. Lysates were pre-cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitated by incubation at 4 °C with Sepharose-conjugated monoclonal anti-Akt 1G1 antibody, which binds preferentially to Akt phosphorylated at serine 473 (Cell Signaling Technology) for 2.5 h. Beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2), and resuspended in kinase buffer supplemented with 70 μm ATP and 1 μg of recombinant-full-length GST-ezrin with or without pharmacological inhibitors, as indicated. After 30 min at 30 °C reactions were terminated by addition of 0.5 volumes of 3× SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for threonine 567 phosphorylated and total ezrin. siRNA Knockdown of Akt2 Expression—Caco-2 monolayers were transfected with either SignalSilence Akt2 siRNA duplexes or nonspecific control GC content-matched siRNA duplexes (Cell Signaling Technology). These siRNA duplexes are reported to inhibit expression of Akt2, but not Akt1 or Akt3. Our preliminary optimization studies showed that optimal protein knockdown occurred 4 days after transfection of 200 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At these times, immunoblot analyses showed that expression of Akt1 remained low but detectable, Akt3 remained undetectable, and expression of NHE3, ezrin, and actin were unaffected by siRNA treatment. Similar immunoblots were routinely used to verify specific Akt2 knockdown (i.e. knockdown of Akt2 without knockdown of Akt1, ezrin, NHE3, or actin) in all experiments. Immunofluorescent Detection of Surface NHE3—Surface NHE3 expression was performed as described previously (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In brief, Caco-2 monolayers were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed, blocked, and incubated with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antisera at 4 °C. After washing, bound anti-NHE3 antibodies were detected using Alexa-594 conjugated goat anti-rabbit antisera (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Total NHE3 detection was performed identically except for the inclusion of 0.05% saponin in wash and antibody incubation buffers. Stained monolayers were mounted in Slowfade (Molecular Probes), and images were collected using a 100× Plan Apo objective and a DMLB epifluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) equipped with an 88000 filter set (Chroma Technology Corp, Brattleboro, VT) and Coolsnap HQ camera (Roper Scientific, Duluth, GA) controlled by Metamorph 6 (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Post-acquisition analyses of mean pixel intensity was performed using Metamorph. In all image acquisition and analysis, identically timed exposures within a single experiment were used for quantitative comparisons, as described previously (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Measurement of pHi—Confluent monolayers were incubated in 25 mm mannose containing 3.5 μm of acetoxymethyl ester of 2′-7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 15 min. 2′-7′-bis(2-Carboxyethyl)-5(6)carboxyfluorescein-loaded cells were analyzed using a Model RC-M fluorometer (Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ). Fluorescence was measured at excitation wavelengths of 439 and 507 nm with emission at 535 nm, as described previously (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using Felix32 software (Photon Technology International). pHi responses were compared at 2 min after initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport, as described previously (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In Silico Analysis of Ezrin Threonine 567—To identify potential ezrin kinases in a non-biased manner, a 46-residue sequence composed of residues 541–586 of human ezrin was analyzed using Scansite 2.0 (29Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Scansite 2.0 analyzes more than 60 protein phosphorylation sequence motifs based on data obtained from peptide library and phage display phosphorylation studies (29Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Our low stringency analysis of this ezrin domain identified only three kinases, protein kinase A (PKA), PKCζ, and Akt, as potential ezrin threonine 567 kinases. Because PKA is a well known stimulus that inhibits NHE3 (30Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we did not consider it further. We also did not consider PKCζ further because it has not been previously implicated in either NHE3 regulation or ezrin phosphorylation, and the sequence recognition score reported by Scansite suggested that PKCζ was the least likely of these three potential ezrin kinases. It is noteworthy that although Akt has never been implicated in ezrin phosphorylation, it has been associated with NHE3 translocation. This prompted further investigation. Ezrin and Akt Activation Follow Initiation of Na+-Glucose Cotransport—To evaluate the potential role of Akt in ezrin phosphorylation, we first sought to determine whether Akt activation coincided with the ezrin phosphorylation that follows initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport. Akt activation was assessed as phosphorylation at the threonine 308 and serine 473 regulatory sites, which are known to correlate with Akt kinase activity (31Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Increased phosphorylation at both sites, indicating Akt activation, increased after initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport (p < 0.01; Fig. 1). This Akt phosphorylation occurred with kinetics that correlated closely with ezrin phosphorylation at threonine 567 (r = 0.99; Fig. 1). Although these data do not prove a causative association, they are consistent with a potential role for Akt in this process.Fig. 1Initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport results in increased ezrin phosphorylation at threonine 567 and a corresponding rise in Akt phosphorylation at both threonine 308 and serine 473. Monolayers were lysed at indicated times after initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport, and lysates were immunoblotted for threonine 567 phosphorylated ezrin, total ezrin, threonine 308 phosphorylated Akt, serine 473 phosphorylated Akt, and total Akt. Densitometric analysis of triplicate samples from this experiment are shown and represent the mean and S.D. of the ratios of threonine 567 phosphorylated ezrin to total ezrin (circles) and serine 473 phosphorylated Akt to total Akt (triangles). These ratios increased by 52 ± 3% and 231 ± 29%, respectively, at 240 s after initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport (p < 0.01). Increases in threonine 308 Akt phosphorylation were similar to serine 473 phosphorylation. Representative immunoblots are shown. Results are typical of at least three independent experiments, each with triplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have shown previously that p38 MAP kinase activation is required for ezrin phosphorylation at threonine 567 (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, to further explore the relationship between ezrin and Akt phosphorylation, we examined whether p38 MAP kinase activity was required for Akt phosphorylation, as it is for ezrin phosphorylation (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similar to its effect on ezrin phosphorylation, p38 MAP kinase inhibition prevented phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 2). Thus, phosphorylation of both Akt and ezrin seems to occur downstream of signaling events that include p38 MAP kinase activation. Na+-Glucose Cotransport-dependent Akt Activation Does Not Require Ezrin Function—The data above are consistent with the hypothesis that Akt directly phosphorylates ezrin at threonine 567. However, they are also consistent with the converse (i.e. that ezrin activation leads to downstream activation of Akt). The latter has been suggested based on defective Akt activation in kidney-derived epithelia expressing mutant and dominant-negative ezrin constructs (32Gautreau A. Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 33Wu K.L. Khan S. Lakhe-Reddy S. Jarad G. Mukherjee A. Obejero-Paz C.A. Konieczkowski M. Sedor J.R. Schelling J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26280-26286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We have shown that expression of a dominant-negative ezrin construct consisting of the amino-terminal 309 amino acids (Nter) completely inhibits NHE3 activation after initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport (25Zhao H. Shiue H. Palkon S. Wang Y. Cullinan P. Burkhardt J.K. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Turner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, we used cells expressing the Nter dominant-negative construct to ask whether ezrin function is required for Akt activation to occur. Akt phosphorylation occurred after initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport in control cells transfected with full-length wild-type ezrin (Fig. 3). Cells stably transfected with Nter ezrin demonstrated similar Akt phosphorylation after Na+-glucose cotransport (Fig. 3). Thus, the Akt phosphorylation that follows Na+-glucose cotransport does not require upstream ezrin activation. Akt Directly Phosphorylates Ezrin at Threonine 567—Although they support the hypothesis that Akt directly phosphorylates ezrin, the data above do not exclude activation of an intermediate kinase, downstream of Akt, that is directly responsible for ezrin phosphorylation. To assess whether Akt can directly phosphorylate ezrin, in vitro kinase assays were performed using immunopurified active Akt and recombinant ezrin. Active Akt was isolated from cells lysed after initiation of Na+-glucose cotransport using an immobilized monoclonal antibody that recognizes activated Akt. The activated Akt beads were then combined with recombinant GST-ezrin produced in bacteria. Akt catalyzed ezrin phosphorylation at threonine 567 (Fig. 4). This ezrin phosphorylation was strictly dependent on the presence of ATP. To pharmacologically confirm that the immunopurified Akt was responsible for the ezrin phosphorylation observed, two compounds known to inhibit Akt, H-89 NL-71-101 (34Murakami M. Kataoka K.

Spt6 is essential for viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and regulates chromatin structure during pol II transcription. Here we present evidence that mutations that impair Spt6, a second elongation factor, Spt4, and pol II can affect 3′-end formation at GAL10. Additional analysis suggests that Spt6 is required for cotranscriptional association of the factor Ctr9, a member of the Paf1 complex, with GAL10 and GAL7, and that Ctr9 association with chromatin 3′ of GAL10 is regulated by the GAL10 polyadenylation signal.

Additional roles for Spt6 in the transcription cycle probably also exist.The Paf1 complex is a multisubunit complex that associates with pol II and localizes to transcribed regions (14Squazzo S.L.

Although all of the roles of the Paf1 complex remain to be elucidated, recently, some complex members have been shown to be required for cotranscriptional ubiquitylation of histone H2B at position 123 (H2B Lys-123) and methylation of histone H3 lysines at positions 4 (Lys4), 36 (Lys36), and 79 (Lys79) (30Ng H.H.

Thus, the Paf1 complex appears to coordinate histone modifications with transcription. Mutations in genes encoding Paf1 complex members also exhibit a wide spectrum of genetic interactions with mutations in elongation factor genes such as SPT4, SPT5, SPT16, and POB3 (14Squazzo S.L. Costa P.J. Lindstrom D.L. Kumer K.E. Simic R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Arndt K.M. Hartzog G.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1764-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 35Costa P.J. Arndt K.M.

Many of these tasks are coordinated through the phosphorylation of the largest subunit of pol II on its conserved C-terminal domain, which in yeast consists of 26 repeats of consensus Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7 (reviewed in Refs. 2Howe K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 308Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and 37Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J.

Upon initiation of transcription, unphosphorylated pol II becomes phosphorylated on serine 5 of the C-terminal domain repeats, allowing recruitment of the mRNA capping machinery, and the nascent mRNA is capped as it emerges from the pol II complex. During elongation, serine 5 phosphorylation decreases and serine 2 becomes hyperphosphorylated (40Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine 2 has been implicated in recruitment and regulation of mRNA 3′-end formation factors as well as termination by pol II (41Skaar D.A. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1429-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 42Ahn S.H. Kim M. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In addition, elongating pol II has the ability to monitor transcript composition, because splicing and export factor recruitment can be enhanced by the presence of introns in a transcript (43Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, the pol II holoenzyme is dynamic, undergoing a characteristic sequence of reversible modifications and associating with a variety of accessory factors during the course of a single round of transcription.Following transcription of a DNA-encoded polyadenylation signal by pol II, the nascent RNA is cleaved and polyadenylated. Concurrent or subsequent to these events, pol II terminates transcription at a site downstream. The relationship between mRNA 3′-end formation and transcription termination is complex. Recent evidence shows that termination and cleavage may be uncoupled, although both require transcription of a polyadenylation signal (44Aranda A. Proudfoot N. Mol.

We present evidence that spt6 mutations, as well as spt4 mutations and mutations that impair pol II, can alter mRNA 3′-end formation at GAL10. In addition, our results show that both Spt6 and a member of the Paf1 complex, Ctr9, are cotranscriptionally recruited to GAL10-GAL7. However, whereas Spt6 is physically associated with the intergenic region 3′ of the GAL10 polyadenylation signal, Ctr9 levels are significantly lower in this region. Finally, our results suggest a functional interaction between Spt6 and Ctr9 based on both chromatin immunoprecipitation and genetic experiments. Taken together, these results suggest a reorganization of the pol II holoenzyme in response to 3′-end formation signals during transcription termination in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESS. cerevisiae Strains, Plasmids, and Media—All S. cerevisiae strains (Table I) are isogenic to a GAL2 derivative of S288C (48Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). DNA encoding a FLAG epitope was fused to the 5′-end of the SPT6 open reading frame in plasmid pCC11 (49Clark-Adams C.D. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), using standard techniques (50Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 51Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.E. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY1991Google Scholar). This SPT6-FLAG genomic fragment was then subcloned into pRS306 (52Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this plasmid, pCK40, was used to integrate SPT6-FLAG in place of SPT6, using a standard two-step gene replacement method. Thus, SPT6-FLAG is the sole source of Spt6 in strains with SPT6-FLAG. Strains with this fusion are wild type with respect to all spt6 mutant phenotypes tested, including growth, temperature sensitivity, and suppression of insertion mutations (data not shown). RPB3-HA1::LEU2 (53Kolodziej P.A. Woychik N. Liao S.M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was crossed from GHY645, a kind gift from G. Hartzog, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA. Plasmids made using PCR were verified by DNA sequencing. Sequence encoding nine copies of the MYC-epitope tag was amplified along with a kanMX4 cassette from pCK185 and integrated 3′ of CTR9, creating CTR9–9MYC::kanMX4. pCK185 is a kanMX4 derivative of pWZV87 (54Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) with a kanMX4 cassette replacing a BglII fragment of the Kluyveromyces lactis TRP1 gene. The genes encoding each of these epitope-tagged proteins are integrated into the genome, expressed from their natural promoter, and are the sole source of each particular protein in the cell. The epitope tags do not confer any apparent phenotypes to the wild type strain, and any differences between wild type and spt6–1004 are presumed to rest solely with the spt6–1004 mutation. A set of spt6 internal deletions were constructed by standard methods using PCR, subcloned into pCK40, and then used to replace genomic SPT6 as described above. spt6–1004 encodes a version of Spt6 lacking residues 931–994. For characterizing genetic interactions between SPT6 and PAF complex genes, spt6–1004, spt6–1006, and spt6–1002 were crossed to strains CKY87 (paf1Δ::kanMX4), CKY91 (cdc73Δ::kanMX4), or CKY95 (ctr9ΔkanMX4). The resulting diploids were transformed with pCK25 (SPT6-FLAG CEN URA3) so that, in case of double mutant inviability, double mutant spores would be complemented by SPT6 on the plasmid. After sporulation, at least 18 tetrads were analyzed from each cross. paf1Δ, cdc73Δ, and ctr9Δ were followed in the crosses by resistance to G418 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) conferred by the kanMX4 cassette. spt6 alleles were scored by strong suppression of lys2–128δ (growth on medium lacking lysine) after selection against pCK25 on 5-fluoroorotic acid plates. If a spore was 5-fluoroorotic acid-sensitive, the presence of spt6–1004 was inferred by segregation analysis. The gal7Δ6 mutation (constructed similarly as in Ref. 55Greger I.H. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4771-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was constructed using a QuikChange kit from Stratagene. The major polyadenylation signal of GAL10 was also deleted by this strategy, creating gal10Δ56, which is similar to gal10Δ55 (55Greger I.H. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4771-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). gal10Δ56 removes nucleotides from +74 through +128 downstream of the GAL10 stop codon and appears to create a cryptic polyadenylation signal at the deletion junction (data not shown). The gal10 and gal7 mutations were integrated into the genome by standard two-step gene replacement. For experiments involving GAL gene expression, strains were grown in YP (1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% peptone (Difco)) supplemented with 2% raffinose and 2% galactose for at least 8 h and harvested at a concentration of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml. For examination of the kinetics of GAL gene induction, cells were grown for at least 8 h in YP plus 2% raffinose and were then induced by the addition of 2% galactose. RNA was prepared from cells at the indicated times after induction. All other media were made as described previously (56Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P.

Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). For Western and ChIP analysis, antibodies used were: M2 (Sigma), mouse anti-FLAG IgG; 12CA5 (ascites, kind gift of E. Harlow, Harvard Medical School), mouse anti-HA IgG; and A14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-MYC. ChIP analysis was performed as described (57Larschan E. Winston F.

Cross-linking was then quenched by addition of 30 ml of 2.5 m glycine for 5 min. Cells were washed with TBS (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and disrupted with glass beads in lysis buffer. Cross-linked material was then washed twice with 1 ml of FA buffer (solution as described before (59Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) but with 300 mm NaCl, no SDS) and resuspended in 1 ml of FA buffer. Cross-linked material was solubilized by sonication to shear chromatin to ∼400-bp fragments. Sonication conditions were 2 × 20 s at setting 4, 4 × 20 s at setting 8, and 2–4 × 20 s at setting 10, as needed (Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator Model 50). Approximately 5–10% of this sonicated material and 2 μl of the appropriate antibody were incubated with rocking overnight at 4 °C. Immuno-chromatin complexes were isolated by addition of 50 μlof 1:1 slurry Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in FA buffer (no SDS) for 1–2 h at room temperature. Sepharose beads were washed as described, except FA buffer for the first two washes was 300 mm NaCl, no SDS, and FA buffer for the third wash was 500 mm NaCl. Chromatin was eluted in a single step elution by incubating beads with 50 μl of elution buffer (59Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) for 20 min at 65 °C. PCR conditions were as follows: 5 μl of diluted chromatin containing either 1% or 0.5% eluted material (IP) or 0.05% or 0.025% input chromatin (Input) was added to 10 μl of PCR mixture and amplified using standard conditions (94 °C 3 min followed by 26 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 5 min). Final concentrations of PCR reagents were: 200 μm dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences), 1× TaqPCR buffer (Invitrogen), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Me2SO, 0.067 unit/μl TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 0.033 μCi/μl [32P]dATP. Reactions were separated via 6% 29:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris-borate, 1 mm EDTA) (50Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Northern Blotting, RNA Isolation, and RT-PCR—RNA was isolated as described (60Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total RNA/lane was separated via formaldehyde/MOPS gels as previously described (61Swanson M.S. Malone E.A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For analysis of GAL10 and ACT1 transcripts, DNA fragments covering the GAL10 or ACT1 ORFs were amplified by PCR and radiolabeled via random priming with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, as described previously (51Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.E. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY1991Google Scholar). For analysis of GAL10-GAL7 fusion transcripts, a fragment of the GAL10-GAL7 intergenic region covering +137 to through +443 3′ from the GAL10 stop codon was amplified by PCR and cloned into pSP64 (Stratagene), creating pCK195. pCK195 was linearized with BamHI (Roche Applied Science) and was used as a template for in vitro transcription by SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) as directed by the manufacturer. This GAL10-GAL7 intergenic antisense RNA probe was radiolabeled during in vitro transcription and used in Northern analysis. Total RNA for RT-PCR was isolated as above and treated with RNase-free DNase to remove residual genomic DNA. Oligonucleotide primers for RT-PCR were kind gifts of Dr. Jerry Kaplan (University of Utah) and fit criteria for efficiency and primer-dimer formation specified in Ref. 62Kang J.J. Watson R.M.

For RT-PCR using oligo(dT)-primed cDNA, 5 μg of total RNA per reaction isolated as above were added to Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads (Amersham Biosciences), and cDNA was synthesized using oligonucleotide CKO99, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences of oligonucleotides are available upon request.RESULTSMutation of SPT6 Causes Reduced Read-through Transcription Past GAL10—Previous studies have shown that yeast mutants believed to have transcription elongation defects display delayed and decreased induction of highly transcribed genes, including the GAL1, -7, and -10 genes (63Wind-Rotolo M.

In these experiments, we used the mutation spt6–1004, which contains an internal deletion of the sequence encoding the helix-hairpin-helix motif of Spt6 (under “Experimental Procedures”) (67Doherty A.J. Serpell L.C. Ponting C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2488-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar)). Strains containing this mutation are temperature-sensitive for growth at 37 °C and have a strong Spt– phenotype at the permissive temperature (30 °C). 2C. D. Kaplan and F. Winston, unpublished observation. Northern analysis (Fig. 1) showed that, compared with a wild-type strain, the spt6–1004 mutant has slower induction kinetics for GAL10 mRNA and modestly lower steady-state levels of GAL10 (∼40–50% of wild type) (Fig. 1) when cells are grown at permissive temperature (30 °C). Thus, an spt6 mutation causes defects similar to what has been previously observed for other putative elongation mutants (63Wind-Rotolo M. Reines D. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2009038548,"C2 domains are primarily found in signal transduction proteins such as protein kinase C, which generally contain a single C2 domain, and in membrane trafficking proteins such as synaptotagmins, which generally contain multiple C2 domains. In both classes of proteins, C2 domains usually regulate the respective protein's function by forming Ca2+-dependent or Ca2+-independent phospholipid complexes. We now describe MCTPs (multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins), a novel family of evolutionarily conserved C2 domain proteins with unusual Ca2+-dependent properties. MCTPs are composed of a variable N-terminal sequence, three C2 domains, two transmembrane regions, and a short C-terminal sequence. The invertebrate organisms Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster express a single MCTP gene, whereas vertebrates express two MCTP genes (MCTP1 and MCTP2) whose primary transcripts are extensively alternatively spliced. Most of the MCTP sequences, in particular the C2 domains, are highly conserved. All MCTP C2 domains except for the second C2 domain of MCTP2 include a perfect Ca2+/phospholipid-binding consensus sequence. To determine whether the C2 domains of MCTPs actually function as Ca2+/phospholipid-binding modules, we analyzed their Ca2+ and phospholipid binding properties. Surprisingly, we found that none of the three MCTP1 C2 domains interacted with negatively charged or neutral phospholipids in the presence or absence of Ca2+. However, Ca2+ titrations monitored via intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence revealed that all three C2 domains bound Ca2+ in the absence of phospholipids with a high apparent affinity (EC50 of ∼1.3-2.3 μm). Our data thus reveal that MCTPs are evolutionarily conserved C2 domain proteins that are unusual in that the C2 domains are anchored in the membrane by two closely spaced transmembrane regions and represent Ca2+-binding but not phospholipid-binding modules.

Our data thus reveal that MCTPs are evolutionarily conserved C2 domain proteins that are unusual in that the C2 domains are anchored in the membrane by two closely spaced transmembrane regions and represent Ca2+-binding but not phospholipid-binding modules. The C2 domain is defined as a sequence motif in a comparison of the primary structures of different protein kinase C isoforms and named in an unbiased fashion as the “second constant sequence” of protein kinase C isozymes (1Coussens L. Parker P.J. Rhee L. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen E. Waterfield M.D. Francke U. Ullrich A. Science. 1986; 233: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Later studies revealed that a large number of proteins include C2 domains, with >200 such proteins in the human genome alone (2International Human Genome Sequence, ConsortiumNature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17336) Google Scholar). We observed that in synaptotagmin 1, a synaptic vesicle protein that binds Ca2+ and contains two C2 domains (3Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), C2 domains are autonomously folded Ca2+-binding modules (4Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Subsequently, most C2 domain proteins were found to form Ca2+-dependent phospholipid complexes, although some appear to bind to phospholipids in the absence of Ca2+ (e.g. PTEN) (6Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Cristofano DiA. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) and others constitute protein-interaction domains instead of binding to either Ca2+ or phospholipids (e.g. the N-terminal C2 domain of Munc13-1 (7Betz A.

Neuron. 2001; 30: 183-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) or the C-terminal RIM1α C2 domain (8Schoch S. Castillo P.E. Jo T. Mukherjee K. Geppert M. Wang Y. Schmitz F. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar)). Although the Ca2+-binding properties of many C2 domain proteins remain to be examined, the large number of C2 domain proteins in the vertebrate genome makes it likely that this domain represents the second most common Ca2+ binding motif after the EF-hand motif. Most C2 domain proteins are either signal transduction enzymes, such as protein kinase C, or membrane trafficking proteins, such as synaptotagmin 1. At least some isoforms of all major signal transduction enzymes, from ubiquitin ligases to kinases to various phospholipases, contain a C2 domain. Without exception, these proteins are soluble cytosolic enzymes that include a single C2 domain. In contrast, membrane trafficking proteins generally include at least two C2 domains, although a few proteins such as the γ-RIM isoforms (9Wang Y. Südhof T.C. Genomics. 2003; 81: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and some splice variants of piccolo/aczonin and intersectin (10Wang X. Kibschull M. Laue M.M. Lichte B. Petrasch-Parwez E.

Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1521: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) contain only a single C2 domain. In membrane trafficking proteins the different C2 domains often feature conserved sequence differences, indicating that the C2 domains are functionally specialized. For example, although in synaptotagmin 1 the C2A and C2B domains both bind Ca2+ and phospholipids with similar affinities (13Sugita S. Shin O-H. Han W. Lao Y. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), the C2B domain contains an additional “bottom” α-helix that is absent from the C2A domain but is conserved in all of the C2B domains of synaptotagmins (14Fernandez I. Arac D. Ubach J. Gerber S.H. Shin O-H. Gao Y. Anderson R.G.W. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1057-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Membrane trafficking proteins with multiple C2 domains either have no TMR 1The abbreviations used are: TMR, transmembrane region; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MCTP, multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region protein.1The abbreviations used are: TMR, transmembrane region; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MCTP, multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region protein. or a single TMR either at the N terminus (e.g. synaptotagmins; see Fig. 1) (15Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) or the C terminus (e.g. ferlins) (16Bansal D. Campbell K.P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 206-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Work over the last few decades established Ca2+ as the major intracellular second messenger in eukaryotic cells, with specificity achieved by the spatial segregation of Ca2+ signals. In vertebrate genomes, proteins containing EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites are more common than C2 domain proteins (2International Human Genome Sequence, ConsortiumNature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17336) Google Scholar). However, Ca2+ binding in EF-hand proteins often does not serve a direct regulatory function but instead acts in Ca2+ buffering (e.g. parvalbumin and calbindin) or subserves a structural role (reviewed in Refs. 17Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar and 18Nakayama N. Kawasaki H. Kretsinger R. Top. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 3: 29-58Google Scholar). Among the EF-hand proteins with a regulatory Ca2+-binding site, one particular protein, calmodulin, appears to mediate more Ca2+-dependent regulatory actions than all other EF-hand proteins combined and is in fact expressed as an identical sequence from multiple independent genes (reviewed in Refs. 19Toutenhoofd S.L. Strehler E.E. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and 20Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). This situation seems to be completely different for C2 domain proteins. All functionally characterized proteins containing a C2 domain that binds Ca2+ also act as Ca2+ sensors, and no single C2 domain protein dominates the Ca2+-dependent regulation of a cell. Thus, to fully understand the targets of Ca2+-signaling in cells it is essential to characterize all principal C2 domain proteins. Only a complete overview of the Ca2+-dependent properties of different C2 domain proteins will provide insight into how Ca2+ signaling works. In view of these considerations, we have searched for conserved C2 domain proteins that might function as widely distributed Ca2+ sensors and have focused on membrane-anchored C2 domain proteins because these are most likely involved in membrane traffic. Sequence Analyses and Data Bank Searches—Various data banks of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and Celera Genomics were searched for multiple C2 domain proteins, expressed sequence tags, splice variants in reported full-length sequences, and the genes of MCTPs using programs available on the NCBI web site with default settings. The MCTP cDNA sequences were submitted to GenBank™ (accession numbers AY656715, AY656716, and AY656717). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The DNAs encoding the human MCTP1L-C2A (residues 243-391), MCTP1L-C2B (residues 451-598), MCTP1L-C2C (residue 608-755), and MCTP2-C2C (residues 491-638) domains were PCR amplified, subcloned into pGEX-KG vector, and verified by DNA sequencing. All recombinant proteins were produced as bacterial GST fusion proteins, purified essentially as described (21Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar), additionally treated with Benzonase, and washed with 20 mm CaCl2 and high salt buffers to remove the bacterial contaminants that stick to C2 domains and alter their properties (22Ubach J. Lao Y. Fernandez I. Arac D. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5854-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Construction and Expression of Vectors Encoding Various EYFP Fusion Proteins of MCTP2 Fragments to Test the Functionality of Putative Transmembrane Regions—pCMV-EYFP, pCMV-EYFP-MCTP-TM1 (MCTP2 residue 641-750; does not correspond to a physiological splice variant), pCMV-EYFP-MCTP-TM2 (MCTP2 residue 641-878 with residue 696-736 deletion; junction sequence: STLRSTIAFA-deleted sequence-ESTDIDDEEDE, precisely corresponding to a splice variant observed in random cDNA sequences in GenBank™; see Fig. 2B), and pCMV-EYFP-MCTP-TM1-TM2 (MCTP2 residue 641-878) were generated by standard procedures and transfected into COS-7 cells using DEAE-dextran. After 2 days, cells were washed three times using phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.5 ml of buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm sodium EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Diagnostics) was added to each 100-mm plate. Scraped cells were passed through the 27-gauge, 0.5-inch needle (BD Biosciences) five times, and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to precipitate unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was additionally centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and total membrane and cytosol fractions were separated. All fractions were adjusted to the same volume, and Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against GFP (T3743) was performed. Centrifugation phospholipid binding assays were carried out with purified soluble GST fusion proteins in buffer A (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 6.8, 0.1 m NaCl, and 4 mm sodium EGTA). The C2 domain GST fusion proteins were incubated with liposomes of defined phospholipid composition in buffer A containing variable amounts of CaCl2, SrCl2, or BaCl2 to provide defined concentrations of free Ca2+, Sr2+, or Ba2+, respectively (calculated using EqCal for Windows software from Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). For liposome generation, dried phospholipids (obtained from Avanti Co.) were resuspended in buffer A containing 0.5 m sucrose and sonicated. The resulting “heavy” liposomes were then isolated by centrifugation. After the incubations of C2 domains with liposomes, liposomes with bound C2 domains were re-isolated by centrifugation essentially as described (14Fernandez I. Arac D. Ubach J. Gerber S.H. Shin O-H.

Neurosci. 2002; 5: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and bound proteins were precipitated, resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Purified GST-C2 domain proteins (3 mg in 1 ml of buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm sodium EGTA)) were cleaved with 10 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) and reconstituted in buffer B by rotation for 18 h at room temperature, and complete cleavage was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. GST-protein was removed by three sequential incubations with 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the absence of GST was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. C2 domain proteins without GST were used without further purification for recordings of fluorescence spectra after ∼1:1,000 dilution using buffer B. Fluorescence emission spectra were acquired in an LS55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an excitation wavelength of 282 nm. For Ca2+ titrations, aliquots of Ca2+ were added to the cuvette from a concentrated stock solution, and fluorescence was monitored at the stated emission maximum wavelengths. The concentration of free Ca2+ was calculated with the EqCal program, and the data were analyzed using GraphPad software. Reversibility of the Ca2+-induced increases in tryptophan fluorescence was tested by the addition of an excess of EGTA. Antibody Production—Polyclonal antibodies to human MCTPs were generated using the recombinant proteins U5837 (MCTP1L residues 243-391), U5987 (MCTP1L residues 608-755), U6380 (MCTP2 residues 1-324), and U5985 (MCTP2 residues 491-638). All proteins were initially produced as GST fusion proteins, but the GST moiety was removed by thrombin cleavage before the proteins were employed as antigens for antibody production. Cell Culture and Confocal Imaging—HEK293 cells were plated on polylysine-coated (1 mg/ml in 0.1 m borate buffer; Sigma) 18-mm diameter, 1.5 coverglasses (VWR Scientific), and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. One day after plating, cells were transfected with the EYFP-MCTP2 fusion vectors using FuGENE-6 (Roche Applied Science). Two days after transfection, cover glasses with cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μm FM5-95 (Molecular Probes) for 5 min on ice, and then mounted in an imaging chamber (Warner Instruments) for observation. Confocal images were acquired on a Leica TCS2 laser-scanning confocal microscope using a 100× oil objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.3). Cracked PC12 cell secretion assays were carried out with freeze-thaw permeabilization of PC 12 cells (13Sugita S. Shin O-H. Han W. Lao Y. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 23Shin O-H. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 70% confluent PC12 cells were loaded with [3H]norepinephrine for 24 h, washed with physiological saline (145 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4), harvested by pipetting a stream of Ca2+-free ice-cold buffer C (120 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EGTA, and 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2), and washed twice with same buffer. Cell “ghosts” were prepared by freezing cells overnight at -80 °C, thawing on ice for 2 h, and washing the ghosts 3× with 6 ml of buffer C containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Standard secretion reactions (∼20 reactions per 100-mm plate; 0.1 ml of total volume in 1.5-ml tubes) contained washed cell ghosts, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μl of rat brain cytosol (10 g/liter) in buffer C, and 6 μm of recombinant C2 domain protein with various concentrations of Ca2+ to obtain the indicated free concentrations (calculated by EqCal). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated on ice, and the samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 3 min at 20,800 × g. Supernatants and pellets solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Miscellaneous Procedure—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed using standard procedures (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar, 25Johnston P.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1268-1273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Characterization of MCTP Sequences—In searching for proteins containing C2 domains and transmembrane regions, we identified four classes of evolutionarily conserved proteins as follows: (i) synaptotagmins, which are expressed in at least 15 isoforms and are defined by the presence of a single N-terminal TMR and two C-terminal C2 domains with characteristic sequence motifs (reviewed in Ref. 15Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar); (ii) ferlins, which contain 3-6 C2 domains and a C-terminal TMR (reviewed in Ref. 16Bansal D. Campbell K.P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 206-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar); and (iii) two novel protein families that comprise 3-6 C2 domains with either N- or C-terminal TMRs (see schematic drawing in Fig. 1). We refer to the proteins containing an N-terminal TMR and multiple cytoplasmic C2 domains as E-Syts (for “extended synaptotagmins”), because the topology of these proteins resembles that of synaptotagmins. One member of the E-Syt family was described previously as an unnamed plasma membrane protein of adipocytes (26Morris N.J. Ross S.A. Neveu J.M. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); these proteins will be examined in a later study. The present report will focus on the second class of novel C2 domain proteins, namely the proteins referred to here as MCTPs (for multiple C2 domain and TMR proteins”), because at least some splice variants of these proteins contain multiple TMRs in addition to the C2 domains (Fig. 1). We focused on MCTPs because RNA interference experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans revealed that the C. elegans MCTP homolog (1H206) is an essential gene whose ablation leads to early embryonic lethality (27Maeda I. Kohara Y. Yamamoto M. Sugimoto A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 171-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), and we undertook a molecular characterization of MCTPs as a first step toward understanding their essential functions. We assembled full-length sequences and cDNA clones for human MCTPs using commercially available expressed sequence tag clones and PCR on human cDNA. Data bank searches revealed that all vertebrates contain two MCTP genes with the same overall architecture and a high degree of sequence identity, whereas invertebrate animals (C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) contain a single MCTP gene. For comparison of MCTPs, we aligned the human MCTP1 and MCTP2 and the Drosophila and C. elegans MCTP sequences (Fig. 2A). The Drosophila sequences were assembled from two separate predicted transcription units in the data bank (CG33148 and CG33146). Although Drosophila MCTP is predicted from the genome sequence to represent two separate genes, the precise colinearity of the Drosophila sequence with the human and C. elegans sequences (Fig. 2A) and the corresponding Anopheles gambiae sequence (data not shown) indicates that this represents a single transcription unit. The sequence alignments show that the N termini of MCTPs are highly variable; furthermore, both human MCTP1 and C. elegans MCTP are expressed with two alternative 5′-sequences (referred to as MCTP1L and MCTP1S and as MCTPL and MCTPS, respectively), possibly because the genes contain two independent promoters. Motif searches demonstrated that all MCTPs contain three C2 domains (referred to as C2A, C2B, and C2C domains; shown in red in Fig. 2A) followed by two transmembrane regions (shown in gray). Only short linkers separate the three C2 domains, whereas a longer region connects the C2 domains to the TMRs (presumptive cytoplasmic non-C2 domain sequences are shown in yellow in Fig. 2A). The sequence that connects the two TMRs is short and highly charged. All of the MCTP sequences except for the N-terminal region are highly conserved, with the highest degree of conservation of MCTPs being in the C2C domain, the second TMR, and the short C-terminal cytoplasmic sequence. The latter includes a 12-residue stretch that is identical in all species and isoforms (NNELLDFLSRVP; Fig. 2A). MCTPs Contain Two Functional TMRs—The proposed transmembrane topography for MCTPs (Fig. 1) is based on the absence of an N-terminal signal peptide in the MCTP sequences and the fact that all known C2 domains are cytoplasmic. With this topography, MCTPs are the only C2 domain proteins that include more than one TMR. Interestingly, analysis of the MCTP sequences from expressed sequence tags reveals evidence of at least two sites of alternative splicing. First, the linker that separates the C2A and C2B domain varies in size dependent on alternative splicing. Second, we observed in multiple independent clones alternative splicing of the first TMR (Fig. 2B). As a result of this alternative splicing, some mRNAs for both MCTP1 and MCTP2 only encode the second TMR. If correct, this alternative splicing would convert the conserved C-terminal cytoplasmic sequence of MCTPs into a non-cytoplasmic sequence, i.e. turn the topography of the C terminus around (Fig. 1). Although the predicted TMRs of MCTPs have all the features of classical TMRs, including a high degree of hydrophobicity, prediction of TMRs is not always accurate. To test whether each TMR is individually capable of anchoring MCTPs into a membrane, we generated constructs that encode EYFP fusion proteins of MCTP2 (Fig. 3). In these proteins, EYFP is fused to the C-terminal part of MCTP2 containing either both TMRs or only the first or second TMR. Of these proteins, the one carrying a deletion of the first TMR corresponded precisely to the sequence of the expressed sequence tag clones containing alternatively spliced MCTP variants that lack the first TMR (see Fig. 2B). We first transfected the EYFP-MCTP2 fusion constructs into COS cells and examined whether the presence of either TMR would render the protein particulate as expected for a TMR protein (Fig. 3). Indeed, we found that EYFP itself was soluble, but when fused to MCTP2 fragments containing either one of the two TMRs it became particulate. We next examined the localization of the transfected EYFP-MCTP2 fusion proteins in transfected HEK293 cells. All three proteins were localized to intracellular vesicular structures, suggesting that each TMR by itself is competent to anchor the protein to membranes and indicating that MCTP2 may normally be a vesicular protein (Fig. 4).Fig. 2Structure of MCTPs.A, primary amino acid sequences of human MCTP1 and MCTP2 (hMCTP1 and hMCTP2), Drosophila MCTP (DmMCTP), and C. elegans MCTP (CeMCTP).

Jet power, when compared with unbeamed radiation, increases with energy. The thermal component is generally overwhelmed by the nonthermal radiation, by a factor of 1.2 to 3 in the 2- to 10-keV range and up to a factor of 7 above 20 keV.

To characterize the voltage sensor movement associated with hERG activation and inactivation, we performed an Ala scan of the 32 amino acids (Gly514-Tyr545) that comprise the S4 domain and the flanking S3–S4 and S4–S5 linkers. Gating and ionic currents of wild-type and mutant channels were measured using cut-open oocyte Vaseline gap and two microelectrode voltage clamp techniques to determine the voltage dependence of charge movement, activation, and inactivation. Mapping the position of the charge-perturbing mutations (defined as |ΔΔG| > 1.0 kcal/mol) on a three-dimensional S4 homology model revealed a spiral pattern. As expected, mutation of these residues also altered activation. However, mutation of residues in the S3–S4 and S4–S5 linkers and the C-terminal end of S4 perturbed activation (|ΔΔG| > 1.0 kcal/mol) without altering charge movement, suggesting that the native residues in these regions couple S4 movement to the opening of the activation gate or stabilize the open or closed state of the channel. Finally, mutation of a distinct set of residues impacted inactivation and mapped to a single face of the S4 helix that was devoid of activation-perturbing residues.

In the heart, hERG channels conduct the rapidly activating, delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr (3Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar, 4Trudeau M. Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Robertson G.A. Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Unlike most voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels, the fully activated current-voltage relationship of hERG channels exhibits inward rectification, a property that limits efflux of K+ during the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential.Inward rectification of hERG channels results from a rapid and voltage-dependent C-type inactivation that proceeds at a rate much faster than activation. At membrane potentials between -20 and +20 mV, channels activate over hundreds of milliseconds but inactivate in milliseconds (5Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 6Schonherr R. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 7Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of hERG inactivation is shifted nearly -65 mV relative to channel activation (V0.5INACT = -85 mV, V0.5ACT = -20 mV). A single mutation (S631A) in the P-loop of the outer pore causes a +100 mV shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation, but no shift in activation compared with wild-type (WT) channels (6Schonherr R. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 8Zou A. Xu Q.P. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. 1998; 509: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, external cations have differential effects on the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation (9Johnson Jr., J.P. Balser J.R. Bennett P.B. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2534-2541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Johnson J.P. Mullins F.M. Bennett P.B. J. Gen.

Together, these findings led to the suggestion that distinct voltage-sensing mechanisms underlie activation and inactivation gating in hERG channels.The highly charged S4 transmembrane helix functions as the primary voltage sensor in voltage-gated channels. Neutralization of basic S4 residues shifts the voltage dependence of Shaker channel activation (12Papazian D.M. Timple L.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Moreover, hydrophobic residues surrounding the charged S4 residues are also important in voltage sensing (16Li-Smerin Y. Hackos D.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 17Schonherr R. Mannuzzu L.M. Isacoff E.Y. Heinemann S.H.

Although controversy exists regarding the specific details of how the S4 helix responds to changes in membrane potential, the bulk of evidence indicates that its physical movement generates gating currents that precede channel opening or closing (20Cha A.

Physiol. 2002; 119: 275-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and by measurement of gating currents (25Piper D.R. Varghese A. Sanguinetti M.C. Tristani-Firouzi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10534-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Both studies revealed fast and slow components that differed nearly 100-fold in their kinetics. The majority of the gating charge displacement was slow and associated with channel activation. The fast gating component, although kinetically similar to inactivation, had a midpoint nearly 100 mV more positive than the midpoint of hERG inactivation (24Smith P.L. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 275-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Piper D.R. Varghese A. Sanguinetti M.C. Tristani-Firouzi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10534-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and likely represents early independent transitions in the activation pathway.What determines the voltage sensitivity of fast inactivation? To address this question, we measured gating currents from the inactivation-deficient S631A hERG channel. Despite dramatic differences in inactivation, we did not detect any difference in gating currents between WT and S631A hERG channels (25Piper D.R. Varghese A. Sanguinetti M.C. Tristani-Firouzi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10534-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, no differences in fluorescence were detected between WT hERG and a channel with two mutations (G628C/S631C) in the P-loop that completely removed inactivation (24Smith P.L. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 275-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that mutations in the outer pore uncouple voltage sensor movement from the final rearrangements in the pore domain that close the inactivation gate.To further characterize the voltage sensor movement associated with hERG activation and inactivation, we performed an Ala scan of the S4 domain and the flanking S3–S4 and S4–S5 linkers to test the hypothesis that individual substitutions might differentially alter the equilibrium between the resting and activated states of the voltage sensor, the closed and open activation gate, or the open and inactivated pore. Here we report that Ala substitutions that perturbed charge movement localized to a spiral thread along the S4 helix. Mutations that perturbed activation were scattered throughout the scanned region, with the exception of one helical face of S4. Mutations that perturbed inactivation localized to the helical face of S4 that was devoid of activation-perturbing residues. Taken together, these results suggest that the hERG S4 acts as a voltage sensor for activation and inactivation but that distinct regions of S4 contribute differentially to each process, likely through specific and state-dependent inter-domain contacts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology and Oocyte Injection—Site-directed mutagenesis (26Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) of hERG, in vitro synthesis of cRNA, isolation and injection of Xenopus laevis oocytes were performed as previously described (27Goldin A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Stuehmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 2 ng of cRNA to record ionic current or 15 ng cRNA to record gating currents. Injected oocytes were incubated at 17–19 °C for 2–4 days before use in voltage clamp experiments.Electrophysiology—To estimate activation parameters, ionic currents were measured with a TEV-200 amplifier (Dagan Corp.) using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique (28Stuehmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Currents were filtered at 1 kHz with an eight-pole Bessel filter and then digitized at 2 kHz. To estimate charge movement and inactivation parameters, gating and ionic currents were measured with a CA-1B amplifier (Dagan Corp.) using the cut-open Vaseline gap (COVG) voltage clamp technique (29Stefani E. Bezanilla F. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 300-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Currents were filtered at 5 kHz with an eight-pole Bessel filter, and then digitized at 20 kHz. Voltage commands were generated with a personal computer using pCLAMP8 software and a DigiData 1322 analog to digital interface (Axon Instruments).Microelectrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubes (WPI) to obtain resistances of 0.7–2.0 MΩ for use in two-microelectrode voltage clamp and 0.1–0.5 MΩ for use in COVG when filled with 3 m KCl. All recordings were performed at 22–24 °C. For two-microelectrode voltage clamp recordings, the extracellular solution contained (in mm): 96 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.6. The recording chamber was perfused at a rate of ∼1 ml/min. The same extracellular solution was used for the top and guard chambers in COVG recordings. The intracellular solution in the bottom COVG chamber contained (in mm): 120 K-glutamate, 10 HEPES, pH 7.0. For gating current recordings, the extracellular solution consisted of (in mm): 120 tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 120 MES, 2 Ca-MES, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The intracellular solution contained (in mm) 120 tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 120 MES, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except MK-499, which was a gift from Merck & Co.For COVG recordings, the oocyte was permeabilized by adding 0.1–0.3% saponin in 120 potassium glutamate, 10 HEPES (pH 7.0) to the lower chamber for 2 min. For gating current measurements, intracellular K+ was reduced by clamping the membrane to -10 mV for 20–30 min. To eliminate hERG ionic currents, the specific blocker MK-499 (50 μm) (30Lynch Jr., J.J. Wallace A.A. Stupienski 3rd, R.F. Baskin E.P. Beare C.M. Appleby S.D. Salata J.J. Jurkiewicz N.K. Sanguinetti M.C. Stein R.B. et al.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 269: 541-554PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the external and internal solutions after depletion of intracellular K+. MK-499 did not appreciably alter the properties of hERG gating current (25Piper D.R. Varghese A. Sanguinetti M.C. Tristani-Firouzi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10534-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but was required to effectively eliminate residual ionic current during prolonged step depolarizations. Linear leak and capacitance currents were compensated by analog circuitry and subtracted on-line using a p/-8 protocol (31Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) from a holding potential (HP) of -110 mV. Nonlinear transient currents were not detected in uninjected oocytes under these conditions, indicating that gating currents detected in hERG cRNA-injected oocytes were not contaminated by constitutively expressed channels.Data Analysis and Calculation of Free Energy Parameters—The impact of individual residues on charge movement, activation, and inactivation was assessed in relative isolation by performing a systematic Ala scan of the S4 helix and the S3–S4 and S4–S5 linkers (Gly516-Tyr545). To quantify the energetic perturbation produced by the individual mutations, we calculated the free energy difference (ΔG) of three gating transitions in WT channels and compared these values to the energy difference induced by Ala substitution. The difference in ΔG between WT and mutant channels (ΔΔG) reflects the perturbation in a gating transition produced by the Ala substitution. Inherent in this analysis is the assumption that gating transitions can be simplified as two state transitions (e.g. closed to open). We examined the effect of Ala substitutions on three simplified equilibrium distributions reflecting the resting and activated voltage sensor, the closed and open activation gate, and the closed and open inactivation gate.To determine the equilibrium distribution associated with the resting and activated voltage sensor, intramembrane charge (Q) displacement was calculated by integrating the off-gating current (IgOFF) at HP = -110 mV elicited after 300-ms depolarizing step changes in membrane voltage (-100 to +40 mV, 10-mV increments). The more negative Q-V relationship for D540A hERG channels necessitated a HP of -140 mV. Normalized values of Q (Qrel) were plotted versus test potential and the relationship fitted to a Boltzmann function, Equation 1, Qrel=Q/Qmax=1/[1+exp(−zF/RT(Vt−V0.5))](Eq. 1) where Qmax is the maximum charge moved, Vt is the test potential, V0.5 is the voltage required to elicit 0.5*Qmax, z is the effective valence, F is Faraday's constant, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is temperature in degrees Kelvin.To determine the closed-open channel equilibrium, the relative conductance-voltage (grel-V) relationship was determined by an analysis of deactivating ionic currents at -70 mV. Peak values were estimated by fitting deactivating currents to a bi-exponential function and extrapolating back to the moment of repolarization. The fraction of maximal current activated by the depolarizing step (I/Imax) was determined and used to construct the grel-V relationships.The open-inactivated equilibrium (Iinact-V) was determined using a three-pulse protocol (5Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). First, hERG channels were activated and inactivated by a 300-ms pulse (Vpre) to +40 mV, then channels were recovered from inactivation by a 10-ms hyperpolarizing interpulse (Vinter) that was varied from -120 to +40 mV. Finally, the magnitude of the recovered currents was determined by a third test pulse (Vtest = +40 mV). For R531A mutant channels, Vpre and Vtest was +100 mV, because the V0.5 for activation was shifted to depolarized potentials. Iinact-V and grel-V curves were fitted with Boltzmann functions to estimate V0.5 and z.V0.5 and z values were used to estimate the ΔG between the resting and activated voltage sensor, the closed and open activation gate, and the closed and open inactivation gate for WT and each mutation by Equations 2 and 3 as follows. ΔG=z*V0.5*F(Eq. 2) S.E. of ΔG=ΔG*(zS.E./z)2−(V0.5S.E./V0.5)2(Eq. 3) Perturbations in the ΔG (ΔΔG) were estimated for each mutation by Equations 4 and 5. ΔΔG=ΔGMUT−ΔGWT=zMUT*V0.5MUT*F−zWT*V0.5WT*F(Eq. 4) S.E. of ΔΔG=(ΔGS.E. WT)2+(ΔGS.E. MUT)2(Eq. 5) Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = number of oocytes). Data plots, Boltzmann fits, ΔΔG calculations, and histogram analyses were performed with Origin 7.0 (OriginLabs Corp.) and Excel (Microsoft). The absolute ΔΔG values were clustered using average linkage of Euclidean distances with Cluster (www.lohninger.com).Linear color scales were constructed from the estimated perturbations (|ΔΔG|) for charge movement, activation, and inactivation. For a given equilibrium distribution, its representative color was set to maximal and the remaining colors were reduced linearly with respect to |ΔΔG|. For example, for the ΔΔG for activation, green was set to 239 while red and blue were reduced according to the magnitude of perturbation using Equations 6 and 7, [R,G,B]=[(239−x),239,(239−x)](Eq. 6) x=239−|ΔΔGgrel-V|/Scale Factor(Eq. 7) where ScaleFactor = 2 (charge movement), 2 (activation), and 1 (inactivation).An arbitrary scale factor was used to provide the most dynamic range of color possible for a given distribution, and a helical surface representation of S4 was colored according to the [R, G, B] values for each residue.Alignments and Structural Homology Models—An alignment of the Shaker, EAG (ether-a'-go-go), KvAP, and hERG channels was constructed using ClustalW (32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55173) Google Scholar) with minor manual adjustments. The S4 homology model was based on the KvAP S1–S4 crystal structure (33Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). A homology model of a single hERG subunit was based on a model of the Shaker channel (34Laine M. Lin M.C. Bannister J.P.

Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10374) Google Scholar), and images were constructed with DeepView (36Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

Also shown is an alignment with the homologous regions of EAG, Shaker, Kv2.1, and KvAP channels. Thirty-two residues (Gly514-Tyr545), including the S3–S4 linker through the S4–S5 linker, were mutated to Ala. Two mutant channels (K525A and L529A) did not express sufficiently to allow measurement of ionic or gating currents and were excluded from further study. Four other mutant channels did not express at levels high enough to permit gating current recordings (G514A, G516A, A527V, and R528A), but none of these perturbed the grel-V relationship (Tables I and II).Table ICharge movement parameters for hERG channels derived from Qrel-V relationships fitted with Boltzmann functionsMutationV0.5zΔGnmVe0kcal/molWT-21.9 ± 1.92.22 ± 0.10-1.13 ± 0.118G514A-25.4, -30.81.77, 1.91-1.04, -1.362S515A-15.7, -11.01.69, 1.88-0.61, -0.482G516ALEaLE, low expression (insufficient for gating current measurement)S517A-13.8, -16.31.68, 1.96-0.53, -0.742E518A-23.2 ± 2.02.50 ± 0.37-1.35 ± 0.234E519A-10.6, -12.71.87, 2.17-0.46, -0.642L520A-37.7, -40.62.19, 1.68-1.91, -1.582I521A-33.6, -19.71.98, 1.89-1.54, -0.862G522ALEL523A-27.6 ± 0.62.78 ± 0.51-1.78 ± 0.333L524A-2.2, 8.11.58, 1.57-0.08, 0.292K525ANEbNE, no expressionT526A-27.8 ± 2.62.09 ± 0.14-1.34 ± 0.165A527VLER528ALEL529ANEL530A-22.3, -15.32.42, 3.10-1.25, -1.102R531A22.7 ± 2.61.49 ± 0.060.78 ± 0.103L532A-15.2, -23.01.77, 2.08-0.62, -1.112V533A-30.21.65-1.151R534A-30.5 ± 2.52.40 ± 0.20-1.69 ± 0.207V535A-49.9 ± 3.62.25 ± 0.11-2.60 ± 0.235A536V-42.9, -41.32.84, 2.44-2.82, -2.332R537A-31.4, -26.12.57, 2.76-1.87, -1.672K538A-39.4 ± 2.01.91 ± 0.06-1.75 ± 0.106L539A-30.1 ± 1.12.25 ± 0.17-1.57 ± 0.134D540A-20.6 ± 2.21.86 ± 0.36-0.89 ± 0.206D540A-84.2 ± 2.62.20 ± 0.23-4.28 ± 0.486R541A-26.0 ± 0.22.63 ± 0.32-1.58 ± 0.193Y542A-23.0 ± 1.32.42 ± 0.17-1.29 ± 0.128S543A-19.6 ± 3.71.62 ± 0.07-0.73 ± 0.143E544A-33.0 ± 0.82.40 ± 0.11-1.83 ± 0.108Y545A-33.41.92-1.491a LE, low expression (insufficient for gating current measurement)b NE, no expression Open table in a new tab Table IIActivation parameters for hERG channels derived from grel-V relationships fitted with Boltzmann functionsMutationV0.5zΔGnmVe0kcal/molWT-17.7 ± 1.23.21 ± 0.10-1.32 ± 0.1021G514A-19.1 ± 1.22.76 ± 0.19-1.22 ± 0.119S515A-16.5 ± 1.33.43 ± 0.14-1.31 ± 0.1111G516A-26.8 ± 1.13.16 ± 0.20-1.96 ± 0.1510S517A-0.2 ± 2.03.35 ± 0.11-0.01 ± 0.168E518A2.5 ± 1.33.01 ± 0.070.17 ± 0.0916E519A-13.1 ± 0.83.14 ± 0.13-0.96 ± 0.0710L520A-34.6 ± 2.22.52 ± 0.17-2.02 ± 0.1910I521A-27.7 ± 1.12.88 ± 0.12-1.85 ± 0.1110G522A-28.4 ± 1.02.82 ± 0.12-1.85 ± 0.1012L523A-8.5 ± 0.83.07 ± 0.12-0.60 ± 0.0611L524A-4.4 ± 1.42.97 ± 0.05-0.30 ± 0.1015K525ANEaNE, no expressionT526A-17.8 ± 1.43.17 ± 0.12-1.31 ± 0.1112A527V-32.3 ± 1.02.93 ± 0.18-2.19 ± 0.1512R528A-9.0 ± 1.32.86 ± 0.05-0.59 ± 0.0914L529ANEL530A-9.2 ± 1.03.84 ± 0.23-0.81 ± 0.109R531A40.9 ± 0.83.14 ± 0.122.98 ± 0.1310L532A-23.4 ± 0.82.95 ± 0.14-1.60 ± 0.0918V533A-22.6 ± 1.33.49 ± 0.14-1.83 ± 0.1310R534A-17.9 ± 0.73.29 ± 0.13-1.37 ± 0.0810V535A-41.5 ± 1.23.03 ± 0.27-2.91 ± 0.289A536V-34.8 ± 0.83.00 ± 0.20-2.42 ± 0.1710R537A-16.8 ± 0.43.26 ± 0.07-1.27 ± 0.0421K538A-39.6 ± 0.63.70 ± 0.20-3.40 ± 0.199L539A-19.2 ± 0.82.84 ± 0.11-1.26 ± 0.0710D540A-5.0 ± 1.11.61 ± 0.06-0.18 ± 0.047R541A-22.5 ± 2.22.08 ± 0.12-1.08 ± 0.123Y542A-2.9 ± 1.62.05 ± 0.12-0.14 ± 0.0810S543A-37.3 ± 0.62.86 ± 0.16-2.47 ± 0.1414E544A-22.4 ± 1.43.34 ± 0.16-1.73 ± 0.148Y545A-27.5 ± 1.13.20 ± 0.13-2.04 ± 0.119a NE, no expression Open table in a new tab Specific Substitutions in S4 Perturbed Charge Movement— On-gating current (IgON) of WT channels is composed of a fast component (fast IgON) followed by a slow, smaller amplitude component (slow IgON) that represents ∼90% of the total gating charge (25Piper D.R.

These distinct components of IgON are clearly distinguishable during a pulse to +20 mV for WT channels (top panel of Fig. 2A). Although the mutations had a variable effect on the kinetics of gating current, the IgON of all channels could also be readily separated into fast and slow components. R531A, V535A, and D540A mutations had the most dramatic effects on the kinetics and voltage dependence of gating currents. R531A gating current was only detected at potentials ≥ -20 mV, and no slow component was evident at +20 mV (Fig. 2B), indicating a large positive shift in the voltage dependence of charge movement. V535A (Fig. 2C) and especially D540A (Fig. 2D) accelerated the rate of the slow IgON and IgOFF.Fig. 2Gating currents of WT and S4 Ala-substituted mutant channels.A–D, representative gating currents elicited from WT hERG (A), R531A (B), V535A (C), and D540A (D) mutant channels.

V535A and A536V shifted the relationship to the left and L524A and R531A shifted it to the right.

https://openalex.org/W2033952130,"The yeast and Drosophila pathways leading to the production of inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) have been elucidated recently. The in vivo pathway in humans has been assumed to be similar. Here we show that overexpression of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase in human cell lines results in an increase of inositol tetrakisphosphate (InsP4) isomers, inositol pentakisphosphate (InsP5) and InsP6, whereas its depletion by RNA interference decreases the amounts of these inositol phosphates. Expression of Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 5-kinase does not increase the amount of InsP5 and InsP6, although its depletion does block InsP5 and InsP6 production, showing that it is necessary for production of InsP5 and InsP6. Expression of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 2-kinase increases the amount of InsP6 by depleting the InsP5 in the cell, and depletion of 2-kinase decreases the amount of InsP6 and causes an increase in InsP5. These results are consistent with a pathway that produces InsP6 through the sequential action of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 5-kinase, and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 2-kinase to convert Ins(1,3,4)P3 to InsP6.

The many roles for InsP6 necessitates an understanding of the pathway leading to its production. InsP6 is synthesized ultimately from Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Fig. 1). The action of phospholipase C on the lipid phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate yields Ins(1,4,5)P3 and diacylglycerol. Ins(1,4,5)P3 can then be phosphorylated by an Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 or dephosphorylated by an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase to Ins(1,4)P2 (11Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11167-11176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) saw that in addition to the expected increase of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 isomer, Ins(1,3,4)P3 is also increased, as well as Ins(1,3,4,6)P4. They therefore argued that in vivo Ins(1,4,5)P3 is phosphorylated to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 by an Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase, dephosphorylated to Ins(1,3,4)P3 by a 5-phosphatase, and phosphorylated to Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 (Fig. 1A). The increase of Ins(1,3,4)P3 was also seen by Wong et al. (13Wong N.S. Barker C.J. Morris A.J. Craxton A. Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in WRK-1 cells stimulated with vasopressin. Wilson and Majerus (14Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11904-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) isolated a cDNA encoding the human kinase which catalyzes the conversion of Ins(1,3,4)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 and named it Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase because of its ability to phosphorylate both the D-5 and D-6 positions of the inositol ring. The product of 5-kinase activity of 5/6-kinase on Ins(1,3,4)P3 is the same as that of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and as such would lead back to Ins(1,3,4)P3 after the action of a 5-phosphatase. The above data would suggest that the human pathway for the production of InsP6 works through the isomerization of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4)P3, and the sequential phosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 by the 5/6 kinase, of Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 by a 5-kinase, and of InsP5 to InsP6 by a 2-kinase (Fig. 1A). An alternate pathway to the one discussed above was proposed when the yeast pathway was discovered through genetic screens (Fig. 1B). In yeast, Ins(1,4,5)P3 is converted directly to InsP6 by the sequential action of two proteins: Ipk2, which produces InsP5 in a two-step phosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P3, first to Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 and then to InsP5; and Ipk1, which produces InsP6 (1York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 15Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This pathway differs from that proposed by Menniti et al. (12Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Nogimori K. Obie J.F. Shears S.B. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11167-11176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that no isomerization of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4)P3 is required and in that the intermediate InsP4 isomer is not Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 but Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 (15Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Deletion of IPK2 causes an increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3, whereas loss of IPK1 causes a loss of InsP6 and an accumulation of InsP5, proving that there is no other pathway to go from InsP3 to InsP6 in yeast. In addition, yeast cells do not possess a 5/6-kinase, nor has an Ins(1,3,4)P3 isomer been seen in metabolically labeled yeast extracts. The Drosophila and Arabidopsis homologs of IPK2 have been cloned and can complement the yeast Ipk2 deletion mutant (16Seeds A.M. Sandquist J.C. Spana E.P. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47222-47232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Stevenson-Paulik J. Odom A.R. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42711-42718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The Drosophila and Arabidopsis homologs first produce Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 from Ins(1,4,5)P3, and then InsP5 from this InsP4 isomer, as does yeast. Interestingly, when the authors were determining the activities of the Drosophila and Arabidopsis homologs of Ipk2, they found a significant 5-kinase activity on Ins(1,3,4,6)P4. This activity is necessary for the pathway proposed in human cells. Because the yeast pathway works through Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, which is already phosphorylated at the D-5 position, they suggest that this activity is not relevant for the production of InsP6 in these organisms. A cDNA encoding the rat homolog of the yeast Ipk2 was isolated using a conserved sequence found in inositol phosphate kinases (18Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A.M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). These authors found that rat Ipk2 could catalyze the conversion of Ins(1,4)P2 to Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 to the pyrophosphate PP-InsP4. The extensive kinase activity led them to name the enzyme inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) (19Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Sawa A. Luo X. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The 3- and 6-kinase activities match those of yeast Ipk2, although the rat homolog produces Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 first, whereas Ipk2 in yeast produces Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 first. Nonetheless it was inferred that the pathway to InsP6 in mammals may not proceed through the Ins(1,3,4)P3 isomer. Yet this work did not include any in vivo description of the activities, no other InsP4 isomers were tested, the reactions were performed for long times with large quantities of enzyme, and no kinetic data were presented. A cDNA encoding the human homolog of Ipk2 was described in two studies that came to different conclusions regarding its action (20Nalaskowski M.M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Chang S.C. Miller A.L. Feng Y. Wente S.R. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43836-43843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Nalaskowski et al. (20Nalaskowski M.M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that the human homolog could produce Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 from Ins(1,4,5)P3, and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 from this InsP4 in vitro. Its ability to produce InsP5 from InsP3 led them to conclude that this was the human homolog to the rat IPMK and yeast Ipk2, although the InsP4 isomer, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, again differs from that in yeast, Arabidopsis, and Drosophila. Chang et al. (21Chang S.C. Miller A.L. Feng Y. Wente S.R. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43836-43843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) also isolated the human homolog of Ipk2, which they called Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 5-kinase because of its novel substrate specificity. This protein is much more active as a 5-kinase on Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 than as a 6-kinase on Ins(1,3,4,5)P4; its catalytic processivity (κcat) is 43 times greater for the former isomer. This suggests that it phosphorylates Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 to InsP5 in vivo, not Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to InsP5 as suggested by the work of Saiardi et al. (19Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Sawa A. Luo X. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and Nalaskowski et al. (20Nalaskowski M.M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), neither of which tested the Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 isomer. Second, although Chang et al. (21Chang S.C. Miller A.L. Feng Y. Wente S.R. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43836-43843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) found that the human homolog could act as a 3-kinase on Ins(1,4,5)P3 in vitro (its κcat was only 1.6 times less than for Ins(1,3,4,6)P4), it did not complement an Ipk2 deletion mutant in yeast. Therefore, in this in vivo experiment, the human 5-kinase does not convert Ins(1,4,5)P3 to InsP5. This was not a surprising result considering that the human and rat proteins did not make Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 as does yeast, but instead produced Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 from Ins(1,4,5)P3. Chang et al. (21Chang S.C. Miller A.L. Feng Y. Wente S.R. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43836-43843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) concluded that the human homolog of yeast Ipk2 and rat IPMK is primarily an Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 5-kinase; we will refer to this protein as such. These data suggested that the pathway in human cells does work through Ins(1,3,4)P3 in vivo, not Ins(1,4,5)P3, by the sequential actions of 5/6-kinase to make Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, 5-kinase to make InsP5, and 2-kinase to make InsP6. Here we present in vivo data that confirm this pathway in human cells. All chemicals were reagent grade or better. Restriction endonucleases, DNA-modifying enzymes, and general reagents were from Amersham Biochemicals, Roche Applied Science, Fisher, Invitrogen, New England Biolabs, Promega Corp., Sigma, and Stratagene unless stated otherwise. PCR was performed using the Pfu DNA polymerase per the protocol from Stratagene. Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, Washington University, St. Louis, MO. Acrylamide solution, Bio-Safe Coomassie Blue stain, and the Bradford protein assay kit used for protein work were purchased from Bio-Rad. A SuperSignal West Pico kit used for detection of Western transfer blots was from Pierce. Radiolabeled inositol phosphates [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3, [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5), and [3H]InsP6 were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Amersham Biosciences. Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Methods for Escherichia coli growth and selection were described previously (22Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli strain XL-1Blue (Stratagene) was used as the bacterial host for all plasmids unless stated otherwise. Bacterial strains were cultured in LB (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.4) medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin where appropriate and were transformed by standard methods (22Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997Google Scholar, 23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All bacterial strains were grown at 37 °C. Western Blot Analysis—Specified tissue culture cells were treated with trypsin, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm ATP, and proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by two freeze-thaw cycles in an ethanol-dry ice bath, and particulate debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the clarified lysate was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Samples (5 μg) were loaded onto a 10% gel for SDS-PAGE and subsequently electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). For detection of 5-kinase overexpression, anti-Myc antibody (Cell Signaling) was used, and for a loading control, anti-AP1 antibody was used. The appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) were used to visualize the appropriate band. 5-Kinase Enzyme Activity Assay—For each sample, the clarified cellular lysate was prepared as described above. Enzymatic activity was determined as described previously (21Chang S.C. Miller A.L. Feng Y. Wente S.R. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43836-43843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and summarized below. Enzyme was added to 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 1,000–2,000 cpm of [3H]Ins(1,3,4,6) to a total reaction volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for the desired times. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of H2O, and the sample was loaded onto a 500-μl Dowex column (AG 1-X8 formate, mesh 200–400, Bio-Rad) equilibrated in water. The column was washed eight times with 1 ml of 1 m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid to elute the substrate. The product was eluted with 2 ml of 2 m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Synthesis of Radiolabeled Inositol Phosphates—The synthesis of the substrate [3H]Ins(1,3,4,6) was described previously (21Chang S.C. Miller A.L. Feng Y. Wente S.R. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43836-43843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled standards for HPLC analysis were synthesized based on previously published methods for [32P]Ins(1,4,5)P3 (24Downes C.P. Mussat M.C. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), [32P]Ins(1,3,4,5) (25Choi K.Y. Kim H.K. Lee S.Y. Moon K.H. Sim S.S. Kim J.W. Chung H.K. Rhee S.G. Science. 1990; 248: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and [32P]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (26Norris F.A. Wilson M.P. Wallis T.S. Galyov E.E. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14057-14059Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). [32P]Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)P6 was made with the following modifications to the protocol of Stephens et al. (27Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Stanley A.F. Moore T. Poyner D.R. Morris P.J. Hanley M.R. Kay R.R. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); 32Pi-labeled mung beans were homogenized in water, filtered through Whatman No. 3 paper, and loaded on a column of Dowex chloride resin (AG 1-X4, 100–200 mesh, Bio-Rad). The unincorporated phosphate was removed by extensive washing with 0.25 n HCl, and the [32P]InsP6 was eluted with 1.5 n HCl. InsP6 was lyophilized multiple times to remove acid. All standards were confirmed by their elution times relative to commercially purchased 3H-labeled inositol phosphates on an Adsorbosphere SAX HPLC column (Alltech) with a linear gradient of 0–100% 1 m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, at 1 ml/min over 120 min. Construction of Stably Transfected Cell Lines Overexpressing Inositol Phosphate Kinases—–HEK-293 cells expressing 5/6-kinase were constructed as reported previously (28Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 2-kinase-expressing cells and 5-kinase-expressing cells were constructed using the tetracycline-inducible vector pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen). The 2-kinase gene used previously for expression in Sf9 cells (29Verbsky J.W. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M.V. Majerus P.W. Wente S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31857-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pcDNA4/TO vector using the BamHI and NotI restriction sites; the resulting construct has 2-kinase preceded by a FLAG tag. The human 5-kinase cDNA was subcloned from the plasmid host pTrcHisA (Invitrogen) (21Chang S.C. Miller A.L. Feng Y. Wente S.R. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43836-43843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) by PCR with 5′-CATGCCATGGCAACAGAGCCACCATCCCCCCTC-3′ and 5′-CGGGGTACCAATTGTCTAAAATACTTCGAAGTAC-3′ primers. The resulting PCR product has 5-prime NcoI and 3-prime KpnI restriction sites and is inserted into the NcoI/KpnI sites of the plasmid pTrcHis2B (Invitrogen) in-frame with a 3-prime Myc tag. A second PCR with 5′-CGGGGTACCTCCGTTATGGCAACAGAGCCACCATCCCCC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAATTCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAG-3′ primers using the pTrcHis2B construct of the human 5-kinase generated a product with 5-prime KpnI and 3-prime BamHI restriction sites flanking the human 5-kinase cDNA in-frame with a 3-prime Myc tag; this construct was ligated into the mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA4/TO. All PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. Stable cell lines were constructed by transfecting these constructs into HEK-293 TRex cells (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), plating serial dilutions of the transfected cells, and selecting them in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Tet system approved, Clontech), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, 5 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen), and 0.4 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) until single colonies were obtained. Stable cell lines were maintained in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Tet system approved, Clontech), 2 mm glutamine, 5 μg/ml blasticidin, and 0.3 mg/ml Zeocin. These gene products were induced with 0.2 μg/ml tetracycline unless otherwise noted. Expression of the human 5-kinase was verified by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies recognizing the Myc epitope (Cell Signaling) and by enzyme activity assays, whereas expression of 2-kinase was verified by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies recognizing the FLAG epitope (Sigma) of 2-kinase. Gene Silencing of the Inositol Phosphate Kinases—The preannealed siRNA oligonucleotides used for gene silencing of the inositol phosphate kinases were synthesized by Dharmacon RNA Technologies. The oligonucleotides used for the human 5-kinase were sense 5′-GGAUGGAGUCUCCAGAUUAdTdT-3′ and antisense 5′-AAAUCUGGAGACUCCAUCCdTdT-3′, for the luciferase control were sense 5′-CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGAdTdT-3′ and antisense 5′-UCGAAGUACUCAGCGUAAGdTdT-3′, and for 2-kinase were sense 5′-GAAGACCUCGGAAGAGAUUdTdT-3′ and antisense 5′-UAUCUCUUCCGAGGUCUUCdTdT-3′. Tissue culture cells were grown to 85–95% confluence in 12-well plates with or without tetracycline in standard media and transfected with 1.6 μg of siRNA oligonucleotide using Lipofectamine 2000 per the manufacturer's protocol. After 6 h, the cells were treated with trypsin, transferred to 6-well plates, and then grown overnight in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. A second transfection with 4 μg of siRNA oligonucleotide was performed using Lipofectamine 2000, and after a 6-h incubation, the cells were transferred to 10-cm plates containing media with or without 10 μCi/ml [3H]inositol and with or without 0.2 μg/ml tetracycline. After 3 days, cells were harvested for Western blot analysis and HPLC of soluble inositol phosphates. Densitometry of the bands from the Western blot analysis was performed using the Kodak one-dimensional 3.5 software with the Kodak Image Station 440CF. Construction of the 5/6-kinase RNAi stable cell line was described previously (30Sun Y. Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43645-43653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Analysis of Soluble Inositol Phosphates—Cells were grown in complete media containing 10 μCi/ml [3H]inositol for at least 72 h with or without tetracycline induction. Cells were lysed in methanol and 0.5 n HCl (2:1) and extracted with chloroform. The aqueous phase was separated, dried, and resuspended in water. 32P-Labeled standards were added to each sample. The samples were applied to a 4.6 × 250-mm Adsorbosphere SAX HPLC column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, over 120 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, using a modification of the method of Hughes et al. (31Hughes P.J. Hughes A.R. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For 2-kinase overexpression or RNAi lines a Whatman Partisphere SAX strong anion exchange column (4.6 × 125 mm) was used running a 30-min gradient from 0 to 1.7 m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, followed by a 30-min step of 1.7 m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5. Radioactivity was measured using the inline detector β-RAM (IN/US System Inc.), and the identity of the individual inositol phosphates was assigned on the basis of coelution with known standards. Overexpression of the Inositol 5/6-Kinase Results in Elevated Levels of InsP4, InsP5, and InsP6—Stable HEK-293 cells expressing a tetracycline-inducible 5/6-kinase were labeled with [3H]inositol for 3–4 days, their soluble inositol phosphates extracted, and equal counts of soluble inositol phosphates were separated on an Adsorbosphere SAX HPLC column. Two sets of labeling experiments were performed, one of log phase growing cells (Fig. 2, A and B) and another of confluent cells (Fig. 2, C and D). 5/6-Kinase-expressing lines were either uninduced (Fig. 2, A and C) or induced with 0.2 μg/ml tetracycline (Fig. 2, B and D). Induced cells had elevated levels of Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 (7-fold and 2-fold increase in log phase and confluently growing cells, respectively), and they also showed elevated levels of InsP5 (3-fold and 5-fold, respectively) and InsP6 (1.7-fold and 2-fold, respectively). This suggests that the product of the 5/6-kinase reaction, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, is phosphorylated to InsP5, which is then phosphorylated to InsP6. A large amount of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is seen in labeling of confluently growing 5/6-kinase-overexpressing cell lines (Fig. 2, C and D), which is not seen consistently in labeling of log phase growing cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is thought to arise from the action of a 1-phosphatase on InsP5 (32Ho M.W. Yang X. Carew M.A. Zhang T. Hua L. Kwon Y.U. Chung S.K. Adelt S. Vogel G. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Shears S.B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 477-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It therefore mirrors the rise in InsP5. Silencing of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-Kinase Decreases InsP5 and InsP6 Levels—Overexpression of 5/6-kinase showed that its activity was sufficient to produce Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, InsP5, and InsP6. We then asked whether it was necessary for production of the higher inositol phosphates, using HeLa cells stably transfected with the 5/6-kinase RNAi construct (30Sun Y. Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43645-43653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When labeled with [3H]inositol, these cells show a decrease in Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 (to 12.7% of control levels), in InsP5 (to 13%) and in InsP6 (to 71%). Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is also decreased (to 20%), consistent with a loss of its source, InsP5. When the portions of the chromatograms corresponding to the InsP3 isomers are lined up by the internal standards and expanded, one clearly sees an increase in Ins(1,3,4)P3 in the 5/6-kinase RNAi cell line compared with the vector cell line (Fig. 3C). Therefore, 5/6-kinase is necessary for production of Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 and also for InsP5 and InsP6. Cells Expressing the 5-Kinase Show No Increase in InsP5 or InsP6 Levels—HEK-293 cells were stably transfected with the cDNA encoding 5-kinase under the regulation of a tetracycline-inducible system (T-REx, Invitrogen) as described under “Materials and Methods.” In the presence of tetracycline, a 10-fold increase in the 5-kinase enzymatic activity was observed, whereas without tetracycline, the activity is similar to that of the control HEK-293 cells stably transfected with vector DNA with or without tetracycline (Fig. 4A). Induction of 5-kinase was confirmed by the presence of Myc-tagged protein only in the presence of tetracycline in the stable cell line, whereas no recombinant 5-kinase protein was observed in vector cells (Fig. 4B) or in the uninduced stable cell line. To determine the effect of overexpression of 5-kinase on soluble inositol phosphates in vivo, 5-kinase stable HEK-293 cells were labeled with 10 μCi/ml [3H]inositol for 3 days in the presence or absence of tetracycline. Soluble inositol phosphates were extracted and resolved by Adsorbosphere"
https://openalex.org/W2075415414,"Little is known about endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export signals, particularly those of members of the G-protein-coupled receptor family. We investigated the structural motifs involved in membrane export of the human pituitary vasopressin V1b/V3 receptor. A series of V3 receptors carrying deletions and point mutations were expressed in AtT20 corticotroph cells. We analyzed the export of these receptors by monitoring radioligand binding and by analysis of a V3 receptor tagged with both green fluorescent protein and Myc epitopes by a novel flow cytometry-based method. This novel method allowed us to quantify total and membrane-bound receptor expression. Receptors lacking the C terminus were not expressed at the cell surface, suggesting the presence of an export motif in this domain. The distal C terminus contains two di-acidic (DXE) ER export motifs; however, mutating both these motifs had no effect on the V3 receptor export. The proximal C terminus contains a di-leucine 345LL346 motif surrounded by the hydrophobic residues Phe341, Asn342, and Leu350. The mutation of one or more of these five residues abolished up to 100% of the receptor export. In addition, these mutants colocalized with calnexin, demonstrating that they were retained in the ER. Finally, this motif was sufficient to confer export properties on a CD8α glycoprotein-V3 receptor chimera. In conclusion, we have identified a novel export motif, FN(X)2LL(X)3L, in the C terminus of the V3 receptor. Little is known about endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export signals, particularly those of members of the G-protein-coupled receptor family. We investigated the structural motifs involved in membrane export of the human pituitary vasopressin V1b/V3 receptor.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; AVP, [Arg8]vasopressin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PNGase F, glycopeptide N-glycosidase F; ANOVA, analysis of variance; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Endo H, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; LSD test, least significant difference test. form the largest superfamily of the signal transduction cell surface proteins (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). GPCRs are comprised of seven transmembrane domains, an extracellular N terminus, and a cytosolic C terminus. Numerous studies (2Tsao P. von Cao T. Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 3Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 4Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have identified sequences in these receptors that are essential for ligand binding, G-protein coupling, desensitization, and internalization. In contrast, little is known about the sequences required for the transport of these proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane. Naturally occurring mutations in certain GPCRs result in impaired membrane export and lead to several diseases including retinitis pigmentosa (rhodopsin receptor) and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (vasopressin V2 receptor) (5Stojanovic A. Hwa J. Recept. Channels. 2002; 8: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6Morello J.P. Bichet D.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 607-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Increasing our understanding of the molecular determinants and mechanisms underlying GPCR export is essential for elucidating the pathophysiology of these diseases and for improving the treatments available. Translocation from the ER is a critical and rate-limiting checkpoint of functional membrane-bound protein production and brings in two steps (7Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). First, quality control takes place within the lumen of the ER and involves ubiquitous ER resident chaperone proteins. These proteins ensure the correct folding, stability, and maturation of the membrane-bound proteins by means of hydrophobic interactions, formation of disulfide bridges, and addition of oligosaccharide moieties. A second set of chaperones, specific for a protein subset or family, then verifies the folding of the membrane cargo proteins before ER export. This system ensures that only native proteins reach their final destination. If the folding and maturation process fails, the protein is not transported to the plasma membrane and is retained in internal compartments. These proteins then undergo ER-associated degradation, a pathway linked to the proteasome (8Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 9Sitia R. Braakman I. Nature. 2003; 426: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 10Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Little is known about the folding and maturation processes involved in GPCR expression and in particular about the chaperones interacting with the cytosolic domains of these receptors. Several conserved C-terminal motifs seem to be involved in GPCR folding such as the di-leucine motif E(X)3LL of the vasopressin V2 receptor and the di-leucine motif F(x)6I/LL of the α2B-adrenergic and angiotensin AT1 receptors (11Krause G. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. Schulein R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 232-242PubMed Google Scholar, 12Duvernay M.T. Zhou F. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30741-30750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When the folding step is achieved, the protein leaves the ER. Evidence is mounting that the ER export of at least some membrane proteins is a selective process, involving the recruitment and concentration of cargo proteins in prebudding complexes. The formation of these complexes may involve interactions with the coat protein complex (COPII), COPII-associated proteins, or a cargo receptor. These interactions may result in either the masking of an ER retention signal (KDEL, KKXX, or RXR sequences) or the unmasking of an ER export signal (10Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 13Barlowe C. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 295-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Two of these export signals have been extensively characterized: the C-terminal di-acidic DXE motif of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein, and the di-phenylalanine FF motif of endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment-53 and members of the p24 protein family (14Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 15Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 16Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). None of these motifs have been found in the C terminus of GPCRs, but a recent report (17Bermak J.C. Li M. Bullock C. Zhou Q.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) indicates that the proximal C terminus of the dopamine D1 receptor contains a F(X)3F(X)3F motif that is required for the proper export of this receptor from the ER. This motif confers export properties on a truncated CD8α glycoprotein that is normally retained and binds to the ER membrane-associated chaperone protein DRiP78 (17Bermak J.C. Li M. Bullock C. Zhou Q.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These findings highlight the role played by the C-terminal domain of GPCRs in mediating the folding and export of these receptors. This domain varies in length but is generally composed of a highly conserved hydrophobic proximal region, forming an amphipathic α-helix and a randomly coiled segment (18Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong LeI. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar). Deletion of this C-terminal domain results in the retention of many GPCRs in the ER (12Duvernay M.T. Zhou F. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30741-30750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Oksche A. Dehe M. Schulein R. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Pankevych H. Korkhov V. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30283-30293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but the precise role of this region is not known, and the mechanism mediating the transport of GPCRs from the ER to the plasma membrane remains to be defined. In this study, we investigated intracellular trafficking and cell surface expression of the human pituitary vasopressin V1b/V3 receptor (V3). This receptor is involved in adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion and the stress response (21Tanoue A. Ito S. Honda K. Oshikawa S. Kitagawa Y. Koshimizu T.A. Mori T. Tsujimoto G. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of this receptor contains two distal di-acidic motifs (DXE) and a proximal di-leucine motif surrounded by hydrophobic amino acids. We identified a novel ER export signal in the hydrophobic region of the proximal C terminus of the V3 receptor. This signal consists of a 341FN(X)2LL(X)3L350 motif. Its disruption impaired ER export and transport of the receptor to the cell surface. Moreover, this motif was sufficient to confer transport properties on a CD8α glycoprotein-V3 receptor chimera. Materials—Culture reagents were obtained from Sigma, BD Biosciences (Nu-serum), HyClone (Fetalclone III), or Invitrogen. Enzymes for molecular cloning were purchased from New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. Radioactive vasopressin, [3H]AVP (60–70 Ci/mmol), was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [Arg8]vasopressin (AVP) was obtained from Bachem. TOPRO-3 iodide was purchased from Molecular Probes. Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) (EC 3.2.1.96) and glycopeptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (EC 3.5.1.52) were obtained from New England Biolabs. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-c-Myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse anti-adaptin-γ, mouse anti-CD8α, and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (BD Biosciences); rabbit anti-calnexin and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma); mouse anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science); rabbit anti-GFP (Clontech); mouse anti-CD8α-phycoerythrin-conjugated (Beckman Instruments); Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). DNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Constructs were subcloned into the BamHI-XbaI sites of the ps-EGFP-6myc vector (22Miserey-Lenkei S. Parnot C. Bardin S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5891-5901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This vector was constructed using the pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech) and contained the signal peptide of the insulin receptor (ps) upstream of the EGFP sequence and six copies of the Myc epitope downstream of the EGFP sequence followed by the vector polylinker. An EGFP-deleted version of this vector (ps-6myc) was generated by deletion of the EGFP sequence and in-frame insertion of a linker. An initial expression vector coding for an N-terminal double-tagged wild type human V3 receptor was generated in the ps-EGFP-6myc vector (ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-WT) as follows: PCR was used to introduce BamHI (5′) and PmlI-XbaI (3′) restriction sites flanking the N-terminal and transmembrane sequences of the V3 receptor (residues 1–344), and to introduce EcoRV (5′) and XbaI (3′) restriction sites flanking the C terminus (residues 345–424) of the receptor. Both fragments were then ligated into the BamHI-XbaI sites in the polylinker of the ps-EGFP-6myc vector. Several C-terminally deleted constructs were generated as follows: the ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-ΔCter construct, lacking 80 C-terminal amino acid residues, was generated by PCR amplification of the N-terminal and transmembrane sequences of the V3 receptor, and insertion of this fragment into the BamHI-XbaI sites of the ps-EGFP-6myc vector. The ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-Δ345–403 (lacking 58 C-terminal amino acids), Δ355–424 (lacking 69 C-terminal amino acids), Δ359–424 (lacking 65 C-terminal amino acids), and Δ371–424 (lacking 53 C-terminal amino acids) constructs were produced by inserting various linkers into the PmlI-XbaI sites of the ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-ΔCter vector. The ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-Δ387–424 construct was obtained by inserting a linker into the NaeI-XbaI sites of the ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-Δ371–424 vector. The ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-Δ409–424 construct was generated by PCR amplification of the C-terminal fragment (residues 345–408) and subsequent subcloning of this fragment into the PmlI-XbaI sites of the ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-ΔCter vector. The ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-Δ344–364 construct was obtained by NaeI-XbaI digestion of ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-WT and insertion of the resulting fragment into the PmlI-XbaI sites of the ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-ΔCter. Point mutations of the proximal C-terminal 341FNSHLLPRPL350 and the two distal C-terminal DXE, 409DLELADGE416, motifs were generated from ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-WT vector using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Untagged or Myc-tagged versions of two of these mutants (F341T/N342T/L345T/L346T/L350T and D409A/E411A/D414A/D416A) and of the wild type (WT) receptor were subcloned into the BamHI-XbaI sites of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and the ps-6myc vector. The chimeras, CD8-V3-WT and CD8-V3-MUT, were generated by in-frame fusion of the CD8α glycoprotein extracellular and transmembrane domains (residues 1–206) from the pCN plasmid (23Erdtmann L. Janvier K. Raposo G. Craig H.M. Benaroch P. Berlioz-Torrent C. Guatelli J.C. Benarous R. Benichou S. Traffic. 2000; 1: 871-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to the C terminus of the WT (residues 340–424) or mutated (341TT(X)2TT(X)3-T350) V3 receptors, respectively. Constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—Mouse corticotroph AtT20 cells (ATCC, CRL-1795) were cultured (37 °C, 5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 7.5% Fetalclone III, 7.5% Nu-serum, and 0.5 mm glutamine. Cells were transiently transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All analyses were performed 24–48 h after transfection. A stable cell line was established for the ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-WT transfectant. Stable transfectants were generated using LipofectAMINE reagent followed by G418 (Invitrogen) selection. Clones were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). FACS—Transient transfectants were grown to confluence in 6-well dishes, washed twice with PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA, and dissociated by treatment with cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibodies diluted (1:200) in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Cells were then washed and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (diluted 1:50) for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. For CD8-V3-WT and CD8-V3-MUT chimera labeling, cells were incubated with anti-CD8α phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies (diluted 1:25) for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Unbound antibodies were removed by three rounds of washing (with PBS) followed by centrifugation (100 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). TOPRO-3 iodide (2 μg/ml) was added to detect living cells. Transfectants were then analyzed by FACS using a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer. Cells positive for EGFP fluorescence were analyzed for phycoerythrin-derived fluorescence. Autofluorescence was determined by measuring nontransfected AtT20 cells treated with phycoerythrin-coupled secondary antibodies. The ratio of phycoerythrin fluorescence (surface expression) to EGFP fluorescence (total expression) was calculated from measurements of 2500 cells as follows: ((meanPE - meanauto)/meanEGFP, n = 2500), where auto is the autofluorescence and PE is the phycoerythrin fluorescence. Radioligand Binding Assay—Transiently transfected cells were grown to confluence in 24-well dishes. Cells were then washed with PBS supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% BSA, and 1 mg/ml bacitracin, pH 7.4, and incubated with [3H]AVP in the same buffer for2hat4 °C. After washing twice with cold PBS, cells were suspended in a solution containing 0.1% SDS and 0.1 n NaOH and transferred to liquid scintillation vials for counting. Nonspecific binding was measured after incubation in the presence of 2 μm AVP. Kinetic constants (Kd) were derived from saturation experiments as described previously (24Ventura M.A. Rene P. de Keyzer Y. Bertagna X. Clauser E. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 22: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Crude membrane extracts from transiently transfected AtT20 cells were prepared, and incubations with [3H]AVP were carried out as described previously (25Derick S. Cheng L.L. Voirol M.J. Stoev S. Giacomini M. Wo N.C. Szeto H.H. Mimoun BenM. Andres M. Gaillard R.C. Guillon G. Manning M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4655-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Radioligand binding and flow cytometry assays were both performed on the same day, and binding data were normalized for each EGFP-tagged construct using the total expression level of receptor protein, determined by measuring EGFP fluorescence. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—For selective labeling of cell surface receptors, transiently or stably transfected cells were grown to confluence in Lab-Teck (Nunc) chambered cover glasses, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Cells were then washed (PBS) and incubated with anti-c-Myc primary antibodies (diluted 1:200) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (diluted 1:1000) for 1 h. To determine whether the receptors colocalized with internal compartment markers, cells were fixed and permeabilized at room temperature with 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated with antibodies against calnexin (an ER marker) (diluted 1:1000) or against adaptin-γ (a Golgi apparatus marker) (diluted 1:600) for 1 h at room temperature. Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (diluted 1:1000) were used to detect anti-calnexin and anti-adaptin γ, respectively. For detection of the CD8-V3-WT and CD8-V3-MUT chimeras, permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cells were incubated with mouse anti-CD8α antibodies (diluted 1:50) for 1 h and then with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (diluted 1:1000) for 1 h. Fluorescence was detected using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope. Immunoprecipitation, Deglycosylation, and Western Blot Analysis— Cells were transfected in Petri dishes. Forty eight hours later, the transient transfectants were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, complete anti-protease mixture (Roche Applied Science), for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, the total cell lysates were incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and 3–5 μg of a mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody overnight with gentle rotation. The beads were then washed and boiled in SDS sample buffer. For deglycosylation, the beads were washed and boiled for 10 min with denaturing buffer and then incubated at 37 °C for 16 h with either PNGase F or Endo H, according to the instructions of the manufacturers. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. For Western blotting, proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation of the membranes with 5% milk. Membranes were then incubated with an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000) overnight at 4 °C, washed, and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:50,000). The blotted proteins were revealed using the ECL kit (Pierce). Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as means (±S.D.). We used ANOVA to analyze differences between groups. When significant differences were detected by ANOVA, a posteriori comparisons between means were conducted using the Fisher least significant difference (LSD) test (α = 0.05). Calculations were carried out using the StatView program. Quantification of Receptor Export by an Original Flow Cytometry-based Method and Ligand Binding Assays—We tagged the N terminus of the wild type (WT) and mutant V3 receptors with both EGFP and Myc epitopes to prevent modification of the C-terminal domain conformation, a process suspected to be involved in receptor export to the cell surface. This double labeling also allowed us to quantify and to compare receptor trafficking by flow cytometry. Total chimeric receptor levels were measured by EGFP fluorescence, and surface receptor levels were measured indirectly by immunofluorescence labeling of the extracellular Myc epitopes (Fig. 1A). We calculated the ratio of immunolabel fluorescence to EGFP to compare the membrane export of the different receptor constructs. Moreover, an excellent correlation was observed between FACS and binding data (Figs. 2A, 3, 4, B and C, 5A, and 6, A and B). Our ligand binding assays showed that the affinities of the ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-WT and V3-WT receptors for [3H]AVP were similar (Kd = 3.7 ± 0.63 and 3.4 ± 0.25, respectively) (Fig. 1, B and C). Our analysis of [3H]AVP binding also indicated that the level of plasma membrane expression was lower for the ps-EGFP-6myc-V3-WT receptor than for the V3-WT receptor.Fig. 1Expression of the double-tagged V3 receptor. A, schematic representation of the double-tagged V3 receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2154876959,"The use of recombinant T cell receptors (TCRs) to target therapeutic interventions has been hindered by the naturally low affinity of TCR interactions with peptide major histocompatibility complex ligands. Here, we use multimeric forms of soluble heterodimeric αβ TCRs for specific detection of target cells pulsed with cognate peptide, discrimination of quantitative changes in antigen display at the cell surface, identification of virus-infected cells, inhibition of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation, and identification of cross-reactive peptides. Notably, the A6 TCR specific for the immunodominant HLA A2-restricted human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax11–19 epitope bound to HLA A2-HuD87–95 (KD 120 μM by surface plasmon resonance), an epitope implicated as a causal antigen in the paraneoplastic neurological degenerative disorder anti-Hu syndrome. A mutant A6 TCR that exhibited dramatically increased affinity for cognate antigen (KD 2.5 nM) without enhanced cross-reactivity was generated; this TCR demonstrated potent biological activity even as a monomeric molecule. These data provide insights into TCR repertoire selection and delineate a framework for the selective modification of TCRs in vitro that could enable specific therapeutic intervention in vivo."

Here we establish the caveolin-1 gene promoter as a cell type-specific model for SREBP/Sp1 regulation whereby lipoprotein cholesterol depletion activates caveolin-1 transcription in endothelial type cells, but not in fibroblasts, both in vitro and in vivo. By extending this model, we describe a novel pathway distinct from the prototypical SREBP/Sp1 regulatory loop involving the Sp1-like protein, KLF11. Through a combination of RNA interference, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and reporter assays, we demonstrate that in the presence of cholesterol, KLF11 acts as a dominant repressor of the caveolin-1 gene. Mechanistically, cholesterol depletion results in displacement of KLF11 from an Sp1 site flanking an SRE, indicating that activation by SREBP/Sp1 requires antagonism of KLF11 repression. The displacement of KLF11 results from both a down-regulation of its expression and competition by Sp1 for DNA binding. Therefore, these studies identify a novel pathway whereby KLF11 repression is coordinated with Sp1/SREBP activation of cholesterol-dependent gene expression in a cell type-specific manner and outline the mechanisms by which these functions are achieved.

However, the role for KLF proteins in coordination with SREBP and Sp1 in the context of cholesterol-dependent target genes is unexplored.Caveolins are a family of 22-kDa proteins that are implicated in cholesterol homeostasis, signal transduction, and vesicle trafficking (14Smart E.

Experimental evidence indicates that the caveolin-1 gene is a cholesterol target gene particularly in fibroblast cells (16Fielding C. Bist A. Fielding P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The vascular endothelium is particularly enriched in the caveolin-1 member of the caveolin protein family and because of the prominent endothelium-specific effects of cholesterol modulation (19Li S.

Sessa W. Stan R. Anderson R. Malik A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L1179-L1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar).The present studies uncover several novel findings that expand our understanding of the cell type-specific, molecular mechanisms of cholesterol target gene regulation through SREBP and Sp1 by demonstrating antagonistic interactions between SREBP/Sp1, and the Sp1-like protein, KLF11, using the caveolin-1 promoter as a model. We describe a model in which lipoprotein depletion activates caveolin-1 gene expression in vitro and in vivo in vascular endothelium but not in fibroblasts. Extending this model, we demonstrate that a SRE/Sp1-dependent mechanism is responsible for these divergent effects of lipoprotein depletion in different cell types and that KLF11 acts as a dominant repressor of the caveolin-1 gene in the presence of cholesterol. Mechanistically, cholesterol depletion results in displacement of KLF11 from this Sp1 site through down-regulation of KLF11 expression and competition by Sp1 for DNA binding. Thus, these studies delineate a novel co-regulatory role of KLF11 in the canonical SREBP/Sp1 pathway of cholesterol gene regulation by demonstrating that activation is not only achieved by the presence of a transcriptional activator but rather requires antagonism of a pre-existing repressed state.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Plasmid Construction—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC; VecTec, P3-P6), ECV 304 cells, HEK 293 cells, and human skin fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin. For cholesterol depletion experiments, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then transferred to varying volume ratios of normal human serum (NHS; Sigma) and human lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS; Sigma) for 16 h or as indicated in individual experiments. In some analyses, LPDS was supplemented with human LDL (Sigma) at concentrations between 0.05 and 0.2 mg/ml during the full duration of LPDS incubation.Using genomic DNA from Hep G2 cells as template and synthetic oligomers as primers (5′-GGGGTACCCCATTGTTCCAGAAAATATCGG-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCTTCCCTGGGCTGTGCTTTAAGGG-3′), the 5′-flanking region (bp –737 to –37) previously identified as the caveolin-1 promoter region (17Bist A.

The PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with KpnI and HindIII, and cloned into the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL3. The deletion constructs were generated using standard molecular biology techniques and cloned into pGL3. All of the constructs were verified by sequencing.RNA Expression Analysis—For Northern blotting, total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 5.0 μg of RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde. RNA was then transferred to a Nylon membrane and immobilized by UV cross-linking. After UV cross-linking, the membranes were pre-hybridized and hybridized with cDNA encoding full-length caveolin-1 or 18 S rRNA, each labeled using RadPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). After washing, the blots were then exposed to a phosphorus imaging plate and analyzed using the Storm 840 image analysis system (Molecular Dynamics). Band density was normalized to the intensity of 18 S. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed as per our previously published protocol (7Fernandez Zapico M. Mladek A. Ellenrieder V. Folch-Puy E. Miller L. Urrutia R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4748-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Protein lysates were prepared from cultured cells and from aortic endothelial cell monolayers scraped from pigs that were fed either normal chow diet or a hypercholesterolemic diet (2% cholesterol, 15% lard; Harland Teklad, Madison, WI) for 12 weeks as per our previous studies with this model (24Herrmann J.

The cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate (Sigma), 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (1 mg/ml aprotinin, 150 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin) as previously described (25Cao S.

Extracted protein was quantified by the Lowry assay, and the proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Caveolin-1 detection was performed using a polyclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), whereas SREBP detection was performed using a monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), followed by respective peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL®; Amersham Biosciences). The protein levels of the housekeeping gene actin were assayed for internal control of protein loading.Thin Layer Chromatography—After incubation of cells with NHS and LPDS for 16 h, BAEC were scraped in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and an aliquot of this suspension was used for protein assay, whereas the remainder of the cell suspension was utilized for cholesterol extraction as previously described (26Puri V. Jefferson J. Singh R. Wheatley C. Marks D. Pagano R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20961-20970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The lower chloroform layer was removed and dried under a N2 jet. A solution of 19:1 CHCl3/CH3OH was added and then loaded on thin layer chromatography using 65:15:1 of CHCl3/C2H5O C2H5/CH3COOH as the developing solvent. After drying and I2 staining, scanning densitometry was used to measure the concentration of cholesterol based on standards run in parallel and normalized for total cellular protein.Promoter-Reporter Assay—Because BAEC are not amenable to transfection, promoter-reporter experiments were performed in ECV 304 cells, which are a transformed cell line that maintain some phenotypic characteristics typical of endothelial cells (27Paxinou E. Weisse M. Chen Q. Souza J. Hertkorn C. Selak M. Daikhin E. Yudkoff M. Sowa G. Sessa W. Ischiropoulos H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cells were cultured in 24-well plates and transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3, encoding full-length caveolin-1 promoter DNA or indicated deletion constructs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The cells were also co-transfected with a Rous sarcoma virus-Renilla luciferase reporter gene. In some experiments, cDNA encoding Sp1 or KLF 9, 10, 11, 13, or 16 was also transfected into cells. Next day, the cells were serum-starved, incubated with varying volume concentrations of NHS and LPDS for 16 h, and then lysed. Luciferase activity was determined from cell lysates with a dual luciferase assay system (Promega) in which firefly luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer, and the data were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity to control for transfection efficiency (29Cao S. Yao J. Shah V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5894-5901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To assay promoter-reporter activity in fibroblast cells, the experiments were performed with human skin fibroblasts with other experimental conditions remaining identical to that described above.Sp1 RNA interference was achieved using a pool of four siRNA duplexes obtained from Dharmacon Research (SMARTpool, Lafayette, CO) (30Reynolds A. Leake D. Boese Q. Scaringe S. Marshall W. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). The nonsilencing control siRNA targeted a DNA sequence (AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) with no matches upon BLAST search and was obtained from Qiagen. Transfection with siRNA was performed using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) with the final concentration of siRNA being 100 nm. The cells were then transfected with caveolin-1 promoter plasmid, and luciferase activity was determined as described above. Aliquots of cell lysates were used for Western blotting to confirm the specificity and level of Sp1 protein knockdown.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—5.0 μg of BAEC nuclear extract was incubated in a binding buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.0 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 15 min on ice. Wild type and mutant 32P-labeled probes encoding three GC-rich 10-bp regions, located at –646 to –637 and –395 to –386 and at –287 to –278 from the caveolin-1 translation initiation site (termed SRE1, SRE2, and SRE3), were added, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. In some experiments, an excess of cold probe, at the indicated dilutions, was added concomitant with the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The mixture was electrophoresed at 12.5 V/cm on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE. The gel was vacuum-dried, and the autoradiographs were obtained. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments to examine competition between Sp1 and KLF11 were performed in a similar manner except that the labeled probe was a GC box sequence, ATTCGATCGGGGCCGGGGCGAGC or a Sp1-binding site sequence from the caveolin-1 promoter, ACCTTTGGCGGGCGGCCAGG. Probes were incubated with cell extracts derived from Panc1 cells or with recombinant GST-KLF11 zinc finger protein.Oligonucleotide Capture Assay—Nucleoprotein identification was performed using a modified oligonucleotide capture assay (Roche Applied Science) (31Teale B. Singh S. Khanna K. Findik D. Lavin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10295-10301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Copies of oligonucleotides containing the sequence for SRE3 (GCACCCCA) were directly synthesized. These oligonucleotides underwent a self-priming reaction during the PCR, resulting in long concatamers that were ligated to the tethered oligonucleotide on the streptavidin magnetic particles. Bound protein was separated from the crude nuclear extract with a magnetic separator and washed extensively. Bound proteins were eluted from the magnetic particles and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by silver stain or alternatively by Western blot analysis using an SREBP-1 monoclonal antibody. A random sequence was generated and used as a negative control.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as we previously described (7Fernandez Zapico M. Mladek A. Ellenrieder V. Folch-Puy E. Miller L. Urrutia R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4748-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, BAEC and fibroblasts were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 20 min at 25 °C, harvested in SDS-lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and sheared to fragment DNA. The samples were then immunoprecipitated using agarose-conjugated antibodies to Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), KLF11 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), irrelevant control antibody (actin monoclonal antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or protein A-agarose beads alone at 4 °C overnight. Following immunoprecipitation, the samples were washed and eluted using a chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cross-links were removed at 65 °C for 4 h, and immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using phenol/chloroform extraction (500 μl) and ethanol precipitation. Sp1- and KLF11-bound DNA was detected by visualizing PCR products on a 2% agarose gel.Statistical Analysis—All of the experiments were performed at least three times, each in duplicate. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E.RESULTSCholesterol Diminishes Endothelial Caveolin-1 mRNA and Protein Levels in Vitro and in Vivo—Caveolin-1 expression is important for cholesterol-mediated endothelial cell signaling. Interestingly, caveolin-1 mRNA levels were increased 4-fold in BAEC exposed to lipoprotein depletion achieved by incubating cells for 16 h with 30% LPDS, as compared with 30% NHS, as depicted in the representative Northern blot (Fig. 1A, left panel). Concentration dependence of the stimulatory effect of lipoprotein depletion on caveolin-1 mRNA levels in endothelial cells, achieved by altering the volume ratio of NHS and LPDS in the culture medium, thereby varying the degree of cholesterol depletion, revealed that increasing the volume ratio of LPDS compared with NHS was associated with incremental increases in caveolin-1 mRNA levels as depicted in the densitometric calculations compiled from Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1A, right panel). To further establish the specific role of lipoproteins in the aforementioned Northern blot analyses, we next sought to determine whether supplementation of exogenous LDL could reverse the increase in caveolin-1 mRNA levels detected in response to lipoprotein depletion. As seen in Fig. 1B (left panel), supplementation of 0.1 mg/ml of LDL to LPDS entirely negated the increase in caveolin-1 mRNA levels, which occurred in response to cholesterol depletion in BAEC.To confirm that our experimental conditions did indeed modulate intracellular cholesterol levels, we measured total cellular cholesterol from cells incubated with NHS, LPDS, and LPDS plus LDL. As seen in Fig. 1C, cholesterol levels, as assayed by thin layer chromatography and normalized for cellular protein, were reduced by incubation of cells with LPDS, and this reduction was negated by supplementation of exogenous LDL (0.05 mg/ml). These results were corroborated by studies utilizing the cholesterol-binding probe, filipin, which demonstrated prominent filipin staining in cells incubated with NHS but not highly detected in cells incubated with LPDS (data not shown).We next established the biologic relevance of the aforementioned findings by examining caveolin-1 protein levels in an animal model of hypercholesterolemia. To examine this paradigm in vivo, we examined caveolin-1 protein levels from aortic endothelial cell lysates scraped from pigs fed a high cholesterol diet in the context of a well established 12-week feeding protocol aimed at inducing hypercholesterolemia (24Herrmann J. Gulati R. Napoli C. Woodrum J. Lerman L. Rodriguez-Porcel M. Sica V. Simari R. Ciechanover A. Lerman A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1730-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In these analyses (Fig. 1D; representative blot in the left panel and densitometric analysis from three experiments in the right panel), endothelial caveolin-1 protein levels were diminished in pigs with higher levels of serum cholesterol (serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, 9.5 ± 2.1 and 6.8 ± 1.7 mmol/liter) as compared with pigs with lower levels of serum cholesterol (serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, 2.2 ± 0.1 and 0.9 ± 0.2 mmol/liter; p < 0.05 compared with hypercholesterolemic pig levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol). These observations are qualitatively consistent with results obtained in BAEC exposed to varying levels of cholesterol.Sp1 Is Required for the Enhancer Effect of SREBP in Response to Cholesterol Depletion—Based on the prominent regulatory effect of cholesterol modulation on endogenous caveolin-1 expression, we used the caveolin-1 promoter as a model to characterize the role of SREBP, Sp1, and Sp1-like proteins in cholesterol-dependent gene regulation in endothelial type cells. For this purpose, ECV cells transfected with the caveolin-1 promoter were incubated with varying volume ratios of NHS and LPDS. As depicted in Fig. 2A, an increase in the volume ratio of LPDS to NHS incrementally induces caveolin-1 promoter activity. The cells incubated with 25% LPDS alone display a 3-fold up-regulation in the activity of this promoter. The specificity of the influence of cholesterol depletion on the caveolin-1 promoter was supported by demonstrating the lack of influence of cholesterol depletion on the empty pGL3 vector (Fig. 2B, left columns), as well as on a promoter not known to be regulated by cholesterol, Osf2/Cbfa1 (Fig. 2B, middle columns) (32Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3605) Google Scholar). Furthermore, supplementation of LDL cholesterol (0.05 and 0.1 mg/ml) to the LPDS cholesterol depletion medium abrogates the stimulatory influence of cholesterol depletion on caveolin-1 promoter activity, thereby resulting in activity levels similar to that observed with NHS (Fig. 2B, right columns).Fig. 2Cholesterol depletion potentiates caveolin-1 promoter activity. Cells were transfected with pGL3-cavFL and a Renilla luciferase vector and incubated with varying volume ratios of LPDS and NHS for 16 h. A, increasing volume ratios of LPDS to NHS were associated with increased caveolin-1 (Cav-1) promoter activity with a maximum detected increase of 3-fold. B, incubation of empty pGL3 transfected cells with 25% LPDS does not influence luciferase activity detected from cell lysates as compared with cells incubated with 25% NHS (left two columns). Luciferase activity from cells transfected with an irrelevant promoter, pGL3-Osf2/Cbfa1, which is not known to be regulated by cholesterol, was not influenced by incubation of cells with 25% LPDS as compared with 25% NHS (middle two columns). In cells transfected with pGL3-cavFL, supplementation of LDL cholesterol (0.05 and 0.1 mg/ml) to the LPDS medium entirely abrogates the stimulatory effects of LPDS, on caveolin-1 promoter activity (right two columns).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar to other genes regulated by cholesterol, the caveolin-1 promoter contains SRE-binding sites (17Bist A. Fielding P. Fielding C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10693-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We performed deletion analysis of the caveolin-1 promoter to dissect the importance of three SRE sites for cholesterol depletion-dependent activation of the caveolin-1 promoter. Constructs included SRE1/2 and SRE3, the former of which contains the first two SRE-like sites, at –646 to –637 and –395 to –386, and the latter of which contains the third SRE-like site at –287 to –278 (Fig. 3A, left panel). The cells were transfected for reporter assay with vectors encoding deletion constructs, SRE1/2 (pGL3-SRE1/2) or SRE3 (pGL3-SRE3), or the full-length promoter (pGL3-cavFL), or empty vector (pGL3) and incubated with NHS, LPDS, or LPDS with LDL supplementation (0.1 mg/ml). As depicted in Fig. 3A (right panel), cholesterol depletion conditions activated pGL3-SRE3 by 3-fold, a magnitude identical to the effect of cholesterol depletion on pGL3-cavFL, and LDL supplementation inhibited the activation event observed with these constructs. pGL3-SRE1/2 demonstrated minimal activity, indicating that the stimulatory influence of cholesterol depletion on caveolin-1 gene transcription is mediated through elements within the promoter region encoded within the pGL3-SRE3 promoter fragment.Fig. 3SREBP binding with an SRE near the caveolin-1 start site is responsible for caveolin-1 promoter activation in response to cholesterol depletion in"
https://openalex.org/W2022104801,"The related high molecular mass microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) MAP1A and MAP1B are predominantly expressed in the nervous system and are involved in axon guidance and synaptic function. MAP1B is implicated in fragile X mental retardation, giant axonal neuropathy, and ataxia type 1. We report the functional characterization of a novel member of the microtubule-associated protein 1 family, which we termed MAP1S (corresponding to sequence data bank entries for VCY2IP1 and C19ORF5). MAP1S contains the three hallmark domains of the microtubule-associated protein 1 family but hardly any additional sequences. It decorates neuronal microtubules and copurifies with tubulin from brain. MAP1S is synthesized as a precursor protein that is partially cleaved into heavy and light chains in a tissue-specific manner. Heavy and light chains interact to form the MAP1S complex. The light chain binds, bundles, and stabilizes microtubules and binds to actin. The heavy chain appears to regulate light chain activity. In contrast to MAP1A and MAP1B, MAP1S is expressed in a wide range of tissues in addition to neurons and represents the non-neuronal counterpart of this cytolinker family.

The classical microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HC, heavy chain; LC, light chain; MH, MAP1 homology; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; aa, amino acid(s); Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HC, heavy chain; LC, light chain; MH, MAP1 homology; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; aa, amino acid(s); Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin. MAP1, MAP2, and tau were discovered more than 20 years ago by virtue of the fact that they copurified with microtubules from vertebrate brain (1Schoenfeld T.A. Obar R.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 151: 67-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because of the developmental regulation of expression of these proteins, their restricted localization in the axonal or somato-dendritic compartment of neurons, and the differential phosphorylation depending on the developmental stage and subcellular localization, it was soon proposed that MAPs are important regulators of neuronal microtubules during differentiation.The MAP1 family has two members: MAP1A and MAP1B. Both proteins are of high molecular mass (∼300 kDa, 2500 aa), are expressed predominantly in the nervous system, and consist of several subunits, one heavy chain (HC) and at least one light chain (LC) (1Schoenfeld T.A. Obar R.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 151: 67-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In each case, heavy and light chains are the products of proteolytic cleavage of a common polyprotein precursor. MAP1A and MAP1B share three substantial regions of sequence homology (2Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Müller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one in the NH2 terminus of the heavy chains, one in the COOH terminus of the heavy chains, and one in the COOH-terminal half of the light chains. We termed these homologous hallmark domains of the MAP1 family MH1, MH2, and MH3, respectively. In MAP1B, the MH1 and MH3 domains mediate the interaction between heavy and light chains (3Tögel M. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and the MH3 domain of both proteins contains an actin binding site (4Noiges R. Eichinger R. Kutschera W. Fischer I. Németh Z. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAP1A and MAP1B are conserved in vertebrates. A MAP1 ortholog termed Futsch has been identified in Drosophila (5Hummel T. Krukkert K. Roos J. Davis G. Klämbt C. Neuron. 2000; 26: 357-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar).MAP1B function has been investigated by gene targeting in the mouse, and the original contention that it is important for neuronal differentiation and development of the nervous system has been confirmed (6Edelmann W. Zervas M. Costello P. Roback L. Fischer I. Hammarback J.A. Cowan N. Davies P. Wainer B. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mice homozygous for hypomorphic or null alleles of MAP1B display defects in axonal guidance, neuronal migration, axon diameter, and myelination. Work on cultured neurons from MAP1B mutant mice indicated that MAP1B contributes to neuronal differentiation and axon extension and guidance by regulating microtubule and actin dynamics in the growth cone (10Takei Y. Teng J. Harada A. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 11Gonzalez-Billault C. Avila J. Caceres A. Mol. Biol.

Together, these observations suggest that MAP1B and perhaps MAP1A regulate the cytoskeleton in response to extracellular guidance cues to permit axon extension and growth cone turning. This view is supported by the finding that changes in the activity of serine-threonine kinases casein kinase II, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 lead to altered MAP1B phosphorylation (13Ulloa L. Díaz-Nido J. Avila J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1633-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 14Pigino G. Paglini G. Ulloa L. Avila J. Cáceres A. J.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1351-1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by the fact that local inactivation of MAP1B on one side of the growth cone induces growth cone turning (16Mack T.G. Koester M.P. Pollerberg G.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is evidence that the function of MAP1B and perhaps MAP1A goes beyond regulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton. MAP1B interacts with and changes the ligand affinity of specific γ-amino butyric acid receptor subunits (17Hanley J.G. Koulen P. Bedford F. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Moss S.J. Nature. 1999; 397: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Billups D. Hanley J.G. Orme M. Attwell D. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8643-8650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is also evidence that a fraction of MAP1B is inserted in the axonal plasma membrane, with its extracellular domains binding to myelin-associated glycoprotein expressed on the surface of glial cells (19Franzen R. Tanner S.L. Dashiell S.M. Rottkamp C.A. Hammer J.A. Quarles R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Here we report the discovery and functional characterization of a third member of the MAP1 family encoded by the genomes of mouse, rat, and human that has thus far escaped detection. Because the novel MAP1 protein is unusually short compared with high molecular mass MAP1A and MAP1B, we propose to term it MAP1S.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA ConstructsAll amino acid numbering refers to the murine MAP1S protein sequence denoted in GenBank™ accession number AK032300. The full-length MAP1S cDNA encoding aa 1-973 was obtained by replacing a 693-base pair BstEII fragment of RIKEN clone ID 6430517J16 (GenBank™ accession number BB622636) with the corresponding fragment of IMAGE clone ID 4481035 (GenBank™ accession number BG261707). This was necessary because the RIKEN clone encoded a threonine instead of the wild-type proline at position 680. MAP1S-LC cDNA (aa 755-973) was obtained by PCR using primers 5′-GAGAATTCACGATGGTGGACCCGGAGGCG-3′ and 5′-ATACCTCGAGCTAGAACTCCACCTTGCAGG-3′. MAP1S Δ645-875 cDNA was obtained by deletion of the by BstEII fragment from full-length cDNA. A construct encoding the MH3 domain (human aa 935-1059 equivalent to murine aa 852-973) was obtained by PCR using clone DKFZp434G0516 (GenBank™ accession number AL041174) as template and primers 5′-GATCGAATTCCCCCGGCCCGGGGTGTCAGC-3′ and 5′-GATCGTCGACCTAGAACTCCACCTTGCAGG-3′. All constructs were fused in-frame to NH2- or COOH-terminal myc tags (aa sequence, EQKLISEEDLN) and cloned into the mammalian Tet-Off expression vector pUHD10-3 (20Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4226) Google Scholar). In addition, MAP1S-LC cDNA was cloned into a pET15b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) derivative for the expression of NH2-terminal His6-tagged protein in Escherichia coli. A fragment encoding the unique domain of the murine MAP1S heavy chain (aa 430-495) was amplified using primers 5′-GATAGGATCCCGCCTGCTGGATGGGCTACA-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCAGGCAGGCTCCCTTCGCACTG-3′, cut with BamHI and SalI, and cloned into the bacterial fusion vectors pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs) to obtain plasmids for the expression of GST and maltose-binding protein fusion proteins (GST-HC and maltose-binding protein-HC, respectively) in E. coli. The authenticity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing and/or reaction of encoded proteins with MAP1S-specific antisera.AntibodiesAnti-HC—Anti-HC was used at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml on immunoblots and at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays. GST-HC was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), solubilized by sonication in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 0.5-1% Triton X-100, including protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 mm benzamidine), purified over a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column, and used to immunize rabbits (Gramsch Laboratories, Schwabhausen, Germany). Antibodies were affinity-purified by column chromatography using maltose-binding protein-HC (purified from E. coli after sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA by amylose affinity chromatography) immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B.Anti-LC—Anti-LC was used at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml. The serum was raised in rabbits against the synthetic peptide CPLNTTNPSRSRKAPARP (MAP1S aa 768-784 linked to an NH2-terminal cysteine for convenient linkage to the affinity matrix; Gramsch Laboratories) and affinity-purified as described previously (3Tögel M. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Other Antibodies—Other antibodies used included anti-MAP1B light chain and anti-myc (1 μg/ml) (3Tögel M. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), anti-MAP1A light chain (1:1,000) (4Noiges R. Eichinger R. Kutschera W. Fischer I. Németh Z. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody B-5-1-2 (Sigma; 1:500), and anti-actin monoclonal antibody mix of AC-15 and AC-74 (Sigma; 1:200).Secondary Antibodies—Secondary antibodies used included alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse (1:7500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 488 and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes; 1:1000), and goat anti-mouse IgG Texas Red (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.; 1:200).Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of MAP1S ExpressionTotal RNA was extracted from 20-30 mg of tissue from 4-month-old C57BL/6J mice using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)12-18 and Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and subsequently amplified by PCR using primers 5′-ACGAATTCTGGTGGTGGGTGGCGAGTGTGG-3′ and 5′-ACGAATTCAACAGTGCCCAGTCCCCAAAGG-3′ and Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 μl of the reaction were analyzed on agarose gels.Protein AnalysisImmunoblot—Tissues from C57BL/6J mice were homogenized at 100 mg/ml in a buffer containing 8 m urea, 4% SDS, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12 mm EDTA, 0.3% dithiothreitol, 10 μm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm pepstatin, 2 μm aprotinin, 2 μm leupeptin, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue with a PT 3000 Kinematica homogenizer or by sonication. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were sonicated, centrifuged, and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. Aliquots were analyzed by immunoblotting (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Coimmunoprecipitation—Whole brains from 3-week-old C57BL/6J mice were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold TEN buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) with a motor-driven glass/Teflon homogenizer. All steps were carried out at 4 °C or on ice. After centrifugation, supernatants were precleared by incubation with 0.2 volume of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h. After centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 rpm, the supernatants were incubated overnight with anti-HC (1 μg/ml), anti-LC (1 μg/ml), or no antibodies (negative control), followed by an additional 3-h incubation with 0.2 volume of protein A-Sepharose. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm, washed three times with TEN buffer containing a freshly added protease inhibitor mixture, and eluted by boiling in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting.Purification of Microtubule Proteins and Cosedimentation AnalysisPurification of microtubules from 8-day-old C57BL/6J mice by assembly and disassembly cycles was performed as described previously (22Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar) using Pipes as a buffer system, and microtubules were tested for copurification of MAP1S by immunoblot. For in vitro cosedimentation, recombinant MAP1S light chain was expressed in E. coli BL21-Codon-Plus-RIL and purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+ columns according to the manufacturers' protocols (Novagen, Inc. and Qiagen) in the presence of 6 m urea, which was removed by dialysis before use in the respective assay. Cosedimentation with MAP-free bovine brain tubulin (#TL238; Cytoskeleton, Inc.) or rabbit skeletal muscle actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) was carried out as described previously (4Noiges R. Eichinger R. Kutschera W. Fischer I. Németh Z. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that 0.1% Tween and 2 mm dithiothreitol were added, and cosedimentation with actin was done in PEM buffer (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 2 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2). Equal volumes of supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunofluorescence Microscopy, and ImmunohistochemistryPtK2 cells and murine neuroblastoma N2a cells were grown as described previously (4Noiges R. Eichinger R. Kutschera W. Fischer I. Németh Z. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurite outgrowth was promoted by incubating N2a cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum supplemented with 0.3 mm dibutyryl-cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 h. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For immunofluorescence microscopy, PtK2 or N2a cells grown on glass coverslips were analyzed as described previously (4Noiges R. Eichinger R. Kutschera W. Fischer I. Németh Z. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, anesthetized mice were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Brains were dissected out, sliced sagittally, post-fixed for 1 day in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solutions at 4 °C overnight. After freezing in liquid nitrogen, serial coronal cryosections (5 μm) of the cerebellum were cut on a cryomicrotome, transferred onto chrome-alum-gelatin-coated glass slides, and dried overnight at room temperature. Slides were pretreated with Peroxidase Block (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) for 10 min, washed twice in PBS, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-HC, washed twice in PBS, and incubated in biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min, followed by two washes in PBS. Slides were then incubated in streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase (1:500; DAKO) for 30 min, washed twice in PBS, developed with diaminobenzidine DAB+ chromogen kit (DAKO) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and counterstained with hematoxylin. The slides were then dehydrated, mounted, and examined under a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using Axiovision software.RESULTSRodent and Human Genomes Encode One Additional Member of the MAP1 Family—The sequence comparison of MAP1A and MAP1B revealed that the two proteins share three extended regions of homology (2Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Müller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): one region of about 500 aa in the NH2 terminus of the heavy chains (MH1), one region in the COOH terminus of the heavy chains preceding the proteolytic cleavage site of the precursor (MH2; 120 aa), and one region in the COOH-terminal half of the light chains (MH3; 125 aa; Fig. 1). Using the amino acid sequence of MH3 in a BLAST search (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59092) Google Scholar) through available nucleic acid sequence databases, we identified numerous human, mouse, and rat cDNAs and expressed sequence tags. The majority of these sequences encoded either MAP1A or MAP1B MH3 domains. A third group of sequences showed consistent differences from either of the two known MAP1 proteins. Using these sequences in a renewed search on the nucleotide level, we identified full-length human and mouse cDNAs (representative GenBank™ accession numbers, for example, AJ440784 and AK032300, respectively) encoding a novel protein related to MAP1A and MAP1B that we termed MAP1S for reasons mentioned under “Introduction.” Analysis of human and mouse genomic sequences revealed that the MAP1S gene, like the genes for MAP1A and MAP1B, consists of seven exons and that exon-intron boundaries are conserved in MAP1A, MAP1B, and MAP1S. The considerable difference in size among the three proteins is due to differences in the length of internal sequences in exon 5, whereas the respective length of the other six exons is very similar or identical in all three genes. The MAP1S gene is located on human chromosome 19p13.12 (LocusID 55201) and on mouse chromosome 8 (LocusID 270058; MGI 2443304). No other MAP1-related genes or sequences were found, indicating that MAP1S is the only other member of the MAP1 family. A cDNA fragment encoding part of MAP1S has been identified previously in a yeast two-hybrid screen for potential interaction partners of the fibroblast growth factor-associated protein LRPPRC and was termed C19ORF5 (GenBank™ accession number XP_038600; Ref. 24Liu L. Amy V. Liu G. McKeehan W.L. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 2002; 38: 582-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In a similar search for potential interaction partners of a testicular protein of unknown function termed VCY2, the full-length cDNA of MAP1S was described (GenBank™ accession number AJ440784; Ref. 25Wong E.Y. Tse J.Y. Yao K.M. Lui V.C. Tam P.C. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Neither study provided data on the MAP1S protein, nor was the putative interaction with LRPPRC or VCY2 confirmed.The amino acid sequence comparison of MAP1S, MAP1B, and MAP1A revealed that MAP1S contains all three hallmark domains of the MAP1 family of proteins (Fig. 1). The MH1 domain appears to be the most highly conserved domain of the three proteins. In MH2 and MH3, MAP1A and MAP1B are more closely related to each other compared with MAP1S. Two additional short stretches of amino acid sequence homology between MAP1B and MAP1S that are not present in MAP1A were found at positions 1568-1592 in MAP1B corresponding to 615-639 in MAP1S (86% identity) and 2075-2090 in MAP1B corresponding to 663-678 in MAP1S (81% identity). Mouse and human MAP1S amino acid sequences are conserved at 63% identity, but the human protein contains an additional 86 aa encoded by several small insertions, the majority of which are located in human exon 5.MAP1S Is Widely Expressed in Mouse Tissues and Slightly Up-regulated during Postnatal Brain Development—Reverse transcription-PCR of a variety of mouse tissues showed that MAP1S mRNA was widely expressed and present in all tissues examined (Fig. 2A). As judged from this semiquantitative analysis, levels of expression were highest in testis, brain, heart, lung, and kidney, confirming an earlier report (25Wong E.Y. Tse J.Y. Yao K.M. Lui V.C. Tam P.C. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We obtained no evidence for alternative splicing by Northern blot analysis (a single 3.2-kb transcript was found; data not shown) or by comprehensive analysis of more than 250 human and mouse expressed sequence tag and cDNA sequences.Fig. 2MAP1S expression is widespread in mouse tissues. A, reverse transcription-PCR analysis was carried out on 5 μg of total RNA isolated from the indicated tissues of an adult male mouse using primers corresponding to sequences in exon 1 and 5, and aliquots corresponding to 0.1 μg of the original RNA sample were fractionated on an agarose gel. A single amplification product of the predicted size of 493 nucleotides was detected when the reaction was carried out in the presence (+), but not in the absence (-), of reverse transcriptase, demonstrating that the product was derived from RNA transcripts. sg, salivary gland. B, 120 μg of protein (total lysate) from the indicated mouse tissues (postnatal day 17) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an affinity-purified antibody against the heavy chain. Protein bands of 120 (corresponding to the uncleaved full-length MAP1S polyprotein precursor; MAP1S-FL) and 100 kDa (corresponding to the MAP1S heavy chain; MAP1S-HC) were detected in a number of mouse tissues. C, 50 μg of brain protein (total lysate) prepared at the indicated days after birth were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an affinity-purified antibody against the heavy chain, an anti-tubulin antibody (internal loading control), and antibodies directed against the MAP1A and MAP1B light chains. The positions of the MAP1S heavy chain (MAP1S-HC), the uncleaved precursor (MAP1S-FL), tubulin (tub), the MAP1B light chain (MAP1B-LC), and the MAP1A light chain (MAP1A-LC) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using a specific, affinity-purified antibody against the heavy chain of MAP1S termed anti-HC, we detected MAP1S protein expression in all mouse tissues examined (Fig. 2B; for specificity of the antibody, see Fig. 3). Remarkably, the heavy chain-specific antibody detected bands of 120 and 100 kDa that we subsequently showed to be the uncleaved full-length polyprotein precursor and the heavy chain, respectively (see Fig. 3B). MAP1S protein levels were highest in testis and brain. The amount of cleaved versus uncleaved form varied. In brain, the majority of the protein was cleaved. Heart, lung, and spleen expressed more of the uncleaved form, and in testis, kidney, and liver, the cleaved and uncleaved forms were found at approximately equal levels.Fig. 3MAP1S copurifies with microtubules and is partially cleaved into heavy and light chains. A, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis of total brain protein lysates (120 μg) demonstrating the specificity of anti-LC and anti-HC antibodies. In total lysates, anti-LC only detects the light chain at 26 kDa and does not detect the less abundant, uncleaved, full-length precursor. Anti-HC detects the heavy chain at 100 kDa as well as the precursor at 120 kDa. B, microtubules and associated proteins were purified and enriched from brain by two cycles of temperature-induced polymerization and depolymerization. Approximately 70 μg of polymerized tubulin and associated proteins from the second cycle of polymerization were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot using light chain-specific (anti-LC) or heavy chain-specific (anti-HC) antibodies. The MAP1S light chain (MAP1S-LC; 26 kDa), heavy chain (MAP1S-HC; 100 kDa), and the uncleaved polyprotein precursor reacting with both antibodies (MAP1S-FL; 120 kDa) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MAP1S expression during postnatal brain development was compared with the expression of MAP1A and MAP1B (Fig. 2C). In accordance with previously published reports, we found that the expression patterns of MAP1A and MAP1B were reciprocal: MAP1A is expressed at low levels at birth and then increases over the next 3 weeks, whereas MAP1B expression is high at birth, increases slightly over the next few days, and then drops to lower levels (1Schoenfeld T.A. Obar R.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 151: 67-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of MAP1S resembled that of MAP1A in that there is an increase in MAP1S levels during the postnatal period. However, unlike MAP1A, MAP1S levels were already high at birth.MAP1S Copurifies with Microtubules from Murine Brain and Is Partially Cleaved into Heavy and Light Chains—We next investigated whether MAP1S copurified with microtubules through repeated cycles of temperature-induced polymerization and depolymerization, as would be expected for a true MAP. For this analysis, we used anti-HC and anti-LC, two affinity-purified antibodies directed against unique amino acid sequences located in the presumptive heavy and light chains of MAP1S (Fig. 1). To demonstrate the specificity of these antibodies, we first conducted an immunoblot analysis of total brain homogenates (Fig. 3A). Anti-HC detected bands at 100 and 120 kDa, and anti-LC detected one band at 26 kDa. The 100-kDa band corresponds to the MAP1S heavy chain (calculated molecular mass, 80 kDa), and the 26-kDa band corresponds to the light chain (calculated molecular mass, 23 kDa). The identity of the remaining 120-kDa band became clear after copurification of MAP1S with microtubules from brain by temperature-dependent microtubule polymerization/depolymerization. After two cycles of polymerization, microtubule pellets contained MAP1S as revealed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3B). Treatment of the polymerized microtubules with a high concentration of salt (350 mm) led to the release of MAP1S from microtubules (data not shown), another feature reminiscent of the behavior of classical MAPs. In the immunoblot analysis, anti-HC again detected the band at 120 kDa and the heavy chain at 100 kDa, whereas anti-LC detected the light chain at 26 kDa and an additional band comigrating with the 120-kDa band detected by the heavy chain-specific antibody. This analysis identified the 120-kDa band as the uncleaved MAP1S polyprotein precursor (calculated molecular mass,"

Roles of distal Asp (Asp-136) residue in HmuO, a heme oxygenase of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, have been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme kinetics, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography.

Mammalian HO, which has been extensively studied, exists as two isoforms, a 33-kDa inducible HO-1 and a 36-kDa constitutive HO-2. Primary functions of HO-1 are excess heme catabolism and antioxidant defense, whereas that of HO-2 is proposed to generate CO that has been recognized as a physiological messenger molecule (2Yoshida T.

Higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria utilize α-biliverdin from their HO reactions for the synthesis of light-harvesting pigments (7Beale S.I. Cornejo J. Arch. Biochem.

Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6541-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In some pathogenic bacteria, HO degrades host heme so as to acquire iron required for their survival and proliferation (10Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhu W. Hunt D.J. Richardson A.R. Stojiljkovic I. J.

Despite the varied physiological functions, the heme degradation by HO proceeds through the same mechanism (Fig. 1). The three successive steps of O2 activation involving the uptake of a total of seven electrons is performed by the substrate heme itself as evident from the absence of any other cofactor in HO (3Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 543-549Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The first step of the HO reaction is the regiospecific hydroxylation of the porphyrin α-meso carbon atom. The resulting α-meso-hydroxyheme immediately reacts with another O2 to yield verdoheme and CO. Further O2 activation cleaves the heme macro cycle to afford biliverdin and free ferrous iron. Among the three distinct oxygenation steps, the first meso-hydroxylation is of particular interest due to its sharp contrast to O2 activation by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. The O2 activation both in HO and P450 is initiated by reduction of the ferric heme iron to the ferrous state, which allows rapid binding of O2 (Fig. 2). Further one-electron reduction and protonation of the ferrous-O2 complex yields a ferric hydroperoxy species (Fe—OOH). In P450 as well as peroxidase and catalase, the O—O bond of Fe—OOH is heterolytically cleaved to afford a reactive oxo ferryl heme. On the other hand, the Fe—OOH species in HO is now widely accepted as the hydroxylating reagent of the heme, and the ferryl heme is inactive in the porphyrin α-meso hydroxylation (14Ortiz de Wilks A. Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Davydov R.M. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10656-10657Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The terminal oxygen of Fe—OOH is supposed to attack the α-meso-carbon in HO rather than liberate as hydroxide (or more possibly as water) in P450. In comparison to the better characterized mechanism of the ferryl heme formation in P450 and peroxidase enzymes, little is known about how the HO enzyme enables the meso-hydroxylation by Fe—OOH. The crystal structure of the heme-HO complex reveals salient aspects of the architecture of the HO protein that appear to promote the meso-hydroxylation (16Schuller D.J. Ortiz de Wilks A. Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The heme group in HO is sandwiched between two helices termed as “proximal” and “distal” helices. The proximal helix contains an axial His ligand of heme, which is essentially neutral, as determined by spectroscopic measurements (17Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of ferryl heme should be less enhanced by the neutral His ligand in HO than a deprotonated His, histidinate, ligand in peroxidase (18Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The distal helix of HO, which is kinked above the heme plane around two conserved Gly residues (Gly-139 and Gly-143 in human HO-1), is in close contact with the heme group to sterically restrict access to all the meso positions except for the α-meso-carbon, leading to the α-regiospecificity of HO catalysis. The steric constraints imposed by the distal α-helix on the bound dioxygen direct the terminal oxygen atom of the ferrous-O2 complex toward the heme α-meso-carbon and makes its Fe—O—O angle acute (∼110°) to allow van der Waals contact of the terminal oxygen with the α-meso-carbon (19Takahashi S.

The unique structure of the distal helix should be critical in promoting meso-hydroxylation by Fe—OOH because replacement of either of the two Gly diminishes the HO activity with partial formation of the ferryl species (21Liu Y. Koenigs Lightning L. Huang H. Moenne-Loccoz P. Schuller D.J. Poulos T.L. Ortiz de Loehr T.M. Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34501-34507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Further mutational studies on polar residues in the distal helix of HO-1 have uncovered another critical residue, Asp-140, whose replacement leads to dominant formation of the inactive ferryl heme (22Fujii H. Zhang X. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6475-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Lightning L.K. Huang H. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Schuller D.J.

The distal Asp is located ∼8 Å from the heme iron but forms an H-bond network to an iron-bound water ligand through an intervening water molecule(s). Because this distal Asp mutation is not expected to disrupt the distal helix structure, it has been proposed that Asp-140, its carboxylate moiety in particular, is crucial in activation of Fe—OOH through the intervening water molecules. The distal Asp is highly conserved in most mammalian, plant, and bacterial HOs. However, two bacterial HOs, HemO from Neisseria meningitidis and PigA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2Regiospecificity of heme degradation of PigA is different because it mainly generates the δ-biliverdin isomer rather than the α-isomer of biliverdin afforded by most HOs (34Caignan G.A. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Zeng Y. Huang H.W. Moenne-Loccoz P. Bunce R.A. Eastman M.A. Rivera M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14879-14892Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). lack this distal Asp. The absence of a carboxyl residue in their distal heme pockets has been confirmed in the crystal structures of HemO and PigA (24Schuller D.J. Zhu W. Stojiljkovic I. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11552-11558Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Friedman J. Lad L. Li H. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5239-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of the distal Asp residue, both HemO and PigA utilize Fe—OOH in hydroxylation of the heme meso-carbon to form meso-hydroxyheme as mammalian HO-1 (25Friedman J. Lad L. Li H. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5239-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Friedman J. Lad L. Deshmukh R. Li H. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. J. Biol.

These findings have raised questions about the general importance of the distal Asp carboxylate proposed for mammalian HO-1, and thus, a reassessment is needed to accurately delineate how Fe—OOH hydroxylates the heme meso-carbon. To this end, a series of distal Asp (Asp-136) mutants of HO from Corynebacterium diphtheriae (HmuO) have been characterized by enzymatic reaction, resonance Raman scattering, and x-ray crystallography. HmuO, a 24-kDa soluble HO, is one of the most structurally and enzymatically best characterized bacterial HOs (10Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28Chu G.C.

Despite its low sequence identity to human HO-1 (33%), the crystal structure of HmuO reveals a distal Asp conserved at a position similar to that in HO-1 (29Hirotsu S. Chu G.C. Unno M. Lee D.S.

Chem. 2003; 279: 11937-11947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), thereby offering an opportunity for us to examine whether the carboxylate of the distal Asp residue is significant in HO catalysis. We have found that the distal Asp of HmuO is critical in positioning a distal pocket water molecule at the vicinity of Fe—OOH and that this nearby water can promote heme meso-hydroxylation by Fe—OOH without help by the distal Asp carboxylate. Our results suggest a universal, water-driven activation mechanism of Fe—OOH for all the HO enzymes including HemO and PigA. Construction of Expression Plasmids of Asp-136 Mutants of HmuO— Construction of pMW-HmuO, the synthetic expression plasmid for HmuO wild type, was described elsewhere (28Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The full-length synthetic hmuO gene was designed with unique restriction sites convenient for cassette mutagenesis. To synthesize the expression plasmid of Asp-136 mutants, the wild type pMW-HmuO was excised with SpeI and MscI, and the resulting larger fragment of the digests was gel-purified. A synthetic 47-residue nucleotide, 5′-CTAGTTGCTCACCACTACGTACGCTACCTCGGTGCCCTCTCGGGTGG-3′, and its complementary 43-residue nucleotide, 5′-CCACCCGAGAGGGCACCGAGGTAGCGTACGTAGTGGTGAGCAA-3′, both containing the sense and antisense codon for Ala136, respectively, as indicated by the underlined bases, were annealed to make a double-stranded DNA. This double-stranded DNA was ligated to the larger SpeI/MscI fragment to form pMW-HmuO D136A. Expression plasmids of other Asp-136 mutants were constructed in the same way except for codons corresponding to the residues 136, AAT (Asn), GAA (Glu), and TTC (Phe). All final coding sequences of these mutant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Sawady). Protein Expression, Purification and Reconstitution with Heme— Escherichia coli expression and purification of the HmuO mutant proteins, except D136F HmuO were carried out as described previously (28Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). D136F was expressed in inclusion bodies, different from the other mutants that were expressed in the soluble form. Using BL21(DE3)pLysS and mild induction with 30 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C increased the soluble form more than half of the total D136F HmuO protein expressed. All the purified proteins were homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Heme reconstitution of each purified HmuO mutant was performed as described previously (28Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Note that the Asp-136 mutants, especially D136F, required longer incubation with ferric heme for proper reconstitution than the wild type. The heme complexes of the purified proteins were stored at -80 °C until use. Spectroscopic Measurements—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer at 20 °C. Resonance Raman spectra were obtained with the 413.1-nm line of a krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics) or 441.6-nm line of a helium-cadmium laser (Kinmon Electronics). Raman spectra were detected with a CCD camera attached to a single polychromator (Ritsu Oyokogaku, DG-1000). The Fe—N—O vibrations, ν(Fe—NO), δ(Fe—N—O), and ν(N—O), were determined by isotope-sensitive Raman lines of the NO-bound ferrous heme-wild type HmuO complex prepared with 14N16O, 14N18O, 15N16O, and 15N18O gases. To avoid photoreactions, the laser power was tuned at 2-10 millwatts, and the accumulation time was 5 min. Raman spectra were calibrated with indene and CCl4, and the spectral accuracy was within ±1 cm-1. H2O2-supported Reactions—All the reactions with H2O2 were performed at 20 °C in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. To 1 ml of solution of ∼5 μm ferric heme-HmuO complex was added varied amount of H2O2. Product ratios of verdoheme and ferryl heme were estimated from the absorbance increase at 680 nm in the absence and presence of o-cresol. At this wavelength, absorption of the ferric and ferryl heme is negligible, so that the amount of verdoheme formed can be determined. o-Cresol does not react with verdoheme but immediately reduces the ferryl heme to the ferric state. Multiple turnovers of the ferric heme with H2O2 resulted in almost complete formation of verdoheme even in D136F HmuO. Reaction rates with H2O2 were determined by using a UNISOKU RSP-601 stopped-flow apparatus equipped with a built-in rapid scan spectrophotometer at 20 °C. Typically, 5 μm ferric enzymes were mixed with equal volumes of H2O2 solution (0.5-10 mm). Absorbance decay at 404 nm was well fitted to a single exponential function. Linear relationships of the observed reaction rates with concentrations of H2O2 indicate that the H2O2 binding to the heme iron is involved in a rate-determining step, and their slopes give apparent reaction rate constants (kapp). The kapp values are summations of formation rates of the verdoheme (k1) and ferryl heme (k2), and ratios of k1 to k2 are equal to the product ratios of verdoheme to ferryl heme (Equations 1, 2, 3, 4). The k1 and k2 values, thus, can be calculated from kapp and the product ratios. Ferric heme+H2O2k1→verdoheme(Eq. 1) Ferric heme+H2O2k2→ferryl heme(Eq. 2) kapp=k1+k2(Eq. 3) k1k2=[verdoheme][ferryl heme](Eq. 4) Cytochrome P-450 Reductase (CPR)-supported Reactions—All the reactions supported by CPR were performed at 20 °C in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.0. To 1 ml of solution of 3 μm ferric heme-HmuO complex and NADPH was added CPR (final concentration, 0.1 μm). Absorption spectra were recorded until NADPH was completely consumed. X-ray Crystallography—Ferric heme complexes of D136E, D136N, and D136A HmuO formed crystals suitable for high resolution x-ray structural analysis under conditions similar to those used for the heme complex of wild type HmuO (29Hirotsu S. Chu G.C. Unno M. Lee D.S. Yoshida T. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 11937-11947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins were concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml (D136E and D136N) or 10 mg/ml (D136A) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. D136E crystals were grown at 20 °C by a hanging drop vapor diffusion method from a solution mixed with an equal volume of the protein stock solution and a reservoir solution containing 50 mm MES (pH 6.1), 2.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.23 m sodium iodide, and 0.1% dioxane. For the D136N mutant, the reservoir solution contained additional 8.8% glycerol. D136A crystals were grown at 20 °C by a hanging drop method with mother solution similar to that used for wild type HmuO. Any attempts to crystallize D136F HmuO have not been successful due to its denaturation during crystallization. Although D136F HmuO was stable at -80 °C, its high spin ferric heme even on ice and without precipitation solution was converted to a low spin species in a few days. The low spin form of D136F HmuO easily aggregated upon the addition of ∼1 m ammonium sulfate. Diffraction data for D136E were collected at 95 K on an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector using 0.98 Å synchrotron radiation at BL6A of Photon Factory, and those for D136N and D136A mutants were collected at 95 K on an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector using 1.00 Å synchrotron radiation at NW12 of Photon Factory-Advanced Ring. Data were integrated, merged, and processed with HKL2000 (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar).

Coordination Structures of Hemes in HmuO—The distal Asp of HmuO (Asp-136) has been replaced by Glu, Asn, Ala, and Phe. The Asp-136 mutants of HmuO have been expressed in E. coli, purified, and reconstituted with ferric heme by a slight modification of a method described for the wild type protein (35Chu G.C. Tomita T. Sonnichsen F.D. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24490-24496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ferric heme iron of wild type HmuO is in a hexacoordinate high spin state with His and water axial ligands at neutral pH (28Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

Absorption maxima of the ferric Asp-136 mutants are centered around 404, 500, and 630 nm, essentially identical to those of the wild type (Table I). Resonance Raman spectra of the ferric mutants as well as the wild type exhibit their ν2 and ν3 vibration modes at 1563 and 1482 cm-1, respectively (Fig. 3), indicating hexacoordinate high spin states for all the ferric hemes. Also in ferrous and ferrous-CO forms, spectroscopic features are essentially the same among the wild type and Asp-136 mutants (data not shown). In addition, all the ferrous heme-enzyme complexes show their Fe2+-proximal Hisstretching modes at the same frequency (Table I). These results clearly indicate that the Asp-136 substitutions in HmuO do not alter the primary coordination sphere of the heme group both in the ferric and ferrous states.Table IAbsorption maxima and Fe—His stretching modes of HmuOHmuOλmax(Fe3+)ν(Fe2+-His)nmcm-1Wild type404, 500, 630223D136E404, 499, 630223D136N405, 500, 630223D136A405, 501, 631223D136F405, 500, 631223 Open table in a new tab Reaction with Hydrogen Peroxide—Effects of the Asp-136 substitutions on the first step of the heme degradation were examined in H2O2-dependent reactions (Fig. 4). It has been reported that H2O2 supports the first oxygenation of ferric heme to yield α-meso-hydroxyheme, which is immediately converted to verdoheme IXα in the presence of O2 (14Ortiz de Wilks A. Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4a, aerobic incubation of ferric wild type HmuO and H2O2 caused a decrease in the Soret band and concomitant appearance of a broad absorption band centered at 680 nm, typical for verdoheme formation. On the contrary, the Soret peak of ferric D136F HmuO rapidly shifted to 412 nm with the appearance of prominent visible bands at 526 and 549 nm (Fig. 4b). Verdoheme is a minor product in the D136F mutant as judged by the appearance of only a small band around 680 nm. The major product looks like an oxo ferryl heme (Fe4+=O), which was confirmed by regeneration of the starting ferric heme by the addition of electron donors such as o-cresol. The ferryl heme is not capable for the heme meso-hydroxylation and is also observed in the H2O2 reaction of distal Asp mutants of mammalian HO-1 (14Ortiz de Wilks A. Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fujii H. Zhang X. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10612-10619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the distal Asp in HmuO is crucial for the proper heme degradation as in mammalian HO-1. The distal Asp is likely to enhance meso-hydroxylation by a ferric hydroperoxy-heme complex (Fe—OOH), which is a common intermediate for the formation of verdoheme and ferryl heme (Fig. 2). Reactions of other ferric Asp-136 mutants with H2O2 also gave mixtures of verdoheme and ferryl heme with varied product ratios (Table II). The verdoheme ratio (% verdoheme) was highest in wild type HmuO, indicating Asp as the best residue for the meso-hydroxylation. Because the D136N substitution (Fig. 4c) as well as D136E does not significantly suppress the verdoheme formation, the carboxylate moiety of distal Asp does not seem to be required for the HmuO catalysis. On the other hand, D136A HmuO (Fig. 4d) afforded an approximately equimolar mixture of the two products, and Phe-136 most effectively hampered the proper heme degradation. Thus, high polarity and/or H-bonding ability of a residue at position 136 appear to facilitate the meso-hydroxylation. These results are in contrast to the previous proposal for mammalian HO-1 that the distal Asp (Asp-140) carboxylate is indispensable for the heme meso-hydroxylation (22Fujii H. Zhang X. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6475-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Lightning L.K. Huang H. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Schuller D.J. Ortiz de Poulos T.L.

The distal Asp mutations in rat HO-1 compared with HmuO have much more drastic effects on the H2O2-supported reactions: Verdoheme ratios are roughly estimated to be 100% for wild type and D140E, 20% for D140N, and 0% for D140A and D140F HO-1. The major difference compared with the HmuO mutants is dominant formation of the ferryl heme species in D140N and D140A HO-1.Table IIProduct and kinetic analysis of the reaction of HmuO with H2O2HmuO% Verdohemea% Verdoheme = 100 × [verdoheme]/([verdoheme] + [ferryl heme])kappk1k2mm-1s-1mm-1s-1mm-1s-1Wild type850.0200.0170.003D136E790.0800.0630.017D136N740.500.370.13D136A494.52.22.3D136F186.61.25.4a % Verdoheme = 100 × [verdoheme]/([verdoheme] + [ferryl heme]) Open table in a new tab The Asp-136 substitutions affect not only the product distribution of the H2O2 reactions but also reactivity of the heme-HmuO complex with H2O2 (Table II). Observed reaction rates linearly depend on the H2O2 concentration, suggesting the H2O2 binding to the heme iron as a major rate-determining step. Table II summarizes apparent rate constants (kapp) and individual formation rates of the verdoheme (k1) and ferryl heme (k2) derived from Equations 1, 2, 3. Inspection of Table II reveals that as the verdoheme ratio (% verdoheme) decreases in the Asp-136 mutants, the kapp value significantly increases (up to 330-fold increase for D136F HmuO). The higher reactivity of the Asp-136 mutants can be attributed to the facile H2O2 binding to the heme iron, which is consistent with simultaneous increase in k1 and k2 (Table II). These results imply that the Asp-136 substitutions make the heme iron more accessible for H2O2. The more pronounced increase in k2 than k1 would be due to preferred conversion of Fe—OOH to ferryl heme rather than verdoheme. Heme Degradation by Reductive Activation of Molecular Oxygen—Although a physiological electron donor of HmuO is yet to be identified, mammalian NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase (CPR) is known to support the heme degradation by the bacterial enzyme (27Wilks A.

https://openalex.org/W1969415733,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are accompanied by the recruitment of microglial cells in the vicinity of amyloid aggregates of the pathological prion protein (PrPres). We previously showed that PrPres itself triggered the recruitment of microglia by interacting with neurons leading to the up-regulation of the expression level of chemokines, mainly RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted). The intracellular mechanisms underlying the PrPres-inducible expression of chemokines in this setting are not clear. Here we demonstrate that the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is switched on shortly after PrPres exposure to neurons leading to the expression of early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1), a transcription factor initially linked to differentiation and growth and to up-regulation of RANTES mRNA expression. PD98059, a selective inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 activation, resulted in a decrease of RANTES mRNA expression and as a consequence to the lowering of microglial cell migration. Neuronal overexpression of Nab2, a corepressor of Egr-1, produced similar effects. PrPres-induced chemoattraction is independent of the presence of PrPc and the laminin receptor on the neuronal cell surface.

Intraneuronal vacuolization, severe neuronal cell death, astrogliosis, and microglia activation are the main hallmarks of TSEs (1Chesebro B. Med Bull. 2003; 66: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, TSEs are characterized by progressive cerebral accumulation of a misfolded protease-resistant isoform (PrPres) of the host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPc). No amino acid sequence or posttranslational differences have been detected between the normal PrPc and its pathological PrPres isoform (2Hope J. Morton L.J.D. Farquhar C.F. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Kimberlin R.H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2591-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The molecular changes resulting in the formation of amyloid aggregates of PrPres have been extensively studied in vitro as well as in vivo. The PrPres fibril growth is thought to occur by binding of PrPc molecules followed by their conversion into a conformation physicochemically undistinguishable to PrPres (3Horiuchi M. Priola S.A. Chabry J. Caughey B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5836-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Conformational changes involved in the conversion step result in a lowering in α-helical content and an important increase of the β-sheet structures (4Pan K-M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar, 5Safar J.

For decades, TSEs have been widely regarded as infectious diseases lacking inflammatory component (6Porter D.D. Porter H.G. Cox N.A. J. Immunol. 1973; 111: 1407-1410PubMed Google Scholar). However, the accumulation of PrPres is correlated with the appearance of reactive microglia and astrocytes concomitantly with neuronal cell loss (7Miyazono M. Iwaki T. Kitamoto T. Kaneko Y. Doh-ura K. Tateishi J. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 589-598PubMed Google Scholar, 8Muhleisen H. Gehrmann J. Meyermann R. Neuropathol. Appl.

Because they are frequently present in the vicinity of PrPres aggregates, activated microglial cells could play an important role in brain damages (10Guiroy D.C. Wakayama I. Liberski P.P. Gajdusek D.C. Acta Neuropathol. 1994; 87: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Williams A. Lucassen P.J. Ritchie D. Bruce M. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 144: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Growing evidence support the hypothesis that the recruitment of microglia may be one of the early steps of TSEs pathogenesis. Activated microglia release various factors such as cytokines and free radicals that regulate neuronal and glial survival (12Zielasek J. Hartung H.P. Adv. Neuroimmunol. 1996; 6: 191-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide release by microglia is thought to be responsible, at least in part, to neuronal cell death likely via the induction of apoptotic pathways (13von Brune B. Knethen A. Sandau K.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 351: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Alternatively, microglial cells might assume other roles including a carrier for the TSE infectious agent participating to the spread of the disease throughout the brain (14Baker C.A. Lu Z.Y. Zaitsev I. Manuelidis L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5089-5097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Baker C.A. Martin D. Manuelidis L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10905-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The involvement of microglial cells is well described in TSEs as well as in a variety of other neurodegenerative disorders (for review, see Ref. 16Brown D.R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 54: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recruitment and correct positioning of microglia in the vicinity of cerebral lesions are under control of chemokines acting through the activation of specific G-protein-coupled receptors (17Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Expression levels of a broad spectrum V of chemokines and chemokine receptors undergo variations in the course of TSE infection development (18Hughes P.M. Botham M.S. Frentzel S. Mir A. Perry V.H. Glia. 2002; 37: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 19Baker C.A. Manuelidis L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that PrPres triggers the recruitment of microglial cells by interacting with neurons and up-regulating the mRNA expression level of the chemokine RANTES (20Marella M. Chabry J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 34: 620-627Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our data strongly suggested the existence of functional interactions between PrPres and the neuronal cell surface that might activate transduction signal pathways leading to the up-regulation of RANTES expression. Prion synthetic fragment 106-126 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)-dependent inflammatory signal transduction cascades in monocytic cell line (21Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Cannady S.B. Lehman T.M. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 928-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the MAP kinase pathway is activated in vulnerable neurons in patients with Alzheimer's disease raising the possibility of an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (22Zhu X. Lee H.G. Raina A.K. Perry G. Smith M.A. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The major aim of the present study was to characterize the PrPres-induced signaling pathways in neurons involved in the microglial cell recruitment. We identified a MAP kinase-dependent signaling cascade in primary cultured neurons that is activated within minutes after exposure to PrPres and is directly responsible for RANTES expression. PrPres provokes the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), members of the MAP kinases family (23Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), independently of the presence of both PrPc and laminin receptors, the putative PrPres receptors on neurons (19Baker C.A. Manuelidis L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 22Zhu X. Lee H.G. Raina A.K. Perry G. Smith M.A. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Specific inhibition of kinases and transcription factors within the PrPres-mediated activation pathway prevents microglia migration and could offer novel strategies for TSEs treatment. Materials—Opti-MEM, serum-free medium Neurobasal, B27 supplement, G418, and penicillin-streptomycin mixture were purchased from Invitrogen. RPMI 1640 medium, l-glutamine, and fetal calf serum were purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) from Roche Applied Science.

Chabry J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 34: 620-627Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Dissociated cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells in 12-well and 5 × 105 in 24-well tissue plastic dishes, precoated with polylysine (10 μg/ml). Cells were grown for 24 h in Neurobasal supplemented with B27 and 10% inactivated fetal calf serum, then the medium was replaced with fresh Neurobasal/B27 mixture. GFP-expressing adenovirus infections of neurons were performed by adding to the Neurobasal/B27 mixture, 5 or 15 μl of adenoviruses preparation at 3 multiplicity of infection(m.o.i.)/μl/1 × 106 neuronal cells. In these conditions, no neurotoxicity was observed (data not shown). Cultures were pure of neurons up to 98% and used after 4-5 days of differentiation. The N11 microglial cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 2 mml-glutamine. Neuroblastoma cells chronically infected with the murine Chandler strain (N2asc+) were grown in Opti-MEM supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml G418. As described previously (28Nishida N. Harris D.A. Vilette D. Laude H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Casanova D. Milhavet O. Lehmann S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), PrPres-cured neuroblastoma cells (N2asc-) were obtained by treatment with Congo Red (1 μg/ml) for several passages of the cells. All cell cultures were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. N2asc+ homogenate preparations (hgtsc+), used as source of PrPres, were obtained in detergent-free conditions, mainly consisting of one purification step using proteinase K digestion as previously described (20Marella M. Chabry J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 34: 620-627Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Typically, the preparation was pure in PrPres up to >75%, and its concentration was about 20 pg/μl, as estimated by silver staining and Western blot analyses on SDS-PAGE. N2asc- homogenate preparations (hgtsc-) performed in the same conditions are PrPres-free and were used as a negative control in all the experiments. Microglial Cell Migration Assays—Four-day-old cortical neurons (5 × 105 cells/well) plated in 24 wells of the Boyden's chamber were incubated with 5 μl of PBS, hgtsc-, or hgtsc+ (i.e. ∼100 pg of PrPres) for 24 h at 37 °C. Mouse microglial cells N11 were added on the top chamber of the Boyden's chamber (5 × 104 cells in 200 μl) and allowed to migrate through polyester filters (pore size, 8 μm; Falcon) for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells remaining in the upper surface of the filter were delicately removed with a cotton swab, whereas migrating cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and stained for 10 min at room temperature with 0.5% crystal violet in PBS plus 10% methanol. Filters were mounted on glass slides, and stained cells were counted (5 random fields/filter) under an inverted microscope. Statistical analysis between each experimental condition was made from the number of filters (n = 6) by using the Student's t test. Differences were considered significant for p < 0.01. Western Blot Analyses—Neurons (1 × 106 cells/well) were preincubated in presence or in absence of PD98059 (25 μm) for 2 h then treated with 10 μl of PBS (0), hgtsc-, or hgtsc+ at 37 °C for the indicated times. Then, cells were washed in PBS and then lysed in 180 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μm NaF, and complete mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Identical amounts of total cell-solubilized proteins (∼40 μg) were analyzed on SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to immunoblotting using antibodies directed against early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1) protein or the active phosphorylated forms of Erk1/2 or Elk-1. Blots were revealed using an enhanced chemoluminescence system (Pierce) and exposed on x-rays film (X-Omat AR, Kodak). To ensure equal loading of proteins in each lane, the same blots were reprobed with the total anti-Erk1/2 antibodies. Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction—mRNAs were prepared using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi W. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment with DNase I, 0.5 μg of mRNA were reverse-transcribed with M-MLV reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed in an ABI PRISM 5700 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems) using the SYBR Green detection protocol as outlined by the manufacturer. RANTES gene-specific primers were designed using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). The relative expression level of the RANTES gene was normalized for RNA concentrations with four different housekeeping genes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, β-actin, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, and ubiquitin). Confocal Microscopy Experiments—Primary cultures of mouse neurons were grown on glass coverslips in the appropriated medium for 24 h at 37 °C and then infected with adGFP and adGFP-Nab2 as described above. Three days post-infection, coverslips were washed twice with PBS and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol for confocal microscopy examination. Cells were analyzed using a laser scanning confocal inverted microscope (Leica, Nussloch, Germany) equipped with an argon-krypton laser. The samples were scanned under 488 excitation wavelength. The images were acquired as single transcellular optical sections and averaged over at least 4 scans/frame. Neurons Trigger Microglia Migration in Response to PrPres Exposure by Activation of a MAP Kinase/Erk1/2 Signaling Pathway Independently of the PrPc Expression—We previously demonstrated that neurons respond to PrPres exposure by up-regulating the expression of the chemokine RANTES leading to the recruitment of microglial cells (20Marella M. Chabry J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 34: 620-627Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This study strongly suggested the existence of specific interactions between PrPres and putative receptors on the cell surface and the subsequent induction of transduction signal pathways. Based on specific binding observed in vitro between PrPres and PrPc (3Horiuchi M. Priola S.A. Chabry J. Caughey B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5836-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or PrPres and laminin receptor (30Rieger R. Edenhofer F. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) both proteins might act as cellular PrPres receptors. To investigate the role of PrPc expression in the PrPres-induced chemotactism mechanism, in vitro microglial cell migration assays were performed in the presence of wild-type or PrP-depleted cortical neurons. Cultured neurons from wild-type or PrP0/0 mice grown in the Boyden bottom chamber were incubated in the presence of PBS, hgtsc-, or hgtsc+ for 24 h, and then the microglial cells plated in the top insert of the chamber were allowed to migrate for 6 h at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). In the presence of hgtsc+, the level of migrating cell was increased by 3.3-fold when compared with PBS and hgtsc- conditions. The rate of microglia migration was similar when assays were performed with wild-type and PrP0/0 neurons suggesting that the PrPres-induced chemotactism was independent of the presence of PrPc on the neuronal cell surface. To test whether the PrPres-induced microglia migration was mediated though the binding to the laminin receptor; in vitro cell migration assay was performed in the presence of saturated concentration of a neutralizing laminin receptor antibody (∼40 μg/ml, Ref. 26Gauczynski S. Peyrin J. Haik S. Leucht C. Hundt C. Rieger R. Krasemann S. Deslys J. Dormont D. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5863-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In these conditions, no cell migration change was measured in the presence of the antibody suggesting that the laminin receptor is not involved in the PrPres-induced chemotactism. No significant effect on N11 cell migration was observed in the presence of hgtsc- when compared with PBS-treated cells. Hgtsc- stimulation experiments can be considered the basal unregulated cell migration rate. To establish whether PrPres-induced chemotactism is dependent on the involvement of the MAP kinase signaling pathway, cell migration assays were performed by pre-incubating wild-type neurons in the presence of the MEK-specific inhibitor, PD98059 (31Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar) prior to the induction of microglia migration by hgtsc+. As shown in Fig. 1B, the addition of 25 μm PD98059 in the incubation medium provoked a ∼40% decrease in the rate of microglia migration. Because we identified RANTES as the main neuronal chemokine involved in the PrPres-induced chemotactism (20Marella M. Chabry J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 34: 620-627Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we assessed the possible involvement of the MAP kinase cascade in the up-regulation of RANTES mRNAs. PD98059-treated or non-treated neurons were stimulated with 5 μl of hgtsc- or hgtsc+; then RANTES mRNAs were quantified by using a real time PCR assay (Fig. 1C). RANTES mRNA expression was highly up-regulated following hgtsc+ stimulation in comparison to the PBS or hgtsc- treatments. A 66% decrease in the RANTES mRNA levels was measured from hgtsc+-stimulated neurons pretreated with PD98059 compared with the non-treated cells suggesting that the RANTES mRNA expression is under the control of MAP kinases activation. To confirm that PrPres exposure on neurons activates the MAP kinase signaling pathway, neurons were incubated in the absence (t = 0) or in the presence of hgtsc- or hgtsc+ for various times. Then, Western blot analyses were performed on cell lysates to detect phosphorylated i.e. activated forms of mitogen-activated kinases Erk1/2 (Fig. 2). Hgtsc+ rapidly and transiently stimulated the phosphorylation of MAP kinases Erk1/2 in neurons with a maximal effect after 2.5 min that was maintained up to 5 min to finally recover the basal level after 10 min (Fig. 2A). Standardization of the same blots using the anti-total Erk1/2 antibodies indicated a maximal 1.8-2-fold stimulation of p-Erk at 2.5 min (Fig. 2B). As expected, the p-Erk1/2 immunoreactivity level was not modified when neurons were incubated with hgtsc- (Fig. 2A) or with hgtsc+ in the presence of 25 μm PD98059 (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, PD98059 that seems to lead to a complete inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway as shown by Western blot analyses (Fig. 2C), gives only a partial inhibition of RANTES mRNA expression and microglia migration (Fig. 1, B and C). This discrepancy could be explained by the fact that primary cultures contain astrocytes (2-4%) and heterogeneous neurons in terms of differentiation stages and brain areas origin. We cannot rule out the fact that astrocytes and a minor part of neurons respond to PrPres exposure in a MAP kinase pathway-independent manner (20Marella M. Chabry J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 34: 620-627Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In summary, our data strongly suggest that PrPres stimulates the MAP signaling pathway leading to the up-regulation of chemokine levels and the subsequent microglia recruitment in a way that does not require the presence of PrPc or the laminin receptor.Fig. 2Effect of PrPres exposure on MAP kinases ERK1/2 phosphorylation in primary cultures of neurons.A, four-day-old cortical neurons were stimulated with 10 μl of hgtsc- or hgtsc+ for 0 (unstimulated)-60 min at 37 °C. The phosphorylation of MAP kinases (p-Erk1/2) was determined by immunoblotting using an antibody directed against the phosphorylated active form of Erk1/2. The same blots were subsequently reprobed with anti-total Erk proteins to ensure equal loading of samples. B, data were standardized from three different experiments using the labeling obtained on the same blot with the anti-total Erk antibody and expressed as means ± S.D. C, cultures of neurons were pre-incubated with 25 μm PD98059 for 2 h before being exposed to 10 μl of hgtsc+ for the indicated times. Immunoblots shown in A and C are representative of typical experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Regulation of Elk-1 Phosphorylation and Egr-1 Expression in PrPres-exposed Neurons—Transcription factor Elk-1 is the main target of activated p-Erk1/2 (32Cohen D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11242-11247Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because the expression of early gene transcription factor Egr-1 is dependent on Elk-1 activation (33Thiel G. Cibelli G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), we investigated whether PrPres induces the phosphorylation (i.e. activation) of Elk-1 and Egr-1 expression in neurons in a MAP kinase-dependent manner. PD98059-treated or untreated neurons were stimulated with 10 μl of hgtsc+ for different times; total proteins from neuronal cell lysates were then submitted to Western blot analysis for p-Elk and Egr-1 detection (Fig. 3). Whereas p-Elk was barely detectable in the absence of PrPres exposure (t = 0), its level increased significantly as a function of hgtsc+ incubation time (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, in the same experimental conditions, Egr-1 expression was up-regulated and reached its maximal value around 60-90 min (Fig. 3B). As expected, in the presence of PD98059 in the incubation medium, neither p-Elk nor Egr-1 immunoreactivity was observed. These results demonstrated that soon after PrPres exposure on the neurons, Elk is activated by phosphorylation leading to the expression of Egr-1, its early gene transcription factor target, in a MAP kinase-dependent pathway. Because Egr-1-mediated transcription is negatively controlled by a specific corepressor, Nab2 (34Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of the neuronal overexpression of Nab2 on the PrPres-induced microglia migration. First, we estimated the percent of fluorescent neurons 2 days post-infection with adenovirus expressing GFP-Nab2 at 15 and 45 m.o.i. (Fig. 4A). We observed an increase in the number of fluorescent neurons with higher concentrations of adGFP-Nab2 used for the infection (15 m.o.i., 70 ± 5%; 45 m.o.i., 90 ± 4%). In the course of these adenovirus infection experiments, neither significant neuronal cell death nor cellular morphological changes were observed (Fig. 4A). Then we evaluated the effect of neuronal overexpression of Nab2 on the microglial cell migration induced by PrPres (Fig. 4B). Two days post-infection with adenoviruses expressing GFP alone or GFP-Nab2, neurons were challenged with 5 μl of hgtsc- or hgtsc+ for 24 h before being assayed the in vitro cell migration assay. Infection with adGFP-Nab2 resulted in a decrease in the rate of N11 microglia migration in an adenovirus concentration-dependent manner. A low but significant decrease in the rate of microglial cell migration was measured in adGFP-infected neurons, likely because of the GFP overexpression. The basal cell migration rate determined by incubating neurons with hgtsc- remained unchanged with all constructs used for infection. To confirm the involvement of Egr-1 in the regulation of RANTES mRNA, real time PCR experiments were performed on cDNA prepared from hgtsc+-stimulated neurons infected with adGFP alone or adGFP Nab-2. RANTES mRNA expression level was down-regulated by 2-fold in hgtsc+-stimulated neurons overexpressing GFP-Nab2 as compared with neurons overexpressing GFP alone. Thus, neuronal overexpression of Nab-2, a corepressor of Egr-1, leads to a decrease of RANTES mRNA level that is concomitant with impaired microglial migration. No significant difference was observed in hgtsc--stimulated neurons in both types of adenovirus infections. In summary, RANTES mRNA production might be under the control of the transient expression of transcription factor Egr-1 induced in PrPres-stimulated neurons in a MAP kinase activation-dependent way. Although there is compelling evidence that inflammatory processes play a significant role in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and TSEs (35McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. Brain Res Brain Res Rev. 1995; 21: 195-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, 36Rezaie P. Lantos P.L. Brain Res Brain Res Rev. 2001; 35: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), little is known concerning the nature of molecular signals responsible for microglia recruitment in the vicinity of amyloid deposits. Recently, we have shown in vitro and in vivo that neurons respond to PrPres exposure by up-regulating the expression of chemokines mainly RANTES. Chemokines released by neurons provoke a rapid recruitment of microglial cells in the vicinity of PrPres aggregates. In contact with PrPres, reactive microglia synthesize diffusible neurotoxic factors that could participate in neuronal cell death. In our attempt to characterize molecular events leading to the increase of chemokine expression, we showed that PrPres activation of MAP kinase/Erk1/2 pathways mediates RANTES expression and microglia recruitment by inducing Elk-1 phosphorylation and Egr-1 expression. Although, in vitro specific binding has been demonstrated between PrPres aggregates and PrPc, the PrPres-induced microglia migration was independent of the presence of PrPc at the neuronal cell surface. As well, the laminin receptor has been shown to bind and internalize PrPc (30Rieger R. Edenhofer F. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and is thought to be also involved in PrPres binding. Specific antibodies developed against the laminin receptor inhibit the accumulation of the pathological isoform, PrPres in N2a neuroblastoma cells (37Leucht C. Simoneau S. Rey C. Vana K. Rieger R. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In our model, neither PrPc nor the laminin receptor are involved in the neuronal cell response induced by PrPres. Further investigations will be required to define the exact nature of neuronal receptors implicated in the PrPres-mediated response. However, direct insertion of PrPres into the cell membranes, particularly in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, might result in disturbances, and subsequent specific cell response cannot be totally ruled out. The importance of intact organization in these microdomains is well illustrated by the elevated Erk1/2 activity following cholesterol depletion in lipid rafts (38Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The observation that PrPres induces phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in primary cultures of neurons supports a potential physiopathological role of the interaction PrPres/putative receptor in modulating neuronal functions. Erk1/2 activation has been associated with a variety of physiological functions like neuronal growth, differentiation, survival, and long term memory (39Kornhauser J.M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1997; 18: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 40Bailey C.H. Kaang B.K. Chen M. Martin K.C. Lim C.S. Casadio A. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 913-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, in a cell culture model of a seizure, the inhibition of Erk1/2 activation could protect hippocampal neurons against the damage resulting from focal cerebral ischemia (41Murray B. Alessandrini A. Cole A.J. Yee A.G. Furshpan E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11975-11980Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 42Alessandrini A. Namura S. Moskowitz M.A. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12866-12869Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Abnormal sustained activation of Erk has been reported in neurons from Alzheimer's disease-affected brains (43Perry G. Roder H. Nunomura A. Takeda A. Friedlich A.L. Zhu X. Raina A.K. Holbrook N. Siedlak S.L. Harris P.L. Smith M.A. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2411-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Basal Erk1/2 phosphorylation was significantly increased in neuroblastoma cells chronically infected with scrapie (44Ostlund P. Lindegren H. Pettersson C. Bedecs K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 97: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our study is the first demonstration of MAP kinase cascade activation induced by PrPres exposure on neurons, suggesting that a perturbation in the balance of intracellular signaling might be responsible for the set up of TSE pathogenesis. Activation of the MAP/Erk1/2 signaling cascade results in a rapid up-regulation of the transcription factor Egr-1 (32Cohen D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11242-11247Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Egr-1 belongs to a wide family of early genes rapidly induced in response to various cell stimuli. The Egr family plays a key role in coordinating subsequent waves of gene expression that underlie long term changes in several cell biological processes like proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, a number of data support a major role of Egr-1 in the acute response to various kinds of stress such as ischemic injury (45Yan S.F. Fujita T. Lu J. Okada K. Shan Zou Y. Mackman N. Pinsky D.J. Stern D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Nuclear corepressor Nab2 selectively inhibits the activity of Egr-1 by binding on a regulatory domain. Nab2 is mostly expressed in the brain and induced by the same stimuli that up-regulate Egr-1 (34Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In N2a neuroblastoma cells, Nab2 expression lags behind that of Egr-1, raising the possibility that Nab2 may act as a negative feedback signal on Egr-1 activity (24Ehrengruber M.U. Muhlebach S.G. Sohrman S. Leutenegger C.M. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 258: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using a recombinant adenovirus to overexpress Nab2, and therefore inhibit endogenous Egr-1 activity of neurons, we showed that Egr-1 is required in the cascade of events leading to the PrPres-induced microglia recruitment. It appears at least in neuronal cell cultures that mainly Egr-1 can be considered a mediator of PrPres-induced gene transcription; nevertheless, the participation of other transcription factors non-regulated by Nab2 is possible. Based on the presence of the Egr-1 binding site on the RANTES gene sequence, it is likely that Egr-1 controls RAN-TES expression by direct interaction on regulatory sequence gene. However, indirect mechanisms of regulation cannot be totally ruled out. Currently, this point is the subject of a thorough investigation in the laboratory. Based on our findings, we propose a pathway for PrPres-induced chemotactism (Fig. 5). The first step would be the interaction of PrPres with a yet unidentified neuronal cell surface receptor. This interaction would trigger a MAP kinase activation pathway leading to the phosphorylation (i.e. activation) of the transcription factor Elk, the main target of p-Erk. Phospho-Elk up-regulates the expression of other transcription factors, among them Egr-1, inducing a subsequent elevation of chemokine expression. It is noteworthy that recombinant PrPc was unable to stimulate the MAP kinases pathway as well as the directional microglia migration (data not shown (20Marella M. Chabry J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 34: 620-627Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar)). This observation suggests that the conformational changes occurring during the conversion PrPc-PrPres could lead to a gain of function. Additionally, PrPres but not PrPc, induces an increase of the intracellular calcium concentration and the subsequent caspase-12 activation in N2a neuroblastoma cells (46Hetz C. Russelakis-Carneiro M. Maundrell K. Castilla J. Soto C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5435-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In summary, the frequent association of reactive microglial cells with PrPres aggregates suggests that active chronic inflammatory response related to amyloid deposits occurs in TSE-affected brains. We hypothesize that abnormal up-regulation of MAP kinases signaling pathway upon PrPres stimulation could be an intraneuronal mechanism disturbing the Erk1/2 balance and could play a significant role to microglia recruitment and neuronal injury. Understanding the PrPres-induced intracellular signaling would provide important mechanistic insights into the earliest molecular events of prion infection.

Stefan Weiss and Sylvain Lehmann for supplying antibodies directed against laminin receptor and scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2063451276,"Dbs is a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor that was identified in a screen for proteins whose overexpression cause deregulated growth in murine fibroblasts. Dbs contains multiple recognizable motifs including a centrally located Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, a COOH-terminal Src homology 3 domain, two spectrin-like repeats, and a recently identified NH2-terminal Sec14 homology domain. The transforming potential of Dbs is substantially activated by the removal of inhibitory sequences that lie outside of the core catalytic sequences, and in this current study we mapped this inhibition to the Sec14 domain. Surprisingly removal of the NH2 terminus did not alter the catalytic activity of Dbs in vivo but rather altered its subcellular distribution. Whereas full-length Dbs was distributed primarily in a perinuclear structure that coincides with a marker for the Golgi apparatus, removal of the Sec14 domain was associated with translocation of Dbs to the cell periphery where it accumulated within membrane ruffles and lamellipodia. However, translocation of Dbs and the concomitant changes in the actin cytoskeleton were not sufficient to fully activate Dbs transformation. The Sec14 domain also forms intramolecular contacts with the pleckstrin homology domain, and these contacts must also be relieved to achieve full transforming activity. Collectively these observations suggest that the Sec14 domain regulates Dbs transformation through at least two distinct mechanisms, neither of which appears to directly influence the in vivo exchange activity of the protein.

The Rho family of small GTPases regulates multiple cellular processes including the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, stimulation of transcriptional activity, and progression through the cell cycle (1Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). Rho proteins function as binary switches cycling between a biologically active GTP-bound conformation (GTP·Rho) and an inactive GDP-bound (GDP·Rho) conformation. When in the active state, Rho proteins are able to propagate cellular signals by forming productive interactions with a wide array of effector molecules (3Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Three families of proteins have been identified that regulate the steady state levels of GTP·Rho in cells: the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: RhoGEF, Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; BFA, brefeldin A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase.1The abbreviations used are: RhoGEF, Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; BFA, brefeldin A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase. activate GTPases by stimulating the GTP-GDP exchange rate, the Rho-specific GTPase-activating proteins (RhoGAPs) down-regulate Rho by stimulating the intrinsic rate of hydrolysis, and the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs) sequester Rho in inactive complexes. The RhoGEFs are a large family of proteins that share a common 300-amino acid structural motif comprised of a Dbl homology (DH) domain arranged in tandem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (4Whitehead I.P.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The DH domain is unique to the RhoGEF family and generally contains all of the residues required for substrate recognition, binding, and exchange (4Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J.

DH domains interact directly with GTPases to catalyze exchange and, like other exchange factor domains, preferentially bind substrates that are depleted of nucleotide and Mg2+ (7Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). The role of the non-catalytic PH domain in the context of RhoGEF family members is more uncertain. Several studies have suggested that the PH domains of RhoGEFs can mediate membrane association, although it is unclear whether this is mediated by direct associations with phospholipids or with membrane-bound proteins (8Fuentes E.J.

Numerous studies have now shown that the transforming activity of the RhoGEFs is intimately connected with their ability to activate Rho family GTPases, and that an intact DH/PH domain module is both necessary and sufficient for this activity (4Whitehead I.P.

Although the oncogenic activation of many RhoGEFs occurs as a consequence of the truncation of regulatory motifs that lie outside the DH/PH domain (16Abe K. Whitehead I.P. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4742-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) there are only a few instances in which the molecular basis for this activation has been identified. For example, both Dbl and Vav1 contain NH2-terminal regulatory domains that inhibit catalytic activity by forming intramolecular contacts with the DH/PH domain module (17Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 18Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Removal of these domains is required for catalytic activation and oncogenic transformation in vivo. Domains that mediate changes in subcellular distribution have also been implicated in RhoGEF activation. For example, oncogenic activation of the Lbc protein requires truncation of its COOH terminus, which is associated with translocation of the protein from the insoluble to the soluble fraction (19Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B. Cheng S.D. Knoll J.H. Urano T. Feig L.A. Toksoz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1334-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the relevant regulatory sequences and the mechanism through which they mediate cellular distribution have not yet been determined. Dbs, and its rat ortholog Ost, are RhoGEF family members that were independently identified in screens for cDNAs whose expression cause deregulated growth in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (20Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 22Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 713-721PubMed Google Scholar). Like many members of the RhoGEF family, Dbs/Ost has potent transforming activity as measured by loss of contact inhibition, growth in low serum, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity in nude mice (20Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 22Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the canonical DH/PH domain, Dbs encodes a COOH-terminal Src homology 3 domain, two spectrin-like repeats, and a recently identified NH2-terminal Sec14 domain (22Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 713-721PubMed Google Scholar, 24Aravind L. Neuwald A.F. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R195-R197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Sec14 protein was first identified and characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein that was required for transport of secretory proteins from the Golgi complex (25Li X. Xie Z. Bankaitis V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Bankaitis V.A. Aitken J.R. Cleves A.E. Dowhan W. Nature. 1990; 347: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The Sec14 structure consists of two domains: an NH2-terminal α-helical domain that is required for lipid transfer and a COOH-terminal lipid-interacting domain (27Sha B. Phillips S.E. Bankaitis V.A. Luo M. Nature. 1998; 391: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although there are no true structural homologs of Sec14 in mammalian cells, regions corresponding to the COOH terminus of Sec14 have been described in the context of a number of mammalian proteins, including RhoGEFs such as Dbs/Ost, Dbl, Trio, Kalirin, and UNC-73 (24Aravind L. Neuwald A.F. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R195-R197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their function in the context of this subfamily of the RhoGEFs is unclear. As with other RhoGEF family members, the transforming versions of Dbs and Ost contain truncations that are responsible for oncogenic activation (20Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Lorenzi M.V. Castagnino P. Chen Q. Hori Y. Miki T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4742-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the current study we determined that the transforming activity of the proto-Dbs protein is negatively regulated by the NH2-terminal Sec14 homology domain. This domain was found to be responsible for phosphoinositide-dependent sequestration of proto-Dbs to a perinuclear region of the cell that corresponds with a marker for the Golgi apparatus. Although a lipid binding mutation in the Sec14 domain caused translocation of proto-Dbs to the cell periphery where it can induce changes in the actin cytoskeleton, this was not sufficient to activate transformation. The Sec14 domain also forms intramolecular contacts with the PH domain that must also be relieved for full transformation to occur. This constitutes a novel mechanism of RhoGEF oncogenic activation that may be relevant to other related members of the RhoGEF family. Molecular Constructs—The mammalian expression vectors pAX142 and pCTV3H have been described previously (28Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 704-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pAX142-dbs-HA6 and pCTV3H-dbs-HA6 contain cDNAs encoding a fragment of murine Dbs (residues 525–1097) fused to a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (29Westwick J.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16739-16747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). pAX142-dbs-HA encodes the full-length Dbs protein (residues 1–1149) fused to a COOH-terminal HA epitope tag (30Cheng L. Mahon G.M. Kostenko E.V. Whitehead I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12786-12793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Dbs deletion mutant constructs pAX142-dbs-Δ75-HA, pAX142-dbs-Δ235-HA, pAX-142-dbs-Δ348-HA, and pAX142-dbs-Δ525-HA were generated based on the pAX142-dbs-HA plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) when possible or PCR-based cloning. To create pCTV3H-based versions of Dbs proteins, the corresponding cDNAs were subcloned from the pAX142 vector into the pCTV3H vector using an MluI/BsiWI digest. The pAX142-dbs-HA8 construct encodes the isolated DH domain of Dbs (residues 523–813), while pAX142-dbs-HA9 encodes the isolated PH domain (residues 791–967) (30Cheng L. Mahon G.M. Kostenko E.V. Whitehead I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12786-12793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). pAX142-dbs-N1-FLAG and pAX142-dbs-Sec14-FLAG contain cDNAs encoding residues 1–525 and 1–235 of Dbs, respectively, fused to the NH2-terminal FLAG tag. A bacterial expression vector encoding the Sec14 homology domain of Dbs (pTrcHisC-dbs-Sec14) was generated by PCR-based cloning of the Dbs cDNA encoding residues 1–235 into the BamHI site of pTrcHisC vector (Invitrogen). The expressed protein contains a His6 tag at the NH2 terminus. When necessary, point mutations were introduced into corresponding plasmids using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA sequences of all constructs were verified by automated sequencing. pCTV3H-Lsc-D7HA encoding residues 1–778 of the Lsc oncoprotein was described previously (29Westwick J.K.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Transformation Assays—NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (JRH Biosciences) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Primary focus formation assays were performed in NIH 3T3 cells as described previously (31Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly NIH 3T3 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Focus formation was scored at 14 days by staining with 0.5% crystal violet. NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with pCTV3H, pCTV3H-dbs-HA6, pCTV3H-dbs-HA, pCTV3H-dbs-Δ75-HA, pCTV3H-dbs-Δ235-HA, pCTV3H-dbs-Δ348-HA, and pCTV3H-dbs-Δ525-HA were generated by calcium phosphate co-precipitation followed by selection for 10 days in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% bovine calf serum) supplemented with hygromycin B (200 μg/ml). Multiple drug-resistant colonies were pooled to establish multiclonal cell lines. Expression and Purification of the Dbs Sec14 Domain—The pTrcHisC-dbs-Sec14 construct was used to express the Sec14 homology domain of Dbs (residues 1–235) in the Escherichia coli strain DH5α. Cultures were grown at 37 °C until A600 = 0.8 and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C for about 14 h. The Dbs protein was about 50% soluble under these conditions and was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using TALON resin (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions to an estimated purity of over 90% as revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. Western blot analysis with a mouse monoclonal anti-His antibody (H-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) showed a single protein band of the expected size. Lipid Binding Assays—Lipid dot-blot strips (PIP Strips) were purchased from Echelon Biosciences Inc., and the recommended protocols were followed. Briefly lipid dot-blots were blocked with 0.1% ovalbumin in TBST (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 at pH 8) for about 1 h and then incubated in TBST containing 0.1% ovalbumin with the protein of interest at 0.5 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. The lipid strips were then washed three times for 10 min each with TBST. To detect lipid protein interactions, strips were then incubated with an anti-His antibody (H-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in TBST containing 0.1% ovalbumin for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed three times for 10 min each with TBST containing 0.1% ovalbumin and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG (Calbiochem) for 30 min at room temperature in the same buffer. The bound protein was visualized using Luminol enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To ensure lipid binding specificity, several different concentrations of a protein were tested. The lowest concentration giving specific binding and a detectable signal on a Western blot was chosen for the lipid dot-blot experiments. Control experiments were performed in parallel using no protein or eluants derived from cells that expressed the cognate vector. Immunostaining—Immunostaining of transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells was performed as described previously (9Rossman K.L. Cheng L. Mahon G.M. Rojas R.J. Snyder J.T. Whitehead I.P. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18393-18400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of plasmid using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). At 24 h post-transfection cells were trypsinized and plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. At 48 h post-transfection cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and then permeabilized and blocked for 1 h in 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Coverslips were then incubated in a humidity chamber with anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (BabCo) for 1 h in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, washed in PBS, and then incubated with red fluorescent Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) in the same buffer for 30 min in the dark. To visualize the actin cytoskeleton, coverslips were incubated for 20 min with 10 μg/ml green fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin conjugate (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with blue fluorescent 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Where indicated the Golgi complex was visualized by counterstaining with a green fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, Molecular Probes) at 10 μg/ml concentration for 30 min in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Where indicated, brefeldin A (BFA, Molecular Probes) treatment of cells was performed for 30 min at 37 °C at a concentration of 10 μg/ml prior to fixing. After incubation, coverslips were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed (see above), and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate of WGA as described above. Cells were viewed with an Olympus IX50 inverted microscope, and images were captured using an Optronics digital CCD camera system. Co-immunoprecipitations—Co-immunoprecipitations in 293T cells were performed as described previously (32Mahon G.M. Wang Y. Korus M. Kostenko E. Cheng L. Sun T. Arlinghaus R.B. Whitehead I.P. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 437-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Lysates were precleared with 0.25 μg of agarose-conjugated normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by rotation for 30 min at 4 °C and precipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) by rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cold lysis buffer and then resuspended in loading dye. Protein Expression—Protein expression in transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells and stable cell lines was determined by standard Western blot analysis (as described previously (33Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)) using a rabbit anti-HA antibody (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (BabCo), respectively. Tubulin expression was detected with an anti-α-tubulin monoclonal mouse antibody (clone DM1A, Sigma). RhoA Activation Assay—Affinity purification assays to measure the levels of GTP-bound RhoA were performed using the Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin (GST-C21) for RhoA as described previously (34Cheng L. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Worthylake D.K. Korus M. Sondek J. Whitehead I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6895-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Total and GTP-bound RhoA was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody (26C4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Activation of endogenously expressed RhoA by Dbs proteins was tested in lysates of NIH 3T3 cell lines stably transfected with pCTV3H-based constructs encoding Dbs proteins or pCTV3H vector. Stable cell lines were maintained in subconfluent conditions and passaged not more than three times. Cells were serum-starved for 16 h prior to harvesting the lysates. Full-length Dbs Has Reduced Transforming Activity Relative to Oncogenic Dbs—The oncogenic Dbs cDNA encodes a truncated version of the full-length protein (onco-Dbs) that contains tandem DH and PH domains along with short flanking sequences (residues 525–1097) (Fig. 1A). Full-length Dbs (Fig. 1A, proto-Dbs) is an 1149-amino acid-long protein that includes a recently identified NH2-terminal Sec14 homology domain (residues 75–221), two spectrin-like repeats (residues 235–348 and 354–445), a DH/PH domain module (residues 623–967), and a COOH-terminal Src homology 3 domain (residues 1058–1115). Since many members of the RhoGEF family appear to exist in an inactive, basal state prior to activation (16Abe K. Whitehead I.P. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30410-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1334-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we compared the transforming activities of proto-Dbs and onco-Dbs to determine whether the missing NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences can confer inhibitory constraints on the transforming activity of the full-length protein. The transforming activities of proto-Dbs and onco-Dbs were compared in a primary focus formation assay by transfection of a pAX142-dbs-HA6 construct encoding HA-tagged onco-Dbs and a pAX142-dbs-HA construct encoding HA-tagged proto-Dbs into NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Despite being expressed at equivalent levels (Fig. 1B), proto-Dbs had much weaker transforming activity compared with the Dbs oncogene (Fig. 1, C and D; ≤3% of transforming activity of onco-Dbs). Although much reduced in number, proto-Dbs foci exhibited characteristic onco-Dbs morphology (not shown). These results are consistent with the previous observation that the rat ortholog of Dbs, Ost, also contains inhibitory sequences within its NH2 terminus (20Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Lorenzi M.V. Castagnino P. Chen Q. Hori Y. Miki T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4742-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Sec14 Homology Domain Causes Activation of proto-Dbs Transforming Activity—To identify the structural domains that inhibit proto-Dbs transforming activity, we generated a series of proto-Dbs deletion mutants representing successive truncations of NH2-terminal domains (Fig. 1A). Breakpoints for the mutants were chosen with consideration of the protein domain structure to allow correct folding of the truncated protein. For maximum expression efficiency we introduced a Kozak consensus sequence at the NH2 terminus of each mutant. Each cDNA was cloned into the pAX142 vector and then assessed for expression levels in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1B). All truncation mutants showed comparable levels of expression. The transforming potential of the proto-Dbs deletion mutants were then compared in an NIH 3T3 cell primary focus formation assay (Fig. 1, C and D). To ensure that primary focus formation assays were not performed under saturated conditions, the transforming activities of the Dbs deletion mutant proteins were determined at several DNA concentrations. NIH 3T3 cells that were transfected with 0.1, 0.5, or 1 μg of DNA demonstrated a clear dose-dependent response in the number of foci generated (not shown). These data were then used to determine the relative transforming activity of the Dbs deletion mutant proteins (Fig. 1D). Completion of the COOH-terminal Src homology 3 domain of onco-Dbs (deletion mutant DbsΔ525) did not result in significant abrogation of the onco-Dbs transforming activity. This suggests that the Src homology 3 domain is not involved in the inhibition of transforming activity in the context of the full-length protein and that the negative regulatory signals reside within the NH2 terminus. Indeed sequential deletion of the NH2-terminal domains resulted in activation of proto-Dbs transforming activity. Removal of the Sec14 homology domain (deletion mutant DbsΔ235) resulted in significant activation of proto-Dbs transforming activity (up to 80% of onco-Dbs), while the full activation of proto-Dbs transforming potential was achieved by deletion of the adjacent spectrin repeat (deletion mutant DbsΔ348). Deletion of the sequences between the NH2 terminus and the Sec14 domain (DbsΔ75) had no effect on transforming activity. Collectively these results suggest that the Sec14 homology domain represents a major regulatory element involved in the negative control of proto-Dbs transforming potential.

https://openalex.org/W2062074492,"l-Mimosine is a naturally occurring plant amino acid and iron chelator that arrests the cell cycle in the late G1 phase, although its mechanism of action is not known. Some studies indicate that mimosine prevents the initiation of DNA replication, whereas other studies indicate that mimosine disrupts elongation of the replication fork by impairing deoxyribonucleotide synthesis by inhibiting the activity of the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and the transcription of the cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene (SHMT1). In this study, the mechanism for mimosine-induced inhibition of SHMT1 transcription was elucidated. A mimosine-responsive transcriptional element was localized within the first 50 base pairs of the human SHMT1 promoter by deletion analyses and gel mobility shift assays. The 50-base-pair sequence contains a consensus zinc-sensing metal regulatory element (MRE) at position -44 to -38, and mutation of the MRE attenuated mimosine-induced transcription repression. Mimosine treatment eliminated MRE- and Sp1-binding activity in nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells but not in nuclear extracts from a mimosine-resistant cell line, MCF-7/2a. MCF-7 cells cultured in zinc-depleted medium for more than 16 days were viable and lacked cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase protein, confirming that mimosine inhibits SHMT1 transcription by chelating zinc. The disruption of DNA-protein interactions by zinc chelation provides a general mechanism for the inhibitory effects of mimosine on nuclear processes, including replication and transcription. Furthermore, this study establishes that SHMT1 is a zinc-inducible gene, which provides the first mechanism for the regulation of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism by zinc. l-Mimosine is a naturally occurring plant amino acid and iron chelator that arrests the cell cycle in the late G1 phase, although its mechanism of action is not known.

Mimosine arrests cell cycle progression in late G1 and although it elicits a plethora of biological effects, its mechanism of action has not been established. Mimosine has been proposed to arrest DNA synthesis at the replication fork by repressing deoxyribonucleotide synthesis (9Gilbert D.M. Neilson A. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Burhans W.C. J. Biol.

Furthermore, mimosine and deferoxamine have been shown to inhibit the transcription of the cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene (SHMT1) 1The abbreviations used are: SHMT1, cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene; MEM, minimal essential medium; MRE, metal response element; NF, nuclear factor. in MCF-7 cells but not in mimosine-resistant SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma (2Oppenheim E.W.

The cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase enzyme (CSHMT) catalyzes the tetrahydrofolate-dependent conversion of serine to glycine, a reaction that generates folate-activated one-carbon units that are required for purine, thymidine, and methionine biosynthesis (13Herbig K.

Therefore, it has been proposed that mimosine may impair deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis by inhibiting CSHMT and ribonucleotide reductase (5Alpan R.S. Pardee A.B.

Other studies demonstrate that mimosine disrupts the initiation phase of DNA replication at the origins of replication in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Mimosine is novel in this regard; it prevents formation of replication intermediates (4Mosca P.J. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell.

Mimosine also affects gene expression at the level of transcription and translation. Mimosine increases the expression of p21WAF-1 (5Alpan R.S. Pardee A.B.

Pharmacol. 1996; 139: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mimosine also inhibits the activity of several enzymes in vitro including tyrosinase, dopamine β-hydroxylase, deoxyhypusyl hydroxylase, and H1 kinase (3Reno F. Tontini A. Burattini S. Papa S. Falcieri E. Tarzia G. Apoptosis. 1999; 4: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, none of these effects provide a definitive mechanism for cell cycle arrest, nor do they account for the cell-specific effects that mimosine exerts. In this study, we elucidated the molecular mechanism for mimosine-induced transcriptional repression of the human SHMT1 gene to provide insight into its inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression. Materials—Fetal bovine serum and α-minimal essential medium (αMEM) were obtained from Hyclone Laboratories. Zinc-depleted fetal bovine serum was prepared as described elsewhere (18Ho E. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16770-16775Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Mammary adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells and the mimosine-resistant cell line MCF-7/2a (2Oppenheim E.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19268-19274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were maintained in αMEM with 11% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Mimosine was purchased from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma Genosys; pfu Taq polymerase and dNTPs were from Stratagene, and [γ-32P]dATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Generation of SHMT1 Promoter Deletion Fragments—The human SHMT1 proximal promoter -409 to -1, and all deletion and mutated fragments thereof were cloned 5′ of the firefly luciferase gene in the basic (promoterless) pGL3 reporter plasmid (Promega). Fragments of the promoter were generated by PCR and sequence verified. The following primer pairs were used to generate promoter fragments: for the -298 to -109 fragment, the forward primer was 5′-ATGCGCTAGCGTAGTACCATGAAC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-ATGCAGATCTGTTTCTCCGGGGCGG-3′; for the -409 to -237 fragment, the forward primer was 5′-ATGCGCTAGCTAATAATAATAAAGTGTCTGC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-ATGCAGATCTCCTTCCTCACTTAAGCCTG-3′; for the -219 to -50 fragment, the forward primer was 5′-ATGCGCTAGCGGAAATCTTGGTCCAC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CATAGATCTGCCGCCACCAAACGCACCAAACGCACC-3′. The following serial promoter deletion fragments were generated using a common reverse primer 5′-ATGCAGATCTTTGGGCTTGGCCCCG-3′. The forward primer for the -219 to -1 fragment was 5′-ATGCGCTAGCGGAAATCTTGGTCCAC-3′; the forward primer for the -100 to -1 fragment was 5′-AGCTGCTAGCGCTTGGCTGC-3′; the forward primer for the -75 to -1 fragment was 5′-AGCTGCTAGCCGGGTGCGTTG-3′; the forward primer for the -50 to -1 fragment was 5′-AGCTGCTAGCCGCCGCTGCGC-3′. The underlined sequences on the forward and reverse primers indicate NheI and BglII restriction endonuclease sequences, respectively, that facilitated the cloning into the pGL3 vector. For all primer sets, the cycling conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 7 min for 30 cycles. The concatenated vector ((-219 to -1)(-50 to -1)) was constructed by cloning a double-stranded oligonucleotide identical to the sequence -50 to -1 at the 3′ end of the -219 to -1 fragment in the basic pGL3 vector. Mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the sequence was verified. To mutate the nuclear factor 1 (NF1) site, the forward oligonucleotide primer was 5′-GGTGGCGGCCCATGCGGTGCTGCGCTCTCTGATTGGGCG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CGCCCAATCAGAGAGCGCAGCACCGCATGGGCCGCCACC-3′. To mutate the metal response element (MRE) site, the forward oligonucleotide primer was 5′-GGTGGCGGCCCATGCTTGGCTATTCTCTCTGATTGGGCG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CGCCCAATCAGAGAGAATAGCCAAGCATGGGCCGCCACC-3′. Bold letters indicate base pair changes in the NF1/MRE element. The cycling conditions were 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. Gene Reporter Assays—MCF-7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and upon attachment were treated with equal volumes of phosphate-buffered saline or mimosine (final concentration of 100 μm) for 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with one of various SHMT1 promoter constructs using FuGENE transfectamine (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol and cultured for an additional 24 h in culture medium that contained (experimental) or lacked (control) 100 μm mimosine. Firefly luciferase activity was measured using Dual Glo luciferase kit (Promega) and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity that was generated from the co-transfected control pRL-cytomegalovirus vector. In all cases, luciferase activity measurements were corrected for background; all luciferase activity values were a minimum of 20-fold greater than background. All luciferase data is presented as a ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity. Nuclear Protein Preparation and Electromobility Shift Assays— MCF-7 cells were grown to 70–80% confluence on 100-mm plates and then cultured in medium with or without 300 μm mimosine for 48 h. Nuclei were isolated from fresh cell pellets as described elsewhere (19Kingston R.E. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2.12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 12.11.11-12.11.16Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the NF1/MRE element present in the SHMT1 promoter (-53 to -31) were 5′-end labeled using T4 polykinase and [γ-32P]dATP. Reaction solutions containing 0.1 ng of labeled probe, 1.2 μg of a poly(dI-dC) oligonucleotide, 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μg of nuclear protein, 20 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, and 100 mm KCl at pH 7.9 were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and immediately loaded into a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant 22 mA for 3h. Gels were dried, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. The sequence of oligonucleotides representing SHMT1 promoter fragments are shown below; bold letters indicate a change in base pairs from the NF1/MRE oligonucleotide: NF1/MRE, 5′-CTAGCCCCATGCTTGGCTGCGCTCTCTGATTA-3′; mutated NF1, 5′-CTAGCCCCATGCGAGACTGCGCTCTCTGATTA-3′; mutated MRE, 5′-CTAGCCCCATGCTTGGCTACAATCTCTGATTA-3′; Sp1, 5′-CTAGCGGTCCCTGCCCAGGTA-3′. Western Analysis—MCF-7 and MCF-7/2a cells were passaged in either αMEM, zinc-deficient αMEM, zinc-deficient αMEM + 4 μm ZnCl, or αMEM + 4 μm ZnCl over a 40-day period. Cells were harvested every four days, and total CSHMT and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein levels were determined by Western blot analyses as described elsewhere (2Oppenheim E.W. Nasrallah I.M. Mastri M.G. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19268-19274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purified sheep anti-human CSHMT antibody (20Oppenheim E.W. Adelman C. Liu X. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19855-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:50,000 dilution; rabbit anti-human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Novus) was used at a 1:100,000 dilution. Identification of Mimosine-responsive Transcriptional Elements—A mimosine-responsive cis element was identified in the SHMT1 5′-promoter by comparing SHMT1 promoter activity in transiently transfected MCF-7 cells that were cultured in the presence and absence of 100 μm mimosine (Fig. 2). Mimosine inhibited the activity of the SV40 promoter by 27%, whereas the activity of the SHMT1 proximal promoter (-409 to -1) was inhibited by 96%. A mimosine-responsive element was localized to the first 50 base pairs of the SHMT1 promoter by serial deletion of the SHMT1 promoter in the 5′ to 3′ direction; a second mimosine-responsive element was indicated in the -219 to -50 promoter fragment. The mimosine-responsive promoter fragment -50 to -1 exhibited only 16% of the promoter activity associated with the -219 to -1 promoter fragment in the absence of mimosine treatment but displayed strong enhancer activity. The -50 to -1 promoter fragment is essential for the strong promoter activity associated with the -219 to -1 fragment as evidenced by the low promoter activity of the -219 to -50 fragment and the nearly 2-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of the -219 to -1 promoter fragment that resulted upon the insertion of a second copy of the -50 to -1 fragment 3′ of the -219 to -1 promoter fragment. All enhancer activity associated with the -50 to -1 promoter fragment was lost upon mimosine exposure (Fig. 2). The mimosine responsive enhancer element -1 to -50 was analyzed for consensus transcriptional cis-acting sequences using the Transcription Element Sequence Survey. An overlapping NF1-(-49 to -44) (21Gronostajski R.M. Gene. 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and MRE-(-44 to -38) (22Giedroc D.P. Chen X. Apuy J.L. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2001; 3: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was identified as a candidate for the mimosine responsive cis-element (Fig. 3). MRE enhancer elements often contain overlapping Sp1 binding sites, which are believed to confer negative regulation to the MRE (22Giedroc D.P. Chen X. Apuy J.L. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2001; 3: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). MRE elements are present in the promoters of zinc-activated genes and are bound by the transcription factor MTF-1, an 80-kDa zinc finger DNA binding protein with transcriptional activation domains (22Giedroc D.P. Chen X. Apuy J.L. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2001; 3: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23Cousins R.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 449-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Zinc is essential for MTF-1 binding to the MRE (23Cousins R.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 449-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mutation of the NF1 consensus sequence in the SHMT1 promoter -219 to -1 partially attenuated mimosine inhibition by ∼20% without influencing SHMT1 promoter activity (Fig. 2). Mutation of the consensus MRE sequence decreased the promoter activity of the -219 to -1 fragment by 60% in the absence of mimosine and attenuated mimosine inhibition by nearly 40%. From these studies, we conclude both that the MRE is a strong enhancer of SHMT1 transcription and that it contributes to the mimosine responsiveness of the SHMT1 gene. Mimosine Inhibits MRE and Sp1 Binding Activity—The effect of mimosine on MRE and Sp1 binding activity was determined in nuclear extracts isolated from MCF-7 cells by gel mobility shift assays. Mimosine exposure did not affect qualitatively the SDS-PAGE profile of MCF-7 nuclear protein (Fig. 4) but did inhibit MRE and Sp1 binding activity. Nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells bound a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe that contains the sequence of the overlapping NF1/MRE element -50 to -31 as is evident from the gel shift (Fig. 5), whereas nuclear extracts from mimosine-treated cells displayed no or very weak binding activity. Mutation of the MRE consensus sequence weakened or eliminated binding activity in MCF-7 cell extracts, whereas MCF-7 nuclear extracts retained the ability to bind the NF1 mutated probe, although the intensity of the band shift was diminished compared with the non-mutated probe. Mimosine exposure eliminated the binding activity of nuclear extracts for all probes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that factors present in MCF-7 nuclear extracts bind to the MRE consensus sequence located within the mimosine-responsive promoter fragment -50 to -1 (Fig. 2), but this activity is lost in MCF-7 cells that were exposed to mimosine.Fig. 5Effect of mimosine on NF1/MRE binding activity in MCF-7 cells. The binding activity of nuclear extracts isolated from MCF-7 cells and mimosine-treated MCF-7 cells was determined using a probe that represents nucleotide sequence -50 to -31 of the SHMT1 promoter, which contains an overlapping NF1/MRE element. The mutated MRE probe contained the nucleotide sequence -50 to -31 of the SHMT1 promoter, except the MRE element was changed from 5′-TGCGCTC-3′ to 5′-TACAATC-3′. The mutated NF1 probe contained the nucleotide sequence -50 to -31 of the SHMT1 promoter, except the NF1 element was changed from 5′-TTGGCT-3′ to 5′-GAGACT-3′. In all cases, the addition of unlabeled probe refers to the nonmutated probe that represents nucleotide sequence -50 to -31 of the SHMT1 promoter. The arrow designates the mimosine sensitive band shift.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously, we described the isolation of the mimosine-resistant MCF-7/2a cell line, which does not exhibit mimosine-induced inhibition of cell cycle or SHMT1 transcription (2Oppenheim E.W. Nasrallah I.M. Mastri M.G. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19268-19274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts isolated from mimosine-treated MCF-7/2a cells retained the ability to bind the probe containing the NF1/MRE consensus sequence (-50 to -31) (Fig. 6). To determine whether the binding activity of another zinc-requiring transcription factor was impaired by mimosine, the effect of mimosine on Sp1 binding activity in nuclear extracts was determined. The SHMT1 promoter contains an Sp1 site -173 to -165, and this sequence was used to generate a probe for gel mobility shift assay analyses (Fig. 6B). Nuclear extracts isolated from MCF-7 cells bound the Sp1 probe, whereas nuclear extracts from mimosine-treated cells did not bind the Sp1 probe. However, mimosine treatment did not impair Sp1 binding activity in nuclear extracts from mimosine-resistant MCF-7/2a cells. These data provide strong evidence that mimosine impairs SHMT1 transcription by chelating zinc and thereby inhibits the activity of zinc-dependent transcription factors. Expression of the SHMT1 Gene Is Zinc-dependent—The effect of zinc availability on CSHMT protein levels was determined in MCF-7 cells by Western blot analyses (Fig. 7). MCF-7 cells passaged in zinc depleted culture medium (18Ho E. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16770-16775Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) displayed a 50% decrease in CSHMT protein levels after 8 days of culture and greater than a 95% decrease from day 16 through day 40. MCF-7 cells passaged in zinc deficient medium that was supplemented with 4 μm zinc exhibited similar CSHMT protein levels as those passaged in αMEM. Similar effects on CSHMT protein levels were observed for the mimosine-resistant MCF-7/2a cell line (Fig. 7). The results of this study establish cis elements that bind zinc finger transcription factors, including MREs and Sp1, as mimosine-responsive transcriptional elements and thereby provide a definitive mechanism for mimosine-induced repression of SHMT1 gene transcription. Iron chelators, including deferiprone and deferoxamine, exhibit appreciable affinity for zinc and can deplete the labile intracellular zinc pool in cultured murine thymocytes (7Maclean K.H. Cleveland J.L. Porter J.B. Blood. 2001; 98: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Hider R.C. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In patients with iron overload, chronic deferiprone treatment is associated with zinc deficiency (7Maclean K.H. Cleveland J.L. Porter J.B. Blood. 2001; 98: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24al-Refaie F.N. Wonke B. Wickens D.G. Aydinok Y. Fielding A. Hoffbrand A.V. J. Clin. Pathol. (Lond.). 1994; 47: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and this effect has been proposed to be responsible for triggering thymocyte apoptosis during therapy (7Maclean K.H. Cleveland J.L. Porter J.B. Blood. 2001; 98: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mimosine impairs the binding activity of the zinc finger proteins MTF-1 and Sp1, an observation that suggests a general mechanism for the effect of mimosine on nuclear processes including replication and transcription. Biological responses elicited by mimosine may result from inhibition of zinc-dependent DNA binding metalloproteins including those involved in DNA replication initiation (25Cook C.R. Kung G. Peterson F.C. Volkman B.F. Lei M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36051-36058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Burke T.W. Cook J.G. Asano M. Nevins J.R. J. Biol.

Virol. 2004; 78: 3851-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Whereas the in vivo zinc chelating activity of mimosine and other iron chelators would be expected to be invariant among cell types, mimosine is a cell-specific inhibitor of both cell cycle and SHMT1 transcription. Previously, we reported the generation of the mimosine-resistant MCF-7/2a cell line, which displayed normal to elevated SHMT1 transcriptional activity in the presence of either mimosine or deferoxamine (2Oppenheim E.W. Nasrallah I.M. Mastri M.G. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19268-19274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating that the inhibitory effect of mimosine on cell cycle progression and SHMT1 transcription results from a common mechanism (2Oppenheim E.W. Nasrallah I.M. Mastri M.G. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19268-19274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In support of this suggestion, both MFT-1 and Sp1 binding activity is unaffected by mimosine in MCF-7/2a cells, indicating that mimosine cannot effectively prevent the incorporation of zinc into zinc finger DNA binding proteins in this resistant cell line, although SHMT1 expression remains sensitive to zinc depletion of the culture medium (Fig. 7). Therefore, cellular mimosine resistance is most likely conferred by limiting the cellular accumulation of metal chelators, either by enhancing their metabolism or efflux or by preventing their import, which thereby prevents the sequestration of intracellular zinc. The regulation of SHMT1 transcription by MTF-1 indicates that zinc status may regulate folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. The CSHMT enzyme plays a key role in the regulation of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism; it serves as a metabolic switch that preferentially directs folate-activated one-carbon units into the thymidylate synthesis pathway and impairs the homocysteine remethylation pathway by sequestering 5-methyltetrahydrofolate rendering it unavailable for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (13Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Zinc status is known to affect folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been established. Zinc deficiency in rats lowers plasma homocysteine concentrations by 65% and reduces hepatic 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations (28Hong K.H. Keen C.L. Mizuno Y. Johnston K.E. Tamura T. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2000; 11: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although the effects of zinc deficiency on lowering plasma homocysteine and hepatic 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations have been attributed to very modest increases in hepatic methionine synthase activity (28Hong K.H. Keen C.L. Mizuno Y. Johnston K.E. Tamura T. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2000; 11: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), they are also consistent with an attenuation of SHMT1 expression and subsequent derepression of the homocysteine remethylation cycle. Because human zinc deficiency is common (29Ames B.N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1019: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and impairments in folate metabolism are strongly associated with human pathologies including cancers, cardiovascular disease, and developmental anomalies, further investigation into the role of zinc in regulating folate metabolism is clearly warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2005214429,"Both the transcription factor c-Jun and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) have been associated with neuronal loss in several death paradigms. JNK are key regulators of c-Jun and a common accepted model has been that JNKs mediate neuronal death through modulation of c-Jun activation. In the present study, we examined whether JNK2 and -3 (JNK members most associated with neuronal loss) deficiency can rescue neuronal loss caused by facial and sciatic nerve axotomy in the neonate in vivo. JNK2, JNK3, and JNK2/3 double-deficient neurons displayed significantly less death in the facial nerves of the CNS when compared with controls. JNK2 and JNK2/3 double-deficient animals also showed reduced c-Jun phosphorylation and induction following axotomy, consistent with the model that JNK acts to regulate death by activating c-Jun. Of significance, however, protection of facial nerves in JNK3-deficient animals was not accompanied by reduction in c-Jun activation. These results suggest that JNKs can mediate death independently of c-Jun. Importantly, the lack of correlation between JNK3 deficiency and c-Jun induction was not universal. In a sciatic axotomy model of neuronal injury in the neonate, death of DRG neurons was also reduced by JNK3 deficiency. However, in this case, c-Jun activation was also eliminated.

JNK2 and JNK2/3 double-deficient animals also showed reduced c-Jun phosphorylation and induction following axotomy, consistent with the model that JNK acts to regulate death by activating c-Jun. Of significance, however, protection of facial nerves in JNK3-deficient animals was not accompanied by reduction in c-Jun activation. These results suggest that JNKs can mediate death independently of c-Jun. Importantly, the lack of correlation between JNK3 deficiency and c-Jun induction was not universal. In a sciatic axotomy model of neuronal injury in the neonate, death of DRG neurons was also reduced by JNK3 deficiency. However, in this case, c-Jun activation was also eliminated. Neuronal apoptosis is regulated by a complex series of molecular events, which in many cases culminate in activation of the conserved mitochondrial pathway of death characterized by the activation of the apoptosome. Numerous signals, which activate this conserved death pathway have been identified (for example, Ref. 1Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5017-5026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that one such regulatory signal may involve activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; NGF, nerve growth factor.

JNKs, also known as stress-activated kinases (SAPK), are a family of three (JNK1, -2, -3) kinases, which are activated by numerous stimuli including cytokines, osmotic stress, and death inducing stimuli such as growth factor deprivation, DNA damage, dopaminergic toxins, axotomy, and ischemic insult (3Park D.S.

JNK-mediated phosphorylation on Ser63 and Ser73 leads to transcriptional activation of c-Jun and the AP-1 complex (12Karin M. J. Biol.

The JNKs themselves are activated by upstream kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family including MKK4 and 7, which are in turn activated by a larger group of upstream kinases including MEKKs, MLKs, and ASK1 (5Minden A.

Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The biological role of the JNK/c-Jun pathway is varied and likely depends upon the biological context. c-Jun activation has a clear role in proliferation (17Johnson R.S. van Lingen B. Papaioannou V.E. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and differentiation (18Hilberg F. Aguzzi A. Howells N. Wagner E.F. Nature. 1993; 365: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). For example, c-Jun deficiency leads to cell cycle defects in fibroblasts and impaired hepatogenesis (17Johnson R.S. van Lingen B. Papaioannou V.E. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 18Hilberg F. Aguzzi A. Howells N. Wagner E.F. Nature. 1993; 365: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Also, JNK1/2 double-deficient mice display neuronal tube developmental defects (19Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The role of the JNK/c-Jun pathway in cell death however, is controversial. A number of studies have attributed both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic functions for the JNKs (see Refs. 20Lin A. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar and 21Herdegen T. Skene P. Bahr M. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar for review). In neuronal systems, a large and growing body of evidence suggests that the JNK/c-Jun pathway can function in a proapoptotic manner. JNK3 is predominately expressed in the brain and is most consistently associated with neuronal death. For example, JNK3 is critical for c-Jun phosphorylation and death induced by focal ischemia in vivo, while JNK1 and 2 deficiency do not appear to play a role (9Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Yang D.D. Liao G. Schloemer A.J. Dong C. Bao J. Banasiak K.J. Haddad G.G. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15184-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). JNK3 is also critical for c-Jun phosphorylation and dopaminergic loss in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine model of Parkinson's disease (11Hunot S. Vila M. Teismann P. Davis R.J. Hirsch E.C. Przedborski S. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 665-670Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, in this case, JNK2 also appears to mediate neuronal loss (11Hunot S. Vila M. Teismann P. Davis R.J. Hirsch E.C. Przedborski S. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 665-670Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The crucial role for c-Jun as a downstream target of JNK-mediated neuronal death is supported by the observations that in cases where JNK deficiency inhibits death, c-Jun phosphorylation is also reduced. In these paradigms, c-Jun has been shown to be a required factor in death signaling. Examples of such linkages have been observed in neuronal death paradigms in vitro, e.g. NGF deprivation (10Putcha G.V. Le S. Frank S. Besirli C.G. Clark K. Chu B. Alix S. Youle R.J. LaMarche A.

Whereas the canonical JNK-c-Jun pathway appears crucial in many instances of neuronal death, JNKs are also known to directly regulate other transcription factors and death regulators. These include the tumor suppressor p53 (25Buschmann T. Potapova O. Bar-Shira A. Ivanov V.N. Fuchs S.Y. Henderson S. Fried V.A. Minamoto T. Alarcon-Vargas D. Pincus M.R. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J.

A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). For example, in non-neuronal systems, p53 can be phosphorylated and stabilized by JNK phosphorylation (25Buschmann T. Potapova O. Bar-Shira A. Ivanov V.N. Fuchs S.Y. Henderson S. Fried V.A. Minamoto T. Alarcon-Vargas D. Pincus M.R. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Shiloh Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell.

JNKs have also been shown to regulate BIM through direct phosphorylation as well as through induction of the AP-1 response (10Putcha G.V. Le S. Frank S. Besirli C.G. Clark K. Chu B. Alix S.

A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unclear whether JNK-mediated neuronal death necessarily occurs through c-Jun or whether other death signals may also be of central importance. The significance of this question is also supported by observations that c-Jun activation can occur without concomitant neuronal death. This is most clear in cases of neuronal axotomy where prolonged c-Jun activation has been observed (30Herdegen T. Claret F.X. Kallunki T. Martin-Villalba A. Winter C. Hunter T. Karin M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5124-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and it has been suggested that c-Jun may in fact participate in regenerative processes (31Herdegen T. Waetzig V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2424-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Raivich G. Bohatschek M. Da Costa C. Iwata O. Galiano M. Hristova M. Nateri A.S. Makwana M. Riera-Sans L. Wolfer D.P. Lipp H.P. Aguzzi A. Wagner E.F. Behrens A. Neuron. 2004; 43: 57-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the importance of the JNK/c-Jun pathway in the context of two neonatal models (sciatic and facial) of axotomy. Here we demonstrate that c-Jun activation is not necessarily the main component of JNK-mediated death. We show that while JNK3 deficiency inhibits c-Jun activation and protects peripheral sensory neurons from death, the protection afforded by JNK3 deficiency in facial motor neurons is not accompanied by reduced c-Jun phosphorylation. Accordingly, we suggest that, at least in certain neuronal contexts, JNK-mediated death signals act through other c-Jun-independent signals. Facial Nerve Axotomy—Axotomy of the right facial nerve was performed on postnatal day 1 mouse pups. Briefly, pups (C57/Bl background) were anesthetized with a gas mixture of 2–5% isofluorane and O2 at a flow rate of 1 liter/min, a 1-cm incision (medial to lateral) was made caudal to the right ear. The musculature was separated to expose the facial nerve. The branches of the right facial nerve were transected as they exited the stylomastoid foramen. The musculature was closed and the skin was sutured together with Prolene 6–0 suture (Johnson & Johnson). Mice were sacrificed 24 h or 4 days following axotomy. For quantitation of survival, every fifth section through the facial nucleus was evaluated by cresyl violet staining and the total number of live motor neurons was evaluated both ispialteral and contralateral to the axotomy as previously described (33Vanderluit J.L. McPhail L.T. Fernandes K.J. McBride C.B. Huguenot C. Roy S. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Tetzlaff W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3469-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Sciatic Nerve Axotomy—Neonatal pups from mice (JNK knockout and littermate controls; C57/Bl background see below) were utilized for these studies. Sciatic nerve axotomy was performed on postnatal day 1 pups as previously described (34Sun W. Oppenheim R.W. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the animals were anesthetized by a gas mixture of 2–5% isofluorane and O2 at a flow rate of 1 liter/min, an incision was made in the right leg parallel to the femur. The nerve was transected at mid-thigh level. The pups were returned to their mothers after suturing. At the indicated times, the animals were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion as described above. Right and left L4-L6 dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) with attached vertebra were dissected and fixed by immersion in Bouins fixative (34Sun W. Oppenheim R.W. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Tissue was then embedded in paraffin and 5-μm serial sections were cut using a rotary microtome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin as previously described (35Wang F. Corbett D. Osuga H. Osuga S. Ikeda J.E. Slack R.S. Hogan M.J. Hakim A.M. Park D.S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To obtain neuronal counts, neurons showing a nucleolus were counted in every fifth section of the L5 ganglion both ipsilateral and contralateral to the axotomy. Alternatively, spinal cord containing L4-L6 DRGs were removed after perfusion and postfixed in 4% PFA in 0.1 m phosphate buffer overnight at 4 °C as previously described (36Crocker S.J. Smith P.D. Jackson-Lewis V. Lamba W.R. Hayley S.P. Grimm E. Callaghan S.M. Slack R.S. Melloni E. Przedborski S. Robertson G.S. Anisman H. Merali Z. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4081-4091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue was cryoprotected in 10% sucrose solution in 0.1 m phosphate buffer as previously described (36Crocker S.J. Smith P.D. Jackson-Lewis V. Lamba W.R. Hayley S.P. Grimm E. Callaghan S.M. Slack R.S. Melloni E. Przedborski S. Robertson G.S. Anisman H. Merali Z. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4081-4091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 14-μm cryostat sections were obtained for immunofluorescent analyses (see below). Knockout Mice—For knockout studies, JNK3 and JNK2 knockouts were obtained by heterozygous or heterozygous/homozygous knockout pairings. Newborn pups were axotomized as described above. Immediately prior to perfusion and fixation, tail clips were obtained for genotyping. JNK3 knockout embryos were genotyped using CCTGCTTCTCAGAAACACCCTTC (MJ3B3), CGTAATCTTGTCCACAGAAATCCCATAC (MJ3F3) and CTCCAGACTGCCTTGGGAAAA (PGKP1) primers in one PCR reaction under following PCR conditions: 95 °C, 5 min (1 cycle); 95 °C, 1 min; 58 °C, 1 min (–1.0 °C/cycle); 72 °C, 1 min (10 cycle); 95 °C, 1 min; 48 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min (20 cycle); 72 °C, 5min. JNK2 were genotyped under identical conditions. However GTTAGACAATCCCAGAGGTTGTGTG (MJ2F5), CCAGCTCATTCCTCCACTCATG (PGKT1), and GGAGCCCGATAGTATCGAGTTACC (MJ2B3) primers were utilized. Immunofluorescence—Fixed sections containing L5 DRGs or the facial motor nucleus were incubated with Ser63 c-Jun, Ser73 c-Jun, c-Jun, p53, phospho-Ser15 p53, Elk-1, phospho-Ser383 Elk-1, ATF2, phospho-Thr69/71 ATF-2 (1:200; Cell Signaling), phospho-Ser65 BIM (1:200; Upstate) antibodies overnight at 4 °C in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 containing 0.3% Triton X-100. After 3 washes with phosphate-buffered saline, sections were then incubated with CY3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson 1:200) for 3 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with Hoechst 33258 to visualize nuclei as previously described (37Keramaris E. Stefanis L. Maclaurin J. Harada N. Takaku K. Ishikawa T. Taketo M.M. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Slack R.S. Park D.S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Quantitation of phosphorylated c-Jun or c-Jun positive neurons was assessed by counting the number of CY3-positive neurons in at least two separate midsections of each nuclei. To evaluate the intensity of staining, a random field for each nucleus was chosen. Densitometry was performed by subtracting background signal from each positive staining neuron in that field using a computer-based image analysis system (Northern Eclipse, Empix Imaging). For each nucleus, the densitometry values were averaged. This was performed for nuclei both ipsilateral and contralateral to the axotomy. Each data point is the representation of at least three different animals and is presented as mean ± S.E. JNK3 Modulates Death of Facial Motor Neurons—Axotomy of the facial nerve in neonates results in death of neurons of the facial motor nuclei. Previous work has shown that this results in apoptotic death, which is associated with caspase induction (33Vanderluit J.L. McPhail L.T. Fernandes K.J. McBride C.B. Huguenot C. Roy S. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Tetzlaff W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3469-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Rossiter J.P. Riopelle R.J. Bisby M.A. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 138: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Utilizing this model, we first asked whether JNKs might be required for death. Because, JNK2 and -3 are most associated with death of neurons, we focused on these two JNK family members. Axotomy was performed on JNK3 knockout mice or littermate controls and the number of surviving neurons in the facial motor nucleus was examined 4 days following axotomy. As shown in Fig. 1B, axotomy resulted in survival of ∼13% of facial motor neurons in littermate control mice 4 days following axotomy. In contrast, there was almost 3-fold the number of surviving neurons (37% survival) in JNK3-deficient mice under the same conditions (Fig. 1D). JNK2-deficient nuclei were slightly more resistant to death than JNK3-deficient neurons (43% survival). Interestingly, while JNK2/3 double-deficient mice showed the best protection (52% survival), the protection was not synergistic or even additive in nature. In the uninjured control nucleus, healthy neurons displayed centrally located nucleus and dark nissl staining of the cytoplasm. In contrast, dying neurons of control animals showed pyknotic nuclei and loss of Nissl staining. This was partially reversed in JNK3-, JNK2-, and JNK2/3-deficient animals (Fig. 1). Taken together, these data indicate that both JNK3 and JNK2 play roles in neonatal facial axotomy induced death of motor neurons. JNK3 Modulation of Motor Neuron Death Occurs Independently of c-Jun Phosphorylation—We next determined whether JNK2 or JNK3 deficiency mediated protection is accompanied by reduced c-Jun phosphorylation and activation as reported in other neuronal death paradigms (for example, Refs. 9Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Yang D.D. Liao G. Schloemer A.J. Dong C. Bao J. Banasiak K.J. Haddad G.G. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15184-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar and 11Hunot S. Vila M. Teismann P. Davis R.J. Hirsch E.C. Przedborski S. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 665-670Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar)). We first examined c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63 using a phospho-Ser63-specific antibody. An increase in the number of Ser63 c-Jun-positive neurons was detected 24 h following axotomy in the ipsilateral axotomized side when compared with non-axotomized contralateral nuclei in wild-type mice (Fig. 2). This increase was not apparent 4 days following axotomy as expected due to the death of axotomized facial neurons at this time (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, the basal level of phospho c-Jun positive neurons in the contralateral side was slightly elevated at 24 h in comparison to 4 days. This is likely due to indirect effects of the axotomy on the contralateral control nucleus. Consistent with previous reports (9Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Yang D.D. Liao G. Schloemer A.J. Dong C. Bao J. Banasiak K.J. Haddad G.G. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15184-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 11Hunot S. Vila M. Teismann P. Davis R.J. Hirsch E.C. Przedborski S. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 665-670Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar), JNK2 deficiency mediated neuroprotection was accompanied by reduced number of phospho c-Jun-positive neurons (Fig. 2, A and B). The number of phospho-c-Jun-positive neurons was elevated in JNK2-deficient mice at 4 days in comparison to wild-type mice as one would expect from an increased number of surviving neurons. It was also elevated in comparison to the contralateral side at 4 days, suggesting that Ser63 c-Jun phosphorylation is sustained, albeit at lower levels than at 24 h. JNK2/3 double-deficient mice showed further reduced Ser63 c-Jun phosphorylation in comparison to JNK2 alone (Fig. 2, A and B), reflecting the protection observed (Fig. 1). In this case, the number of Ser63 c-Jun-positive neurons was reduced down to levels observed on the contralateral side at 24 h, suggesting that a combination of JNK2 and -3 are important for the c-Jun phosphorylation increase observed following axotomy. Surprisingly, however, JNK3 deficiency alone failed to reduce the number of Ser63 c-Jun-positive neurons at 24 h. There was no significant difference between JNK3-deficient and wild-type mice in Ser63 phosphorylation at 24 h. This finding contrasts to that of JNK2 or JNK2/3 double-deficient neurons. While the above observations indicated that JNK3 deficiency alone did not affect the total number of Ser63-positive neurons, we examined whether JNK3 deficiency might affect the overall intensity (per neuron) of c-Jun phosphorylation. To examine this, we performed densitometric analyses of Ser63-positive neurons in the different animal groups (Fig. 2C). In wild-type animals, the average intensity of Ser63 staining was elevated following axotomy at 24 h. While this intensity was reduced in JNK2- or JNK2/3-deficient nuclei following axotomy at 24 h, JNK3-deficient nuclei showed no such reduction. Similarly, total Ser63 phosphorylation activity, as defined by the number of positive neurons multiplied by average intensity of each neuron, was also not affected in JNK3-deficient facial nuclei (Fig. 2D) when compared with wild-type mice (24 h). In contrast, JNK2 or JNK2/3 deficiency significantly reduced total Ser63 c-Jun phosphorylation activity. At 4 days, the intensity of Ser63 staining was still sustained when compared with the contralateral side. However, there was no difference between any of the groups. c-Jun, depending upon the context, may be differentially phosphorylated at the two major phosphorylation sites of c-Jun. For example, following medial forebrain axotomy in the adult rat, Ser73 phosphorylation and not Ser63 phosphorylation is observed (7Crocker S.J. Lamba W.R. Smith P.D. Callaghan S.M. Slack R.S. Anisman H. Park D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13385-13390Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we also evaluated phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser73. Similar to that observed with Ser63 phosphoepitope-specific antibody, we observed an increase in levels of Ser73 c-Jun phosphorylation in axotomized control mice, which did not differ from that observed with JNK3-knockout mice (Fig. 3). Like with Ser63, Ser73 phosphorylation was negatively impacted by JNK2 or JNK2/3 deficiency. Finally, we determined whether c-Jun levels by itself may be regulated by JNK deficiency. As shown in Fig. 4, there were relatively high basal levels of c-Jun in the contralateral nuclei at both 24 and 4 days and a modest increase in numbers (148 ipsi versus 104 contra) and intensity (109 ipsi versus 74 contra) of c-Jun at 24 h. Similar to that observed with Ser63 or Ser73 c-Jun phosphorylation, this increase was not affected by JNK3 deficiency while JNK2 or JNK2/3 double-deficient mice showed reduced c-Jun levels. Taken together, these data indicate that JNK3-mediated protection is not correlated with a reduction in c-Jun activation. Most importantly, these data indicate that c-Jun activation per se is not the only JNK-mediated signal required for facial axotomy-induced death. Because protection afforded by JNK3 deficiency was not accompanied by reduced c-Jun phosphorylation following facial axotomy, we asked whether other potential JNK targets may be modulated and required for neuronal death. We examined additional select transcription factors, ATF2 and Elk1, which are also regulated by the JNKs (39Cesari F. Brecht S. Vintersten K. Vuong L.G. Hofmann M. Klingel K. Schnorr J. Arsenian S.

Herdegen T. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 62: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect any increased phosphorylation or induction of these factors following axotomy 24 h following axotomy when c-Jun activation was pronounced (data not shown). Evaluations of potential induction in these cases were performed by immunofluorescent analyses utilizing ATF2 and ELK1 antibodies or phosphospecific antibodies recognizing activated ATF2 and Elk1. In fact, the phospho-ATF2 and phospho-Elk1 signals decreased 24 h following axotomy on the ipsilateral side consistent with what has previously been reported in other neuronal stress situations"

This can explain the virtual absence of RAS mutations in some types of tumors, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We report that in the CML cell line K562 Ras induces p21Cip1 expression through the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Because K562 cells are deficient for p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p14ARF, and p53, this would be the main mechanism whereby Ras up-regulates p21 expression in these cells. Accordingly, we also found that Ras suppresses K562 growth by signaling through the Raf-ERK pathway. Because c-Myc and Ras cooperate in cell transformation and c-Myc is up-regulated in CML, we investigated the effect of c-Myc on Ras activity in K562 cells. c-Myc antagonized the induction of p21Cip1 mediated by oncogenic H-, K-, and N-Ras and by constitutively activated Raf and ERK2. Activation of the p21Cip1 promoter by Ras was dependent on Sp1/3 binding sites in K562. However, mutational analysis of the p21 promoter and the use of a Gal4-Sp1 chimeric protein strongly suggest that c-Myc affects Sp1 transcriptional activity but not the binding of Sp1 to the p21 promoter. c-Myc-mediated impairment of Ras activity on p21 expression required a transactivation domain, a DNA binding region, and a Max binding region. Moreover, the effect was independent of Miz1 binding to c-Myc. Consistent with its effect on p21Cip1 expression, c-Myc rescued cell growth inhibition induced by Ras. The data suggest that in particular tumor types, such as those associated with CML, c-Myc contributes to tumorigenesis by inhibiting Ras antiproliferative activity.

The Ras family of small GTPases includes three closely related proteins, namely H-, K-, and N-Ras. Ras proteins are activated by signals originating in surface receptors and act as key components of signaling pathways by relaying signals downstream through diverse routes. Activated RAS proteins interact with signaling effectors that, in mammalian cells, include Raf kinases (c-Raf-1, A-Raf, and B-Raf), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HLH, helix-loop-helix; Luc, luciferase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase.1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HLH, helix-loop-helix; Luc, luciferase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase.

But the involvement of Ras in the upbringing of human cancer is a topic of hot debate, as the incidence of mutations and the particular isoform mutated varies greatly depending on the origin and the type of tumor. In this respect it has been an enigmatic finding that Ras mutations, particularly those in NRAS, are relatively frequent in acute myeloid leukemia (20–45% of the cases), whereas they are practically absent in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) even in the blastic phase of the disease, despite the biological similarity between CML and acute myeloid leukemia blasts (6Watzinger F.

Whereas Ras constitutive activation induces oncogene-like transformation in immortalized fibroblasts, high Ras activity levels causes growth arrest and premature senescence in murine and human primary fibroblasts (9Lin A.W.

Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1613-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Whereas the antiproliferative response to activated Ras has been mainly studied in primary cells, it has been much less studied in transformed cells, and its relevance to human cancer remains largely unknown. The antiproliferative effect of Ras is achieved through at least three mechanisms that impinge on cell cycle regulation (11Crespo P. Leon J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1613-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d887-d912Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 13Pearson G.

(a) H-Ras and Raf up-regulate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16INK4a and p15INK4b, thus blocking RB phosphorylation and G1 progression. (b) Ras up-regulates p14ARF, which inactivates Mdm2, leading to p53 up-regulation. As p53 is a potent activator of the cyclin-dependent kinases inhibitor p21Cip1 (termed p21 hereafter), it is believed that p21 contributes importantly to the cell cycle arrest brought about by Ras. (c) We have previously demonstrated that Ras also induces growth arrest and p21 up-regulation in K562 cells, which lack p16INK4a and p15INK4b p14ARF, and p53, thus revealing a third mechanism for the Ras antiproliferative effect (14Delgado M.D. Vaque J.P. Arozarena I. Lopez-Ilasaca M.A. Martinez C. Crespo P. Leon J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In rodent fibroblasts it has been shown that high levels of constitutively active Raf and MEK can activate p21 expression per se, indicating that, at the least, the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway can bring about p21 up-regulation (15Westbrook T.F.

However, it is currently unknown which effector signaling pathways are utilized by Ras to activate p21 expression in human cells. This issue has acquired relevance in view of a recent finding indicating that Ras-mediated transformation pathways differ in human and mouse cells (18Hamad N.M. Elconin J.H. Karnoub A.E. Bai W.

However, the functional interaction between c-Myc and Ras in cells where Ras activation results in antiproliferative effects, such as in CML cells, has received little attention. To this end, herein we have investigated the pathways used by Ras for growth arrest and p21 induction in K562 cells and the effects of c-Myc on Ras-mediated effects. We report that Ras inhibits growth and activates the p21 promoter through the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in K562, this being the main pathway for Ras-dependent activation of the p21 gene operating in these cells. We also demonstrate that in K562 cells both Ras-induced transactivation of p21 and growth inhibition can be abrogated by c-Myc. Thus, although c-Myc cooperates with Ras, resulting in the transformation of cells in which Ras displays mitogenic activity, it antagonizes Ras function in cellular models where Ras exerts antiproliferative effects.

Immunofluorescence Analyses—K562/S cells grown on coverslips were transfected with 0.2 μg of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector (pEGFP-N2, Clontech) and 2 μg of Ras or p21 expression (pCEFL-p21) vectors using FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 36 h after transfection, the cells were fixed for 10 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Then cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with the secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After several washes, cells were mounted in Vectashield medium (Vector Labs). The antibodies used were rabbit anti-p21 (C19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Ras (C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an antibody Texas Red-conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG (1:150 in phosphate-buffered saline; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Images were obtained with a confocal laser microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 1024). Western Blots—Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer, and 50 μgof protein were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by standard procedures. Ras proteins were detected with anti-H-Ras polyclonal antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology.). Bcl-2 was detected using the anti-Bcl-2 rabbit antibody (C-7; BD Transduction Laboratories). As a loading control, α-tubulin was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (provided by Nicholas Cowan, New York University Medical Center). Immunoblots were revealed by chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham Biosciences). Ras Induces Nuclear p21 Expression—We have previously located the Ras-responsive region of the human p21 promoter in a 210 bp region upstream of the transcription initiation site (14Delgado M.D. Vaque J.P. Arozarena I. Lopez-Ilasaca M.A. Martinez C. Crespo P. Leon J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This region contains several Sp1/3 binding sites as well as AP2 and E2F sites (55Gartel A.L. Goufman E. Tevosian S.G. Shih H. Yee A.S. Tyner A.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3463-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have used a luciferase reporter construct harboring this promoter zone (p21-Luc) to elucidate which effectors are involved in the regulation of p21 expression by Ras. We first tested the functionality of this reporter with increasing Ras dosages in luciferase assays in K562 cells. The results (Fig. 1A) showed that p21 promoter activity increased in proportion with the amount of the Ras expression vector transfected. Taking into consideration that only nuclear p21 seems to be able to promote growth arrest (56Coqueret O. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 65-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), we next asked whether the p21 protein generated as a consequence of Ras activity was actually located in the nucleus. For this purpose, K562/S cells (an adherent K562 derivative) were transfected with H-Ras-G12V in addition to a GFP expression vector to identify transfected cells. The localization of p21, as detected by indirect immunofluorescence, showed that the p21 protein was expressed as a result of Ras activity specifically localized to the nucleus, as demonstrated by co-localization with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (Fig. 1B). Ras Induces p21 Expression through the RAF-MEK-ERK Pathway—To elucidate the signaling pathway(s) through which Ras induces p21 in K562, we tested Ras effector domain mutants that specifically interact with a defined effector molecule. These mutants carry the oncogenic mutation G12V and an additional mutation in the effector domain. Thus, the mutant proteins Ras-G12V-T35S and Ras-G12V-D38E are known to signal only through Raf, whereas Ras-G12V-Y40C only activates PI3K and Ras-G12V-E37G can only signal through RAL-guanine nucleotide exchange factors or NORE (4Khokhlatchev A.

We first assessed by immunoblot that the five Ras vectors directed the expression of the corresponding proteins to similar levels upon transfection in K562/S cells (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that these mutant Ras proteins localized in the previously described subcellular locations for H-Ras (plasma membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi) (57Arozarena I. Matallanas D. Berciano M.T. Sanz-Moreno V. Calvo F. Munoz M.T. Egea G. Lafarga M. Crespo P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1516-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 58Chiu V.K. Bivona T.

Next, K562 cells were transfected with these effector-specific Ras mutants along with the p21-Luc reporter. It was found that only Ras-G12V-T35S and Ras-G12V-D38E were able to significantly activate the p21 reporter (Fig. 2B). By contrast, Ras-G12V-E37G and Ras-G12V-Y40C did not activate the p21 promoter above the levels observed in empty vector-transfected cells. We next sought to confirm the effects of Ras mutants on p21 protein expression using indirect immunofluorescence in transfected cells. In agreement with the results observed utilizing p21 promoter activation as readout, we found that only Ras-G12V and the mutants that signal through Raf (Ras-G12V-T35S and Ras-G12V-D38E) induced a significant expression of nuclear p21 (48–35% of the transfected cells), whereas Ras-G12V-D37G and Ras-G12V-Y40C only resulted in ∼ 11% of p21-positive cells (Fig. 2C). The former results suggested that Ras activates the p21 promoter predominantly through the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. We sought to confirm this point by examining the effect of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 in p21 promoter activation induced by Ras. As shown in Fig. 2D, a gradual increase in PD98059 concentration resulted in a subsequent decrease in p21 promoter activation. In contrast, treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not impair Ras-mediated transactivation of p21 (not shown). Moreover, the incubation of Ras-G12V-transfected cells with PD98059 also reduced dramatically the number of p21-expressing cells (Fig. 2C). These results added further support to the idea that Ras induces p21 expression predominantly by activating the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. To further confirm this point, we tested whether activated constituents of the ERK pathway could also activate the p21 promoter in K562 cells. First, we transfected K562 with an expression vector for Raf-BXB, a constitutively active Raf 1 mutant that carries a deletion in the N-terminal regulatory domain (41Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). As expected, Raf-BXB also elicited a potent activation of the p21 promoter (Fig. 2E). We also tested p21 transcriptional activation dependence on ERK activity. For this purpose, we utilized vectors encoding for ERK2 fused in tandem with MEK1, a fusion that renders ERK2 constitutively active (43Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two versions were utilized, namely ERK2-MEK1, which locates to the cytoplasm, and ERK2-MEK1-AL, a mutant form in which four leucine residues in the MEK1 nuclear export signal had been mutated to alanines, thereby exhibiting a predominant localization to the nucleus (43Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted localization of the proteins encoded by both vectors has been confirmed previously in K562 cells (62Ajenjo N. Canon E. Sanchez-Perez I. Matallanas D. Leon J. Perona R. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32813-32823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We found that ERK2-MEK1-AL potently activated the p21 reporter, which, on the other hand, was unaffected by the cytoplasmic ERK2-MEK1 (Fig. 2E). These results indicated that ERK was capable to induce p21 expression only upon translocation to the nucleus. Taken together, the above results strongly suggest that R"
https://openalex.org/W2092992049,"The ternary complex factors (TCF) are a subfamily of ETS domain transcription factors that bind and activate serum response elements (SREs) in the promoters of target genes in a ternary complex with a second transcription factor, serum response factor (SRF). Here, we have identified the <i>SRF</i> gene as a target for the TCFs, thereby providing a positive feedback loop whereby TCF activation leads to the enhancement of the expression of its partner protein SRF. The binding of the TCF Elk-1 to the <i>SRF</i> promoter and subsequent regulation of <i>SRF</i> expression occurs in a ternary complex-dependent manner. Our data therefore reveal that <i>SRF</i> is an important target for the ERK and Rho signaling pathways that converge on a ternary TCF-SRF complex at the SRE on the <i>SRF</i> promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2072092572,"Nitrosation is an important reaction elicited by nitric oxide (NO). To better understand how nitrosation occurs in biological systems, we assessed the effect of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a mediator of inflammation, on nitrosation observed during NO autoxidation. Nitrosation of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ; 10 μm) to 2-nitrosoamino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (N-NO-IQ) was monitored by HPLC. Using the NO donor spermine NONOate at pH 7.4, MPO potentiated N-NO-IQ formation. The minimum effective quantity of necessary components was 8.5 nm MPO, 0.25 μm H2O2/min, and 0.024 μm NO/min. Autoxidation was only detected at ≥1.2 μm NO/min. MPO potentiation was not affected by a 40-fold excess flux of H2O2 over NO or less than a 2.4-fold excess flux of NO over H2O2. Potentiation was due to an 8.8-fold increased affinity of MPO-derived nitrosating species for IQ. Autoxidation was inhibited by azide, suggesting involvement of the nitrosonium ion, NO+. MPO potentiation was inhibited by NADH, but not azide, suggesting oxidative nitrosylation with NO2⋅ or an NO2⋅-like species. MPO nonnitrosative oxidation of IQ with 0.3 mm NO2− at pH 5.5 was inhibited by azide, but not NADH, demonstrating differences between MPO oxidation of IQ with NO compared with NO2−. Using phorbol ester-stimulated human neutrophils, N-NO-IQ formation was increased with superoxide dismutase and inhibited by catalase and NADH, but not NaN3. This is consistent with nitrosation potentiation by MPO, not peroxynitrite. Increased N-NO-IQ formation was not detected with polymorphonuclear neutrophils from two unrelated MPO-deficient patients. Results suggest that the highly diffusible stable gas NO could initiate nitrosation at sites of neutrophil infiltration. Nitrosation is an important reaction elicited by nitric oxide (NO).

Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar). Impaired responses are observed with excessive production of NO in pathological conditions associated with chronic inflammation. Effects of NO can be divided into direct and indirect (2Grisham M.B. Jourd'Heuil D. Wink D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 39: G315-G321Google Scholar). Direct effects of NO are mediated by low nanomolar concentrations of NO and are illustrated by its binding to guanylate cyclase and eliciting numerous effects, including smooth muscle relaxation. In contrast, indirect effects occur at higher concentrations of NO and result from the reaction of NO with either oxygen (autoxidation) or superoxide to produce reactive nitrogen oxygen species (RNOS). Indirect effects of NO elicited by RNOS include nitrosation, oxidation, and nitration reactions with numerous biological targets representing lipids, proteins, and DNA (2Grisham M.B. Jourd'Heuil D. Wink D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 39: G315-G321Google Scholar). This can cause lipid peroxidation, inhibition of enzymes, and deamination of DNA. Autoxidation of NO results in the formation of N2O3, which yields the nitrosonium ion, NO+ (3Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar, 4Lewis R.S. Deen W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 568-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The latter is a potent nitrosating agent. Autoxidation is slow and considered unlikely to occur in biological systems because NO can be rapidly inactivated. For example, NO is removed from the vascular compartment by near diffusion-limited interaction with erythrocyte oxyhemoglobin, yielding ferric hemoglobin and nitrate (5Eich R.F. Li T. Lemon D.D. Doherty D.H. Curry S.R. Aitken J.F. Mathews A.J. Johnson K.A. Smith R.D. Phillips G.N. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6976-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). However, significant amounts of S-, N-, and heme-nitros(yl)ation are detected in vivo, suggesting that modes of nitrosation other than by autoxidation must exist (6Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'Heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 7Rassaf T. Bryan N.S. Kelm M. Feelisch M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1590-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). NO is a physiologic substrate for several mammalian peroxidases, including myeloperoxidase (MPO) (8Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37524-37532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Direct spectroscopic and rapid kinetic studies support a facile reaction between peroxidases and NO (8Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37524-37532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 9Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5425-5430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Peroxidases may play an important role in attenuating direct effects of NO. Organ chamber studies with preconstricted vascular and tracheal rings have demonstrated that catalytic amounts of peroxidase hydrolyzed NO (10Abu-Soud H.M. Khassawneh M.Y. Sohn J.T. Murray P. Haxhiu M.A. Hazen S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11866-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This prevented smooth muscle relaxation and NO-mediated ring dilation. A subsequent study further emphasized the role of MPO as a leukocyte-derived NO oxidase (11Eiserich J.P. Baldus S. Brennan M.L. Ma W. Zhang C. Tousson A. Castro L. Lusis A.J. Nauseef W.M. White C.R. Freeman B.A. Science. 2002; 296: 2391-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The product of MPO metabolism of NO is thought to be NO+ (8Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37524-37532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, little consideration has been given to the possible role of MPO-derived NO+ in biologically important nitrosations. Cellular nitrosation has been demonstrated to be distinct from that catalyzed by NO autoxidation in aqueous solution. Experiments, using an oxidant to convert NO directly to NO2⋅, demonstrated that this RNOS facilitates nitrosation by combining with NO to form N2O3 (12Espey M.G. Miranda K.M. Thomas D.D. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30085-30091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). NO2⋅-mediated nitrosation was shown to be similar to that observed in cells. We have recently demonstrated RNOS nitrosation of the colon carcinogen 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), forming 2-nitrosoamino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (N-NO-IQ) (13Lakshmi V.M. Hsu F.F. Zenser T.V. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The latter binds DNA and is mutagenic. In this study, we have used IQ as a target for evaluating MPO potentiation of NO-mediated nitros(yl)ation. In view of the potential close temporal and spatial association between NO formation (inducible nitric-oxide synthase), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formation, and MPO during an inflammatory response, a better understanding of NO-mediated nitros(yl)ation may improve treatment and aid in prevention of inflammation-related diseases (i.e. certain cancers, atherosclerosis, and asthma).

The rate of SpN decomposition was unaltered in reaction mixtures demonstrating potentiation of N-NO-IQ formation by MPO (Fig. 1, lower panel). Rather than adding a bolus of reagent H2O2, it was generated in situ, using d-glucose and glucose oxidase. H2O2 was measured by MPO and 3,5,3′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (ϵ652 = 3.9 × 104 m–1) (15Josephy P.D. Eling T. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

The reaction was started by the addition of SpN, and tubes capped. Blank values were obtained in the absence of SpN. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 mm ascorbic acid in dimethylformamide (0.05 ml). Samples were immediately frozen and kept at –70 °C for analysis by HPLC mobile phase 1 (13Lakshmi V.M.

HPLC Analysis of Metabolites—Metabolites were assessed using a Beckman HPLC with System Gold software and a 5-μm, 4.6 × 150-mm C-18 ultrasphere column attached to a guard column. The mobile phase contained either 20 mm ammonium formate buffer (pH 3.1; mobile phase 1) or 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.0; mobile phase 2) in 8% acetonitrile, 0–2 min; 8–16%, 2–10 min; 16–21%, 13–18 min; 21–35%, 18–23 min; 35–8%, 30–35 min; flow rate 1 ml/min. Radioactivity in HPLC eluents was measured using a FLO-ONE radioactive flow detector. Data are expressed as a percentage of total radioactivity or pmol recovered by HPLC. Preparation of Human Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils (PMNs)— Human blood from healthy donors was mixed with EDTA (0.2% final concentration) and immediately layered over an equal volume of neutrophil isolation medium from Robins Scientific Corp. (Sunnyvale, CA). Neutrophils were isolated by centrifugation using the manufacturer's specifications. Red blood cell contamination was eliminated by hypotonic lysis at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution with calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate. All protocols were in accordance with institutional guidelines on research involving human subjects of either the St. Louis VA Medical Center or the University of Iowa. All participants gave written informed consent. For experiments with MPO-deficient patients, blood was collected in lithium heparin tubes and shipped overnight for analysis the next day. A normal healthy control sample of blood was drawn and included in the shipment. Neutrophils were isolated by a two-step procedure. First red blood cells were removed by dextran sedimentation, Mr 200,000–300,000 (MP-Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Neutrophils were isolated from the supernatant following Ficoll-Hypaque Plus (Amersham Biosciences) gradient centrifugation. Neutrophils were resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution with calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate. Molecular characteristics of the two MPO-deficient patients have been reported (17Nauseef W.M. Cogley M. McCormick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9546-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Nauseef W.M. Cogley M. Bock S. Petrides P.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Metabolism of IQ by Neutrophils—Neutrophils (0.3 × 106 cells in 0.3 ml) were incubated with 0.01 mm [14C]IQ in 12 × 75-mm polypropylene tubes at 37 °C for 36 min in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate without phenol red. Where indicated, 0.054 mm PMA, 1.2 μm NO/min (0.05 mm SpN), 1 mm NaN3, and 0.1 mm NADH were added at 5, 6, 8, and 8 min, respectively, whereas 66 μg/ml catalase and 66 μg/ml SOD were present at zero time. Blank values were obtained in the absence of SpN. The reaction was stopped by placing on ice and freezing at –70 °C. Samples were sonicated for 15 s three times, and 0.3 ml of dimethylformamide containing 2 mm ascorbic acid was added. Samples were spun at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was evaporated, and residue was dissolved in 0.1 ml of methanol/dimethylformamide (8:2) and analyzed by HPLC with mobile phase 1. The oxidant burst response was measured for each PMN preparation (19Babior B.M. Kipnes R.S. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). Superoxide generation was activated by the addition of PMA. Superoxide-specific reduction of cytochrome c was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ550 = 21.1 mm–1 cm–1) and was inhibited by superoxide dismutase (10 μg/ml). Values observed with cells in the absence of PMA were considered as blanks. To assess the authenticity of neutrophil-derived N-NO-IQ, selected supernatants were pooled after HPLC analysis, evaporated to dryness, and converted to either 2-azido-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (2-N3-IQ) or 2-chloro-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (2-Cl-IQ) derivatives. For 2-N3-IQ, pH 2.0, ammonium formate was added along with 10 mm NaN3. After 60 min at 37 °C, the pH was adjusted to pH 7.0–7.4. For 2-Cl-IQ, the residue was dissolved in 0.18 ml of acetonitrile, and 0.02 ml of 1 n HCl was added for 30 min at 37 °C and then neutralized with 1 n NH4OH. Authentic N-NO-IQ (98% pure) was treated in a similar manner to prepare standards. A recent study has verified the structure of these compounds (20Lakshmi V.M. Hsu F.F. Zenser T.V. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by HPLC on mobile phase 1 and 2. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as a mean ± S.E., and significant differences were evaluated using Student's paired t test with p < 0.05. MPO Potentiation of NO-mediated Nitrosation—MPO was evaluated to determine its effect on NO-mediated nitrosation of IQ (Fig. 1). Previous studies have demonstrated significant transformation of IQ to a stable N-nitroso product, N-NO-IQ, during autoxidation of NO, using a high flux of NO (∼30 μm NO/min, 0.1 mm diethylamine NONOate) (13Lakshmi V.M. Hsu F.F. Zenser T.V. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, using a flux of NO more likely to occur during inflammation (2.4 μm/min, 0.1 mm SpN), N-NO-IQ formation due to autoxidation (0.2 μm) was near the limit of detection, 1.6% of the total radioactivity recovered by HPLC (Fig. 1, top). In the absence of NO, MPO (85 nm) and H2O2 (10 μm/min H2O2) did not catalyze N-NO-IQ formation or metabolize IQ (Fig. 1, middle). When incubation mixtures contained NO, MPO, and H2O2, significant N-NO-IQ formation (3.1 μm) was detected, 31% of the total radioactivity recovered by HPLC (Fig. 1, bottom). N-NO-IQ formation during the autoxidation of NO was not affected by 10 μm H2O2/min. However, H2O2 is required for the potentiation of N-nitroso formation observed with NO/MPO/H2O2. Using conditions illustrated in the bottom panel, N-NO-IQ formation was linear for at least 60 min. Thus, catalytic amounts of MPO potentiate NO-mediated IQ nitrosation. Effect of MPO Concentration, Fluxes of H2O2 and NO, and Concentrations of IQ on NO Nitrosation—MPO concentration dependent potentiation of NO-mediated IQ nitrosation was evaluated with a constant flux of NO (2.4 μm/min) and H2O2 (10 μm/min) (Fig. 2). Using the conditions illustrated in Fig. 1 (bottom), a range of MPO concentrations from 0 to 170 nm was evaluated. N-NO-IQ formation by autoxidation was significantly increased from 16 ± 2to53 ± 5 pmol (p < 0.05) with 8.5 nm MPO. A linear increase in N-NO-IQ formation was observed from 2.8 to 170 nm MPO. Thus, in the presence of a low flux of NO, MPO elicits a concentration-dependent increase in IQ nitrosation. To investigate MPO potentiation of NO-mediated IQ nitrosation in more detail, N-NO-IQ formation was evaluated with increasing fluxes of H2O2, 0–20 μm/min, in the presence of a constant flux of NO (0.48 μm/min, 0.02 mm SpN) (Fig. 3). Significant increases in N-NO-IQ formation were observed at 0.25 μm H2O2/min (p < 0.05), with maximum increases observed at 10 μm/min. Fluxes of H2O2 (20 μm/min) 40-fold greater than NO did not decrease N-NO-IQ formation. Thus, MPO potentiation of nitrosation was observed at high as well as low fluxes of H2O2. IQ nitrosation was also assessed at varied fluxes of NO (0–0.48 μm/min) in the presence of constant H2O2 production (10 μm/min) (Fig. 4). With MPO and H2O2, N-NO-IQ formation was not detected in the absence of NO or with 0.012 μm NO/min. N-NO-IQ formation was detected with 0.024 μm NO/min and continued to increase from 0.012 to 0.48 μm NO/min. Formation of N-NO-IQ was similar, with fluxes of NO from 0.48 to 2.4 μm/min (not shown). At 0.24 μm NO/min, the efficiency of N-NO-IQ formation (0.038 μm/min) was 16%. Nitrosation of IQ elicited by NO autoxidation was not detected with the fluxes of NO evaluated. Thus, with MPO and H2O2, low fluxes of NO exhibited a dose-responsive increase in IQ nitrosation. MPO potentiation was evaluated with NO fluxes in excess of H2O2 (Fig. 5). N-NO-IQ formation was assessed with increasing fluxes of NO (0.6 to 9.6 μm/min) in the presence and absence of MPO and H2O2 (1 μm/min). From 0.6 and 9.6 μm NO/min, a general increase in N-NO-IQ formation was observed with MPO. N-NO-IQ formation due to autoxidation was observed at fluxes of NO ≥1.2 μm. MPO potentiation is expressed in Fig. 5 as the difference between values observed with MPO minus values observed in its absence (control). Potentiation gradually decreased over the range of NO fluxes assessed with significant decreases observed at all fluxes of NO ≥2.4 μm/min. Thus, MPO potentiation is sensitive to fluxes of NO greater than H2O2 with a ≥2.4-fold excess inhibitory. Nitrosation of IQ illustrated in Fig. 1 (top and bottom) was evaluated kinetically over a range of IQ concentrations (0.005–0.080 mm) (Fig. 6). Keeping the flux of NO constant (2.4 μm/min), N-NO-IQ formation was evaluated in the presence and absence of MPO (85 nm) and H2O2 (10 μm/min). The affinities of nitrosating species produced by NO for IQ were greater in the presence of MPO/H2O2 (–1/Xint = 21 + 2 μm) than with NO alone by autoxidation (–1/Xint = 189 + 3 μm). By contrast at infinite concentrations of IQ, the maximal rates of N-NO-IQ formation were similar with MPO/H2O2 (1/Yint = 24 + 3 pmol/min) and autoxidation (1/Yint = 28 + 1 pmol/min). Thus, potentiation of NO-mediated IQ nitrosation is due to increased affinity of MPO-derived RNOS for IQ. Inhibition of NO and MPO Potentiation of NO Nitrosation—To assess N-NO-IQ formation mediated by NO autoxidation, a high NO flux (9.6 μm/min) was necessary to test different agents (Table I). Autoxidation of IQ was not significantly altered by 100 mm NaCl, 33 μg/ml catalase, or 33 μg/ml SOD. Complete inhibition of N-NO-IQ formation was observed with 0.3 mm ascorbic acid. NaN3 (1 mm), NADH (0.1 mm), and DMPO (30 mm) decreased N-NO-IQ formation 70, 73, and 56%, respectively. With 0.48 μm NO/min and 10 μm/min H2O2, these same agents characterized MPO potentiation of N-NO-IQ formation. MPO potentiation was not significantly altered by 1 mm NaN3, 100 mm NaCl, or 33 μg/ml SOD. Complete inhibition was observed with 0.1 mm NADH, 0.3 mm ascorbic acid, and 33 μg/ml catalase. DMPO (30 mm) decreased N-NO-IQ formation 78%. Test agents did not affect the half-life of SpN. Thus, N-NO-IQ formation mediated by NO and potentiated by MPO have different sensitivities to the selected test agents, suggesting different mechanisms of N-NO-IQ formation.Table IEffect of test agents on N-NO-IQ formation by NO with and without MPOConditionN-NO-IQPercentage of totalpmol%SpN99 ± 5100 + 1 mm NaN330 ± 4bp < 0.03 versus SpN.30 + 0.1 mm NADH27 ± 6bp < 0.03 versus SpN.27 + 100 mm NaCl83 ± 584 + 0.3 mm ascorbic acidNDaND, not detected.0 + 33 μg/ml catalase80 ± 181 + 33 μg/ml SOD104 ± 10105 + 30 mm DMPO44 ± 6bp < 0.03 versus SpN.44SpN + MPO210 ± 15100 + 1 mm NaN3187 ± 389 + 0.1 mm NADHND0 + 100 mm NaCl185 ± 388 + 0.3 mm ascorbic acidND0 + 33 μg/ml catalaseND0 + 33 μg/ml SOD138 ± 1266 + 30 mm DMPO47 ± 1cp < 0.03 versus SpN + MPO.22a ND, not detected.b p < 0.03 versus SpN.c p < 0.03 versus SpN + MPO. Open table in a new tab Inhibition of MPO Nonnitrosative Oxidation—To help interpret the effects of test agents in Table I, the same test agents were used to evaluate MPO nonnitrosative oxidation of IQ (Table II). This oxidation of IQ at pH 5.5 requires not only H2O2, but also NO2− (13Lakshmi V.M. Hsu F.F. Zenser T.V. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A previous study identified these products of IQ oxidation by MPO as NO2-IQ1, NO2-IQ2, and IQ dimer. NaN3 (0.3 mm) and ascorbic acid (0.3 mm) completely inhibited the formation of all three products, whereas DMPO (30 mm) significantly reduced their formation. With NADH (0.1 mm), the formation of NO2-IQ1 and NO2-IQ2 was reduced, but not significantly. NaCl (100 mm) reduced the formation of all three products, but only NO2-IQ1 and NO2-IQ2 were significantly reduced. Catalase elicited complete inhibition of all products (not shown). These test agents reveal important differences in the mechanism by which MPO oxidizes IQ with NO (Table I) and oxidizes IQ with NO2−, an end product of NO metabolism (Table II).Table IIEffect of test agents on MPO nonnitrosative oxidation of IQConditionsNO2-IQ1NO2-IQ2IQ dimerpmolComplete413 ± 23227 ± 1580 ± 6 + 0.3 mm NaN3NDaND, not detected.NDND + 0.1 mm NADH337 ± 35200 ± 680 ± 6 + 100 mm NaCl143 ± 8bp < 0.02 versus complete.85 + 5bp < 0.02 versus complete.63 ± 13 + 0.3 mm ascorbic acidNDNDND + 30 mm DMPO52 ± 6bp < 0.02 versus complete.43 ± 5bp < 0.02 versus complete.NDa ND, not detected.b p < 0.02 versus complete. Open table in a new tab NO-mediated Nitrosation with Human PMNs—To assess the significance of MPO potentiation of NO-mediated IQ nitrosation, N-NO-IQ formation by human PMNs was assessed (Table III). Cells were incubated with 0.01 mm IQ and 1.2 μm NO/min (Fig. 7, top). In the absence of PMA, the amount of N-NO-IQ formed was similar to that observed in the absence of cells (not shown). PMA increased N-NO-IQ formation 2.7-fold. This increase was prevented by 66 μg/ml catalase. Values observed with PMA were further increased by the presence of 66 μg/ml SOD (2-fold) (Fig. 7, middle). Catalase and NADH, but not azide, suppressed the increase observed with PMA and SOD. To assess the authenticity of N-NO-IQ, neutrophil-derived N-NO-IQ was converted to 2-N3-IQ by pH 2.0/10 mm NaN3 treatment. As illustrated in Fig. 7 (bottom), this treatment resulted in the disappearance of the N-NO-IQ peak observed in Fig. 7 (middle panel) at 10.2 min and the appearance of a new peak at 15.5 min, 2-N3-IQ. Synthetic 2-N3-IQ standard also eluted at 15.5 min. The yield of 2-N3-IQ was 52%. The elution time of neutrophil-derived and synthetic 2-N3-IQ was identical on a different HPLC solvent system. In addition, treatment of neutrophil-derived N-NO-IQ with 1 n HCl produced 2-Cl-IQ. Neutrophil-derived and synthetic 2-Cl-IQ were shown to have identical elution times on two different HPLC solvent systems. This confirms the formation of N-NO-IQ by PMA-stimulated neutrophils exposed to a constant low flux of NO. Results with human neutrophils are consistent with MPO potentiation of NO-mediated IQ nitrosation.Table IIIFormation of N-NO-IQ by human PMNsConditionsN-NO-IQpmolNeutrophils18 ± 3 + 0.05 mm PMA48 ± 5ap < 0.001 versus neutrophils. + 0.05 mm PMA + 66 μg/ml catalase22 ± 9bp < 0.003 versus PMA. + 0.05 mm PMA + 66 μg/ml SOD99 ± 14bp < 0.003 versus PMA. + 0.05 mm PMA + 66 μg/ml SOD + 66 μg/ml catalase54 ± 5cp < 0.003 versus PMA + SOD. + 0.05 mm PMA + 66 μg/ml SOD + 1.0 mm NaN397 ± 9 + 0.05 mm PMA + 66 μg/ml SOD + 0.1 mm NADH20 ± 2cp < 0.003 versus PMA + SOD.a p < 0.001 versus neutrophils.b p < 0.003 versus PMA.c p < 0.003 versus PMA + SOD. Open table in a new tab To more directly demonstrate a catalytic role for MPO in IQ nitrosation by PMNs, two unrelated patients with MPO-deficient PMNs were evaluated. Normal PMNs incubated with 0.01 mm IQ and 1.2 μm NO/min for 36 min produced 26 ± 3 pmol of N-NO-IQ. In maximally stimulated neutrophils, PMA + SOD produced significantly more N-NO-IQ, 42 ± 3 pmol (p < 0.01). This increase in N-NO-IQ formation was completely inhibited by catalase. As demonstrated in Fig. 7 (bottom), the N-NO-IQ HPLC peak was converted to 2-N3-IQ by incubation of PMN-derived material under acidic conditions with 10 mm NaN3. In the MPO-deficient PMNs, N-NO-IQ production observed for one patient was 27 ± 1 and 26 ± 2 pmol for neutrophils and neutrophils with PMA + SOD, respectively. For the second patient, N-NO-IQ production was 26 ± 2 and 30 ± 2 pmol for neutrophils and neutrophils with PMA + SOD, respectively. The oxidant bursts observed with PMNs from the normal control and MPO-deficient patients were similar. The inability of MPO-deficient PMNs to increase N-NO-IQ forma"
https://openalex.org/W1974368689,"In the last decade, the notion that microtubules are critical to the spatial organization of signal transduction and contribute to the transmission of signals to downstream targets has been proposed. Because the STAT5B transduction and transcription factor is the major STAT protein activated by growth hormone stimulation in hepatocytes and is a crossroads between many signaling pathways, we studied the involvement of microtubules in STAT5B-mediated growth hormone signaling pathway in the highly differentiated and polarized WIF-B hepatic cell line. We showed that depolymerization of the microtubule network impaired STAT5B translocation to the nucleus upon growth hormone treatment. A significant amount of STAT5B binds to microtubules, while STAT5A and STAT3 are exclusively compartmentalized in the cytosol. Moreover, taxol-induced stabilization of microtubules released STAT5B from its binding, and we show that STAT5B binds specifically to the highly dynamic microtubules and is absent of the stable microtubule subpopulation. The specific involvement of dynamic microtubule subpopulation in growth hormone signaling pathway was confirmed by the inhibition of growth hormone-induced STAT5B nuclear translocation after stabilization of microtubules or specific disruption of highly dynamic microtubules. Upon growth hormone treatment, MT-bound STAT5B was rapidly released from microtubules by a dynein-dependent transport to the nucleus. Altogether, our findings indicate that the labile microtubule subpopulation specifically and dynamically organizes STAT5B-mediated growth hormone signaling in hepatic cells.

Once bound to specific receptors, a large number of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones act through a sequence of steps allowing the rapid transport of information from the plasma membrane to subcellular targets. This information often results in the phosphorylation of transcription factors that subsequently migrate to the nucleus where they initiate specific gene transcription. How transcription factors are organized as molecular targets downstream of receptor activation and how they move rapidly through the cytoplasm from their activation site to the nucleus often remains unclear. The notion that microtubules (MTs) 1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GH, growth hormone; GR, glucocorticoid receptor. might be involved in the cytoplasmic activation and/or trafficking of various transcription factors and protein kinases has emerged, as many signal transduction molecules, including transcription factors and protein kinases, have been shown to interact with MTs (1Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). For example, the glucocorticoid receptor was shown to colocalize with the MT network in mammalian cells (2Akner G. Mossberg K. Wikstrom A.C. Sundqvist K.G. Gustafsson J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 39: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Akner G. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor protein p53 also uses MT tracks to migrate to the nucleus (4Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Ward Y. Webster K.R. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Various protein kinases such as the MAP kinase kinase kinase MLK2 (5Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) or the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (6Morishima-Kawashima M. Kosik K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were also shown to interact or to colocalize with MTs or with microtubule-associated proteins (7Lim R.W. Halpain S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20578-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the putative involvement of the MT network in GH signaling in the highly differentiated WIF-B hepatic cell line (8Cassio D. Hamon-Benais C. Guerin M. Lecoq O. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1397-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Shanks M.R. Cassio D. Lecoq O. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 813-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After ligand binding, the activated GH receptor activates the JAK2 tyrosine kinase, which in turn may phosphorylate three proteins from the STAT family: STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. This tyrosine phosphorylation is followed by STAT homo- and/or heterodimerization and translocation to the nucleus where the activated dimers bind to the γ-interferon-activated sequence in the promoter of target genes. In hepatocytes, STAT5B is the major STAT protein activated in response to a physiological pulse of GH (10Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In addition to the classic JAK-STAT pathway, GH binding to its receptor may also result in the JAK2-dependent activation of ERK/MAPK serine-threonine kinases (11Winston L.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30837-30840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), to modulate the activity of STAT5 isoforms (12Dinerstein-Cali H. Ferrag F. Kayser C. Kelly P.A. Postel-Vinay M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 166: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The involvement of MTs in GH signaling is suggested as GH treatment was proposed to stabilize the MT network (13Goh E.L. Pircher T.J. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4364-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and to activate the MT-bound MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2, which may also phosphorylate STAT5 on serine residues (14Reszka A.A. Seger R. Diltz C.D. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8881-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 15Pircher T.J. Petersen H. Gustafsson J.A. Haldosen L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 555-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That MTs might be involved in organizing STAT-mediated signaling pathways remains controversial however. Indeed, EGF-induced STAT1 nuclear translocation was found to be inhibited upon MT depolymerization by colchicine (16Vasilenko K.P. Burova E.B. Tsupkina N.V. Nikol'skii N.N. Tsitologiia. 1998; 40: 1063-1069PubMed Google Scholar) while interferon α- and γ-induced STAT1 translocation appeared not to depend on MTs (17Lillemeier B.F. Koster M. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2508-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine the possibility that MTs might be involved in the organization of STAT5B-mediated transduction in response to GH treatment in hepatic cells. Furthermore, as pointed out by the differential effects of TGF-β or lysophosphatidic acid signaling on MT subsets (18Gundersen G.G. Kim I. Chapin C.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 645-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cook T.A. Nagasaki T. Gundersen G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), MT subpopulations might not be involved to the same extent in cell signaling. In eukaryotic cells, the differentiation of the MT network into subpopulations mainly results from the selective stabilization of some MTs, which can be identified by their higher resistance to dilution- or nocodazole-induced depolymerization and which exhibit high concentrations of post-translationally modified tubulin (for review, see Ref. 20MacRae T.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). As it seems likely that these highly dynamic and stable MT subpopulations differ in their molecular environment, we also examined the possibility that a specific MT subpopulation might be involved in the cytoplasmic organization of STAT5B-mediated signaling pathway. Antibodies and Chemicals—Anti-STAT5B, directed against the C-terminal part of the molecule (C-17), anti-STAT5A (L-20), and anti-STAT3 (K-15) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. The specificity of the anti-STAT5B and anti-STAT5A antibodies was verified in all the cell lines studied. Anti-α-tubulin (clone DM1-A), anti-acetyltubulin (clone 6–11B1), anti-rabbit IgG FITC conjugates, anti-mouse TRITC conjugates, anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugates were purchased from Sigma. Anti-GM130 mouse antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-PCNA antibodies were from Caltag laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Paclitaxel (Taxol®) and nocodazole were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Treatments—WIF-B cells were cultured in F12 Coon's modified medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Eurobio, les Ulis, France) and HAT mixture (10–5m hypoxanthine, 4 × 10–7m aminopterine, and 1.5 × 10–4m thymidine; Polylabo, Strasbourg, France). Cells were cultured in serum-free medium 24 h before induction with 50 nm human GH (Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). MDCK, HuH7, and MDA-MB 231 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Nocodazole and taxol were diluted in culture medium before use, starting from 10 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. 201-F, a magnesium salt of ilimaquinone (21Kondracki M.L. Guyot M.

The working concentrations were 10 μm for nocodazole, 20 μm for taxol, and 25 μm for 201-F. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—After treatment with GH for indicated times, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, then scraped into homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20 mm KCl, 30% sucrose, pH 7.9). After centrifugation (800 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 30% sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease- and phosphatase-inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 μm leupeptin, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride) and incubated on ice for 1 min. After centrifugation (4,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), the nuclear pellet was rinsed twice with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20 mm KCl, 15% sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9), then resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9) supplemented with the above-described inhibitor mixture, and incubated on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation (25,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min), the supernatant was used as nuclear extract. Nuclear extract protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). MT Purification—Cells were washed twice with PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9), and soluble proteins were extracted in the same buffer supplemented with 0.05% Triton X-100 and the antiprotease and antiphosphatase mixture. Soluble protein extraction was followed by one rinse in Triton-free buffer. We verified that, in such conditions, cellular MTs were preserved at the morphological level by immunofluorescence labeling of α-tubulin. 2A. Drechou and T. Phung-Koskas, personal unpublished results. MTs were then depolymerized by the combined action of calcium (5 mm CaCl2) and cold (4 °C, 1 h) in PM buffer (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and the antiprotease and antiphosphatase mixture. The efficiency of MTs depolymerization was checked at the morphological level. 2A. Drechou and T. Phung-Koskas, personal unpublished results. Soluble and microtubular fractions were concentrated and dialyzed against PEM in Centricon 10 filtration devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), then cleared by centrifugation (25,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). MTs were repolymerized for 45 min at 37 °C by addition of 20 μm taxol and 1 mm GTP. MTs were then pelleted by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 37 °C and washed once with PEM buffer supplemented with 1 mm GTP. MTs were then directly depolymerized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer while soluble proteins were supplemented with 4× concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Purification of Stable and Dynamic MTs—Cells were washed twice with PEM buffer, and soluble proteins were extracted in the same buffer supplemented with 0.05% Triton X-100 and the antiprotease and antiphosphatase mixture. Soluble protein extraction was followed by one rinse in Triton-free buffer. Incubation of extracted cells in PEM buffer during 30 min at 37 °C allowed the dilution-induced depolymerization of the most labile MTs. To be sure that no dynamic MT remained in extracted cells, cells were further incubated for a prolonged period of time with PEM (3 h at 37 °C). Stable MTs that remained in permeabilized cells were subsequently depolymerized by the combined action of calcium (5 mm CaCl2) and cold (4 °C, 1 h) in PM buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and the antiprotease and antiphosphatase mixture. The solutions containing MT proteins were dialyzed against PEM and concentrated using Centricon 10 filtration devices, then centrifuged (25,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). MTs were then repolymerized by addition of 20 μm taxol and 1 mm GTP (45 min, 37 °C) and centrifuged (25,000 × g, 30 min, 37 °C). MT pellets were rinsed once with polymerization buffer supplemented with 1 mm GTP. Dynamic and stable MTs were then directly depolymerized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subsequently analyzed by Western blot. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 9% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were probed with anti-α-tubulin or anti-acetyl-tubulin monoclonal antibody, anti-STAT5B, anti-STAT5A, or anti-STAT3 polyclonal antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected using goat antimouse or goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA) on Kodak Biomax MR films. Band intensities were quantified by densitometry. Immunofluorescence—After appropriate treatment, WIF-B cells cultured on glass coverslips were rinsed twice with PEM buffer and permeabilized with the same buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (37 °C, 3 min). After two rinses with Triton-free buffer and two rinses with PBS, cells were fixed with cold methanol (5 min, –20 °C). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS, and incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with FITC-conjugated or with a mixture of FITC- and TRITC-conjugated antibodies for single or double labeling experiments, respectively. After three washes with PBS, the coverslips were examined by epifluorescence using a Leica DMLB microscope with a ×100 objective or by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—Full-length STAT5B inserted in Myc-tagged pUHD vector (generous gift from M. Pallardy, INSERM U461, Chātenay-Malabry, France) was introduced into pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech, PaloAlto, CA) on SmaI and SstII sites. STAT5B deletion mutants were generated by mutagenesis using the QuikChangeTM Site mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce a stop codon in position 779 (Gln779). Mutations were confirmed by direct sequence analysis. For Cter-STAT5B mutant (Cter), the sequence encoding the C-terminal tail of STAT5B (115 amino acids) was amplified by PCR using primers designed also to introduce a SstII site upstream of the PCR product. The final PCR product was digested with SstII and XbaI and purified before ligation into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Transient Transfections—HuH7 cells grown on glass coverslips in 6-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of DNA using 3 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol and used 24 h after transfection. WIF-B cells were resuspended in PBS (1.2 × 106 cells/400 μl), incubated with 30 μg of p50/dynamitin plasmid kindly provided by S. Etienne-Manneville (Medical Research Council for Molecular Cell Biology and Cell Biology Unit, University College London, UK, Ref. 23Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) and electroporated at 300 V and 250 μfarad using the Genepulser System (Bio-Rad). Cells were then diluted with 1 ml of culture medium, transferred on glass coverslips in 6-well plates, and used 24 h after transfection. MT Depolymerization Impairs GH-induced Nuclear Translocation of STAT5B but Not That of STAT3—To determine whether MTs are actually involved in the STAT5B-mediated GH signaling pathway in hepatic cells, we performed experiments in which the MT network of WIF-B cells was depolymerized by a 4-h nocodazole treatment prior to GH induction. We have previously shown that, in these conditions, the MT network is fully depolymerized in WIF-B cells (22Poüs C. Chabin K. Drechou A. Barbot L. Phung-Koskas T. Settegrana C. Bourguet-Kondracki M.L. Maurice M. Cassio D. Guyot M. Durand G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At increasing times after GH treatment, nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blot for the presence of STAT5B or STAT3 (Fig. 1A). PCNA, a resident nuclear protein, was revealed as loading control. Consistent with previous studies (24Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), GH treatment induced a rapid translocation of STAT5B into the nucleus, the maximum effect being reached after 5 min. By contrast, when the whole MT network was disrupted by nocodazole treatment, STAT5B translocation was dramatically slowed down and was about 2-fold less effective than that measured in control cells (Fig. 1A) whereas the overall (nuclear + cytoplasmic) STAT5B level was unaffected (Fig. 1B, lane 0). Comparatively, GH-induced nuclear translocation of STAT3 was not affected in the absence of MTs, for up to 45 min (Fig. 1A). The latter result suggests that, in the GH signaling pathway, the events which occur upstream of STAT activation do not depend on the integrity of the MT network. This also means that MTs would play a role in the latest cytoplasmic steps of GH signaling, i.e. STAT5B activation and/or nuclear translocation. As expected by STAT5B phosphorylation on a tyrosine residue by the JAK2 kinase after GH stimulation (25Gouilleux F. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Wakao H. Haldosen L.A. Norstedt G. Levy D. Groner B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 26Silva C.M. Lu H. Day R.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a double band of STAT5B was early observed in the Western blot analysis of total cell lysates (Fig. 1B). The kinetics of STAT5B phosphorylation upon GH treatment was not impaired after MT depolymerization (Fig. 1B), indicating that the impairment of nuclear translocation we observed (Fig. 1A) did not result from an altered activation of STAT5B but from a downstream inhibition involving MTs. These biochemical results were confirmed in immunofluorescence experiments in which cells were double-stained with antibodies to STAT5B and α-tubulin. After a 5-min GH treatment of WIF-B cells, STAT5B was mainly translocated in the nucleus. When cells were pretreated with nocodazole for 1 h to depolymerize most of the MT network (Fig. 1C, lower panel), nuclear translocation of STAT5B dramatically decreased compared with controls (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Altogether, these results clearly indicate that nuclear translocation of STAT5B induced by GH treatment depends upon the integrity of the MT network. STAT5B Specifically Binds to MTs Compared with STAT5A or STAT3—To test whether STAT5B actually interacts with MTs, we analyzed separately cytosolic and MT fractions purified from WIF-B cells by Western blot. A significant fraction (25%) of cellular STAT5B co-purified with the MT fraction (Fig. 2A). No STAT5B was pelleted in the absence of MTs i.e. when this fraction was purified from cells in which the MT network was fully depolymerized by a 4 h nocodazole treatment (results not shown). To make sure that this interaction was not restricted to WIF-B cells, we further checked that STAT5B was present in the MT fractions obtained from other cell lines. Fig. 2A shows that a significant proportion of STAT5B interacts with MTs in all cell types we analyzed (MDCK, HuH7, and MDA-MB 231 cells). Compared with STAT5B, STAT3 and STAT5A were found exclusively in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2B) as suggested by others (15Pircher T.J. Petersen H. Gustafsson J.A. Haldosen L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 555-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), clearly indicating that STAT5B specifically associates with MTs. Interestingly, STAT5A and STAT5B are highly homologous and differ mainly by a short C-terminal tail (27Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), suggesting that this region could be directly involved in the differential binding of the two proteins on MTs. To evaluate the putative role of STAT5B C-terminal domain in MT binding, we performed transfection experiments in HuH7 hepatoma cells with a plasmid encoding GFP-tagged wild-type STAT5B or GFP-tagged STAT5B with deletion of its last 8 amino acids (Q779). As shown in Fig. 2C, wild-type construction bound to MTs in the same proportion than endogenous STAT5B (MT fraction versus cytosolic fraction). Moreover, C-terminally truncated STAT5B (Q779) still bound to MTs to the same extent as the wild-type construction, suggesting that this part of the molecule is not directly involved in MT binding. This result was confirmed by transfecting HuH7 cells with a plasmid encoding the C-terminal tail of STAT5B (115 amino acids), which appeared to localize strictly in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2D). To confirm STAT5B-MT interaction, we performed double immunofluorescence labeling of α-tubulin and STAT5B in WIF-B cells, which were first permeabilized in PEM buffer to extract soluble cytosolic proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, STAT5B colocalized and/or was closely juxtaposed to MTs. Interestingly, STAT5B staining was not uniform along MTs, but occurred in discrete locations, suggesting that it might be compartmentalized into specific MT sites. STAT5B Specifically Interacts with Highly Dynamic MTs— Dynamic and stable MT subpopulations might not be involved to the same extent in cell signaling, and alteration of their dynamic properties may play a role in modulating the activation or the nuclear translocation of MT-bound signaling effectors. To test whether an alteration of MT dynamics could modulate STAT5B binding to MTs, we quantified its interaction with MTs in cells previously treated with taxol (20 μm, 2 h) to stabilize MTs. As shown in Fig. 4A, there was a dramatic (about 15-fold) drop in STAT5B amount in taxol-stabilized MTs compared with controls, suggesting that MT dynamics is a crucial parameter for STAT5B binding. To further explore the binding of STAT5B as a function of MT dynamics, we devised a protocol to separate and purify highly dynamic and stable MTs. This protocol is based on the previous observation that after cell extraction in PEM buffer, the whole MT network is preserved only for a brief period of time. Highly dynamic MTs indeed depolymerize very slowly in these conditions (within 30–45 min approximately), whereas stable MTs are not affected (28Infante A.S. Stein M.S. Zhai Y. Borisy G.G. Gundersen G.G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3907-3919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We validated the purification by following the loss of total α-tubulin and of acetylated tubulin, the latter being the only post-translationally modified tubulin to accumulate in the stable MTs of WIF-B cells (22Poüs C. Chabin K. Drechou A. Barbot L. Phung-Koskas T. Settegrana C. Bourguet-Kondracki M.L. Maurice M. Cassio D. Guyot M. Durand G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, shortly after soluble protein extraction, the overall MT network was preserved (panels a and b). After a 30-min incubation in PEM buffer, the density of the α-tubulin network began to drop (Fig. 4B, c and d). The fraction that depolymerized during this period was expected to contain only molecules that composed or were associated with dynamic MTs. A more prolonged (3 h) incubation in PEM led to the complete depolymerization of residual, non-acetylated MTs (Fig. 4B, panels e and f). Stable MTs were then depolymerized by the combined action of calcium and cold (Fig. 4B, panels g and h). The dynamic and stable MT fractions that were obtained in this experiment were analyzed for the presence of α-tubulin, acetylated-tubulin, and STAT5B (Fig. 4C). As expected, α-tubulin was present in both fractions and acetylatedtubulin was detected only in the stable MT fraction, confirming the absence of contamination of the dynamic fraction by stable MTs. Strikingly, STAT5B was detected very specifically in the dynamic MT fraction (there was no signal in the stable MT fraction) (Fig. 4C). Together with the results from taxol experiments, these data clearly indicate that MT-bound STAT5B is specifically enriched and compartmentalized in the dynamic MT subpopulation. Stabilization of MTs or Selective Disruption of Dynamic MTs Impairs STAT5B Nuclear Translocation after GH Treatment—To further explore the functional specialization of dynamic and stable MTs in the GH signaling pathway, we performed experiments in which MTs were stabilized by treatment of WIF-B cells with taxol (20 μm, 2 h) prior to GH stimulation. In these conditions, the effectiveness of STAT5B nuclear translocation was decreased (Fig. 5A) indicating that the inhibition of MT dynamics impaired STAT5B targeting to the nucleus. We also performed experiments in which highly dynamic MTs were specifically depolymerized using the 201-F compound. We have previously shown that 201-F compound selectively disassembles dynamic MTs without affecting stable MTs in WIF-B cells (22Poüs C. Chabin K. Drechou A. Barbot L. Phung-Koskas T. Settegrana C. Bourguet-Kondracki M.L. Maurice M. Cassio D. Guyot M. Durand G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As expected, in the presence of a normal MT network, GH treatment induced STAT5B and STAT5A translocation into the nucleus. In cells treated with 201-F, in which only the stable MT subset was preserved, STAT5B remained in the cytoplasm after GH induction, indicating that the dynamic MT subpopulation is required for STAT5B transport to the nucleus (Fig. 5B). As expected from our previous finding that STAT5A is only cytosolic, the GH-induced nuclear transport of STAT5A was not impaired in the absence of dynamic MTs (Fig. 5B). Altogether, these observations indicate that unaltered dynamic MTs are essential for the transport of STAT5B to the nucleus after GH stimulation. MT-bound STAT5B Is Activated upon GH Stimulation—We further addressed the functional significance of STAT5B-MT binding by analyzing STAT5B-MT interaction upon GH stimulation. Western blot analyses were performed on cytosolic and MT fractions purified from control and GH-treated cells (Fig. 6). As expected from the fact that STAT5B is phosphorylated upon GH stimulation, we observed the occurrence of a double band as soon as 2.5 min after GH treatment in the cytosolic fraction. This activation was paralleled by the occurrence of a similar double band in the MT fraction suggesting that the fraction of STAT5B bound to MTs actively participates in the GH transduction pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2003949217,"We have reported that the combined expression of Pdx-1 (pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1) and Isl-1 (islet 1) enables immature rat enterocytes (IEC-6) to produce and release insulin. A key component regulating the release of insulin is the ATP-sensitive potassium channel subunit Kir6.2. To investigate the regulation of Kir6.2 gene expression, we assessed Kir6.2 expression in IEC-6 cells expressing Pdx-1 and/or Isl-1. We observed that Kir6.2 protein was expressed de novo in IEC-6 cells expressing both Pdx-1 and Isl-1 but not in cells expressing Pdx-1 alone. Next, we analyzed the regions of the Kir6.2 promoter (–1677/–45) by performing a luciferase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The results have demonstrated that Kir6.2 promoter possesses two regions regulating the promoter activity: a Foxa2-binding site (–1364 to –1210) and an Sp1/Sp3-binding site (–1035 to –939). The additional expression of Isl-1 in IEC-6 cells expressing Pdx-1 attenuated overexpression of Foxa2 protein and enhanced Kir6.2 expression. Finally, knockdown of Isl-1 using the iRNA technique resulted in decreased expression of Kir6.2 protein in a rat pancreatic β-cell line (RIN-5F cells). These results indicate that expression of Kir6.2 in the rat intestine is moderated by Isl-1."
