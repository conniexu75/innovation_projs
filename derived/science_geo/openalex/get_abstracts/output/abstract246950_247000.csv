https://openalex.org/W1545465591,"Traditional weather forecasting has been built on a foundation of deterministic modeling--start with initial conditions, put them into a supercomputer model, and end up with a prediction about future weather. But as Gneiting and Raftery discuss in their Perspective, a new approach--ensemble forecasting--was introduced in the early 1990s. In this method, up to 100 different computer runs, each with slightly different starting conditions or model assumptions, are combined into a weather forecast. In concert with statistical techniques, ensembles can provide accurate statements about the uncertainty in daily and seasonal forecasting. The challenge now is to improve the modeling, statistical analysis, and visualization technologies for disseminating the ensemble results."

Here we describe a microwave diode that uses a cold-cathode electron source consisting of carbon nanotubes and that operates at high frequency and at high current densities. Because it weighs little, responds instantaneously and has no need of heating, this miniaturized electron source should prove valuable for microwave devices used in telecommunications."

https://openalex.org/W2077954885,"Continuous hydroxylation of the HIF-1 transcription factor α subunit by oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases promotes decay of this protein and thus prevents the transcriptional activation of many genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis, cell survival, and matrix modification. Hypoxia blocks HIF-1α hydroxylation and thus activates HIF-1α-mediated gene expression. Several nonhypoxic stimuli can also activate HIF-1, although the mechanisms involved are not well known. Here we show that the glucose metabolites pyruvate and oxaloacetate inactivate HIF-1α decay in a manner selectively reversible by ascorbate, cysteine, histidine, and ferrous iron but not by 2-oxoglutarate or oxygen. Pyruvate and oxaloacetate bind to the 2-oxoglutarate site of HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylases, but their effects on HIF-1 are not mimicked by other Krebs cycle intermediates, including succinate and fumarate. We show that inactivation of HIF-1 hydroxylation by glucose-derived 2-oxoacids underlies the prominent basal HIF-1 activity commonly seen in many highly glycolytic cancer cells. Since HIF-1 itself promotes glycolytic metabolism, enhancement of HIF-1 by glucose metabolites may constitute a novel feed-forward signaling mechanism involved in malignant progression."

Virulence gene expression in vivo represents a target for antibiotic discovery that has not yet been explored. A high-throughput, phenotypic screen was used to identify a small molecule 4-[ N -(1,8-naphthalimide)]- n -butyric acid, virstatin, that inhibits virulence regulation in Vibrio cholerae . By inhibiting the transcriptional regulator ToxT, virstatin prevents expression of two critical V. cholerae virulence factors, cholera toxin and the toxin coregulated pilus. Orogastric administration of virstatin protects infant mice from intestinal colonization by V. cholerae ."
https://openalex.org/W2010533815,"Changes in plasticity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain are associated with addiction to cocaine and other drugs of abuse. A study in mice suggests that the VTA may also be involved in forming drug-associated memory. Repeated doses of cocaine facilitated long-term potentiation in dopamine neurons, a phenomenon seen as a form of memory in which interlinked neurons acting together become more strongly connected. Cocaine seems to act by reducing GABA-mediated neuronal inhibition. These changes may explain the action of the antiepileptic drug γ-vinyl-GABA (vigabatrin), now in clinical trials for the treatment of cocaine addiction. Drugs of abuse are known to cause persistent modification of neural circuits, leading to addictive behaviours1,2,3,4,5. Changes in synaptic plasticity in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) may contribute to circuit modification induced by many drugs of abuse, including cocaine6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Here we report that, following repeated exposure to cocaine in vivo, excitatory synapses to rat VTA dopamine neurons become highly susceptible to the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity. This facilitated LTP induction is caused by cocaine-induced reduction of GABAA (γ-aminobutyric acid) receptor-mediated inhibition of these dopamine neurons. In midbrain slices from rats treated with saline or a single dose of cocaine, LTP could not be induced in VTA dopamine neurons unless GABA-mediated inhibition was reduced by bicuculline or picrotoxin. However, LTP became readily inducible in slices from rats treated repeatedly with cocaine; this LTP induction was prevented by enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition using diazepam. Furthermore, repeated cocaine exposure reduced the amplitude of GABA-mediated synaptic currents and increased the probability of spike initiation in VTA dopamine neurons. This cocaine-induced enhancement of synaptic plasticity in the VTA may be important for the formation of drug-associated memory."

https://openalex.org/W1982398731,"Stochastic resonance is a counterintuitive concept: the addition of noise to a noisy system induces coherent amplification of its response. First suggested as a mechanism for the cyclic recurrence of ice ages, stochastic resonance has been seen in a wide variety of macroscopic physical systems: bistable ring lasers, superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), magnetoelastic ribbons and neurophysiological systems such as the receptors in crickets and crayfish. Although fundamentally important as a mechanism of coherent signal amplification, stochastic resonance has yet to be observed in nanoscale systems. Here we report the observation of stochastic resonance in bistable nanomechanical silicon oscillators. Our nanomechanical systems consist of beams that are clamped at each end and driven into transverse oscillation with the use of a radiofrequency source. Modulation of the source induces controllable switching of the beams between two stable, distinct states. We observe that the addition of white noise causes a marked amplification of the signal strength. Stochastic resonance in nanomechanical systems could have a function in the realization of controllable high-speed nanomechanical memory cells, and paves the way for exploring macroscopic quantum coherence and tunnelling."
https://openalex.org/W2026923069,"We present a theory of the metal-insulator transition in a disordered two-dimensional electron gas. A quantum critical point, separating the metallic phase, which is stabilized by electronic interactions, from the insulating phase, where disorder prevails over the electronic interactions, has been identified. The existence of the quantum critical point leads to a divergence in the density of states of the underlying collective modes at the transition, causing the thermodynamic properties to behave critically as the transition is approached. We show that the interplay of electron-electron interactions and disorder can explain the observed transport properties and the anomalous enhancement of the spin susceptibility near the metal-insulator transition."

https://openalex.org/W1977851507,"Human histone demethylase LSD1 is a flavin-dependent amine oxidase that catalyzes the specific removal of methyl groups from mono- and dimethylated Lys4 of histone H3. The N-terminal tail of H3 is subject to various covalent modifications, and a fundamental question in LSD1 biology is how these epigenetic marks affect the demethylase activity. We show that LSD1 does not have a strong preference for mono- or dimethylated Lys4 of H3. Substrate recognition is not confined to the residues neighboring Lys4, but it requires a sufficiently long peptide segment consisting of the N-terminal 20 amino acids of H3. Electrostatic interactions are an important factor in protein-substrate recognition, as indicated by the high sensitivity of Km to ionic strength. We have probed LSD1 for its ability to demethylate Lys4 in presence of a second modification on the same peptide substrate. Methylation of Lys9 does not affect enzyme catalysis. Conversely, Lys9 acetylation causes an almost 6-fold increase in the Km value, whereas phosphorylation of Ser10 totally abolishes activity. LSD1 is inhibited by a demethylated peptide with an inhibition constant of 1.8 μm, suggesting that LSD1 can bind to H3 independently of Lys4 methylation. LSD1 is a chromatin-modifying enzyme, which is able to read different epigenetic marks on the histone N-terminal tail and can serve as a docking module for the stabilization of the associated corepressor complex(es) on chromatin.

Histones play a fundamental role in the control of a variety of cellular processes, including gene expression, DNA replication, and repair. Histone function is modulated through covalent modifications by acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation (1Biel M. Wascholowski V. Giannis A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 3186-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 2Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). These modifications have specific effects and act in a combinatorial manner defining the so-called histone code (1Biel M. Wascholowski V. Giannis A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 3186-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 3Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar). Very recently, Shi et al. (4Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar) and our group (5Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) have reported on the discovery of the first enzyme able to specifically demethylate Lys4 of histone H3. The protein was therefore named LSD1 (for lysine-specific demethylase; it is also known as KIAA0601 and BHC110). The existence of histone-demethylating enzymes has always been questioned (6Sims R.J. Nishioka K. Reinberg D. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 7Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2005; 436: 1103-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and with the discovery of LSD1, it was firmly established that histone methylation is a dynamic process under enzymatic control similar to the other known post-translational histone modifications. LSD1 has been typically found in association with CoREST and HDAC1/2 proteins, forming a module found in several multiprotein co-repressor complexes (8Humphrey G.W. Wang Y. Russanova V.R. Hirai T.

Cell. 2005; 19: 857-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Knock-out of LSD1 by RNA interference was shown to cause increased levels of histone methylation, resulting in the reactivation of a specific target gene (4Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that LSD1 is a bona fide co-repressor able to repress a reporter gene and that this function is dependent on the demethylase activity (4Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology analysis, it was predicted that several histone demethylases are likely to exist in mammalian and other eukaryotic organisms (4Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). From a biochemical and structural standpoint, LSD1 belongs to the class of flavin-dependent amine oxidases, which typically catalyze the oxidation of an amine-containing substrate using molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor (5Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 12Binda C. Mattevi A. Edmondson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23973-23976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Indeed, LSD1 catalyzes the demethylase reaction through an oxidative process (5Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). The amino group of the methylated Lys is oxidized presumably to generate the corresponding imine compound, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to produce formaldehyde. Substrate oxidation leads to the two-electron reduction of the protein-bound FAD cofactor, which is regenerated to its oxidized form by molecular oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide. LSD1 catalyzes the specific removal of methyl groups from mono- and dimethylated Lys4 of histone H3 (H3-K4) 5The abbreviations used are: H3-K4Lys4 of histone 3H3histone 3Δ184human LSD1 mutant harboring a deletion of the N-terminal 184 amino acidsMes2-(N-morpholinoethanesulfonic acidTaps3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid.

Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), although an androgen receptor-controlled activity on H3-K9 has also been reported (13Metzger E. Wissmann M. Yin N. Muller J.M. Schneider R. Peters A.H. Gunther T. Buettner R. Schule R. Nature. 2005; 437: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). The histone H3 N-terminal tail is a region characterized by extreme density of covalent modifications with diverse biological meanings (reviewed in Refs. 1Biel M. Wascholowski V. Giannis A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 3186-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 2Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, and 6Sims R.J. Nishioka K. Reinberg D. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Among them, of special significance are positions Lys4, Lys9, and Ser10, which are the most extensively and widely studied epigenetic marks of H3. Methylation of Lys4 is generally known to activate transcription, and, therefore, the demethylase activity of LSD1 removes an activation mark. Lys9 can be either acetylated or methylated, resulting in opposite effects; acetylation promotes formation of euchromatin, whereas methylation leads to repression of transcription. Phosphorylation of Ser10 is a pivotal activating signal and prevents the recruitment of the transcriptional repressors by methylated Lys9. A key problem is now to define the biological properties of LSD1, especially in relation to its ability to “read and interpret” these epigenetic marks on H3. We addressed this problem through an in vitro study that probed human LSD1 (Fig. 2a) for its ability to act on histone peptides bearing different covalent modifications.

Protein Purification—Escherichia coli cells overproducing a truncated form of LSD1 lacking the N-terminal 184 amino acids (Δ184) were grown as described (5Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was purified following the protocol of Forneris et al. (5Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), modified by omitting the cation exchange chromatography step. The purity of the protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2a) and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The recombinant protein carries an N-terminal His6 tag to facilitate purification. Control experiments have shown that removal of the His6 tag by proteolysis (using TEV protease) did not alter the enzyme activity by more than 5%. Protein aliquots were stored in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 50% (w/v) glycerol at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were routinely measured by absorption spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of 10,790 m-1 cm-1 at 458 nm, which was determined based on absorbance changes observed after protein denaturation in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, plus 0.3% (w/v) SDS (14Aliverti A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 131: 9-23PubMed Google Scholar). Activity Assays—Peptides were purchased from Thermo Electron Corp. Their purity was greater than 90% as checked by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Initial velocity measurements were performed using a peroxidase-coupled assay, which monitors hydrogen peroxide production (5Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The time courses of the reaction were measured under aerobic conditions by using a Cary 100 UV-visible spectro-photometer equipped with thermostated cell holder (T = 25 °C). Reactions were started by adding 2 μl of protein solution (40 μm protein in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 5% (w/v) glycerol) to reaction mixtures (150 μl) consisting of 50 mm Hepes/NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm 4-aminoantipyrine, 1 mm 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid, 0.35 μm horseradish peroxidase, and variable concentrations (2-100 μm) of methylated H3-K4 peptide. Absorbance changes were monitored at 515 nm, and an extinction coefficient of 26,000 m-1 cm-1 was used to calculate the initial velocity values. After visual inspection of double reciprocal plots, which were linear, the initial velocity values, expressed as apparent turnover values, were directly fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 2b) using Grafit (Erithacus Software), which provides the values of apparent kcat and Km along with their associated errors. Effect of Ionic Strength and pH on LSD1 Activity—To evaluate the effects of ionic strength on LSD1 activity, assays were performed by using increasing amounts of NaCl and KCl in the reaction mixture, starting from 1 mm up to 500 mm. In the determination of the pH dependence of steady-state parameters, the pH range was covered using Mes/NaOH (pH 6.5-7.0), Hepes/NaOH (7.0-8.0), Taps/NaOH (8.0-9.0) buffers at a final concentration of 50 mm. The ionic strength was kept constant at 48 mm by the addition of an appropriate amount of NaCl (up to 32 mm). We checked that the extinction coefficient of the chromophore generated by the reaction did not change as a function of pH. The kcat and kcat/Km data were best fit to the following equation, which assumes that a given parameter (P) decreases at low and high pH to a 0 value as groups with pKa1 and pKa2 dissociate (15Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. 1975; (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York)Google Scholar): log P = log Pmax - log(1 + 10(pKa1 - pH) + 10(pKa1 + pKa2 - 2pH)). Inhibition Studies—LSD1 inhibitors were tested by using the peroxidase-coupled assay in the presence of varied concentrations (2-100 μm) of methylated H3-K4 peptides and of the inhibitor under analysis (global range 1-300 μm, depending on the inhibitor strength). Initial velocity values were fit to equations describing competitive, uncompetitive, and noncompetitive inhibition patterns using Grafit. In all cases, the best fit was obtained with the equation describing a competitive inhibition, which allowed us to apply in some instances the Dixon plot for a graphical estimate of the Ki values. We have attempted to measure peptide binding affinities also by isothermal titration microcalorimetry; however, we found that upon the addition of the peptides, the protein solution became transiently turbid, and this feature made the usage of microcalorimetry unfeasible. Activities with Monomethylated and Dimethylated 21-Amino Acid Peptides—Biochemical analyses were performed using a recombinant N-terminally truncated form of human LSD1 (5Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) lacking the first 184 amino acids (we refer to the sequence deposited in the NCBI data base with accession code BAA25527; 886 amino acids). This protein form comprises the SWIRM and polyamine oxidase domains of LSD1 (9Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar); analysis of the amino acid sequence by bioinformatic tools predicts that the 184 truncated amino acids do not fold into an ordered well defined conformation (5Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Furthermore, control experiments (not shown) demonstrated that the catalytic properties of Δ184 are indistinguishable from those of longer variants lacking the first 157 and 34 residues, respectively, the latter being the protein variant used by Shi et al. (4Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). The Δ184 mutant was chosen, because it can be overproduced in E. coli cells and readily purified to a stable and homogeneous form in the amounts required to perform the described experiments (Fig. 2a). LSD1 activity was monitored using histone peptides, which allowed us to quantitatively evaluate the binding and catalytic parameters and the differential effects of various covalent modifications. The first question we addressed in our study was the difference (if any) in the catalytic efficiency toward mono- and dimethylated H3-K4 substrates. We performed steady-state kinetic analysis using peptides consisting of the H3 N-terminal 21 amino acids modified by mono- or di-methylation of Lys4. These were the peptides employed in the early studies that led to the discovery of LSD1 function (4Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar, 5Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency using these two substrates turned out to be very similar (TABLE ONE and Fig. 2b), demonstrating that LSD1 does not exhibit a strong preference for mono-versus dimethylated H3-K4 substrate. An additional value of the steady-state enzymatic parameters measured with the 21-amino acid peptides was that they provided a benchmark to evaluate the activity of LSD1 toward peptides of different lengths or bearing additional covalent modifications (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONESubstrate specificity of human LSD1kcataApparent steady-state kinetic parameters were determined in air-saturated buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, at 25 °C) by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled assay (5)KmaApparent steady-state kinetic parameters were determined in air-saturated buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, at 25 °C) by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled assay (5)kcat/KmaApparent steady-state kinetic parameters were determined in air-saturated buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, at 25 °C) by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled assay (5),bPropagation of statistical error was carried out as described (22)PercentagecThe percentage of activity with reference to that measured with 21aa-[monomethyl]K4min-1μmμm-1 min-1%Peptides of 21 amino acidsdAs a control, the kcat and Km values for 21aa-[dimethyl]K4 and 21aa-[monomethyl]K4 peptides were measured also by means of a ferricenium assay (5), with ferricenium being a nonphysiological monoelectronic acceptor that reacts directly with the reduced LSD1-bound FAD cofactor.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), with ferricenium being a nonphysiological monoelectronic acceptor that reacts directly with the reduced LSD1-bound FAD cofactor. The resulting values were essentially identical to those measured with the peroxidase-coupled assay (not shown)e The assay was performed in 80 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, at 25 °Cf ND, not determined. The activity is absent or barely detectable Open table in a new tab The peptide substrate is rich in charged and titratable groups (the N-terminal amino group; three Arg and four Lys side chains) that in many cases are sites of epigenetic marks (Fig. 1b). We have therefore evaluated the effect of pH and ionic strength on the enzymatic activity. Both apparent kcat and kcat/Km exhibit a bell-shaped pH dependence approaching 0 at low and high pH values (Fig. 3). The kcat/Km value increases as a group with pKa of about 7.2 dissociates and decreases as a group with pKa of about 8.9 becomes deprotonated. kcat shows a similar profile, with pKa values of 7.4 and 9.2, respectively. The similar pKa values observed in the kcat and kcat/Km profiles suggest that they reflect the dissociation state of the same groups and that such groups belong to the enzyme rather than to the peptide substrate (15Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. 1975; (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York)Google Scholar). However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the pKa value of 8.9 observed in the kcat/Km profile actually reflects the dissociation of one of the Arg or Lys residues of the substrate. Despite the fact that the kcat/Km and kcat profiles exhibit maximal values at pH 8.0 and 8.4, respectively, the data reported in this paper refer to assays performed at pH 7.5, which is of physiological significance and close to the optimal pH for activity. A crucial role of ionizable groups is suggested also by the analysis of the effect of the ionic strength on LSD1 catalytic function. The enzyme activity remains essentially constant at NaCl or KCl concentrations up to 50 mm, but it decreases sharply at higher concentrations so that only 10% of residual activity is measured at concentrations greater than 150 mm. The observed decrease of activity is due to a Km increase, as shown by the fact that at 80 mm NaCl, the Km value is 3-fold higher than that found in the absence of added salt, whereas the measured kcat values at 0 and 80 mm NaCl are essentially identical (see TABLE ONE). In this respect, the 4-fold lower specific activity previously reported for LSD1 (5Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) can be ascribed to the ionic strengths of the initial assays, which were carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (ionic strength = 132 mm) as opposed to 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5 (ionic strength = 22 mm). Substrate Recognition and Specificity—To define the actual peptide length recognized by LSD1, we studied the ability of the enzyme to demethylate peptides consisting of the N-terminal 8, 12, 16, and 30 amino acids (Fig. 1b) and modified by monomethylation of Lys4 (TABLE ONE). Both kcat and kcat/Km values for the 30-amino acid substrate were very similar to those measured with the 21-amino acid peptide. Conversely, with the 16-amino acid substrate, the activity became barely detectable, and with shorter peptides no activity could be detected at all. The lack of activity with these “short” peptides was observed also at a pH value of 8.4, which is optimal for catalysis (Fig. 3). The outcome of these experiments indicated that substrate recognition by LSD1 is not confined to the residues neighboring Lys4, but it requires a rather long peptide emphasizing the exquisite substrate specificity of the protein. LSD1 is normally associated to the CoREST protein, which has been shown to enhance LSD1 activity promoting demethylation of the intact nucleosomal particle (11Shi Y.J. Matson C. Lan F. Iwase S. Baba T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 857-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 16Lee M.G. Wynder C. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2005; 437: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). CoREST might exert this effect through stabilization of the interaction with the nucleosomal substrate and/or increase of the accessibility of the N-terminal tail. Enzyme Inhibition—The finding that LSD1 recognizes a long H3 peptide segment suggested the possibility that the reaction product (i.e. the demethylated peptide) could bind to the protein. Experimental verification of this hypothesis revealed that the unmodified 21-amino acid peptide is indeed a competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 1.8 μm (TABLE TWO). Consistent with the substrate specificity studies, a shorter 12-amino acid peptide exhibited a >100-fold reduction in affinity (TABLE TWO). Likewise, deletion of the four N-terminal residues from the 21-amino acid peptide resulted in a 40-fold reduction of the inhibitory power (TABLE TWO). These data imply that methylation of Lys4 is not essential for binding, whereas the affinity is critically dependent on the presence of a sufficiently long segment of the H3 N-terminal tail.TABLE TWOInhibition of human LSD1 by histone H3 peptidesPeptideKiaEnzymatic activities were evaluated in air-saturated buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, at 25 °C) by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled assay using a 21-amino acid peptide monomethylated on Lys4 (5).

In all cases, the inhibition was of the competitive type Open table in a new tab Recently, Metzger et al. (13Metzger E. Wissmann M. Yin N. Muller J.M. Schneider R. Peters A.H. Gunther T. Buettner R. Schule R. Nature. 2005; 437: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar) have reported on an androgen receptor-dependent activity of LSD1. The interaction with the receptor appears to switch the substrate specificity, making LSD1 able to demethylate Lys9 of H3 (isolated LSD1 does not act on Lys9) (4Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar, 5Forneris F. Binda C. Vanoni M.A. Mattevi A. Battaglioli E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2203-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This activity was shown to be inhibited by pargyline, deprenyl, and clorgyline, which are specific inhibitors of human monoamine oxidase A and/or B (17Edmondson D.E. Mattevi A. Binda C. Li M. Hubalek F. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We have tested whether these inhibitors act on LSD1, interfering with its H3-K4 demethylase function. No inhibition was detected, and, in addition, none of these compounds induced the characteristic changes in the absorption spectrum of the protein-bound flavin that are found in inhibited monoamine oxidases (data not shown). Readout of Multiple Epigenetic Marks—The N-terminal tail of H3 is subject to various covalent modifications, and a crucial question in LSD1 biology is how these epigenetic marks affect the demethylase activity. We have probed LSD1 for its ability to demethylate Lys4 in the presence of a second modification on the same 21-amino acid peptide substrate. As shown in TABLE ONE, we tested the effects of methylation and acetylation of Lys9 and phosphorylation of Ser10. Methylation of Lys9 did not affect activity, whereas Lys9 acetylation caused an almost 6-fold increase in the Km value, indicating that this covalent modification significantly affects the substrate binding affinity. Even more dramatic is the effect of Ser10 phosphorylation, which totally suppressed the ability of the peptide to function as substrate. Taken together, these data are consistent with the notion that electrostatic interactions are especially relevant in the enzyme-substrate recognition. Methylation of Lys9, which does not neutralize the Lys positive charge, has no effect on enzymatic reaction. Conversely, neutralization of Lys9 positive charge by acetylation reduces affinity, whereas introduction of the negatively charged phosphate group on Ser10 completely abolishes activity. These findings predict that the Lys9-Ser10 pair binds to a cluster of hydrogen bond acceptors and/or negatively charged groups that enable LSD1 to sense the presence of various covalent modifications on this locus (Fig. 4). A fundamental conclusion gathered from these experiments is that LSD1 is actually capable of reading the histone code in that it discriminates between peptides bearing different covalent modifications on their side chains to the point that a single mark makes the difference between a reactive and a nonreactive peptide. Interestingly, we found that the phosphorylated Ser10 peptide is a moderately effective inhibitor of the enzyme (Ki of 31 μm) (TABLE TWO). This observation suggests that the phosphorylated peptide is still able to bind (although weakly) to LSD1, but its binding mode is nonproductive so that it cannot be oxidized. In other words, the phosphate group on Ser10 appears to prevent the catalytically competent positioning of the methylated Lys4 inside the active site (Fig. 4). The main theme emerging from these data is that LSD1 is finely tuned and highly specific. This finding has profound implications for the control of histone H3 demethylation and its role in chromatin biology. A first important observation is that LSD1 does not have a strong preference for mono- or dimethylated H3-K4. This feature contrasts with the properties of many lysine methyltransferases that specifically perform the addition only of the first, second, or third methyl group on a Lys residue (18Cheng X. Collins R.E. Zhang X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2005; 34: 267-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The fact that LSD1 acts with similar efficiency (TABLE ONE) on mono- and dimethylated substrates indicates that the in vivo function of LSD1 is to reset H3-K4 to its demethylated “ground” state. We have shown that an H3 peptide must contain the first ∼20 N-terminal amino acids of H3 in order to be a substrate. The sequence of this polypeptide stretch has many charged residues, and electrostatic interactions are likely to dominate the protein-substrate association, providing a rationale for the high sensitivity of Km to ionic strength. This ability of recognizing a “long” and “heavily charged” segment of the histone N-terminal tail enables LSD1 to detect the presence of multiple post-translational modifications written in the H3 tail (Fig. 5). In this regard, several important functional properties have been unraveled. (i) LSD1 has an exquisite specificity. Although the site of oxidative attack is Lys4, the enzyme senses covalent modifications on neighboring residues. (ii) The charge distribution on the histone N-terminal tail appears to be a key determinant in the readout of the histone code by LSD1, as exemplified by the differential effects of methylation and acetylation of Lys9 on enzyme activity. (iii) The Lys4 demethylase activity of LSD1 is not affected by methylation of Lys9, which is generally known to cause gene repression. (iv) Acetylated Lys9 and phosphorylated Ser10 cross-talk and act synergistically in the Lys4 demethylation process. Ser10 dephosphorylation is a prerequisite for LSD1 function, whereas Lys9 deacetylation significantly improves activity mainly through an increase in substrate affinity. (v) These features provide insight into the order and interplay of the events that lead to transcriptional repression. Dephosphorylation of Ser10 by a phosphatase must precede H3 demethylation catalyzed by LSD1, emphasizing the role of Ser10 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in triggering the cascades of events that lead to transcriptional activation/repression. Lys9 deacetylation by HDAC1/2 (which are typically associated with LSD1) makes H3 more susceptible to LSD1-catalyzed demethylation. The activity of LSD1 can be modulated by its associated protein factors (11Shi Y.J. Matson C. Lan F. Iwase S. Baba T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 857-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 13Metzger E. Wissmann M. Yin N. Muller J.M. Schneider R. Peters A.H. Gunther T. Buettner R. Schule R.

Nature. 2005; 437: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), and the enzyme specificity observed on free peptides might be different when chromatin and nucleosomes are used as substrates. However, it is of notice that the lower efficiency observed with a peptide acetylated on Lys9 is consistent with the finding by Shi et al. (11Shi Y.J. Matson C. Lan F. Iwase S. Baba T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 857-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) that LSD1 is more active toward hypoacetylated nucleosomes. LSD1 binds with significant affinity (TABLE TWO) to a demethylated H3 peptide, as indicated by an inhibition constant that compares with the Km for the peptide substrates. The measured affinity is similar to the affinity measured for other H3-binding proteins such as the chromodomain-containing proteins HP1 (19Jacobs S.A. Taverna S.D. Zhang Y. Briggs S.D. Li J. Eissenberg J.C. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5232-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and Polycomb (20Fischle W. Wang Y. Jacobs S.A. Kim Y. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). This finding raises the intriguing hypothesis that LSD1 plays a double role, namely that of Lys4-specific demethylase and of H3 N-terminal tail binder. LSD1 is member of the co-repressor complex CoREST-HDAC1/2, a module that has been found in association with several large multiprotein complexes. The finding that LSD1 has significant affinity for the H3 peptide indicates that it could serve as a docking module for the stabilization of the associated corepressor complex(es) on chromatin. At least in one case, it has been demonstrated that the CoREST corepressor complex remains bound to chromatin after the release of the DNA-binding protein responsible for its initial recruitment (21Ballas N. Grunseich C. Lu D.D. Speh J.C. Mandel G. Cell. 2005; 121: 645-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The main conclusion from these studies is that LSD1 is not only a chromatin-modifying enzyme, but it is able to interpret histone marks on the Lys9-Ser10 locus and to stabilize the co-repressor complex by binding to the demethylated H3. Knowledge of LSD1 substrate specificity properties will provide a framework for future inhibitor design studies. The continuous interest of A. Coda, E. Ginelli, and G.

We demonstrate that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was released by Gr-1+CD11b- neutrophils but not Gr-1-CD11b+ monocytes prestimulated with G-CSF in vitro and in vivo. Similarly, in vivo, concomitant with an increase in neutrophil numbers in circulation, G-CSF augmented plasma VEGF level in vivo. Local G-CSF administration into ischemic tissue increased capillary density and provided a functional vasculature and contributed to neovascularization of ischemic tissue. Blockade of the VEGF pathway abrogated G-CSF-induced angiogenesis. On the other hand, as we had shown previously, VEGF can induce endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) mobilization. Here, we show that G-CSF also augmented the number of circulating VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) EPCs as compared with untreated controls. Blocking the VEGF/VEGFR1, but to a much lesser extent, the VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway in G-CSF-treated animals delayed tissue revascularization in a hindlimb model. These data clearly show that G-CSF modulates angiogenesis by increasing myelomonocytic cells (VEGFR1+ neutrophils) and their release of VEGF. Our results indicated that administration of G-CSF into ischemic tissue provides a novel and safe therapeutic strategy to improve neovascularization."

SST changes at both periodicities were synchronous with eastern Pacific cold-tongue SSTs but preceded changes in continental ice volume. The timing and nature of tropical Pacific SST changes over the mid-Pleistocene transition implicate a shift in the periodicity of radiative forcing by atmospheric carbon dioxide as the cause of the switch in climate periodicities at this time."

The precise function of both PKD gene products polycystins (PCs) 1 and 2 remain controversial. PC2 has been localized to numerous cellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and cilia. It is unclear what pools are the most relevant to its physiological function as a putative Ca2+ channel. We employed a Xenopus oocyte Ca2+ imaging system to directly investigate the role of PC2 in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent Ca2+ signaling. Cytosolic Ca2+ signals were recorded following UV photolysis of caged IP3 in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. We demonstrated that overexpression of PC2, as well as type I IP3 receptor (IP3R), significantly prolonged the half-decay time (t½) of IP3-induced Ca2+ transients. However, overexpressing the disease-associated PC2 mutants, the point mutation D511V, and the C-terminally truncated mutation R742X did not alter the t½. In addition, we found that D511V overexpression significantly reduced the amplitude of IP3-induced Ca2+ transients. Interestingly, overexpression of the C terminus of PC2 not only significantly reduced the amplitude but also prolonged the t½. Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that PC2 physically interacts with IP3R through its C terminus. Taken together, our data suggest that PC2 and IP3R functionally interact and modulate intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Therefore, mutations in either PC1 or PC2 could result in the misregulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling, which in turn could contribute to the pathology of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease."

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 43Fiumicino S. Martinelli S. Colussi C. Aquilina G. Leonetti C. Crescenzi M. Bignami M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). By contrast, the less abundant UV light-induced photoproduct, the (6-4) photoproduct, is well bound by DDB, yet an absence of DDB in cells has little or no effect on the repair of (6-4) photoproducts (6Tang J. Chu G. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism of DDB action, we produced highly purified recombinant DDB protein complex to investigate and quantify the preference of DDB for binding to different types of DNA damage. We found that DDB is indeed able to efficiently discriminate a single CPD from nondamaged DNA. Further, we found that DDB can bind avidly to abasic (AP) sites in DNA, to DNA containing mismatches without a covalent lesion, and to “compound” lesions containing both mismatches and lesions. A DDB complex containing amino acid substitutions in the DDB2 subunit, as found in XP-E, patients is greatly deficient in binding to damaged DNA. Plasmid Constructs—To overproduce tagged DDB1 and DDB2, 5′ primers containing the tags and an SpeI restriction site were used in PCR reactions together with a 3′ primer containing a SpeI site. The fragments (N′-His10-FLAG-TEV-DDB2, N′-His10-FLAG-TEV-DDB1, and N′-His10-DDB1) were then cloned into pBlueBac4.5/V5-His (according to the Invitrogen instructions for Topo® cloning). All constructs were sequenced to be sure that no mutations were introduced by PCR. FLAG-tagged DDB2 virus was made as described (20Rapic-Otrin V. Navazza V. Nardo T. Botta E. McLenigan M.P. Bisi D.C. Levine A.S. Stefanini M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1507-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Single amino acid substitutions K244E and R273H in DDB2 were introduced by the two-stage, PCR-based overlap extension method (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar). To facilitate purification of the recombinant mutant DDB complexes, the wild type and mutant DDB2 genes were fused to DNA encoding a His10-FLAG-TEV tag at the N terminus. Plasmids for generating the viral stocks were sequenced to verify the mutation before transfection. For R273H, DNA from the large scale virus stock used for protein expression was extracted, and the sequence was re-verified. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant baculoviruses encoding DDB1 and DDB2 were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen Bac-N-Blue). Sf9 insect cells were infected with virus encoding each subunit alone or co-infected with two baculoviruses to obtain a DDB complex and incubated for 48 h at 27 °C. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen. Buffer A (300 mm KCl, 50 mm potassium phosphate pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) was added, the pellet was thawed on ice, and extracts were prepared in a Dounce homogenizer with an A-type pestle. After centrifugation for 45 min at 41,000 rpm in a Sorvall T.647.5 rotor, the cleared lysate was adjusted to 10 mm imidazole and applied to a nickel-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole. After washing extensively with buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, the protein was then eluted with buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole, and peak fractions were applied to a column containing anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 20 volumes of buffer A and subsequently eluted with buffer A containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The yield of pure DDB complex was ∼200 μg/liter Sf9 culture. The fractions collected were stored at –80 °C. An EDTA-free protease inhibitor mix was added to all buffers used in the protein purification (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblotting analysis of the complex was performed on 4–15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad). Gels were electrophoresed at 40 mA for 1.5 h and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF) overnight at 30 V. The membrane was blocked with 20% dry milk, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature in 5% milk, 1× PBS, and 0.1% Tween. Primary antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Vesna Rapic-Otrin and used as described (22Rapic-Otrin V. McLenigan M.P. Bisi D.C. Gonzalez M. Levine A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2588-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). After washing in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated for 30 min with a secondary horseradish peroxidase antibody, washed, and visualized by using a Femto signal kit (Pierce). DNA Substrates—TABLE ONE shows a schematic representation of the 30-mer duplex substrates utilized. The sequence of the top strand was 5′-CTCGTCAGCATCTTCATCATACAGTCAGG-3′ (position of UV radiation photoproducts shown in boldface). The sequence of one strand of the 49-mer was 5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCCTGCACGAATTAAGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCT-3′ (position of UV radiation photoproducts shown in boldface). Single-stranded DNA and duplex DNA substrates used for binding assays and two-dimensional gel analysis were all 32P-5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). Substrates, except for those containing the CPD and the (6-4) photoproduct, were purchased high performance liquid chromatography-purified from Sigma-Genosys and were >95% pure. Substrates containing CPD and (6-4) photoproduct were made as described (23Murata T. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Iwai S.

Annealing of duplexes was done by adding a 2-fold molar excess of the unlabeled strand, heating to 95 °C for 5 min, and then cooling down to 20 °C. Single-stranded DNA was irradiated (where indicated) with a 254-nm peak, germicidal UV-C light at a dose of 18 kJ/m2.TABLE ONE30-mer duplex DNA substrates used in this studySubstratesPrimersUDaUD, undamaged DNA.5′-CTCGTCAGCATCTTCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′UDaUD, undamaged DNA.3′-GAGCAGTCGTAGAAGTAGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′AP site5′-CTCGTCAGCATC-TCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′AP site3′-GAGCAGTCGTAGAAGTAGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′CPD:AA5′-CTCGTCAGCATCT<>TCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′CPD:AA3′-GAGCAGTCGTAG AA GTAGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′CPD:AC5′-CTCGTCAGCATCT<>TCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′CPD:AC3′-GAGCAGTCGTAG AC GTAGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′CPD:CC5′-CTCGTCAGCATCT<>TCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′CPD:CC3′-GAGCAGTCGTAG CC GTAGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′6-4:AAb6-4, 6-4 photoproduct.5′-CTCGTCAGCATCT\TCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′6-4:AAb6-4, 6-4 photoproduct.3′-GAGCAGTCGTAG AA GTAGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′6-4:ACb6-4, 6-4 photoproduct.5′-CTCGTCAGCATCT\TCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′6-4:ACb6-4, 6-4 photoproduct.3′-GAGCAGTCGTAG AC GTAGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′6-4:CCb6-4, 6-4 photoproduct.5′-CTCGTCAGCATCT\TCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′6-4:CCb6-4, 6-4 photoproduct.3′-GAGCAGTCGTAG CC GTAGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′1MMcMM, mismatches.5′-CTCGTCAGCATCTTCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′1MMcMM, mismatches.3′-GAGCAGTCGTAGACGTAGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′2MMcMM, mismatches.5′-CTCGTCAGCATCTTCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′2MMcMM, mismatches.3′-GAGCAGTCGTAGCCGTAGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′3MMcMM, mismatches.5′-CTCGTCAGCATCTTTATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′3MMcMM, mismatches.3′-GAGCAGTCGTAGCCCTAGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′4MMcMM, mismatches.5′-CTCGTCAGCATCTTTTTCATACAGTCAGTG-3′4MMcMM, mismatches.3′-GAGCAGTCGTAGCCCCAGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′5MMcMM, mismatches.5′-CTCGTCAGCATCTTTTTCATACAGTCAGTG-3′5MMcMM, mismatches.3′-GAGCAGTCGTAGCCCCCGTATGTCAGTCAC-5′a UD, undamaged DNA.b 6-4, 6-4 photoproduct.c MM, mismatches. Open table in a new tab Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—1 ng (2.6 nm concentration) of 32P-labeled substrate was incubated at 20 °C with the indicated amount of recombinant protein for 30 min in a 20-μl reaction volume (0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol). Time courses showed that all binding reactions were complete within 15 min. The protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel at 175 V for 2 h and visualized by autoradiography. The dried gels were exposed to an imaging screen, and quantification was carried out using a Fuji FLA 3000 Bioimager with ImageQuant software. The graphs shown are each from a single experiment, and all results were verified by repeat experiments. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The DDB binding reactions were performed as described above except that 12 ng (18.6 nm) of probe was incubated with 100 ng (28.6 nm) of DDB in each reaction. The first dimension of the gel was run according to the description above for an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Two identical lanes were run, one for exposure and one for processing in the second dimension. The lane was excised and cast into the stacking region of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4% stacking and 8% resolving). A modified gel comb allowed a size marker and a control sample of the DDB complex to be included in the second dimension. The gel was then transferred to a PVDF membrane and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Expression and Purification of the DDB Heterodimer and Single Subunits—To obtain highly purified DDB protein, the recombinant DDB1-DDB2 heterodimer and the single DDB1 and DDB2 subunits were expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus system. For purification of the single DDB1 and DDB2 subunits, each was fused to a FLAG-His10-TEV tag at the N terminus. To facilitate purification of the heterodimeric complex, the N terminus of the DDB2 subunit was fused to a nine-amino acid FLAG tag, and the N terminus of the DDB1 subunit was fused to a 10-amino acid His tag. This ensured that after passing extracts containing the co-expressed heterodimer over both anti-FLAG-M2 affinity gel and nickel-NTA columns, only the DDB1-DDB2 complex was purified. The DDB1-DDB2 complex was purified 1550-fold from whole cell lysates by this two-step scheme (Fig. 1A). In addition to the DDB1-DDB2 complex, this procedure yielded highly purified individual DDB1 and DDB2 proteins (Fig. 1B) with a size and subunit composition confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1C). In preparations of the DDB2 subunit alone, a substantial amount of DDB2 was insoluble, and a polypeptide of ∼ 60 kDa was reproducibly present that did not react with DDB2 antibody. This polypeptide could not be separated from DDB2 even in buffers containing 1 m NaCl or 40% ethylene glycol (data not shown). This 60-kDa peptide derived from insect cells is likely a tightly bound chaperone that solubilizes DDB2 in the absence of DDB1. DDB1 and DDB2 Associate to Form DDB Unaided by Other Protein Factors and Remain in the Complex following Binding—A simple mechanistic question that has not been investigated directly by utilizing pure protein preparations is whether both the DDB1 and DDB2 subunits are required for DNA binding. To investigate this, a 30-bp duplex containing a centrally placed (6-4) photoproduct (TABLE ONE) was used in an EMSA. Binding activity was reconstituted only when the two subunits were mixed together (Fig. 1D, lane 4) and not with either of the single subunits. The position of the mobility shift was identical to that of DDB complex where the two subunits were co-purified (Fig. 1D, lane 5) and identical to that obtained with HeLa cell extract (not shown). Both subunits are therefore necessary and sufficient for binding to the DNA substrate. Two or more bands of distinct mobilities appeared in the EMSA, as noted in other studies (18Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To determine whether all of these bands contained both subunits of DDB protein or if only one subunit was present, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to separate the components of the different DNA-bound complexes (Fig. 1E). A 49-bp DNA duplex with a centrally located (6-4) photoproduct was incubated with DDB1-DDB2 complex and electrophoresed on a 5% non-denaturing gel. Two identical lanes were run. One lane was excised and prepared for autoradiography to record migration in the first dimension and the other was excised and cast into the stacking section of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The polypeptides were separated in this second dimension together with a control sample containing the DDB1-DDB2 complex. Proteins were then visualized by immunoblotting and aligned with an autoradiograph of the first dimension gel (Fig. 1E). Each of the shifted complexes (labeled C1 and C2) detected in the first dimension EMSA contained both DDB1 and DDB2 subunits in the same ratio and, consequently, both DDB subunits remained in these complexes after DNA was bound. DDB Can Recognize a Single CPD or AP Site in DNA—The major phenotype of cells lacking DDB activity is their extremely low capacity to remove CPD from their genomes by NER, with a milder defect in removal of (6-4) photoproducts (13Wakasugi M.

Paradoxically, experiments have suggested that DDB is unable to discriminate a cis-syn CPD from undamaged DNA (17Batty D.P. Otrin V.R. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. J. Mol.

However, competitor DNA such as poly(dI-dC) is in most cases included in the binding reaction mixtures to lower the background arising from the binding of damaged DNA by contaminating proteins. The addition of competitor to binding reactions can potentially mask binding of DDB to some substrates. Few studies have employed single defined lesions, complicating the assessment of affinity of DNA for various types of DNA damage. To better understand the features in damaged DNA sensed by DDB, we used single lesions and highly purified recombinant DDB complex so that nonspecific competitor DNA could be omitted. Four different 30-mer DNA duplex substrates with centrally located single alterations (TABLE ONE) were tested (Fig. 2A). Measurements were initially carried out with equimolar amounts of DDB and DNA substrate. Under conditions where 87% of the (6-4) photoproduct substrate was bound, there was 29% binding to the CPD substrate, 89% binding to DNA containing an AP site, and 15% binding to undamaged duplex (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11). For comparison with results obtained in previous studies, binding to the substrates was also tested in the presence of 0.5 μg/reaction poly(dI-dC) (a molar excess of 500-fold over 30-mer). This procedure virtually abolished binding to undamaged DNA while retaining 3% binding to the CPD, 36% to the AP site, and 67% to the (6-4) photoproduct. These data show that DDB can efficiently discriminate between a CPD and non-damaged DNA, but that this discrimination can be obscured by competition with an excess of poly(dI-dC). Binding of DDB to Base-Base Mismatches—UV radiation photoproducts and AP sites cause loss of base pairing potential, with accompanying distortions in double-stranded DNA. We therefore asked whether DDB might bind to DNA containing only mispaired, undamaged bases. A set of 30-bp DNA duplex substrates was created with 1–5 T residues mismatched to C residues on the opposite strand (TABLE ONE). The experiments were done with a 1:2 ratio of substrate to DDB in the absence or presence of poly(dI-dC). These mismatched substrates were indeed better bound by DDB than by paired DNA (Fig. 2B). The substrates with two or three base mismatches were bound most avidly (88% for two mismatches and 75% for three mismatches in the absence of competitor), and substrates containing one, four, or five mispairs were bound less well (17–26% in the absence of competitor). Substrates containing a centrally located T loop of varying length creating a bulge were not bound by DDB better than by nondamaged DNA (data not shown). We also tested several different single-stranded substrates in the EMSA assay using a 10-fold molar excess of protein. A poly(dT) 50-mer with minimal self-pairing potential was not bound by DDB, whether unirradiated or irradiated. A 49-mer substrate with a mixed nucleotide content containing either no lesion or a single (6-4) photoproduct or CPD was bound marginally (1–3%), and irradiation of the 49-nucleotide substrate increased binding by 3-fold (to 8%). It is possible that photoproduct formation promotes limited internal pairing in the substrate that is bound by DDB. We conclude that the binding of DDB to substrates with reduced base pairing potential such as mismatches, AP sites, and (6-4) photoproducts cannot be explained by recognition of single-stranded DNA character. Comparative Affinity of DDB for Different Lesions—To obtain more detailed information on the affinity of DDB for various substrates, titration experiments were performed in the absence of competitor. Maximum binding close to 100% could be obtained for all of the substrates (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Apparent equilibrium affinity constants (Kappa) for those substrates were estimated by determining the DDB concentration at which 50% of the substrate was bound. The affinity for the CPD photolesion was 1 × 108 m–1, 6-fold higher than the affinity for undamaged DNA (1.8 × 107 m–1). The estimates for binding affinity to the (6-4) photoproduct (1.5 × 109 m–1), the AP site (8.3 × 108 m–1), and the two mismatch (9.1 × 108 m–1) constitute minimal affinities, as binding was so avid that there is not a vast molar excess of protein at the DDB concentration at which 50% of the substrate was bound. Competition experiments were also performed by incubating the different substrates with a 10-fold molar excess of DDB and the indicated amounts of poly(dI-dC) (Fig. 2D). The results confirm the order of affinities for the different substrates established above and show that addition of poly(dI-dC) eliminates the binding of DDB to both undamaged DNA and to DNA containing a CPD. DDB Does Not Detect DNA lesions per se but Recognizes Distortions in Duplex DNA—Given the above results, we next asked whether DDB has an increased affinity for DNA containing both a photoproduct and a mismatch (Fig. 3). Several substrates with such “compound lesions” were tested (TABLE ONE). The potential for base pairing across from the CPD was eliminated by placing an AC or CC sequence across from the lesion instead of the normal AA. This increased the binding of DDB from 26% for the “paired” CPD:AA to 88% for the CPD:CC (Fig. 3). The latter value was similar to that obtained for the paired (6-4) photoproduct (6-4:AA); introducing mispairs opposite the (6-4) photoproduct did not give significantly higher binding. As these values were obtained at near saturation, titration experiments were performed for the double mismatched substrates (data not shown; as for other substrates, maximum binding was very close to 100%). A minimum estimate of the apparent equilibrium affinity constant Kappa for the CPD:CC substrate was 1.1 × 109 m–1, a 10-fold high"

Chem. 2001; 276: 68976900Google Scholar), KLF5 appears to suppress cell growth in cancer cells (1Chen C. Bhalala H.V. Vessella R.L. Dong J.T. Prostate. 2003; 55: 8188Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 2Chen C. Bhalala H.V. Qiao H. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 65676572Google Scholar, 3Bateman N.W. Tan D. Pestell R.G. Black J.D. Black A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12093-12101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, KLF5 is haplo-insufficient (7Shindo T. Manabe I. Fukushima Y. Tobe K. Aizawa K. Miyamoto S. Kawai-Kowase K. Moriyama N. Imai Y. Kawakami H. Nishimatsu H. Ishikawa T. Suzuki T. Morita H. Maemura K. Sata M. Hirata Y. Komukai M. Kagechika H. Kadowaki T.

Prostate. 2003; 55: 8188Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 2Chen C. Bhalala H.V. Qiao H. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 65676572Google Scholar), which indicates a loss of function for KLF5 during carcinogenesis. KLF5 apparently has an important role in cancer, though the molecular mechanisms of its function remain to be elucidated.The activity of KLF5 is strictly regulated at both transcriptional and post-translational levels, and alterations in the regulation of KLF5 are associated with human cancer. KLF5 mRNA is highly expressed in normal epithelial cells such as those from the prostate, breast, and intestine, but is frequently down-regulated in cancer cells (1Chen C. Bhalala H.V. Vessella R.L. Dong J.T. Prostate. 2003; 55: 8188Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 2Chen C. Bhalala H.V. Qiao H. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 65676572Google Scholar, 3Bateman N.W. Tan D. Pestell R.G.

KLF5 has also been demonstrated to be a responsive gene of H-Ras (6Nandan M.O. Yoon H.S. Zhao W. Ouko L.A. Chanchevalap S. Yang V.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3404-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), Wnt-1 (13Taneyhill L. Pennica D. BMC Dev.

Moreover, several carcinogens and growth factors including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, sphingosine 1-phosphate, androgen, and fibroblast growth factor can induce KLF5 expression (9Usui S.

Gene (Amst.). 2004; 330: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). On the post-translational level, phosphorylation of KLF5 at its CREB-binding protein (CBP) interaction region by protein kinase C increases its transactivation activity (17Zhang Z. Teng C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2196-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and acetylation of KLF5 at its zinc finger domain is regulated positively by the acetylase p300 but negatively by the SET and the acetylase HDAC1 (18Miyamoto S. Suzuki T. Muto S. Aizawa K. Kimura A. Mizuno Y. Nagino T. Imai Y. Adachi N. Horikoshi M. Nagai R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23 (8541): 8528Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Matsumura T.

Recently, we demonstrated that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) is an important mechanism for the regulation of the KLF5 protein (20Chen C. Sun X. Ran Q. Wilkinson K.D. Murphy T.J. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3319-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We further found that the proteolysis of KLF5 appears to be more active in cancer cells than in untransformed epithelial cells (20Chen C. Sun X. Ran Q. Wilkinson K.D. Murphy T.J. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3319-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).In this study, we searched for the E3 ligase that targets KLF5 for UPP-mediated degradation and examined how degradation of KLF5 becomes hyperactive in cancer cells. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP1 targets KLF5 for proteolysis. Furthermore, overexpression of WWP1, primarily through the gain of gene copy number for WWP1 at 8q21, appears to be responsible for overdegradation of KLF5 in human cancer cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructions—Expression plasmids for KLF5 mutants PY1, PY2, and PY1-2 were constructed from pcDNA3-KLF5-FLAG, in which a FLAG tag is attached to the C terminus of KLF5, using PCR-based approaches as described previously (20Chen C. Sun X. Ran Q. Wilkinson K.D. Murphy T.J. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3319-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, one PCR product was generated with the forward primer, F1 (5′-GATCTAGATATGCCCAGTTC-3′) (XbaI site is underlined) and the reverse primer, PY2R (5′-TTGTAGCAGCCTGGAGCATCTCTGCTT-3′). Another PCR product was generated with the forward primer, PY2F (5′-GATGCTCCAGGCTGCTACAATTGCTTCT-3′) and the reverse primer, R1 (5′-TGGATGTTTTGTGAGTTAACTGG-3′). (The HpaI site is underlined.) These two PCR products, which overlap partially, were purified and used as templates to amplify a full-length PCR product using primers F1 and R1. The new PCR products were digested with XbaI and HpaI to prepare the insert, which was used to replace the counterpart in pcDNA3-KLF5-FLAG. Eight amino acids, i.e. NLTPPPSY from codon 321 to codon 328 (PY motif 2), were deleted in the resultant plasmid PY2. PY1 and PY1-2 were constructed using the same strategy based on pcDNA3-KLF5-FLAG and PY2. Five amino acid residues (PPCTY from codon 282 to 286 or PY motif 1) were removed in the PY1 construct. In the PY1-2 construct, both PY motifs were deleted. All clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Myc-tagged wild-type and mutant WWP1 constructs, i.e. Myc-WWP1 and Myc-WWP1C886S, have been reported in a previous study (21Zhang X. Srinivasan S.V. Lingrel J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). FLAG-WWP2 and FLAG-AIP4 constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Richard Longnecker from North-western University (22Ikeda M. Ikeda A. Longnecker R. Virology. 2002; 300: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2 constructs were gifts from Dr. Olivier Staub at the University of Lausanne (23Abriel H. Kamynina E. Horisberger J.D. Staub O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfection—The 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, HEPES (0.1 m), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), sodium bicarbonate (0.15%), glucose (0.45%), and penicillin and streptomycin (1%). The 293FT cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids were transfected into the 22Rv1 cells using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent following the manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen).Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—Western blot experiments including those for ubiquitination analysis were performed as described in our previous study (20Chen C. Sun X. Ran Q. Wilkinson K.D. Murphy T.J. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3319-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc antibody was conducted following the standard protocol (Cell Signaling) with minor modifications. Briefly, to transfected 22Rv1 cells in each 100-mm culture dish were added 0.6 ml of 1× ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm fresh phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cells were scraped off the plate and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Then, cell lysates were sonicated four times (5 s each time) on ice and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (200 μl) and primary anti-Myc antibody (2 μl) were incubated with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. 30 μl of 50% protein A-agarose beads (Upstate, Waltham, MA) were added and incubated for 1-3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with 500 μl of 1× cell lysis buffer. Proteins were resuspended with 20-50 μl of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting.Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—22Rv1 cells were seeded into a 16-well chamber slide. The Myc-WWP1C886S and KLF5 were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 on the second day. Forty-eight hours later, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. After blocking with 10% goat serum for 1 h, cells were incubated with diluted primary anti-KLF5 Ab (rabbit, 1:200) and anti-Myc Ab (mouse, 1:2000) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Following five washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with 1:200-diluted rhodamine-red X-conjugated affinipure goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 labeling goat antimouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). After 1 h of incubation and five washes with phosphate-buffered saline, slides were mounted and examined by confocal microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss, Germany).Purification of GST Fusion Proteins from Bacteria—A DNA fragment encoding mouse WWP1 (mWWP1) or its mutant (mWWP1C886S) was amplified with PCR using primers 5′-TTGGATCCATGGCCACTGCTTCACCAAG-3′ (BamHI site is underlined) and 5′-TTGAATTCATTCTTGTCCAAATCCCTCTG-3′ (EcoRI site is underlined) and cloned into the pGEX-6p-1 GST fusion protein expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The construct was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene), and the GST fusion protein was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at room temperature. The fusion protein was purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) from 1 liter of culture. Purified GST fusion protein was eluted into 10 mm reduced glutathione. The protein was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining to determine the purity. The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad).In Vitro Translation—DNA templates for wild-type KLF5 and its mutants with one or both PY motifs were generated by PCR using the forward primer: 5′-GGATCCTAATACGACT CACTATAGGAACAGACCACCATGGCTACAAGGGTGCTGAG-3′ (the T7 promoter sequence is underlined, the start codon ATG is in bold; this primer was purified by SDS-PAGE after synthesis) and the reverse primer: 5′-TTTCTAGACTACTTGTCATCGT CGTCCTTGTAATCGTTCTGGTGCCTCTTCATAT-3′. (The stop codon is in bold.) RNA transcription and protein translation were performed in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) using the TnT® Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega) following the accompanying protocol.GST Pull-down Assay—Equal molar amounts of purified GST fusion proteins (GST, GST-WWP1, or GST-WWP1C886S) were immobilized to 50 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B slurry beads (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.5 ml of GST pull-down binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5% CA630). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation, beads were washed three times with GST pull-down binding buffer and resuspended in 0.5 ml of GST pull-down binding buffer. 10 μl of 35S-labeled in vitro translated protein (KLF5, PY1, PY2, or PY1-2) were added and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed twice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and 1 ml of cold PBS buffer, respectively. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 30 μl of loading buffer. GST protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and the 35S-labeled protein was detected by autoradiography.Ubiquitin Conjugation Assay in Vitro—The Ubiquitin-Protein Conjugation kit (BostonBiochem, Cambridge, MA) was used for the in vitro ubiquitination assay. Briefly, 2 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate-translated 35S-labeled KLF5 was incubated in the absence or presence of bacterially expressed GST-WWP1 (2.5 μg), 8 μg of fraction A, 8 μg of fraction B, 26 μg of ubiquitin, 4 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, and 2.5 μl of energy solution (10×) in a 25-μl volume. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reactions were stopped with 25 μl of 3× sample loading buffer. Samples were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for autoradiography.RT-PCR and Real-time PCR—Forward primer, 5′-GTATGGATCCTGTACGGCAGCA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GTTGTGGTCTCTCCCATGTGGT-3′ were used to perform regular RT-PCR and SYBR real-time RT-PCR to examine the expression of the human WWP1 gene. KLF5 and β-actin primers were described in our previous study (1Chen C. Bhalala H.V. Vessella R.L. Dong J.T. Prostate. 2003; 55: 8188Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Primers used for the PDGFA gene are 5′-TCCACGCCACTAAGCATGTG-3′ and 5′-CGTAAATGACCGTCCTGGTCTT-3′. Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent following standard protocols (Invitrogen). The cDNA was prepared using a Script kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad).For gene amplification, primers were designed to flank exon/intron boundaries. The primer sequences for the human WWP1 are 5′-CAGGAGGTTGACTTGGCAGA-3′ and 5′-AAACTGTGTCCAAAAGCAGTCTC-3′. SYBR real-time PCR was performed in triplicate in an ABI 7000 thermal cycler. The Ct values in log linear range representing the detection threshold values were used for quantitating by the ΔΔCt method.siRNA Transfection—An siRNA with the sequence of 5′-GAGTTGATGATCGTAGAAG-3′ was designed to target WWP1. The luciferase control siRNA was used as a negative control. PC-3 cells were transfected with 200 nm chemically synthesized siRNA (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) using siPORT Amine (Ambion, Austin, TX) in 12-well plates. RNA and protein were collected 48 h after transfection.Luciferase Assays—The PDGFA gene promoter was amplified from human genomic DNA by PCR. The primer sequences are: 5′-TTCTCGAGGGCGGGGGCGGGGGCG-3′ and 5′-TTAAGCTTCGCAGGGCGCGCGTGTGGA-3′. Two restriction endonuclease recognition sites, XhoI and HindIII (underlined), were attached to the primers for subsequent cloning. The PCR product was purified from agarose gel, digested with XhoI and HindIII, and subcloned into the pGL3BASIC plasmid, which is a promoterless luciferase expression vector (Promega). The construct was verified by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. The measurement of luciferase activity was described in our previous study (16Chen C. Zhou Y. Zhou Z. Sun X. Otto K.B. Uht R.M. Dong J.T. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 330: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).RESULTSWWP1 Targets KLF5 for Proteolysis through the Proteasome—We previously found that the KLF5 protein is significantly stabilized by the deletion of a 56-amino acid (codon 293-348) degradation signal adjacent to its transactivation domain (20Chen C. Sun X. Ran Q. Wilkinson K.D. Murphy T.J. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3319-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the 56-amino acid sequence is a PY motif (PPPSY, codons 324-328), which could recruit WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases in the Nedd4 family, including Nedd4, WWP1 (AIP5), AIP4 (Itch), and WWP2 (AIP2) (24Verdecia M.A. Joazeiro C.A. Wells N.J. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 25Mosser E.A. Kasanov J.D. Forsberg E.C. Kay B.K. Ney P.A. Bresnick E.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13686-13695Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To search for KLF5-specific E3 ligases, we cotransfected KLF5 and each of the five E3 ubiquitin ligases from the Nedd4 family into 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells and examined the degradation of KLF5 protein by immunoblotting. We found that only WWP1 significantly degraded KLF5 protein (Fig. 1A), suggesting that WWP1 could be a specific E3 ligase for KLF5.To further test whether WWP1 affects the degradation of KLF5 protein, the Myc-tagged mouse WWP1 and a FLAG-tagged human KLF5 were cotransfected into the 22Rv1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, expression of WWP1 led to remarkable KLF5 proteolysis in a dose-dependent manner, which was partly blocked by the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Furthermore, measurement of the KLF5 half-life indicated that expression of WWP1 dramatically decreased the half-life of KLF5 in 22Rv1 cells, as determined by the cycloheximide chase assay (Fig. 1, C and D).WWP1 Interacts with KLF5 in Vivo and in Vitro—To test whether WWP1 directly interacts with KLF5 at the protein level, we cotransfected the KLF5-FLAG plasmid with the Myc-WWP1C886S plasmid into 22Rv1 cells. In the Myc-WWP1C886S expression construct, the catalytic cysteine at nucleotide 886 was replaced with a serine, which prevented the degradation of KLF5 mediated by WWP1 (see below for details) and made it possible to detect the interaction between KLF5 and WWP1. As shown in Fig. 2A, KLF5 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody in the protein complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody from WWP1C886S-cotransfected cells (lane 2). In the immunoprecipitates from the vector control (lane 1), however, no KLF5 was detectable (lane 1). In addition, a FLAG-tagged control protein, FLAG-Parkin, could not be co-immunoprecipitated with WWP1C886S, although the expression level of this protein was not lower than that of the KLF5-FLAG in cell lysates as determined by the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that specific interaction between KLF5 and WWP1 proteins occurred in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells when the genes for these proteins were co-transfected.FIGURE 2Protein association of WWP1 with KLF5 in vivo and in vitro. A, co-immunoprecipitation of KLF5 with WWP1. The 22Rv1 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged KLF5 (KLF5-FLAG) and Myc-tagged mutant WWP1 (WWP1C886S) for immunoprecipitation (IP), which was followed by Western blotting. FLAG-tagged Parkin (FLAG-Parkin) was used as a negative control. Cells were treated with MG132 (20 μm) for 4 h before collection. The lower two panels were from cell lysates without IP. B, WWP1 interacts with endogenous KLF5 in 293FT cells. The 293FT cells were transfected with Myc-WWP1C886S and treated with MG132 (20 μm) for 4 h before collection at 24 h. C, pull-down of in vitro translated KLF5 protein by both wild-type (GST-WWP1) and mutant (GST-WWP1C886S) WWP1 but not by GST alone. D, co-localization of KLF5 and WWP1 in the nucleus of 22Rv1 cells as determined by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether WWP1 directly interacts with endogenous KLF5, we expressed the Myc-tagged WWP1C886S in 293FT cells in which endogenous KLF5 can be detected in the presence of MG132. As shown in Fig. 2B, the Myc-WWP1C886S is immunoprecipitated by anti-KLF5 antibody but not control immunoglobin. These results suggest that WWP1 interacts with endogenous KLF5 in 293FT cells.To determine whether WWP1 directly interacts with KLF5 in vitro, we performed a GST pull-down experiment using GST-WWP1 fusion proteins and in vitro translated KLF5 proteins. Both wild-type (GST-WWP1) and mutant (GST-WWP1C886S) WWP1 could pull-down KLF5 protein, but the GST protein alone could not bind to KLF5 protein under the same conditions (Fig. 2C). Therefore, WWP1 directly interacts with KLF5 at the protein level. To further test the interaction between WWP1 and KLF5, we transfected KLF5 and Myc-WWP1C886S into 22Rv1 cells, and detected their proteins by immunofluorescence staining. Fig. 2D shows localization of KLF5 is in the nucleus, which is consistent with our previous observation (20Chen C. Sun X. Ran Q. Wilkinson K.D. Murphy T.J. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3319-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The distribution of WWP1, however, is on the membrane as well as in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Co-localization of WWP1 and KLF5 in the nucleus was clearly detected. This finding further indicates that WWP1 interacts with KLF5 in vivo.WWP1 Promotes KLF5 Protein Ubiquitination in Vivo—WWP1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which can ubiquitinate its substrate proteins. To test whether WWP1 ubiquitinates KLF5 protein, we cotransfected the Myc-WWP1 plasmid with the KLF5 expression construct into 22Rv1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the expression of WWP1 induced a smear of KLF5 proteins with higher molecular masses than wild-type KLF5 (57 kDa) with MG132 treatment, as determined by an anti-KLF5 Ab described previously (20Chen C. Sun X. Ran Q. Wilkinson K.D. Murphy T.J. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3319-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a FLAG-tagged control E3 ligase, FLAG-Parkin (26Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), or empty vector control did not induce KLF5 with higher molecular masses. We also co-transfected a HA-tagged ubiquitin expression construct with KLF5 and Myc-WWP1 plasmids. Expression of WWP1 not only induced a smear of KLF5 with higher molecular masses (left panel in Fig. 3B), it also significantly induced the ubiquitination of KLF5, as detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3B, right panel). These results indicate that WWP1 induces the ubiquitination of KLF5 in vivo.FIGURE 3WWP1 induces the ubiquitination of KLF5 protein in 22Rv1 cells. Presence of different expression plasmids or the treatment of MG132 (20 μm for 4 h) is indicated by + at the top, names for molecules are at the left, and molecular masses are at the right.

In the presence of ubiquitination reagents from an in vitro ubiquitin protein conjugation kit, in vitro translated KLF5 was effectively ubiquitinated (lane 2 in Fig. 4). Incubation of in vitro translated KLF5 protein with purified GST-fused wild-type WWP1 protein resulted in a significant increase in KLF5 ubiquitination (lane 4 in Fig. 4). In contrast, mutant GST-WWP1C886S suppressed KLF5 ubiquitination (lane 5 in Fig. 4). GST alone had no effect on KLF5 ubiquitination in vitro (lane 3 in Fig. 4). These results provide direct evidence that WWP1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for KLF5.FIGURE 4Ubiquitination of KLF5 by wild-type but not mutant WWP1 in an in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assay. Purified GST protein or GST-fused WWP1 proteins were incubated with in vitro translated KLF5 proteins labeled with 35S, and the reaction products were subjected to PAGE and autoradiography. input serves as a negative control.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W2038062533,"Algae have acquired plastids by developing an endosymbiotic relationship with either a cyanobacterium (primary endosymbiosis) or other eukaryotic algae (secondary endosymbiosis). We report a protist, which we tentatively refer to as Hatena, that hosts an endosymbiotic green algal partner but inherits it unevenly. The endosymbiosis causes drastic morphological changes to both the symbiont and the host cell architecture. This type of life cycle, in which endosymbiont integration has only partially converted the host from predator to autotroph, may represent an early stage of plastid acquisition through secondary symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2170040956,"DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are perhaps the most formidable lesion encountered by the cellular DNA repair machinery, and the elucidation of the process by which they are removed in eukaryotic cells has proved a daunting task. In particular, the early stages of adduct recognition and uncoupling of the cross-link have remained elusive principally because genetic studies have not been highly revealing. We have developed a biochemical assay in which processing of a DNA substrate containing a site-specific psoralen ICL can be monitored in vitro. Using this assay we have shown previously that the mismatch repair factor MutSβ, the nucleotide excision repair heterodimer Ercc1-Xpf, and the replication proteins RPA and PCNA are involved in an early stage of psoralen ICL processing. Here, we report the identification of two additional factors required in the ICL repair process, a previously characterized pre-mRNA splicing complex composed of Pso4/Prp19, Cdc5L, Plrg1, and Spf27 (Pso4 complex), and WRN the protein deficient in Werner syndrome. Analysis of the WRN protein indicates that its DNA helicase function, but not its exonuclease activity, is required for ICL processing in vitro. In addition, we show that WRN and the Pso4 complex interact through a direct physical association between WRN and Cdc5L. A putative model for uncoupling of ICLs in mammalian cells is presented. DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are perhaps the most formidable lesion encountered by the cellular DNA repair machinery, and the elucidation of the process by which they are removed in eukaryotic cells has proved a daunting task. In particular, the early stages of adduct recognition and uncoupling of the cross-link have remained elusive principally because genetic studies have not been highly revealing. We have developed a biochemical assay in which processing of a DNA substrate containing a site-specific psoralen ICL can be monitored in vitro. Using this assay we have shown previously that the mismatch repair factor MutSβ, the nucleotide excision repair heterodimer Ercc1-Xpf, and the replication proteins RPA and PCNA are involved in an early stage of psoralen ICL processing. Here, we report the identification of two additional factors required in the ICL repair process, a previously characterized pre-mRNA splicing complex composed of Pso4/Prp19, Cdc5L, Plrg1, and Spf27 (Pso4 complex), and WRN the protein deficient in Werner syndrome.

In addition, we show that WRN and the Pso4 complex interact through a direct physical association between WRN and Cdc5L. A putative model for uncoupling of ICLs in mammalian cells is presented. DNA interstrand cross-linking agents such as cyclophosamide and mitomycin C are widely used as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of a broad spectrum of cancers. The clinical usage of these drugs has fueled an interest in elucidating the mechanisms of repair of interstrand cross-links (ICLs) 2The abbreviations used are: ICLinterstrand cross-linkNERnucleotide excision repairRPAreplication protein APCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenWSWerner syndromesiRNAsmall interfering RNAGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseCRScross-link repair synthesis. that still remain largely unresolved in eukaryotic cells. In prokaryotes two mechanisms of repair of these lesions have been identified. A major error-free pathway involves incision by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway and a subsequent recombination gap filling step mediated by RecA (1Cole R.S. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1973; 46: 492PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cole R.S. Levitan D. Sinden R.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 39-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 3Sladek F.M. Munn M.M. Rupp W.D. Howard-Flanders P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6755-6765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A minor error-prone pathway also requires incision by NER, while the gap filling step is accomplished via translesion synthesis performed by DNA polymerase II (4Berardini M. Foster P.L. Loechler E.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2878-2882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Berardini M. Mackay W. Loechler E.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3506-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In each case the remaining monoadduct is removed by a second round of NER action. In budding yeast there appears to be a general conservation of these pathways in that a major mechanism involving NER and recombination has been identified (6Jachymczyk W.J. von Borstel R.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3259-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), as well as a pathway involving the translesion polymerase Rev3 whose primary importance appears to occur in nonreplicating cells (9McHugh P.J. Gill R.D. Waters R. Hartley J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3259-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In all eukaryotic cells examined double-strand breaks have been observed as intermediates of ICL repair (10Akkari Y.M. Bateman R.L. Reifsteck C.A. Olson S.B. Grompe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8283-8289Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11Dardalhon M. Averbeck D. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12De Silva I.U. McHugh P.J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3425-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) suggesting the possibility that recombination mechanisms may be required at more than one stage of this repair process. Mammalian cells have also been shown to employ two pathways of ICL repair. The minor pathway appears analogous to the Escherichia coli pathway in that it requires NER and presumably a translesion polymerase but not components of homologous recombination (14Wang X. Peterson C.A. Zheng H. Nairn R.S. Legerski R.J. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Zheng H. Wang X. Warren A.J. Legerski R.J. Nairn R.S. Hamilton J.W. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This pathway has also proved to be highly mutagenic in response to psoralen or mitomycin C adducts. The presumptive major pathway clearly requires homologous recombination, since mutations in genes such as XRCC1, XRCC2, and RAD51C result in severe sensitivity to ICL-inducing agents (16Liu N. Lamerdin J.E. Tebbs R.S. Schild D. Tucker J.D. Shen M.R. Brookman K.W. Siciliano M.J. Walter C.A. Fan W. Narayana L.S. Zhou Z.Q. Adamson A.W. Sorensen K.J. Chen D.J. Jones N.J. Thompson L.H. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mutants in the NER genes ERCC1 and XPF are also strikingly sensitive to these drugs; however, somewhat surprisingly other components of the NER pathway exhibit only mild sensitivity and have been shown not to be defective in the unhooking step of repair of nitrogen mustard ICLs in vivo (12De Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7980-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In general, cellular genetic studies have not been particularly revealing about the early stages of the major pathway of ICL repair in mammalian cells. Our prior biochemical studies have indicated a requirement for the mismatch repair factor MutSβ, the heterodimer Ercc1-Xpf, and replication protein A (RPA) in early recognition and uncoupling of psoralen ICLs (18Li L. Peterson C.A. Lu X. Wei P. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5619-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Zhang N. Lu X. Zhang X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4800-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the recognition step by MutSβ is stimulated by PCNA. Consistent with these biochemical findings, it has been shown that Msh2 and Ercc1-Xpf act cooperatively in human cells to remove cisplatin ICLs and that these proteins interact as determined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (22Lan L. Hayashi T. Rabeya R.M. Nakajima S. Kanno S. Takao M. Matsunaga T. Yoshino M. Ichikawa M. Riele H. Tsuchiya S. Tanaka K. Yasui A. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent findings in budding yeast have implicated a role for Msh2 and Exo I in repair of nitrogen mustard ICLs (23Barber L.J. Ward T.A. Hartley J.A. McHugh P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2297-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Taken together these findings suggest that mismatch repair factors and Ercc1-Xpf are involved in a novel pathway of ICL repair. interstrand cross-link nucleotide excision repair replication protein A proliferating cell nuclear antigen Werner syndrome small interfering RNA green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase cross-link repair synthesis. A number of genetic screens have been undertaken in budding yeast to identify novel genes involved in ICL repair. One isolated mutant, pso4-1, exhibited some sensitivity to irradiation but was particularly sensitive to psoralen and other ICL-inducing agents (24Henriques J.A. Vicente E.J. Leandro da Silva K.V. Schenberg A.C. Mutat. Res. 1989; 218: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Grey M. Dusterhoft A. Henriques J.A. Brendel M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4009-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was also shown to be defective in some forms of recombination such as gene conversion, crossing over, and intrachromosomal recombination. Cloning of PSO4 showed that it was allelic to PRP19, an essential component of the pre-mRNA spliceosome in both yeast and human cells (25Grey M. Dusterhoft A. Henriques J.A. Brendel M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5352-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, PRP19/PSO4 appears to play dual roles in the cell; it has an essential function in pre-mRNA splicing and a role in the processing of DNA lesions particularly ICLs. Interestingly, human Pso4/Prp19 has also been isolated from human cell extracts as a component of the nuclear matrix and termed NMP200 (31Gotzmann J. Gerner C. Meissner M. Holzmann K. Grimm R. Mikulits W. Sauermann G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The human protein has also been shown to interact with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and to be involved in mediating cell survival after DNA damage (32Mahajan K.N. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10746-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Pso4/Prp19 interacts with other components of the spliceosome and forms a highly stable core complex with a number of proteins including Cdc5L (Cef1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (28Ajuh P. Kuster B.

WRN is a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases and is mutated in the human autosomal recessive disease Werner syndrome (WS) (34Yu C.E. Oshima J. Fu Y.H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R.

This disease manifests a number of phenotypes including genetic instability, premature aging, and cancer predisposition (40Opresko P.L. Cheng W.H. von Kobbe C. Harrigan J.A. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). WRN possesses both a 3′ to 5′ helicase activity and a 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity in different domains of the protein (35Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M.

WRN has been shown to have a role in mediating cell survival and functioning in homologous recombination in response to DNA damage (41Prince P.R. Emond M.J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 42Saintigny Y. Makienko K. Swanson C. Emond M.J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Mol. Cell.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings WS cells have been shown to be hypersensitive to a number of DNA damaging agents and are particularly sensitive to ICL-inducing compounds (43Swanson C. Saintigny Y.

To investigate the mechanisms of ICL repair we have developed an in vitro assay in which repair processing in a plasmid substrate containing a site-specific psoralen cross-link can be monitored in mammalian cell extracts (18Li L. Peterson C.A. Lu X. Wei P. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5619-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Zhang N. Lu X. Zhang X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using this assay, we report here the fractionation and identification of a protein complex composed of Pso4/Prp19, Cdc5L, Plrg1, and Spf27 (Pso4 complex) that is required for processing of psoralen ICLs in vitro. In addition, we show that the WRN protein is also absolutely essential to this processing and that WRN interacts with the Pso4 complex mediated by a direct association with Cdc5L. Cell Culture—Human lymphoid cell lines were cultured in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium with 20% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells and HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% serum. Transfection of plasmids and siRNA were performed using FuGENE 6 and Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after the transfection and prepared for co-immunoprecipitation or colonogenesis assays. Recombinant Proteins and Antibodies— cDNAs for the Pso4 complex proteins were cloned into the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen) for expression in either E. coli, SF9 insect cells, or mammalian cells. The vectors expressing WRN proteins were generously provided by Judith Campisi. Recombinant 6×His-Cdc5L, 6×His-Plrg1, 6×His-Pso4, 6×His-Spf27, 6×His-WRN, 6×His-WRN(K84A), and 6×His-WRN-(1-333) were expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. Proteins were purified by nickel affinity and Mono Q chromatography. Polyclonal antibodies against Cdc5L, Plrg1, Pso4, and Spf27 were generously provided by Paul Ajuh (28Ajuh P. Kuster B. Panov K. Zomerdijk J.C. Mann M. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6569-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against Cdc5L was purchased from BD Biosciences. Monoclonal antibodies against GST and GFP are from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against WRN was purchased from Abcam and Sigma, respectively. Fractionation of HeLa Nuclear Extract and in Vitro Interstrand Cross-link Repair (CRS) Assay—HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (20Zhang N. Lu X. Legerski R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 47Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract was subjected to sequential chromatography using P11 phosphocellulose, hydroxyapatite, heparin-agarose, Mono S, and Mono Q. Active fractions were determined by reconstitution of the CRS assay with fractions FI and FII. The active fraction from the Mono Q column was applied to 12% SDS-PAGE, protein bands were visualized by silver staining, and isolated bands were subjected to mass spectrography analysis. Psoralen interstrand cross-linked substrates for the CRS assay were prepared as described previously (18Li L. Peterson C.A. Lu X. Wei P. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5619-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mammalian whole-cell extracts were prepared as described (48Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and were tested for competency in an in vitro NER assay (49Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The CRS assay was performed as described previously (18Li L. Peterson C.A. Lu X. Wei P. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5619-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Zhang N. Lu X. Zhang X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2388-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For reconstitution assays, 25 μg of HeLa nuclear extract, or 10 μg of fraction FI, 10 μg of fraction FII, and 2-4 μl of fraction FIII or the chromatographic fractions derived from FIII were used for each reaction. Immunodepletion, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Pull-down Assays—Immunodepletion and coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (50Zhang X. Succi J. Feng Z. Prithivirajsingh S. Story M.D. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9207-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For pull-down assays GST-tagged proteins were bound on glutathione-Sepharose beads according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The immobilized proteins were washed with Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), then nuclear extract or purified proteins was added to the beads and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. The unbound proteins were removed by washing the beads four times with 100 bed volumes of Nonidet P-40 buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and visualized after gel electrophoresis by immunoblot analysis. Colonogenic Survival Assay—Cdc5L and Pso4 were depleted by transfection of HeLa cells with siRNAs. The siRNA sequences used to knockdown Cdc5L and Pso4 were GGAAGAGAGGAGUUGAUUA and ACCACAGGCUGGCCUCAUU, respectively. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated at the indicated density. Twelve to 15 days later, colonies were fixed and stained with crystal violet (0.25% crystal violet, 0.2% paraformaldehyde, 72% methanol, 18% water) and counted. Reactivation Assay—Substrate preparation and the luciferase-based reactivation were performed as described previously (15Zheng H. Wang X. Warren A.J. Legerski R.J. Nairn R.S. Hamilton J.W. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Pso4 Complex Is Required for in Vitro Processing of ICLs—To elucidate the processing of ICLs in mammalian cells, we have developed an in vitro assay (referred to as CRS) in which a single psoralen ICL located at a defined site within a plasmid substrate induces DNA synthesis in both damaged and undamaged plasmids in cell-free extracts (18Li L. Peterson C.A. Lu X. Wei P. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5619-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The substrates for this assay are described in the legend to Fig. 1A. The donor template plasmid is added to the reactions primarily as a carrier to absorb nonspecific inhibitory DNA binding proteins. As shown previously (19Zhang N. Lu X. Zhang X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2388-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the products of the in vitro processing of psoralen ICLs are two oligonucleotides migrating at the positions of 113 and 86 nucleotides on denaturing gels, which are derived from uncoupling of the ICL (supplemental Fig. S1). To identify additional factors involved in the processing of ICLs, we have initiated fractionation of HeLa nuclear extracts. P11 phosphocellulose column chromatography of HeLa nuclear extracts yielded four fractions, FI-FIV, the first three of which are required to reconstitute the assay, while FIV is dispensable (Fig. 1B) (20Zhang N. Lu X. Legerski R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). RPA and PCNA can substitute for fraction FI, and Ercc1-Xpf and MutSβ are located in fraction FII but are not sufficient to substitute for this fraction (20Zhang N. Lu X. Legerski R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The factor(s) present in FIII were unknown, and thus we undertook the purification of these factor(s) using complementation of fractions FI and FII in the CRS assay. After five chromatographic steps (phosphocellulose, heparin, hydroxyapatite, Mono S, Mono Q) a single active fraction was obtained from the Mono Q column, and the bands detected by silver staining were processed for identification by mass spectroscopy (Fig. 1C). This analysis identified a complex containing the human homolog of the S. cerevisiae protein Pso4/Prp19 and three other proteins, the human homolog of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdc5 (Cdc5L), Plrg1, and Spf27 (Fig. 1D, upper panel). The identity of all four of these proteins was verified by Western blotting, and the Cdc5L and Pso4 results are shown (Fig. 1D, lower panel). All four of these proteins have been shown previously to be core components of a human Cdc5L-containing sub-pre-mRNA spliceosome complex that is conserved from yeast to mammals (28Ajuh P. Kuster B.

Interestingly, the only known catalytic domain in any of the four proteins is an ubiquitin E3 ligase located in the U-box domain of Pso4/Prp19 (54Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N.

Grillari J. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, two of the proteins, Pso4 and Plrg1, contain WD40 domains, all of which suggests that these proteins may play a largely structural role. For convenience, we will here designate these four proteins as the Pso4 complex. To verify the role of the Pso4 complex in ICL processing, we first immunodepleted Cdc5L from HeLa extracts (Fig. 2A) and then examined the activity of these depleted extracts in the CRS assay. As shown (Fig. 2B), depletion of Cdc5L resulted in a substantial reduction in the CRS assay. Furthermore, addition of purified recombinant Pso4 complex prepared from baculovirus (shown in Fig. 2C) was able to rescue the Cdc5L-depleted extracts. Next we examined various combinations of the recombinant Pso4 complex in the CRS assay. As shown (Fig. 2D, left panel), none of the individual proteins could substitute for FIII; however, addition of all four proteins did result in complementation approximately equivalent to that observed upon addition of FIII. In addition, no combination of any three of the proteins was able to effect complementation in the assay (Fig. 2D, right panel). Thus, we conclude that all four proteins are required for processing of psoralen ICLs in vitro and that the Pso4 complex is sufficient to substitute for fraction FIII in the CRS assay. Pso4 and Cdc5L Are Involved in Repair of ICLs in Vivo—To determine whether Pso4/Prp19 or Cdc5L is involved in mediating resistance to ICL-inducing agents in vivo, we used siRNA to deplete these proteins in HeLa cells. However, in contrast to a previous report (32Mahajan K.N. Mitchell B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10746-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) we found that transfection of duplex siRNA oligonucleotides targeting either PSO4 or CDC5L was growth inhibitory for HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S2), thus precluding cell survival studies after exposure to genotoxic agents. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but both of these factors are essential in yeast cells due to their role in pre-mRNA splicing, and this role appears to be conserved in mammalian cells (28Ajuh P.

We have shown in recent studies that wild-type mammalian cells are able to repair cross-linked plasmids upon transfection as determined by a luciferase reactivation assay (14Wang X. Peterson C.A.

Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We therefore used this short term assay after knockdown of Pso4 or Cdc5L by siRNA to examine the role of these factors in ICL repair in vivo. As shown (Fig. 3), depletion of either Pso4 or Cdc5L showed a substantial and highly reproducible reduction in the reactivation of psoralen cross-linked plasmids. These results were not due to differences in cellular transfection efficiency, since a GFP-expressing plasmid was included in each experiment to allow for normalization of the luciferase reactivation. The Pso4 Complex Associates with the Werner Syndrome Protein through a Direct Interaction with Cdc5L—To determine whether the Pso4 complex interacted with the previously identified components of in vitro ICL processing, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Antibodies to either Cdc5L or Pso4 were used for immunoprecipitation, and blots were subsequently analyzed for the presence of Msh2, Xpf, and the middle subunit of RPA; however, none of these proteins were detected (results not shown). Previous studies have shown that Werner syndrome cell lines are highly sensit"
https://openalex.org/W2169187896,"Although clinical and experimental studies have long suggested a role for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the regulation of erythropoiesis, the molecular basis of this role has not been well understood. We report here that transgenic mice carrying both the human renin and human angiotensinogen genes displayed persistent erythrocytosis as well as hypertension. To identify the receptor molecule responsible for this phenotype, we introduced both transgenes into the AT1a receptor null background and found that the hematocrit level in the compound mice was restored to the normal level. Angiotensin II has been shown to influence erythropoiesis by two means, up-regulation of erythropoietin levels and direct stimulation of erythroid progenitor cells. Thus, we conducted bone marrow transplantation experiments and clarified that AT1a receptors on bone marrow-derived cells were dispensable for RAS-dependent erythrocytosis. Plasma erythropoietin levels and kidney erythropoietin mRNA expression in the double transgenic mice were significantly increased compared with those of the wild-type control, while the elevated plasma erythropoietin levels were significantly attenuated in the compound mice. These results provide clear genetic evidence that activated RAS enhances erythropoiesis through the AT1a receptor of kidney cells and that this effect is mediated by the elevation of plasma erythropoietin levels in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2104622698,"Endotoxic shock, one of the most prominent causes of mortality in intensive care units, is characterized by pulmonary hypertension, systemic hypotension, heart failure, widespread endothelial activation/injury, and clotting culminating in disseminated intravascular coagulation and multi-organ system failure. In the last few years, studies in rodents have shown that administration of low concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) exerts potent therapeutic effects in a variety of diseases/disorders. In this study, we have administered CO (one our pretreatment at 250 ppm) in a clinically relevant, well-characterized model of LPS-induced acute lung injury in pigs. Pretreatment only with inhaled CO significantly ameliorated several of the acute pathological changes induced by endotoxic shock. In terms of lung physiology, CO pretreatment corrected the LPS-induced changes in resistance and compliance and improved the derangement in pulmonary gas exchange. In terms of coagulation and inflammation, CO reduced the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation and completely suppressed serum levels of the proinflammatory IL-1beta in response to LPS, while augmenting the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Moreover, the effects of CO blunted the deterioration of kidney and liver function, suggesting a beneficial effect in terms of end organ damage associated with endotoxic shock. Lastly, CO pretreatment prevents LPS-induced ICAM expression on lung endothelium and inhibits leukocyte marginalization on lung parenchyma."

Here we report the first mass spectral analysis of the RS domain of ASF/SF2, a prototypical SR protein. We found that SRPK1 was responsible for efficient phosphorylation of a short stretch of amino acids in the N-terminal portion of the RS domain of ASF/SF2 while Clk/Sty was able to transfer phosphate to all available serine residues in the RS domain, indicating that SR proteins may be phosphorylated by different kinases in a stepwise manner. Both kinases bind with high affinity and use fully processive catalytic mechanisms to achieve either restrictive or complete RS domain phosphorylation.

It is estimated that more than one-half of human genes are alternatively spliced (1Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Although many of these genes may contain only a few splice variants, a few have been shown to possess thousands (1Modrek B. Lee C. Nat.

RNA splicing occurs in the nucleus at a macromolecular complex composed of many RNA and protein molecules known as the spliceosome (4Akker S.A. Smith P.J. Chew S.L. J. Mol.

In the last decade it has become apparent that both the assembly of the spliceosome and selection of splice sites depend on the proper phosphorylation of a family of splicing factors known as SR proteins (1Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The SR proteins are so named because they have long stretches of arginineserine dipeptide repeats in RS domains. Phosphorylation leads to translocation of the SR protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (6Lai M.C. Lin R.I. Tarn W.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hypophosphorylation of these SR proteins promotes interaction with TAP suggesting that transport may require splicing factor dephosphorylation. These shuttling SR proteins were also found to play a direct role in translation in the cytoplasm (19Sanford J.R. Gray N.K. Beckmann K. Caceres J.F.

Although it is clear that SR proteins can be polyphosphorylated in the RS domain regions by the SRPK and Clk/Sty families of protein kinases (7Koizumi J. Okamoto Y. Onogi H. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4715-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the specificity and mechanism of SR protein phosphorylation by these kinases is still poorly understood. In previous investigations, we showed that SRPK and Clk/Sty have distinct substrate specificity and enzymatic kinetics in phosphorylating SR proteins (9Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated that SRPK1 uses a fully processive catalytic mechanism to phosphorylate the prototypical SR protein ASF/SF2 (21Aubol B.E. Chakrabarti S. Ngo J. Shaffer J. Nolen B. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This finding is interesting, because it indicates that SRPK1 makes a single encounter with ASF/SF2 and catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the RS domain without dissociating from the substrate. This unusual mechanism is prompted, in part, by a high affinity interaction between the enzyme and splicing factor (Kd ∼ 50 nm) (21Aubol B.E. Chakrabarti S. Ngo J. Shaffer J. Nolen B. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Once the SRPK1-ASF/SF2 complex is formed it dissociates very slowly in comparison to a fast forward rate for RS domain phosphorylation. Although a fully processive mechanism for serine phosphorylation is unique, it has been shown that the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues can occur in a similar manner. For instance, the tyrosine kinase Src phosphorylates Cas at numerous sites using a processive mechanism where no phosphotyrosine intermediates are released prior to complete phosphorylation of the substrate (22Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28190-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this case, it is thought that the SH2 domain of Src serves as a molecular tether for multiple rounds of tyrosine phosphorylation in the substrate, thereby, accounting for the absence of intermediate phosphoforms. In contrast, SRPK1 appears to use a unique docking site to anchor SR protein substrates near the catalytic site (23Ngo J. Chakrabarti S. Ding J-H. Velazquez-Dones A. Nolen B. Aubol B.E. Adams J.A. Fu X.-D. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this present study mass spectrometric and kinetic methods were used to determine how the SRPK and Clk/Sty families of protein kinases modify sequences in the RS domain of ASF/SF2. The results reveal that the RS domain in ASF/SF2 is not a random sequence with Arg-Ser repeats as the only recognizable feature. Instead, the RS domain can be divided into two subdomains, one of which was efficiently phosphorylated by SRPK1. In contrast, Clk/Sty was capable of transferring phosphate to all available serines in the RS domain. The phosphorylation of these subdomains appears to occur through similar catalytic mechanisms. Both SRPK1 and Clk/Sty can phosphorylate the RS domain using fully processive mechanisms. Interestingly, SRPK1 phosphorylates only the N-terminal portion of the RS domain before dissociating, whereas Clk/Sty can stay attached and phosphorylate the entire RS domain. Materials—ATP, MOPS, MES, MgCl2, KCl, NaCl, acetic acid, sucrose, Kodak imaging film (Biomax MR), trifluoroacetic acid, bovine serum albumin, acetonitrile, and liquid scintillant were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Glutathione immobilized on 4% beaded agarose and free glutathione were purchased from Sigma. Precast 10% PAGE gels were obtained from Bio-Rad, and [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was obtained from Aldrich Chemicals and recrystallized once from ethanol. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Construction of pET19b-ASF/SF2 containing the ASF/SF2 coding sequence with a His10 tag at the N terminus was constructed by inserting the PCR products of this gene in-frame into the NdeI and BamH1 sites of pET19b vector for expressing in Escherichia coli. The ASF/SF2 quadruple mutant (R210K/R218K/R229K/R240K) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with pET19b-ASF wild-type construct as template. The plasmids for SRPK1 and Clk/Sty were described previously (24Colwill K. Feng L.L. Yeakley J.M. Gish G.D. Caceres J.F. Pawson T. Fu X.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24569-24575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A kinase-inactive form of SRPK1 (kdSRPK1) was generated by replacing Lys at position 109 with Met and was previously described (25Yeakley J.M. Tronchere H. Olesen J. Dyck J.A. Wang H.Y. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A kinase-inactive form of Clk/Sty (kdClk/Sty) was constructed by replacing Lys at position 190 with Met. The plasmids for wild-type and mutant forms of His-tagged ASF/SF2 were transformed into the BL21(RIL) E. coli strain, and the cells were then grown at 37 °C in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 5 h. Cells were then pelleted and lysed by French Press using 10 ml of lysis buffer (0.1 m MOPS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The insoluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, washed twice with lysis buffer containing 2 m urea, and then resuspended in denaturing buffer (lysis buffer containing 8 m urea) for 30 min at room temperature. The soluble fraction, collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, was applied to a 1.5-ml Ni2+-Sepharose column and washed with denaturing buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The protein was re-folded by passing decreasing concentrations of urea through the column (8, 6, 4, 2, 1, and 0 m urea). The re-folded protein was eluted with 40 ml of elution buffer (0.1 m MOPS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol, pH 3.0). The pH of the eluted protein was changed to 7.0 by using NaOH. Clk/Sty was expressed from a pRSETA plasmid construct in E. coli BL21-DE3 pLysS and induced with 0.8 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at room temperature. Cells were lysed by French Press in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.8), 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Imidazole, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a Ni2+-Sepharose column, washed thoroughly with the same buffer containing 40 mm imidazole, and eluted with 300 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.8), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, concentrated to 1 ml with Amicon 30-kDa MWCO spin columns, loaded onto a 2-ml Q-column by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) in the same buffer, and eluted within a shallow NaCl gradient. A single peak was collected, dialyzed against 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.6), 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and stored at -80 °C. SRPK1 was purified using a previously published procedure (21Aubol B.E. Chakrabarti S. Ngo J. Shaffer J. Nolen B. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation Reactions—The phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 by SRPK1 and Clk/Sty was carried out according to previously published procedures in the presence of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 10 mm free Mg2+, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and [γ-32P]ATP (600-1000 cpm pmol-1) at 23 °C unless otherwise stated. Reactions were initiated with the addition of [32P]ATP (250 μm) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl and then were quenched with 10 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. A portion of each quenched reaction (20 μl) was loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Dried gels were then exposed with Kodak imaging film (Biomax MR), and protein bands corresponding to phosphorylated ASF/SF2 were excised and counted on the 32P channel in liquid scintillant. Control experiments, specific activity determination, and time-dependent product concentrations were determined as previously described (21Aubol B.E. Chakrabarti S. Ngo J. Shaffer J. Nolen B. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometric Analyses—MALDI-TOF analyses were carried out using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE PRO spectrometer. Preparation of phosphorylated protein samples were typically carried out using SRPK1 (5 and 10 μm) and ASF/SF2 (5 and 10 μm) in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm free Mg2+, 1 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature. Reactions were initiated with the addition of 3 mm ATP in a total volume of 40 μl. Reactions then were quenched with 3 volumes of 8 m urea, desalted with Zip-tip C18, and eluted with 80% acetonitrile, 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid for MALDI-TOF analysis. Unphosphorylated sample controls were prepared in the same manner except ATP was omitted. The matrix solution consisted of 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 1:1:1 acetonitrile, ethanol, 0.52% trifluoroacetic acid. Final pH of the matrix solution was 2.0. LysC digestion of wild-type ASF/SF2 was carried out in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 1 mm EDTA. For the quadruple mutant of ASF/SF2, 0.01% SDS was added to the digestion buffer. All proteolysis reactions were allowed to progress for 18 h at 37 °C. In some cases, guanidine hydrochloride (3 m) was added to the digested samples prior to mass spectral analyses. The samples were then processed in the same manner as wild-type ASF/SF2. Data Analysis—Progress curve data for ASF/SF2 phosphorylation were plotted as a ratio of incorporated phosphate and the total substrate concentration as a function of time and were fit to either a single- or double-exponential function unless otherwise stated. In the latter case, the amplitude of the first phase (α1) represents the fraction of sites phosphorylated in the enzyme-substrate complex. The fraction of bound substrate was then calculated from the ratio of α1 and the total amplitude (αtot) (Fraction bound = α1/αtot). The dissociation constant for the enzyme-substrate complex (Kd) was determined by plotting the fraction bound as a function of [E]o and fitting the curve to Equation 1, a+b BF=Kd+[S]o+[E]o−(Kd+[S]o+[E]o)2−4[S]o[E]o2[S]o where BF is the fraction bound, and [S]o and [E]o are the total concentrations of ASF/SF2 and SRPK1. Experiments were typically performed using fixed [S]o and varying [E]o. Phosphorylation Kinetics of ASF/SF2 by SRPK1 and Clk/Sty—The phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 by multiple kinases was evaluated by excising 32P-labeled bands from SDS-PAGE gels corresponding to the phosphorylated forms of the substrate. The SRPK1 reaction is accompanied by a time-dependent increase in band intensity for ASF/SF2 as previously described (21Aubol B.E. Chakrabarti S. Ngo J. Shaffer J. Nolen B. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The Clk/Sty reaction is accompanied by both an increase in band intensity and a small change in migration state of ASF/SF2 on the gel as described previously (26Prasad J. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4139-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Data in Fig. 1A show that both SRPK1 and Clk/Sty catalyze rapid ASF/SF2 phosphorylation in single turnover experiments ([E] > [ASF/SF2]). Although SRPK1 could only phosphorylate ∼8-10 sites as previously shown (21Aubol B.E. Chakrabarti S. Ngo J. Shaffer J. Nolen B. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1994; 91: 10824-10828Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), Clk/Sty was able to modify ∼20 sites, a value reflecting all available serines in the RS domain of ASF/SF2. Because this radioactive incorporation assay requires precise determinations of substrate concentration, we used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to obtain substrate-independent measurements of phosphoryl content. Fig. 1 (B and C) displays the spectra of ASF/SF2 with SRPK and Clk/Sty before and after treatment with ATP. The M+1 peak for ASF/SF2 increases to a higher mass/charge in the presence of both kinases consistent with ATP-dependent phosphorylation. For SRPK1, an increase of 845 mass units was observed, consistent with the incorporation of ∼10 phosphates per substrate molecule (Fig. 1B). In contrast, Clk/Sty treatment resulted in a large mass shift (1720 mass units), consistent with the incorporation of ∼22 phosphates (Fig. 1C). Dissociation Constants of SRPK1 and Clk/Sty—Because SRPK1 and Clk/Sty exhibit differential phosphorylation patterns, we sought to determine whether this unique specificity is linked to the stabilities of the enzyme-substrate complexes. To determine the affinities of both kinases for ASF/SF2, single turnover profiles were monitored as a function of total enzyme concentration. For both kinases, the phosphorylation kinetics of ASF/SF2 is biphasic at lower enzyme concentrations (Fig. 1, D and E), a phenomenon observed previously for SRPK1 (21Aubol B.E. Chakrabarti S. Ngo J. Shaffer J. Nolen B. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All progress curves approach a common end point defined by the total number of phosphorylation sites accessible by the kinase. In contrast, the kinetic profiles approximate single exponential transients that quickly reach an end point at high SRPK1 and Clk/Sty concentrations (>500 nm). The rate constants for the fast phases are similar in value and do not vary significantly over a wide range of enzyme concentrations (∼1-2 min-1). The amplitude of the first phase is used as an estimate of the initial concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, and its enzyme dependence can then be used to determine the Kd values for both SRPK1 and Clk/Sty (Fig. 1F). Fitting the normalized amplitude data to Equation 1 provides Kd values of 80 and 160 nm for SRPK1 and Clk/Sty. Mapping the SRPK1 Phosphorylation Sites in ASF/SF2 by MALDI-TOF—Because SRPK1, unlike Clk/Sty, phosphorylates only a subset of serine residues in the RS domain of ASF/SF2, we mapped the phosphorylation sites by MALDI-TOF using LysC-catalyzed proteolysis. This endoproteinase cuts specifically after lysine residues and, thus, is expected to produce ten fragments in ASF/SF2. Eight of these fragments are readily identified in the mass spectra, and four are displayed in Fig. 2 (A and B, -ATP). When ASF/SF2 is phosphorylated by SRPK1 (Fig. 2A, +ATP), a fragment (peptide 10) corresponding to the complete RS domain is absent, and no phosphorylated forms at higher molecular weight are detected. The disappearance of this fragment is likely due to poor flight of the phosphopeptide in the instrument (even after treatment with guanidine hydrochloride, see below), which is a widely known phenomenon in analyzing phosphopeptides by mass spectrometry (28Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, the peaks corresponding to peptides outside the RS domain are unaffected by ATP treatment. A similar phenomenon is also observed when ASF/SF2 is phosphorylated by Clk/Sty and subjected to LysC proteolysis (Fig. 2B). Only the peak corresponding to the full RS domain disappears. These data indicate that both Clk/Sty and SRPK1 do not phosphorylate residues outside the RS domain. Traditional protease mapping approaches to identify the subset of residues modified by kinases are not readily applicable here owing to the extensive arginine-serine dipeptide redundancy in the RS domain. To overcome this problem, four lysine mutations were introduced into the RS domain (R210K/R218K/R229K/R240K) to disrupt the arginine-serine repeat region and facilitate specific fragmentation of this domain by LysC, which was expected to generate five additional, unique peptide fragments in the MALDI-TOF spectrum (fragments 10a-e at the top of Fig. 3). In separate kinetic and mass spectrometric studies, we showed that SRPK1 phosphorylated the quadruple mutant to the same phosphoryl content and by the same mechanism as wild-type ASF/SF2 (data not shown). Upon phosphorylation of the quadruple mutant by SRPK1, two of the five fragments (10d and 10e) were unaffected while the remainder (10a-c) disappeared (Fig. 3A). To improve the flight of these fragments, guanidine hydrochloride (3 m) was added after LysC digestion to enhance detection (Fig. 3, B-D). For peptides 10a and 10c, new fragments were detected upon ATP treatment, which corresponded to the molecular weights of triple-phosphorylated peptides (Fig. 3, B and C). For peptide 10b, a peak corresponding to the quadruple-phosphorylated peptide was detected (Fig. 3D). Overall, 10 phosphates on these fragments were detected, a value consistent with the total phosphoryl content of the untreated quadruple mutant based on MALDI-TOF measurements (spectra not shown). These results, coupled with the absence of phosphorylation in peptides 10d and 10e, demonstrate that SRPK1 catalyzes site-specific phosphorylation in the N-terminal portion of the RS domain in ASF/SF2. Based on the position of serines within the peptide fragments, we conclude that SRPK1 modifies sites between residues 199 and 227. Stepwise Phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 By SRPK1 and Clk/Sty—The finding that SRPK1 and Clk/Sty differentially phosphorylate the RS domain in ASF/SF2 raises an interesting question as to whether these two kinases could act synergistically on the same substrate. In light of our previous finding that SRPK1 and Clk/Sty could each form stable complexes with ASF/SF2, we asked whether Clk/Sty could still catalyze phosphorylation in the presence of SRPK1. These experiments were performed using equal concentrations of both Clk/Sty and SRPK1 so that either kinase can effectively compete with the other for ASF/SF2 if a common binding site is used. As shown in Fig. 4A, after pre-phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 with SRPK1, an equivalent amount of Clk/Sty was added (300 nm) and found to phosphorylate the remaining sites in the RS domain. In contrast, the addition of an equivalent amount of SRPK1 (300 nm) after prephosphorylation with Clk/Sty led to no significant increase in phosphoryl content (Fig. 4B). Thus, prephosphorylation of ASF/SF2 by SRPK1 does not impair further phosphorylation by Clk/Sty when equivalent amounts of enzyme are used. To determine whether or not the binding of one kinase could antagonize the other at higher concentrations, inhibition studies were performed using excess amounts of an inactive version of SRPK1 (kdSRPK1) that contains a Lys to Met mutation in the ATP binding site. Using a 50-fold molar excess of kdSRPK1 (50 μm), the phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 by Clk/Sty (1 μm) was effectively reduced to a small background reaction, consistent with the trapping of about 98% of the total substrate. The initial velocities for ASF/SF2 phosphorylation are 50 and 1.3 sites/min in the absence and presence of kdSRPK1. Overall, these findings suggest that SRPK1 antagonizes the action of Clk/Sty when present at high concentrations but allows complete and rapid phosphorylation of the RS domain when the enzyme concentrations are equivalent. Processive Phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 by SRPK1—We showed previously that SRPK1 catalyzes ASF/SF2 phosphorylation in a processive manner in a pre-formed enzyme-substrate complex (21Aubol B.E. Chakrabarti S. Ngo J. Shaffer J. Nolen B. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To extend this analysis to a more natural kinase-substrate system, we determined whether processive phosphorylation is a result of the method of complex preparation. To perform these studies, we combined native SRPK1 and ASF/SF2 without a re-folding step and determined whether this complex could be processively phosphorylated in start-trap experiments. In this experiment, the reaction is initiated with ATP (start) and simultaneously mixed with excess kdSRPK1 (trap). The experiment is performed under single turnover conditions where the SRPK1 concentration (1 μm) is ∼12-fold above the Kd for the complex ensuring that very little free ASF/SF2 is present at the time of start. If any phosphorylated forms of ASF/SF2 are generated and released from SRPK1 as expected in a distributive mechanism, kdSRPK1 will trap them and inhibit the reaction. However, if the reaction is processive, kdSRPK1 will not influence the progress curve. As shown in Fig. 5A, kdSRPK1 does not impact the phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 when added at the time of start in keeping with a processive reaction. In comparison, addition of kdSRPK1 to the complex prior to start with ATP leads to profound inhibition of the reaction progress curve indicating that kdSRPK1 is an effective trap for ASF/SF2. These data indicate that SRPK1 naturally catalyzes processive phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 in solution. Clk/Sty Catalyzes Processive Phosphorylation of the Entire RS Domain—Because Clk/Sty phosphorylates ASF/SF2 to a greater extent than SRPK1, we wondered whether the complete modification of the RS domain could occur in a fully processive manner. To test for this possibility, we performed start-trap experiments using excess amounts of a kinase inactive form of Clk/Sty (kdClk/Sty) as a trapping agent for the detection of any free ASF/SF2. As shown in Fig. 5B, when added at reaction start, kdClk/Sty did not affect the reaction rate or end point for the Clk/Sty-catalyzed reaction. The efficiency of the trap was verified by demonstrating that kdClk/Sty could effectively inhibit the reaction when added to the complex prior to start. The initial velocity of the progress curve is lowered from 40 sites/min in the absence of kdClk/Sty to 1.1 sites/min in the presence of pre-equilibrated kdClk/Sty, a rate change corresponding to a trapping efficiency of 97%. These findings indicate that the absence of inhibition in the start-trap experiment is not the result of poor binding of the inactive kinase trap. Overall, these findings suggest that Clk/Sty is capable of processively phosphorylating the entire RS domain. Sequential Phosphorylation of RS Domain Segments By Clk/Sty—To determine whether Clk/Sty could sequentially phosphorylate portions of the RS domain, we analyzed the gel shift associated with ASF/SF2 phosphorylation. Unlike the SRPK1 reaction, the phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 by Clk/Sty occurs with a detectable gel shift in the phosphorylated species (inset to Fig. 6). A fast migrating species (lower) is populated early in the progress curve (∼0.3 min) followed by the production of a slower migrating species (upper). The appearance and disappearance of the lower band were fitted to Equation 2, a+b L=Lmax×k1(k2−k1)[exp(−k1×t)−exp(−k2×t)] where L is the concentration of incorporated 32P normalized to the total ASF/SF2 concentration at any time t, Lmax is the maximum phosphoryl content of the lower band, and k1 and k2 are the rate constants controlling the production and disappearance of the lower band. The time dependence for the generation of the upper band was fitted to Equation 3, a+b U=Umax×1−k2exp(−k1×t)−k1exp(−k2×t)(k2−k1) where U is the concentration of incorporated 32P normalized to the total concentration of ASF/SF2 at any time t, Umax is the phosphoryl content of the upper band, and k1 and k2 are defined as in Equation 2. Equations 2 and 3 are adapted from a previous study (29Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences: Receptors, Transmitters and Catalysts. 1995; (pp., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge): 111-112Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the appearance of the lower and upper bands follow a classic sequential reaction pattern where the lower (hypophosphorylated) species forms rapidly (3-6 min-1) and then disappears at the same rate constant as the formation of the upper (hyperphosphorylated) species (∼1 min-1). The total incorporation of 32P into both bands (dotted line in Fig. 6) approximates a single exponential relationship (1.5 min-1) as observed previously under similar reaction conditions (Fig. 1E). The rapid production of the lower band and the lag in the generation of the upper band is consistent with the sequential phosphorylation of two regions in the RS domain of ASF/SF2. Finally, it is worth noting that this sequential determination implies an ordered succession of phosphorylation events but does not refer to whether this occurs in a processive or distributive manner. Rather, processivity is established in start-trap experiments and is independent of reaction sequence determination (Fig. 5). In the present study, we characterized representatives of two major kinase families involved in post-translational modification of SR proteins. Enzyme-dependent single turnover data show that both kinases bind with similar affinities to ASF/SF2 (Fig. 1). By mass spectrometric mapping, we found, for the first time, that Clk/Sty is able to transfer phosphates to the majority of serine residues in the RS domain, whereas SRPK1 is highly restricted to a block of arginine/serine (RS) repeats in the N-terminal half of the RS domain, demonstrating clear regiospecificity between the two kinases (Figs. 2 and 3). The observation is consistent with previous phosphopeptide mapping, showing that the RS domain phosphorylated by Clk/Sty appears to give rise to a much more complicated phosphopeptide pattern than that by SRPK1 (9Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). These findings can now be used to explain some unexpected reactivities of SR proteins from other species. For example, the Drosophila ASF/SF2 ortholog dASF was shown to be a substrate for Clk/Sty, but not for SRPK1 (30Allemand E. Gattoni R. Bourbon H.M. Stevenin J. Caceres J.F. Soret J. Tazi J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1345-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons reveal that the first block of RS repeats in ASF/SF2 that are phosphorylated by SRPK1 is substituted with a glycine-tract in dASF, thereby, abolishing the SRPK1 sites but still preserving the Clk/Sty sites. The relaxed specificity of Clk/Sty-mediated phosphorylation indicates that this family of kinases may play a broad regulatory role in RNA metabolism in mammalian cells. Partial Phosphorylation of the RS Domain By SRPK1—Although SRPK1 phosphorylates up to ten serines in the N-terminal portion of the RS domain, the kinetic transient associated with this modification is monophasic at high enzyme concentration. This raises the compelling question of how SRPK1 accomplishes multisite phosphorylation over a confined polypeptide stretch without introducing complex multiphase kinetics. Two mechanisms can be invoked to account for this phenomenon. First, SRPK1 may not distinguish between these sites and consequently may phosphorylate them randomly in a tight complex with ASF/SF2. Such a mechanism would require considerable flexibility in the RS domain so that all sites are equally accessible to the kinase and, thus, kinetically indistinguishable. Second, SRPK1 may phosphorylate these residues in a sequential manner with the initial site representing the slow step in the overall reaction. In this mechanism, the RS domain may be more rigidly held in place so that SRPK1 starts at one locus and then phosphorylates in a single direction (either N- or C-terminal) until the entire block of residues is modified. The placement of a slow phosphorylation step early in the reaction cycle allows the overall reaction to appear monophasic, satisfying the observed single exponential kinetic traces at high enzyme concentrations (Figs. 1 and 5). At this time, it is difficult to ascertain which mechanism predominates, because it is unclear whether the SRPK1-catalyzed reaction has a defined directionality or is random. Nonetheless, given the electrostatic changes expected in the RS domain upon modification, it is more likely that phosphorylation would affect interaction of the RS domain with the active site of SRPK1 and, thus, give rise to more complex multiphase kinetic behavior. Given this potential limitation, we suspect that SRPK1 is most likely to catalyze sequential, processive phosphorylation with an initial, rate-limiting priming step. Modifying the Entire RS Domain without Enzyme Dissociation—Clk/Sty is not only capable of phosphorylating the entire RS domain of ASF/SF2, but it also accomplishes this feat using a fully processive pathway. Thus, Clk/Sty can remain attached to ASF/SF2 for a longer period of time, extending an otherwise regiospecific reaction and including all blocks of Arg-Ser repeats. Although it is not clear at this time whether either Clk/Sty or SRPK1 uses a preferred directionality for this modification, time-dependent gel shift assays suggest that regions of the RS domain are phosphorylated in sequential manners. For Clk/Sty an early phospho-intermediate is populated in the active site before conversion to the fully phosphorylated form. This early form is generated at a faster rate than the fully mature species, thus, establishing two identifiable blocks of Clk/Sty modification. Interestingly, Clk/Sty is capable of switching between these two phosphorylation blocks without dissociating from the SR protein. Cellular Control of Phosphorylation Specificity—The current data indicate that Clk/Sty and SRPK1 can phosphorylate SR proteins sequentially but not simultaneously. Although Clk/Sty modifies additional residues in ASF/SF2 in the presence of equal amounts of SRPK1, an imbalance in the SRPK1 concentration can inhibit phosphorylation of the RS domain, because one kinase antagonizes the action of the other (Fig. 4). The cell avoids this potential conflict by anchoring the SRPK family of kinases in the cytoplasm (31Wang H.Y. Lin W. Dyck J.A. Yeakley J.M. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and restricting the Clk/Sty family of kinases to the nucleus (9Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the spatial control of SRPKs is achieved via a spacer within the conserved kinase core. Deletion of this spacer has little effect on the kinase activity but results in a quantitative shift of the kinase to the nucleus. 7J.-H. Ding, X.-Y. Zhong, J. C. Hagopian, B. E. Aubol, J. R. Feramisco, G. Ghosh, H.-L. Zhou, J. A. Adams, and X.-D. Fu (2005), submitted for publication. These and other findings (9Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I.

Colwill K. Pawson T. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6991-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) are consistent with a model in which the SRPK family is largely involved in SR protein import into the nucleus, whereas nuclear-anchored Clk/Sty serves as a mediator for SR protein utilization in the nucleus. Unlike SRPK1, Clk/Sty has much broader substrate specificity so the full potential of this enzyme family in splicing control is likely to be more complex. The methods outlined in this report to accurately assess phosphoryl content, regiospecificity of modification, and kinetic pathways are important for understanding the role of these SR proteins and their regulatory kinases in splicing regulation."

Two of these proteins, c-Myc and cyclin E, are recognized by the Cdc4 E3 ligase of the Skp1/Cul1/Rbx1 (SCF) complex.

Pin1 binds to the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex in a manner that depends on Ser384 of cyclin E, which is phosphorylated by Cdk2. The absence of Pin1 results in an increased steady-state level of cyclin E and stalling of the cells in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle.

Mitogenic stimuli initiate a sequence of events that result in the entry of quiescent cells into S phase (1McGowan C.H. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). Critical for this important transition is the ordered synthesis and degradation of transcription factors such as c-Jun and c-Myc (Myc) and cyclins such as cyclin D and cyclin E (1McGowan C.H. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). Deregulation of the turnover of these proteins, such that they remain active at inappropriate times during cell cycle progression, is frequently found in human cancer. Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate protein turnover is crucial to provide insight into the oncogenic process. Three proteins important for the progression of cells into S phase, c-Jun, c-Myc, and cyclin E, are ubiquitylated by a common member of the Skp1/Cul1/Rbx1 (SCF) 3The abbreviations used are: SCFSkp1/Cul1/Rbx1MEFmouse embryo fibroblastGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridineWTwild typeMMTVmurine mammary tumor virus. group of ubiquitin enzymes in which the F-box component, which serves as the ubiquitin E3 ligase, is Cdc4 (SEL-10, Fbw7, Ago) (2Nakayama K.I.

The Cdc4 phosphodegron of Myc is present in a domain termed Myc box 1 (MB1), containing the sequence LPpTP-PLpSP (where pT represents phosphothreonine and pS represents phosphoserine), in which the two phosphorylation events occur sequentially and are catalyzed by ERK (Ser62) and GSK3β (Thr58), respectively (6Welcker M. Orian A. Jin J. Grim J.A. Harper J.W. Eisenman R.N. Clurman B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9085-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 7Yada M. Hatakeyama S. Kamura T.

Pin1 binds to the doubly phosphorylated motif in a manner requiring phospho-Thr58 and promotes a conformational change that presents phospho-Ser62 as a substrate for the protein phosphatase PP2A (5Yeh E.

Regardless of the precise mechanism involved, inhibition of PP2A or the absence of Pin1 results in a stabilization of Myc (5Yeh E. Cunningham M. Arnold H. Chasse D. Monteith T. Ivaldi G. Hahn W.C.

Myc can also be stabilized by mutating Thr58 to Ala, and this mutation renders Myc oncogenic in a primary human cell transformation assay (5Yeh E. Cunningham M. Arnold H. Chasse D. Monteith T.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4800-4809Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), yet the precise mechanism responsible for ensuring the timely cell cycle-dependent turnover of cyclin E is incompletely understood. For these reasons and because of the similarities in the phosphodegron motif and degradation process between Myc and cyclin E, we investigated whether cyclin E was also a Pin1-binding protein. Here we show that Pin1 binds cyclin E and modulates cyclin E levels. In the absence of Pin1, cyclin E is deregulated in a way that leads to its stabilization, which, in combination with other protein alterations in Pin1 null cells, leads to cell cycle defects. We also demonstrate a correlation between the cell cycle defects that occur in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) null for Pin1 and increased rate in the progression of genomic instability when these cells are immortalized by inactivating p53 function. Finally, we show that the cell cycle defects resulting from the loss of Pin1 sensitize immortalized Pin1 null cells to more extensive and aggressive transformation and tumorigenesis induced by the Ras oncogene. Cells and Cell Culture—HEK 293 cells were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection. 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Phoenix cells (293 derivative) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Pin1 null mice, originally generated by Fujimori et al. (28Fujimori F. Takahashi K. Uchida C. Uchida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), were obtained from Hoffmann-LaRoche. The pin1 gene deletion was transferred into an isogenic C57BL6 background using marker-assisted speed congenic breeding by Jackson Laboratory. pin1+/+ and pin1–/– embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from the isogenic C57BL6 strain as previously described (29Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). MEFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing sodium pyruvate and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. 293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) serum-reduced media per the manufacturer's suggestion. Cells were plated 1 day prior to transfection at a density of ∼1 × 106 cells/100-mm plate. Briefly, 2.5 μg of DNA was mixed with 15–30 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine, respectively, in 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The mixture was added to the cells for 12–18 h prior to treatment with drug or lysis. The following plasmids were used for transfections. pCS2-Myc-cyclin E, cyclin ET62A, cyclin ET62A/T380A, cyclin ES372A, and cyclin ES384A were generous gifts from J. Wade Harper (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). pBabe-Puro-Ras was kindly provided by Chris Counter (Duke University, Durham, NC), and pBabe-Hygro-p53DD was from William Hahn (Dana Farber Research Institute, Boston, MA). pWZL-Blast-Myc was generated as previously described (5Yeh E. Cunningham M. Arnold H. Chasse D. Monteith T. Ivaldi G. Hahn W.C. Stukenberg P.T. Shenolikar S. Uchida T. Counter C.M. Nevins J.R. Means A.R. Sears R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Protein Binding Assays—GST pull-down assays were performed as previously described (5Yeh E. Cunningham M. Arnold H. Chasse D. Monteith T. Ivaldi G. Hahn W.C. Stukenberg P.T. Shenolikar S. Uchida T. Counter C.M. Nevins J.R. Means A.R. Sears R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST and GST-Pin1 fusion proteins with either wild type Xenopus Pin1, an xPin1 WW domain mutant with substitutions at W11A and W34A, or a xPin1 catalysis-deficient mutant with a substitution at C109A was prepared as described (30Winkler K.E. Swenson K.I. Kornbluth S. Means A.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The GST and GST-Pin1 recombinant proteins were maintained on GSH-agarose beads and stored at 4 °C. Cells were lysed in buffer containing PBS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science) and NaF. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation prior to binding assays. Binding was performed at 4 °C for 1 h using 10 μg of GST proteins incubated with 500 μg of total lysate protein. Beads were washed four times in 1 ml of lysis buffer per wash. Subsequently, proteins were solubilized in 2× SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. For immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science) and NaF. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation. 500 μg of total lysate protein was used per sample. Prior to binding, the lysate samples were precleared with Protein A/G-Sepharose for 10 min at 4 °C. Binding was performed using 2 μg (per sample) of anti-9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for Myc-tagged protein. For experiments using Xenopus interphase extracts, extracts were prepared as previously described (30Winkler K.E. Swenson K.I. Kornbluth S. Means A.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Binding was performed by preincubating anti-Pin1 to Protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of bovine serum albumin. The beads were washed three times in PBS prior to incubation with 400 μgof total extract protein. Beads were washed four times in a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. Bound proteins were separated and analyzed as described above. Western Blotting—The following antibodies were used for the detection of proteins by Western blotting: anti-Cdk2 M2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin E M20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin E HE12 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Myc 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Pin1 (30Winkler K.E. Swenson K.I. Kornbluth S. Means A.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), anti-p27 C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p53 FL-393 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphocyclin E Thr380 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-β-actin (Sigma). Equal amounts of protein for each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). Membranes were blocked in TBS-0.2% Tween 20 containing 5% milk for 1 h prior to incubation with primary antibody. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in the blocking solution with the exception of anti-Pin1, which was diluted 1:10,000 unless otherwise stated. Membranes were washed a minimum of three times in Tris-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20 for 15 min each wash. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted into the blocking buffer and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) per the manufacturer's instructions. Retroviral Transduction—The pin1+/+ and pin1–/– cells containing p53DD and Ras were generated by amphotrophic retroviral transduction and polyclonal selection using 10 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem) or 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Calbiochem). Viral medium was obtained by Lipofectamine transfection of the Phoenix packaging cell line with 10 μg of DNA. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h, after which time the medium was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (16Rajagopalan H. Jallepalli P.V. Rago C. Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Nature. 2004; 428: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) to remove any cellular debris. Filtered viral medium was supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) and added to primary MEFs at passage 3 for 24 h. Cells were allowed to recover in complete medium for 24 h at 37 °C prior to drug selection. Cellular Transformation—The ability of cells to undergo anchorage independent growth was tested as previously described (32Cifone M.A. Fidler I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). 5 × 104 cells were plated in 0.3% Nobel agar, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum on 35-mm plates containing a 2-mm grid. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 21 days and assessed for colony growth in soft agar. Cells were fed one time weekly with 1 ml of agar/medium mixture. Colonies were counted by light microscopy. The mean ± S.D. represents two independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Tumor Formation in Immunodeficient (SCID) Mice—SCID mice were obtained from Charles River and housed in the Comprehensive Cancer Center Isolation Facility under a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum, and all care was given in compliance with National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines on the use of laboratory and experimental animals. Prior to injection, cells were free of micoplasma, drugs, and antibiotics. Five mice were injected per cell type with a single subcutaneous injection of 1 × 107 cells/animal. Data are represented as number of mice that developed tumors over total number of animals. Real Time PCR—Quantitation of cellular mRNA levels was determined by real time PCR using the SyberGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) reagent per the manufacturer's suggestions. Briefly primers to the NH2-terminal region of cyclin E were created to contain the following sequences: 5′-ACG GAC CAC AGC AAC ATG AA-3′ and 5′-AAA CAC GGC CAC ATT TGC CT-3′ (IDT). Total cellular RNA was isolated by harvesting confluent 100-mm plates of pin1+/+ and pin1–/– MEFs using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent. Cells were harvested in 1 ml of TRIzol and cleaned with chloroform. Resulting material was purified by ethanol precipitation. First strand cDNA was generated using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reaction mixtures were denatured at 65 °C for 6 min followed by cDNA synthesis at 50 °C for 50 min, and then the reactions were terminated by incubation at 85 °C for 5 min. Resultant cDNA was mixed with designated primers and SyberGreen dye. The mixture was analyzed by real time PCR (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: step 1, 95 °C for 3 min; step 2, 60.8 °C for 0–15 min; step 3, 72 °C for 0–15 min; repeat steps 2 and 3 for 45 cycles; step 5, 72 °C for 2 min; step 6, 45 °C for 0–10 min. Samples were analyzed two times in duplicate per trial. Cell Proliferation—2.5 × 105 cells were seeded into 60-mm plates in duplicate. Every 24 h, cells were trypsinized and counted by Coulter counter. Data are represented as the average of the two samples for both cell types at each time point. These data are representative of five individual experiments. BrdUrd Incorporation—1 × 105 cells were seeded onto coverslips in 6-well plates and incubated overnight or until 70–80% confluent. Cells were pulsed with BrdUrd for 30 min at a final concentration of 10 μm. Following incubation with BrdUrd, cells were fixed in cold MeOH for 5 min at –20 °C and then rehydrated in PBS. 1 ml of 2 m HCl/Triton X-100 was added to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed once for 5 min in 1 ml of 0.1 m sodium tetraborate (pH 8.5) and twice for 5 min in PBS followed by blocking in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 30 min. To perform staining, anti-BrdUrd, diluted 1:100 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, was added to each coverslip and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Coverslips were washed three times in PBS for 5 min and then incubated with anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate diluted 1:200 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS and incubated at room temperature for 60 min followed by three washes in PBS. Coverslips were mounted on slides with fluor antioxidant containing 1:5000 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss-Axiscop). Each of three individual experiments were performed in triplicate, and ≥300 cells were counted per replicate. Flow Cytometry—MEFs were grown until ∼70–80% confluent in 60-mm plates. Cells were harvested by washing once in Hanks' balanced salt solution followed by trypsinization. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min and washed once in PBS, followed by fixation with cold 70% ethanol. At this time, cells were either stored at –20 °C until used or kept on ice for 2 h prior to staining. DNA staining was performed by resuspending cells in PBS containing propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) and RNase A (50 units) and then analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Duke University Comprehensive Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Shared Resource, Durham, NC). Three separate experiments were performed with each cell type analyzed in triplicate in each experiment. Pin1 Binds to the Cyclin E-Cdk2 Complex and Influences the Stability of Cyclin E Protein—Cyclin E has been reported to undergo phosphorylation on several Ser and Thr residues in cells (12Welcker M.

Three sites, Thr62, Thr380, and Ser384 (shown in black), influence the Cdc4-dependent turnover of cyclin E, whereas Ser372 (shown in gray) may be involved in cyclin E degradation but by an ill defined pathway (12Welcker M.

To determine whether endogenous Pin1 and cyclin E interact, we used Xenopus interphase extracts and immunoprecipitated Pin1 using our previously described anti-Xenopus Pin1 antibody (29Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, endogenous cyclin E and Pin1 do interact in this assay. Next, we transfected 293 cells with wild type (WT), Myc-tagged cyclin E and subjected the extracts to GST pull-down assays using GST alone, as a negative control, or GST-Pin1. As shown in the first two lanes of Fig. 1C, GST-Pin1 also binds Myc-tagged cyclin E. We next evaluated the importance of the three Cdc4-specific phosphorylation sites, Thr62, Thr380, and Ser384, in Pin1 binding by transfecting Myc-tagged cyclin E cDNA constructs that were mutated in one or more of the phosphorylation sites illustrated in Fig. 1A. Surprisingly, mutation of Thr62, Thr380, or the combination of Thr62 and Thr380 does not affect Pin1 binding (Fig. 1C, lanes 3–8). On the other hand, mutation of Ser384 nearly abolishes Pin1 binding (Fig. 1C, lanes 9 and 10). Since Ser384 is phosphorylated by the Cdk2 component of the cyclin E-Cdk2 heterodimer (12Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), this result suggested that Pin1 might bind to the heterodimer in a manner that requires an active Cdk2 protein to catalyze the phosphorylation of Ser384 on cyclin E. This hypothesis is supported by the data in Fig. 1, D–F. First, when Pin1 is associated with WT endogenous or Myc-tagged cyclin E, immunoblot analysis reveals the presence of both cyclin E and Cdk2 (Fig. 1, D and E, lanes 1 and 2, and F, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Second, preincubation of the cells containing Myc-cyclin E with the selective Cdk2 inhibitor roscovitine prior to lysis and the addition of GST-Pin1 markedly attenuated the binding of both cyclin E and Cdk2 (Fig. 1E, lanes 3 and 4). This result was repeated three times with similar results, and quantitation of these results can be found in supplemental Fig. 1. Although roscovitine i"
https://openalex.org/W2052658654,"The non-canonical pathway based on processing of NF-κB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 plays a critical role in controlling B cell function and lymphoid organogenesis. Activation of this unique pathway by extracellular stimuli requires NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and de novo protein synthesis. However, how NIK is regulated is largely unknown. Here, we systematically analyzed NIK expression at different levels in the presence or absence of different NF-κB stimuli. We found that NIK mRNA is relatively abundant and undergoes constitutive protein synthesis in resting B cells. However, NIK protein is undetectable. Interestingly, protein expression of NIK is steadily induced by B cell-activating factor or CD40 ligand, two major physiological inducers of p100 processing, but not by mitogen phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin or cytokine tumor necrosis factor α, two well known inducers of the canonical NF-κB signaling. Remarkably, both B cell-activating factor and CD40 ligand do not significantly induce expression of NIK at translational or transcriptional level but rather rescue the basally translated NIK protein from undergoing degradation. Furthermore, overexpressed or purified NIK protein triggers p100 processing in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor. Taken together, these studies define one important mechanism of NIK regulation and the central role of NIK stabilization in the induction of p100 processing. These studies also provide the first evidence explaining why activation of the non-canonical NF-κB signaling is delayed and can be inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitor as well as why most classical NF-κB stimuli, including mitogens and tumor necrosis factor α, fail to induce p100 processing.

NF-κB represents a collection of dimeric transcription factors that in mammals comprises five members: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 p50, and NF-κB2 p52 (1Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu.

Unlike the three Rel proteins, which are synthesized directly as mature proteins, p50 and p52 are generated by proteolytical processing from their large precursors, p105 and p100, respectively (4Fan C.M.

Interestingly, both p105 and p100 contain ankyrin repeats at their C-terminal regions and function as IκB-like inhibitors of NF-κB (6Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Whereas the IκB degradation and p100 processing are inducible, the processing of p105 is constitutive (8Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are two major pathways leading to induction of NF-κB activation: the IκB degradation (canonical) and p100 processing (non-canonical) pathways (10Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3294) Google Scholar). The canonical NF-κB pathway is required for fundamental functions of various cells and can be rapidly and transiently activated by a plethora of substances such as mitogens, cytokines, and microbial components (11Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3448) Google Scholar). These stimuli ultimately lead to activation of a specific IκB kinase (IKK) 3The abbreviations used are: IKKIκB kinaseBAFFB cell-activating factorβ-TrCPβ-transducin repeat-containing proteinCD40LCD40 ligandCHXcycloheximideIBimmunoblottingIPimmunoprecipitationNIKNF-κB-inducing kinaseTNFαtumor necrosis factor α. complex composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα (IKK1) and IKKβ (IKK2), and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (NEMO) (10Ghosh S.

Once activated, IKK phosphorylates specific serines within the IκB proteins, triggering their ubiquitination by the ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP and degradation by the 26 S proteasome, thus allowing the NF-κB dimers to move to the nucleus to induce gene expression (10Ghosh S.

These specific stimuli activate NIK, which in turn activates IKKα and recruits it into p100 complex to phosphorylate p100 (18Xiao G. Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol.

Currently, the mechanism by which the physiological inducers activate NIK to trigger p100 processing remains largely unknown. Here, we have shown that BAFF- and CD40L-mediated NIK activation is through up-regulation of NIK protein level. In the resting B cells, NIK protein is undetectable, although NIK mRNA is relatively abundant and undergoes constitutive protein synthesis. The undetectable NIK protein is due to proteasome-mediated degradation. Although there is no contribution to NIK expression at transcriptional and translational levels, both BAFF and CD40L significantly up-regulate the level of NIK protein by rescuing the basally translated NIK proteins from undergoing degradation. Interestingly, overexpressed or purified NIK protein triggers p100 processing in the absence of additional stimuli and de novo protein synthesis. These results thus suggest that NIK protein stabilization functions as a switch for inducible processing of p100. These results also provide the first evidence for explaining why the non-canonical NF-κB pathway is delayed and can be inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitor. Expression Vectors and Antibodies and Other Reagents—Expression vectors encoding p100 and NIK have been described before (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The anti-NIK (H248) and anti-IKKα (H744) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The antibody recognizing the N terminus of p100 (anti-p100N) was described previously (20Qing G. Qu Z. Xiao G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44563-44572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody for human CD40 was prepared from a hybridoma (G28–5) provided by Dr. S. C. Sun. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), cycloheximide (CHX), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and ionomycin were from Sigma. Human BAFF and MG132 were from Amgen Biologicals and Calbiochem, respectively. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human B cell line Romas RG69 was a gift from Dr. L. Covey. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were described before (12Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S-C.

Immunoblotting (IB) and Immunoprecipitation (IP)—Whole-cell lysates and cytoplasmic lysates were prepared by lysing the cells in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium-deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and Buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture, respectively. For IB assays, the whole-cell lysates (∼10 μg for transfected 293 cells and ∼30 μg for other cells) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to IB using the indicated antibodies. For NIK IP assays, the cytoplasmic lysates (∼1000 μg) were diluted to 1 ml using RIPA buffer, incubated with 5 μl of NIK antibodies for 1 h and with 30 μl protein-A-agarose for another 2 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by 2× SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and IB analysis (20Qing G. Qu Z. Xiao G. J. Biol.

Cell Labeling and Pulse-Chase Assays—Transfected 293 cells were starved for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine, followed by metabolical labeling for 30 min with 350 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine. The pulse-labeled cells were chased for different time periods in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mm cold methionine and lysed in RIPA buffer. The radiolabeled p100 and its processed product p52 were isolated by IP using anti-p100N antibodies, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 12Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S-C.

For the stability of endogenous NIK proteins, the Romas RG69 B cells were labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine/cysteine in the presence or absence of BAFF or anti-CD40, followed by chasing in normal medium supplemented with 10 mm cold methionine. The radiolabeled NIK proteins were isolated by IP using anti-NIK antibodies, or the B cells were treated for 2 h with BAFF or anti-CD40 or phosphate-buffered saline (mock) and chased by directly adding cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) into medium. The NIK proteins were immunoprecipitated and detected by IB using anti-NIK antibodies. In Vitro p100-processing Assays—The NIK proteins were generated in vitro with the TNT T7-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) and further purified by NIK IP. The cell extracts from 293 cells transfected with p100 were prepared as described before (4Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The immunopurified NIK proteins from in vitro translation and the 293 cell extracts were mixed in the presence or absence of 100 ng/μl CHX. The mixture then was incubated for 2 h at 30°C in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 0.2 μg/μl creatine kinase for in vitro processing reaction, followed by IB using p100N antibodies. Isolation of Polysomes and RNA from Romas RG69 Cells—Romas RG69 cells were treated for 2 h with anti-CD40 antibody (10 μg/ml) or BAFF (250 ng/ml) or left untreated. 20% of treated or untreated cells (2 × 107 cells/each group) were pelleted and employed as a source for total RNA using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The remaining cells were incubated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for 15 min, followed by cytoplasm extraction. The cytoplasmic extract was then loaded onto a linear 10–45% (w/w) sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 2.5 h at 36,000 rpm with a Beckman SW-41 rotor. After centrifugation, the gradient was fractionated and its absorbance at 254 nm was determined continuously by an Isco UA-5 monitor as described before (25Qu X. Yang Z. Zhang S. Shen L. Dangel A.W. Hughes J.H. Redman K.L. Wu L.C. Yu C.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4068-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The polysome-containing fractions were pooled and subjected to phenol extraction. RNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Real-time RT-PCR Analysis— 2 μg of total RNA or RNA isolated from polysomes were reverse-transcribed for RT-PCR using the following primers: for NIK, forward 5′-CTCAGCATCGACAGCCTCTC, reverse 5′-GTGCACTGCAGGTCGATGC; for glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward 5′-CACAGTCCATGCCATCACTG and reverse 5′-CTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATG. Real-time PCR assays were performed with an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system using the SYBR Green PCR Core reagent (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers used for real-time PCR were: human NIK, forward 5′-CCCACCTTTTCAGAAGCATT, reverse 5′-CATTTTGCCCTCTGTAGCATGG; human p100, forward 5′-TGCCATTGTGTTCCGGACA, reverse 5′-TGTTTGGAATCAGACACGTCCC; human β-actin, forward 5-ATCAAGATCATTGCTCCTCCT, reverse 5′-AGCGAGGCCAGGATGGA; human 18 S RNA, forward 5′-AGGAATTGACGGAAGGGCAC, reverse 5′-GGACATCTAAGGGCATCACA. The Dynamics of p100 Processing Triggered by Receptor Ligation Is Much Slower than That Induced by Downstream NIK—To investigate the mechanism by which receptor ligation activates downstream NIK to induce p100 processing, we examined the kinetics of p100 processing induced by BAFF, CD40L, and NIK overexpression. As shown in Fig. 1A, NIK-induced p100 processing was readily detected at 15 min of chase (Fig. 1A, lane 4). However, p100 processing triggered by ligation of BAFF receptor or CD40 was much slower; it could be detected only after 2 h of BAFF or CD40 antibody treatment, although it also persisted over a long time period (Fig. 1B, lanes 2-9). Thus, it took more than 1.5 h for the receptor ligation to activate NIK for p100 processing. Transfected or Purified NIK Can Mediate p100 Processing in the Absence of de Novo Protein Synthesis—Recent studies have indicated that p100 processing induced by receptor ligation requires de novo protein synthesis (15Claudio E. Brown K. Park S. Wang H. Siebenlist U. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 17Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J. Holman M.J. Klaus G.G. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). However, the synthesized protein(s) still remains mysterious. Based on the results above, we hypothesized that NIK, but not p100, is the de novo synthesized protein required for p100 processing. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown before that the activity of NIK is constitutive and a little amount of NIK protein readily induces p100 processing without any further stimuli (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 26Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21081-21085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To test this possibility, we examined p100 processing in NIK-transfected cells in the presence or absence of CHX, a specific protein synthesis inhibitor. In sharp contrast to receptor ligation-mediated processing of p100 (Fig. 2A), NIK-induced p100 processing is insensitive to CHX (Fig. 2B, compare lane 4 with lane 5). To extend our studies, we also performed in vitro p100 processing assay using purified NIK protein. Consistently, purified NIK could also efficiently induce p100 processing in vitro even in the presence of CHX (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, NIK-mediated p100 processing does not require protein synthesis, supporting that NIK, but definitely not p100, is the newly synthesized protein required for processing of p100 induced by receptor ligation. NIK Protein Expression Is Specifically Up-regulated by Receptor Ligation for p100 Processing and This Up-regulation Can Be Blocked by Protein Synthesis Inhibitor—If our hypothesis above is right, the expression of NIK should be very low in unstimulated cells and the receptor ligation for p100 processing would induce NIK protein expression. To confirm this, we examined the expression of endogenous NIK protein. Indeed, the level of NIK protein is extremely low, because we failed to detect NIK protein even by direct NIK IP assays (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lane 3). More importantly, the NIK protein was significantly increased upon stimulation of the cells with BAFF or CD40 antibody (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lanes 4 and 5). This up-regulation of NIK protein seems very specific, because mitogens phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin and cytokine TNFα, which can activate canonical but not non-canonical NF-κB signaling, failed to do so (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, the up-regulation of NIK protein level was efficiently blocked by CHX (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lanes 3 and 5). Parallel IB analysis revealed that the expression of IKKα, the downstream kinase of NIK required for p100 processing, was abundant and not affected by these stimuli (Fig. 3, A and B, lower panel, lanes 1–5). The Up-regulation of NIK Proteins Is via Stabilization of NIK Proteins from the Basal Translation but Not Associated with an Obvious Elevation of RNA Transcription or Protein Translation of NIK—To further investigate the mechanism of NIK protein up-regulation, we performed real-time RT-PCR and polysome fractionation analysis to examine whether either BAFF or CD40 antibody treatment induces mRNA transcription and protein translation of NIK, respectively. As a control, the transcription and translation of p100 mRNA was also included. Interestingly, we found that CD40 antibody treatment, but not BAFF treatment, enhanced p100 mRNA transcription and subsequent protein translation (Fig. 4, A and B, columns 4–6), which is consistent with the finding that CD40L can also activate canonical NF-κB to induce p100 expression whereas BAFF can only activate non-canonical, but not canonical, NF-κB (15Claudio E. Brown K. Park S. Wang H. Siebenlist U. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the NIK mRNA, like p100 mRNA, also showed constitutive translation (Fig. 4A, column 1). It was more surprising that BAFF treatment and CD40 antibody treatment hardly enhance NIK protein synthesis (Fig. 4A, columns 2 and 3). Consistently, our RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR analyses indicated that the total mRNA level of NIK was relatively abundant and marginally affected by either BAFF or CD40 antibody treatment (Fig. 4B, columns 1–3). Based on the results above, we then postulated that the synthesized NIK proteins from the basal translation are immediately degraded and the ligation of BAFF receptor and CD40 stabilizes these newly synthesized NIK proteins. Indeed, we found that in the presence of MG132, a specific proteasome inhibitor, NIK protein could be detected even without stimulation by BAFF or CD40 antibody (Fig. 4C, upper panel, lane 2). However, this effect of MG132 could be blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX (Fig. 4C, upper panel, lane 5). Consistent with our polysome fractionation analysis indicating that BAFF and CD40 antibody treatments do not contribute to NIK protein synthesis, neither BAFF nor CD40 antibody treatment further enhanced NIK protein level in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 4C, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, ligation of BAFF receptor and CD40 rescued the basally translated NIK proteins from undergoing degradation, thereby triggering p100 processing. To further substantiate our findings, we tried to compare the stability of NIK protein in the stimulated and unstimulated B cells by performing two different pulse-chase assays. Both pulse-chase assays indicated that the half-life of NIK in the presence of either BAFF or anti-CD40 antibodies was ∼3 h (Fig. 5A, lanes 3–10, 5B, 5C, lanes 1–6, and 5D). However, we failed to examine the half-life of NIK in the unstimulated B cells because we were unable to obtain sufficient NIK for efficient detection or pulse labeling (Fig. 5A, lane 1,5C, lane 7, and data not shown). In fact, we were even unable to obtain enough NIK proteins from B cells stably infected with NIK for pulse-chase assays (data not shown). Nevertheless, these results were highly consistent with our findings that NIK protein in the resting B cells was extremely low (Figs. 3 and 4). These results also suggested that the newly synthesized NIK protein in the resting B cells was rapidly degraded by the proteasome, whereas the BAFF or anti-CD40 treatment was to protect NIK from undergoing degradation. It is clear that NIK is essential for non-canonical NF-κB signaling. However, how NIK is regulated remains largely unknown. In this study, we systematically analyzed NIK expression at different levels in the presence or absence of the non-canonical NF-κB stimuli BAFF or CD40L. In unstimulated cells, the expression level of NIK protein is extremely low; however, NIK expression is significantly up-regulated by BAFF and CD40L (Fig. 3A). The up-regulation of NIK protein is specific, because TNF and mitogens fail to induce NIK protein (Fig. 3A). Because TNF and mitogens also fail to induce p100 processing, although they efficiently activate IKKα (downstream kinase of NIK for p100 processing) (8Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 12Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), these studies provide evidence why most of the canonical NF-κB stimuli including mitogens and TNFα fail to induce p100 processing, further suggesting that up-regulation of NIK proteins serves as a molecular switch for p100 processing. Indeed, transfected or purified NIK induces p100 processing in the absence of additional stimuli and de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 2, B and C). Although the up-regulation of NIK protein and subsequent p100 processing by receptor ligation can be blocked by protein synthesis inhibitor (Fig. 2A and Fig. 3), these non-canonical NF-κB inducers apparently fail to enhance RNA transcription and protein translation of NIK (Fig. 4, A and B). In fact, NIK mRNA is relatively abundant and constitutively undergoes basal translation (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, it seems that the role of the non-canonical NF-κB stimuli in p100 processing is to inhibit NIK degradation machinery so that the NIK proteins from basal translation gradually accumulate. Indeed, inhibition of the proteasome also efficiently up-regulates NIK protein level (Fig. 4C). These findings thus not only demonstrate one important mechanism of NIK regulation but also explain why the non-canonical NF-κB pathway is delayed and can be inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitor (Figs. 1 and 2A). Our studies also rule out the possibility that de novo synthesis of p100 protein itself is required for its processing. First, transfected or purified NIK induces p100 processing in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, including de novo synthesis of p100 protein (Fig. 2, B and C). Second, stimuli that fail to up-regulate NIK protein also fail to induce p100 processing, though they can activate IKKα and induce p100 expression (12Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Third, p100 undergoes constitutive synthesis but no processing without specific stimuli. Last, BAFF induces p100 processing but cannot induce p100 synthesis (Fig. 4A). Although CD40 induces p100 protein expression via canonical NF-κB activation, the induced p100 is not required for, although it contributes to, CD40-induced p100 processing because CD40-induced p100 processing is independent of IKKγ, an essential component for canonical NF-κB activation and subsequent p100 induction. Together, these findings strongly suggest that NIK, but not p100, is the newly synthesized protein required for p100 processing, further substantiating our previous finding that p100 processing is post-translational (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). We thank L. Covey, W. C. Greene, and S. C. Sun for various invaluable materials.

https://openalex.org/W1982251171,"Proinflammatory cytokines have been linked to depression of myocardial contractility in vivo in patients with acute septic shock and in vitro models employing isolated myocytes exposed to serum from such patients. The key pathways involved in mediating this septic organ dysfunction (cell adhesion molecule expression, inducible nitric-oxide synthase induction, and apoptosis) are known to be regulated by transcription factors STAT1, IRF1, and NF-kappaB. Utilizing a model that mimics human disease, we have demonstrated activation of the transcription factors STAT1, IRF1, and NF-kappaB in human fetal myocytes exposed to human septic serum. Both reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated a 5-19-fold increase in activation of transcription factors STAT1, IRF1, and NF-kappaB in response to incubation with human septic serum. The addition of human septic serum to human fetal myocytes induced apoptosis in human fetal myocytes and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH -terminal kinase and caspase 1 as measured by Western blot. These data suggest that transcription factor activation and early myocyte apoptosis play a mechanistic role in septic myocardial depression and sepsis-induced organ dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2034255563,"The amyloid β-protein precursor intracellular domain fragment (AICD) is generated from amyloid β-protein precursor by consecutive cleavages. AICD is thought to activate FE65-dependent gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remains under consideration. We found that dimeric 14-3-3γ bound both AICD and FE65 simultaneously, and this binding facilitated FE65-dependent gene transactivation by enhancing the association of AICD with FE65. 14-3-3γ bound to the 667VTPEER672 motif of AICD and, most interestingly, the phosphorylation of AICD at Thr-668 in this motif inhibited the interaction with 14-3-3γ and blocked gene transactivation. 14-3-3γ required a sequence between the WW domain and the first phosphotyrosine interaction domain of FE65 for association with FE65. Deletion of this region blocked 14-3-3γ binding to FE65 and suppressed AICD-mediated FE65-dependent gene transactivation, although the deletion mutant FE65 was still able to bind Tip60, a histone acetyltransferase that forms a complex with FE65 in the nucleus. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 14-3-3γ facilitates FE65-dependent gene transactivation by forming a complex containing AICD and FE65, and phosphorylation of AICD down-regulates FE65-dependent gene transactivation through the dissociation of 14-3-3γ and/or FE65 from AICD. Our findings suggest that multiple interactions of AICD with FE65 and 14-3-3γ modulate FE65-dependent gene transactivation.

Nature. 2003; 426: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). APP is cleaved consecutively, first at the extracellular juxtamembrane region by α- or β-secretase and second at the intramembrane region by γ-secretase (2Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5164) Google Scholar). Following the first cleavage, sAPPα or sAPPβ (large extracellular amino-terminal domains truncated at the α and β sites, respectively) is secreted, and then following the second cleavage, p3 or β-amyloid peptides are secreted, together with release of the cytoplasmic fragment into the cytoplasm. The metabolism of APP resembles that of Notch, a cell surface receptor essential for the commitment to cell differentiation (3Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3732-3739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).

However, it remains uncertain whether other motifs regulate AICD function and whether other protein factors play an important role in the regulation of AICD-mediated FE65-dependent gene transactivation. To reveal the role of AICD in FE65-dependent gene transactivation may contribute to understanding the physiological roles of APP and the pathogenesis of AD. In the present study, we found that the 667VTPEER672 motif regulates AICD function in FE65-dependent gene transactivation through the phosphorylation of Thr-668 and interactions with the 14-3-3γ protein. Mammalian 14-3-3 proteins are a ubiquitously expressed gene family with seven distinct isoforms that are involved in various signal transduction pathways (32Aiken A. Baxter H. Dubois T. Clokie S. Mackie S. Mitchell K. Peden A. Zemlickova E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 351-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 14-3-3γ is one of the most abundant isoforms in brain, skeletal muscle, and heart (33Patel Y. Martin H. Howell S. Jones D. Robinson K. Aiken A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34Horie M. Suzuki M. Takahashi E. Tanigami A. Genomics. 1999; 60: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We found that association of the 14-3-3γ dimer with both nonphosphorylated AICD and FE65 facilitates gene expression, whereas the phosphorylation of AICD interferes with 14-3-3γ binding and down-regulates FE65-dependent gene transactivation. These findings, taken together with our previous report that the phosphorylation of AICD suppresses its interaction with FE65 (21Ando K. Iijima K.I. Elliott J.I. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40353-40361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), suggest that the AICD 667VTPEER672 motif is an important regulatory region for AICD-mediated FE65-dependent gene transactivation. Plasmid Construction—cDNAs encoding the six human 14-3-3 isoforms used in this study, β (GenBank™ accession number 21328444), ϵ (GenBank™ accession number 21328449), γ (GenBank™ accession number 21464100), η (GenBank™ accession number 2146102), θ (GenBank™ accession number 2146103), and ζ (GenBank™ accession number 21735623), were amplified by PCR. The entire coding sequence was inserted into the NheI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1-N-FLAG to generate pcDNA3.1-FLAG-14-3-3. The cDNA encoding 14-3-3γ was also cloned into the NheI/XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1 vector with an amino-terminal 3Myc tag to produce pcDNA3.1-3Myc-14-3-3γ. cDNAs encoding human Tip60 (GenBank™ accession number 36287048) and AICD (carboxyl-terminal 44 amino acids of human APP695, C44) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector with an amino-terminal EGFP sequence to produce pcDNA3.1-EGFP-Tip60 and pcDNA3.1-EGFP-AICD, respectively. The cDNA encoding APP695 (21Ando K. Iijima K.I. Elliott J.I. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40353-40361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) was recloned into the NheI/ApaI sites of pcDNA3.1 to generate pcDNA3.1-APP. The cDNA encoding FE65 (24Borg J.P. Yang Y. De Taddeo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) was recloned into the NheI/NotI sites of pcDNA3.1-N-FLAG to generate pcDNA3.1-FLAG-FE65. cDNA encoding the amino acid sequence between amino acids 313 and 356 of FE65 was deleted by PCR to produce pcDNA3.1-FLAG-FE65Δ1. cDNAs encoding deletion constructs, pcDNA3.1-14-3-3γ-71C (lacking the amino-terminal 70 amino acids of 14-3-3γ) and pcDNA3.1-14-3-3γ-N160 (lacking the carboxyl-terminal 87 amino acids of 14-3-3γ) were prepared by PCR. To construct pcDNA3.1-APP-T668D, substitution of Asp for Thr-668 was performed using site-directed mutagenesis with PCR. pSRα-3HA-JNKK2-JNK1 and pSRα-3HA-JNKK2(K149M)-JNK1 have been described previously (35Engelman J.A.

Plasmids encoding proteins fused with green fluorescent protein variants were prepared as follows. cDNA encoding AICD(C44) was cloned into the NheI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1-N-CFP to generate pcDNA3.1-CFP-AICD(C44); cDNA encoding human 14-3-3γ was cloned into the NheI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1-N-YFP to generate pcDNA3.1-YFP-14-3-3γ; and cDNA encoding human FE65 was cloned into the NheI/NotI sites of pcDNA3.1-N-RFP to generate pcDNA3.1-N-RFP-FE65. cDNA encoding a typical nuclear localization signal (NLS, the NH2-DPKKKRKV-COOH sequence was used) tandemly repeated three times was inserted into the NheI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1-N-CFP or pcDNA3.1-N-RFP to generate pcDNA3.1-CFP-NLS or pcDNA3.1-RFP-NLS. Antibodies—Anti-FLAG (M2) mouse monoclonal and anti-APP rabbit polyclonal (αAPP/C) antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-synaptotagmin 1 (SYT) mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 41) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-GST mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-EGFP rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. Anti-14-3-3γ (UT116) rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the peptide 14-3-3γ-(235-247)-(Cys), and its specificity was verified (supplemental Fig. 1). An APP phosphorylation state-specific mouse monoclonal antibody, 10A3, was prepared against the Thr-668-phosphorylated AICD peptide (amino acids 649-695 of APP695), and the antibody recognized the phosphorylated peptide but not the nonphosphorylated AICD peptide (supplemental Fig. 2). The anti-APP rabbit polyclonal antibody G369 was supplied by Dr. Gandy, and its specificity has been described (36Oishi M. Nairn A.C. Czernik A.J. Lim G.S. Isohara T. Gandy S.M. Greengard P. Suzuki T. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 111-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding Assay—The cDNA encoding 14-3-3γ was recloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to produce a GST-14-3-3γ fusion protein. The synthetic AICD(C47) peptide (8.3 pmol) with or without phosphate at Thr-668 (21Ando K. Iijima K.I. Elliott J.I. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40353-40361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) was mixed with 3 pmol of GST-14-3-3γ or 6 pmol of GST alone in HBS-N buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). The GST fusion protein was recovered by pull down with glutathione beads, and the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Neuro-2a (N2a) cells (4.5 × 105 cells) were transfected with the indicated plasmids, as described previously (37Sumioka A. Imoto S. Martins R.N. Kitino Y. Suzuki T. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured for 24 h and lysed in HBS-N buffer on ice. After centrifugation (15,000 × g for 10 min), antibody was added to the supernatant of the lysate. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Brains of wild type mouse (C57BL/6, 8-week-old males) and APP-T668D mutant mouse congenic to C57BL/6 (12-week-old males) were homogenized on ice in a 4-fold volume of buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.32 m sucrose, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin) by 10 strokes of a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 7 min, and the supernatants were then further centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting precipitates were lysed for 1 h on ice in HBS-N buffer. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, 0.3 μl of UT116 antiserum or 1 μg of nonimmune rabbit IgG was added to the supernatant of the HBS-N lysate together with protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitate was eluted by addition of the UT116 antigen peptide (1.5 mg/ml), and the eluate was analyzed by Western blotting with specific antibodies. Gene Transactivation Assays—The cDNA of APP695 was inserted into the NheI/NotI sites of pBIND-C-Gal4BD to construct pBIND-APP-Gal4BD, which has a Gal4 DNA-binding domain inserted into the 3′ end of APP. To construct pBIND-AICD(C44)-Gal4BD, pBIND-C30-Gal4BD, pBIND-C20-Gal4BD, pBIND-C49-Gal4BD, and pBIND-AICD-(T668D)-Gal4BD, the cDNAs that encode the respective amino acids at positions 652-695, 666-695, and 676-695 of APP695 were generated by PCR using pcDNA3.1-APP or pcDNA3.1-APP-T668D as templates and cloned into the NheI/XhoI sites of pBIND-C-Gal4BD. To construct pBIND-S-rich-C20-Gal4BD, the cDNA that encodes amino acids 191-220 of XB51α (37Sumioka A. Imoto S. Martins R.N. Kitino Y. Suzuki T. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was generated by PCR using pcDNA3.1-FLAG-XB51α as a template and inserted into the 5′ end of pBIND-C20-Gal4BD. The cDNA of Tip60 was recloned into the NheI/XhoI sites of pBIND-N-Gal4BD to construct pBIND-Gal4BD-Tip60, which had a Gal4 DNA-binding domain inserted into the 5′ end of Tip60. N2a cells (1.8 × 104 cells) plated in 96-multiwell plates were transiently transfected, using LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen), with the indicated amounts of pBIND plasmids and pG5luc (Promega), a reporter luciferase gene having a Gal4 DNA-binding sequence on its promotor, in the presence of various cDNAs inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector. To standardize the overall amount of plasmid used, empty vector was added. The transcriptional activity of the reporter gene was analyzed by using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). All of the combinations were tested in quadruplicate, and the luciferase activity was normalized according to the manufacturer's protocol to eliminate the effect of transfection efficiency differences. Knock down Study with RNAi—cDNAs of small interfering RNA were designed against the human 14-3-3γ (nucleotides 635-654) or 14-3-3ϵ (nucleotides 282-300) genes and subcloned into the pSuper vector (OligoEngine). N2a cells (1.2 × 104 cells) were transfected with 200 ng of pSuper14-3-3γ or pSuper14-3-3ϵ in Lipofectamine 2000, and the expression level of endogenous 14-3-3γ was examined by Western blot analysis with the UT116 antibody. Intracellular Localization of Fluorescent Protein Fusion Proteins—N2a cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids encoding GFP fusion proteins using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured for 24 h and viewed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). Association of 14-3-3γ with Nonphosphorylated APP and AICD—Comprehensive screening of a human brain cDNA library with the yeast two-hybrid system using the cytoplasmic domain of APP as bait resulted in isolation of cDNA clones encoding a part of the 14-3-3γ protein (data not shown). Thus, we prepared complete cDNA clones encoding 14-3-3 isoforms evolutionarily close to 14-3-3γ, except for 14-3-3δ (Fig. 1a), and we examined their association with APP by coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 1b). N2a cells expressing amino-terminal FLAG-tagged 14-3-3β, -ϵ, -γ, -η, or -θ isoforms and APP were lysed and subjected to coimmunoprecipitation assays with anti-FLAG antibody. The immunoprecipitates (IP) and cell lysates (lysate) were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG and anti-APP antibodies. APP was recovered in FLAG-14-3-3γ and FLAG-14-3-3η immunoprecipitates, but 14-3-3β, 14-3-3ϵ, and 14-3-3θ failed to coimmunoprecipitate APP. Control antibody from nonimmunized animals did not recover either 14-3-3γ or APP, indicating that the intracellular interaction between 14-3-3γ and APP is specific (Fig. 1c). Because FLAG-14-3-3γ binding to APP was stronger than that of FLAG-14-3-3η (Fig. 1b) and both 14-3-3γ and 14-3-3ϵ have been associated with AD (38Fountoulakis M. Cairns N. Lubec G. J. Neural Transm. 1999; 57: 323-335Google Scholar), we focused our analysis on the role of 14-3-3γ in APP function. Among the postulated APP functions, such as providing a cargo receptor on transport vesicles (27Taru H. Iijima K. Hase M. Kirino Y. Yagi Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

AICD and FE65 are thought to associate with several proteins to stimulate gene transactivation. Thus, we analyzed the interaction of AICD with 14-3-3γ. A GST-14-3-3γ fusion protein was incubated with a synthetic AICD peptide (649-695 of APP695, C47), with or without phosphorylation of the Thr-668 residue, which is a major phosphorylation site in brain and cultured cells (41Iijima K.

Many 14-3-3 proteins bind to phosphorylated target proteins and regulate their function and/or structure (44van Hemert M.J. Steensma H.Y. van Heusden G.P. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The GST-14-3-3γ, however, bound the nonphosphorylated AICD peptide but did not bind AICD peptide phosphorylated at Thr-668 (Fig. 1d). The physiological significance of this interaction was confirmed using mouse brain samples (Fig. 1e). The 14-3-3γ-specific antibody UT116 (supplemental Fig. 1) was used to immunoprecipitate the protein from mouse brain lysates, and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blotting for 14-3-3γ, APP, APP phosphorylated at Thr-668, and synaptotagmin 1. The 14-3-3γ antibody coimmunoprecipitated APP but not Thr-668-phosphorylated APP and synaptotagmin 1, indicating that the association of 14-3-3γ with APP occurs in brain and the phosphorylation of APP interferes with the interaction (Fig. 1e, left). Because we have established a mutant mouse line, in which the phosphorylation site Thr-668 in APP is altered to Asp-668 and Ala-668, 4K. Seki, S. Takeda, Y. Sano, T. Nakaya, E. Kawaguchi, T. Suzuki, and S. Itohara, submitted for publication. we examined the association of 14-3-3γ with APP in the T668D mutant mouse brain. 14-3-3γ was immunoprecipitated from a mutant mouse brain lysate using the 14-3-3γ-specific antibody UT116, and the immunoprecipitate did not contain the T668D APP (Fig. 1e, right). AICD was not detected in these assays, and this may be due to the small amounts or very rapid catabolism of AICD in brain. We have reported previously that phosphorylation of Thr-668 in the 667VTPEER672 motif suppressed the interaction of AICD with FE65, which recognizes the 681GYENPTY687 motif, because the phosphorylation of Thr-668 affects the amino-terminal helix capping-box structure composed of 667VTPEER672 and the helical state of the following amino acid sequence that includes the 681GYENTPY687 FE65-binding motif (21Ando K.

To confirm that 14-3-3γ binds to APP through the 667VTPEER672 motif, we examined 14-3-3γ binding to other motifs. 14-3-3γ failed to bind to APP when a region containing the 667VTPEER672 motif was deleted, but not when regions containing the 653YTSI656 or 681GYENPTY687 motifs were deleted (supplemental Fig. 3). Therefore, our observations confirm that 14-3-3γ binds to the 667VTPEER672 motif, that Thr-668 in this motif is important for the 14-3-3γ-APP interaction, and that the phosphorylation of Thr-668 suppresses the association of APP and AICD with 14-3-3γ. Association of 14-3-3γ with AICD Facilitates FE65-dependent Gene Transactivation—Because 14-3-3γ associated with AICD, we explored the effect of 14-3-3γ on FE65-dependent gene transactivation mediated by AICD. pBIND-AICD(C44)-Gal4BD and pG5luc were transfected in N2a cells expressing different isoforms of 14-3-3, in the presence (+) or absence (-) of FE65. The AICD-Gal4BD fusion protein showed FE65-dependent gene transactivation (Fig. 2a, compare lane 2 with lane 1), as reported previously (11Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Coexpression of 14-3-3γ or 14-3-3η enhanced this activity to 2-2.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 2a, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lane 2), which is consistent with the affinity of their binding to APP (Fig. 1b). AICD(C49), a product of the ϵ-site cleavage of APP (45Gu Y. Misonou M. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol.

Similar to AICD(C44) (Fig. 1b and Fig. 2a), AICD(C49) mediated FE65-dependent gene transactivation, and transactivation was enhanced by 14-3-3γ (supplemental Fig. 4). Transactivation by other 14-3-3 isoforms was absent or minimal (Fig. 2a, compare lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8 with lane 2)."

Apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is thought to contribute to the increased area of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and Akt activation exerts a powerful cardioprotective effect after ischemia. Thus, a therapeutic strategy designed to inhibit expression of SHP-1 would be beneficial in AMI. Here we report that siRNA targeting SHP-1 reduced infarct size in a rat model of AMI. Upon injection into the ischemic left ventricular wall, the vector-based siRNA significantly suppressed the increase in the SHP-1 mRNA and the SHP-1 protein levels. The siRNA vector also significantly reduced the SHP-1 that bound to Fas-R. The SHP-1 siRNA vector increased phospho-Akt and reduced DNA fragmentation and caspase activity compared with the scramble siRNA vector. Finally, the area of myocardial infarction was significantly smaller with the SHP-1 siRNA vector than with the scramble siRNA vector at 2 days after LCA ligation. In conclusion, SHP-1 in the heart increased from the early stage of AMI, and this increase was thought to contribute to the increased area of myocardial infarction. Suppression of SHP-1 with the SHP-1 siRNA vector markedly reduced the infarct size in AMI."

Many have been shown to play pivotal roles in the organization and expression of eukaryotic genomes. It is clear that their activities need to be tightly regulated to ensure their coordinated action. However, little is known about how ATP-dependent remodelers are regulated at the molecular level. Here, we have investigated the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme Mi-2 of Drosophila melanogaster. Radioactive labeling of S2 cells reveals that dMi-2 is a phosphoprotein in vivo. dMi-2 phosphorylation is constitutive, and we identify dCK2 as a major dMi-2 kinase in cell extracts. dCK2 binds to and phosphorylates a dMi-2 N-terminal region. Dephosphorylation of recombinant dMi-2 increases its affinity for the nucleosome substrate, nucleosome-stimulated ATPase, and ATP-dependent nucleosome mobilization activities.

ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers play important roles in the regulation of eukaryotic genome organization and activity. All ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers known to date share a conserved SNF2 ATPase/helicase domain. The growing list of chromatin-remodeling ATPases is divided into several subfamilies. Four of these have been characterized to some extent and are distinguished by the presence of additional protein domains (1Eberharter A. Becker P.B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3707-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar): SWI2/SNF2 ATPases possess a bromo-domain that is important for stable binding to acetylated chromatin (2Hassan A.H.

They contain a pair of PHD fingers, in addition to the chromodomains present in all CHD family members.

NuRD complexes combine two enzymatic activities both of which are directed toward chromatin: a nucleosome remodeling ATPase activity, supplied by the Mi-2 subunit, and a type I histone deacetylase activity. NuRD complexes are believed to inhibit gene transcription by inducing repressive chromatin structures (13Bowen N.J. Fujita N. Kajita M. Wade P.A. Biochim. Biophys.

It has been suggested that specificity is achieved by interaction with cell type-specific transcriptional repressors that direct NuRD complexes to particular chromosomal sites. Indeed, Mi-2 has been reported to bind several sequence-specific repressors, including Hunchback, Tramtrack 69, Ailos, Ikaros, nuclear hormone receptors, and Bcl-6 (12Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T.

Many NuRD complexes contain subunits with methylated DNA binding domains, and it has been proposed that binding to methylated DNA constitutes an alternative mechanism of NuRD complex recruitment (8Feng Q.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies suggest a genome wide association of Mi-2 with chromatin (28Li J. Lin Q. Wang W. Wade P. Wong J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the dMi-2 “corepressor” appears to localize to most sites of active transcription on polytene chromosomes (29Srinivasan S. Armstrong J.A. Deuring R. Dahlsveen I.K. McNeill H. Tamkun J.W. Development. 2005; 132: 1623-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These results suggest that chromatin association alone is not sufficient for the formation of repressive chromatin structure. Rather, these studies emphasize the need for regulation of NuRD activity at steps subsequent to chromatin binding. Regulation of enzymatic activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers is not well understood, and only a few mechanisms have been described. The activities of SWI2/SNF2 and ISWI ATPases can be modulated by interaction with non-enzymatic complex subunits in vitro (30Eberharter A. Ferrari S. Langst G. Straub T. Imhof A. Varga-Weisz P.

Science. 2003; 299: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Finally, chromatin association and remodeling by SWI2/SNF2 ATPases is regulated by their phosphorylation status in a cell cycle-dependent manner (35Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 36Muchardt C. Reyes J.C. Bourachot B. Leguoy E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3394-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To date, no mechanism for the regulation of CHD activity has been described. Here, we have explored the possibility that dMi-2 is regulated by phosphorylation. Our results suggest that dMi-2 is constitutively phosphorylated in its N-terminal region in vivo, and we have identified dCK2 as a major dMi-2 kinase in Drosophila S2 cells. Dephosphorylation of dMi-2 increases its affinity for the nucleosome substrate and reduces its nucleosome-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent nucleosome mobilization activities. Dephosphorylation of dMi-2, therefore, provides a potential mechanism to rapidly and reversibly control dMi-2 activity at a step subsequent to chromatin association.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4332-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For expression, exponentially growing Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant viruses and harvested 48 h post-infection. Infected cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in LyBu 200, lysed by two cycles of freeze-thaw in liquid nitrogen, and sonicated. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation prior to adding M2-affinity gel (Sigma) to the lysate. After incubation, for at least 4 h at 4°C, the affinity gel was recovered by centrifugation and washed twice with 10 resin-volumes of LyBu 500, twice with 10 resin-volumes of LyBu 1000, once with 10 resin-volumes of LyBu 500, once with 10 resin-volumes of LyBu 200, and finally once with 1 ml of elution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol) without FLAG-peptide. Bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer containing FLAG peptide (0.25 mg/ml, Sigma). Eluates were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins from E. coli—Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli as GST fusions or with a C-terminal FLAG tag. Purification by glutathione and FLAG affinity chromatography was performed as described (7Brehm A. Langst G. Kehle J. Clapier C.R. Imhof A. Eberharter A. Muller J. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4332-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 38Hagemeier C. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4998-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assay—500 ng of FLAG-tagged dMi-2 proteins or 1 μg of GST-dMi-2-(4–560) were incubated in the presence of 5 μl of whole S2 cell extract or chromatographic fractions and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol in 10 mm Tricine, 370 MBq/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min at 30 °C in 20–30 μl of LyBu 100. In vitro phosphorylated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Gels were dried and phosphorylation was detected by phosphorimaging. Purification of dMi-2 Kinase by Affinity Chromatography—5 ml of GSTrap columns (Amersham Biosciences) was saturated with GST or GST-dMi-2-(4–560) proteins and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. About 50 ml of whole cell extracts (prepared from 109 S2 cells in LyBu 200) were loaded onto the GST column, and the flow-through was subsequently applied to the GST-dMi-2-(4–560) resin. After extensive washing with LyBu 200, bound proteins were eluted by increasing the KCl concentration to 1 m. Purification of dCK2 by Conventional Chromatography—dCK2 was purified as described before (39Yang Y. Cheng P. Liu Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 994-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: Whole cell extracts were prepared from 5 × 108 S2 cells in LyBu 200 and adjusted to 100 mm KCl prior to loading onto the first column (Q-Sepharose). After each step of this purification, 4 μl of the collected fractions was assayed for kinase activity and presence of dCK2 by Western blot. 10 μl of the Mono Q fractions was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or Western blotting. dMi-2 Sequence Analysis—CK2 consensus sites were identified using PPsearch (www.ebi.ac.uk/ppsearch/). Sequence alignments were performed with MulAlin (prodes.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/) using default parameters. Phosphatase Treatment for SDS-PAGE Analysis—About 500 ng of proteins was incubated with 0.5 unit of calf intestine phosphatase (CIP) for 30 min at 26 °C in the dephosphorylation buffer provided by the supplier (CIP buffer, Roche Applied Science), in the presence or absence of 20 mm phosphatase inhibitor (β-glycerophosphate). Proteins were next subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Phosphatase Treatment for Activity Assays—Baculovirus-expressed FLAG-tagged dMi-2 proteins were purified and immobilized on M2 affinity gel as described above. One-half of the material was treated with CIP (0.25 unit per μl of M2-gel) for 45 min at 26 °C, and the other half (mock treatment) was treated identically except that phosphatase was replaced by chicken-egg albumin (Sigma). FLAG beads were then subjected to extensive washes to remove the phosphatase, and dMi-2 proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide. Amounts of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated dMi-2 were monitored by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. ATPase Assays—ATPase assays were performed and analyzed as in a previous study (4Bouazoune K. Mitterweger A. Langst G. Imhof A. Akhtar A. Becker P.B. Brehm A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2430-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Nucleosome Mobilization Assay—Nucleosome mobilization assay were carried out as described before (40Eberharter A. Langst G. Becker P.B. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 377: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, mononucleosomes were assembled using a mixture of Drosophila histones and polyglutamic acid (Sigma P4886) on a radiolabeled 247-bp DNA fragment derived from the mouse rDNA promoter (–231 to +16, relative to transcription start site). Centrally and end-positioned nucleosomes were resolved by native gel electrophoresis through 4.5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.4× TBE (90 mm Tris borate pH 8.3; 2 nm EDTA). Separated mononucleosomes were eluted from the gel slices by diffusion for at least 1 h at 4 °C in EX50 buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 400 ng/μl bovine serum albumin. Isolated mononucleosomes positioned at the end of the 247-bp DNA fragment were incubated with dMi-2 proteins (90–450 fmol) for 90 min at 26 °C in a final volume of 10 μl of EX50 buffer containing 1 mm ATP and 400 ng/μl bovine serum albumin. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 700 ng of unlabeled plasmid DNA and further incubation for 10 min on ice. Histone octamer mobilization was monitored by native gel electrophoresis on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.4× TBE (at 100 V for 3 h). Gels were dried and exposed to film overnight at –80 °C. Nucleosome Binding Assays—Nucleosome core particle (NCP) probes were assembled by salt dialysis using a radiolabeled 146-bp DNA PCR fragment derived from the mouse rDNA promoter (–231 to –86, relative to transcription start site) and Drosophila histones. NCPs were gel-purified as described above. 10-μl reactions contained 60 fmol of NCPs in EX50 buffer and 400 ng/μl chicken-egg albumin. 1 μl of dMi-2 protein was added followed by 10-min incubation on ice. Samples were electrophoresed (80–100 V for 3–4 h) through 1.4% agarose gels in 0.4× TBE in a cold room. Gels were dried and exposed to film overnight at –80 °C. We have shown previously, that recombinant dMi-2 expressed in insect cells possesses low basal ATPase activity that is strongly stimulated in the presence of nucleosomes (4Bouazoune K. Mitterweger A. Langst G. Imhof A. Akhtar A. Becker P.B. Brehm A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2430-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Brehm A. Langst G. Kehle J. Clapier C.R. Imhof A. Eberharter A. Muller J. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4332-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). By contrast, recombinant dMi-2 expressed in Escherichia coli displays high basal activity that does not change in the presence of nucleosomes (data not shown). We hypothesized that the observed lack of ATPase regulation was due to a difference in post-translational modifications in bacterially expressed dMi-2. Many eukaryotic proteins display post-translational modifications that are usually absent from bacterially expressed recombinant proteins resulting in the loss of enzymatic and biological activity. In contrast, expression of a recombinant D. melanogaster protein in insect cells can be expected to result in a correct modification. To test if dMi-2 is indeed post-translationally modified in insect cells, we sought to determine its phosphorylation status in vivo. For that purpose, we incubated Drosophila S2 cells in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate to radioactively label proteins that became phosphorylated during the incubation period. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitations using antisera directed against the dMi-2 N or C terminus (α-dMi-2N and α-dMi-2C, respectively) were performed. The precipitated material was subjected to SDS-PAGE and phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography (Fig. 1A). Both dMi-2 antisera specifically precipitated two phosphoproteins with apparent molecular masses of 220 and 150 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). These two proteins were not efficiently precipitated when antiserum was omitted (lane 1) or when preimmune serum was used (lane 2). Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of the 220-kDa dMi-2 protein in both anti-dMi-2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4) strongly suggesting that the 220-kDa phosphoprotein is dMi-2. The identity of the 150-kDa phosphoprotein is at present unclear. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dMi-2 is phosphorylated in vivo. We next assessed whether we could detect dMi-2 kinase activity in S2 cell extracts, in vitro. We incubated recombinant dMi-2 in the presence of cell extract and [γ-32P]ATP and detected incorporation of [32P]phosphate by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging analysis. The extract showed robust and specific dMi-2 kinase activity (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 3). This allowed us to map the region phosphorylated by the dMi-2 kinase using a panel of dMi-2 deletion mutants (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation in mutants lacking amino acid residues 1–483 was weak (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5) or undetectable (lane 7). In contrast, the full-length protein and all proteins containing the N-terminal part of dMi-2 were efficiently phosphorylated in vitro (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 6, 8, and 9). We also expressed a fusion between GST and the N-terminal region of dMi-2 (amino acids 4–560 (17Kehle J. Beuchle D. Treuheit S. Christen B. Kennison J.A. Bienz M. Muller J. Science. 1998; 282: 1897-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar)) and tested whether this protein was a kinase substrate. The fusion protein, but not GST alone, was efficiently phosphorylated (Fig. 2B, lanes 10 and 11). This analysis defines residues 4–483 as being both required and sufficient for phosphorylation by dMi-2 kinase activity in vitro. We reasoned that, if the interaction between the kinase and dMi-2 N terminus is sufficiently stable, it might be possible to use the GST fusion protein to affinity-purify dMi-2 kinases from cell extracts. To this end, GST and the GST-dMi-2-(4–560) fusion protein were immobilized on different glutathione resins. We first loaded S2 extract onto the GST resin to deplete proteins that would bind nonspecifically to the GST moiety (Fig. 3A). The flow-through was then applied to the GST-dMi-2-(4–560) resin. Bound proteins were eluted by an increase of the salt concentration, and eluate fractions were assayed for dMi-2-kinase activity (Fig. 3B). This procedure resulted in a robust enrichment of dMi-2 kinase activity (compare fraction 4 (lane 5) to input (lane 1)). These results demonstrate that dMi-2 kinase activity present in S2 cell extract can stably interact with the N terminus of dMi-2.FIGURE 3dCK2 binds to the dMi-2 N terminus. A, scheme for affinity purification of dMi-2 kinase. For details see text. B, input (IN), flow-through (FT) and fractions eluted from the GST-dMi-2-(4–560) affinity column were incubated with recombinant GST-dMi-2-(4–560) kinase substrate and [γ-32P]ATP.

Several studies have suggested links between Mi-2 ATPases, cell cycle regulation, and transformation in mammalian cells (7Brehm A. Langst G. Kehle J. Clapier C.R. Imhof A. Eberharter A. Muller J.

Because of its diverse functions in various tissues, TSLC1 has been characterized by several independent research groups. It is also known, therefore, as RA175 (4Fujita E. Soyama A. Momoi T. Exp.

In a primary non-small cell lung cancer, we have found a 2-bp deletion in the TSLC1 that causes replacement of the C-terminal 19 amino acid residues, indicating that the cytoplasmic domain of TSLC1 is crucial for tumor suppression (2Kuramochi M.

TSLC1 was originally identified based upon its ability to sup-press tumorigenicity of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells in nude mice (2Kuramochi M. Fukuhara H. Nobukuni T. Kanbe T. Maruyama T.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT), in which polarized epithelial cells become motile fibroblast-like cells, occur during critical phases of normal embryonic development in multicellular organisms (12Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5487) Google Scholar). It has been known, however, that EMT contributes to invasion and metastasis of carcinoma cells from epithelial tumors (12Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev.

Res. 2004; 566: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The ‘scattering’ of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells by HGF is one of the well documented in vitro model systems that have been used to study the mechanisms of EMT (12Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5487) Google Scholar). When exposed to HGF, MDCK cells grown as small colonies on tissue culture plates respond by spreading, dissociating from each other, and scattering away from the colonies (12Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5487) Google Scholar). HGF induces a vast array of signaling through its receptor, c-Met, and one clear downstream target is the cytoskeleton, which is dramatically rearranged in response to HGF (12Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5487) Google Scholar). During HGF-induced EMT, the Rho family GTPases, especially Rho and Rac, function as key mediators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics (14Kamei T. Matozaki T. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Yokoyama S. Peng Y.F. Nakano K. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6776-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Another in vitro model involving EMT is HGF-induced MDCK tubulogenesis. A MDCK cell embedded in a collagen type I matrix forms a polarized lumen-enclosing epithelial monolayer called a cyst (15O'Brien L.E. Zegers M.M. Mostov K.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). When treated with HGF, the cyst develops branching tubules. Although tubulogenesis is a complex morphogenic process, partial EMT involving rearrangements of the cytoskeleton and the junctional complexes between cells plays a key role at the stage where single file chains of cells are extended away from the cyst (15O'Brien L.E. Zegers M.M. Mostov K.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In the present study using a series of truncation mutants, we examined the effect of TSLC1 on EMT in the MDCK-HGF model systems. The results suggest that TSLC1 suppresses the HGF-induced EMT through regulating the activation of small Rho GTPases.

A rabbit anti-hemagglutinin (HA) pAb (sc-805) and a mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (mAb) clone 12CA5 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Mouse mAbs against β-catenin, E-cadherin (clone 36), and fibronectin were from BD Biosciences. Other mouse mAbs used were specific to ZO-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and vimentin (clone V9, Sigma). Secondary antibodies for immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence staining were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab (West Grove, PA), respectively. Antibodies used for the Rac and Rho activation assay were a mouse anti-Rac1 mAb, clone 23A8, and a rabbit anti-Rho pAb (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Expression Vectors and Transfection—To obtain pTRE2/TSLC1, TSLC1 cDNA was cloned into a pTRE2hygro vector (BD Biosciences). Truncated TSLC1 fragments were generated by PCR using pTSLC1-HA (3Masuda M. Yageta M. Fukuhara H. Kuramochi M. Maruyama T. Nomoto A. Murakami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31014-31019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or pcTSLC1 (3Masuda M.

To generate a mutant lacking the cytoplasmic tail of TSLC1 (ΔC-HA), the amino acid residues positioned from 397 to 442 were removed, and the residue at 396 was fused with an HA epitope tag (Fig. 1A). The truncation mutants Δ4.1-BM and ΔPDZ-BM were designed to remove 11 amino acids (400-410) encompassing the protein 4.1-BM and 4 amino acids (439-442) containing the PDZ-BM, respectively (Fig. 1A). These constructs were transfected into the cells with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable clones were selected in medium containing 300 μg/ml of hygromycin (Invitrogen). Protein Analysis—Preparation of cell lysates and immunoblot analysis were described previously (9Yageta M. Kuramochi M. Masuda M. Fukami T. Fukuhara H. Maruyama T. Shibuya M. Murakami Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5129-5133PubMed Google Scholar). Gel was stained with Simply Blue Safestain (Invitrogen) when needed. Three-dimensional Culture in Collagen Gels and Tubulogenesis Assay—A three-dimensional culture was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Nitta Gelatin, Osaka, Japan). Cells were added to the collagen I mixture, gently mixed, and plated onto 12-well plates at 5 × 103 cells/well. Five-day-old cysts were examined for general cyst architecture and subcellular localization of the full-length TSLC1 and the deletion mutants. For induction of tubulogenesis, 4-day-old cysts were stimulated with fresh medium containing 40 ng/ml recombinant HGF (Sigma), incubated for 4 additional days, and examined by phase-contrast microscopy. All images were taken with a Nikon Eclipse inverted microscope TE300 (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a cooled CCD digital camera. To quantitate tubulogenesis, the area of cysts and tubules was calculated with NIH Image software. Cell Scattering Assay—Cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well in 6-well culture plates. On the next day, the cells were fed with fresh medium in the presence or absence of 40 ng/ml HGF and incubated for another 17 h. Cell scattering was examined by phase-contrast microscopy and photographed as described above. Cell scattering was quantified by counting the number of isolated cells from colonies and the total number of cells in randomly selected phase-contrast images. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—For the two-dimensional polarity experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ϕ24 mm Trans-well COL collagen-coated filter insert (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and allowed to grow to confluence for 5-6 days. The cells were fixed and immunostained as described previously (3Masuda M. Yageta M. Fukuhara H. Kuramochi M. Maruyama T. Nomoto A. Murakami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31014-31019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Then the stained cells were examined with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser confocal scanning system equipped with a 488/514-nm argon and a 543-nm helium-neon laser. The X-Z vertical sections were generated with a 0.2-μm motor step. Each image represents a single averaged (32-line scan) image. When staining for nuclear DNA, TOTO-3 iodide (Invitrogen) was added to the solution containing secondary antibodies. Immunofluorescent staining of the cysts in collagen type I gel was carried out as described previously (16Pollack A.L. Barth A.I. Altschuler Y. Nelson W.J. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1651-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Rac and Rho Activation Assay—Activation of Rac and Rho was determined by a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay using a Rac activation assay kit and a Rho activation kit (Upstate), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/100-mm culture plate and serum-starved overnight. Then, the cells were stimulated with 40 ng/ml HGF for various time periods and lysed in an MLB lysis buffer. Rac-GTP and Rho-GTP were precipitated from the lysates with the GST-tagged p21-activated kinase (PAK)-Rac binding domain (RBD) and the GST-tagged Rhotekin-Rho binding domain (RBD) immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, respectively. Total lysates and precipitates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Densitometric analyses were performed using NIH Image software. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed, where appropriate, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test or Student's t test. Isolation of Inducible Cell Clones Expressing Wild-type or Truncated TSLC1—MDCK Tet-Off cells, which express the tetracycline-repressible transactivator, were transfected with plasmids encoding the wild-type or truncated TSLC1 (Fig. 1A), and Dox-inducible clones were established. As a control, clones expressing GFP were also prepared. Immunoblot analysis has revealed that the obtained clones express the transgenes at a nearly equivalent level (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11). MDCK Tet-Off cells express a low level of endogenous TSLC1 detected as faint bands in Fig. 1B (lanes 1 and 2). Expression of the transgenes was tightly regulated with Dox in the established clones (Fig. 1B, lanes 3-12). A cell proliferation assay of the clones showed growth comparable with that of parental MDCK cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that overexpression of TSLC1 or any of the truncation mutants does not alter cell growth in MDCK cells (Fig. 1C). Both the Protein 4.1-BM and the PDZ-BM Are Necessary for the Lateral Localization of TSLC1 in Cysts Grown in a Three-dimensional Culture—We have previously reported that TSLC1 distributes to the lateral membrane of polarized cells on permeable supports (3Masuda M. Yageta M. Fukuhara H. Kuramochi M. Maruyama T. Nomoto A. Murakami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31014-31019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We tested whether deletion of the cytoplasmic domain or the conserved motifs affects its lateral localization. Except for punctate signals detected in the cytosol of the cells expressing the deletion mutants, all the truncated forms of TSLC1 were concentrated to the lateral surface of the cells, as seen in cells expressing the wild-type TSLC1 (Fig. 2). In the three-dimensional extracellular matrix, MDCK cells form hollow cysts that are lined by a monolayer of the cells (15O'Brien L.E. Zegers M.M. Mostov K.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). We embedded each of the clones in collagen I gel and found that all of them formed cysts that were morphologically indistinguishable from the one derived from the parental MDCK cell (Fig. 3 and 4, left columns). Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that TSLC1 was localized to the lateral membrane (Fig. 3, e and f), whereas ΔC-HA was detected diffusely in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, i and j), indicating that the truncation of the entire cytoplasmic domain abolished the lateral localization of TSLC1. Although a large fraction of Δ4.1-BM distributed to the lateral membrane, it was also detected in the apical side of the cytosol (Fig. 3, m and n). Intriguingly, deleting PDZ-BM shifted its localization from the lateral surface to the bottom third of the lateral membrane and the basal surfaces (Fig. 3, q and r). We have also stained the cysts for ZO-1, a marker of tight junctions, which is normally detected on the apical surfaces facing inwards of parental MDCK cysts (15O'Brien L.E. Zegers M.M. Mostov K.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In the cysts expressing the wild-type or truncated TSLC1, ZO-1 was detected as dots delineating the interior luminal free space of the cysts (Fig. 3, c, g, k, o, and s), indicating that expression of TSLC1 or any of the truncated mutants did not affect orientation of cell polarity.FIGURE 3Subcellular localization of the wild-type TSLC1 and the deletion mutants in a three-dimensional culture.

In collagen I gel, parental MDCK cells and the cells expressing GFP, TSLC1, ΔC-HA, Δ4.1-BM, or ΔPDZ-BM developed cysts in a similar size (Fig. 4, left column). The presence of Dox did not affect either the development of cysts from each clone (data not shown) or tubulogenesis of parental MDCK cells (Fig. 4, b and c). When cultured with HGF for 4 days, tubulogenesis was induced in parental MDCK and MDCK/GFP cysts (Fig. 4, b and e). In contrast, mature tubules were rarely observed in the MDCK/TSLC1 cysts (Fig. 4h), although magnified phase-contrast images revealed multiple short extensions from the basal membrane (Fig. 4h, inset). When TSLC1 expression was repressed with Dox in MDCK/TSLC1 cells, tubulogenesis reverted to the level comparable with that of the parental MDCK cells (Fig. 4i). Furthermore, MDCK/ΔC-HA, MDCK/Δ4.1-BM, and MDCK/ΔPDZ-BM cysts formed tubules in a size similar to that observed in parental MDCK cysts (Fig. 4, b, k, n, and q). Quantitative analysis of 30 cysts for each cell clone demonstrated that the difference in tubulogenesis between the Dox-treated (TSLC1 off) and untreated (TSLC1 on) MDCK/TSLC1 cells was statistically significant (p < 0.0001), whereas other cell clones showed no statistically significant difference between the Dox-treated and untreated cysts (p > 0.05) (Fig. 5). These findings indicate that TSLC1 expression, indeed, blocks HGF-induced tubulogenesis and that either of the cytoplasmic motifs is indispensable for the inhibitory effect. TSLC1 Inhibits HGF-induced Cell Scattering by Suppressing Induction of EMT—We next examined the effects of TSLC1 on HGF-induced cell scattering of MDCK cells. In the absence of HGF, all the cell clones formed small colonies on plastic two-dimensional substrata, which were morphologically indistinguishable from one another (Fig. 6, left column). The presence of Dox did not affect either the morphology of each clone (data not shown) or scattering of parental MDCK cells (Fig. 6, b and c). After a 17-h incubation with HGF, MDCK, MDCK/GFP, and MDCK/ΔC-HA cells exhibited a spindle-like fibroblastic morphology and scattered across a culture plate at a comparable level (Fig. 6, b, e, and k). On the other hand, the HGF-treated MDCK/TSLC1 cells did not dissociate from each other and showed flattened morphology (Fig. 6h) compared with the tightly compacted cobblestone-like morphology seen before adding HGF (Fig. 6g). When TSLC1 expression was repressed with Dox, MDCK/TSLC1 cells scattered (Fig. 6i) similar to the parental MDCK cells (Fig. 6c). HGF also induced scattering of MDCK/Δ4.1-BM and MDCK/ΔPDZ-BM cells (Fig. 6, n and q), although the degree of scattering in MDCK/Δ4.1-BM cells (Fig. 6n)was slightly lower than in parental MDCK cells (Fig. 6b). A quantitative analysis of cell scattering confirmed that the difference between the Dox-treated and untreated MDCK/TSLC1 cells was statistically significant with p < 0.0001. In contrast, other cell clones showed no significant difference between the Dox-treated and untreated cells (p > 0.05) (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Quantitative analysis of cell scattering. Cell scattering is presented as the percentage of isolated cells over the total number of cells in the phase-contrast images. Each bar represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate assays. The asterisk indicates statistical significance with p < 0.0001 as determined by the Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether molecular changes of EMT occurred in these cells, we examined localization of adherens junction (AJ) proteins and markers for mesenchymal cells in parental MDCK, MDCK/TSLC1, and MDCK/ΔC-HA cells after a 17-h incubation with or without HGF. In the absence of HGF, all the small colonies from each clone were stained for the AJ proteins, E-cadherin and β-catenin, at the cell-cell boundaries (Fig. 8A, b, c, g, h, l, and m), but not for the mesenchymal markers, vimentin and fibronectin (Fig. 8A, d, e, i, j, n, and o). In HGF-treated MDCK and MDCK/ΔC-HA cells, ΔC-HA (Fig. 8A, k′), E-cadherin (Fig. 8A, b′ and l′), and β-catenin (Fig. 8A, c′ and m′) disappeared from the cell membrane. Instead, these cells expressed vimentin (Fig. 8A, d′ and n′) and fibronectin (Fig. 8A, e′ and o′), reflecting that they underwent EMT. In contrast, HGF-treated MDCK/TSLC1 cells continued to express TSLC1 (Fig. 8A, f ′), E-cadherin (Fig. 8A, g′), and β-catenin (Fig. 8A, h′) at the cell-cell attached sites, but no mesenchymal marker (Fig. 8A, i′ and j′) was observed. We also tested the expression of these proteins by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 8B). Consistent with the results of immunofluorescence staining, expression of vimentin and fibronectin was induced in HGF-treated MDCK and MDCK/ΔC-HA cells but not in MDCK/TSLC1 cells (Fig. 8B). The expression of E-cadherin was reduced in HGF-treated MDCK and MDCK/ΔC-HA cells but not in HGF-treated MDCK/TSLC1 cells (Fig. 8B) indicating that MDCK/TSLC1 cells retained E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion even after being treated with HGF. These results suggest that TSLC1 abrogates the induction of EMT and maintains the epithelial phenotype in HGF-treated MDCK cells. Although the signal of β-catenin was not detected in either the HGF-treated MDCK (Fig. 8A, c′) or MDCK/ΔC-HA (Fig. 8A, m′) cells by immunostaining, the amount of β-catenin was not decreased in these cells by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 8B). β-Catenin has been reported to translocate from the membrane to the cytosol and/or nucleus when E-cadherin-based cell adhesion is disrupted (12Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5487) Google Scholar). This translocation is likely to have made the immunostaining signal of β-catenin weaker in our study. TSLC1 Modulates Rac and Rho Activities in HGF-treated MDCK Cells—The Rho family GTPases are well known key mediators of actin cytoskeletal rearrangements during HGF-induced cell scattering and tubulogenesis (17Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A previous study has demonstrated that, in MDCK cells on a tissue culture plate, HGF elicits transient immediate early activation of Rac and sustained activation of Rho, which is correlated with cell scattering response (18Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). With use of GST-RAK-RBD and GST-Rhotekin-RBD agarose beads, we confirmed that in response to HGF, the parental cells showed immediate early increase in Rac activity, which returned to basal levels within 15 min (Fig. 9A, left panel), as well as sustained Rho activation (Fig. 9B, left panel). In contrast, the HGF-treated MDCK/TSLC1 cells exhibited prolonged Rac activation, which was still observed 4 h after stimulation (Fig. 9A, middle panel), but there was no increase in Rho activity (Fig. 9B, middle panel). These results demonstrated that the expression of TSLC1 induces the prolonged activation of Rac and the reduced activation of Rho in HGF-stimulated MDCK cells. It is, therefore, conceivable that the ability of TSLC1 to block the HGF-triggered cell scattering may arise from its modulatory effects on Rac and Rho activities. The regulatory effect of TSLC1 on Rac activity appeared to depend upon its cytoplasmic domain because MDCK/ΔC-HA cells showed a profile of Rac activation (Fig. 9A, right panel) similar to that in parental MDCK cells (Fig. 9A, left panel). ΔC-HA, however, did not completely restore the sustained activation of Rho (Fig. 9B, right panel) to the level observed in parental MDCK cells (Fig. 9B, left panel). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of tumor and/or metastasis suppression by TSLC1, we investigated the effects of TSLC1 on EMT in MDCK-HGF models using a series of truncated mutants along with their subcellular localization. In a three-dimensional culture, but not in a two-dimensional culture, we found that both the protein 4.1-BM and the PDZ-BM were indispensable for the lateral localization of TSLC1. Because three-dimensional culture systems are known to resemble the in vivo environment more closely than two-dimensional culture systems (19Zegers M.M. O'Brien L.E. Yu W. Datta A. Mostov K.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 169-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), both the protein 4.1-BM and the PDZ-BM could play vital roles in the lateral localization of TSLC1 in human epithelium. Compared with the protein 4.1-BM, truncation of the PDZ-BM showed more striking effects on subcellular localization of TSLC1. Deleting the PDZ-BM shifted the localization from the lateral membrane to the basal surface of the MDCK cysts. The PDZ-BM of TSLC1 has been shown to interact with MAGuKs that act as molecular scaffolds (6Shingai T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Morimoto K. Takekuni K. Itoh S. Satoh K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Monden M.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6160-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The result raises the intriguing possibility that MAGuKs are involved in lateral targeting of TSLC1 or retention of TSLC1 in the lateral membrane. In MDCK-HGF models, we have demonstrated that expression of TSLC1 suppresses HGF-induced tubulogenesis and cell scattering and that either the protein 4.1-BM or the PDZ-BM is necessary for this inhibition. The inhibitory effect of tubulogenesis appeared to be correlated with the lateral localization of TSLC1 in cysts. HGF-induced tubulogenesis of MDCK cells proceeds through four distinct stages: (I) formation of extensions, (II) formation of single file cell chains, (III) conversion to multilayered cords, and (IV) maturation of tubules (19Zegers M.M. O'Brien L.E. Yu W. Datta A. Mostov K.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 169-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A number of thin extensions were observed in the HGF-stimulated MDCK/TSLC1 cysts by phase-contrast microscopy, implying that TSLC1 might exert its inhibitory effect at stage II. It has been suggested that partial EMT occurs during stage I and II to form extensions and chains (19Zegers M.M. O'Brien L.E. Yu W. Datta A. Mostov K.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 169-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). TSLC1 would, therefore, suppress the induction of EMT during HGF-induced tubulogenesis. HGF-induced cell scattering of MDCK cells is also subdivided into three major stages: (I) cell spreading, (II) dissociation of cells from each other, and (III) migration as individual cells. HGF-treated MDCK/TSLC1 cells showed flattened morphology but did not dissociate from each other, suggesting that TSLC1 might inhibit the process in stage II. Furthermore, we found that MDCK/TSLC1 cells continued to express AJ proteins at cell-cell boundaries, but not mesenchymal markers after stimulation with HGF. Consequently, TSLC1 expression could maintain an epithelial phenotype of MDCK cells by abrogating EMT induced by HGF. It has been suggested that Rac and Rho are involved in HGF-triggered cell scattering at different stages (14Kamei T. Matozaki T. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Yokoyama S. Peng Y.F. Nakano K. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6776-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Previous studies from others have shown that a constitutively active Rac mutant abolishes HGF-mediated scattering (17Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and high in Rac and low in Rho activities are correlated with an epithelial phenotype by stabilizing E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion (20Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 21Caron E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Consistent with these earlier reports, we observed high Rac and low Rho activities along with stabilization of cell-cell adhesion in the HGF-treated MDCK/TSLC1 cells. It seems, therefore, that TSLC1 abolishes HGF-induced EMT of MDCK cells by inducing sustained activation of Rac and low activity of Rho. Sequential analysis of Rac activity during HGF-induced MDCK cell scattering showed that a transient decrease in Rac activity seemed necessary to elicit cell-cell dissociation (22Palacios F. D'Souza-Schorey C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17395-17400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Given that a transient decrease in Rac activity is essential to induce disassembly of cell-cell junctions, prolonged Rac activation seen in the HGF-treated MDCK/TSLC1 cells may interfere with the process of cell dissociation, thereby inhibiting cell scattering. The regulatory effect of TSLC1 on Rac activity appeared to depend upon its cytoplasmic domain. In addition, the protein 4.1-BM and PDZ-BM, which both locate in the cytoplasmic domain, are indispensable for the inhibitory effects of TSLC1 on tubulogenesis and cell scattering. It is plausible, therefore, that proteins interacting with these motifs may be responsible for the prolonged Rac activation induced by TSLC1. We noted, however, that the HGF-treated ΔC-HA/MDCK cells did not show the prolonged Rho activation at the level observed in parental MDCK cells. This suggests that down-regulation of Rho activity caused by TSLC1 required another domain of TSLC1 besides its cytoplasmic domain. Epigenetic silencing of TSLC1 is frequently observed in advanced non-small cell lung cancer as well as in many other human cancers, reflecting its involvement in invasion and/or metastasis (2Kuramochi M. Fukuhara H. Nobukuni T. Kanbe T. Maruyama T. Ghosh H.P. Pletcher M. Isomura M. Onizuka M. Kitamura T. Sekiya T. Reeves R.H. Murakami Y. Nat.

Consistent with this, restoration of TSLC1 expression in TSLC1-deficient non-small cell lung cancer cells dramatically suppressed metastasis from the spleen to the liver in nude mice (9Yageta M. Kuramochi M. Masuda M. Fukami T. Fukuhara H. Maruyama T. Shibuya M. Murakami Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5129-5133PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, immunohistochemical studies of primary lung adenocarcinomas demonstrated that TSLC1-positive tumor cells tended to be less invasive (23Ito A. Okada M. Uchino K. Wakayama T. Koma Y. Iseki S. Tsubota N. Okita Y. Kitamura Y. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Uchino K. Ito A. Wakayama T. Koma Y. Okada T. Ohbayashi C. Iseki S.

Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All these observations suggest that the loss of TSLC1 is involved in EMT during tumor cell invasion and/or metastasis in various advanced human tumors. The present study in in vitro systems supports the idea that TSLC1 suppresses induction of EMT by modulating the activities of Rac and Rho. Investigations on how TSLC1 induces high Rac and low Rho activity in HGF-stimulated MDCK cells are now underway. It also should be noted that we did not detect the association between TSLC1 and the receptor for HGF, c-Met, by a coimmunoprecipitation assay (data not shown). Further studies will provide pivotal information toward understanding the signaling involved in the tumor-suppressive activity of TSLC1 and also may establish a mechanistic link between TSLC1, EMT, and tumor metastasis.

Tesshi Yamada and Kazufumi Honda and the members of the Chemotherapy Division of the National Cancer Research Institute for their generous help with the Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal system.

https://openalex.org/W2083871045,"Tyrosine phosphorylation is an important means of regulating ion channel function. Our previous gene expression studies using the Xenopus laevis oocyte system suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir3 or GIRK) suppressed basal channel conductance and accelerated channel deactivation. To assess whether similar mechanisms regulate Kir3 function in mammalian cells, we developed and characterized a phosphoselective antibody recognizing Kir3.1 phosphorylated at tyrosine 12 in the N-terminal domain and then probed for evidence of Kir3.1 phosphorylation in cultured mammalian cells and spinal cord. The antibody was found to discriminate between the phospho-Tyr12 of Kir3.1 and the native state in transfected cell lines and in primary cultures of mouse atria. Following either mouse hindpaw formalin injection or sciatic nerve ligation, pY12-Kir3.1 immunoreactivity was enhanced unilaterally in the superficial layers of the spinal cord dorsal horn, regions previously described as expressing Kir3.1 channels. Mice lacking K 3.1 following targeted gene disruption did not show specific pY12-Kir3.1 immunoreactivity after sciatic nerve ligation. Further, mice exposed to repeatedly forced swim stress showed bilateral enhancement in pY12-Kir3.1 in the dorsal horn. This study provides evidence that Kir3 tyrosine phosphorylation occurred during acute and chronic inflammatory pain and under behavioral stress. The reduction in Kir3 channel activity is predicted to enhance neuronal excitability under physiologically relevant conditions and may mediate a component of the adaptive physiological response. Tyrosine phosphorylation is an important means of regulating ion channel function. Our previous gene expression studies using the Xenopus laevis oocyte system suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir3 or GIRK) suppressed basal channel conductance and accelerated channel deactivation. To assess whether similar mechanisms regulate Kir3 function in mammalian cells, we developed and characterized a phosphoselective antibody recognizing Kir3.1 phosphorylated at tyrosine 12 in the N-terminal domain and then probed for evidence of Kir3.1 phosphorylation in cultured mammalian cells and spinal cord. The antibody was found to discriminate between the phospho-Tyr12 of Kir3.1 and the native state in transfected cell lines and in primary cultures of mouse atria. Following either mouse hindpaw formalin injection or sciatic nerve ligation, pY12-Kir3.1 immunoreactivity was enhanced unilaterally in the superficial layers of the spinal cord dorsal horn, regions previously described as expressing Kir3.1 channels. Mice lacking K 3.1 following targeted gene disruption did not show specific pY12-Kir3.1 immunoreactivity after sciatic nerve ligation. Further, mice exposed to repeatedly forced swim stress showed bilateral enhancement in pY12-Kir3.1 in the dorsal horn. This study provides evidence that Kir3 tyrosine phosphorylation occurred during acute and chronic inflammatory pain and under behavioral stress. The reduction in Kir3 channel activity is predicted to enhance neuronal excitability under physiologically relevant conditions and may mediate a component of the adaptive physiological response.

The molecular mechanisms regulating these activation processes, however, remain unclear. Using Xenopus laevis oocytes, our previous studies suggested that phosphorylation of N-terminal Kir3 tyrosine residues accelerated channel deactivation kinetics and inhibited basal potassium current amplitude (7Rogalski S.L.

Because Kir3 channels play an important role in regulating cardiac and neuronal signaling (1Dascal N. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2Torrecilla M.

Of the four Kir3 subtypes identified in mammals (Kir3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4), Kir3.1 is expressed in the greatest range of tissues, forming heterotetramers with other Kir3 subunits in heart, brain, and endocrine cells (1Dascal N. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Recent studies in mice with genetically ablated Kir3.1 have shown that Kir3 plays a role in attenuating opioid-mediated antinoci-ception by activating heterotetramers of Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (4Bettahi I. Marker C.L. Roman M.I. Wickman K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48282-48288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Marker C.L. Stoffel M. Wickman K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2806-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because tyrosine kinases are up-regulated and activated in animal models of spinally mediated acute and chronic pain (11Ji R.R. Strichartz G. Sci. STKE 2004. 2004; : reE14Google Scholar), it is reasonable to hypothesize that Kir3 may be phosphorylated at N-terminal tyrosine residues in response to these stimuli. To identify physiological stimuli promoting Kir3 tyrosine phosphorylation in the spinal cord, in this study we developed an antibody selective for Kir3.1 when phosphorylated at tyrosine 12 (hereafter pY12-Kir3.1), a residue located in the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain. After characterizing pY12-Kir3.1 specificity and phosphoselectivity in primary cardiac myocyte cultures and transfected cell lines, we evaluated phosphorylation of Tyr12-Kir3.1 in spinal cord slices from mice subjected to hindpaw formalin injection or sciatic nerve ligation, models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, respectively. We further investigated pY12-Kir3.1 in a mouse model of chronic stress to determine whether Kir3.1 Tyr12 phosphorylation occurred in the dorsal horn in response to stressful stimuli independently of nociception. This study provides evidence that Kir3.1 tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in response to nociceptive stimuli and physiological stress. DNA Clones—Plasmid vectors containing coding regions for Kir3.1 (GenBank™ U01071) were obtained from Dr. Henry Lester (California Institute of Technology). Kir3.1 was point-mutated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis to create Kir3.1[F137S] according to the manufacturer's specifications (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The F137S form of Kir3.1 was used because it expresses functional homotetramers in the absence of other Kir3 subunits, whereas Kir3.1 expressed alone is non-functional and gets trapped in Golgi (7Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was also used to mutate Tyr12 to Phe. Fluorescently tagged fusion proteins were created by cloning the construct into a pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA), which fused YFP to the Kir3.1 N terminus. Cell Lines—SH-SY5Y cells were a gift from Dr. Zhengui Xia (University of Washington). NIH-3t3 fibroblasts stably transfected with full-length trkB were a gift from Dr. Mark Bothwell (University of Washington). Chinese hamster ovary cells and AtT20 mouse pituitary cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained according to recommended protocols. Pharmacological Agents and Antibodies—BDNF was a gift from AMGEN Corporation. K252A was from Calbiochem. Concentrated stocks were made by dilution in Me2SO. Working aliquots were diluted such that Me2SO concentration did not exceed 0.1% of the final solution in cell culture experiments. Formalin was from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). Actin antibody was from Ab-Cam (Cambridge, MA). Unmodified Kir3.1 antibody was from Chemicon Corporation (Temecula, CA). Phospho-ERK antibody was from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Phalloidin-688 toxin was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Hydrogen peroxide concentration was determined by Amplex Red assays (Molecular Probes). Polyclonal Antibody Generation—A polypeptide-containing residues 1-17 (MSALRRKFGDDpYQVVTT) of rodent Kir3.1 phosphorylated at tyrosine residue 12 was generated by PeptidoGenic Research & Co, Inc. (Livermore, CA). The peptide was conjugated to KLH and injected into rabbits by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA). 500 μg of antigen peptide was combined with Complete Freund's Adjuvant for initial inoculation then animals received boost inoculations of 250 μg of antigen peptide on days 14, 21, 49, 56, and monthly thereafter. Bleeds (6-7 ml) were collected once per month. Affinity Purification—Columns were prepared by activating Sepharose 4B beads with 0.5 g of CNBr then conjugating 2-5 μmol of pY12-Kir3.1 peptide. Sera (3 ml) were added to the Sepharose beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Unbound protein was washed off resin in a 0.7 × 15 cm column using 20 ml of Tris (pH 7.4, 0.05 m) and NaCl (0.15 m), then antibody was eluted with 5 ml MgCl2 (5 m) in Tris (pH 7.4, 0.05 m) and NaCl (0.15 m) and concentrated using a Centriprep-30. Antibody aliquots were stored at -20 °C in 50% glycerol until use. ELISA Assay—96-well plates were incubated for 3 h in a 10 μg/ml solution (in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) of a peptide synthesized to correspond to either the first 17 residues of the native Kir3.1 N-terminal tail or the first 17 residues of Kir3.1 N-terminal tail, phosphorylated at tyrosine, position 12 (pY12-Kir3.1). Unbound antigen was rinsed from wells with 1× PBS/Tween 20 (0.05%). Wells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in blocking solution (1× PBS/Tween 20 (0.05%) and 3% bovine serum albumin), then overnight in increasing concentrations (triplicate) of purified pY12-Kir3.1 antibody. Wells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in IgG/alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) diluted 1:1000 in 1× PBS-Tween 20 (0.05%). Alkaline phosphatase was detected by 10 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.05 m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.8, with 1 m MgCl2). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 m NaOH. Absorbance was measured by spectrophotometer at 405 nm, and serum antibody titer was estimated based on absorbance reading plotted against dilution for each triplicate. Immunoblots—Seven days after nerve ligation or 40 min after formalin or saline injections, mice were killed by decapitation, and the spinal cord was dissected and placed on dry ice, then cut by scalpel into four longitudinal sections corresponding to dorsal/ventral horns, ipsilateral and contralateral to injection. Tissue was placed into 250 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (12Belcheva M.M. Szucs M. Wang D. Sadee W. Coscia C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33847-33853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and homogenized by Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were boiled for 2 min, sonicated 20 s to shear genomic DNA, and then centrifuged 10 min (14,000 × g, 4 °C). Protein concentration was determined by Pierce bicinchroninic assay (BCA) before loading 20 μg onto non-denaturing 10% bisacrylamide precast gels (Invitrogen) and running at 150 V for 1.5 h. Blots were transferred to nitrocellulose for 1.5 h at 30 V, blocked in 1× TBS/5% nonfat dry milk/0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h, incubated 8 h room temperature in 0.03 mg/ml pY12-Kir3.1 antibody and washed. Blots were incubated for 1 h in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Promega) before treating with chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and developing by Kodak Biomax x-ray film (Rochester, NY). Band intensity was quantified by scanning film and comparing average pixel intensity of each band to vehicle controls using NIH Image v1.61 software (Research Service Support Branch of the NIMH, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—NIH3t3-trkB or SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were plated onto coverslips and incubated in a 37 °C (5% CO2) incubator. After drug treatments, cells were washed once in PBS, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed, blocked 2 h in 0.3% gelatin/0.025% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature, incubated 1-3 days at 4 °C in 1.5 μg/ml primary affinity-purified pY12-Kir3.1 antibody or 1:100 phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), then incubated 2 h at room temperature in goat anti-rabbit rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:1000. Coverslips were viewed by Leica confocal microscopy. All quantitations were performed using Metamorph Imaging System software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downington, PA), in which plasma membranes were outlined, and the average pixel intensity of the defined region was determined. Quantifications were performed blind. Primary Mouse Cardiac Myocyte Cultures—Atria or ventricles were dissected from postnatal day 1-5 mouse pups, cut coarsely, digested in pancreatin (Sigma) and collagenase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) for 30 min at 37 °C then collected by centrifugation in fetal bovine serum (Sigma). After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C to allow unwanted fibroblasts to adhere to the plates, supernatant was collected, and cells were plated on coverslips coated with 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine. Cells were used within 48 h after culture for atrial myoctyes and 5-6 days after culture for ventricular myocytes. ICC was conducted as described above for NIH3t3 cell lines. Animals and Housing—Male C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) weighing 25-35 g, housed in the Animal Core Facility at the University of Washington in groups of two to four in plastic cages bedded with Bed-A-Cob, were used in these experiments. Kir3.1 knock-out mice, generated as described (4Bettahi I. Marker C.L. Roman M.I. Wickman K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48282-48288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), were backcrossed for nine generations against the C57BL/6 mouse strain. PCR of tail DNA samples was used to confirm null-mutation genotype. Animals were maintained in pathogen-free housing units illuminated on a 12 h light-dark cycle with artificial lights on at 7 AM. Food and water were available ad libitum. Protocols were approved by the University of Washington Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the 1996 National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and guidelines for the International Association for the Study of Pain (13Zimmermann M. Pain. 1983; 16: 109-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6753) Google Scholar). Veterinary staff inspected mice regularly to ensure compliance. Partial Sciatic Nerve Ligation (pSNL)—pSNL was used as a model of neuropathic pain (14Seltzer Z. Dubner R. Shir Y. Pain. 1990; 43: 205-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). The animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (intraperitoneal, 80 mg/kg). The right hind legs were cleaned with 70% ethanol. Using autoclaved/sterilized instruments, the right sciatic nerve was exposed, and ∼one-third to one-half of its diameter was tightly ligated using 7-0 silk suture (Surgical Specialties Corporation, Reading, PA). After checking hemostasis, the muscle and the adjacent fascia were closed with sutures, and the skin was closed with clips. The mice were euthanized with halothane when experiments were completed. Hindpaw Formalin Injection—The left hindpaw of wild-type C57Bl/6 mice was gently held and injected intraplantarly with saline or 4% formalin in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer using a 26.5-gauge needle. The mouse was returned to a clear cage for observation. Paw flinches and licks were counted during the acute (0-5 min) and tonic phases (10-40 min) of response to formalin treatment. Mice were deeply anesthetized by halothane inhalation and cardioperfused with 4% paraformaldehyde 40 min after injection for immunohistochemistry experiments, or killed by decapitation for Western blot analyses. Spinal Cord Immunohistochemistry—After cardioperfusion with paraformaldehyde, spinal cords were dissected and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for an additional 2 h, then transferred to a 30% sucrose solution and incubated for 1-2 days at 4 °C for cryoprotection. A microtome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) was used to cut 40-μm floating sections stored in phosphate buffer. Sections were rinsed three times in PBS then blocked in 4% goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100. After three more PBS rinses, sections were incubated 2 days in primary antibodies (1:100 pY12-Kir3.1, 1:1000 GFAP (Advanced Immunochemical, Inc., Long Beach, CA), 1:250 NeuN (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) diluted in blocking buffer, rinsed again in PBS, and then incubated in secondary antibodies (1:250 Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, 1:1000 donkey anti-guinea pig, 1:500 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Slices were mounted onto glass slides and dried overnight, then mounted with Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and coverslipped. Images were taken using an SP1 confocal microscope and image capturing software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Quantifications were performed blind using Metamorph Imaging System software (Universal Imaging Corporation) or NIH Image v1.61 software. Average pixel intensities within a region approximating laminae I-II of the spinal cord dorsal horn were calculated and normalized to a region of comparable area in the ventral horn. Forced Swim Stress—C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to a modified Porsolt forced swim stress as described previously (15McLaughlin J.P. Xu M. Mackie K. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34631-34640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Porsolt R.D. Le Pichon M. Jalfre M. Nature. 1977; 266: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice swam in a 30 °C water bath in a 2-day procedure with no opportunity to escape. On day 1, animals swam for 15 min. On day 2, mice swam for four intervals of 6 min separated by 7-12-min rest periods. Following each swim, mice were towel-dried and returned to their home cages. Exclusion criteria included difficulty in staying afloat; no mice met these criteria in this study. Statistics—Student's t tests were performed to determine statistical significance of results. p values <0.05 were used to define a significant difference between conditions. Generation of pY12-Kir3.1, an Antibody Recognizing Kir3.1, Phosphorylated at Tyrosine, Position 12—An antibody selective for Kir3.1 phosphorylated at tyrosine 12 within the N-terminal domain (pY12-Kir3.1) was generated in rabbits and affinity-purified. A peptide for the first 17 residues of Kir3.1 phosphorylated at position 12 was synthesized and conjugated to KLH (Fig. 1A), and rabbits were immunized to the conjugate by a schedule of injections as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Following monthly boosts with the peptide, antibodies to pY12-Kir3.1 were affinity-purified from the raw sera by a CNBr column conjugated to the pY12-Kir3.1 peptide. Antibody bound to the column was isolated, and its specificity for phosphorylated over unmodified peptide was verified by ELISA assay. The affinity-purified antisera preferentially bound to the phosphorylated pY12-Kir3.1 peptide (first 17 amino acids) over the peptide in the native state (Fig. 1B). These results suggest specificity of affinity-purified pY12-Kir3.1 for Kir3.1 phosphorylated at tyrosine 12. We confirmed the expression of Kir3.1 in cultured SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells differentiated 10 days with 10 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) by immunoblot analysis using a commercially available, non-phosphoselective antibody to Kir3.1 (data not shown). Treatment of cultures for 15 min with 4.5 mm hydrogen peroxide, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor and activator of non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src (17Takano T. Sada K. Yamamura H. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), resulted in enhanced pY12-Kir3.1 immunoreactivity (IR) (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting both phosphoselectivity and specificity for Kir3.1. The peroxide-enhanced pY12-Kir3.1-IR in SH-SY5Y cells was prolonged by subsequent incubation of SH-SY5Y cells in the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor phenylarsine oxide (PAO, 20 μm) (TABLE ONE), again suggesting antibody phosphosensitivity.TABLE ONETyrosine phosphatase inhibition by phenylarsine oxide (20 μm) prolongs hydrogen peroxide-mediated enhancement of pY12-Kir3.1-IR in SH-SY5Y cellsTime after hydrogen peroxide treatmentTreatment after hydrogen peroxide removedaData representative of two independent experiments.VehiclePAOmin−1522 ± 2 (10)bMean pixel intensity ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab These results were confirmed in AtT20 cells, a mouse pituitary tumor cell line endogenously expressing Kir3.1 (Ref. 18Celver J. Xu M. Jin W. Lowe J. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, and data not shown). Further, peroxide treatment had no effect on pY12-Kir3.1-IR in CHO cells (data not shown), a cell line that does not endogenously express Kir3.1 (19Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To extend these results to native tissues, we cultured atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes from day 1-5 mouse pups and examined pY12-Kir3.1-IR (Fig. 2, A and B). Atria endogenously express Kir3.1, whereas ventricular myocytes express substantially less Kir3.1 protein (1Dascal N. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). pY12-Kir3.1-IR was very low in vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Treating atrial myocytes with increasing doses of hydrogen peroxide resulted in enhanced pY12-Kir3.1-IR as determined by confocal microscopy and image analysis using Metamorph software (TABLE TWO).TABLE TWOpY12-Kir3.1-IR in hydrogen peroxide-treated atrial myocytesDose hydrogen peroxidepY12-Kir3.1 IRmm0.00 ± 0 (10)aMean pixel intensity ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab To exclude the possibility that the hydrogen peroxide-induced enhancement pY12-Kir3.1-IR was a result of apoptosis, we preincubated SH-SY5Y cells or atrial myocytes in 50-500 μm anisomycin for 15 min prior to fixation and immunostaining with pY12-Kir3.1. Both hydrogen peroxide and anisomycin activate comparable pro-apoptotic signaling cascades at 15-min post-treatment, including p38 MAPK and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), but anisomycin is not associated with Src activation and tyrosine phosphatase inhibition (20Wang X.

Supporting the antibody specificity for tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling events, anisomycin pretreatment did not increase pY12-Kir3-IR in ATRA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells or atrial myocytes (TABLE THREE).TABLE THREEpY12-Kir3.1-IR in SHSY5Y cells and a trial myocytes after anisomycin treatmentCell typeVehicleAnisomycinpY12-Kir3.1 IRDosepY12-Kir3.1 IRμmSH-SY5Y20 ± 2 (9)aMean pixel intensity ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activation of trkB receptor is a more physiologically relevant stimulus, and previous results suggested that trkB activation by BDNF could modulate Kir3 signaling (7Rogalski S.L.

Thus, we investigated whether pY12-Kir3.1-IR was elevated following trkB activation in NIH-3t3 fibroblasts stably transfected with full-length trkB, then transiently transfected with YFP-tagged constructs of Kir3.1[F137S] or Kir3.1[F137S/Y12F]. The single point mutation in the pore region allows the channel to traffic normally and function as a homomeric channel (23Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Expression of the YFP-tagged channels occurred throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A), in concurrence with previously published literature indicating Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum as well as plasma membrane expression of these channels (24Ma D. Zerangue N. Raab-Graham K. Fried S.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2002; 33: 715-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To verify functional trkB in these NIH-3t3 cells, we fixed cells at 2-, 5-, 15-, and 30-min post-BDNF treatment (0.2 μg/ml, 15 min) and immunostained for phospho-ERK1/2, one of the first signaling events observed following BDNF activation of trkB (25Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). In accordance with previously published reports (25Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev.

Most restriction endonucleases require dimerization to cleave both strands of DNA. We found that Mva1269I is a monomer both in solution and upon binding of cognate DNA. Protein fold-recognition analysis revealed that Mva1269I comprises two “PD-(D/E)XK” domains. The N-terminal domain is related to the 5′-GAATTC-3′-specific restriction endonuclease EcoRI, whereas the C-terminal one resembles the nonspecific nuclease domain of restriction endonuclease FokI. Inactivation of the C-terminal catalytic site transformed Mva1269I into a very active bottom strand-nicking enzyme, whereas mutants in the N-terminal domain nicked the top strand, but only at elevated enzyme concentrations. We found that the cleavage of the bottom strand is a prerequisite for the cleavage of the top strand. We suggest that Mva1269I evolved the ability to recognize and to cleave its asymmetrical target by a fusion of an EcoRI-like domain, which incises the bottom strand within the target, and a FokI-like domain that completes the cleavage within the nonspecific region outside the target sequence. Our results have implications for the molecular evolution of restriction endonucleases, as well as for perspectives of engineering new restriction and nicking enzymes with asymmetric target sites.

Type II restriction enzymes (REases) 5The abbreviations used are: REaserestriction endonucleasewtwild-typeFRfoldrecognitionBSAbovine serum albuminaaamino acid(s)SCsupercoiledOCopen-circle.5The abbreviations used are: REaserestriction endonucleasewtwild-typeFRfoldrecognitionBSAbovine serum albuminaaamino acid(s)SCsupercoiledOCopen-circle. are one of the largest groups of endonucleases. They recognize short double-stranded DNA sequences and specifically cleave both strands of DNA at fixed positions within or near these sites (1Roberts R.J. Belfort M. Bestor T. Bhagwat A.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), a property that has made them indispensable for DNA engineering. All structurally characterized REases have been found to share a common three-dimensional fold harboring a bipartite PD-Xn-(D/E)XK pattern of three moderately conserved charged catalytic/Mg2+ binding residues (2Bujnicki J.M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2003; 4: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3Pingoud A. Fuxreiter M. Pingoud V. Wende W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 685-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, their amino acid sequences are strongly divergent. Typically, only enzymes that recognize identical or very similar DNA sequences may display similarity at the amino acid level (4Pingoud V. Sudina A. Geyer H. Bujnicki J.M. Lurz R. Luder G. Morgan R.

Recent bioinformatics analyses suggested that REases belong also to at least three other folds, GIY-YIG, HNH, and PLD (5Aravind L. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V.

Therefore, identification of the catalytic and DNA recognition residues of REases is extremely challenging. restriction endonuclease wild-type foldrecognition bovine serum albumin amino acid(s) supercoiled open-circle. restriction endonuclease wild-type foldrecognition bovine serum albumin amino acid(s) supercoiled open-circle. Most of type II REases (type IIP) recognize palindromic DNA sequences and cleave both DNA strands within the target at symmetrical positions. They usually act as homodimers, in which each of two identical subunits interacts symmetrically with the same part of the DNA sequence (3Pingoud A. Fuxreiter M. Pingoud V. Wende W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 685-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Type II REases that recognize asymmetric targets are classified as type IIA (8Roberts R.J. Vincze T. Posfai J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Of these, there are nine prototypes that cleave both DNA strands within the recognition sequence. Two of them, BbvCI and Bpu10I, have been characterized (9Heiter D.F. Lunnen K.D. Wilson G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Stankevicius K. Lubys A. Timinskas A. Vaitkevicius D. Janulaitis A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1084-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Both enzymes are composed of two mutually homologous, but non-identical subunits. This feature suggests that Bpu10I and BbvCI recognize and cleave DNA in an “almost symmetrical” manner, reminiscent of type IIP REases. Type IIS REases are those type IIA enzymes that cleave at least one strand of the DNA duplex outside of the recognition sequence (1Roberts R.J. Belfort M. Bestor T. Bhagwat A.S. Bickle T.A. Bitinaite J. Blumenthal R.M. Degtyarev S Kh., Dryden D.T.F. Dybvig K. Firman K. Gromova E.S. Gumport R.I. Halford S.E. Hattman S. Heitman J. Hornby D.P. Janulaitis A. Jeltsch A. Josephsen J. Kiss A.

This group of enzymes can be further subdivided based on the distance between the recognized sequence and the site of cleavage. One subgroup, represented by an archetypal REase, FokI, includes those type IIS enzymes that cleave both DNA strands distant from the target site. FokI comprises two physically and functionally distinct domains, one for DNA binding and another for catalysis, which are connected by a linker (11Wah D.A. Hirsch J.A. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1997; 388: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Initially, FokI binds to DNA as a monomer via the DNA binding domain. In the presence of divalent metal ions, the catalytic domains of two FokI monomers transiently dimerize and then cleave the DNA at a fixed position near one of the recognition sites (12Bitinaite J. Wah D.A. Aggarwal A.K. Schildkraut I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10570-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 13Vanamee E.S. Santagata S. Aggarwal A.K. J. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 10564-10569Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). FokI dimerization is necessary for efficient double-stranded DNA cleavage, because mutants defective in dimerization exhibit impaired DNA cleavage (12Bitinaite J. Wah D.A. Aggarwal A.K. Schildkraut I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10570-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It is likely that other REases of this subgroup could act in a similar manner (15Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Soundararajan M. Chang Z. Morgan R.D. Heslop P. Connolly B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although some of them can efficiently cleave one strand of cognate DNA. Their dimerization is only required to carry out the cleavage of the second DNA strand (17Higgins L.S. Besnier C. Kong H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2492-2501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Xu Y. Lunnen K.D. Kong H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12990-12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The other subgroup of type IIS enzymes, “short-distance” cutters, includes REases that cleave both DNA strands very close to the recognition site. Due to spatial constraints provided by the proximity of the DNA target sequence and the position where the cleavage occurs, it seems doubtful that the FokI-like DNA recognition and cleavage mechanism is applicable to these short-distance REases. Indeed, kinetic studies by Bath et al. (15Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and experiments aimed at developing nicking enzymes from representatives of this group of enzymes (19Samuelson J.C. Zhu Z. Xu S.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3661-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Zhu Z. Samuelson J.C. Zhou J. Dore A. Xu S.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) suggested that short-distance REases may possess two active sites. However, this possibility was never studied in detail. The type IIS REase from Micrococcus varians RFL1269, Mva1269I, is a short-distance cutter that recognizes an asymmetric DNA sequence 5′-GAATGCN↓-3′/5′-NG↓CATTC-3′ and cuts top and bottom DNA strands at positions indicated by arrows. 6A.

Butkus, personal communication. Reaction products have 3′-overhangs that are two nucleotides long. In this work, we investigated the DNA cleavage mechanism and sequence-structure-function relationships of Mva1269I using bioinformatics and biochemical analysis. Our experiments indicate that Mva1269I is a monomeric enzyme possessing two active sites responsible for the sequential cleavage of each DNA strand, which has evolved by fusion of a sequence-specific nuclease domain, similar to EcoRI, to a nonspecific nuclease domain, similar to FokI. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Reagents—Micrococcus varians RFL1269 was obtained from the Fermentas UAB collection. Escherichia coli strain ER2267 (New England Biolabs) was used as a host in cloning experiments. ER2566 (New England Biolabs) and pET-21b(+) (Novagen) were used for overexpression of Mva1269I. All strains were grown in LB medium at 37 °C according to standard protocols (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). Transformations of E. coli cells were carried out either by using the CaCl2-heat shock method or by electroporation (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). All enzymes, kits, standard sequencing primers, molecular mass standards, λ, and pUC57 DNAs were from Fermentas UAB. To construct the Mva1269I target-deficient plasmid pUCΔMva, pUC57 DNA was linearized with Mva1269I, and cohesive DNA ends were blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase and religated. The substrate with two Mva1269I sites, pUC57-2, was constructed as follows. The DNA of pUC57 was linearized with AatII, cohesive ends blunt-ended, and the resulting fragment ligated with a synthetic DNA duplex identical in sequence to the multiple cloning site of pUC57 (nucleotide coordinates 401-436) and containing the Mva1269I target in the middle. The insertion was verified by sequencing. The plasmids used in DNA cleavage studies were purified by centrifugation in CsCl-ethidium bromide. DNA Manipulations—Recombinant plasmid construction, restriction mapping, construction of nested deletions, agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern hybridization, and purification of DNA were carried out using standard techniques (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence was determined using the Cycle Reader™ DNA Sequencing Kit and standard 5′-end-labeled M13/pUC sequencing primers. Genomic DNA from Micrococcus varians RFL1269 was extracted and purified as described previously (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). Details on the construction of the M. varians RFL1269 gene library, isolation of clones carrying the cloned gene for Mva1269I methyltransferase, and subsequent cloning of the full-length gene for Mva1269I REase are available upon request. Expression and Purification of wt Mva1269I and Its Mutant Variants—To protect the DNA of ER2566 in vivo from Mva1269I REase, the gene for Mva1269I methyltransferase was subcloned into pACYC184 (22Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid rendered genomic DNA resistant to Mva1269I cleavage. Then, the gene for Mva1269I REase was inserted into pET-21b(+) under the control of the isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible phage T7 promoter, and introduced into methylation-proficient ER2566 cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of Mva1269I was performed by the “megaprimer” method (23Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the desired mutations, as well as the absence of additional mutations, was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Details on the construction of all aforementioned clones are available upon request. To purify wt Mva1269I and its mutant variants, cultures were grown to 0.5 A (λ = 550 nm) and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h at 37°C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 7 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl. The cell suspension was sonicated, and then cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The extract was subjected to column chromatography (successively, heparin-Sepharose, DEAE-52 cellulose, Bordo-Sepharose, and P11-phosphocellulose sorbents) using NaCl gradient. Fractions with Mva1269I activity were dialyzed against storage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.025% Triton X-100), and stored at -20 °C. Mva1269I mutants lacking the double-stranded cleavage activity were purified using the same scheme. However, in this case samples of individual fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and those fractions that contained the abundant protein band corresponding to that of the wild-type enzyme were pooled. The final preparations of all proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, scanned, and quantified using 1dwiniv software to verify their purity. Concentrations of purified proteins were estimated using the Bradford assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxynucleotides—The oligodeoxynucleotide sequences designed for the top strand of double-stranded DNA substrates for Mva1269I were: S1, 5′-GGCGATCGAATGCTTAGAAGGGTT-3′ (Mva1269I target underlined); PTO1, 5′-GGCGATCGAATGCTsTAGAAGGGTT-3′ (s denotes the position of phosphorothioate substitution); and N1, 5′-GGCGATCCATTTCTTAGAAGGGTT-3′ (no Mva1269I target). The sequences of the oligodeoxynucleotides used for the bottom strand were: S2, 5′-CCCTTCTAAGCATTCGATCG-3′; PTO2, 5′-CCCTTCTAAGsCATTCGATCG-3′; and N2, 5′-CCCTTCTAAGAAATGGATCG-3′. All high purity, salt-free oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech. Phosphorothioate-substituted oligonucleotides were supplied as a racemic mixture of Rp and Sp diastereomers. They were used without further purification. Concentrations of oligonucleotides were evaluated spectrophotometrically. For the DNA-binding experiments and cleavage assays, either top or the bottom strands of the duplexes were 5′-labeled with [γ-33P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) by using T4 polynucleotide kinase. To ensure that all labeled oligonucleotides are hybridized to the duplex, the unlabeled complementary oligonucleotides were used in slight excess (with a ratio of 1:1.2). Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed by heating the solution to 95 °C in a water bath and then allowed to cool slowly. Non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by radioactivity detection, showed no detectable traces of unhybridized radiolabeled single-stranded oligonucleotides. DNA Cleavage Assay I: Cleavage of One-site (pUC57) and Two-site (pUC57-2) Substrates by Mva1269I—Cleavage reactions were performed at 25 °C with 5 nm supercoiled plasmid DNA in Buffer R (Fermentas UAB, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1.5 μm BSA) and 0.4 nm Mva1269I. Aliquots were removed at timed intervals, and the cleavage reactions were stopped by adding 0.3 volume of gel loading buffer (60 mm EDTA, 0.3% SDS, 60% glycerol, 0.012% bromphenol blue). The reaction products were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. The stained gels were scanned, and DNA bands were quantified using 1dwiniv software. DNA Cleavage Assay II: Cleavage of One-site Substrate pUC57 by Mva1269I Mutants—Cleavage reactions were performed at 37 °C with 2.5 nm supercoiled plasmid DNA in Buffer R and Mva1269I variants at the concentrations indicated. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.3 volume of gel loading buffer (see above). The reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA Cleavage Assay III: Cleavage of Oligoduplexes by Mva1269I—Cleavage reactions with unmodified (S1/S2) and phosphorothioate-modified (S1/PTO2, PTO1/S2, or PTO1/PTO2) oligoduplexes (5 nm, 5′-33P-labeled on either of the strands) and Mva1269I (20 nm) were performed in Buffer R at 25 °C. Aliquots were removed at timed intervals, and the cleavage reactions were stopped by adding 0.5 volume of stop solution (95% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol FF, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Before loading, reaction samples were denatured for 5 min at 96 °C and cooled in ice. The reaction products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (20% acrylamide, 1× TBE (8.9 mm Tris, 8.9 mm boric acid, 0.2 mm EDTA), 7 m urea). Radio-labeled DNA was detected and quantified by using Cyclone Storage Phosphor System and OptiQuant 3.0 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA Binding Assays—DNA binding by wt Mva1269I and by mutant proteins was analyzed by the electrophoretic mobility-shift assay, using the 24-bp specific (*S1/S2) or nonspecific (*N1/N2) oligoduplexes (the asterisk denotes the 5′-33P-labeled oligonucleotide). To investigate the effect of Ca2+ ions on the DNA-binding properties of the wt enzyme, the duplexes (1 nm) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with varying amounts of the wt enzyme in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm KCl, 3 μm BSA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) supplemented either with 10 mm CaCl2 or with 0.1 mm EDTA. Samples were loaded onto 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (29:1 (w/w) acrylamide/bisacrylamide) and run at 6 V/cm in 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.5) buffer, which was supplemented with 10 mm calcium acetate in those cases when calcium ions were used in the DNA-binding reaction. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and analyzed using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System with OptiQuant 3.0 software. DNA-binding properties of mutant enzymes were examined in the presence of Ca2+ ions. In DNA displacement experiments, the radiolabeled *S1/S2 duplex (1 nm) was mixed with Mva1269I (2 nm) in binding buffer supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Then, varying amounts of an unlabeled 174-bp DNA fragment, containing a single site for Mva1269I, were added. The mixtures were analyzed by non-denaturing PAGE as above. The 174-bp DNA fragment was generated by PCR using pUC57 as a template, standard M13/pUC direct and reverse primers, followed by gel purification. Determination of Strand Specificity—pUC57 DNA was nicked with the appropriate Mva1269I mutant at 37 °C. The nicked form was then gel-purified and used as a template for run-off sequencing. The standard M13/pUC primers and BigDye® Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) were used in sequencing reactions. Sucrose Gradient Velocity Centrifugation—Mva1269I (485 nm), either alone or together with marker proteins, in a total volume of 250 μl, was layered on a 12-ml 5 to 20% (w/w) linear sucrose concentration gradient in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm CaCl2. The test tubes were then centrifuged at 20 °C in an SW 41Ti rotor using a Beckman L8 -70 ultracentrifuge at 40,000 rpm for 19 h. After centrifugation, 300-μl fractions were taken starting from the top and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The REase activity was detected by adding cofactor Mg2+ ions and λ DNA as a substrate. The following marker proteins were used: chymotrypsinogen (Mr 25,000), ovalbumin (Mr 43,000), bovine serum albumin (Mr 66,000), and aldolase (Mr 158,000). Centrifugation experiments of Mva1269I-DNA complexes were performed essentially as above, except that 485 nm of protein was combined either with a DNA mixture containing 4 nm of radioactively labeled and 960 nm of unlabeled oligoduplex S1/S2 (protein:DNA ratio, 1:2), or with a mixture of DNA containing 4 nm labeled and 1920 nm unlabeled oligoduplex S1/S2 (protein:DNA ratio, 1:4). To investigate the sedimentation of free DNA, the same volume (250 μl) of a DNA mixture containing 4 nm labeled and 1920 nm unlabeled oligoduplex S1/S2 was centrifuged. To detect radioactively labeled DNA, aliquots of fractions were spotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and dried samples were analyzed using Cyclone Storage Phosphor System and Opti-Quant 3.0 software. Protein Structure Prediction—Secondary structure prediction and tertiary fold-recognition (FR, recognition of similarity to known protein structures without significant sequence identity) was carried out via the GeneSilico meta-server at genesilico.pl/meta/(25Kurowski M.A. Bujnicki J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3305-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Because the FR procedure is designed to identify similarities at the level of individual protein domains, we carried out the initial analysis by dividing the Mva1269I sequence into a set of overlapping fragments corresponding to the size of typical domains (∼250 amino acids). FR alignments to the structures of selected templates were used as a starting point for homology modeling using the “FRankenstein's Monster” approach (26Kosinski J. Cymerman I.A. Feder M. Kurowski M.A. Sasin J.M. Bujnicki J.M. Proteins. 2003; 53: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), comprising cycles of model building, evaluation, realignment in poorly scored regions, and merging of best scoring fragments. Regions, which could not be modeled because of the lack of the appropriate template structure, were added “de novo” using the fragment insertion method ROSETTA (27Simons K.T. Kooperberg C. Huang E. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). This procedure has led to successful predictions of numerous protein structures (validated by experimental analyses; e.g. see the results of the CASP6 evaluation available at predictioncenter.llnl.gov/casp6/), including those of REases and other nucleases (e.g. 28Chmiel A.A.

Mva1269I Restriction-modification System Consists of Two Genes—Cloning and sequencing of the M. varians RFL1269 DNA region coding for the Mva1269I REase and methyltransferase revealed that the Mva1269I restriction-modification system consists of two convergently transcribed genes, which are separated by 125 bp (GenBank™ accession number DQ074451). The mva1269IR gene codes for the Mva1269I REase of 685 amino acid residues (calculated Mr 78,400). Mva1269I shares 31% amino acid sequence identity with its isoschizomer BsmI (GenBank™ accession number AY079085). The mva1269IM gene encodes the M.Mva1269I methyltransferase of 626 amino acid residues (calculated Mr 72,597). Sequence analysis revealed that M.Mva1269I is composed of two modules exhibiting significant sequence similarity to DNA methyltransferases that generate either m4Corm6A (32Timinskas A. Butkus V. Janulaitis A. Gene. 1995; 157: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). DNA Cleavage by Mva1269I—Studies of DNA cleavage by BsmI, an isoschizomer of Mva1269I, demonstrated that the enzyme cleaved substrates with one and two recognition sites at similar rates and cleaved the two-site DNA by acting independently at each site (15Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the authors suggested that BsmI does not need to interact with two target sites and that it probably is a monomer with two active sites, one for the cleavage of each DNA strand. To test if Mva1269I performs like BsmI, the cloned mva1269IR gene was overexpressed and Mva1269I purified. The enzyme was found to be >90% pure based on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). DNA cleavage experiments were carried out by using the supercoiled (SC) form of plasmids with one site (pUC57) and two sites (pUC57-2) as substrates. Like BsmI, Mva1269I linearized (Fig. 2A, see the curve L) the SC form of pUC57 without the accumulation of a nicked intermediate (Fig. 2A, see the curve OC). Hence, the cleavage of both DNA strands is highly concerted and Mva1269I does not dissociate from the target during the reaction. In the course of the incubation of Mva1269I with the two-site plasmid the initial accumulation of the full-length linear DNA form (Fig. 2B, the curve L) was followed by cleavage of the remaining site (Fig. 2B, the curve L1/2). Therefore, it appears that the two cleavage reactions are separate and sequential. Also, the initial rates of supercoiled DNA cleavage were similar irrespective of the number of Mva1269I targets (0.63 nm/min and 0.66 nm/min for one- and two-site substrates, respectively). This is in sharp contrast with the cleavage mode of the best studied type IIS representative, FokI, and of several other type IIS enzymes, most of which require two sites for optimal performance (15Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The DNA cleavage properties of Mva1269I are very similar to those of BsmI, BsmBI, BsaI, and SapI, all of which are short-distance cutters (15Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we carried out experiments aimed to understand how Mva1269I and, by indication, other short-distance REases recognize specific DNA and perform double-stranded DNA cleavage.

https://openalex.org/W1983089355,"Equilibrium as well as pre-steady-state measurements were performed to characterize the molecular basis of DNA binding and nucleotide incorporation by the thermostable archaeal DinB homologue (Dbh) DNA polymerase of Sulfolobus solfataricus. Equilibrium titrations show a DNA binding affinity of about 60 nm, which is ∼10-fold lower compared with other DNA polymerases. Investigations of the binding kinetics applying stopped-flow and pressure jump techniques confirm this weak binding affinity. Furthermore, these measurements suggest that the DNA binding occurs in a single step, diffusion-controlled manner. Single-turnover, single dNTP incorporation studies reveal maximal pre-steady-state burst rates of 0.64, 2.5, 3.7, and 5.6 s-1 for dTTP, dATP, dGTP, and dCTP (at 25 °C), which is 10-100-fold slower than the corresponding rates of classical DNA polymerases. Another unique feature of the Dbh is the very low nucleotide binding affinity (Kd ∼600 μm), which again is 10-20-fold lower compared with classical DNA polymerases as well as other Y-family polymerases. Surprisingly, the rate-limiting step of nucleotide incorporation (correct and incorrect) is the chemical step (phosphoryl transfer) and not a conformational change of the enzyme. Thus, unlike replicative polymerases, an “induced fit” mechanism to select and incorporate nucleotides during DNA polymerization could not be detected for Dbh.

Thus, unlike replicative polymerases, an “induced fit” mechanism to select and incorporate nucleotides during DNA polymerization could not be detected for Dbh. Polymerases involved in genome replication accomplish their task with high fidelity, ensuring genome stability. The low error rate in the range of 10-3 to 10-5 per base insertion can be augmented down to 10-7 by an intrinsic exonucleolytic proofreading strategy (1Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 2Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 3Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). However, these DNA replicases are not able to cope with certain DNA lesions (e.g. cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers resulting from UV damage), which represent a road block and would cause the entire replication machinery to stall. Thus, to ensure survival, all three kingdoms of life have evolved a complicated machinery, also known as translesion synthesis or lesion bypass, to overcome such blocks. In recent years, specialized DNA polymerases (Y-family polymerases) (4Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A. Lawrence C.W. Livneh Z. Nohmi T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Todo T. Walker G.C. Wang Z. Woodgate R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 7-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) have been discovered as the main components of this complex repair system (for a review, see Refs. 5Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 17-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar and 6Rattray A.J. Strathern J.N. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 31-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although many aspects of the translesion synthesis phenomenon are not yet fully understood, there has been tremendous progress in the last few years. In vitro studies indicate that Y-family polymerases are particularly distributive enzymes accompanied by a remarkably high error rate in the range of 10-2 to 10-3. This low fidelity is due to a loose polymerase active site and lack of fidelity-checking mechanisms (for a recent review, see Ref. 7Yang W. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that their ability to bypass lesions is at the cost of low fidelity. This in turn suggests that they have to be strictly regulated in order to prevent damage to the cell. There is growing evidence that these polymerases are recruited by the replication machinery through interactions with proliferating cell nuclear antigen in eukaryotes (8Vidal A.E. Kannouche P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48360-48368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or corresponding structures in other organisms (9Bunting K.A. Roe S.M. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5883-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) to bypass lesions during DNA synthesis (for a recent review, see Ref. 10Lehmann A.R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of three nonhuman Y-family DNA polymerase members, the N-terminal catalytic domain of yeast DNA polymerase η and Solfolobus solfataricus (P1 and P2, respectively) DNA polymerases Dbh (DinB homologue) and Dpo4 (DNA polymerase IV), the latter crystallized in a ternary complex with DNA and an incoming nucleotide, reveal that these proteins have a high degree of structural homology (11Trincao J.

Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). As seen for classical polymerases, these enzymes resemble a right-hand shape consisting of palm, fingers, and thumb domains. In addition, a unique but variable little finger domain is found. Deduced from the ternary Dpo4-DNA-nucleotide complex, the Y-family polymerases generally adopt a very open conformation, with the DNA substrate being solvent exposed near the active site and only a few contacts with the replicating base pair. As a consequence, the active site is rather spacious, enabling the enzymes to accommodate all kinds of distortions in the DNA template. However, each Y-family polymerase member differs in substrate specificity and as a result is specialized for a particular DNA lesion. It is assumed that the little finger domain plays a crucial role in defining catalytic properties and substrate specificity (15Boudsocq F. Kokoska R.J. Plosky B.S. Vaisman A. Ling H. Kunkel T.A. Yang W. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32932-32940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here we used the Dbh DNA polymerase of S. solfataricus P1 as a model system to examine the molecular mechanism of the DNA polymerization reaction of Y-family DNA polymerases, which are universal to Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. It should be noted that a recent reexamination concerning the origin of sequence of the dbh-containing fragment used for cloning of the recombinant enzyme (16Kulaeva O.I. Koonin E.V. McDonald J.P. Randall S.K. Rabinovich N. Connaughton J.F. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 357: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) indicates a perfect match with the genomic sequence from S. acidocaldarius (15Boudsocq F. Kokoska R.J. Plosky B.S. Vaisman A. Ling H. Kunkel T.A. Yang W. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32932-32940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Dbh therefore originates most likely from S. acidocaldarius and not S. solfataricus P1 as was originally thought. Nonetheless, in order to comply with recent literature, we will refer to it as S. solfataricus. The apoenzyme structure of Dbh suggests that the fingers domain is already in the “closed” active conformation instead of an “open” inactive conformation, as compared with the A and B family polymerases (12Zhou B.L. Pata J.D. Steitz T.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This assumption is supported by homology modeling studies with the Dpo4 ternary complex (17Yang W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this study, we report on steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic analyses, aiming to unravel mechanistic details of DNA binding and nucleotide incorporation by the Y-family Dbh polymerase. For the first time, we provide experimental evidence that nucleotide insertion and misinsertion by Dbh do not follow an induced “fit mechanism,” indicating a polymerase pathway different from that observed with classical DNA polymerases as well as with other Y-family polymerases. Protein—Full-length Dbh was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5 liters of LB medium, induced at an A600 of 0.7 by adding 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and harvested after 4 h. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES (NaOH), pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm EDTA) and lysed by sonication with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added. The lysate was then precipitated after heating the solution to 85 °C for 5 min to denature the host cell proteins. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap SP-Sepharose column (5 ml; Amersham Biosciences) and eluted via a NaCl gradient. The Dbh-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). A further purification step included a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), yielding 99% pure protein. Enzyme concentration was routinely determined using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 19,200 m-1 cm-1 in buffer C (6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5). Protein Labeling—150 μl of a 80 μm protein solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 50 mm NaCl) were mixed with 8 μl of a freshly prepared tetramethylrhodamine (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) solution (30 mm tetramethylrhodamine in dimethylsolfoneoxide). The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark. Excess dye was removed by gel filtration applying a 30-ml Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 1 m NaCl). To determine the protein concentration and the labeling efficiency, the absorption at 280 and 541 nm was measured. The labeling efficiency was ∼90%. Buffers—All experiments were carried out at 25 °C, unless otherwise indicated, in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm MgCl2. Annealing buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl. Oligonucleotides—Oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from a commercial supplier and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% acrylamide, 7 m urea) followed by elution from the gel using the Schleicher & Schuell Biotrap unit. The sequence of the 24/36-mer DNA/DNA p/t 2The abbreviations used are: p/tprimer-templateSp-α-S-dTTP2′-deoxythymidine-5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate); Spisomerα-S-dTTP2′-deoxythymidine-5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate). was 5′-GTGGTGCGAAATTTCTGACAGACA and 5′-GTGCGTCTGTCXTGTCTGTCAGAAATTCTGCACCAC (where X represents A for correct insertion, and X is G for misinsertion), respectively. The sequence of the fluorescently labeled 18/36-mer DNA/DNA p/t was 5′-TCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCT*C and 5′-TGTGGAAAATCTCATGCAGAGGCGCCCGAACAGGGA and the sequence of the fluorescently labeled 24/36-mer DNA/DNA p/t was 5′-GTGGTGCGAAATTTCTGACAGAT*A and 5′-GTGCGTCTGTCATATCTGTCAGAAATTCTGCACCAC (where T* represents 5-C6-amino-2′-deoxythymidine linked to mansyl). Coupling of a mansyl fluorophor to an amino linker at positions 17 and 23 of the 18- and 24-mer primer, respectively (see above), was performed as described previously (18Krebs R. Immendorfer U. Thrall S.H. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10292-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Primer oligodeoxynucleotides for the nucleotide incorporation studies were 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase as described (19Thrall S.H. Krebs R. Wöhrl B.W. Cellai L. Goody R.S. Restle T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13349-13358Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Primer and template oligodeoxynucleotides were annealed by heating equimolar amounts in annealing buffer at 90 °C, followed by cooling to room temperature over several hours in a metal block. The completeness of the reaction was checked by determining whether 100% of the primer could be extended by one nucleotide. The samples were analyzed on 10% denaturing gels. primer-template 2′-deoxythymidine-5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate); Spisomer 2′-deoxythymidine-5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate). Nucleotides— dNTPs were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and Sp-α-S-dTTP was obtained from BioLog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany). Fluorescence Titrations of Primer-Template Binding—Fluorescence titrations were performed using an SLM Smart 8100 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a PH-PC 9635 photomultiplier. Fluorescence of the mansyl group was excited at 365 nm, and the emission was monitored at 420 nm. The rhodamine chromophor was excited at 541 nm, and the emission was observed at 578 nm. Data were evaluated using the program Grafit (Erithacus Software). The relative fluorescence was plotted against the corresponding protein concentration, and the dissociation constant was calculated using a quadratic equation. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. To determine the affinity constant via competition experiments, a preformed complex of labeled p*/t (68 nm) and Dbh (86 nm) was titrated with unlabeled p/t (where the asterisk indicates the covalently linked chromophor mansyl). Rapid Kinetics of p/t·Dbh Association—Concentration-dependent p/t Dbh association was analyzed using a homemade pressure jump apparatus as described elsewhere (20Jacob M.H. Saudan C. Holtermann G. Martin A. Perl D. Merbach A.E. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A preformed p*/t·Dbh complex (80 nm p*/t and varying concentrations of Dbh; 0.4-1 μm) was exposed to 1000 pressure jumps (2-40 MPa). The kinetic time courses were observed via a cut-off filter (418 nm) after excitation of the mansyl fluorophor at 365 nm. The reassociation kinetic (pressure down) was analyzed, fitting the averaged experimental data to a single exponential equation. Rapid Kinetics of p/t·Dbh Dissociation—Stopped-flow experiments were carried out with a Hi-Tech SF-61 MX multimixing stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter at 25 °C. The mansyl chromophor of the labeled p/t (see above) was excited at 365 nm. Emission at 420 nm was detected via a 418-nm cut-off filter. Competition of the fluorescent labeled p/t was initiated by rapidly mixing equal volumes of preformed p*/t·Dbh complex (80 nm p/t and 60 nm Dbh) with an excess of unlabeled p/t (900 nm). All concentrations reported are final concentrations after mixing in the stopped-flow cell. Data were evaluated using the program Grafit. Rapid Kinetics of Nucleotide Incorporation—Rapid quench experiments were carried out in a chemical quench flow apparatus (RQF-3, KinTek Corp., University Park, PA). Reactions were started by rapidly mixing the two reactants (15 μl each) and then quenched with 0.6% trifluoroacetic acid at defined time intervals. All concentrations reported are final concentrations after mixing in the rapid quench apparatus. Products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea) and quantitated by scanning the dried gel using a phosphor imager (Fuji FLA 5000). Data were evaluated using the program Grafit (Erithacus Software). For pre-steady-state kinetics, a preformed complex of p/t·Dbh (100 nm p/t and 1.5 μm Dbh) was rapidly mixed with an excess of dNTP (100 μm to 6 mm) and stopped after various times in the millisecond to second range. Data were fitted to a single exponential burst equation. The effective pre-steady-state constants (kpol) at the given dNTP concentration are derived from the exponential rate. Affinity of dTTP with the binary Dbh·p/t complex was determined by the dependence of the pre-steady-state burst rate on the dTTP concentration. To measure the affinity of the dTTP, the preformed p/t·Dbh (100 nm and 1.5 μm) complex was rapidly mixed with various concentrations of dTTP and quenched after t½ of the maximal pre-steady-state rate. The corresponding rates were then calculated from the concentration of elongated primer by converting the exponential equation into k =-ln[1 - ([P+1]t/[P]0)]/t(s). [P]0 corresponds to the concentration of Dbh·p/t complex available for incorporation at t = 0 (burst amplitude), and t equals the reaction time (t½ of the maximal pre-steady-state rate). The observed rates were plotted against the dTTP concentration, and the dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated by fitting the data to a hyperbola. Misincorporation Kinetics—Misincorporation experiments were performed manually. Reactions were started by mixing equal volumes (5 μl) of the two reactants and then quenched with 0.6% trifluoroacetic acid after defined time intervals. Products were analyzed as described above. The dissociation constant was determined as described under “Rapid Kinetics of Nucleotide Incorporation,” using dTTP concentrations in the range of 1 μm to 6 mm. Interaction of Dbh with Primer-Template under Steady-state Conditions—To investigate the binding affinity of Dbh to DNA, equilibrium titrations with a 24/36 DNA/DNA p/t were performed, using a mansyl chromophor attached to the primer as probe (p*). Fig. 1A shows a typical titration curve of the mansyl-labeled p/t molecule with Dbh. Titration of a fixed p*/t concentration (80 nm) with increasing amounts of Dbh resulted in an increase of fluorescence of about 70%. By fitting the experimental data to a quadratic equation, an equilibrium constant (Kd) of 61.6 ± 2.0 nm for this interaction could be obtained. Using a 18/36 DNA/DNA p/t comprising an entirely different sequence (see under “Experimental Procedures”) a Kd of 55.4 ± 6.0 nm was obtained (data not shown). Interestingly, the affinity of Dbh to DNA is surprisingly low compared with other DNA polymerases with typical Kd values in the low nanomolar range. To exclude the possibility that the observed signal increase was caused by nonspecific interactions between the fluorescence label and the Dbh, we performed fluorescence titrations of tetramethylrhodamine-labeled Dbh with unlabeled p/t. Fig. 1B shows a titration curve of 80 nm Dbh with increasing amounts of p/t. The DNA binding resulted in a quenching of the fluorescence signal of ∼25%. The curve shows the best fit of the experimental data to a quadratic equation, yielding a binding affinity (Kd) of 58.9 ± 12.9 nm. The excellent agreement of the two Kd values observed, applying two different strategies, suggests that there is no nonspecific interaction between the polymerase and the fluorescence label. A further method to confirm the observed Kd of the labeled DNA to Dbh is to determine the binding affinity of an unlabeled p/t indirectly via competition experiments (19Thrall S.H. Krebs R. Wöhrl B.W. Cellai L. Goody R.S. Restle T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13349-13358Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, a preformed complex of p*/t·Dbh (68 nm p*t and 86 nm Dbh) was titrated with unlabeled p/t (Fig. 2). Data were fitted to a multiequilibrium model, yielding a binding affinity of 52.7 ± 7.1 nm. This indirectly derived dissociation constant again corresponds very well with the data obtained from the direct titrations. Time-resolved Characterization of p/t Binding—To characterize the DNA binding reaction in more detail, stopped-flow experiments were performed. First, we examined whether the p/t Dbh association occurs in a concentration-dependent manner. To address this question, equal volumes of p*/t (80 nm) and Dbh (400-1000 nm) solutions were rapidly mixed, and the time course of the fluorescence change was monitored. Surprisingly, the binding kinetics was so fast that merely the last 20% of the reaction could be resolved. Accordingly, a proper evaluation of the experimental data was not possible by applying this technique. Thus, a pressure jump apparatus was used to resolve the fast association kinetic of p/t and Dbh. The time resolution of such a device is about 10-20 times higher as compared with a stopped-flow apparatus. Preincubated complexes of p*/t·Dbh (80 nm p*/t and 400-1000 nm Dbh) were applied to 1000 pressure jumps. A representative time course of the relaxation kinetics of a p/t·Dbh complex after pressure jumps down (900 nm Dbh and 80 nm p*/t) is shown in Fig. 3A. The association kinetics suggests a one-step p/t binding mechanism. The best fit to a single exponential equation resulted in a pseudo-first-order rate constant (kobs) of 1210 ± 35 s-1. The secondary plot of the dependence of kobs on the Dbh concentration shows that the observed rates are concentration-dependent. The data were fitted to a linear regression, yielding a slope of 1.35 ± 0.12 nm-1 s-1, which corresponds to the association rate (kon). This association rate suggests that p/t binding of Dbh is a very fast process and occurs in a diffusion-controlled manner. Next, the dissociation kinetic of a labeled p*/t·Dbh complex was examined. The dissociation rate was determined using the stopped-flow technique. A preformed complex (80 nm labeled p*/t and 60 nm Dbh) was rapidly mixed with a high excess of unlabeled p/t. The resulting time course of the fluorescence signal change is shown in Fig. 4. The best fit of the experimental data to a single exponential equation yielded a dissociation rate (koff) of 62.7 ± 0.12 s-1. By dividing the observed dissociation rate by the association rate, an overall affinity of 46.4 nm can be calculated. This calculated Kd is in excellent agreement with the equilibrium measurements (see above). Time Course of Single-turnover, Single Nucleotide Incorporation—To analyze mechanistic details of the nucleotide incorporation reaction, we performed single-turnover, single nucleotide incorporation studies of dTTP into a 24/36 DNA/DNA p/t substrate. These experiments were carried out under saturating concentrations of nucleotide to exclude the possibility that the observed single-turnover rates were influenced by substrate binding events. Incorporation of dTTP with an excess of enzyme over p/t occurred in a monophasic burst of product formation (Fig. 5A). Fitting of the experimental data to a single exponential equation yielded an incorporation rate (kpol) of 0.64 ± 0.03 s-1. This maximum rate constant of correct nucleotide incorporation is markedly lower than the rates reported for conventional DNA polymerases. For the correct incorporation of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP into a 24/36 DNA/DNA p/t substrate, a kpol of 2.5 ± 0.1, 3.7 ± 0.6, and 5.6 ± 0.6 s-1, respectively was obtained (data not shown). Surprisingly, performing an equivalent incorporation experiment as described above under multiple-turnover conditions (excess of p/t over enzyme; 1.5 μm and 100 nm, respectively), we observe a burst of product formation followed by a slower steady-state phase with a rate of about 0.2 s-1 (data not shown). This finding is somewhat unexpected, since the results of the DNA binding study and the single-turnover analysis (kpol << koff) would suggest that a burst is not observed. A likely explanation for this finding is a considerably reduced off-rate in the presence of high concentrations of nucleotide representing the rate-limiting step of multiple-turnover nucleotide incorporation. To confirm that the observed slow phase indeed represents the steady-state phase, we performed an equivalent incorporation experiment with the exception that the preformed enzyme-substrate complex was rapidly mixed with nucleotide in the presence of a competitor substrate (5 μm unlabeled 24/36 DNA/DNA p/t). The addition of this trap leads to a complete disappearance of the slow phase (data not shown). dTTP Binding Affinity for Correct Nucleotide Insertion—To ensure that the observed single-turnover rate of incorporation was not limited by binding parameters, we carefully examined the binding affinities of the incoming dTTP. The affinity was calculated by plotting the observed rates at various concentrations of dTTP and fitting the data to a hyperbola. The curve in Fig. 5B shows the best fit to a hyperbolic equation, resulting in a dissociation constant (Kd) of 591 ± 55 μm. Single-turnover Nucleotide Misincorporation of dTTP Opposite Template G—Next, we examined the misincorporation rate of dTTP opposite a template G to gain insight into the mechanistic details of nucleotide misincorporation of Dbh. Because of the slow misincorporation rate, it was not necessary to use a chemical quench flow apparatus. The amount of 25-mer product was plotted as a function of time and fitted to a single exponential equation. Fig. 6A shows the best fit to a single exponential equation, yielding a misincorporation rate of 0.0017 ± 0.0001 s-1. dTTP Binding Affinity for Incorrect Nucleotide Insertion—As already outlined above, it is essential to ensure that the incorporation studies are carried out at saturating nucleotide concentrations. We therefore also examined the binding affinities of the incoming nucleotide for the incorrect insertion opposite template G. The rate dependence on the concentration of dTTP was determined by plotting the calculated rates at various concentrations of dTTP and fitting the data to a hyperbola (Fig. 6B). The best fit yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1299 ± 100 μm. Elemental Effect for Correct and Incorrect Nucleotide Insertion—The next step was to investigate the underlying mechanism of the observed incorporation rates. The rates may reflect a rate-limiting conformational change prior to the chemical step, as it had been observed for other polymerases (e.g. HIV-1 RT, Klenow fragment, T7 DNA polymerase) (21Hsieh J.C. Zinnen S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24607-24613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dahlberg M.E. Benkovic S.J.

On the other hand, the rates could be due to a rate-limiting chemical step. To distinguish between these two possible scenarios, we examined the effect of a sulfur atom substitution for oxygen at the α-phosphate of dTTP on the incorporation rate of correct and incorrect insertion. Analogous to the experiments described above, we determined the correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation kinetics of α-S-dTTP into a 24/36 DNA/DNA p/t substrate under single-turnover conditions. Besides, we measured the binding affinity for α-S-dTTP in order to ensure that the incorporation studies are carried out at saturating nucleotide concentrations. The rate dependence on the concentration of α-S-dTTP was determined by plotting the calculated rates at various concentrations of α-S-dTTP and fitting the data to a hyperbola (Fig. 5B). The best fit yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) of 334.4 ± 16.2 μm. Fig. 5A shows the time courses of the product formation for the correct incorporation of dTTP and α-S-dTTP by Dbh. The best fit of the experimental data to a single exponential equation yielded an incorporation rate of 0.07 ± 0.003 s-1 for α-S-dTTP. Compared with the incorporation rate of dTTP, the single nucleotide incorporation rate of α-S-dTTP was about 9-fold slower. Thus, the correct nucleotide incorporation shows an elemental effect, suggesting that the chemical step is rate-limiting. For the incorrect α-S-dTTP incorporation, the elemental effect was so high that we could not observe any product formation over a long period of time (>3 h). Since product formation during incorrect insertion of α-S-dTTP was below the detection limit, we were not able to determine a true value for this large elemental effect. To verify that α-S-dTTP does bind to the polymerase under these conditions, we checked if the modified nucleotide inhibits dTTP insertion opposite G. At a concentration of 2 mm dTTP in the presence of 2 mm α-S-dTTP, we observed a reduction of product formation by about 50% (data not shown). In this study, we have examined fundamental parameters of the DNA binding and nucleotide incorporation characteristics of the archaeal Y-family DinB homologue (Dbh) DNA polymerase of S. solfataricus. Performing equilibrium fluorescence titrations and competition experiments, we determined a DNA binding affinity of a 18/36 and 24/36 p/t to Dbh in the range of 50-60 nm. This Kd value is surprisingly low compared with 2 nm in case of human immunodefic"

Using a combination of approaches, we have mapped a single residue on the surface of the ETS domain critical for protein tethering by the C/EBPβ carboxylterminal bZIP domain. This residue is also important for nuclear localization and DNA binding.

Hashimoto Y. Oikawa T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). The carboxyl end of the TAD contains a phosphorylatable PEST sequence that aids in the formation of a protein-protein interaction with transcription factors IRF-4 and -8 (10Escalante C.R. Brass A.L.

Besides DNA binding, this domain is also a tethering site for multiple transactivators, some of which occur at composite DNA-binding sites (reviewed in Ref. 12Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6514-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and contains the previously coarsely mapped nuclear localization signal (NLS) (13Boulukos K.E. Pognonec P. Rabault B. Begue A. Ghysdael J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5718-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The structure of the Spi-1 DBD, like other ETS factors, consists of 85 conserved residues folded into a winged-helix-turn-helix (wHTH) conformation (14Kodandapani R. Pio F. Ni C.Z. Piccialli G.

DNA-binding domain gene encoding the interleukin-1β protein basic leucine zipper domain transactivation domain upstream induction sequence for the interleukin-1β gene. Spi-1 plays a necessary role in the regulation of the IL1B promoter by cooperating functionally with C/EBPβ, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family member (16Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This cooperativity may be derived, in part, by a physical interaction between the DBD of both molecules and the two composite DNA-binding sites in the IL1B promoter (Fig. 2a) (18Yang Z. Wara-Aswapati N. Chen C. Tsukada J. Auron P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21272-21277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The downstream TATA-proximal site binds relatively well to Spi-1 but weakly to C/EBPβ (7Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar). C/EBPβ DNA binding at this site appears to be supported by a protein interaction with the adjacent DNA-binding domain of Spi-1 (18Yang Z. Wara-Aswapati N. Chen C. Tsukada J. Auron P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21272-21277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Relative binding of these two factors at the upstream site is reversed relative to the downstream site and may play an especially critical role in serving to tether Spi-1 to C/EBPβ bound at a site (located between -2768 and -2761) in the IL1B upstream induction sequence (UIS) enhancer (19Tsukada J. Saito K. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7285-7297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), based upon a greater loss of general enhancer function when the upstream site is deleted from the promoter (7Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar). Analogous phenomena have been described between ETS and other transcription factors (reviewed in (20Verger A. Duterque-Coquillaud M. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 362-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)). For example, the cooperative function observed for Spi-1 and IRF-4 on the IgL λ enhancer is explained, in part, by the enhanced DNA binding of IRF4 mediated by sidechain contacts with Arg222 and Lys223 on the adjacent bound Spi-1 (10Escalante C.R. Brass A.L. Pongubala J.M. Shatova E. Shen L. Singh H. Aggarwal A.K. Mol Cell. 2002; 10: 1097-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). C-Myb, another HTH protein, was shown to interact with the bZIP domain of C/EBPβ while each was bound to a remote DNA site, demonstrating a model of tethering between an enhancer and promoter (21Tahirov T.H.

In contrast, Spi-1 interactions with several proteins including C/EBPβ and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE2 reveal clear cooperative function but no obvious DNA binding cooperativity (18Yang Z.

Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to a hypothesis of protein-tethered transactivation, whereby a direct DNA-binding protein tethers another protein, resulting in either activation or inhibition of function (18Yang Z. Wara-Aswapati N. Chen C. Tsukada J. Auron P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21272-21277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R.

Therefore, understanding the molecular basis for these kinds of interactions continues to be intensely studied. While investigating the nature of the Spi-1-C/EBPβ interaction, we uncovered new functions for the highly conserved arginines of helix 3 (Arg232 and Arg235) within the DNA recognition site. These functions expand upon the classic role these residues play in DNA binding and suggest new mechanisms of functional cooperativity and protein-DNA interaction for transcription factors. Plasmids—The pGL3B HT reporter plasmid was constructed as described previously (18Yang Z. Wara-Aswapati N. Chen C. Tsukada J. Auron P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21272-21277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The 3MEHT and 3MEHTΔIL6 expression plasmids contain the IL1B promoter sequence -131 to +12, and the IL1B promoter sequence -131 to +12 with deletion of the C/EBPβ-binding site at -95 to -80, respectively, ligated to pA10CAT3ME (24Shirakawa F.

The HCMV expression vector pEQ326 (IE2), gift from Adam Geballe (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA), contains the genomic HCMV IE2 DNA inserted into pGEM1 vector. The C/EBPβ pCDNA3.1 expression vector contains the full-length cDNA for C/EBPβ (19Tsukada J. Saito K. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7285-7297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bZIP portion of C/EBPβ from amino acids 269-345 was previously cloned into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and pGEX 2T (Amersham Biosciences) by PCR (18Yang Z. Wara-Aswapati N. Chen C. Tsukada J. Auron P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21272-21277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Spi-1 pRC/CMV expression vector contains the murine Spi-1 cDNA as reported previously (25Galson D.L. Hensold J.O. Bishop T.R. Schalling M. D'Andrea A.D. Jones C. Auron P.E. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2929-2941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spi mutants were constructed using PCR mutagenesis as described previously (23Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spi-1/ETS DBD constructs were either mutated within parent wild type (WT) plasmids or cloned by PCR amplification into either pRC/CMV for use in transfection assays, or pEX 2T (Amersham Biosciences) for use in GST pull-down assays as described previously (23Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The pCMVSport-β-Gal vector was used in luciferase assays for normalization purposes. Purification of Fusion Proteins and GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins were harvested from Escherichia coli BL21(DE)pLysS (Promega, Madison, WI) using previously described methods (23Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3-4 h, pellets were suspended in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) with 1 mm dithiothreitol, PefaBloc (Roche Applied Science), and one Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) tablet/50 ml. Suspensions were sonicated on ice and supernatants collected. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed in NETN buffer and incubated with fusion proteins at 4 °C rotating overnight. Beads were washed three times with NETN buffer and incubated with the in vitro translated protein probe of interest for 45 min rotating at 4 °C. After three washes with ice-cold NETN, beads were boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with SimplyBlue Safestain (Invitrogen) for protein determination and analyzed for binding using autoradiography. Radioloabeled protein probes were synthesized in vitro (TNT T7 quick coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) and labeled with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—For luciferase assays, HeLa S3 cells were transfected by Effectene reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, 4 × 104 HeLa S3 cells were plated in 24 well plates 24 h before transfection. Immediately before transfections, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and placed in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Plasmid DNA (1.5 μg) was mixed in 60 μl of Qiagen EC buffer, 8.5 μl of enhancer, and 12.5 μl of Effectene reagent. After 5-10-min incubation at room temperature, DMEM was added to the transfection mixture, and an equal volume was transferred to each of three wells for triplicate samples. After 24 h, cells were washed with DMEM. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection with luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and extracts were analyzed by luminometry (Luminoskan, Thermo Labsystems, Ramsey, MN). Results represent an average luciferase value after normalization to β-galactosidase activity as measured at the time of harvest with β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). For all transfections the total DNA amounts were kept constant using empty parental vectors. The CaPO4 transfection and CAT assays were carried out as described previously (23Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot—Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were extracted from cells using a kit from Pierce Biotechnology following manufacturer's instructions. After extraction, samples were separated on 16% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene diflouride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blotted with anti-Spi-1 antibody PU.1 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Reactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded oligonucleotide homologous to IL1B promoter region -131 to -58 was synthesized and labeled using DNA polymerase Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dGTP. Proteins were synthesized in vitro (TNT T7 coupled wheat germ extract system, Promega) and labeled with [35S]methionine. Relative protein amounts were estimated based on densitometry of autoradiographs of in vitro translation reactions, and volumes were adjusted to ensure equal amounts (and volumes) were added to DNA-protein binding reactions. Protein and labeled DNA probes were incubated under binding conditions of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm MgCl2, 0.06 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol with 1 μg poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 15 μl. The binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel using 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Conserved Arginines of Spi-1 DBD Confer Binding to C/EBPβ and IE2—Dose-response experiments revealed vigorous transactivation of the IL1B promoter by Spi-1 and C/EBPβ (Fig. 2, b and c, respectively). IE2, a viral transactivator derived from HCMV, could improve this activity by 4-10-fold in the absence of the UIS upstream enhancer (Fig. 2d). A collection of alanine substitutions of the Spi-1 DBD were generated for use as probes with GST fusions of the C/EBPβ bZIP domain and IE2. Substitution at Arg232 resulted in 80 and 50% reductions in C/EBPβ bZIP and IE2 binding, respectively, while substitution at Arg235 had a smaller effect on binding to C/EBPβ bZIP and little or no effect on binding with IE2 (Fig. 3). Combining the substitutions resulted in a 90% reduction in C/EBPβ bZIP binding. Substitutions in homologous residues previously shown to interfere with interaction between Jun/Fos, a bZIP heterodimer, and Erg, an ETS factor with homology to Spi-1, were also made (26Verger A. Buisine E. Carrere S. Wintjens R. Flourens A. Coll J. Stehelin D. Duterque-Coquillaud M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17181-17189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These substitutions, at Asn236, Tyr237, and Lys239 in Spi-1 had no effect on bZIP binding (data not shown). Substitutions at Arg222, Lys223, and Lys224 (containing residues that mediate Spi-1 DBD interaction with IFR4 (10Escalante C.R. Brass A.L. Pongubala J.M. Shatova E. Shen L. Singh H. Aggarwal A.K. Mol Cell. 2002; 10: 1097-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)) also did not abrogate interaction with bZIP or IE2 (data not shown). Nuclear Localization of Spi-1 DBD Also Depends on Conserved Arginines—Western blotting was performed on cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts to evaluate the expression of various mutated Spi-1 or DBD expression vectors and the results quantified by densitometry and compared with the ability of the same proteins to bind DNA by EMSA. There was a dramatic reduction in Spi-1 localized to the nucleus from 13% using WT to <1% using either alanine or aspartate substitutions at Arg232 (lane 1 versus lanes 6 and 7, respectively, in Fig. 4a and the indicated columns in b). As expected, we did not observe DNA binding for these proteins (Fig. 4c). However, the R235A substitution had no effect on nuclear localization, while reversing the charge with aspartate resulted in reduction to about 1% in nuclear localization (Fig. 4a, lanes 1 versus lanes 8 and 9, respectively, and the indicated columns in b). Although no detectable binding was observed for the charge-reversal substitution R235D, there was detectable, albeit reduced, DNA binding for the R235A substitution (Fig. 4c). Combined alanine substitutions at Arg232 and Arg235 resulted in further reduction to <0.1% of the total protein in the nucleus and no detectable DNA binding (lane 1 versus lane 10, respectively, in Fig. 4a and the indicated lanes in b and c). When compared with the control, R222A, K223E, and K224E all had equivalent or slightly greater nuclear localization, but there was reduced DNA binding observed for R222A and K223E and normal DNA binding detected for K224E (Fig. 4a, lane 1 versus lanes 3-5, respectively, and the indicated lanes in b and c). Thus, not every substitution that impaired DNA binding resulted in reduced nuclear localization. The I191E-substituted protein was not detectable in the nuclear compartment and barely observable in the cytoplasm following transient tranfection (Fig. 4a, lane 2). When expressed in vitro, I191E did not detectably bind DNA (Fig. 4c). These results are consistent with a loss of function for this mutant (Fig. 4d) resulting from compromised integrity to the structural hydrophobic core of the protein. The observation that only a fraction of total Spi-1 localized to the nucleus corresponded with fluorescent microscopic observations made using green fluorescent protein fusion proteins, revealing both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization for the full-length molecule but predominantly nuclear localization for the isolated DBD (data not shown). These observations suggest that some upstream portion of the Spi-1 molecule interferes with or regulates Spi-1 nuclear localization. To better quantify these observations, we also tested the intracellular distribution of the Spi-1 DBD by subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4a, lane 1 versus lane 11). The results showed a dramatic increase in localization to the nuclear compartment for the DBD to ∼⅔ of the total protein (Fig. 4b). Functional Analysis of Spi-1 DBD Residues—Expression vectors for selected Spi-1 constructs described in Fig. 4a were used in an IL1B promoter reporter assay to correlate protein expression with function (Fig. 4d). Protein expression from cell lysates was measured, and the nuclear localization of each protein could be accounted for in the context of the Western blot results in Fig. 4b. For example, when R224A was expressed at low levels, it was more active than wild type Spi-1 expressed at a similar level. This was internally consistent with the observation that this protein possesses normal DNA binding and increased nuclear localization. At higher levels of expression the difference became minimal. On the other hand, substitution at Arg232 or both Arg232 and Arg235 resulted in negligible reporter activity at lower expression levels and minimal activity at higher expression levels. Surprisingly, the R235A substitution yielded intermediate function at low expression levels and normal function when expression was high. This correlated well with the normal nuclear localization and reduced, but still detectable, DNA binding capacity. Other substitutions at Arg222 and Lys223 have been tested by titration using reporter analysis, but without measurement of protein expression, and function similarly to the wild type Spi-1 (data not shown). Residues 330-345 at the COOH-terminal End of C/EBPβ Mediate Binding to the Spi-1 ETS Domain and Support Spi-1 Function on the IL1B Promoter—The C/EBPβ molecule contains a transactivation domain at its N terminus and a basic leucine zipper structure at its COOH terminus (Fig. 5a). C/EBPβ, like other bZIP proteins dimerizes via the leucine zipper, which positions the basic region of each monomer at two opposing locations along the DNA major groove, thus recognizing a palindromic DNA motif. The coil-coil structure of the zipper protrudes away from the DNA helix at right angles, pointing into the solvent (21Tahirov T.H. Sato K. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Sasaki M. Inoue-Bungo T. Shiina M.

The bZIP region of C/EBPβ can also interact with numerous transcription factors, including other ETS family members and c-Myb (18Yang Z. Wara-Aswapati N. Chen C. Tsukada J. Auron P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21272-21277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell.

Auron P.E. Eto S. Blood. 1997; 90: 3142-3153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise region of the bZIP molecule making these contacts was uncertain until the recent demonstration that 11 residues of the COOH-terminal end of the C/EBPβ bZIP molecule are required for interaction with c-Myb while bound to a remote DNA site (21Tahirov T.H. Sato K. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Sasaki M. Inoue-Bungo T. Shiina M. Kimura K. Takata S. Fujikawa A. Morii H. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Ishii S. Ogata K. Cell. 2002; 108: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a similar kind of complex interaction could occur between C/EBPβ and Spi-1. To test this hypothesis, we generated a bZIP fragment lacking residues 330-345 at the COOH-terminal end (bZIP Δ330-345). Using GST fusion protein pull-down analysis, we found that bZIP Δ330-345 had essentially complete loss of binding to a GST-ETS fusion protein compared with wild type bZIP, thus recapitulating the interaction between the C/EBP bZIP and c-Myb (Fig. 5b). We previously reported that a minimal promoter containing only the TATA proximal composite site (DT in Fig. 2a) retained C/EBPβ-dependent cooperativity even when the C/EBP-binding site was rendered non-functional by substitutions that prevent C/EBPβ binding (18Yang Z. Wara-Aswapati N. Chen C. Tsukada J. Auron P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21272-21277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Using a similar approach, we investigated the role of tethering at the upstream composite site. Because of the observed multiple functions of Arg232 in the Spi-1 DBD, we needed an alternative method to investigate the functional role of tethering. First, we found that the activity of the reporter containing an upstream C/EBPβ site deletion can be completely restored by increasing the amount of co-transfected Spi-1 expression vector (Fig. 5c). This result led to a hypothesis that the COOH terminus of the bZIP domain could support Spi-1 function. This was tested by determining the responsiveness of the IL1B reporter to transfection with either bZIP or bZIP Δ330-345 when co-transfected with Spi-1 and C/EBPβ (Fig. 5d). The results showed that cooperative transactivation of the IL1B promoter was enhanced by the TAD-deficient bZIP domain but not when missing the last 15 COOH-terminal residues. The loss of function by bZIP Δ330-345 could not be explained by the loss of DNA binding by this truncated product (Fig. 5e). In our quest to map protein-tethering sites on the Spi-1 DBD, we have uncovered what may be novel functions for conserved arginines found in the DBD of all ETS members. Although these residues are well recognized for their role in DNA binding, our data support other functions relating to nuclear localization and protein tethering. The NLS for ETS factors was previously localized to the DBD (13Boulukos K.E. Pognonec P. Rabault B. Begue A. Ghysdael J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5718-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, consensus searching did not reveal a classical NLS signal for this family of proteins. Our results reveal that nuclear localization is mediated by a non-classical NLS seated primarily over helix 3, which has Arg232 and Arg235 protruding into the solvent. The fact that deletion of the Spi-1 TAD leads to a significantly greater proportion of protein in the nucleus suggests that a region of the NH2 terminus physically blocks access to helix 3. This may serve to either interfere with or regulate nuclear localization. While many DNA-binding proteins have NLS activity localized to their DBD (33LaCasse E.C. Lefebvre Y.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we are aware of only a few that have had NLS function and DNA binding co-localized to the same residues. These include the bZIP family members CREB, C/EBP, and Jun (34Forwood J.K. Lam M.H.C. Jans D.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5208-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Waeber G. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Williams S.C. Angerer N.D. Johnson P.F. Gene Expr. 1997; 6: 371-385PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting finding was that alanine substitution at Arg232 and Arg235 dramatically reduced binding to C/EBPβ with a lesser effect on binding to IE2. At first glance, this did not conform to our notions regarding the location of the interaction between these tethered partners, which was to assume interaction at a surface other than that contacting DNA. We previously reported that Spi-1 could tether C/EBPβ to the promoter because the downstream TATA proximal composite site binds strongly to Spi-1 but not C/EBPβ and that activity required the presence of the C/EBPβ TAD (18Yang Z. Wara-Aswapati N. Chen C. Tsukada J. Auron P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21272-21277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Using a similar approach here, we investigated the role of tethering at the upstream composite site. This idea was plausible because we had previously reported that the downstream high avidity Spi-1 site and the low avidity upstream site were each required for maximal activity. However, deletion of the upstream C/EBPβ site demonstrated that it was important but less crucial (7Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar). We now show that the activity of the reporter containing the upstream C/EBPβ site deletion could be completely restored by increasing the amount of co-transfected Spi-1 expression vector. These data suggest that the function of this site does not require the specificity of the C/EBPβ TAD but rather a non-TAD-dependent cooperativity such as a protein-protein interaction. The observed cooperative effect of a TAD-deficient C/EBPβ bZIP on Spi-1 and C/EBPβ-dependent transactivation of the IL1B promoter upstream composite site is compelling evidence to support the hypothesis that the bZIP domain facilitates Spi-1 binding to this low avidity site. This result is in contrast to the expected dominant negative function typically found for C/EBP fragments missing the TAD in other systems. Loss of bZIP cooperativity by deletion of 15 COOH-terminal residues points to a region that mediates the tethering function with Spi-1 DBD. The loss of cooperative function by the deletion construct cannot be due to loss of dimerization or DNA binding as we observed equal, if not better, DNA binding by bZIP Δ330-345. C/EBPβ and IE2 interact at a similar site on Spi-1, but with some distinctions that remain undefined given the difference in the degree of lost binding to C/EBPβ and IE2 when Arg232 and Arg235 are substituted. More biochemical and/or direct structural studies will be needed to precisely define the topography. Our results raise interesting questions regarding the role of protein tethering at a locus critical for DNA binding. Analysis of the Spi-1 DBD crystal structure (14Kodandapani R. Pio F. Ni C.Z. Piccialli G. Klemsz M. McKercher S. Maki R.A. Ely K.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) shows that helix 3 sits in the major groove with Arg232 residing at the outside edge of the helix exposed to solvent (Fig. 6a). However, it does not seem likely that this residue would be accessible for interaction with the COOH terminus of C/EBPβ bound to an immediately adjacent DNA binding site. However, C/EBPβ in solution or complexed with a remote DNA site could gain access to this site. This model is somewhat similar to that shown for tethering of a remote C/EBPβ enhancer site to c-Myb on the mim-1 promoter, although the molecular interactions differ (21Tahirov T.H. Sato K. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Sasaki M. Inoue-Bungo T. Shiina M. Kimura K. Takata S. Fujikawa A. Morii H. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Ishii S. Ogata K. Cell. 2002; 108: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The C/EBPβ leucine zipper primarily interacts with a surface of c-Myb that does not directly contact DNA, while tangentially interacting with the DNA backbone outside of the major groove (21Tahirov T.H. Sato K. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Sasaki M. Inoue-Bungo T. Shiina M. Kimura K. Takata S. Fujikawa A. Morii H. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Ishii S. Ogata K. Cell. 2002; 108: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In contrast, the location of Spi-1 Arg232 within the major groove suggests a novel penetration of the groove by the COOH terminus of the leucine zipper (Fig. 6a). This is plausible given the extensive basic electrostatic field surrounding the C/EBPβ leucine zipper as compared with that of Jun/Fos (Fig. 6, b-e). This field would further potentiate a mass-action model given the acidic nature of DNA at sites of transcription, because electrostatic fields are stronger over greater distances than hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces (37Schulz G.E. Schirmer R.H. Principals of Protein Structure. 1984; (pp., Springer-Verlag, New York): 27-36Google Scholar). These forces could serve to dock the bZIP leucine zipper within the major groove and position the COOH terminus for interaction with at least one of the two Nη amino groups of Spi-1 Arg232 located at the COOH terminus of helix α3, thus stabilizing the interaction (Fig. 6a). Alternatively, Arg232 and helix α3 could interact with tethering partners of DNA. This raises the possibility of two discrete functions that would depend on specific kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the protein and DNA interactions. First, the protein interaction may serve to compartmentalize Spi-1 with partner proteins at composite DNA-binding sites (Fig. 7). Such interactions would display cooperative binding on the promoter. This model would be particularly valuable for composite promoter sites where the KD for C/EBPβ binding to DNA is low and Spi-1 is high, as is the case for the upstream IL1B composite site (Fig. 7a). The converse is true for the downstream TATA-proximal composite site (Fig. 7b). Therefore, C/EBPβ and Spi-1 might either pre-associate prior to targeting the IL1B DNA via a C/EBPβ-Spi-1 interaction or C/EBPβ could first bind its cognate site and serve as a protein-protein-mediated recruiter for Spi-1. In either case, the interaction of one factor with its cognate DNA target would increase the local concentration of the other factor in the vicinity of its weak DNA-binding site, thus driving the interaction via mass-action following protein-protein dissociation. This thermo-kinetic scenario could occur for other promoters containing composite Spi-1 sites that exhibit DNA binding cooperativity with partner transcription factors, including the Spi-1-IRF interaction where Spi-1 possesses a greater affinity for its site than does IRF (38Brass A.L. Zhu A.Q. Singh H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Another scenario, which is not exclusive, incorporates a tether between the protein-interacting COOH terminus of C/EBPβ bound at the upstream composite site and Spi-1 bound at the proximal composite site (Fig. 7c). Similarly, tethering between C/EBPβ bound at the IL1B UIS enhancer (which contains a functional C/EBP site) and Spi-1 bound at a downstream composite site could be the structural basis for enhancer-promoter functional cooperativity. In conclusion, we have found evidence that the conserved ETS domain arginines have evolved multiple functions in addition to DNA binding. These include nuclear localization and protein binding with other transactivators. The ability of this region to serve both functions expands upon the evolving and complex story regarding interfaces on ETS proteins. We hypothesize that the thermo-kinetic mass-action model best explains the cooperativity observed between partner molecules on the IL1B promoter. We also speculate that the leucine zipper of C/EBPβ may function not only in classic bZIP homotypic dimerization but also as a cationic DNA interaction module providing an anchor for mediating long range DNA looping.

https://openalex.org/W2069455276,"Neurotrophin signaling plays important roles in regulating the survival, differentiation, and maintenance of neurons in the nervous system. Binding of neurotrophins to their cognate receptors Trks induces transactivation and phosphorylation of the receptor at several tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues then serve as crucial docking sites for adaptor proteins containing a Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domain, which upon association with the receptor initiates multiple signaling events to mediate the action of neurotrophins. Here we report the identification of a Src homology 2 domain-containing molecule, SLAM-associated protein (SAP), as an interacting protein of TrkB in a yeast two-hybrid screen. SAP was initially identified as an adaptor molecule in SLAM family receptor signaling for regulating interferon-γ secretion. In the current study, we found that SAP interacted with TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC receptors in vitro and in vivo. Binding of SAP required Trk receptor activation and phosphorylation at the tyrosine 674 residue, which is located in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Overexpression of SAP with Trk attenuated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors and reduced the binding of SH2B and Shc to TrkB. Moreover, overexpression of SAP in PC12 cells suppressed the nerve growth factor-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and phospholipase Cγ, in addition to inhibiting neurite outgrowth.

Neurotrophins are a family of trophic factors that have been demonstrated to serve important roles in multiple aspects of neuronal functions. Not only are neurotrophins required for neuronal survival and development; they are also indispensable for the regulation of synaptic transmission via modulation of neuronal architecture and synapse formation (1Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar, 2Segal R.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 299-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To date, five members of the neurotrophin family have been identified.

Members of Trks, TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, share high sequence homology and functional similarity but are activated by distinct neurotrophins. TrkA binds to NGF, NT-3, and NT-6/7, whereas TrkB activation requires association with brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT-3, or NT-4/5. TrkC, on the other hand, binds only to NT-3 (1Huang E.J.

Similar to other receptor tyrosine kinases, activation of Trk receptors involves ligand-induced receptor dimerization (4Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This leads to the subsequent trans-phosphorylation of five tyrosine residues (Tyr484, Tyr670, Tyr674, Tyr675, and Tyr785 on TrkB) on the adjacent receptor (5McCarty J.H. Feinstein S.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Among the five phosphotyrosines, Tyr484 and Tyr785 are located outside the kinase domain, whereas Tyr670, Tyr674, and Tyr675 are situated in the activation loop of the kinase domain. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues then serve as important docking sites for a myriad of adaptor molecules. For example, Shc and FRS-2 interact with TrkB via phosphorylated Tyr490, whereas SH2B and rAPS associate with the phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the activation loop. Tyr785, on the other hand, serves as docking site for PLCγ. Association of these adaptor molecules with activated Trk receptors results in the initiation of signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and PLCγ pathways, thereby mediating the actions of neurotrophins (5McCarty J.H.

Among the Trk receptors, TrkB has received increasing attention as a modulator of synaptic plasticity. TrkB was recently demonstrated to exhibit a regulatory role on dendritic spine formation (13Ji Y. Pang P.T. Feng L. Lu B. Nat.

To further elucidate the diverse functions of TrkB at synapses, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with the intracellular region of TrkB to search for potential TrkB interacting partners at the neuromuscular junction using a postnatal day 12 mouse muscle cDNA library. Interestingly, we identified SLAM-associated protein (SAP) as a novel TrkB-interacting protein. SAP is expressed abundantly in immune T cells and thymus and was originally identified as a regulatory molecule of the SLAM family receptor. SAP acts as an endogenous inhibitor of SLAM signaling by blocking the recruitment of SHP-2 to the receptor, thereby modulating interferon-γ production (21Sayos J. Wu C. Morra M. Wang N. Zhang X. Allen D. van, Schaik S. Notarangelo L. Geha R. Roncarolo M.G. Oettgen H. De Vries J.E. Aversa G. Terhorst C. Nature. 1998; 395: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Indeed, mice deficient in SAP exhibit aberrant development of certain immune cells such as NK cells and elevated production of interferon-γ (22Czar M.J. Kersh E.N. Mijares L.A. Lanier G. Lewis J.

Nonetheless, whether neuronal development or survival is altered in SAP-/- mice remains to be examined.

In the current study, we characterized the interaction between SAP and members of the Trk family. We found that SAP associates with TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, and the interaction requires tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors. Overexpression of SAP inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of all three Trk receptors and attenuates binding of Shc and SH2B to TrkB. Furthermore, examination of PC12 cells overexpressing SAP reveals that SAP suppresses the NGF-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and PLCγ and diminishes neurite extension in PC12 cells. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that SAP is a novel Trk-interacting protein, revealing its unexpected role as a negative regulator of Trk signaling and function. Plasmids and Antibodies—cDNA encoding the intracellular region of TrkB was subcloned into the yeast pAS2-1 vector, which contains the GAL4 binding domain (Clontech). The construct was used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen. Five TrkB mutants (Y484F, Y670F, Y674F, Y675F, and Y785F of TrkB) were generated by mutating the particular residue of tyrosine to phenylalanine, precluding phosphorylation at the indicated residues. The kinase-dead mutant of TrkB was obtained by mutating the lysine 540 at the ATP binding pocket to alanine using the overlapping PCR technique. The intracellular domains of the mutants were reamplified and subcloned into pAS2-1 vector. The full-length and the truncated mutant of SAP mouse cDNA (encoding amino acids 1-126, 1-103, or 104-126 of SAP) were subcloned into the yeast pACT2 vector (Clontech), which contains the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain. All yeast constructs were used for mapping the binding region of TrkB and SAP. In addition, full-length rat TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, as well as the five full-length TrkB tyrosine mutants, were amplified and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) for overexpression experiments. GST-SAP and His-tagged SAP constructs were generated by subcloning the full-length SAP sequence into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pET14b (Novagen) vectors, respectively. Protein purification was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against Trk (C-14) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal antibodies against GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4 DNA-BD) and FLAG tag were purchased from Clontech and Sigma, respectively. The antibodies against TrkB and SH2B were purchased from BD Biosciences. The polyclonal antibodies recognizing TrkA, phospho-TrkA (Tyr490), phospho-TrkA (Tyr674/675), p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, AKT, phospho-AKT (Ser473), PLCγ-1, phospho-PLCγ-1, and the monoclonal antibodies recognizing hemagglutinin tag and phosphotyrosine were purchased from Cell Signaling Inc. Rabbit SAP antibody was raised by His-tagged SAP and purified by GST-SAP using AminoLink Kit (Pierce). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed according to the Matchmaker two-hybrid screen protocol (Clontech). The pAS2-1-TrkB was used as bait to screen a mouse postnatal day 12 muscle cDNA library. Yeast strain Y190 was transformed with bait and library plasmids, and the transformants were selected on SD-Trp-Leu-His agar plates. The His+ colonies were assayed by lift filter assay. An o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside-based β-galactosidase activity assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen) antibiotics. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated horse serum (6%, v/v), heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (6%, v/v), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were normally cultured on 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes (Corning) at 37 °C in humidified incubators with 5% CO2 for 293T cells. For PC12 cells, they were cultured on collagen-coated 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes at 37 °C in humidified incubators with 7.5% CO2. Medium was changed every 3 days. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. For stable transfection, PC12 cells were cultured in the standard culture medium for 48 h after transfection. G418 selection at 400 μg/ml was applied after 20-fold dilution of the cells. G418 selection continued for 3 weeks until single colonies were formed. The isolated clones were characterized by Western blot analysis to verify protein expression. Positive clones were maintained in the culture medium with G418 at 200 μg/ml. For differentiation of PC12 cells, a density of 5 × 103 cells/35-mm plate was plated and incubated for 1 day before induction of differentiation with 50 ng/ml NGF (Alomone Laboratories). Serum concentration of the medium was changed to 1% heat-inactivated horse serum and fetal bovine serum during differentiation. Primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared from fetal mice at embryonic day 18. Cortices were dissected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, dissociated in the same medium, and plated on poly-d-lysine-coated culture plates. Cells were cultured in neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement, 0.5 mm glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cytosine arabinoside (10 mm) was added after 3 days in vitro to inhibit nonneuronal proliferation. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested and lysed with Tris lysis buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (NaoVa), and 10 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Protein lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron). The membrane was further blocked with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h. The primary antibody (1:500 or 1:1000) was incubated at 4 °C overnight followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (New England Biolabs) (1:5000) for 1 h. Protein amount on the membrane was then detected using the ECL Western blot system (Amersham Biosciences). Fusion Protein and Pull-down Assay—GST-SAP was overexpressed in BL21(DE3) bacterial strain and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the Amersham Biosciences protocol. For the binding assay, 2 μg of GST or GST-SAP was incubated with 2 mg of adult rat brain lysate homogenized with Tris lysis buffer at 4 °C overnight. Thirty μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were then mixed with the lysates at 4 °C for 1 h, washed three times with lysis buffer, and then resuspended in SDS loading buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—TrkB kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Two pmol of recombinant TrkB (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were incubated at a 1:1 molar ratio with GST, GST-SAP, His-thioredoxin, or His-SAP in the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP; 5 μg) as substrate for the kinase assay. Phosphorylated MBP proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation—For co-immunoprecipitation, the transfected 293T cell lysates, the adult rat brain and thymus tissue lysates were prepared using Tris lysis buffer. One mg of 293T lysates or 2 mg of tissue extracts were incubated with 1 μg of primary antibody at 4 °C overnight followed by mixing 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were washed two times with Tris buffer and resuspended in SDS loading buffer. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Southern Blot Analysis—For Southern blot analysis, cDNAs were reverse-transcribed from 5 μg of different rat tissue RNA using oligo(dT) random hexamer primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). After RNase H treatment, the cDNAs were amplified by PCR using primers 5′-ATGGATGCAGTGACT-3′ and 5′-CAGTATCCAGTTGAA-3′, corresponding to bp 1-15 and bp 294-309 of the SAP SH2 domain. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and then transferred to a nylon plus membrane (Osmonics Inc.). A radioactive, 32P-labeled DNA probe representing the SH2 domain of SAP was hybridized with the membrane, and the blot was exposed to the film at -80 °C for 3 h. Immunocytochemical Staining—PC12 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and blocked with 4% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were subsequently washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:500) for 1 h to stain F-actin and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:10,000) for 15 min to stain the nucleus. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted with Mowiol. The prepared slides were analyzed with an Olympus confocal microscope. Primary cortical neurons (in vitro day 7) were blocked and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 4% fetal bovine serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min followed by incubation with TrkB (1:1000) and SAP (1:5000) antibodies with or without preincubation of SAP blocking peptide at 4 °C overnight. The cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Rh-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG at room temperature for 1 h. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were mounted with Mowiol and examined under a Leica fluorescent microscope. Quantification of Neurite Outgrowth—To study the differentiation morphology of PC12 cells when SAP was overexpressed, the length of the longest neurite and total neurite length of the SAP- or mock-transfected stable cell line was quantified. The length of neurites was recorded using MetaMorph version 5.0r1 software, and more than 200 individual cells were counted from randomly selected fields in three separate trials (n = 3). SAP Identified as a TrkB-interacting Protein in a Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—To study the postsynaptic function of TrkB, we have attempted to screen for TrkB-interacting protein using a postnatal day 12 mouse muscle cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The intracellular region of TrkB was used as bait. To verify whether TrkB expressed in yeast resulted in autophosphorylation of the receptor, wild type (WT) and the kinase-dead (KD) TrkB transformed yeast cells were collected and subjected to Western blot analysis. Our results showed that TrkB was tyrosine-phosphorylated only in the WT transformants and not in the KD transformants (Fig. 1A). This finding indicated that the bait used was expressed in an active conformation in yeast. Results from the yeast two-hybrid screen identified SAP as a TrkB-interacting protein in yeast. SAP encodes a 126-amino acid protein, which is comprised of a single SH2 domain (aa 1-103) and a short C-terminal tail (aa 104-126). The library clone of SAP encoded the full-length SAP protein (126 aa) with a short extra N-terminal sequence before the start codon. Deletion of the 5′ extra sequence did not interfere with TrkB and SAP association (data not shown), suggesting that full-length SAP can interact with TrkB in yeast. To map the TrkB binding region on SAP, truncated forms of SAP containing only the SH2 domain (aa 1-103) or the C-terminal tail (aa 104-126) were constructed. In the lift filter and the β-galactosidase activity assays, both the full-length SAP and the SH2 domain, but not the C-terminal tail, interacted with TrkB. In addition, SAP failed to associate with the KD mutant of TrkB in yeast (Fig. 1C). These observations suggest that the SH2 domain of SAP and tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkB were both required for the association between TrkB and SAP in yeast. We next proceeded to verify if the association between SAP and TrkB was also observed in mammalian cells. First of all, the purity of our in house SAP antibody was examined. We found that incubation of SAP antibody with lysates from thymus and SAP-overexpressing 293T cells resulted in a single band of ∼15 kDa in size, corresponding to the size of SAP. This band was not detected in mock-transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 1D). In addition, preincubation of blocking peptide with SAP antibody abolished the detection of SAP in Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D). These observations collectively suggest that our SAP antibody specifically detected SAP. To examine whether SAP and TrkB association occurs in mammalian cells, TrkB-WT or -KD was co-transfected with SAP into 293T cells, and the lysates were used for co-immunoprecipitation. Western blot analysis showed that only TrkB-WT, and not TrkB-KD, co-immunoprecipitated with SAP (Fig. 1E). Our observations therefore showed that in agreement with the yeast binding results, SAP interacted preferentially with phosphorylated TrkB. SAP Interacted with TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC in 293T Cells—To examine whether SAP interacted with other Trk family receptors, SAP was co-transfected with TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC in 293T cells, and the lysates were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Interestingly, SAP was found to co-immunoprecipitate with TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC when immunoprecipitation was performed with either pan-Trk antibody (Fig. 2A) or anti-SAP antibody (Fig. 2B). The interaction between SAP and Trk receptors was further verified by GST pull-down assays. GST or GST-SAP proteins were incubated with adult rat brain lysates. Only GST-SAP, but not GST, pulled down the endogenous Trk receptors from the lysates (Fig. 2C). Taken together, our findings demonstrated that SAP interacted with all three members of the Trk family. To examine whether the association between SAP and Trk receptors occur in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed using thymus lysate due to its abundant expression of both SAP and TrkA. Immunoprecipitation with either pan-Trk antibody (Fig. 2D, top) or anti-SAP antibody (Fig. 2D, bottom) both revealed that SAP co-immunoprecipitated with TrkA in the thymus. These analyses therefore demonstrated that SAP interacted with Trk receptors both in vitro and in vivo. SAP Transcripts Were Expressed in Brain and Muscle during Development—Since Trk receptors were observed to associate with SAP, we were interested to examine whether SAP was expressed in the tissues where Trk receptors are abundantly expressed. Among the Trk receptors, TrkB is highly expressed in the brain and also has been recently demonstrated to be expressed in muscles (25Middlemas D.S. Lindberg R.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 26Gonzalez M. Ruggiero F.P. Chang Q. Shi Y.J. Rich M.M. Kraner S. Balice-Gordon R.J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 567-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Using semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we found that SAP was also detected in the brain and muscle, although levels of expression were much lower in the brain compared with that in thymus (Fig. 3A). Moreover, SAP transcripts were detected throughout development in the brain, whereas expression of SAP was strongest in the muscle at postnatal day 1 (Fig. 3A). The detection of SAP expression in the brain prompted us to further explore whether SAP was detected in neurons. Using cortical neuronal cultures, we verified that SAP expression in the brain was at least partially attributable to SAP expression in neurons. In addition, we found that SAP was expressed in PC12 cells, although SAP transcript level was also much lower in PC12 cells and cortical neurons compared with that in thymus (Fig. 3B). To further explore whether SAP expression co-localized with TrkB, cortical neurons were double-stained against SAP and TrkB. We found that both TrkB and SAP immunoreactivities were observed in the cell body and neurites of the neurons, indicating that TrkB and SAP may co-localize in neurons (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these observations indicate that in addition to the immune system, SAP was also expressed at a lower level in muscle and neurons. SAP Interacted with Tyrosine 674 of the TrkB Receptor—Having verified that TrkB associated with SAP, we next proceeded to characterize the site of interaction on TrkB for SAP binding. Since tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkB was required for its association with SAP (Fig. 1), we speculated that the phosphorylated tyrosine residues may serve as docking sites for SAP. To examine this possibility, and to delineate the tyrosine residue for the interaction, five TrkB phosphorylation mutants (Y484F, Y670F, Y674F, Y675F, and Y785F) corresponding to the five major tyrosine phosphorylation sites we"

The source of the radiation resistance is not known, but an expansion of specific protein families related to stress response and damage control has been observed. DNA repair enzymes are among the expanded protein families in D. radiodurans, and genes encoding five different uracil-DNA glycosylases are identified in the genome. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase (MUG) from D. radiodurans (drMUG) to a resolution of 1.75 Å. Structural analyses suggest that drMUG possesses a novel catalytic residue, Asp-93. Activity measurements show that drMUG has a modified and broadened substrate specificity compared with Escherichia coli MUG. The importance of Asp-93 for activity was confirmed by structural analysis and abolished activity for the mutant drMUGD93A. Two other microorganisms, Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Rhodopseudomonas palustris, possess genes that encode MUGs with the highest sequence identity to drMUG among all of the bacterial MUGs examined. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that these three MUGs form a new MUG/thymidine-DNA glycosylase subfamily, here called the MUG2 family.

Uracil-DNA glycosylases are responsible for the removal of uracil from DNA as part of the base excision repair pathway. Uracil in DNA may result from misincorporation during replication or by deamination of cytosine resulting in A:U and G:U mismatches (1Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thymine DNA-glycosylase (TDG) removes uracil and thymine from G:U and G:T mismatches in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (8Neddermann P. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase (MUG) is the prokaryotic homologue of TDG, and Escherichia coli MUG (ecMUG) has been shown to be highly specific to G:U mismatches but also to repair G:T mismatches at very high enzyme concentrations. The crystal structure of ecMUG revealed that it consists of a central 5-stranded β-sheet flanked on both sides by α-helices and that ecMUG and human uracil-DNA N-glycosylase (hUNG) are structurally related (9Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Some of the same structural elements in hUNG and ecMUG are involved in catalysis; however, the catalytically important residues are different. The highly conserved 143GQDPYH148 sequence in the so-called water-activating loop in hUNG is substituted by 16GINPG20 in ecMUG (a conserved sequence motif among most MUG/TDGs), and the catalytic residue Asp-145 is substituted by Asn-18. In addition, the 268HPSPLS273 sequence in the highly conserved DNA intercalating loop (Leu-272 loop) in hUNG is substituted by 140NPSGLSR146 in ecMUG, and the catalytically important His-268 in hUNG is replaced by Asn-140 (9Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Leu-272 in hUNG is observed to fill the gap created in the DNA duplex when uracil is flipped out of the DNA strand and into the substrate-binding pocket (10Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). ecMUG contains a Leu residue (Leu-144) in a topologically similar position, and this residue is believed to have the same function (9Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition it has been shown that the neighboring residues Ser and Arg, the latter in particular, intercalate with the widowed guanine on the complementary DNA strand, and the contacts formed were thus thought to be specific in recognizing the guanine opposite of the mismatched uracil instead of uracil itself. Furthermore, ecMUG was found to be highly specific for dsDNA, as it does not excise uracil from single-stranded DNA (9Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). hUNG is suggested to perform the catalysis of the N-glycoside bond in a stepwise, dissociative manner. The cleavage of the glycosylic bond yields an intermediate that comprises an oxocarbenium cation and a uracilate anion. A subsequent attack by a water molecule and transfer of a proton to Asp-145 results in the products. The side chains of both Asp-145 and His-268 contribute to lowering the activation energy of the reaction by stabilizing the transition state. Asp-145 has been suggested to participate in stabilizing the oxocarbenium cation, whereas His-268 is thought to participate in the stabilization of the uracilate anion (11Dinner A.R. Blackburn G.M. Karplus M. Nature. 2001; 413: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In ecMUG, both Asp-145 and His-268 are substituted by asparagines (Asn-18 and Asn-140). Asn-18 in MUG, which is conserved in most known MUG/TDG sequences, binds and presents a water molecule in a similar position and orientation to the catalytic aspartate of hUNG and is aligned for nucleophilic attack on the deoxyribose in order for the catalysis to take place. Although there is a possibility that Asn-18 could participate in stabilizing the transition state in the MUG/TDG class of enzymes also, the residue corresponding to Asn-140 in ecMUG is poorly conserved throughout the MUG/TDG class of enzymes. Therefore, it has not been verified that the MUG/TDG enzymes follow the stepwise dissociative reaction pathway that is now commonly accepted for UNG. Even though some of the catalytic power of hUNG is retained in ecMUG, it is not able to perform the same efficient catalysis because of the lack of the enzymatic properties of Asp and His. This probably explains the observed low rate of uracil excision of ecMUG compared with hUNG (9Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Deinococcus radiodurans is a non-pathogenic soil bacterium well known for its extreme ability to withstand ultraviolet and ionizing radiation as well as desiccation. D. radiodurans tolerates ionizing radiation at doses lethal to other organisms and is capable of surviving 5,000–30,000 grays of ionizing radiation (12Minton K.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), whereas most other organisms cannot survive doses of above 50 grays. Such a massive radiation dose is estimated to induce several hundred double-strand breaks, thousands of single-strand gaps, and ∼1,000 sites of DNA base damage per chromosome (13Battista J.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 203-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In the case of acute radiation of ∼1,000 grays, D. radiodurans repairs its DNA efficiently within a few hours, whereas other organisms typically cannot tolerate more than two to three DNA radiation-induced double-strand breaks per chromosome (14Daly M.J. Minton K.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4461-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The fact that D. radiodurans is so resistant to radiation has made it an attractive target for studies on bio-remediation of radioactivity and/or chemically contaminated sites, and mainly for that reason the D. radiodurans genome was sequenced (15White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Richardson D.L. Moffat K.S. Qin H. Jiang L. Pamphile W. Crosby M. Shen M. Vamathevan J.J. Lam P. McDonald L. Utterback T. Zalewski C. Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Daly M.J. Fraser C.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Despite thorough biological studies of this organism, the mechanisms of the radiation resistance remains unclear; however an expansion of specific protein families related to stress response, damage control, and DNA repair is observed in D. radiodurans (16Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Minton K.W. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 44-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). DNA glycosylases are among the expanded protein families in D. radiodurans, and for the UDG family five UDG-encoding genes have been identified (16Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Minton K.W. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 44-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of D. radiodurans MUG (drMUG/DR0715) to 1.75-Å resolution and that of the mutant drMUGD93A to 1.7-Å resolution. The overall structure of drMUG is similar to that of E. coli MUG; however, drMUG possesses a novel catalytic residue (Asp-93) and has broader substrate specificity compared with E. coli MUG. Cloning—The gene encoding the G:U mismatch uracil-DNA glycosylase from D. radiodurans, dr0715, was inserted into the pDEST14 expression vector using the Gateway® technology according to the manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen). The primers used for amplification of the gene (Sigma Genosys) were the forward drMUG primer (5′-CATCACCATCACCATCACACTGCGCCGCATGACGTG-3′), the reverse drMUG primer (5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTACAGTACGGGGGTTTCCGG-3′), and the forward D. radiodurans His tag primer (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGAAGATAGAACCATGCATCACCATCACCATCAC-3′). The dr0715 gene was first amplified using the forward drMUG and reverse drMUG primers and thereafter using the forward D. radiodurans His tag and reverse drMUG primers in order to engineer 18 additional nucleotides encoding an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. The resulting PCR product was used in the BP reaction with the pDONR201 vector and in the LR reaction with the pDEST14 vector. The sequence of the clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI 377 DNA sequencer, Amersham Biosciences). The drMUGD93A mutant was constructed using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manual from the manufacturer (Stratagene). The primers used were the OPD93A primer (5′-GCGCCACAGCGGGGTGGCGGCCGCACTC-3′) and the NPD93A primer (5′-GAGTGCGGCCGCCACCCCGCTGTGGCGC-3′). The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification—The BL21(DE3)pLysS expression strain (Stratagene) was transformed with the pDEST14 vector containing dr0715 and dr0715D93A, respectively, and expression was induced for 3 h after the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The soluble fraction of the lysed cells was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap HP chelating Sepharose column charged with 100 mm NiSO4 equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. The proteins were eluted from the column using a gradient from 0–100% 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 500 mm imidazole and contained ∼200 mm imidazole. The proteins were thereafter concentrated to 10 mg/ml (drMUG) and 43 mg/ml (drMUGD93A) and stored at 4 °C. Protein Determination and Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined with Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent concentrate based on the Bradford dye binding procedure (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Protein purity was determined using SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE) with 4–12% Bis-Tris gels run in MES buffer. The gel was stained in Simply Blue SafeStain according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Specificity Measurements—Substrate specificity was measured using 30-bp dsDNA oligonucleotide substrates containing G:C, G:U, G:T, and A:U base pairs and one single-stranded DNA containing uracil labeled with fluorescein in the 5′-end (MWG Biotech AG). The dsDNA oligonucleotide had the sequence 5′-CCAACCGGCTATCGTGGCXGGCCACGACGG-3′ (18Liu P. Burdzy A. Sowers L.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) where the boldfaced X was either C, U, or T; in the reverse and the complementary strands, G or A was a partner to the X. Reactions between protein and DNA were performed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 pmol of DNA, 1 pmol of drMUG and drMUGD93A, and 1 unit of ecMUG (Nordic Biosite AB) in a 20-μl reaction mixture for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped, and the resulting abasic site was cleaved off by adding NaOH to a final concentration of 100 mm and incubating at 99 °C for 10 min; thereafter, it was analyzed on a denaturing 15% Tris borate-EDTA/urea PAGE (Invitrogen). The products were visualized using the UV light illumination of the Gel Doc 2000 system (Bio-Rad). Specific activity was measured using nick-translated calf thymus DNA (Sigma-Aldrich) with deoxy[5-3H]uridine 5′-triphosphate (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of substrate and measurement of activity were performed as described previously (19Lanes O. Guddal P.H. Gjellesvik D.R. Willassen N.P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2000; 127: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization was performed using the hanging drop method. Crystals of recombinant drMUG and drMUGD93A were grown by mixing 1-μl drops of 10 mg/ml protein with a solution containing 0.2 m sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate at pH 6.5, and 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (Crystal screen I, number 28; Hampton Research). The drops were equilibrated at 18 °C, and hexagonal crystals suitable for data collection purposes appeared after 1 day. The crystals had overall dimensions of about 80 × 80 × 80 μm3 and were flash-frozen directly from the drop using a nitrogen cold stream (Oxford Instruments) operating at a temperature of 100 K. All diffraction data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), macromolecular crystallography beamline ID14-EH4 (native) and ID14-EH1 (mutant). Complete data sets (see Table 2) were collected to a resolution of 1.75 and 1.7 Å for the native and mutant drMUGs, respectively. These data allowed the solution of both crystal structures using molecular replacement techniques.TABLE 2Data collection and refinement summarydrMUGdrMUGD93AData collection Resolution range (Å)12–1.75 (1.84–1.75)37.6–1.70 (1.79–1.70) Number of unique reflections22,68625,019 Redundancy5.3 (5.1)7.0 (6.7) Rmerge (%)5.4 (53.2)6.8 (59.6) Completeness (%)99.9 (100)99.8 (100) Mean I/σ(I)18.8 (2.8)18.3 (2.7)Refinement statistics R-value (%)17.920.8 Free R-value (%)22.024.4 Deviation from ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.0210.021Bond angles (°)1.9161.877 ESU (Å) (Rwork/Rfree)aESU, estimated standard uncertainty.

Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992: 27-33Google Scholar). The unit cell parameters of drMUG were a = b = 101.7Å, c = 37.6Å, α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°, and for drMUGD93A the parameters were a = b = 102.5Å, c = 37.6Å, α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°; both belong to the hexagonal space group P6. The data were scaled and merged, and the intensities were converted into structure factors using the CCP4 programs SCALA and TRUNCATE (21Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19761) Google Scholar). A summary of the data collection statistics is presented in Table 2. It was assumed that one molecule in the asymmetric unit leads to a solvent content of roughly 52%, with a Matthew's coefficient of 2.6 Å3 Da-1. Molecular replacement was performed using MOLREP (21Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19761) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of ecMUG (9Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) was used as an initial model for drMUG, and the automated program functions in MOLREP were applied to create the search model that presumably had the best fit to the sequence of drMUG. Reflections to a high resolution limit of 4 Å were used, and one well resolved solution could be found. Rigid body fitting of the model using a high-resolution cutoff at 3.5Å resulted in an Rwork of 48.9% (Rfree of 49.6%). Automated model building with ARP/wARP (22Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar), including all reflections to 1.75 Å, built a total of 177 amino acid residues in two chains into electron density. After manual intervention using O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar) the model was refined in REFMAC5 (24Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), resulting in R-factors of 23.5 and 27.1% for the working and test sets of reflections, respectively, including all reflections in the refinement. Subsequent cycles of refinement interspersed with manual rebuilding gave final Rwork and Rfree values of 17.9 and 22.0%, respectively, with acceptable geometry. The crystal structure of the drMUGD93A mutant was determined by molecular replacement with MOLREP (21Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19761) Google Scholar) using the refined structure of drMUG as a search model with water molecules, acetate, and Asp-93 removed. The model was refined as for drMUG with final Rwork and Rfree values of 20.8 and 24.4%, respectively, after refinement. For an overview of the refinement statistics, see Table 2. Protein Expression and Purification—The expression of the protein and its purification to apparent purity were confirmed by SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 1. The molecular mass of the purified protein seems to be larger than the theoretical mass 21.8 kDa, as judged from electrophoresis with the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The Overall Structure of drMUG—The refined model of drMUG comprises a single polypeptide chain where amino acid residues 7–189 are defined in electron density. No electron density was observed for the N-terminal residues 1–6 and the C-terminal residues 189–199. Two short loop regions in the structure were poorly defined in the initial electron density maps (residues 144–147 and 165–167) but could be built and were included in the subsequent refinement cycles. One acetate and 151 water molecules were also incorporated and used in refinement. The central part of the structure is a five-stranded β-sheet having a strand order of 2-1-3-5-4, with strand 4 antiparallel to the others. This β-sheet is flanked on both sides by α-helices (Fig. 2A). Overall, the crystal structure of drMUG is similar to the previously determined structure of ecMUG (Protein Data Bank code 1MUG), with a root mean square deviation of 1.15 Å for 146 aligned Cα-atoms (Fig. 2B). A pronounced positively charged cavity on the C-terminal side of the β-sheet has been shown to be contacting the damaged DNA in ecMUG (9Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). drMUG can also be structurally aligned with the crystal structure of unbound hUNG (Protein Data Bank code 2SSP) (25Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Slupphaug G. Bharati S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5214-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) with an root mean square deviation of 1.74 Å for 64 Cα-atoms. The most similar residues are as expected in the central β-sheet and in the DNA contacting region. A planar, Y-shaped electron density was situated in the substrate-binding site. This moiety was modeled as an acetate molecule, consistent with the high concentrations of acetate used in the crystallization of drMUG. The acetate is tightly coordinated by Asp-84 in the bottom of the substrate-binding pocket (Fig. 3). Compared with the crystal structure of ecMUG complexed with the non-hydrolyzable deoxyuridine analogue β-FU (26Barrett T.E. Scharer O.D. Savva R. Brown T. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6599-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the acetate in drMUG is situated much deeper in the substrate-binding pocket (not shown). This tight interaction is made possible by the substitution of Lys-68 in ecMUG by Asp-84 in drMUG. It has further been suggested that ecMUG possesses a so-called “back door” escape route for excised bases, as the bottom of the substrate-binding pocket is open and connects to the surface close to the N terminus of the protein (26Barrett T.E. Scharer O.D. Savva R. Brown T. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6599-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In drMUG this hypothesized escape route is closed because it has 16 additional N-terminal residues as compared with ecMUG (Fig. 4). In the crystal structure, the longer N-terminal part of drMUG forms a lid that eliminates the possibility for a cleaved base to escape via this route (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 4Sequence alignment of drMUG, ecMUG, drUNG, hUNG, and E. coli UNG (ecUNG). The secondary structure elements of drMUG are indicated above the alignment, and those of ecUNG are indicated below. Identical residues for all sequences are indicated as white letters on red background, whereas equivalent residues are shown as red letters in blue boxes. Equivalent residues only shared between the MUG enzymes are shown in green, whereas equivalent residues for the UNG enzymes are shown in red. Residues particularly important for catalysis are outlined on a gray background.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nucleotide Stabilization and Discrimination—To perform efficient glycoside bond cleavage, drMUG must stabilize the mismatched uracil in the specificity pocket. Additional mechanisms should be in place to allow discrimination against thymine and cytosine. The nucleotide stabilization is most likely provided by Tyr-46 in drMUG (Fig. 4). An analysis of the crystal structure shows that this residue will make stacking interaction with the flipped-out nucleotide in the specificity pocket (Fig. 5). A sequence alignment of drMUG, ecMUG, and three UNG sequences reveals that the equivalent residues in hUNG and ecMUG is Phe-158 and Phe-30, respectively (Fig. 4). A superimposition of the specificity pockets of drMUG and ecMUG shows how Tyr-46 in drMUG and Phe-30 in ecMUG can stack against the nucleotide (Fig. 5). A ClustalW alignment (27Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55712) Google Scholar) of the 15 sequences with the highest identity to drMUG was made in ExPASy (28Gasteiger E. Gattiker A. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (3453) Google Scholar). From the alignment, it is clear that drMUG is rather similar to the eukaryotic TDGs (Fig. 6). It is also apparent that the amino acid in position 46 is strictly conserved as an aromatic residue throughout the MUG/TDG family. This aromatic interaction thus appears to be conserved among UNG and MUG/TDG enzymes as a mechanism of substrate stabilization in the specificity pocket. Binding of thymine in the activity pocket is probably prevented by Ser-36 and Ser-39 in drMUG (Fig. 4). The crystal structure suggests that the side chains of both these two Ser residues would prevent thymine from binding in the active site of drMUG by a steric hindrance of the methyl group (Fig. 5). In ecMUG Ser-36 is substituted by Gly-20, whereas Ser-39 is conserved as Ser-23 (Fig. 4)."

This Policy Forum reports on an empirical study of how judges would analyze these issues. The authors discuss the challenges these types of cases will bring to the court-room and suggest a series of questions that judges should consider in evaluating the need for genetic information in legal cases."
