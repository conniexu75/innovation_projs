https://openalex.org/W1976441097,"A mechanism by which the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway mediates growth factor-dependent cell survival was characterized. The MAPK-activated kinases, the Rsks, catalyzed the phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD at serine 112 both in vitro and in vivo. The Rsk-induced phosphorylation of BAD at serine 112 suppressed BAD-mediated apoptosis in neurons. Rsks also are known to phosphorylate the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) at serine 133. Activated CREB promoted cell survival, and inhibition of CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 triggered apoptosis. These findings suggest that the MAPK signaling pathway promotes cell survival by a dual mechanism comprising the posttranslational modification and inactivation of a component of the cell death machinery and the increased transcription of pro-survival genes."
https://openalex.org/W2162703129,"In sexual transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus, and early and later stages of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) infection, both viruses were found to replicate predominantly in CD4(+) T cells at the portal of entry and in lymphoid tissues. Infection was propagated not only in activated and proliferating T cells but also, surprisingly, in resting T cells. The infected proliferating cells correspond to the short-lived population that produces the bulk of HIV-1. Most of the HIV-1-infected resting T cells persisted after antiretroviral therapy. Latently and chronically infected cells that may be derived from this population pose challenges to eradicating infection and developing an effective vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2008366157,"An understanding of how T cell memory is maintained is crucial for the rational design of vaccines. Memory T cells were shown to persist indefinitely in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-deficient mice and retained the ability to make rapid cytokine responses upon reencounter with antigen. In addition, memory CD8 T cells, unlike naïve cells, divided without MHC-T cell receptor interactions. This ""homeostatic"" proliferation is likely to be important in maintaining memory T cell numbers in the periphery. Thus, after naïve CD8 T cells differentiate into memory cells, they evolve an MHC class I-independent ""life-style"" and do not require further stimulation with specific or cross-reactive antigen for their maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1967400782,"The p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), also called Erk2 and Erk1, respectively, have been implicated in proliferation as well as in differentiation programs. The specific role of the p44 MAPK isoform in the whole animal was evaluated by generation of p44 MAPK-deficient mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. The p44 MAPK –/– mice were viable, fertile, and of normal size. Thus, p44 MAPK is apparently dispensable and p42 MAPK (Erk2) may compensate for its loss. However, in p44 MAPK −/− mice, thymocyte maturation beyond the CD4 + CD8 + stage was reduced by half, with a similar diminution in the thymocyte subpopulation expressing high levels of T cell receptor (CD3 high ). In p44 MAPK −/− thymocytes, proliferation in response to activation with a monoclonal antibody to the T cell receptor in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate was severely reduced even though activation of p42 MAPK was more sustained in these cells. The p44 MAPK apparently has a specific role in thymocyte development."

https://openalex.org/W2046566365,"Transcriptional coactivators have been viewed as constitutively active components, using transcription factors mainly to localize their functions. Here, it is shown that PPARgamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1) promotes transcription through the assembly of a complex that includes the histone acetyltransferases steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and CREB binding protein (CBP)/p300. PGC-1 has a low inherent transcriptional activity when it is not bound to a transcription factor. The docking of PGC-1 to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) stimulates an apparent conformational change in PGC-1 that permits binding of SRC-1 and CBP/p300, resulting in a large increase in transcriptional activity. Thus, transcription factor docking switches on the activity of a coactivator protein."

The crystal structure of the catalytic hect domain of E6AP reveals a bilobal structure with a broad catalytic cleft at the junction of the two lobes. The cleft consists of conserved residues whose mutation interferes with ubiquitin-thioester bond formation and is the site of Angelman syndrome mutations. The crystal structure of the E6AP hect domain bound to the UbcH7 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) reveals the determinants of E2-E3 specificity and provides insights into the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the E3."

https://openalex.org/W2058848453,"Heterotrimeric G-protein signaling systems are activated via cell surface receptors possessing the seven-membrane span motif. Several observations suggest the existence of other modes of stimulus input to heterotrimeric G-proteins. As part of an overall effort to identify such proteins we developed a functional screen based upon the pheromone response pathway in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We identified two mammalian proteins, AGS2 and AGS3 (activators of G-proteinsignaling), that activated the pheromone response pathway at the level of heterotrimeric G-proteins in the absence of a typical receptor. β-galactosidase reporter assays in yeast strains expressing different Gα subunits (Gpa1, G<sub>s</sub>α, G<sub>i</sub>α<sub>2</sub><sub>(Gpa1(1–41))</sub>, G<sub>i</sub>α<sub>3(Gpa1(1–41))</sub>, Gα<sub>16(Gpa1(1–41))</sub>) indicated that AGS proteins selectively activated G-protein heterotrimers. AGS3 was only active in the G<sub>i</sub>α<sub>2</sub> and G<sub>i</sub>α<sub>3</sub>genetic backgrounds, whereas AGS2 was active in each of the genetic backgrounds except Gpa1. In protein interaction studies, AGS2 selectively associated with Gβγ, whereas AGS3 bound Gα and exhibited a preference for GαGDP <i>versus</i> GαGTPγS. Subsequent studies indicated that the mechanisms of G-protein activation by AGS2 and AGS3 were distinct from that of a typical G-protein-coupled receptor. AGS proteins provide unexpected mechanisms for input to heterotrimeric G-protein signaling pathways. AGS2 and AGS3 may also serve as novel binding partners for Gα and Gβγ that allow the subunits to subserve functions that do not require initial heterotrimer formation."
https://openalex.org/W1995924138,"Humic substances (HSs) are the natural organic polyelectrolytes formed from the biochemical weathering of plant and animal remains. Their macromolecular structure and chemistry determine their role in biogeochemical processes. In situ spectromicroscopic evidence showed that the HS macromolecular structures (size and shape) vary as a function of HS origin (soil versus fluvial), solution chemistry, and the associated mineralogy. The HSs do not simply form coils in acidic or strong electrolyte solutions and elongated structures in dilute alkaline solutions. The macromolecular structural changes of HSs are likely to modify contaminant solubility, biotransformation, and the carbon cycle in soils and sediments."

A new broad-toothed genus of Neocomian age ( approximately 135 million years ago) shows few of the specializations of other Cretaceous sauropods. A new small-bodied sauropod of Aptian-Albian age ( approximately 110 million years ago), in contrast, reveals the highly modified cranial form of rebbachisaurid diplodocoids. Rates of skeletal change in sauropods and other major groups of dinosaurs are estimated quantitatively and shown to be highly variable."
https://openalex.org/W2326732193,"The MMTV/neu transgenic (Tg) mice spontaneously develop mammary tumors stochastically after a long latent period, suggesting that the c-neu/erbB2 oncogene is not sufficient for tumor formation. To identify putative collaborator(s) of the c-neu/erbB2, we used the provirus insertional mutagenesis approach with mammary tumors arising in MMTV/neu Tg mice infected with the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). The Notch1 gene was identified as a novel target for MMTV provirus insertional activation. In Notch1-rearranged tumors, the Notch1 gene was interrupted by the MMTV provirus insertion upstream of the exons coding for the TM domain. These insertions led to overexpression of novel 5' truncated approximately 7 kb RNA coding for 280 kDa mutant protein harboring only the Notch1 ectodomain, N(EC)mut. These may be involved in tumor formation. Another consequence of these insertions was the expression of truncated 3' Notch1 transcripts (3.5 - 4.5 kb) and proteins (86 - 110 kDa) deleted of most of the extracellular sequences (Notch1intra). We found that 3' truncated Notch1intra can transform HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells in vitro. Deletion analysis revealed that the ankyrin-repeats and the domain 1 (aa 1751 - 1821) are required, while a signal peptide, the two conserved cysteines (C1652 and C1685) and the OPA and PEST sequences are dispensable for transformation. These results indicate that the N-terminally truncated Notch1intra protein behaves as an oncogene in this system."

https://openalex.org/W2122631210,"Human leukocytes can express the P2X(7) purinergic receptor, an ionic channel gated by extracellular ATP, for which the physiological role is only partially understood. Transfection of P2X(7) cDNA into lymphoid cells that lack this receptor sustains their proliferation in serum-free medium. Increased proliferation of serum-starved P2X(7) transfectants is abolished by the P2X(7) receptor blocker oxidized ATP or by the ATP hydrolase apyrase. Both wild type and P2X(7)-transfected lymphoid cells release large amounts of ATP into the culture medium. These data suggest the operation of an ATP-based autocrine/paracrine loop that supports lymphoid cell growth in the absence of serum-derived growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2051119776,"The Na+,K+-ATPase catalyzes the active transport of ions. It has two necessary subunits, α and β, but in kidney it is also associated with a 7.4-kDa protein, the γ subunit. Stable transfection was used to determine the effect of γ on Na,K-ATPase properties. When isolated from either kidney or transfected cells, αβγ had lower affinities for both Na+ and K+ than αβ. A post-translational modification of γ selectively eliminated the effect on Na+ affinity, suggesting three configurations (αβ, αβγ, and αβγ*) conferring different stable properties to Na,K-ATPase.

N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction The renal control of Na+ and K+ balance is complex and entails ensembles of apical and basolateral transporters that play specialized roles in different segments of the nephron. One of the most physiologically important transporters is the Na,K-ATPase, or sodium pump, which is crucial for the absorptive, secretory, and concentrating capacity of the kidney. Small changes in Na,K-ATPase ion affinities can have important physiological effects both directly on transepithelial ion and fluid transport and indirectly through the ion gradients used by other transporters (1Doucet A. Kidney Int. 1992; 37: S118-S124Google Scholar, 2Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In permeabilized microdissected nephron segments, Na,K-ATPase has increased affinity for Na+ in thick ascending limb compared with proximal convoluted tubule and has still higher affinity in cortical collecting tubule (3Barlet Bas C.

A small single-span membrane protein, member of a protein family that has ion channel activity in oocytes, copurifies with renal Na,K-ATPase α and β subunits and appears as a doublet on gels (13Forbush III, B.

It has been reported to increase ATP affinity when expressed in mammalian cells (18Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol.

Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Here evidence is presented for its role in the control of the most basic property of Na,K-ATPase, the affinity for Na+ and K+. Most significantly, analysis of independent clones points to a functional role for post-translational modification of the γ subunit. Na,K-ATPase was purified from rat, pig, and dog kidney by SDS extraction (21Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), which produces membrane bound, active enzyme. Crude membranes from renal cell lines and transfectants were treated with SDS at 0.56 mg/mg protein and sedimented on 7–30% sucrose gradients. Specific activities of the Na,K-ATPase from rat kidney and NRK-52E cells were 1200–1500 and 120–150 μmol of Pi/mg/hr, respectively. Electrophoresis was in SDS-Tricine1 gels (22Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, incubated with antibodies, and detection was with chemiluminescence (23Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23407-23417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A rabbit antiserum (RCT-G1) was raised against the peptide corresponding to the last 14 amino acids (CGGSKKHRQVNEDEL) of rat γ, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Na,K-ATPase activity was measured in media containing 3 mm Tris-ATP, 3 mmMgCl2, 30 mm histidine, pH 7.3, and various concentrations of Na+ (0–20 mm) with [K+] fixed at 20 mm, or various concentrations of K+ (0–4 mm) with [Na+] fixed at 140 mm. Reactions were performed for 30 min at 37 °C with and without 3 mmouabain, and ouabain-sensitive Pi release was measured colorimetrically. cDNA for the γ subunit was obtained by RT-PCR from total rat kidney RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The following primers were based on a nucleotide sequence for rat γ in the GenBankTM dbEST data base (AA801241) plus EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites for unidirectional cloning: forward primer, 5′-GGAATTCGTGGCTGGGGAAATGAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGCGGATCCCAGCTCATCTTCATTGAC-3′. Gel-purified DNA was ligated into pIRES vector (CLONTECH). Several clones containing the full-length cDNA of γ were verified by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. The N-terminal protein sequence is predicted to be MTELSANHGGS, corresponding to the corrected sequence reported by Minoret al. (14Minor N.T. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and different from that deposited in GenBankTM (X70062). Transfection was with cationic liposomes (Clonfectin, CLONTECH). Antibiotic (G418) was added after 48 h, and resistant colonies formed in 15–20 days. Cryostat sections were made from rat kidney fixed with periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde. Sections were double-labeled with mouse anti-α1 (McK1, 1:4) and rabbit anti-γ (RCT-G1, 1:500), stained with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, and examined with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 Laser Sharp confocal microscope. While Na,K-ATPase from kidney contains γ, this is not true of mammalian kidney cell lines (18Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32624-32628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (128) Google Scholar). NRK-52E, an epithelial line of rat kidney cells, expressed the same Na,K-ATPase α1 and β1 isoforms found in rat kidney, but γ could not be detected with specific antibodies (Fig.1) or by RT-PCR (not shown). The Na+ and K+ affinities of partially purified Na,K-ATPase with and without γ were compared (TableI, top). The apparent affinities for both ions were substantially higher (1.5–2-fold) in enzyme from NRK-52E (α1β1) than from renal medulla (α1β1γ). Two other renal cell lines, LLC-PK1 (pig) and MDCK (dog), also lacked γ (not shown), and again cell-derived enzyme without γ had higher affinities for Na+ than renal enzyme with it (Table I, top).Table IIon affinities for ATP hydrolysis by Na,K-ATPase with and without γγK0.5Na+Hill coefficientK0.5K+Hill coefficientnmmmmKidney vs. cell lines Rat kidney+8.39 ± 0.492.3 ± 0.20.85 ± 0.091.7 ± 0.14 NRK-52E−5.41 ± 0.121.9 ± 0.10.44 ± 0.032.0 ± 0.024 Pig kidney+9.54 ± 0.562.1 ± 0.23 LLC-PK1−4.75 ± 0.252.5 ± 0.33 Dog kidney+8.23 ± 0.392.4 ± 0.23 MDCK−5.32 ± 0.381.8 ± 0.23NRK-52E transfectants Mock-transfected−5.27 ± 0.171.9 ± 0.10.43 ± 0.0271.8 ± 0.13 Doublet+7.79 ± 0.292.1 ± 0.10.69 ± 0.0361.8 ± 0.016 Upper band+4.75 ± 0.242.5 ± 0.10.71 ± 0.041.8 ± 0.034Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the Sigma Plot Scientific Graph System (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA).

Open table in a new tab Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the Sigma Plot Scientific Graph System (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Na+ and K+ activation curves were fitted according to a cooperative model for ligand binding, v =V m [S] n /(K n + [S] n ), where S is the concentration of the activating cation (Na+ or K+) and n is the Hill coefficient. To determine whether γ was responsible for the kinetic difference, stable transfectants of NRK-52E were generated. Expression of γ was detected on Western blots (Fig. 1). By densitometric analysis, the level was 15–20% of the level in the kidney enzyme, normalized to the amount of α1. Two groups of clones were distinguished by the mobility of γ: those expressing a doublet (as in kidney preparations) and those expressing only the band with slower mobility. The distinction between clones proved to be critical for the kinetic properties of the Na,K-ATPase. The clones that expressed a γ doublet showed reduced affinity for Na+ as well as K+, while the clones with only one band showed reduced affinity for K+only (Fig. 2). This relationship held true in three independent clones with doublets and three clones with single bands. The ion affinities for all of the tested clones are compared in Table I, bottom. In the literature, doublets of mammalian γ appeared during in vitro synthesis in the presence of pancreatic microsomes (17Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III, B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), but not in their absence (20Beguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), which suggests that there might be post-translational processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. The γ subunit does not have a signal sequence, but trypsin treatment of pig kidney right-side-out sealed microsomal vesicles reduced the doublet to a single band, consistent with a cleavage site near the extracellular N terminus (18Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32624-32628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We digested right-side-out rat renal medulla vesicles with trypsin (24Arystarkhova E. Gibbons D.L. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8785-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both bands of the γ doublet were reduced to one smaller band, from 7.6 and 6.8 kDa to 5.6 kDa (Fig.3 a), predicting cleavage at Lys-13, analogous to the cleavage of pig γ in extensively digested purified enzyme (25Or E. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The disappearance of the doublet implies that the modification lies extracellularly in the first 13 amino acids (MTELSANHGGSAK). Hydroxylamine treatment was used to determine whether the modification was because of acylation of the protein (23Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23407-23417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Bizzozero O.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At basic pH, hydroxylamine shifted the slower-migrating band but left the faster-migrating band unchanged (Fig. 3 b). At neutral pH neither band was affected (not shown), and there is no Asn-Gly in the sequence for hydroxylamine to cleave (27Bornstein P. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 2408-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This suggests a hydroxyester linkage, possibly fatty acid acylation, to Ser or Thr. There are three Ser and Thr residues in the N-terminal segment that are conserved in γ from rat, human, and mouse. Modification of Lys-13 is unlikely because trypsin still cleaved, but modification of the N terminus was not ruled out. The Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit in kidney is also modified by a group that is labile to basic hydroxylamine, but this modification is intracellular (23Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23407-23417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We examined the distribution of γ in rat kidney by double-label confocal microscopy, using the α1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase for comparison because Na,K-ATPase is known to be expressed at higher levels in some nephron segments than in others (Fig. 4). The anti-γ antibodies were raised against the C terminus and should detect γ forms with or without the posttranslational modification. Distal convoluted tubule (DCT) stained brightly for both α1 and γ, and proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) stained weakly for both. Other segments, however, including cortical thick ascending limb (CTAL) and some, but not all, cortical collecting tubules (CCT) (not shown), expressed α1 without any γ detected above the background of secondary antibody stain. Thus the expression of γ is segment-specific in the rat nephron. The most notable consequence of γ expression was that the affinities of the Na,K-ATPase for its substrates, Na+ and K+, could be modified independently. In clones expressing the doublet, as well as enzyme purified from renal medulla (which has the doublet), affinities for both ions were reduced in concert. This is not easy to explain by a shift between Na,K-ATPase E1-E2 conformations as suggested by Blostein and co-workers (19Therien A.G. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol.

The stoichiometry of γ relative to α was lower than in renal medullary Na,K-ATPase, however, which raises the question of whether γ acts exclusively as a subunit. γ has been shown to form an ion channel in the absence of α (14Minor N.T. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has not been ruled out that the observed effects on ion affinities result from an indirect modulatory pathway activated by its presence. NRK-52E is morphologically heterogeneous, lending credibility to the idea that subclones may have different phenotypes with respect to γ modification. It is intriguing that the clones with fully modified γ have alteration of K+ affinity alone, while the half-modified clones show alteration of both ion affinities. The modification appears to nullify a major functional consequence of association with γ. The anatomical distribution of γ is consistent with Na+affinities measured in different nephron segments: the presence of γ is accompanied by lower affinity for Na+. This suggests that expression of γ selectively modifies Na,K-ATPase propertiesin vivo. Whether the post-translational modification demonstrated here has a specific cellular distribution among γ-positive nephron segments remains to be determined. Pathways that alter ion affinities of kidney Na,K-ATPase consequent to hormone treatment or electrolyte dietary restriction have been reported (4Feraille E. Carranza M.L. Rousselot M. Favre H. Am. J.

Regardless of whether γ acts as a subunit or a channel, the evidence here indicates that it is an important contributor to the control of renal transport physiology.

Desmin-related myopathy is one of several diseases characterized by the coaggregation of intermediate filaments with αB-crystallin, and it identifies intermediate filaments as important physiological substrates for αB-crystallin. Using recombinant human αB-crystallin, the effects of the disease-causing mutation R120G upon the structure and the chaperone activities of αB-crystallin are reported. The secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structural features of αB-crystallin are all altered by the mutation as deduced by near- and far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, and chymotryptic digestion assays. The R120G αB-crystallin is also less stable than wild type αB-crystallin to heat-induced denaturation. These structural changes coincide with a significant reduction in thein vitro chaperone activity of the mutant αB-crystallin protein, as assessed by temperature-induced protein aggregation assays. The mutation also significantly altered the interaction of αB-crystallin with intermediate filaments. It abolished the ability of αB-crystallin to prevent those filament-filament interactions required to induce gel formation while increasing αB-crystallin binding to assembled intermediate filaments. These activities are closely correlated to the observed disease pathologies characterized by filament aggregation accompanied by αB-crystallin binding.

A characteristic disease pathology links the different causes of DRM, which consists of aggregates of intermediate filaments containing αB-crystallin present in the muscle cells of affected individuals (3Vicart P.

These aggregates are typically co-associated with αB-crystallin (7Lowe J. McDermott H. Pike I. Spendlove I. Landon M. Mayer R.J. J. Pathol. 1992; 166: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) despite the fact that they involve different intermediate filament proteins. This suggests that the association of αB-crystallin with intermediate filament aggregates is independent of the specific intermediate filament protein but is rather a generic response to this pathological rearrangement of intermediate filaments. These data establish a clear link between αB-crystallin, intermediate filaments, and the disease-induced aggregation of intermediate filaments (8Quinlan R. van den IJssel P. Nat.

These studies mimic the role of sHSPs in stressed cells, but they do not identify the physiological targets or the role of sHSPs in unstressed cells.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), αB-crystallin is found associated with intermediate filaments. In the eye lens, there is a unique cytoskeletal filament that is a stable complex of α-crystallin, comprising both αB- and αA-crystallin, and lens intermediate filaments (28Carter J.M. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This is called the beaded filament. Similar structures can be generated in vitro under appropriate coassembly conditions (29Quinlan R.A. Carter J.M. Sandilands A. Prescott A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 123-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These studies show that the association of sHSPs with intermediate filament networks is not just a stress-induced event (30Djabali K. deNechaud B. Landon F. Portier M.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but is a feature of normal cells, and suggest a general role for sHSPs in intermediate filament biology. Small HSPs bind to assembly competent intermediate filament proteins. This was demonstrated in the lens where a soluble complex of α-crystallin and intermediate filament proteins was immunopurified from lens cytosol (27Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 31Muchowski P.J. Valdez M.M. Clark J.I. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 951-958PubMed Google Scholar). It was subsequently demonstrated that sHSPs could inhibit GFAP as well as vimentin assembly in vitro(27Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). These data indicated that the association of sHSPs with intermediate filament proteins is not restricted to the filamentous form, but includes soluble intermediate filament complexes. From these observations, it is clear that sHSPs have the potential to influence intermediate filament assembly (29Quinlan R.A. Carter J.M. Sandilands A. Prescott A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 123-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, another aspect of the interaction of sHSPs with intermediate filaments was identified (32Perng M.D. Cairns L. van den IJssel P. Prescott A. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2099-2112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a simple viscosity-based assay, sHSPs were shown to prevent gel formation by intermediate filaments, presumably by blocking non-covalent filament-filament interactions (32Perng M.D. Cairns L. van den IJssel P. Prescott A. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2099-2112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggested a physiologically important link between intermediate filaments and sHSPs. In a cellular context, this link may prevent inappropriate interactions between bundled intermediate filaments (32Perng M.D. Cairns L. van den IJssel P. Prescott A. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2099-2112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Abrogation of this sHSP function could lead to intermediate filament aggregate formation. This is not only relevant to DRM but also to other human diseases where this phenotype is a pathological hallmark such as Alexander's disease. In this study, the structural and functional properties of the R120G αB-crystallin are compared with those of the wild type protein. Using several different in vitro assays, the effect of the mutation upon the chaperone activity of αB-crystallin has been studied. The UVCD, size exclusion chromatography and proteolysis studies all suggest that the mutation has affected the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure of αB-crystallin. The mutation also causes a significant reduction in the heat-induced denaturation and a reduction the in vitro chaperone activity of the protein. In order to understand how the αB-crystallin mutation could cause intermediate filament aggregation as seen in DRM, its effect upon the association with intermediate filaments was studied. The data show that R120G αB-crystallin was incapable of preventing filament-filament interactions that lead to the formation of an intermediate filament gel in vitro. This was accompanied by an apparent increase in the binding of R120G αB-crystallin to intermediate filaments. These data suggest that DRM resulting from the R120G mutation in αB-crystallin occurs as a progressive accumulation of intermediate filament aggregates brought about by the altered interaction of αB-crystallin with intermediate filaments. Total RNA was isolated from a sample of human soleus muscle (RNeasy kit, Qiagen) and converted into cDNA (Life Technologies, Inc.; Superscript kit). Human αB-crystallin cDNA was amplified from this cDNA using oligonucleotides 5′-AGCCACCATGGACATCGC-3′ and 5′-CTATTTCTTGGGGGCTGCG-3′ as forward and reverse primer, respectively. The amplified product was cloned into the vector pGEM®-T Easy (Promega) and the sequence confirmed against the GenBank™ data base entry (accession no.S45630). The R120G mutation was introduced by two-step polymerase chain reaction using the pGEM-T Easy human αB-crystallin wild type vector as a template in the first amplification reaction. Overlapping, complementary oligonucleotides were constructed containing the desired A → G mutation at nucleotide position 358 as well as a silent A → G mutation at nucleotide position 363, 5′-TTCCACGGGAAGTACCGGATCCCAGC-3′ and 5′-CCGGTACTTCCCGTGGAACTCCCTGGAGATGAA-3′. Using all four oligonucleotides the mutated αB-crystallin cDNA was created in two consecutive amplifications, then subcloned. After verification of the sequences both the wild type and R120G αB-crystallin cDNAs were subcloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the vector pET23b (Novagen). Recombinant human αB-crystallins were expressed in BL21plysS(DE3) in the expression vector pET23b. Recombinant protein expression was induced using 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h once the cultures had reached an OD600 of 0.6. Harvested bacterial pellets were resuspended in TEN buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.1% v/v of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and lysed by several freeze/thaw cycles. A supernatant fraction containing the soluble proteins including the recombinant sHSPs was prepared by centrifuging the lysate at 15,000 rpm in a JA20 rotor at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was then dialyzed against column buffer. GFAP was purified from porcine spinal cord by axonal flotation as described previously (33Ralton J.E. Lu X. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1935-1948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GFAP was then separated from the other neuronal intermediate filament proteins using DE52 (Whatman) in 8 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, and 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were eluted with a 0–200 mm NaCl linear gradient. All column procedures were carried out at room temperature. Recombinant αB-crystallin was purified by both non-denaturing (34Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and denaturing methods. In the latter, two diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) column steps were used. The supernatant fraction obtained from the bacteria was loaded onto the first column comprising TSK-DEAE 650M (Merck Ltd.) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF and eluted with a 20–250 mm NaCl gradient. The sHSP-enriched fractions were pooled and dialyzed into buffer containing 6 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF. This was then loaded onto a DE52 column equilibrated in the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a 0–200 mm NaCl gradient. All column steps were carried out at 4 °C. Column fractions were checked for homogeneity by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay. Analytical size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a Biosep-SEC-S4000, 7-μm, 300 × 7.8-mm column using a Hewlett-Packard high performance liquid chromatograph with the following mobile phase: 0.1m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 and 0.2 m NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. High molecular weight protein standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to calibrate the column. The standard deviation of the molecular masses of wild type αB-crystallin/αB-crystallin mutants was determined from the peak width at its half-height in six independent experiments. Proteolysis of wild type αB-crystallin/αB-crystallin mutants was performed as described previously (22Muchowski P.J. Wu G.J. Liang J.J. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Muchowski P.J. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Clark J.I. J. Biol.

Sci. 1989; 30: 2065-2068PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sun T.X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The presented CD spectra are the average of 16 scans, smoothed by polynomial curve fitting. The fit was checked with a statistical test so that the original data was not over-smoothed. To calculate molar ellipticity, a residue molecular weight of 115 was assumed. The proteins were dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH7.1) and used at concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml for far- and near-UVCD, respectively, as determined from calculated extinction coefficients based on a protein amino acid sequence as described previously (38Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 39Sun T.X. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The pathlength of the cells was 10 mm for near-UVCD and 1.0 mm for far-UVCD spectroscopy. Temperature-dependent precipitation of wild type and R120G αB-crystallin was measured in a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature controlled cuvette holder. The rate of temperature increase was 0.1 °C/min. Proteins were dialyzed into 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1, and the concentration adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml prior to the assay. First derivative calculation was used to determine the temperature at which 50% precipitation had occurred. Temperature-induced aggregation assays using citrate synthase (10Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and alcohol dehydrogenase (11Takemoto L. Emmons T. Horwitz J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) as target proteins were performed as described (13Muchowski P.J. Clark J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 40Muchowski P.J. Bassuk J.A. Lubsen N.H. Clark J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2578-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The sedimentation assay as developed by Nicholl and Quinlan (27Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) was used to assess the ability of sHSPs to inhibit intermediate filament assembly. Purified porcine GFAP was used for these studies. αB-crystallins were added to GFAP in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol prior to the assembly assay. The final dialysis was against assembly buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl. The experiments were performed at room temperature. Dialysates were layered onto a 0.85 m sucrose cushion in the assembly buffer and centrifuged at 80,000 ×g for 30 min at 20 °C in a Beckman TLA-55 rotor using a TL100 benchtop ultracentrifuge. The pellet and supernatant fractions were compared by SDS-PAGE as described previously (27Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). For the intermediate filament binding assay, αB-crystallins were again mixed with GFAP in 8 m urea, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm2-mercaptoethanol and then stepwise dialyzed into 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Assembly of the GFAP intermediate filaments and binding of the αB-crystallins was then induced by addition of a 20-fold concentrated binding buffer (BB) to give a final concentration of 100 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm DTT and incubation at the indicated temperature. The gel formation assay was based upon a method used to monitor actin binding protein activity by falling ball viscometry (41MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Filament assembly was promoted exactly as described for the binding assay by addition of the 20-fold concentrated BB. 100 μl of sample was loaded into a glass tube to be used in the viscosity assay. This was then immersed in a 37 °C water bath for 1 h prior to conducting the gel formation assay. A ball was then placed into the tube, and the ability of the solution to support the ball was monitored. Protein samples were diluted to 100–200 μg/ml, and negatively stained using 1% w/v uranyl acetate. Grids were examined in a Jeol 1200EX TEM, using an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. The effect of the disease causing mutation R120G on the structure of αB-crystallin was examined using near- and far-UVCD spectroscopy. The wild type and mutant αB-crystallin were expressed in Escherichia coli using a pET-based vector system and purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography. The sample purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and is presented in Fig. 1. Using recombinantly produced proteins, the far-UVCD spectrum (200–250 nm) was measured for both wild type and mutant αB-crystallin (Fig.2, A and B). At 25 °C (Fig. 2 A), the far-UVCD spectrum of wild type αB-crystallin contained a peak minimum at approximately 215 nm that is consistent with previous UVCD analyses showing a high percentage of β-sheet/β-turn structure in αB-crystallin (34Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 37Sun T.X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol.

Acta. 1985; 832: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When tested under identical conditions, the R120G mutant displayed a peak minimum that was shifted to a slightly shorter wavelength and had a significant (44%) increase in negative molar ellipticity in comparison to wild type αB-crystallin at 220 nm (Fig. 2 A). A second measurement was made for both proteins at 45 °C to assess protein stability at temperatures utilized in the chaperone assays (Fig.2 B). While the magnitude of the peak minimum (215 nm) for wild type αB-crystallin increased approximately 22% at 45 °C, there was no increase for the R120G mutant (Fig. 2 B). At 25 °C, the near UVCD spectrum of wild type αB-crystallin included four positive ellipticity peaks below 290 nm and a large negative peak at approximately 295 nm (Fig.3 A), consistent with past studies using αB-crystallin (34Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 37Sun T.X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.N. J. Biol.

Acta. 1985; 832: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In stark contrast, peaks below 290 nm in the near-UVCD of the R120G mutant were shifted significantly toward negative ellipticity values at 25 °C and only a small negative peak was observed at 295 nm (Fig. 3 A). For wild type αB-crystallin, increasing the temperature from 25 to 45 °C resulted in a large shift in ellipticity from positive to negative values below 290 nm, but had essentially no effect on the ellipticity of the 295 nm peak (Fig. 3 B). For the R120G mutant, an increase from 25 to 45 °C resulted in only a modest shift toward negative ellipticity values below 290 nm, and did not significantly affect the ellipticity at 295 nm (Fig. 3 B). Both the far- and near-UVCD data indicate that the R120G mutation has altered the secondary and tertiary structure of the αB-crystallin. The quaternary structure of R120G αB-crystallin was altered, as assessed by six independent size exclusion chromatography analyses. The protein complexes formed by the R120G αB-crystallin mutant were larger (M r = 823,000 ± 131,000) compared with the wild type (M r = 633,000 ± 80,000) and more disperse, as seen by the broader size distribution given by the standard deviations. Since the structure of αB-crystallin was affected by the R120G mutation, we decided to assess its temperature stability. Protein aggregation was detected by light scattering (Fig.4) and showed that both wild type and R120G αB-crystallin did not aggregate up to 55 °C. Above this temperature, the mutated protein started to aggregate with precipitation 50% complete at 57.2 °C, whereas the wild type αB-crystallin remained soluble up to 63 °C, showing 50% precipitation at 64.5 °C. Furthermore, the aggregation of the R120G αB-crystallin occurred over a wider temperature range than that of the wild type protein (Fig. 4). Thus, the mutation does appear to affect the stability of the protein, but only at higher (>55 °C), non-physiological temperatures. To assess whether the R120G mutation affected the stability of αB-crystallin below 55 °C, the temperature dependence of the ellipticity at 205 and 217 nm was studied by far-UVCD (data not shown). A gradual conformational transition was shown between 25 °C and 55 °C for the wild type, but not the mutated αB-crystallin. This is consistent with the far-UVCD spectra (Fig. 2, A andB, cf. spectra at 25 °C versus45 °C) and indicates that the stability of the mutated protein was not affected below 55 °C. Chymotrypsin has been used to assess the susceptibility of αB-crystallin to proteolysis (22Muchowski P.J. Wu G.J. Liang J.J. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Muchowski P.J. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Clark J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30190-30195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ATP has been shown to increase the protection of some of these sites in the α-crystallin domain against chymotryptic digestion (22Muchowski P.J. Wu G.J. Liang J.J. Adman E.T. Clark J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Muchowski P.J. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Clark J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30190-30195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These assays were used to evaluate the effects of the R120G mutation upon the availability of the chymotryptic sites for digestion as another indicator of changes in the structural characteristics of αB-crystallin (Fig. 5). The R120G mutation did make the chymotryptic sites more accessible compared with the wild type (Fig. 5), as the R120G mutant was digested faster than wild type αB-crystallin. The pattern of proteolytic products produced was qualitatively similar but not the same. Protection of the chymotrypsin sites was afforded upon addition of ATP to both the R120G and wild type αB-crystallin (Fig. 5). Thus, at this level, the differences in the digestion characteristics of R120G αB-crystallin suggested that there had indeed been some structural changes as a result of the mutation, but these did not appear to significantly alter the region(s) of αB-crystallin involved in interactin"

Analysis of Arabidopsis mutants that overaccumulate soluble methionine (Met) revealed that the gene for cystathionine gamma-synthase (CGS), the key enzyme in Met biosynthesis, is regulated at the level of mRNA stability. Transfection experiments with wild-type and mutant forms of the CGS gene suggest that an amino acid sequence encoded by the first exon of CGS acts in cis to destabilize its own mRNA in a process that is activated by Met or one of its metabolites."

These are unicellular, eukaryotic organisms, which, during the course of their complex lifecycle, invade the red blood cells of their vertebrate host. Having entered a red cell, the invading parasite lies dormant for some hours (the ring stage), after which it begins a period of rapid growth (the trophozoite stage) followed by division (schizogony), resulting in the generation of 20–30 new parasites. The metabolic and biosynthetic activity of the malaria trophozoite is intense. The parasite is wholly reliant on glycolysis as its energy source, and it consumes glucose and produces lactic acid at a rate some 100 times higher than does a normal, uninfected erythrocyte (1Vander Jagt D.L. Hunsaker L.A. Campos N.M. Baack B.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Pfaller M.A. Krogstad D.J. Parquette A.R. Nguyen Dinh P. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 54: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The high metabolic activity of the parasite generates a substantial intracellular acid load. In addition, in the in vivosituation, malaria infection commonly gives rise to a pronounced extracellular acidosis (3White N.J. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 371-385Google Scholar). For the parasite to remain viable, it must therefore have an effective means of protecting its intracellular pH (pH i )1from both intra- and extracellular acid loads. Eukaryotic cells extrude H+ via a variety of different mechanisms. Plant cells, yeast, various protozoa, and a number of invertebrate and vertebrate cell types have in their plasma membrane H+-ATPases that utilize energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to pump H+ ions from the cell cytosol (4Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). These are either P-type ATPases (so-called because they form an acyl-phosphate intermediate during their reaction cycle) or V-type ATPases (so-called because they were first described on the membranes of intracellular vacuoles) (4Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In cells of higher eukaryotes, it is more common for the main H+extrusion mechanisms to be “secondary active transporters” that utilize the (inward) transmembrane Na+ gradient to energize the efflux of H+. The most prominent and best understood of these are the Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs; Refs. 5Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar and 6Yun C.H. Tse C.M. Nath S.K. Levine S.A. Brant S.R. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G1-G11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In early studies of the pH i (and transmembrane potential) of the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi, obtained from malaria-infected rats, it was reported that the pH i of the parasite was largely unaffected by variations in the extracellular pH (in the range 6.5–7.2) but was decreased by the H+ pump inhibitorsN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and vanadate (7Mikkelsen R.B. Wallach D.F. Van Doren E. Nillni E.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These findings led to the proposal that the malaria parasite extrudes H+, and thereby regulates its cytosolic pH, via a P-type H+-ATPase, of the sort that operates in the plasma membrane of yeast and plant cells (7Mikkelsen R.B. Wallach D.F. Van Doren E. Nillni E.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Mikkelsen R.B. Tanabe K. Wallach D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). More recently, however, Bosia et al. (9Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that, inPlasmodium falciparum, the most virulent of the four plasmodial strains that are infectious to humans, the maintenance of the parasite's cytosolic pH and the ability of the parasite to recover from an intracellular acidification are both dependent on the presence of Na+ in the extracellular medium. Furthermore, both processes were shown to be inhibited by amiloride and ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), inhibitors of the NHEs of higher eukaryotes. On the basis of these data, it was proposed that the parasite extrudes H+ by means of an NHE, linked to the operation of a Na+ pump, and it was argued that in P. falciparum it is unlikely that a H+ pump makes a significant contribution to the net efflux of H+ (9Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the intracellular pH of P. falciparum to the NHE inhibitor EIPA has been confirmed in single-cell studies with parasites within intact erythrocytes (10Wunsch S. Sanchez C.P. Gekle M. Grosse Wortmann L. Wiesner J. Lanzer M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and Bray et al.(11Bray P.G. Janneh O. Raynes K.J. Mungthin M. Ginsburg H. Ward S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have also reported that in isolated P. falciparumparasites the recovery of the cytosolic pH from an imposed acidification is Na+-dependent. Following on from the original proposal of an NHE at the parasite surface it has, within the last 2 years, been proposed that: (i) the parasite NHE mediates the uptake of the antimalarial agent chloroquine across the parasite plasma membrane (12Sanchez C.P. Wunsch S. Lanzer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2652-2658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); (ii) alterations in the NHE play a central role in the phenomenon of chloroquine resistance (10Wunsch S. Sanchez C.P. Gekle M. Grosse Wortmann L. Wiesner J. Lanzer M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); and (iii) the parasite NHE is encoded by cg2 (13Sanchez C.P. Horrocks P. Lanzer M. Cell. 1998; 92: 601-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a gene identified earlier as being involved in chloroquine resistance (14Su X. Kirkman L.A. Fujioka H. Wellems T.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). All three proposals have been disputed (11Bray P.G. Janneh O. Raynes K.J. Mungthin M. Ginsburg H. Ward S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15Bray P.G. Mungthin M. Ridley R.G. Ward S.A. Mol.

Cell. 1998; 94: 285-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the basic premise that the parasite has an NHE in its plasma membrane has not been challenged. It is unclear whether the reported differences between the rodent parasite, P. chabaudi (postulated to extrude H+via a H+ pump; Ref. 7Mikkelsen R.B. Wallach D.F. Van Doren E. Nillni E.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the human parasite, P. falciparum (postulated to extrude H+ via an NHE acting in concert with a Na+ pump; Ref. 9Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), reflect genuine differences between the two parasite species or whether they reflect the somewhat different methodologies used in the different studies. The aim of the present work was to investigate in detail the H+extrusion mechanism(s) of P. falciparum. The data are inconsistent with a role for an NHE in mediating the efflux of H+ from the intracellular parasite but instead provide compelling evidence for the involvement of a V-type H+-ATPase in both the maintenance of resting pH i and the recovery from an intracellular acidification. The free-acid and acetoxymethyl ester (AM) forms of the fluorescent pH indicator 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) were obtained from Sigma and Molecular Probes, respectively. [14C]5,5-Dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione ([14C]DMO), used for the estimation of pH i, was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All inhibitors were purchased from Sigma with the exception of EMD 96785 (17Fischer H. Seelig A. Beier N. Raddatz P. Seelig J. J. Membr.

All the experiments in this study were carried out using trophozoite-stage parasites (36–40 h after invasion) “isolated” from their host erythrocytes by treatment of parasitized cell suspensions with saponin, a plant-derived detergent that renders cholesterol-containing membranes freely permeable to macromolecules. Treatment of parasitized erythrocytes with saponin permeabilizes both the plasma membrane of the host erythrocyte and the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, in which the intracellular parasite is enclosed (25Ansorge I. Benting J. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,26Ansorge I. Paprotka K. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in the presence of saponin (0.05% w/v) for ≤30 s at room temperature, then washed by centrifugation, and resuspended in culture medium without Albumax II (adjusted to pH 7.1 to match the estimated pH of the cytosol of the trophozoite-infected human erythrocyte; Ref. 10Wunsch S. Sanchez C.P. Gekle M. Grosse Wortmann L. Wiesner J. Lanzer M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The isolated parasites were stored in this media for up to 3 h before experimentation. In a study such as this, there are obvious concerns about the viability (and, in particular, the membrane integrity) of the saponin-freed parasites, and the system has therefore been characterized in some detail. More than 95% of the parasites isolated in this way retained the ability to exclude trypan blue (27Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).

The isolated parasites accumulated the K+ congener86Rb+ to concentrations ∼20-fold higher than the extracellular medium, as well as accumulating the lipophilic membrane potential probe [3H]tetraphenylphosphonium to concentrations ∼100-fold higher than those in the extracellular solution. 3R. J. W. Allen, K. J. Saliba, and K. Kirk, manuscript in preparation. These data are consistent with the parasite plasma membrane remaining intact and able to generate and maintain both transmembrane ion gradients and a substantial, inward negative, membrane potential. The results obtained in the present study provide further evidence for the membrane integrity of the isolated parasites. The pH i of the isolated parasites was measured using the pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator BCECF. The indicator was loaded into saponin permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes as the acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM). The neutral ester readily enters the parasite cytosol, where the ester groups are removed by esterases, rendering the molecule charged and impermeant (28Wunsch S. Sanchez C. Gekle M. Kersting U. Fischer K. Horrocks P. Lanzer M. Behring. Inst. Mitt. 1997; 99: 44-50Google Scholar). Loading was achieved by incubating isolated parasites suspended at a cell density of 0.9–2.1 × 108 cells/ml in culture medium without Albumax II, pH adjusted to 7.1, and containing 1 μm BCECF-AM, for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed (five times) by centrifugation (20 s at 14,000 × g) and resuspension in the culture medium (without Albumax II), then maintained in this medium, at a cell density of 3.7–7.1 × 106 cells/ml and at 37 °C, for no more than 3 h before use. Immediately before beginning pH i recording, an aliquot of cells was centrifuged and resuspended in 1.5 ml of the appropriate solution (see Table I) at a final cell density of 5.6–10.7 × 106 cells/ml. The suspension was transferred to a cuvette, which was placed in the temperature-controlled chamber of a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorometer, maintained at 37 °C. Using a dual excitation “Fast Filter” accessory, the sample was excited at 440 nm and 495 nm successively and the fluorescence measured at 520 nm. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity measured using the two excitation wavelengths (495 nm/440 nm) provides a quantitative measure of pH i. The spectrofluorometer was linked to a computer, allowing the real time monitoring of pH i. Data were imported into graphics software for analysis. Inspection of the BCECF-loaded parasites by fluorescence microscopy revealed that the indicator was confined to, and uniformly distributed in, the parasite cytosol, while remaining excluded from the intracellular food vacuole. Calibration of pH i was achieved using nigericin, as has been described previously for malaria parasites (11Bray P.G. Janneh O. Raynes K.J. Mungthin M. Ginsburg H. Ward S.A. J.

At the conclusion of each experiment, cells were suspended in a high-K+ saline (solution G; TableI) at a pH of 6.8, 7.1, or 7.8, to which was added nigericin (30 μm), an ionophore that catalyzes the exchange of K+ for H+. The addition of nigericin to cells suspended in a medium containing K+ at a similar concentration to that in the cell cytosol causes pH i to equilibrate rapidly with the pH of the suspending medium. Linear regression of the 3-point calibration curve (pH versus the fluorescence intensity ratio) consistently yielded regression coefficients >0.99. In one series of experiments, BCECF was used to monitor the extracellular pH (pH o ) in a weakly buffered suspension of isolated parasites, using a method similar to that described by Benchimol et al. (29Benchimol M. De Souza W. Vanderheyden N. Zhong L. Lu H.G. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Isolated parasites were suspended in solution F to which was added the membrane-impermeant, free-acid form of the indicator (0.38 μm). The final cell density was 1.1–1.8 × 107/ml. Changes in the fluorescence intensity ratio (495 nm/440 nm) provided an estimate of pH o . In experiments designed to investigate the ability of the parasite to respond to an intracellular acidification, pH i was reduced using the NH4+ prepulse technique (10Wunsch S. Sanchez C.P. Gekle M. Grosse Wortmann L. Wiesner J. Lanzer M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,11Bray P.G. Janneh O. Raynes K.J. Mungthin M. Ginsburg H. Ward S.A. J.

Cells suspended in solution A were exposed briefly (<2 min) to 40 mm NH4Cl, after which they were centrifuged (90 s, 14,000 × g), resuspended in the appropriate NH4+-free solution, and then returned to the spectrofluorometer cuvette. This procedure consistently resulted in a decrease in pH i of 0.4–0.5 pH units from the resting pH i . In order to exclude the possibility of artifacts associated with the estimation of pH i using the fluorescent indicator BCECF, estimates of the resting pH i of isolated parasites were also made from the measured distribution of the weak acid [14C]DMO (7Mikkelsen R.B. Wallach D.F. Van Doren E. Nillni E.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Saponin-permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes were incubated with 0.25 μCi/ml [14C]DMO (specific activity 54 mCi/mmol) for 15 min at 37 °C at a cell density of 0.6–2.2 × 108/ml in the appropriate solution. Three 200-μl aliquots of the suspension were then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes containing 250 μl of oil (a 5:4 mixture of dibutyl phthalate:dioctyl phthalate). The tubes were centrifuged, thereby sedimenting the cells below the oil, and the cell pellets were processed for scintillation counting as described previously (27Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The intracellular water volume was estimated using [3H2O] (27Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), thereby allowing the calculation of the intracellular concentration of [14C]DMO ([DMO] i ) and hence the transmembrane [14C]DMO distribution ratio, [DMO] i /[DMO] o, where [DMO] o is the extracellular DMO concentration. The pH i was calculated using the formula: pH i = log10(([DMO] i /[DMO] o ) × (10pK a + 10pHo ) − 10pK a ) where pH o is the extracellular pH, and pK a (for DMO) is 6.3. The concentration of ATP within the parasite was measured using firefly luciferase (31Brown A.M. Ellory J.C. Young J.D. Red Cell Membranes: A Methodological Approach. Academic Press, London1982: 223-238Google Scholar). Aliquots (200 μl) of suspensions of isolated parasites were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes containing 50 μl of perchloric acid (30% w/v) layered beneath 250 μl of the oil mixture described above. The tubes were centrifuged (2 min, 14,000 × g), to sediment the cells through the oil into the acid, thereby terminating ATP synthesis/utilization. The samples were then placed on ice until further processing. The aqueous supernatant solution was removed by aspiration and any solution remaining on the sides of the tubes removed by rinsing the tube four times with water. The oil was aspirated and the perchloric acid neutralized with 0.5 ml of 0.5m NaOH, followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 14,000 × g. A 15-μl aliquot of the supernatant solution was then transferred to a scintillation vial containing 3.6 ml of buffered solution (20 mm HEPES, 25 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). A 20-μl aliquot of firefly luciferase (diluted in water) was placed in the cap of the vial. The tube was sealed with the cap and the reaction started by inverting the tube 10 s before placing the vial in the scintillation counter and measuring the photon emission. A calibration curve was obtained using ATP concentrations in the range 1.3–21 nm in the scintillation vial. As illustrated in Fig.1 A, isolated parasites suspended in normal physiological saline (solution A; pH 7.1) maintained a steady resting pH i. The pH i estimated using BCECF under these conditions ranged between 7.22 and 7.40, with a mean value of 7.29 ± 0.01 (n = 15; ± S.E.; TableII). This value is very similar to that of 7.33 ± 0.06 (n = 10; ± S.E.) calculated from the measured distribution of the weak acid [14C]DMO (Table II).Table IIpH i of isolated parasites suspended in media of different compositionsSuspending solutionDescriptionpH iBCECFp[14C]DMOpASaline (control)7.29 ± 0.01 (15)7.33 ± 0.06 (10)BNa+-free (choline)7.31 ± 0.04 (5)0.267.31 ± 0.08 (6)0.43CNa+-free (NMDG)7.36 ± 0.03 (7)0.077.41 ± 0.09 (6)0.05DGlucose-free7.06 ± 0.01 (6)0.00016.94 ± 0.05 (4)0.013pH i was estimated using the fluorescent pH indicator BCECF, or from the equilibrium distribution of [14C]DMO in cells suspended in the different media for ≥15 min.

The pH i values are those averaged from the number of experiments shown in parentheses, with each experiment carried out on a different day.

Open table in a new tab pH i was estimated using the fluorescent pH indicator BCECF, or from the equilibrium distribution of [14C]DMO in cells suspended in the different media for ≥15 min. The composition of the different suspending solutions is given in Table I.

The errors are S.E., and the p values are those derived from paired t tests comparing pH i estimates for cells in solutions B–D with those for cells in solution A. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (A–C), suspension of the parasites in a solution in which Na+ was replaced with choline (solution B) had no significant effect on pH i (estimated using BCECF), whereas replacement of Na+ with NMDG in the extracellular solution (solution C) actually caused a slight increase in the resting pH i. Very similar results were obtained using the [14C]DMO distribution method for the estimation of pH i (TableII). Parasites subjected to an intracellular acidification (achieved via the NH4+ prepulse technique; see “Experimental Procedures”) recovered their resting pH i within 5–10 min (Fig. 1, D–F). Their ability to do so was unaffected by the replacement of Na+ with either choline or NMDG in the extracellular medium. This situation contrasted with that in rat hepatoma (HTC) cells, which are known to have a functional NHE (32Garcia-Canero R. Dediego J.P. Trilla C. Cobo J.M. Diazgil J.J. Hep. Res. 1998; 10: 27-40Crossref Google Scholar) and which were shown to recover from an NH4+-induced acid load when bathed in solution A but not in solution B or C (data not shown). In isolated parasites, both the maintenance of the resting pH i and the extrusion of H+ from the cytosol following an intracellular acid load therefore occur via mechanisms that are independent of the presence of Na+ in the extracellular medium. The malaria parasite is wholly reliant on glycolysis for the generation of ATP (33Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 135-143Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, on suspension of isolated parasites in glucose-free medium (solution D), there was a rapid decline of the intracellular ATP concentration and a progressive decrease in pH i. On restoration of the glucose to the medium, the intracellular ATP concentration and pH i both recovered back to their original starting values. The dependence of the maintenance of the resting pH i on an adequate supply of glucose, and hence ATP, was confirmed using the [14C]DMO distribution method (Table II). Very similar behavior was seen for cells suspended in glucose-free medium, containing choline in place of Na+ (solution E), with the cells undergoing an initial acidification followed by a full recovery of pH i upon the addition of glucose (data not shown). This rules out the involvement of the transmembrane Na+ gradient in the extrusion of H+ from the parasite cytosol. Fig. 2 B shows the effect of glucose-deprivation on the ability of the parasites to recover from an imposed intracellular acidification. The ability of glucose-deprived parasites to recover their pH i following an acid load was significantly impaired, consistent with H+ extrusion under these conditions being via an ATP-dependent mechanism. Fig.3 shows the effects of a range of transport inhibitors on the resting pH i of isolated parasites, monitored using BCECF. As has been shown previously (9Bosia A. Ghigo D"
https://openalex.org/W2045692715,A sharp discontinuity at the base of Earth's mantle has been suggested from seismic waveform studies; the observed travel time and amplitude variations have been interpreted as changes in the depth of a spatially intermittent discontinuity. Most of the observed variations in travel times and the spatial intermittance of the seismic triplication can be reproduced by a ubiquitous first-order discontinuity superimposed on global seismic velocity structure derived from tomography. The observations can be modeled by a solid-solid phase transition that has a 200-kilometer elevation above the core-mantle boundary under adiabatic temperatures and a Clapeyron slope of about 6 megapascal per kelvin.

The protein kinase p90 Rsk is a substrate of p42 MAPK; thus, the role of p90 Rsk in p42 MAPK-induced mitotic arrest was examined. Xenopus laevis egg extracts immunodepleted of Rsk lost their capacity to undergo mitotic arrest in response to activation of the Mos-MEK-1-p42 MAPK cascade of protein kinases. Replenishing Rsk-depleted extracts with catalytically competent Rsk protein restored the ability of the extracts to undergo mitotic arrest. Rsk appears to be essential for cytostatic factor arrest."
https://openalex.org/W4250017257,"During development of the vertebrate vascular system essential signals are transduced via protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. Null-mutations of receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) display early lethal vascular phenotypes. We aimed to identify endothelial protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which should have similar importance in EC-biology. A murine receptor-type PTP was identified by a degenerated PCR cloning approach from endothelial cells (VE-PTP). By in situ hybridization this phosphatase was found to be specifically expressed in vascular ECs throughout mouse development. In experiments using GST-fusion proteins, as well as in transient transfections, trapping mutants of VE-PTP co-precipitated with the Angiopoietin receptor Tie-2, but not with the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2/Flk-1). In addition, VE-PTP dephosphorylates Tie-2 but not VEGFR-2. We conclude that VE-PTP is a Tie-2 specific phosphatase expressed in ECs, and VE-PTP phosphatase activity serves to specifically modulate Angiopoietin/Tie-2 function. Based on its potential role as a regulator of blood vessel morphogenesis and maintainance, VE-PTP is a candidate gene for inherited vascular malformations similar to the Tie-2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2054826455,"Transcriptional repression by sequence-specific DNA binding factors is mediated by the recruitment of a corepressor complex to the promoter region. The NK-3 homeodomain protein is a transcriptional repressor that recruits the nuclear protein kinase, homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2).

Moreover, HIPK2 appears to regulate the corepressor activity of Groucho.

Among corepressors, it has been well established that Groucho proteins can serve as corepressors for several distinct types of active repressors such as the Hairy-related and Runt domain proteins (12Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 13Jimenez G. Paroush Z. Ish-Horowicz D.

However, it has not been demonstrated whether Groucho, like other corepressors, can interact with the histone deacetylase complex (12Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the NK-3 homeodomain protein (15Kim Y. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7716-7720Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), which belongs to the NK-2 class that includes a large number of vertebrate homeodomain transcription factors (16Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), is a transcriptional repressor and that the nuclear protein kinase HIPK21 can act as a corepressor for NK-3 (17Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S.J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). During the course of investigating the function of HIPK2, we noticed that HIPK2 could interact with Groucho. Because it was unknown whether Groucho is involved in the NK-3-mediated transcriptional repression, it was of interest to examine whether Groucho can act as a corepressor for NK-3. Here we show that the NK-3 homeodomain transcription factor recruits the Groucho corepressor, HIPK2, and a histone deacetylase complex to repress transcription. Cell transfections (5 × 105 cells per transfection) and CAT assays were performed as described previously (18Lee Y.M. Park T.Y. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17531-17541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The NK3CAT reporter was constructed by inserting a XhoI-DNA fragment (1.6 kilobase), which includes both the 5′ upstream region containing NK-3 autorepression sites (NK3AR), and the promoter region of NK-3 into theSalI site of the pCAT-basic vector (Promega). For the constructions of the FLAG-, GFP-, and Myc-tagged expression vectors, each cDNA was cloned into the CMV-Tag1 (Stratagene), pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH), and pCS3+MT vectors, respectively. For generating the mutant expression vector, PCR-based mutagenesis was employed. HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, and nuclear extracts (1 mg of nuclear proteins) were immunoprecipitated with either anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or an anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH), followed by Western blot with either an anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) or anti-mSin3A (K20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described (9Laherty C.D.

Various NK-3 and Groucho cDNAs were subcloned into the pSPUTK vector and subjected toin vitro translation using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Pull-down assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of GST or the indicated GST-NK3, GST-GRO, GST-HIPK2, and GST-HDAC1 fusion proteins immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads with various in vitro translated, 35S-labeled truncated forms of Groucho and NK-3 proteins as described (17Kim Y.H.

Expression and purification of the fusion proteins were performed as described previously (18Lee Y.M. Park T.Y. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol.

CHIP assays were performed using a CHIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) as described (5Kadosh D. Struhl K. Mol. Cell.

Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 477-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106) were transfected with indicated plasmids (5 μg of reporter plasmids and 10 μg of expression vector) and fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min before harvesting. The cross-linked chromatins were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to the acetylated histones H3 and H4. Total DNA (50 μl) recovered from the immunoprecipitates was subjected to quantitative PCR (25 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, 45 s at 72 °C) using specific primers (P1, 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAACTCG-3′; P2, 5′-GAATGTGTGTCAGTTAGGGTGTGG-3′) and 2 μl of template DNA. The band intensities of the PCR products were measured with the Stratagene Eagle Eye II image analysis program. Three hundred μl of nuclear extract (10 mg/ml) was run on a Superose 6-gel filtration column (10 × 300 mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer B containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After sample injection, fractions of 300 μl were collected (flow rate, 0.3 ml/min). An aliquot (15 μl) of every other fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis. The following proteins were used for calibration: thyroglobulin (670 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), aldorase (160 kDa), and albumin (68 kDa). We show that Groucho acts as a corepressor for NK-3 (Fig.1). Repressor activity of NK-3 on the native NK-3 promoter (NK3CAT), which contains autorepression sites, was enhanced by Groucho (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and5). This effect was not seen using NK3NQ, which has a mutation within the homeodomain and cannot bind to target sequences (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 6). Groucho also enhanced the repressor activity of GAL4-NK3, in which NK-3 was tethered to a heterologous GAL4 DNA binding domain, on a synthetic promoter (G5EnXCAT) (Fig. 1 A, lanes 9-11). In contrast, GAL4-NK3ΔHD, which does not show any repressor activity alone (lane 12) and cannot interact with Groucho (see below) because of deletion of the homeodomain, did not respond to Groucho (Fig. 1 A, lanes 13-15). Thus, these results indicate that NK-3-mediated transcriptional repression, either on the native promoter or on a synthetic promoter, is greatly augmented by Groucho and suggest that the Groucho-enhanced repressor activity of NK-3 occurs through protein-protein interaction. To test whether NK-3 can recruit Groucho in vivo, nuclear extracts from cells transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-tagged NK-3 (FLAG-NK3) and Myc-tagged Groucho (Myc-GRO) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody and were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1 B). Indeed, Groucho was immunoprecipitated only from cells cotransfected with NK-3 and Groucho (Fig. 1 B, lane 6), suggesting that Groucho is associated with NK-3 in vivo. In addition, the GFP-GRO(WD) fusion construct containing the WD domain (aa 399–719), which itself lacks a nuclear localization signal and thus is localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 C, left panel), was translocated into the nucleus when cotransfected with NK-3 (Fig. 1 C, right panel). This result indicates that GFP-GRO(WD) can associate with NK-3 in vivo in the absence of DNA and that this interaction helps its translocation into the nucleus. Using a GST-Groucho protein and various in vitro translated NK-3 proteins, pull-down assays were performed to test direct interaction between the two proteins. The full-length NK-3 can strongly bind to Groucho (Fig.1 D, lane 3). Deletion of either the C terminus (aa 302–382) or the N-terminal half (aa 1–162) of NK-3 does not affect its binding activity to Groucho (Fig. 1 D, lanes 6 and 15). However, further deletion of the homeodomain from these constructs abolished (Fig. 1 D, lane 9) or weakened (Fig. 1 D, lane 18) the binding activity to Groucho, demonstrating that the homeodomain of NK-3 is important for strong interaction with Groucho. Converse experiments using in vitro translated Groucho proteins confirmed direct binding of Groucho to GST-NK-3 (Fig. 1 E, lane 3). For the interaction of Groucho with NK-3, both the WD 40-repeat domain located in the C terminus, which was shown to function as a protein-protein interaction domain (21Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), and the N terminus of Groucho, which is involved in tetramerization of Groucho (22Chen G.Q. Nguyen P.H. Courey A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7259-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), are required (Fig. 1 E, lanes 9 and 15). Taken together, these results indicate that NK-3 directly interacts with Groucho, strongly suggesting that Groucho acts as a corepressor for the NK-3 homeodomain transcription factor. Because corepressors, which are recruited to target promoters, associate with the mSin3-histone deacetylase complex (6Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J.

Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), we then asked whether histone deacetylase activities are involved in NK-3 and Groucho-mediated repression. Transfected cells were treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (19Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), and repressor activities of NK-3 and Groucho were compared with those from untreated cells. TSA treatment alleviated repressor activities of NK-3 on the NK-3 promoter (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1-7). Also, TSA treatment was effective in relieving the repressor activities of GAL4-NK3 and GAL4-GRO (Fig.2 A, lanes 8-14). These results suggest that the histone deacetylase activities are associated with the repressor activities of NK-3 and the Groucho corepressor. Indeed, immunoprecipitation experiments showed that both NK-3 and Groucho associate with the histone deacetylase HDAC1 in vivo (Fig.2 B, lanes 8 and 16). Groucho directly interacts with HDAC1 in vitro (Fig. 2 C,lane 3). Interestingly, the N-terminal region of Groucho is important for strong binding to HDAC1 (Fig. 2 C, lane 9), which coincides with the fact that the N-terminal region can act as an active repression domain when tethered to DNA-binding proteins (22Chen G.Q. Nguyen P.H. Courey A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7259-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We found that NK-3 also binds directly to HDAC1 (Fig. 2 D) and that the interaction domains with HDAC1 are similar to those of the Groucho-binding domains. Furthermore, the immunoprecipitated proteins showed histone deacetylase activityin vitro, which was inhibited by the presence of TSA (Fig.3 A). Consistent with the well established results seen in the mSin3-histone deacetylase complex (6Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D.

Taken together, these results indicate that NK-3 recruits a corepressor complex containing Groucho, mSin3A, and histone deacetylase to repress transcription.Figure 3CHIP assays showing a decrease in acetylated histones H3 and H4 associated with the G5EnXCAT promoter by recruitment of the histone deacytalyse complex in vivo.

Hence, the deacetylase complex recruited by NK-3 and Groucho may modify chromatin. To test this idea, CHIP assays were employed (Fig.3 C) (20Crane-Robinson C. Wolffe A.P. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 477-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two different reporters were cotransfected into cells with either GAL4-NK3 or GAL4. G5EnXCAT contains an SV40 enhancer and GAL4 binding sites, and responds to GAL4 proteins. The EnXCAT, lacking GAL4 binding sites, does not respond to GAL4 protein but forms active chromatin; hence this reporter was used as an internal control for the CHIP assays. The precipitated DNAs, following immunoprecipitation of chromatin, were subjected to a quantitative PCR with primers (Fig. 3 C, P1 and P2), and the intensities of the amplified bands (G5, 404 bp from G5EnXCAT; G0, 281 bp from EnXCAT) were measured. We found that the ratio (G5/G0) of band intensity amplified from the chromatins of cells transfected with GAL4-NK3, is remarkably reduced (Fig. 3 C, lanes 4, 5, and 7) when compared with that of cells transfected with GAL4 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2,3, and 6). These results indicate that recruitment of the histone deacetylase complex to the target promoter region by GAL4-NK3 decreased the acetylated histones H3 and H4, suggesting that this modification of histones may generate a domain of repressed chromatin in vivo. We have previously shown that HIPK2 can act as a corepressor for NK-3 (17Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S.J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Hence, we wondered whether HIPK2 was a component of the corepressor complex described above. To test this idea, nuclear extracts from transfected cells were subjected to Superose 6-gel filtration column, and fractions were analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4 A, HIPK2, Groucho, and NK-3 were detected in fractions larger than their monomer sizes (peak fractions 46, 42, and 52, respectively). In addition, all three proteins were also eluted ahead of a 670-kDa marker, molecular mass 1000-2000 kDa, suggesting that the three proteins are associated with other nuclear proteins. Endogenous mSin3A, HDAC1, and RbAp48 showed a broad elution profile (Fig. 4 A), indicating that they participate in different complexes. Groucho and HIPK2 are coimmunoprecipitated with NK-3 (Fig. 4 B). Also, mSin3A and HDAC1 were detected in the same immunoprecipitate, which is consistent with our results described above (Figs. 2 and 3) and suggests that they associate with each other to form a corepressor complex. A separate series of experiments with nuclear extracts prepared from cells cotransfected with HIPK2 together with either NK-3 (Fig. 4 C) or Groucho (Fig. 4 D) revealed that HIPK2 associates with NK-3 and Groucho in vivo. Two HIPK2 bands were detected (Fig. 4 C and D, lanes 2 and 3), one of which is presumably the modified form of HIPK2. Interestingly, both NK-3 and Groucho recruit the faster migrating HIPK2 band (Fig. 4,C and D, lane 6, arrows). In addition, HIPK2 binds directly to Groucho and NK-3 in vitro (Fig. 4 E). Taken together, these results indicate that HIPK2 directly interacts with NK-3 and Groucho and suggest that HIPK2 is a component of the corepressor complex recruited by NK-3. Finally, we investigated the effect of HIPK2 on the corepressor activity of Groucho using cotransfection assays with either wild type HIPK2 or kinase-inactive HIPK2KR (Fig. 4 F). We used GAL4-NK3 (lanes 2-7) and G5EnXCAT as reporters, and GAL4-NK3ΔHD was used as a control (lanes 8-13). We found that, in the absence of Groucho, the wild type HIPK2 enhanced the repressor activity of GAL4-NK3 (Fig. 4 F, lane 3). In the presence of Groucho, however, wild type HIPK2 did not enhance the corepressor activity of Groucho further (Fig.4 F, lane 6). Instead, wild type HIPK2 seemed to relieve the corepressor activity of Groucho (Fig. 4 F,lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, the kinase inactive mutant HIPK2 (HIPK2KR) can enhance the corepressor activity of Groucho (Fig. 4 F, lane 7). These results indicate that the corepressor activity of Groucho is regulated by HIPK2 and suggest that the kinase activity of HIPK2 is involved in this regulation. In summary, our results indicate that the NK-3 homeodomain protein recruits a corepressor complex containing Groucho, HIPK2, and a histone deacetylase complex to repress transcription. In light of our results, we propose that a global mechanism of repression, deacetylation of histones, is involved in transcriptional repression by the homeodomain transcription factor. We have recently demonstrated that HIPK2 is covalently modified by the ubiquitin-like protein, SUMO-1, and that SUMO-1-modification of HIPK2 correlates with its localization to nuclear dots (24Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). In this regard, it is of interest to speculate that HIPK2 may play a regulatory role in the formation of a corepressor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1975072760,"Before fertilization, vertebrate eggs are arrested in metaphase of meiosis II by cytostatic factor (CSF), an activity that requires activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. To investigate whether CSF arrest is mediated by the protein kinase p90Rsk, which is phosphorylated and activated by MAPK, a constitutively activated (CA) form of Rsk was expressed in Xenopus embryos. Expression of CA Rsk resulted in cleavage arrest, and cytological analysis showed that arrested blastomeres were in M phase with prominent spindles characteristic of meiotic metaphase. Thus, Rsk appears to be the mediator of MAPK-dependent CSF arrest in vertebrate unfertilized eggs."
https://openalex.org/W2045492296,"The heregulins are a family of ligands with ability to induce phosphorylation of the p185HER-2/neu receptor. Various investigators have reported a variety of responses of mouse and human breast and ovarian cells to this family of ligands including growth stimulation, growth inhibition, apoptosis and induction of differentiation in cells expressing the HER-2/neu receptor. Some of the disparity in the literature has been attributed to variations in the cell lines studied, ligand dose applied, methodologies utilized or model system evaluated (i.e. in vitro or in vivo). To evaluate the effects of heregulin on normal and malignant human breast and ovarian epithelial cells expressing known levels of the HER-2/neu receptor, this report presents the use of several different assays, performed both in vitro and in vivo, in vitro proliferation assays, direct cell counts, clonogenicity under anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent conditions, as well as the in vivo effects of heregulin on human cells growing in nude mice to address heregulin activity. Using a total of five different biologic assays in nine different cell lines, across two different epithelia and over a one log heregulin dose range, we obtained results that clearly indicate a growth-stimulatory role for this ligand in human breast and ovarian epithelial cells. We find no evidence that heregulin has any growth-inhibitory effects in human epithelial cells. We also quantitated the amount of each member of the type I receptor tyrosine kinase family (RTK I, i.e. HER-1, HER-2, HER-3 and HER-4) in the cell lines employed and correlated this to their respective heregulin responses. These data demonstrate that HER-2/neu overexpression itself affects the expression of other RTK I members and that cells expressing the highest levels of HER-2/neu have the greatest response to HRG."
https://openalex.org/W2319767540,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein can function as an activator and a repressor of gene transcription. Currently, the mechanism of transcriptional repression by p53 is poorly understood. To aid in clarifying this mechanism, we carried out studies designed to identify specific target genes that are down-regulated following p53 induction. Among the negative p53-response genes revealed by our screening protocols are those encoding stathmin (Op18), a tubulin-associated protein implicated in cell signaling pathways, and an FK506/rapamycin-binding protein, FKBP25. Stathmin and FKBP25 exhibit decreased expression in both human and murine immortalized and transformed cell lines following induction of wild-type p53 by several stimuli that result in DNA damage. Candidate p53-repressed genes such as these provide the necessary markers to delineate the mechanism and biological consequences of transcriptional repression mediated by p53."
https://openalex.org/W2044304784,"HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein interacts with various cellular factors and modulates transcription and the cell cycle. To identify more cellular targets, we employed the yeast two hybrid system with Tax using a human cDNA library, and isolated a cDNA encoding the human counterpart of Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein, hDLG. Tax binding to hDLG was confirmed in vitro and also in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Furthermore, hDLG was found to be efficiently phosphorylated in Tax-transfected cells and HTLV-1-infected T-cells. The C-terminus of Tax and the PDZ domain of hDLG were responsible for the binding of Tax to hDLG. The C-terminal peptide of Tax prevented the binding of hDLG to APC tumor suppressor gene product, suggesting inhibition of hDLG function by Tax. Over-expression of hDLG in NIH3T3 cells by microinjection induced a reduction of BrdU incorporation into DNA, but co-expression of Tax suppressed this inhibitory effect of hDLG. These results suggest that hDLG arrested the cell cycle and that Tax canceled this inhibitory action of hDLG through targeting hDLG. Therefore, Tax affects this novel regulatory pathway of the cell cycle alteration, of which seems to play a role in the development of human cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2324191190,"Mutant-type p53 (mt p53) is largely accumulated in cancer cells due to its increased stability. To elucidate the mechanism of mt p53 stabilization, we analysed the turnover of p53 mutated at codon 248 whose alteration is most frequently found in human cancers. Proteasome inhibition induced the accumulation of ubiquitinated mt p53, indicating that the ubiquitinated forms were essentially unstable and degraded by the proteasome. The presence of a small amount of the ubiquitinated mt p53 relative to the abundant non-ubiquitinated form suggested that the mt p53 ubiquitination was a rate-limiting process in the slow turnover. Two phenomena destabilizing mt p53 via the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation were proved to be independent. First, the coexpression of wild-type p53 (wt p53) promoted mt p53 destabilization as feedback regulation. Second, geldanamycin also induced mt p53 destabilization through the dissociation of the protein from hsp90 but not through the restoration of wt p53 function. Neither the mutant-specific conformation nor the N-terminal phosphorylation seemed to contribute directly to the mt p53 stabilization. Further, a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that most of the post-translationally modified mt p53 was equally subjected to ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. These findings are evidence that mt p53 stabilization depends on the impaired ubiquitination due to both the loss of wt p53 function and the hsp90 association."

In contrast to Ras- and Rho-specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that have been studied in great detail, little is known about the functioning of GAPs specific for Ypt/Rab transport GTPases. We have identified two novel Ypt/Rab-GAPs because of their sequence relatedness to the three known GAPs Gyp1p, Gyp6p, and Gyp7p.

Although the affinity of Msb3/Gyp3p for its preferred substrate Sec4p is low (K m = 154 μm), it accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Sec4p 5 × 105-fold.

GTPase-activating protein open reading frame polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis In eukaryotic cells, monomeric GTPases of the Ras superfamily serve as regulators of a wide variety of vital activities, among them the vesicular protein and membrane transport. In the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the full complement of Ypt/Rab-GTPases is known, and a critical functional role of most of the eleven members of the family could be assigned to specific steps of the exocytic and endocytic transport routes (1Lazar T. Götte M. Gallwitz D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 468-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Ypt/Rab proteins share with other GTPases of the Ras superfamily a high affinity for guanine nucleotides and a rather slow intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate. As the GTP-bound conformation of these proteins is the active one, the switch to the inactive conformation requires an acceleration of their inbuilt slow GTPase activity. This is achieved by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 first discovered for Ras proteins (2Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). A large number of GAPs with specificity for Ras and Rho proteins has been identified from divergent species and analyzed in great detail (for review, see Refs. 3Boguski M.S. McCormick F.

With the same experimental strategy, two structurally related GAPs, Gyp1p and Gyp7p, were cloned and shown to significantly accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of several Ypt proteins (7Vollmer P.

From mammalian cells, the structure of only two Ypt/Rab-GAPs has been described. One of them, GAPCenA, prefers Rab6 as substrate and shares sequence similarity with the yeast Gyp proteins (11Cuif M. Possmayer F. Zander H.N.B. Jollivet F. Couedel-Courteille A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Langsley G. Bornens M. Goud B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1772-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The other, Rab3-GAP (12Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol.

A recent study in which we identified the catalytically active domains of Gyp1p and Gyp7p, and within them a conserved arginine required for catalytic activity (10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), suggests that Ypt/Rab-GAPs, despite their sequence disparity from Ras- and Rho-GAPs, might act by the same basic mechanism. In a data base search using a multiple alignment program, Gyp6p and Gyp7p were reported to have sequence segments related to a number of proteins from different species, among them several yeast proteins with unknown function (15Neuwald A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 243-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the related sequences are confined to what we have identified as the catalytic domain of Gyp1p and Gyp7p, and they invariably contain the conserved arginine residue that we have found to be essential for catalytic activity (10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As the three known yeast Ypt/Rab-GAPs accept several of the Ypt proteins as substrate, but the essential GTPases Ypt1p and Ypt31/32p are not preferred substrate of either of the GAPs, we set out to investigate whether some of the candidate yeast Ypt/Rab-GAPs are indeed GTPase-activating proteins and, if so, which of the transport GTPases would serve as their prime substrate. We here report that Msb3p (product of ORF YNL293w), thought to be involved in Cdc42p signaling pathways (16Bi, E., Chiavetta, J. B., Chen, H., Chen, G.-C., Chan, C. S. M., and Pringle, J. R. Mol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we analyzed the protein products of two open reading frames whose functions are still obscure. In a computer search, the primary sequences deduced from YNL293w (MSB3) and from YGR100w (MDR1) had already been found to contain several segments related to the Ypt/Rab-GAPs Gyp6p and Gyp7p (15Neuwald A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 243-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These sequence fragments are in fact part of the catalytic domain of Gyp1p and Gyp7p (10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A sequence comparison of the catalytically active fragments of the two Ypt/Rab-GAPs and the related sequence segments of Msb3p and Mdr1p is presented in Fig.1.We therefore decided to investigate if Msb3p and/or Mdr1p have GAP activity for members of the Ypt/Rab family of transport GTPases. Because of our previously experienced difficulties in producing reasonable quantities of full-length yeast Ypt/Rab-GAPs in E. coli, we attempted to overproduce the 72.99-kDa Msb3p and the 109.23-kDa Mdr1p in yeast from the GAL10 promoter-controlled genes. To ease the purification of the proteins, they were synthesized as C-terminal His6-tagged versions. The modified ORFs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the 2-μm based vector pYES2. After yeast transformation, positive clones containing the recombinant vectors were grown either in glucose- (uninduced) or in galactose-containing media (induced). Using a filter assay, protein extracts (10,000 × g supernatants of broken cells) from galactose-induced cells were first screened for enhanced GAP activity with different [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Ypt GTPases as substrate. It was found that several positive clones induced to synthesize either of the two His6-tagged proteins exhibited a significantly increased apparent GAP activity (loss of GTPase-bound radioactivity) toward some of the GTPases tested.For further analysis, soluble proteins from selected transformants were passed over Ni2+-agarose and, after column washing with loading buffer, affinity matrix-bound proteins were released with 250 mm imidazole. These were then subjected to ion exchange chromatography on MonoQ, and fractions containing the recombinant proteins were concentrated by Centricon 30-filtration. As can be seen from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A), His6-tagged Msb3p and Mdr1p could be purified to about 60–70% by this two-step procedure, the main contaminants being two proteins with an apparent molecular mass of ∼25 kDa.Figure 2Acceleration of GTPase activities of Sec4p and Ypt51p by Mdr1/Gyp2p and Msb3/Gyp3p. A, Mdr1/Gyp2-His6 (lane 2) and Msb3/Gyp3-His6 (lane 3) proteins were purified from overexpressing yeast strains by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA column, followed by MonoQ anion exchange chromatography. To check the purity, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins from non-transformed yeast that bound to Ni-NTA (lane 4) served as control for GAP activity measurements. Molecular mass markers are shown in lane 1. B, Sec4p·GTP (20 μm) was incubated at 30 °C with 200 nmMdr1/Gyp2p (▴) or Msb3/Gyp3p (○), with 2.8 μg of proteins from wild-type yeast bound to and eluted from a Ni-NTA column (●), or with buffer only (■).

Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The partially purified Msb3p and Mdr1p were then used to characterize the proteins with respect to their preferred substrate GTPases. GAP activities were determined under standard conditions in which about 200 nm of either Msb3-His6 or Mdr1-His6protein, calculated from densitometric scanning of SDS gels of partially purified preparations (Fig. 2 A), was incubated at 30 °C with various 20 μm GTP-loaded GTPases. GTP hydrolysis was monitored by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the remaining GTP and the GDP generated with time. The initial GTP hydrolysis rates were compared with the intrinsic rates of the GTPases analyzed (Fig. 2, B and C). As a control, Ni2+-agarose-bound proteins from yeast cells not expressing the His6-tagged proteins were subjected to GAP activity determinations using Sec4p as substrate. As shown in Fig.2 B, GAPs at least for this GTPase were not enriched fortuitously from wild-type yeast by Ni2+-agarose chromatography. As summarized in Table I, the Msb3 protein accelerated the intrinsic GTPase activity of most Ypt proteins tested, the preferred substrates being Sec4p, Ypt6p, Ypt51p, and Ypt31p. The Mdr1 protein was found to be a more specific GAP which significantly accelerated the intrinsic GTPase activity of only Ypt6p and Sec4p. An activation of less than 10-fold determined under the conditions described is not regarded as significant.Table ISubstrate specificity of Mdr1/Gyp2p and Msb3/Gyp3pGTPaseGTP hydrolysis rate1-aGTP hydrolysis rates were determined at 30 °C.AccelerationGTP hydrolysis rate1-aGTP hydrolysis rates were determined at 30 °C.AccelerationIntrinsicMdr1/Gyp2p-acceleratedMsb3/Gyp3p-accelerated min −1-foldmin −1-foldYpt1p0.00251-bValues taken from Albert et al.

Open table in a new tab Remarkably, Sec4p and Ypt51p were recently shown to be the most efficient substrates for the Ypt/Rab-GAP Gyp1p as well (8Du L.L. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3253-3256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In comparing the degree of activation of the Sec4p GTP hydrolysis rate catalyzed under identical conditions by either the Gyp1p catalytic domain (10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or the full-length Msb3 protein described here, we noticed that Msb3p appeared to be a more efficient GAP for Sec4p than Gyp1p. We therefore sought to determine the catalytic properties of Msb3p using the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation (20Duggleby R.G. Clarke R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) which allows theK m and k cat values to be determined from single time curves and which has been previously applied to study Ras/Ras-GAP (19Schweins T. Geyer M. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Warshel A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14225-14231Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Ypt7p/Gyp7p interactions (10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For this study, 100 nm Msb3-His6 protein were incubated with 165 μm GTP-loaded Sec4p and the GTP hydrolysis rates determined at short intervals. The time curve shown in Fig. 2 D was used to calculate the K m (154 μm) and the k cat (13.3 s−1) with the help of the program “Scientist.” The data obtained demonstrate that like Gyp1p and Gyp7p (10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), Msb3p has a relatively low affinity for its preferred substrate GTPase. On the other hand, Msb3p is catalytically very active. Given the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of Sec4p (0.0016 min−1) and thek cat measured (13.3 s−1), the activation by Msb3p is as high as 5 × 105-fold.DISCUSSIONWe have shown here that two yeast proteins of so far unknown function, Mdr1p and Msb3p, are very efficient GTPase-activating proteins for transport GTPases of the Ypt/Rab family. The search for GAP activity of these proteins was prompted by the fact that the originally discovered sequence motifs that Mdr1p and Msb3p share with the known Ypt/Rab-GAPs Gyp1p, Gyp6p, and Gyp7p (15Neuwald A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 243-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) lie within the catalytic domain of the Gyp proteins (10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Like Gyp1p, Gyp6p, and Gyp7p (6Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 8Du L.L. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), Mdr1p and Msb3p are not entirely specific for only one of the eleven yeast Ypt/Rab-GTPases. Although Gyp6p (6Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and Gyp7p (7Vollmer P. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) display a clear substrate preference for Ypt6p and Ypt7p, respectively, Gyp1p (8Du L.L. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3253-3256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and the novel GAP Msb3p, which we suggest to name Gyp3p, are remarkably promiscuous with respect to their substrate GTPases. Msb3/Gyp3p is a potent GAP for Sec4p, accelerating its intrinsic GTPase activity by a factor of 5 × 105. This compares well with the activation rates measured for Gyp7p (10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), for Ras- and Ran-GAPs (21Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 22Ahmadian M.R. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Bischoff F.R. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and it significantly exceeds the activation rate reported for Gyp1p (10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and Rho-GAPs (24Zhang B.L. Zheng Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mdr1p, which we suggest to name Gyp2p, is, like Msb3/Gyp3p, also a potent GAP for Sec4p and Ypt6p. But in contrast to Msb3/Gyp3p, Mdr1/Gyp2p does not activate significantly the intrinsic GTPase activity of any other Ypt protein (Table I). Notably, Msb3/Gyp3p is the only of the known five yeast Ypt/Rab-GAPs which activates the intrinsic GTPase activity of all three essential Ypt-GTPases, Ypt1p, Sec4p and the redundant pair Ypt31p/Ypt32p. This is at least true in vitro. It is unclear at present which sequences of the different GTPases are important for binding to a given Ypt/Rab-GAP. Lack of GAP activity toward a given GTPase might not necessarily mean that a Ypt/Rab-GAP does not bind to that GTPase. It is known, for example, that Ras-GAP binds with even higher affinity to Rap1 than to Ras without accelerating its intrinsic GTPase activity (25Frech M. John J. Pizon V. Chardin P. Tavitian A. Clark R. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1990; 249: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It might well be that within the cell, substrate specificity of Ypt/Rab-GAPs is attained by their recruitment to specific organelles on which specific GTPases reside. In this context it is important to note that although for the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of Gyp1p and of Gyp7p a fragment of about 45 kDa is sufficient, leaving nearly half of the proteins for other purposes, perhaps for the recruitment of the GAPs to specific membranes (10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The same might be true for the newly discovered Ypt/Rab-GAPs having molecular masses of 73 kDa (Msb3/Gyp3p) or 109 kDa (Mdr1/Gyp2p).What is known about Mdr1p and Msb3p that we have now identified to be potent Ypt/Rab-GAPs? According to structure prediction programs, both proteins contain putative transmembrane domains. Mdr1/Gyp2p and Msb3/Gyp3p, however, are perfectly soluble proteins as we have observed in the present study. Mdr1p is thought to interact with Mac1p (16Bi, E., Chiavetta, J. B., Chen, H., Chen, G.-C., Chan, C. S. M., and Pringle, J. R. Mol. Biol. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar), a transcriptional regulator required for copper permease expression and copper uptake (26Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 27Joshi A. Serpe M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 218-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As no detailed studies have been reported on Mdr1p, we will not speculate on a possible functional relationship of the putative transcription factor-binding protein and its proven efficient Ypt/Rab-GAP activity. Msb3p has been isolated as a multicopy suppressor of bud emergence mutants with specific defects in the GTPase Cdc42p and its nucleotide exchange factor Cdc24p (16Bi, E., Chiavetta, J. B., Chen, H., Chen, G.-C., Chan, C. S. M., and Pringle, J. R. Mol. Biol. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar). Interestingly, Msb3p/Gyp3p localizes to the bud tip, the site of polarized secretion (16Bi, E., Chiavetta, J. B., Chen, H., Chen, G.-C., Chan, C. S. M., and Pringle, J. R. Mol. Biol. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar). At the plasma membrane of the bud tip, Sec3p has been recently shown to organize the multi-protein complex required for fusion of secretory vesicles (28Finger F.P. Hughes T.E. Novick P. Cell. 1998; 92: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Sec4p colocalizes with Sec3p and other proteins at the bud tip, and it appears to be an attractive possibility that Msb3/Gyp3p acts as Sec4p-GAP at the site of polarized exocytosis.Msb3p has a homologue, Msb4p, with which it shares more than 50% of identical sequence. Like Msb3/Gyp3p but less efficient, Msb4p at high intracellular concentration acts as suppressor of a specificcdc24 mutant (16Bi, E., Chiavetta, J. B., Chen, H., Chen, G.-C., Chan, C. S. M., and Pringle, J. R. Mol. Biol. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar). In line with this, our preliminary studies show that Msb4p might also be a GTPase-activating protein for Ypt/Rab-GTPases. Details of the functional link between the Cdc42-regulated pathway(s) and the Ypt/Rab-GAPs have still to be resolved. In eukaryotic cells, monomeric GTPases of the Ras superfamily serve as regulators of a wide variety of vital activities, among them the vesicular protein and membrane transport. In the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the full complement of Ypt/Rab-GTPases is known, and a critical functional role of most of the eleven members of the family could be assigned to specific steps of the exocytic and endocytic transport routes (1Lazar T. Götte M. Gallwitz D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 468-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Ypt/Rab proteins share with other GTPases of the Ras superfamily a high affinity for guanine nucleotides and a rather slow intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate. As the GTP-bound conformation of these proteins is the active one, the switch to the inactive conformation requires an acceleration of their inbuilt slow GTPase activity. This is achieved by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 first discovered for Ras proteins (2Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). A large number of GAPs with specificity for Ras and Rho proteins has been identified from divergent species and analyzed in great detail (for review, see Refs. 3Boguski M.S. McCormick F.

Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). With the same experimental strategy, two structurally related GAPs, Gyp1p and Gyp7p, were cloned and shown to significantly accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of several Ypt proteins (7Vollmer P. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Du L.L. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Biol.

From mammalian cells, the structure of only two Ypt/Rab-GAPs has been described. One of them, GAPCenA, prefers Rab6 as substrate and shares sequence similarity with the yeast Gyp proteins (11Cuif M. Possmayer F. Zander H.N.B. Jollivet F. Couedel-Courteille A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Langsley G. Bornens M. Goud B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1772-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The other, Rab3-GAP (12Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), is not related at all to yeast Ypt/Rab-GAPs. Ras- and Rho-GAPs, although not homologous in primary structure, are topologically related and fulfill their catalytic activity in a similar way by inserting a conserved arginine residue (“arginine finger”) into the active site of their substrate GTPases (4Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 5Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

A recent study in which we identified the catalytically active domains of Gyp1p and Gyp7p, and within them a conserved arginine required for catalytic activity (10Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), suggests that Ypt/Rab-GAPs, despite their sequence disparity from Ras- and Rho-GAPs, might act by the same basic mechanism. In a data base search using a multiple alignment program, Gyp6p and Gyp7p were reported to have sequence segments related to a number of proteins from different species, among them several yeast proteins with unknown function (15Neuwald A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 243-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the related sequences are confined to what we have identified as the catalytic domain of Gyp1p and Gyp7p"
https://openalex.org/W2032381707,"The human homologue of fz1 (Hfz1) was cloned from a cDNA library. Hfz1 was shown to couple to Wnt signal transduction pathways by its ability to enhance Wnt induced TCF dependent transcription in both autocrine and paracrine modes. Enhanced TCF dependent signaling was dose dependent with respect to both Wnt-3A and Hfz1. Moreover, Hfz1 deletion mutants with truncated carboxy termini showed markedly reduced capacity to enhance Wnt signal transduction. Specificity was demonstrated with respect to signal transduction by different Wnts. While Wnt-3a, -3, -1 and to a lesser extent Wnt-2 cooperated with Hfz1 in the paracrine assay for TCF dependent signaling, neither Wnt-4, -5a, -5b, -6, -7a nor -7b did so, despite similar levels of expression. However, coimmunoprecipitation of Hfz1 with both Wnt-3a and Wnt-5a indicated that TCF dependent signaling in response to Wnts is not determined solely by their ability to bind the receptor. All of these findings provide strong evidence that Hfz1 is a functional partner for certain Wnts in inducing TCF dependent transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2317899419,"Ligation of the Fas cell surface receptor leads to activation of caspases and subsequent apoptosis. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins control the cellular commitment to apoptosis, although their role in Fas-induced apoptosis is ill-defined. In this report we demonstrate that the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, translocates from the cytosol specifically to the mitochondria following Fas ligation in MCF10A1 breast epithelial cells. Bax translocation was dependent on caspase activation, and preceded the release of cytochrome c and loss of mitochondrial respiratory activity. Bax translocation occurred in concert with activation of downstream caspases as determined by cleavage of a synthetic substrate, proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and processing of procaspase-3 and -7. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, prevented Bax insertion, cytochrome c release, complete processing of caspase-3 and -7, and full activation of DEVD-specific cleavage activity. These data establish a role for Bax mitochondrial insertion during Fas-mediated apoptosis, and support a model in which Bax insertion amplifies the Fas apoptotic cascade through cytochrome c release and complete processing of caspases-3 and -7. In addition, our findings indicate that prevention of Bax insertion into the mitochondria represents a novel mechanism by which Bcl-2 inhibits Fas-induced apoptosis."

A variation of the patch clamp technique was used to record ion channel activity from intracellular organelles in the presynaptic terminal of the squid. Electron microscopy indicated that mitochondria are numerous in this terminal and are the only organelles compatible with the tips of the pipettes. Before synaptic stimulation, channel activity was infrequent and its conductance was small, although large conductances ( approximately 0.5 to 2.5 nanosiemens) could be detected occasionally. During a train of action potentials, the conductance of the mitochondrial membrane increased up to 60-fold. The conductance increased after a delay of several hundred milliseconds and continued to increase after stimulation had stopped. Recovery occurred over tens of seconds."
https://openalex.org/W2334440180,"prk encodes a protein serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating M phase functions during the cell cycle. We have expressed His6-Prk and His6-Cdc25C proteins using the baculoviral vector expression system. Purified recombinant His6-Prk, but not a kinase-defective mutant His6-PrkK52R, is capable of strongly phosphorylating His6-Cdc25C in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation and affinity column chromatography experiments demonstrate that GST-Prk and native Cdc25C interact. When co-infected with His6-Prk and His6-Cdc25C recombinant baculoviruses, sf-9 cells produce His6-Cdc25C antigen with an additional slower mobility band on denaturing polyacrylamide gels compared with cells infected with His6-Cdc25C baculovirus alone. In addition, His6-Cdc25C immunoprecipitated from sf-9 cells co-infected with His6-Prk and His6-Cdc25C baculoviruses, but not with His6-PrkK52R and His6-Cdc25C baculoviruses, contains a greatly enhanced kinase activity that phosphorylates His6-Cdc25C in vitro. Moreover, phosphopeptide mapping shows that His6-Prk phosphorylates His6-Cdc25C at two sites in vitro and that the major phosphorylation site co-migrates with the one that is phosphorylated in vivo in asynchonized cells. Further studies reveal that His6-Prk phosphorylates Cdc25C on serine216, a residue also phosphorylated by Chk1 and Chk2. Together, these observations strongly suggest that Prk's role in mitosis is at least partly mediated through direct regulation of Cdc25C."
https://openalex.org/W2022870221,"Regulation of gene transcription is an incompletely understood function of nitric oxide (NO). Human leukocytes produce increased amounts of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in response to NO. This effect is associated with decreases in intracellular cAMP, suggesting that NO might regulate gene transcription through promoter sequences sensitive to cAMP such as cAMP response elements (CRE) and Sp1 binding sites. Here we report that a Sp1 binding site in the TNF-α promoter conveys NO responsiveness. Human U937 cells were differentiated for TNF-α production with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. NO donors and H89, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase increased, while dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) decreased TNF-α promoter activity. Deletion or mutation of the proximal Sp1 site, but not the CRE site, abolished the activating effects of NO donors and H89. Further, NO- and H89-mediated increases in TNF-α promoter activity were associated with decreased Sp1 binding. The insertion of Sp1 sites into a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter conferred NO responsiveness, an effect blocked by Bt2cAMP. Mutation of these inserted Sp1 sites prevented this heterologous promoter from responding to NO, H89 and Bt2cAMP. These results identify the Sp1 binding site as a promoter motif that allows NO to control gene transcription. Regulation of gene transcription is an incompletely understood function of nitric oxide (NO). Human leukocytes produce increased amounts of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in response to NO. This effect is associated with decreases in intracellular cAMP, suggesting that NO might regulate gene transcription through promoter sequences sensitive to cAMP such as cAMP response elements (CRE) and Sp1 binding sites. Here we report that a Sp1 binding site in the TNF-α promoter conveys NO responsiveness. Human U937 cells were differentiated for TNF-α production with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. NO donors and H89, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase increased, while dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) decreased TNF-α promoter activity. Deletion or mutation of the proximal Sp1 site, but not the CRE site, abolished the activating effects of NO donors and H89. Further, NO- and H89-mediated increases in TNF-α promoter activity were associated with decreased Sp1 binding. The insertion of Sp1 sites into a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter conferred NO responsiveness, an effect blocked by Bt2cAMP. Mutation of these inserted Sp1 sites prevented this heterologous promoter from responding to NO, H89 and Bt2cAMP. These results identify the Sp1 binding site as a promoter motif that allows NO to control gene transcription. nitric oxide tumor necrosis factor α phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate dibutyryl cAMP cAMP-dependent protein kinase cAMP response element S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine S-nitrosoglutathione polymerase chain reaction tetracyclin tetracyclin-responsive transcriptional activator chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cytomegalovirus electrophoretic mobility shift assay base pair(s) Nitric oxide (NO)1regulates vascular tone (1Huang P.L.

https://openalex.org/W2325991334,"POB1 has been identified as a RalBP1-binding protein and has the Eps15 homology (EH) domain. The EH domain-containing proteins have been suggested to be involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. To clarify the function of POB1, we purified a protein which binds to the EH domain of POB1 from bovine brain cytosol and identified it as Epsin, which is known to bind to the EH domain of Eps15. Epsin has three Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) motifs in the C-terminal region, which are known to form the core sequence for the binding to the EH domain. The EH domain of POB1 interacted directly with the region containing the NPF motifs of Epsin. Expression of Epsin in CHO-IR cells inhibited internalization of insulin although it affected neither insulin-binding nor autophosphorylation activities of the insulin receptor. Taken together with the observations that Epsin is involved in internalization of the receptors for epidermal growth factor and transferrin, these results suggest that Epsin is a binding partner of POB1 and their binding regulates receptor-mediated endocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1981661908,"Overexpression or activation of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) has been observed in many human cancers including breast, lung, colon and gastric carcinomas. We demonstrate that inhibition of the endogenous insulin-like growth factor I receptor by stable expression of a dominant-negative IGF-IR represses the transforming activity in vitro and tumorigenicity of human lung carcinoma cells A549 in vivo. The suppression of tumorigenicity in nude mice is correlated with the induction of glandular differentiation. In addition, functional inhibition of the endogenous receptor dramatically increases the sensitivity of A549 cells to a variety of apoptotic signals including UV irradiation and proteasome inhibitors. These effects are due to the formation of a stable heterocomplex of the dominant-negative receptor with the endogenous wild type receptor which reduces the kinase activity of the latter by twofold. Thus, inhibition of the IGF-IR signaling pathway not only suppresses tumorigenicity but also enhances sensitivity to apoptosis-inducing agents. Antagonizing IGF-IR signaling by promoting tumor differentiation and enhancing sensitivity to apoptotic death are potential cancer therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2050720627,"Spin-dependent tunnel junctions based on magnetically hard and soft ferromagnetic layers separated by a thin insulating barrier have emerged as prime candidates for information storage. However, the observed instability of the magnetically hard reference layer, leading to magnetization decay during field cycling of the adjacent soft layer, is a serious concern for future device applications. Using Lorentz electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, the hard-layer decay was found to result from large fringing fields surrounding magnetic domain walls in the magnetically soft layer. The formation and motion of these walls causes statistical flipping of magnetic moments in randomly oriented grains of the hard layer, with a progressive trend toward disorder and eventual demagnetization."

Cooperative binding of MalT to the array of cognate sites present in the MalT-dependent promoters suggests that promoter binding involves MalT oligomerization. Gel filtration and sedimentation experiments were used to analyze the quaternary structure of MalT in solution in the absence or presence of maltotriose and/or AMP-PNP, ATP, or ADP. The protein is monomeric in the absence of ligands and in the presence of ADP. In the presence of maltotriose, AMP-PNP, or ATP only, the protein self-associates, but a large fraction of the protein remains monomeric. In the presence of both maltotriose and AMP-PNP (ATP or ADP), the protein is essentially oligomeric, with the difference being that the oligomerization is less favored in the presence of ADP + maltotriose than in the presence of AMP-PNP + maltotriose. We present evidence that the association pathway comprises the following steps: monomers → dimers → (MalT) n → aggregates, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 6. From these data, we conclude that the role of maltotriose and ATP as positive effectors is to induce the multimerization of MalT, and hence its cooperative binding to the mal promoters.

Alone or together with CRP (cAMPreceptor protein) MalT activates the promoters of all of the operons comprising the maltose regulon (1Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the synthesis and the activity of the MalT activator are tightly controlled. The expression of the malT gene is modulated by three global regulators, CRP (2Tagami H. Aiba H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), Mlc (3Decker K. Plumbridge J.

Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3059-3061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, MalT activity is negatively regulated by three different proteins, MalK (the ATP-binding component of the maltose transporter), MalY, and Aes via an unknown mechanism (1Boos W. Shuman H.

The only feature that MalT shares with members of another family of transcriptional activators, the LuxR family, is a conserved C-terminal domain (≈10 kDa) that contains the DNA-binding fold (11Vidal-Ingigliardi D.

Dickerson R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (l): 11053-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Transcription activation by MalT depends on the binding of the protein to an array of binding sites located upstream of the −35 region of themal promoters (13Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Richet E. Raibaud O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Danot O. Raibaud O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Richet E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and probably involves a contact between the RNA polymerase and a surface element located on the C-terminal domain of MalT (16Danot O. Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Raibaud O. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Each MalT binding site corresponds to a 10-base pair asymmetric DNA sequence (5′-ggGGa(T/G)GAgg-3′). One distinctive feature of the MalT-dependent promoters is the diversity of arrangement of the MalT sites involved in promoter activation; their numbers (from 3 to 5), their orientations, and their relative locations depend on the promoter. MalT binds cooperatively to all of the activating sites present in each promoter (13Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Richet E. Raibaud O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Danot O. Raibaud O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Richet E. J. Mol.

Cell. 1991; 66: 1185-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which suggests that the MalT sites are not occupied independently by the protein but that the bound protomers interact with each other, directly or indirectly, whatever the configuration of the sites. MalT binds two ligands, maltotriose and (d)ATP, both of which are required for binding to promoter DNA (5Raibaud O. Richet E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3059-3061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although MalT displays a weak ATPase activity, ATP hydrolysis is not required for promoter binding and activation of open complex formation (18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A better understanding of how MalT binds the array of MalT sites present in the mal promoters should be provided by the knowledge of the association state of the protein in solution. In this paper, we have analyzed the association state of MalT by performing gel filtration and sedimentation experiments. Considering that maltotriose and/or ATP might regulate the oligomerization of the protein, we studied both the liganded and the unliganded forms of MalT. We show that the unliganded form of MalT is monomeric and that maltotriose and ATP induce the multimerization of the activator. MalT was purified in the presence of ATP as described (14Danot O. Raibaud O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). ATP-free MalT was obtained essentially as described (18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Purified MalT protein (9 mg) was precipitated by adding 2.2 volumes of 2.9 m (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 0.1 m KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm magnesium acetate, and 10% sucrose. After washing with 10 ml of 2 m(NH4)2SO4 in the same buffer as above, the protein was dissolved in 180 μl of buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7 at 20 °C), 33 mmtri-potassium citrate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose). The protein sample was centrifuged for 2 min in a microcentrifuge to eliminate insoluble material and filtered through a 7.5-ml G-25-Sephadex column (0.6 × 26 cm) equilibrated with buffer D. ATP-free MalT was also prepared by precipitating purified MalT protein with ammonium sulfate and washing the pellet as described above, followed by an overnight dialysis of the solubilized protein against buffer D. The ATP-free MalT preparation (0.8 ml, containing ≈7 mg/ml protein) was at least 90% active as determined by using an abortive initiation assay monitoring the ability of the protein to activate open complex formation at themalPp promoter (18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (The activity routinely displayed by MalT after purification in the presence of ATP is considered to correspond to 100% activity). The protein was stored at −80 °C for several months without any loss of activity. A solution of ATP-free MalT protein was dialyzed against buffer D + 0.5 mm DTT.1 The extinction coefficient of the native protein was determined as described by Lohmanet al. (19Lohman T.M. Chao K.

The MalT polypeptide contains 22 tryptophan residues and 19 tyrosine residues. Assuming that the extinction coefficient of the tryptophane and tyrosine residues in the denatured protein are the same as those of N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide and glycyl-l-tyrosyl-glycine, 5690 and 1280m−1 cm−1, respectively (20Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar), we calculated the extinction coefficient of MalT in 6 mguanidine hydrochloride as ε280,m, denatured = 14.95 × 104m−1cm−1. The molar extinction coefficient of the native protein was then determined as ε280,m, native= (A 280, native × ε280,m, denatured)/A 280, denatured. Determinations made on two different MalT preparations gave a value of ε280, native= (16.2 ± 0.6) × 104m−1 cm−1. The protein concentration of the dialyzed solutions of MalT used to determine the extinction coefficients was also measured according to Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. This yields a value of ε280,1% = 14.8 ± 0.4 ml mg−1cm−1 for the native protein, giving a concentration of 9.1 μm MalT monomers for a 1 mg/ml solution of MalT. This molar concentration value, used throughout this study, is 14% higher than that previously obtained by quantitative amino acid analysis (18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a less accurate technique. Filtration was performed on a Superdex 200 column (3.2 × 300 mm) or a Superose 6 column (3.2 × 300 mm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by using the SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The columns were equilibrated with buffer E (buffer D without sucrose) + 1 mm DTT ± 1 mmmaltotriose ± 0.1 mm AMP-PNP, ATP, or ADP. MalT samples (25 μl) containing various concentrations of MalT in buffer E + 1 mm DTT ± 1 mm maltotriose ± 0.1 mm adenine nucleotide were incubated for 20 min at 20 °C before being injected onto the column through a 20-μl injection loop. Filtration was carried out at 6 or 20 °C at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. The eluted proteins were detected by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. We verified that MalT was not inactivated during the chromatography. The concentration of MalT in the fraction assayed was calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm, and the activity of the protein was determined by using the malPp abortive initiation assay (18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The assay of MalT after filtration of a 20 μm sample in the absence of ligands and after filtration of a 6.4 μm sample in the presence of maltotriose and ATP showed that the protein was ≈100 and ≈80% active, respectively. Samples (56 μl) were prepared as for gel filtration experiments and loaded on a 4.2-ml 5–20% sucrose gradient in buffer E + 1 mm DTT + 50 μg/ml BSA ± 1 mm maltotriose. The gradients were centrifuged in a SW60Ti rotor at 48,000 rpm for 15 h at 4 °C. Twenty-two fractions were collected, and aliquots (20 μl) of the fractions were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. We verified that the protein was not inactivated during the experiment. For this purpose, we determined the concentration of MalT in the peak fraction by quantification on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and tested MalT activity by using the malPp abortive initiation assay (18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The protein recovered was ≈30% active irrespective of whether the sedimentation was performed in the absence or presence of maltotriose. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 4 °C with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an AN 60Ti four-hole rotor and cells with two-channel 12-mm-path-length centerpieces. A 450-μl sample containing 11 μm MalT dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 100 mm tri-potassium citrate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% sucrose, and 0.1 mm AMP-PNP, was centrifuged at 44,000 rpm at 4 °C. Radial scans were taken at 295 nm at 5-min intervals. Data analysis was performed using the computer programs XLA-VELOC (Beckman) and SVEDBERG (22Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston1994: 156-170Crossref Google Scholar). The partial specific volumes of MalT at 4 °C (= 0.729 cm3/g) and at 20 °C ( = 0.735 cm3/g) were calculated from the amino acid composition according to Laue et al.(23Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science.

Springer Verlag, Berlin1986: 45-128Crossref Google Scholar). The solvent density measured at 4 °C was 1.064 g/ml. The viscosity of the buffer at 20 °C was approximated to that of a 10% sucrose solution (η20,10% sucrose = 1.3206 millipascal s). To determine the association state of MalT at various protein concentrations in the presence of different combinations of effectors, we performed gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column by using the SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Because low temperature and citrate anions were known to stabilize MalT in the absence of ATP (18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), gel filtration was performed at 6 °C in the presence of a buffer containing 33 mm tri-potassium citrate. We analyzed the respective effects of maltotriose, ATP, AMP-PNP and ADP, and of any combination of maltotriose and adenine nucleotide. ATP and AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, are equally effective in promoting activation of transcription by MalT in the presence of maltotriose (18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). MalT-ADP is also fully competent for transcription activation in the presence of maltotriose, except that a 5-fold higher concentration of MalT is required to achieve half of the maximum response (18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).2 Maltotriose and the adenine nucleotides were present at saturating concentrations (1 and 0.1 mm, respectively). (In transcription activation assays performed in the presence of ATP and a limiting concentration of MalT, half of the plateau is achieved with 20 μm maltotriose. 2V. Schreiber and E. Richet, unpublished work. The K d for AMP-PNP, ATP, and ADP ≤ 1, 0.5, and 3 μm, respectively, as measured at ≈1 μmMalT (18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).) Prior to filtration, the protein samples were incubated for 20 min at 20 °C in filtration buffer supplemented with the effector(s) in case any putative conformational change would be rate-limited at low temperature (25Schwartz M. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 1482-1502Google Scholar). The column was calibrated with globular proteins of known molecular mass (Fig. 1). Note that the elution volume is actually a function of the logarithm of the Stokes radius of the protein and that a protein with an asymmetrical shape elutes earlier than a globular protein of the same molecular mass, i.e. that the position of a discrete peak only provides an upper limit to the size of the protein. Gel filtration of 23 μm MalT in the absence of any ligand gave a symmetrical peak at the position of a 100-kDa globular protein (Fig.2 A). Given the size of the MalT polypeptide, this indicates that the unliganded form of the protein is monomeric. This conclusion is consistent with the sedimentation coefficient s 20,wof MalT (5.8 S) measured by sedimentation through a sucrose gradient in the absence of ligands, which corresponds to that of an ≈105-kDa globular protein (Fig. 3 A). (Because the sedimentation coefficient is proportional to the molecular mass of the protein and inversely proportional to its frictional coefficient, a sedimentation coefficient value gives only a minimal estimate of the molecular mass of the protein analyzed).Figure 3Sedimentation through sucrose gradients. MalT samples (6 μm) were sedimented through sucrose gradients at 4 °C, and the fractions collected were analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The peak positions of standard globular proteins are indicated: sweet potato β-amylase (8.9 S, 200 kDa), rabbit muscle aldolase (7.4 S, 158 kDa), BSA (4.2 S, 66 kDa), hen ovalbumin (3.5 S, 45 kDa), bovine carbonic anhydrase (2.8 S, 29 kDa). The protein band below the MalT band corresponds to the BSA present in the gradient buffer. A, in the absence of ligands; B, in the presence of maltotriose. The asymmetry of the MalT peak observed in the presence of maltotriose is likely due to the presence of faster sedimenting multimeric forms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2 Bshows the data obtained when samples containing increasing concentrations of MalT (8–47 μm) were subjected to gel filtration in the presence of AMP-PNP. The major peak observed was symmetrical and eluted at the position of a 100-kDa globular protein. This peak was preceded by a small asymmetrical peak (≈18% of the total amount of protein at 47 μm MalT) the position of which shifted toward smaller retention volumes as MalT concentration was raised. For the concentration range examined, the small peak eluted at positions ranging from that of a 260-kDa globular protein to that of a 530-kDa protein. Hence, these data indicate that MalT is principally monomeric in the presence of AMP-PNP but that it shows a slight tendency to multimerize. The progressive increase of the apparent molecular mass of the peak of MalT multimers suggests the presence of several multimeric species in rapid equilibrium on the time scale of the chromatography, the position of the peak reflecting the weighted average Stokes radius of the species in equilibrium. It is unlikely that interactions with the matrix of the Superdex column (cross-linked agarose and dextran) cause the size of the major AMP-PNP/MalT form to be underestimated, because MalT also eluted as a 100-kDa globular protein when filtered at 20 °C in the presence of AMP-PNP through a Superose 12 column (cross-linked agarose only) (data not shown). That the AMP-PNP bound form of MalT is primarily monomeric is also consistent with the result of a velocity sedimentation experiment performed at 4 °C with 11 μm MalT in the presence of AMP-PNP, which gave a sedimentation coefficients 20,w of 5.4 S for the predominant form (which corresponds to that of an ≈95-kDa globular protein) (data not shown). Gel filtration of 23 μm MalT in the presence of ATP or ADP gave profiles identical to that obtained with AMP-PNP except that no multimeric species were observed in the presence of ADP (data not shown). Complex chromatograms were obtained when MalT was subjected to gel filtration in the presence of maltotriose alone (Fig. 4). At a low concentration (1 μm), the protein eluted as a symmetrical peak at the position of a 105-kDa globular protein. Raising the concentration of MalT caused the appearance of a discrete 220-kDa peak with increasing magnitude. At 47 μm MalT, a third major peak appeared at the position of an ≈600-kDa protein, i.e.still within the optimal separation range of the column (see Fig. 1). The simplest interpretation of these data is that MalT multimerizes in the presence of maltotriose, provided that the protein concentration is high enough, and that the association pathway involves at least two steps, a dimerization step followed by a higher-order association step. The fact that the three peaks are resolvable indicates that the rate of conversion between the monomers, the dimers, and the higher order association forms is rather slow on the time scale of the chromatography. The 600-kDa peak observed at 47 μm MalT does not correspond to a unique species because it moved to a smaller elution volume, 1.04 ml, i.e. to the position of a 710-kDa globular protein, when 91 μm MalT was injected (data not shown). This peak most likely contains several rapidly equilibrating self-associated species, which would also explain the sharpness of the peak front; the higher molecular mass forms present in the leading edge of the peak would dissociate during filtration. The 600-kDa peak might contain a discrete size multimer (possibly a tetramer or a hexamer) in fast equilibrium with self-associated forms of the multimer whence the shift observed when MalT concentration was further increased. That MalT is actually monomeric at 1 μm in the presence of maltotriose is consistent with the observation that at low concentration, MalT has a sedimentation coefficients 20,w of 5.9 S, which corresponds to that of an ≈110-kDa globular protein (Fig. 3 B). Gel filtration of MalT at 6 °C in the presence of both maltotriose and AMP-PNP gave two peaks, a minor one, corresponding to the monomeric species, and a major one that was asymmetric and the position of which shifted to smaller retention volumes as MalT concentration was raised (Fig.5). As shown by the plot of Fig.6, the apparent molecular mass of the major peak increased progressively from 340 kDa at 2.3 μmMalT to ≈800 kDa at 91 μm MalT without reaching a limiting value. These data reveal that, when present together, maltotriose and AMP-PNP strongly favor the self-association of MalT. At ≈2 μm, the protein is indeed multimeric in the presence of maltotriose and AMP-PNP, whereas at the same concentration, it is monomeric in the absence of ligands or in the presence of maltotriose or AMP-PNP alone (see Figs. 2, A and B, and 4). The curve representing the apparent molecular mass of MalT in the presence of maltotriose + AMP-PNP at 6 °C (Fig. 6) is characterized by an inflection at around 550 kDa, which suggests that the self-association reaction induced by maltotriose and AMP-PNP comprises at least two steps. The first step might lead to the formation of a discrete size multimer, (MalT) n, possibly the multimer present in the 600-kDa peak observed in the presence of maltotriose alone. The continuous shift of the peak position is best explained by the presence of several species in rapid equilibrium, e.g. the (MalT) n form and lower molecular mass species, the fraction of material in the (MalT) n form increasing with the protein concentration. The second step might involve self-association of the (MalT) n form, as observed in the presence of maltotriose alone.Figure 6Apparent molecular mass of MalT in the presence of maltotriose +AMP-PNP, ATP or ADP at 6 and 20 °C. The apparent molecular mass of the major peak obtained after filtration of MalT on a Superdex 200 column in the presence of maltotriose and AMP-PNP, ATP, or ADP is plotted as a function of the concentration of MalT in the injected samples. T, maltotriose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Gel filtration experiments were also performed in the presence of maltotriose and AMP-PNP at 20 °C, a more physiological temperature. The results were similar to those obtained at 6 °C except that at all MalT concentrations tested, the apparent molecular mass of the major peak was higher at 20 than at 6 °C (Figs. 6 and7). The degree of association of MalT is thus higher at 20 than at 6 °C, but interestingly, the difference was much more pronounced at 23 μm MalT (900versus 560 kDa) than at 2.3 and 4.6 μm MalT (400 and 530 kDa versus 340 and 440 kDa, respectively) (Fig.6), suggesting that the temperature preferentially affects the second step of the association process. Because the samples were preincubated at 20 °C before gel filtration both at 6 and 20 °C, the high molecular mass species formed during preincubation at 20 °C most likely underwent some dissociation during gel filtration at 6 °C. The formation of high molecular mass material observed at 20 °C depended on the presence of both AMP-PNP and maltotriose; the filtration profiles obtained at 20 °C in the absence of ligands or in the presence of only one of the ligands were similar to those obtained at 6 °C (data not shown). Because the useful separation range of a Superdex 200 column might not extend much beyond 600 kDa, the apparent size of the material eluting at 1 ml on the Superdex 200 column at 20 °C might be somewhat underestimated (Fig. 7). Hence, the size of the multimers formed at 20 °C in the presence of both maltotriose and AMP-PNP was evaluated by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column, for which the useful separation range extends up to 5000 kDa. Injection of samples containing 23 and 46 μm MalT gave major peaks at the positions of a 1200- and a 2200-kDa protein, respectively, and a minor peak at the position of a 100-kDa protein (data not shown). MalT thus forms very large aggregates at 20 °C at high protein concentrations (≥20 μm). Given the size of the protein complexes, we believe that the last step of the association process, which seems to be specifically favored at high temperature, corresponds to unlimited aggregation. Gel filtration of MalT in the presence of maltotriose + ATP or ADP gave profiles similar to those obtained in the presence of maltotriose and AMP-PNP except that, in both cases, at any MalT concentration tested, the major peak eluted later than observed in the presence of maltotriose and AMP-PNP (Figs. 6 and 8, data not shown). In the presence of maltotriose + ATP, an ≈2-fold higher concentration of MalT was required to obtain the same apparent molecular mass as in the presence of maltotriose + AMP-PNP, whereas an ≈7-fold higher concentration of MalT was required to obtain the same apparent molecular mass in the presence of maltotriose + ADP. It is worth noting that the association state of the protein is nevertheless clearly higher in the presence of maltotriose + ADP than in the presence of maltotriose alone (compare Figs. 8 and 4). Thus, both ATP and ADP promote MalT self-association in the presence of maltotriose, but ADP is clearly less effective than ATP, which is itself less effective than AMP-PNP. The results of the gel filtration and sedimentation experiments reported in this paper reveal several features of the association state of MalT in the absence or presence of its effectors, maltotriose and ATP. We clearly establish that: (i) the unliganded form of the protein is monomeric; (ii) when present alone, each effector, maltotriose or AMP-PNP (or ATP), induces a partial multimerization of MalT; and (iii) MalT self-associates in the presence of both effectors. The data do not allow a precise determination of the size of the multimer(s) formed by MalT in the presence of maltotriose and AMP-PNP. Consideration of all of the data obtained in the presence of maltotriose alone and in the presence of maltotriose + AMP-PNP, however, suggests the following association pathway: monomer → dimer → (MalT) n → unlimited aggregates, where (MalT) n would be a discrete size multimer, possibly a tetramer or a hexamer. Such a model accounts for the three peaks observed by gel filtration in the presence of maltotriose alone, the two discrete peaks corresponding to the dimer and the monomer and the early peak, which first appears at 600 kDa and the apparent molecular mass of which increases as the concentration of MalT is raised. This last peak is presumed to contain the (MalT) n multimer in rapid equilibrium with aggregates of this multimer. This scheme also accounts for the association reaction induced by maltotriose and AMP-PNP, which is characterized by two phases with the transition at ≈550 kDa at 6 °C (see Fig. 6). The first phase (up to ≈10 μm MalT) would reflect the formation of the (MalT) n multimer, and the major peak would contain the (MalT) n form in rapid equilibrium with dimer and/or monomer. (Because we could not decrease the concentration of the protein below 2 μm, we do not know whether MalT is dimeric or monomeric at low concentrations in the presence of both maltotriose and AMP-PNP. Also, because the small peak of monomers that is always observed in the presence of maltotriose and AMP-PNP might correspond to inactive protein, it is possible that monomers are part of the rapid equilibrium). The second phase (MalT >10 μm) would correspond to unlimited aggregation of MalT. This conclusion is based on the observation that raising the temperature scarcely affects the degree of association of the protein observed by gel filtration at low MalT concentrations (<10 μm), whereas it leads to the formation of very large aggregates at higher concentrations. Whether the large MalT aggregates correspond to polymers or unordered aggregates of the (MalT) n multimer is unknown. It is somewhat surprising that the dimers and the higher order association species formed in the presence of maltotriose give two distinct peaks, whereas in the presence of both maltotriose and AMP-PNP, one unique peak is obtained, which shifts smoothly toward higher apparent molecular masses as the MalT concentration is raised. Provided that the model proposed is correct, this may mean that the binding of AMP-PNP by the maltotriose-bound form not only results in an increase of the association equilibrium constant of the dimer → (MalT) n step but that it also increases the association and dissociation rate constants. Several lines of evidence indicate that the multimerization reaction corresponding to the first phase of the self-association process induced by maltotriose + AMP-PNP is involved in the assembly of the nucleoprotein complexes formed by MalT at the mal promoters. First, cooperative binding of MalT to the array of MalT sites present in all of the mal promoters (13Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Richet E. Raibaud O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Danot O. Raibaud O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Richet E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) indicates that promoter binding involves an oligomeric form of the protein. Second, both MalT oligomerization and promoter binding depend on the presence of ATP and maltotriose. Third, there is a correlation between the relative abilities of AMP-PNP and ADP to promote the self-association of MalT and transcription activation in the presence of maltotriose. Indeed, as shown here, both AMP-PNP and ADP induce self-association of MalT in the presence of maltotriose, the difference being that association of the ADP-bound forms is less favored; a 7-fold higher concentration of MalT is required to achieve the same degree of association in the presence of maltotriose + ADP as in the presence of maltotriose + AMP-PNP. Similarly, comparative malPp activation assays showed that the ADP-MalT form is fully competent for transcription activation in the presence of maltotriose, except that a 5-fold higher concentration of MalT was required to achieve the half-maximum response compared with what was observed with the AMP-PNP bound forms (18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).2 (Both gel filtration and activation assays were performed in the presence of saturating concentrations of ligands, thereby excluding the possibility that the reduced abilities of ADP-MalT to multimerize or activate open complex formation were the result of incomplete saturation of the ligand binding sites.) The lower activity of the ADP-MalT form most likely reflects a lower affinity for promoter DNA resulting from a reduced ability to multimerize. How the nucleoprotein structures assemble at the mal promoters remains unclear, in particular because we do not know the association state of the activator at concentrations (10–100 nm) at which promoter binding is observed in vitro. The arrays of MalT sites in themal promoters might be bound by a MalT multimer present in solution. Alternatively, the DNA could act as a ligand to promote the assembly of the MalT oligomer in situ from monomers (or dimers). In the presence of maltotriose + ATP, the degree of association of MalT is intermediate between that observed in the presence of maltotriose + AMP-PNP and that observed in the presence of maltotriose + ADP; this is best explained by the presence of both ATP- and ADP-bound forms due to ATP hydrolysis by the protein. This result contrasts with the observation that ATP is as effective as AMP-PNP in promoting transcription activation (18Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the discrepancy between the two sets of data might be only apparent and reflect some differences in the experimental conditions. The unlimited aggregation that is observed at high concentrations of MalT and that is strongly favored at 20 °C is unlikely to be functionally relevant. It is possible, nevertheless, that this aggregation phenomenon reflects a unique association event that would occur in situ during the assembly of the nucleoprotein structure at complex MalT-dependent promoters such asmalEp/malKp (15Richet E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that would be both directed and limited by the spatial arrangement of the MalT binding sites. The unlimited aggregation of MalT observed here probably also accounts for the inhibition of transcription observed in vivo and in vitro at high concentrations of MalT (25Schwartz M. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

The 10.5-base pair period pattern of alternative enhancements and diminutions of the sensitivity to DNase I attack observed at some mal promoters outside of the protected regions might also be explained by MalT aggregation nucleated by MalT bound to its cognate sites (13Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Richet E. Raibaud O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Raibaud O. Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Richet E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 471-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One major conclusion of this work is that maltotriose and ATP regulate MalT activity by controlling the self-association of the protein, a step thought to precede or accompany cooperative binding of the activator to promoter DNA. Furthermore, the observation that, in the presence of maltotriose, AMP-PNP favors MalT multimerization to a greater extent than ADP suggests that in vivo ATP hydrolysis by MalT might be coupled to the disassembly of the multimer formed by the protein or of the nucleoprotein structures assembled at the malpromoters. MalT self-association, which is expected to be crucial for promoter binding, is hence the target of several of the controls to which the activator is subjected, i.e. the inducer, ATP, and ATP hydrolysis. So far, only a few prokaryotic transcriptional activators have been shown to self-associate in response to the binding of a ligand or covalent modification. One such example is the ς54-specific activators the oligomerization of which is modulated by the binding of effector(s) or covalent modification, as shown with XylR and NtrC. XylR multimerization, which occurs upon UAS binding, seems to depend on the binding of both the inducer and ATP (28Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. Cell. 1996; 86: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarly, the self-assembly of the NtrC dimer into an octamer, which is coupled to UAS binding, depends on NtrC phosphorylation (29Rippe K. Mücke N. Schulz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 915-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A second example is the TyrR dimer, an activator of ς70-dependent promoters, which contains a central domain that is homologous to the ATP-binding domain of the ς54-specific activators and for which assembly into a hexamer depends on the binding of two effectors, ATP and tyrosine (or phenylalanine) (30Wilson T.J. Maroudas P. Howlett G.J. Davidson B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Yet another example is the anti-terminator BglG, the dimerization of which is negatively controlled by phosphorylation (31Amster-Choder O. Wright A. Science. 1992; 257: 1395-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, MalT is the fourth type of prokaryotic regulator with the association state shown to be modulated by the binding of ligands. It is noteworthy that most of the transcriptional activators known to self-associate in response to a specific signal have their assembly state also controlled by ATP and have ATPase activity. It is tempting to propose that, in all of these cases, ATP hydrolysis is coupled to dissociation of the oligomeric structure formed by the protein, as inferred for XylR (28Pérez-Martı́n J. de Lorenzo V. Cell. 1996; 86: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and as suggested for MalT.

To characterize the backbone conformation of protein folding intermediates that are recognized by the chaperone, we prepared the uniformly 13C-labeled αA-crystallin. The labeling greatly reduced the overlapping between the conformation-sensitive amide I bands of α-crystallin and unlabeled substrate proteins. This procedure has allowed us to gain insight into the secondary structure of α-crystallin-bound species, an understanding which has previously been unattainable. Analysis of the infrared spectra of two substrate proteins (γ- and βL-crystallins) indicates that heat-destabilized conformers captured by α-crystallin are characterized by a high proportion of native-like secondary structure. In contrast to the chaperone-bound species, the same proteins subjected to heat treatment in the absence of α-crystallin preserve very little native secondary structure. These data show that α-crystallin specifically recognizes very early intermediates on the denaturation pathway of proteins. These aggregation-prone species are characterized by native-like secondary structure but compromised tertiary interactions. The experimental approach described in this study can be further applied to probe the backbone conformation of proteins bound to chaperones other than α-crystallin. α-Crystallin, the major lens protein, acts as a molecular chaperone by preventing the aggregation of proteins damaged by heat and other stress conditions.

John Wiley & Sons, New York1981: 279-326Google Scholar). The protein consists of two types of highly homologous 20-kDa chains, αA and αB. These chains self-associate, forming large oligomeric complexes consisting of 30–40 subunits (1Horwitz J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1993; 34: 10-21PubMed Google Scholar, 2Groenen P.J.T.A.

Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Eye Lens. John Wiley & Sons, New York1981: 279-326Google Scholar). The high resolution structure of α-crystallin is currently unknown. However, recent cryo-electron microscopy data for αB-crystallin indicate that the protein forms spherical particles with a diameter of 8–18 nm and a large central cavity (4Haley D.A. Horwitz J. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For many years it was believed that the expression of α-crystallin was restricted to the ocular lens. More recently, relatively large quantities of both αB- and αA-crystallin have been found in various non-lenticular tissues (5Iwaki T. Kume-Iwaki A. Liem R.K.H. Goldman J.E.

Furthermore, αB-crystallin has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such Alexander's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Alzheimer's disease (5Iwaki T. Kume-Iwaki A. Liem R.K.H. Goldman J.E. Cell. 1989; 57: 71-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 6Lowe J. McDermott H. Pike I. Spendlove I. Landon M. Mayer R.J. J.

These findings were accompanied by data showing that α-crystallin belongs to the family of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs)1 (2Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 8Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 155-201PubMed Google Scholar, 9Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). While sHSPs are abundant both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, no obvious function has been associated with these proteins. An important step toward unraveling the functional role of α-crystallin and related sHSPs was the discovery that these proteins act as molecular chaperones by preventing the aggregation of other proteins denatured by heat or other stress conditions (10Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 11Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chaperone function of α-crystallin is likely to be of considerable importance in vivo. In particular, the above function was suggested to be instrumental in the prevention of cataract formation in the ocular lens (10Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 13Rao P.V. Huang Q.-L. Horwitz J. Zigler J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In non-lenticular tissues, the role of sHSPs may be to maintain substrate proteins in a folding-competent state (15Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 16Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). It was shown that α-crystallin specifically binds aggregation-prone structures that occur on the denaturation pathway of proteins (17Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A key to understanding the molecular basis of this apparent “substrate specificity,” is to determine the conformational properties of non-native proteins recognized by this chaperone. Although recent fluorescence studies provided some insight into the tertiary structure of these species (18Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Lindner R.A. Kapur A. Mariani M. Titmuss S.J. Carver J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 170-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), important information at the level of protein secondary structure is still missing. Determination of the secondary structure of individual components in large protein-protein complexes presents a difficult experimental problem. To circumvent these difficulties, herein, we have applied the strategy of “isotope-edited” infrared spectroscopy. The present data shows that the aggregation prone folding intermediates captured by α-crystallin are characterized by a high proportion of native secondary structure. Cloning of human αA-crystallin has been previously described (18Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31973-31980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The protein was overexpressed inEscherichia coli strain JM101 essentially as outlined in our previous study (18Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To obtain 13C-labeled αA-crystallin, cells were cultured in the presence of MOPS-buffered minimum medium containing a mixture of trace minerals, ammonium chloride, and uniformly 13C-labeled glucose (2 mg per 400 ml of culture) as a sole carbon source. The protein was purified by the standard protocol (18Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), dialyzed against 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and freeze-dried. The oligomerization state, far/near-UV circular dichroism spectra, FTIR spectra, as well as the chaperone activity of αA-crystallin were unaffected by the lyophilization/buffer reconstitution procedure. The low molecular mass β- (βL) and γ-crystallins were isolated from young bovine lenses and purified as described previously (17Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To prepare protein-protein complexes for FTIR measurements, lyophilized13C-labeled αA-crystallin was dissolved in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, and combined with either γ- or βL-crystallin at a 1:0.8 molar ratio of αA monomer to the substrate protein monomer. The mixtures were then incubated for 30 min at 65 °C. In the absence of the chaperone, the thermally denaturated γ- and βL-crystallins aggregate. However, α-crystallin prevents the aggregation, forming water-soluble complexes with these proteins (10Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 11Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation, the samples were cooled down to room temperature, and the complexes were separated from the residual free substrate proteins (approximately 18 and 9% for γ- and βL-crystallin, respectively) by filtration on a 100-kDa cut-off Microcon filter as described previously (18Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The molar ratio of α-crystallin to the substrate protein in a given complex was estimated by subtracting the amount of the unbound substrate recovered in the filtrate (as determined spectrophotometrically) from the initial amount of this protein in the incubation mixture (18Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The absence of unbound substrates in the final samples was verified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 HR column (data not shown for brevity). Samples of thermally aggregated γ- and βL-crystallins were obtained by high temperature (65 °C) incubation of these proteins in the absence of αA-crystallin. The aggregates were collected by low-speed centrifugation and resuspended in the buffer. Because water interferes with infrared spectroscopic measurements, the buffer used in these studies was prepared in2H2O. Samples of a soluble or aggregated protein were placed between two calcium fluoride windows separated by a 50-μm thick spacer. Infrared spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker IFS 66 instrument. Typically, 500 interferograms were averaged and Fourier-transformed to give a resolution of 2 cm−1. Before further processing, spectra in the 1500–1800 cm−1region were corrected for the weak absorption of the2H2O buffer and, if necessary, for the residual water vapor signal. The technique of Fourier self-deconvolution was used to resolve the overlapping infrared bands (21Kauppinen J.K. Moffatt D.J. Mantsch H.H. Cameron D.C. Appl. Spectrosc. 1981; 35: 271-276Crossref Google Scholar, 22Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). The secondary structure content was estimated by curve fitting of original (non-deconvolved) amide I band contours (22Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Infrared spectroscopy is an established method for studying the secondary structure of proteins (22Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 23Byler M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 26: 469-487Crossref Scopus (2739) Google Scholar, 24Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). However, the application of this technique to determine the backbone conformation of individual components in protein-protein complexes is complicated by the overlapping of the spectroscopic signals from the two macromolecules. To circumvent this fundamental problem and facilitate studies with the chaperone-bound proteins, we have prepared a uniformly13C-labeled αA-crystallin. It was verified that the labeling did not affect the chaperone function of the protein as indicated by an essentially identical ability of both the labeled and unlabeled αA-crystallin to suppress the thermal aggregation of γ- and βL-crystallins. Consistent with the previous data (25Lamba O.P. Borchman D. Sinha S.K. Shah J. Renugopalakrishnan V. Yappert M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Surewicz W.K. Olesen P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9655-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the conformation-sensitive amide I band of unlabeled αA-crystallin has a maximum at 1632 cm−1. Upon labeling, the maximum of this band shifted to 1591 cm−1 (Fig.1 A, trace 1). The observed shift of the amide I band by 41 cm−1 toward lower frequency is consistent with theoretical predictions as well as limited experimental data available for other proteins (27Tadesse L. Nazarbaghi R. Walter L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 7036-7037Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 28Haris P.I. Robillard G.T. van Dijk A.A. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Zhang M. Fabian H. Mantsch H.H. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10833-10888Google Scholar). Importantly,13C-labeling of α-crystallin greatly reduced the overlapping of its amide I band with that of the unlabeled substrate protein. This opened up a possibility of analysis of the amide I bands (and thus the secondary structure) of the chaperone-bound proteins. To test this approach, we first analyzed the infrared spectrum of an “inert” mixture of 13C-labeled αA-crystallin with an unlabeled γ-crystallin incubated at room temperature. Under these conditions, there is no complex formation between these two proteins (11Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the spectrum of the above mixture shows well separated maxima corresponding to13C-αA-crystallin (1591 cm−1) and γ-crystallin (1637 cm−1). While the high frequency region above approximately 1650 cm−1 of the amide I band of γ-crystallin contains very little contribution from α-crystallin, a considerable spectral overlapping still exists at lower wave numbers. However, this residual overlapping can be easily removed by subtracting the spectrum of 13C-αA-crystallin alone. The well separated 1591 cm−1 band maximum of the latter protein serves as an invaluable marker for determining the subtraction factor (γ-crystallin and most other proteins contain no infrared bands with a maximum at 1591 cm−1). In our experience, the subtraction factor can be reliably determined using the original spectra. However, the procedure is especially accurate when applied to spectra subjected to band-narrowing by Fourier self-deconvolution. As an illustration, Fig. 1 B shows the infrared spectrum of γ-crystallin when measured alone (trace 1) and the one obtained upon applying the subtraction procedure to the spectrum of an inert mixture of 13C-αA-crystallin and γ-crystallin (trace 2). The spectra of γ-crystallin represented by traces 1 and 2 are indistinguishable, clearly demonstrating the validity of the experimental approach used in this study. The amide I band of the native γ-crystallin exhibits a maximum at 1637 cm−1 (Fig. 2,trace 1). As for other proteins, the observed amide I band contour is a composite of overlapping components which represent different elements of protein secondary structure (22Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 23Byler M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 26: 469-487Crossref Scopus (2739) Google Scholar, 24Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). These components can be better resolved by Fourier self-deconvolution (21Kauppinen J.K. Moffatt D.J. Mantsch H.H. Cameron D.C. Appl. Spectrosc. 1981; 35: 271-276Crossref Google Scholar,22Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). The deconvolved spectrum of the native γ-crystallin is dominated by a very strong band at 1636 cm−1 (Fig.3, trace 1). This band is highly characteristic of a β-sheet structure (22Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 23Byler M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 26: 469-487Crossref Scopus (2739) Google Scholar, 24Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). All other amide I component bands are much weaker. These bands may be assigned to α-helix (1656 cm−1) and turns (1665 and 1686 cm−1). The band at 1673 cm−1 likely represents β-sheet structure, although this band may also contain contributions from turns. The fractional areas of these bands, which provide an estimate of protein secondary structure (22Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 23Byler M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 26: 469-487Crossref Scopus (2739) Google Scholar), are shown in Table I. Overall, the data indicates that the secondary structure of the protein consists largely of β-strands and little α-helical structure. A very high content of β-sheet structure in γ-crystallin is fully consistent with the crystallographic data (30Wistow G. Turnell B. Summers L. Slingsby C. Moss D. Miller L. Lindley P. Blundell T. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 175-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the crystal structure of γ-II crystallin also indicates the presence of short α-helical regions (30Wistow G. Turnell B. Summers L. Slingsby C. Moss D. Miller L. Lindley P. Blundell T. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 175-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Figure 3Infrared spectra of γ-crystallin after band narrowing by Fourier self-deconvolution using a 15 cm−1 half-width Lorenzian line and a resolution enhancement factor of 2.2.

Open table in a new tab Numbers in parentheses represent the fractional area of the individual bands. The infrared spectrum of γ-crystallin bound to α-crystallin was obtained by subtracting the signal of 13C-labeled αA-crystallin from the spectrum of the thermally prepared protein-protein complex. To ensure reliable subtraction, a control sample of 13C-labeled αA-crystallin alone was pretreated in the same way as the protein used to prepare the complex. The amide I band contour of the chaperone-bound γ-crystallin (Fig. 2, trace 2) has a maximum at 1637 cm−1, and its overall shape is remarkably similar to that of the native protein. Upon deconvolution (Fig. 3, trace 2), the spectrum shows a dominant β-sheet band at 1634 cm−1. A small shift of this band to lower frequency as compared with the 1636 cm−1 β-sheet band in the spectrum of the native protein likely reflects a higher degree of hydrogen-deuterium exchange in the chaperone-bound protein. Consistent with the visual inspection of the spectra, quantitative analysis indicates that the secondary structure of the chaperone bound γ-crystallin is characterized by only slightly decreased content of β-sheet structure (approximately 61% versus 66% in the native protein), whereas the content of α-helical structure remains essentially unchanged. In contrast to the close similarity of the amide I bands of the native and α-crystallin-bound γ-crystallin, a dramatically different spectrum was observed for γ-crystallin thermally denatured in the absence of the chaperone (Figs. 2 and 3,traces 3). Characteristic features of the latter spectrum include the strong band at 1618 cm−1 and a band at 1694 cm−1. The 1618 cm−1 band, which accounts for approximately 22% of the total area of amide I contour, likely represents intermolecularly hydrogen-bonded β-strands (22Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 31Fraser P.E. Nguyen J. Surewicz W.K. Kirschner D.A. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 1190-1201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), Importantly, the appearance of this new band was accompanied by a drastic reduction (to approximately 18%) in the integrated intensity of the native β-sheet band around 1636 cm−1. A very similar trend was observed for another lens protein studied, βL-crystallin. This protein is also characterized by a high content of β-structure (25Lamba O.P. Borchman D. Sinha S.K. Shah J. Renugopalakrishnan V. Yappert M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Bax B. Lapatto R. Nalini V. Driessen H. Lindley P.F. Mahadevan D. Blundell T.L. Slingsby C. Nature. 1990; 347: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The deconvolved spectrum of the native βL-crystallin shows a major β-sheet band at 1631 cm−1 (Fig. 4). This band, together with a weaker β-structure-characteristic band at 1673 cm−1, account for 40% of the total area of the amide I contour (Table I). The prominent 1631 cm−1 band is also seen in the spectrum of the chaperone-bound βL-crystallin, although its integrated intensity is somewhat decreased. Compared with the native protein, the overall content of β-sheet structure in the bound βL-crystallin is reduced from approximately 40 to 36% (Table I). In contrast to this relatively small change, a much more drastic perturbation of the secondary structure was observed for βL-crystallin subjected to heat treatment in the absence of the chaperone. The spectrum of this protein (Fig. 4, trace 3) shows a dominant band at 1618 cm−1 (27% of the total area of amide I band contour) and is very similar to that of the thermally denaturated γ-crystallin. The integrated intensity of the native β-sheet band around 1631 cm−1 is reduced to 3%, indicating that thermally aggregated βL-crystallin preserves very little native secondary structure. The family of molecular chaperones includes a number of structurally unrelated proteins that share the common property of being able to recognize and bind non-native conformers of other proteins. By doing so, they prevent unwanted intermolecular interactions and, in certain cases, facilitate the correct folding of substrate proteins (33Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev.

Some members of the chaperone family (e.g. HSP60) have ATPase activity and are directly involved in protein foldingin vivo. Many others, however, lack ATPase activity and play a less defined auxiliary role in the cell. α-Crystallin and other sHSPs belong to this second group of chaperones. These chaperones appear to act as a passive binder of non-native proteins in response to cellular stress conditions (34Jakob U. Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). There has been great interest in characterizing the specific conformational states of non-native proteins recognized by molecular chaperones. For example, DnaK binds polypeptide chains in a completely extended conformation. HSP60, on the other hand, associates with relatively compact protein folding intermediates, whereas HSP90 appears to have dual substrate specificity (33Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 34Jakob U. Buchner J. Trends Biochem.

In contrast to these chaperones, very little specific information is available regarding the conformation of proteins recognized by sHSPs. The present study provides, for the first time, a direct insight into the secondary structure of non-native proteins bound to α-crystallin. To obtain this information, we have used a strategy of isotope-edited infrared spectroscopy. Uniform 13C-labeling of the recombinant αA-crystallin protein greatly reduced the overlapping between its amide I band and the respective bands of substrate proteins. This allowed infrared spectroscopic analysis of the secondary structure of α-crystallin-bound species. At a qualitative level, the main conclusions of this study were already evident from a simple visual comparison of the spectra of free- and chaperone-bound proteins. These conclusions were further reinforced by a quantitative band-fitting analysis. Although quantitative determination of protein secondary structure by band-fitting of infrared spectra is not without pitfalls and limitations (24Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar), the procedure is of proven value when used to assess, in relative terms, the extent of conformational changes in proteins. Overall, the results of this study show that the secondary structure of non-native proteins bound to α-crystallin is similar to that of native conformers. Remarkably, for both γ- and βL-crystallin, the content of native β-sheet structure in the chaperone-bound species appears to be reduced by no more than 10%. This contrasts with a greatly diminished native secondary structure of the same proteins denatured in the absence of the chaperone. While in this study we have focused on lens proteins interacting with their physiologically relevant chaperone, α-crystallin, the present data are likely representative of non-native proteins bound to sHSPs. Furthermore, the experimental approach described in this work should prove useful for studying conformational properties of proteins bound to other members of the chaperone family. It was previously demonstrated that α-crystallin has an enormous capacity for binding non-native proteins on the denaturation pathway, but apparently does not interact with the intermediates that occur on the refolding pathway (17Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that the non-native proteins associated with α-crystallin are characterized by an increased surface hydrophobicity and partially compromised tertiary interactions (18Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Lindner R.A. Kapur A. Mariani M. Titmuss S.J. Carver J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 170-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The present data extends these observations, affording a more detailed insight into the substrate specificity of α-crystallin. In particular, the finding that the conformationally compromised proteins recognized by this chaperone retain a high proportion of native-like secondary structure provides crucial experimental support to the earlier hypothesis (18Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that α-crystallin and other sHSPs interact specifically with aggregation-prone folding intermediates that occur very early on the denaturation pathway. The complexes of sHSPs with such intermediates may provide a reservoir for other components of the chaperone machinery to renature the bound proteins (15Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 16Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In the context of eye research, recent data indicate that the aggregation of lens proteins under physiologically relevant stress conditions such as oxidative stress or ultraviolet radiation is accompanied by only small loss of native secondary structure. 2W. K. Surewicz, L. P. Choo-Smith, and K. P. Das, unpublished data. Therefore, the substrate specificity of α-crystallin described above is fully consistent with the postulated role of this protein as a chaperone that protects the transparency of the ocular lens."
https://openalex.org/W2150597990,"The lactose transport protein (LacS) ofStreptococcus thermophilus catalyzes the uptake of lactose in an exchange reaction with intracellularly formed galactose. The interactions between the substrate and the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of LacS have been characterized by assaying binding and transport of a range of sugars in proteoliposomes, in which the purified protein was reconstituted with a unidirectional orientation. Specificity for galactoside binding is given by the spatial configuration of the C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-6 hydroxyl groups of the galactose moiety. Except for a C-4 methoxy substitution, replacement of the hydroxyl groups for bulkier groups is not tolerated at these positions. Large hydrophobic or hydrophilic substitutions on the galactose C-1 α or β position did not impair transport. In fact, the hydrophobic groups increased the binding affinity but decreased transport rates compared with galactose. Binding and transport characteristics of deoxygalactosides from either side of the membrane showed that the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site interact differently with galactose. Compared with galactose, the IC50 values for 2-deoxy- and 6-deoxygalactose at the cytoplasmic binding site were increased 150- and 20-fold, respectively, whereas they were the same at the extracellular binding site. From these and other experiments, we conclude that the binding sites and translocation pathway of LacS are spacious along the C-1 to C-4 axis of the galactose moiety and are restricted along the C-2 to C-6 axis. The differences in affinity at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site ensure that the transport via LacS is highly asymmetrical for the two opposing directions of translocation.

Knol J. van der Does C. Henderson P.J.F. Liang W-J. Leblanc G. Pourcher T. Mus-Veteau I. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Most members of the GPH family have a structural fold that is composed of 12 transmembrane segments. LacS and some other members differ from these proteins by having an additional carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of about 180 amino acids (2Poolman B. Royer T.J. Mainzer S.E. Schmidt B.F. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 244-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cytoplasmic domain is homologous to IIA proteins/domains of various phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase systems, and its phosphorylation state influences the transport activity (3Poolman B. Knol J. Mollet B. Nieuwenhuis B. Sulter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 1M. G. W. Gunnewijk and B. Poolman, manuscript in preparation. 1M. G. W. Gunnewijk and B. Poolman, manuscript in preparation. In S. thermophilus lactose is taken up via the lactose transport system, and intracellularly the disaccharide is hydrolyzed into glucose and galactose by the action of β-galactosidase. The glucose moiety is metabolized, and the galactose moiety is excreted into the medium by action of the LacS carrier. The resulting reaction catalyzed by LacS is a lactose/galactose exchange, which is driven by the concentration gradients of both sugars across the membrane (5Foucaud C. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LacS protein also catalyzes a galactoside/H+ symport, but this transport reaction is one to two orders of magnitude slower than the exchange reaction and therefore less relevant in vivo. Any transport protein catalyzing an exchange or a proton symport reaction must oscillate between a minimum of two conformations, that is one in which the binding site faces toward the outside and one where the binding site faces toward the inside of the cell. A priori, one would expect that sugar binds with a higher affinity to the extracellular than to the cytoplasmic binding site; the latter is the site from where the sugar taken up has to be released. However, this is not necessarily true for a system like LacS; where following release of lactose, galactose is bound to the cytoplasmic binding site and subsequently released from the extracellular binding site. Surprisingly, little is known about the interactions of a sugar with the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of any (sugar) transport system. Ideally, one would like to have high resolution structural information of the transport protein to define the substrate binding site as there is for sugar-binding proteins and sugar binding toxins (6Chaudhuri B.N.

In these proteins sugar binding is accomplished by (i) extensive hydrogen bonding to which ordered water molecules participate and (ii) hydrophobic interactions with aromatic residues, which in some cases tightly stack the sugar ring between two or more aromatic residues. As no such information is available for sugar transport systems, an alternative approach was sought to dissect the structural requirements for substrate binding by LacS.

Solubilization, purification using nickel affinity chromatography, and reconstitution of LacS into Triton X-100-doped liposomes yielding proteoliposomes in which the LacS to lipid ratio is 1:100 on a weight to weight basis were performed as described previously (20Knol J.

All transport assays were carried out at 30 °C. Proteoliposomes in KPM buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgSO4) plus 10 mm lactose were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed slowly at room temperature. After extrusion through a 400-nm filter, the proteoliposomes were centrifuged (20 min at 280,000 ×g, 15 °C) and resuspended to about 1 mg/ml LacS and correspondingly 100 mg/ml lipid. To determine the apparent affinity constant for lactose at the cytoplasmic binding site (facing the outside of the proteoliposomes), aliquots of 1 μl of proteoliposome suspension were diluted into 200 μl of KPM containing different concentrations of [14C]lactose. The uptake of [14C]lactose was stopped at different time intervals by dilution of the sample with 2 ml of ice-cold 0.1 M LiCl and rapid filtering on 0.45-μm cellulose nitrate filters (Schleicher & Schuell). To calculate the actual external lactose concentration, we accounted for the lactose brought into the external buffer upon the addition of the proteoliposome suspension. IC50 values were determined by measuring the uptake of [14C]lactose present at 50 μm (approximately 0.2 times the Km[app] at the cytoplasmic binding site) in the presence of at least six different concentrations of competing sugars. The proteoliposomes were preloaded with 10 mm lactose (approximately two times the Km[app] at the extracellular binding site). Proteoliposomes were prepared for the uptake experiments as described for the counterflow assay. The apparent affinity constant for lactose at the extracellular binding site (facing the interior of the proteoliposomes) was determined using proteoliposomes that were preloaded with different concentrations of lactose and subsequently equilibrated for 2 h with trace amounts of [14C]lactose. At time point zero, 1 μl of proteoliposome suspension was diluted into 1 ml of KPM without (efflux) or with (exchange) 1 mm lactose (approximately four times the Km[app] at the cytoplasmic binding site), and the exit of lactose was stopped at different time points as described above. IC50 values at the extracellular binding site were measured using proteoliposomes that were preloaded with 1 mm of [14C]lactose (approximately 0.2 times the Km[app] at the extracellular binding site) plus at least six different concentrations of inhibitor. The reaction was started by dilution of the proteoliposomes into 1 ml of KPM plus 0.5 mm lactose (approximately two times the Km[app] at the cytoplasmic binding site). The exit of [14C]lactose was stopped at different time points as described above. To determine whether or not galactose analogs accelerate the exit of [14C]lactose and are thus transported, proteoliposomes were preloaded with 2.5 mm [14C]lactose and diluted 200-fold into KPM with 5 mm of the galactose analog. Transport rates were compared with those of efflux transport, where proteoliposomes were diluted into buffer without galactose analog. All data were corrected for background binding of [14C]lactose to the membranes and filters by subtracting the amount of label at time point zero from the counterflow data and by subtracting the amount of label at infinite time point from the exchange and efflux data. The amount of [14C]lactose retained inside the proteoliposomes after complete equilibration of [14C]lactose-preloaded proteoliposomes with external buffer is not significant compared with the background binding and was thus not corrected for. The uptake of [14C]lactose in the counterflow reaction was linear in time for at least the first 16 s, and the data were analyzed by linear regression. The exchange data were fitted to a function describing an exponential decay, Yt=Aexp−BtEquation 1 where Y (in nmol) is the amount of lactose inside the proteoliposomes at time point t, and A (in nmol) is the amount of lactose inside the proteoliposomes at time point zero.B is the decay constant of the reaction. A was calculated by multiplying the initial sugar concentration (in mm) with the specific internal volume of the proteoliposomes. Initial rates were calculated from the amount of lactose inside the proteoliposomes at time point zero (A) multiplied with the decay constant (B). The specific internal volume of the [14C]lactose preloaded proteoliposomes used in the exchange and efflux assays was estimated from the amount of radioactive label present inside the proteoliposomes at time point zero and the total amount of radioactive label present in the proteoliposome suspension (estimated 1.5 μl/mg lipid). The amount of radioactive label at time point zero was determined by extrapolation. IC50 values were determined from the inhibition curves that were fitted with a logistic function, V=(V100−V0)/[1+(I/IC50)]+V0Equation 2 where V 100 and V 0correspond to the rate of uptake in the absence of inhibitor and the rate of uptake at infinite inhibition, respectively; I is the concentration of inhibitor, and IC50 is the concentration at which the inhibitor inhibits the uptake 50%. Protein determinations on membrane vesicles were performed with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The concentration LacS in the elution fraction after Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid purification was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm (ε280 = 1.08 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1). As Triton X-100 absorbs at 280 nm, corrections were made for the contribution of (i) free detergent to the A 280 by subtracting theA 280 of the elution buffer and (ii) Triton X-100 molecules bound to LacS. The amount of Triton X-100 bound to LacS was estimated from theA 280/A 290 ratio of the sample and using theA 280/A 290 ratios of a Triton X-100 solution and that of LacS protein in dodecyl-maltoside. Three-dimensional molecular modeling of the substrates was done using Hyperchem Lite, Hypercube, Inc. Scientific Software. To dissect the interactions between substrates and the cytoplasmic or extracellular binding site, the LacS protein was purified and unidirectionally reconstituted. The membrane reconstitution protocol yields proteoliposomes in which the LacS protein is inserted inside-out into the membrane, implying that the extracellular binding site is at the inner surface of the proteoliposomes and the cytoplasmic binding site is facing the outside of the proteoliposomes. Transport and binding of several galactosides were monitored in three types of assays, that is counterflow, exchange, and efflux down the concentration gradient. In the counterflow and the exchange transport assays, two pools of differently labeled galactosides, one inside and one outside the proteoliposomes, equilibrate in time through carrier-mediated transport. In the counterflow assay [14C]lactose is present outside the proteoliposomes, whereas in the exchange and efflux assays [14C]lactose is present inside the proteoliposomes. In the efflux assay exit of [14C]lactose from the proteoliposomes is followed in the absence of external substrate. Uptake of [14C]lactose in the counterflow assay can initially be approximated with a linear function (Fig.1 A, inset). Eventually, the [14C]lactose redistributes until the external and internal concentrations have become equal (Fig.1 A). Inhibition of the initial rate of uptake of [14C]lactose as a consequence of the presence of a 20-fold excess of a nonlabeled sugar, e.g. galactose (Fig.1 A, inset) outside the proteoliposomes, implies that the sugar is bound and/or transported by LacS. To establish that the inhibitor is indeed transported, we used acceleration of [14C]lactose exit as criterion. Exit down the concentration gradient of [14C]lactose from proteoliposomes is more than 10 times slower when sugar is absent than when saturating amounts of unlabeled lactose are present externally (Fig. 1 B). The rate of exit of [14C]lactose thus increases, compared with efflux, if a counter substrate is present externally, e.g. 1 mm fucose or 1 mmβ-PG (Fig. 1 B). From these data we conclude that fucose and β-PG are transported but, under the conditions employed, at a lower rate than lactose, which may reflect either a higherK m and/or a lower V max for these galactosides. When a sugar is bound tightly but not, or only very slowly, transported, one observes an inhibition of the rate of [14C]lactose efflux, as was observed for α-NG (Fig.1 B). In Fig.2 A the initial rates of LacS- mediated, exit of [14C]lactose from proteoliposomes preloaded with different concentrations of [14C]lactose, are plotted as a function of the internal [14C]lactose concentration. In the exchange transport assays (closed circles), the cytoplasmic binding site faces a fixed near saturating amount of unlabeled lactose (1 mm, approximately four times the Km[app] at the cytoplasmic binding site). The apparent affinity constant of lactose at the extracellular binding site, which reflect a transport constant rather than a binding constant, was 5 ± 0.5 mm. In the efflux experiment (closed squares), the cytoplasmic binding site faces maximally 50 μm lactose, present as a result of the dilution of the proteoliposomes into the buffer. The apparent affinity constant at the extracellular binding site estimated from the efflux assay was comparable to that of the exchange reaction, but the V max was more than ten times lower. Fig.2 B depicts the uptake of [14C]lactose as a function of the external lactose concentration. The proteoliposomes were preloaded with 10 mm lactose so that the extracellular binding site faces near saturating amounts of lactose (approximately two times the Km[app] at the extracellular binding site). The apparent affinity constant of lactose at the cytoplasmic binding site was determined to be 0.25 ± 0.05 mm. For several substrates IC50 values, which represent the concentration at which a solute inhibits the transport rate of [14C]lactose for 50%, were determined at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site. Inhibition of lactose uptake by the presence of external galactose is competitive as shown in theinset of Fig. 2 B; the apparentKI for galactose at the cytoplasmic binding site was 80 μm. TableI summarizes the data on the inhibition of lactose uptake (column 2) and acceleration of lactose exit (column 3) by galactosides with a variety of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups linked to the galactose C-1(α) or C-1(β). The exchange rates are depicted as percentage relative to that of galactose. The data reflect interaction of the sugars with the cytoplasmic binding site and the subsequent transport to the inside of the proteoliposomes. Overall, the experiments show that the LacS protein can accommodate large hydrophobic or hydrophilic groups at the galactose C-1, as substrates like α-ONPG, X-gal, raffinose, or methyl-3-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-β-d-galactopyranoside are transported with reasonable transport rates.Table IBinding and transport of galactose and C-1-substituted galactosidesSugar1-aLinkages and C-1 attached groups are depicted for convenience; for full names see “Materials and Methods.”Inhibition of [14C]lactose uptake1-bInhibition of the initial rate of [14C]lactose uptake was measured in the presence of a 20-fold excess of the depicted sugar over [14C]lactose.

Open table in a new tab Large hydrophobic groups attached to the C-1 position of galactose yielded IC50 values for the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site that were much lower than that of galactose (Table II). The sugars, however, are transported with lower rates than galactose, and in the case of α-NG a significant inhibition of the efflux was even observed (Fig.1 B). IC50 values at the extracellular binding site were only determined for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) as α-NG and α-ONPG readily diffuse out of the proteoliposomes, which would have led to an overestimation. The IC50 values for the hydrophobic galactosides are possibly somewhat influenced by the fact that these solutes partition to some extent in the membrane. The phenomenon that hydrophobic groups increase binding affinity but decrease transport rates is also clear from Table I. Here, the hydrophobic galactosides that are transported with intermediate transport rates (β-PG and α-ONPG) show equal or stronger inhibition of [14C]lactose uptake than galactose. The hydrophilic galactosides that are transported with intermediate transport rates (methyl-3-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and raffinose) show only moderate inhibition of [14C]lactose uptake.Table IITransport rates and IC 50 values for galactose and galactosides with C-1 hydrophobic substitutions at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of LacSSugar2-aFor full names see “Materials and Methods.”IC50ext 2-bIC50ext, reflecting the extracellular binding site, was determined by measuring the exit of [14C]lactose from proteoliposomes at variable internal concentrations of inhibitor.

Open table in a new tab From the data above it is clear that the galactose moiety of lactose is the critical determinant of LacS specificity and that no significant role of the C-1-OH is to be expected. d-galactose is distinct from other d-aldohexoses by the spatial orientation of the C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-6 hydroxyl groups to the pyranose ring structure. The spatial orientation of these hydroxyl groups is therefore expected to be important for substrate recognition. The C-2, C-3, and C-4 epimers of d-galactose (d-talose,d-gulose, and d-glucose) and galactosides with methoxy substitutions of the C-2 or C-6 hydroxyl impair the interaction with the cytoplasmic binding site (TableIII), as no significant inhibition of [14C]lactose uptake is observed in the presence of these substrates. 4-O-Methyl-lactose, 2-deoxygalactose, and 6-deoxygalactose are bound and transported, albeit with lower transport rates.Table IIIThe importance of the C-2-OH eq, C-3-OH eq, C-4-OH ax, and C-6-OH for substrate recognitionSugarPresence and spatial orientation of hydroxyl or methoxy groups3-aDifferences compared to galactose are indicated in bold.Inhibition of [14C]lactose uptake3-bSee Footnote c in Table I.Rate of heterologous exchange3-cSee Footnote d in Table I.C-2C-3C-4C-6%%GalactoseOHeqOHeqOHaxOH 90–95100Talose OHaxOHeqOHaxOHn.s.3-dn.s., not significant.n.s.2-DeoxygalactoseOHeqOHaxOH68 ± 5 28Methyl-2-O-lactose3-e4-O-(2-O-Methyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl)-d-glucopyranoside, the presence and spatial orientation of the hydroxyl and methoxy groups on the galactose moiety are indicated.

Open table in a new tab IC50 values at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site were determined for galactosides that lack a hydroxyl group (Table IV). Compared with galactose the IC50 value at the cytoplasmic binding site is about 150-fold higher for 2-deoxygalactose and about 20-fold higher for 6-deoxygalactose. The IC50 values at the extracellular binding site, on the other hand, are about the same for galactose, 2-deoxygalactose, and 6-deoxygalactose. The C-2 and C-6 hydroxyl groups are thus important for binding at the cytoplasmic binding site but not for the interaction with the extracellular binding site. Substitution of the C-4 hydroxyl group for a methoxy group did not impair the interaction with either binding site, as concluded from a comparison of the IC50 values for lactose and methyl-4-O-lactose (Table IV).Table IVIC 50 values at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of LacS for sugars lacking the C-2, C-4, or C-6 hydroxyl groupSugarIC50ext 4-aSee Footnote b in Table II.IC50cyt 4-bSee Footnote c in Table II.IC50ext/IC50extgalactoseIC50cyt/IC50cytgalactosemmmmGalactose1 (±0.5)0.08 (±0.02)112-Deoxygalactose0.5 (±0.1)12 (±1.5)0.3–1.2105–2256-Deoxygalactose1 (±0.5)1.5 (±0.5)0.3–310–33IC50ext/IC50extlactoseIC50cyt/IC50cytlactoseLactose4 (±0.5)0.29 (±0.05)11Methyl-4-O-lactose4-cMethyl-4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranoside.6.5 (±1.5)0.15 (±0.05)0.9–2.20.3–0.74-a See Footnote b in Table II.4-b See Footnote c in Table II.4-c Methyl-4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Open table in a new tab To dissect the interactions between substrates and the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of LacS, we made use of purified and unidirectionally reconstituted LacS and measured the transport and binding by LacS of a range of galactosides. We show that the LacS protein is specific for the galactose moiety and not for the galactose C-1 attached groups, e.g. the glucose moiety in the case of lactose (Table I and III). It is interesting to note that glucose, the sugar moiety of lactose that serves as a carbon and an energy source inS. thermophilus, is not recognized at the binding site. The IC50 values for lactose at both binding sites are even higher than for galactose (Table IV). The observations that the affinity for galactose (and lactose) at the cytoplasmic binding site is 20-fold higher than at the extracellular binding site (Fig. 2) and that galactose is preferred over lactose at the cytoplasmic binding site (Table IV) are consistent with the view that LacS is designed to catalyze an efficient lactose/galactose exchange, rather than a one directional inward sugar flux. Galactose is distinct from other aldohexoses by the spatial orientation of the hydroxyl and hydrogen groups on the pyranose ring, which is expected to play a role in the recognition of the substrate by the protein. Specificity of the LacS protein for galactose can be based upon the formation of hydrogen bonds between the C-2, C-3, C-4, and/or C-6 hydroxyl groups and specific groups in the binding site but could also be merely based upon the ability of a sugar to fit into the binding site. The latter possibility is suggested by the experiments on the interaction of LacS with the C-2 and C-6 position of galactose. 2-Deoxygalactose and 6-deoxygalactose are bound and transported by LacS with reasonable rates, whereas the C-2-epimer of galactose (talose), methyl-2-O-lactose, and methyl-6-O-galactose are not (Table III). The impaired interaction of the binding site with talose, methyl-2-O-lactose, and methyl-6-O-galactose is therefore not caused by the lack of an essential hydrogen bond but rather by an impaired fit into the binding site. The hydroxyl group at the galactose C-1 also does not form a hydrogen bond that contributes to the specificity, as C-1-substituted galactosides that are not able to form a hydrogen bond are transported (Table I). The lack of specificity for the α- or β-anomer of galactose was also shown by cross-polarization magic-angle spinning NMR (24Spooner P.J.R. Veenhoff L.M. Watts A. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9634-9639Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although hydrogen bonding with the galactose C-1, C-2, and C-6 hydroxyl groups is not essential for the specificity of LacS for galactose, these interactions can contribute to the affinity for galactose binding. Indeed, 2-deoxygalactose, 6-deoxygalactose, and for instance, lactose have larger IC50 values than galactose (Table IV). At the galactose C-4 position the binding site discriminates against the C-4 epimer of galactose (glucose), whereas 4-O-methyl-lactose with a methoxy group substituting the C-4 hydroxyl is as good a substrate as lactose (Table III). We cannot exclude the possibility that the C-4 hydroxyl is involved in accepting a hydrogen bond from the protein and thereby contributes to the specificity or affinity of substrate binding, because the C-4 methoxy groups may do so as well. The binding site also discriminates against the C-3 epimer of galactose, gulose (Table III). The importance of this position in sugar recognition by LacS could not be determined because galactosides modified at the C-3 position were not available. Substrate selection based upon the ability of a sugar to fit into the binding site, rather than the ability to form specific H-bonds, was also suggested for GalP, as none of the hydroxyl groups seemed to be essential for transport (13Walmsley A.R. Martin G.E.M. Henderson P.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17009-17019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar conclusion can be drawn from the crystal structure of the allose-binding protein (6Chaudhuri B.N. Ko J. Park C. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which shows that the sugar ring is stacked between two parallel aromatic rings and a third perpendicular ring. As a result, binding of any hexose epimer other than the natural substrate d-allose and two deoxyalloses (C-3 and C-6) is sterically blocked. Similar to the interaction of 2-deoxygalactose and 6-deoxygalactose with LacS, the two deoxyalloses are expected to bind to the allose-binding protein with reduced affinity because of loss of a hydrogen bond. The above suggested substrate selection mechanism based on the ability of a sugar to fit into the binding site might thus reflect the fact that the spatial orientation of the hydroxyl groups determine which portion of the galactose molecule can participate in hydrophobic interactions with aromatic groups in the binding site of LacS. In its normal conformation, the hydrogen atoms at C-3, C-4, C-5, and C-6 of galactose can be considered to form a hydrophobic plane as illustrated in Fig. 3 A. The hydrophobic surface incorporating these hydrogen atoms would be a candidate for interaction with aromatic residues in the binding site. In contrast, bound [1-13C]d-galactose observed with cross-polarization magic-angle spinning NMR showed no significant difference in chemical shift compared with galactose in free solution, which is indicative of a comparable chemical environment (24Spooner P.J.R. Veenhoff L.M. Watts A. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9634-9639Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with C-1 being remote from the hydrophobic surface, as viewed in Fig. 3 A, and existing in a more polar or well hydrated region of the binding site. We showed that galactosides with large hydrophobic or hydrophilic groups at the galactose C-1(α) or C-1(β) position, e.g.ONPG, X-gal, raffinose, or methyl-3-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, are transported with reasonable transport rates (Table I). Also at the C-4 position some tolerance for substitutions was observed as methyl-4-O-lactose is transported as well as lactose (TablesIII and IV). The binding site is apparently spacious in the areas surrounding the galactose C-4 and even more so at C-1. Galactosides with hydrophobic groups attached to the C-1 position have decreased IC50 values at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site compared with galactose (Table II). The transport rates, however, are lower than those of galactose. α-NG, a strong inhibitor with an IC50 value of 4 μm compared with 80 μm for galactose, even inhibits efflux of [14C]lactose from proteoliposomes (Fig. 1 B). The decreased transport can be explained thermodynamically by suggesting that the hydrophobic groups interact favorably with hydrophobic parts of the binding site, thereby decreasing the free energy of the sugar-transporter complex and thus increasing the activation energy for the reorientation of the binding sites. The most important findings of this study concern the different interactions of the hydroxyl groups on the galactose moiety of galactosides with the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site. Compared with galactose the IC50 values for 2-deoxygalactose and 6-deoxygalactose at the cytoplasmic binding site are about 150- and 20-fold increased, respectively, whereas they are unaltered at the extracellular binding site. We speculate that the C-2-OH and C-6-OH contribute highly to the affinity for galactose at the cytoplasmic binding site by forming hydrogen bonds with the protein, which does not take place when galactose is bound at the extracellular binding site (Table IV). Differences in architecture of the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site surrounding the substrate have also been reported for Glut 1 and GalP (4Barnett J.E.G. Holman G.D. Chalkley R.A. Munday K.A. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Walmsley A.R. Martin G.E.M. Henderson P.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17009-17019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases the differences do not represent differences in interactions of the binding sites with the hydroxyl groups, but rather differences in interactions with bulky substituents. In conclusion, the observations that bulky substituents are only tolerated at the galactose C-1 and the C-4 positions and that the C-2 and C-6 hydroxyl groups contribute highly to the affinity at the cytoplasmic binding site suggest that the binding site and translocation pathway are spacious along the galactose C-1 to C-4 axes and restricted along the C-2 to C-6 axes. Fig. 3 B shows the C-1 to C-4 axes and C-2 to C-6 axes in methyl-4-O-lactose. Given these interactions and the structures of the galactosides (even trisaccharides) transported, it seems reasonable to suggest that the sugars move through the protein along their galactose C-1 to C-4 axes."

SRP is a cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particle composed of six polypeptides associated with an RNA scaffold. The targeting process begins with recognition of a hydrophobic signal sequence on a nascent secretory or integral membrane polypeptide by the 54-kDa protein of SRP (SRP54) resulting in the binding of SRP to both the ribosome and nascent polypeptide as well as a concomitant slowing of translation elongation. The ribosome nascent chain complex is targeted to translocation sites at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane through an interaction with the α-subunit of the SRP receptor (SRα) (2Lauffer L. Garcia P.D. Harkins R.N. Coussens L. Ullrich A. Walter P. Nature. 1985; 318: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).

An interesting divergence between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic SRP pathways is in the membrane assembly of the receptors. In eukaryotes, SRβ, the transmembrane β-subunit of the SRP receptor, anchors SRα on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane through an interaction with the amino-terminal domain of SRα (19Young J.C. Ursini J. Legate K.R. Miller J.D. Walter P. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15650-15657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). No homologue of SRβ has been identified in the E. coli genome sequence. Furthermore, the amino-terminal domains of FtsY and SRα are highly divergent (6Bernstein H.D. Poritz M.A. Strub K. Hoben P.J. Brenner S. Walter P. Nature. 1989; 340: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 7Romisch K. Webb J. Herz J. Prehn S. Frank R. Vingron M. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1989; 340: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), suggesting that FtsY assembles on the membrane in a different manner. Because FtsY is believed to shuttle proteins to the membrane that are not efficiently inserted by the general secretory pathway and because FtsY is an essential gene in E. coli, it is likely that membrane assembly of FtsY is tightly regulated. A highly negatively charged region has been identified at the amino terminus of FtsY (amino acids 1–196) that is not found in other eukaryotic or prokaryotic homologues (20Gill D.R. Salmond G.P. Mol.

The G region is a GTP binding domain that together with the GTPase domains of SRP54, SRα, Ffh, and their homologues constitute a specific subfamily of Ras-related low molecular weight GTPases. The N region is found amino-terminal of the G region in all SRP family GTPases and has been assumed to have a role in GTPase activity (21Montoya G. Svensson C. Luirink J. Sinning I. Nature. 1997; 385: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal A region, by analogy with the membrane assembly domain of SRα, was expected to be involved in membrane assembly. Based on this supposition, the membrane assembly properties of the FtsY A region, NG region, and G region were each analyzed (22de Leeuw E. Poland D. Mol O. Sinning I. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, all three polypeptides fractionated with membranes after centrifugation, leading the authors to conclude that each independently binds to the E. coli inner membrane (22de Leeuw E. Poland D. Mol O. Sinning I. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here we used a gel filtration chromatography-based assay to unambiguously distinguish membrane bound from aggregated FtsY. Using this assay, we determined that neither the A region nor the NG region were sufficient for membrane association, but the AN region of FtsY is both necessary and sufficient for membrane assembly. Furthermore, we found specific cleavage of some membrane-bound FtsY molecules to generate a novel membrane-bound isoform of FtsY composed of only the A and N regions confirming that AN constitutes the membrane binding domain of FtsY. General chemical reagents were obtained from Fisher, Sigma, or Life Technologies, Inc. SURETM E. coli cells used for plasmid construction were purchased from Stratagene. Except where specified, restriction enzymes, other molecular biology enzymes, and reagents were from New England Biolabs or MBI Fermentas. RNA guard (an RNase inhibitor) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Construction of plasmids, sequencing, and polymerase chain reactions were performed using standard methods (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Deletion mutants and fusion proteins of FtsY are outlined in Fig. 2 and are described below. Full construction details for the plasmids are available from the authors on request. FtsY was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from E. colistrain JM109 using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CGCCCATGGCGAAAGAAA-3′ and 5′-CAGTAGATGGGGATCCTGGAA-3′. To generate the FtsY expression plasmid pMAC897, the full-length coding sequence for FtsY was inserted behind tandem SP6 and tac promotors in the plasmid pSPtac using the restriction enzymes NcoI andBamHI. In addition to tandem SP6 and tacpromotors, this plasmid contains a Shine-Dalgarno sequence to direct bacterial translation. The entire FtsY coding sequence as well as the SP6 and tacpromotor regions were excised from pMAC897 and inserted into theBglII site of the plasmid pSPMP366 (described previously (24Janiak F. Glover J.R. Leber B. Rachubinski R.A. Andrews D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). The resulting plasmid, designated pMAC988, contains the coding region of FtsY followed by a sequence encoding the passive passenger protein gPa. In this plasmid, the endogenous termination codon of FtsY is present between the two coding regions. Plasmids encoding the various FtsY deletion mutants, FtsY fused to gPa, and FtsY deletions fused to gPa were generated using the technique described in Ref. 25Hughes M.J. Andrews D.W. BioTechniques. 1996; 20 (192–196): 188Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar to delete the requisite regions from pMAC988. Plasmid pMAC1000 encodes the polypeptide FtsYdSRY1 comprising amino acids 20 to the stop codon of FtsY. This polypeptide has a small positively charged region deleted from the amino terminus of FtsY. Plasmid pMAC999 encodes the polypeptide FtsYdSRY2 comprising amino acids 59 to the stop codon of FtsY. Plasmids pMAC997, pMAC1177, pMAC1178, pMAC1176, and pMAC995 encode polypeptides F58-gPa, F96-gPa, F155-gPa, FtsYA-gPa, and FtsYAN-gPa consisting of the amino-terminal 58, 96, 155, 197, and 284 amino acids of FtsY with the gPa domain at the carboxyl terminus. Plasmid pMAC1310 encodes the polypeptide FtsYNG-gPa consisting of amino acids 198 to the final amino acid of FtsY with the gPa domain at the carboxyl terminus. Plasmids pMAC1252 and pMAC1253 encode polypeptides FtsYA and FtsYAN consisting of the amino-terminal 197 and 284 amino acids of FtsY, respectively, followed by Leu-Gln-Asp-Pro-Arg-stop codons. Polyclonal antiserum against FtsY was raised in rabbits immunized with bacterially expressed fusion protein. Plasmid pMAC1042 encodes amino acids 41 to the stop codon of FtsY fused to the carboxyl terminus of glutathioneS-transferase in the vector pMAC241, a modification of pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with an enhanced polylinker. The fusion protein was purified using a glutathione-Sepharose column. Antibodies specific to FtsY were purified from serum as described (26Bar-Peled M. Raikhel N.V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 140-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Affinity purified anti-FtsY antibody and rabbit IgG were used for immunoprecipitation of FtsYAN-gPa. The former specifically recognizes epitopes in the AN region of this polypeptide derived from FtsY, whereas the latter is bound by gPa, which contains the IgG binding region ofStaphylococcus aureus protein A (24Janiak F. Glover J.R. Leber B. Rachubinski R.A. Andrews D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Following membrane targeting, fractions eluted from the CL-2B column were diluted with 1 ml of buffer A (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100). Affinity purified IgG against FtsY (3 μl of 0.1 mg/ml) or 3 μl of buffer was added followed by a 2-h incubation at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad) was added to the fractions incubated with 3 μl of FtsY antibody. 3 μl of IgG-Sepharose were added to the other fractions. Following incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of buffer A and then 2 times with 1 ml of buffer A without Triton X-100. To release the bound protein, the washed beads were incubated in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 5 min at 80 °C, and 8 μl were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To detect FtsY by immunoblotting, 5 μl of E. coli inner membrane inverted vesicles (INVs) containing approximately 15 μg of protein were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a semidry transfer apparatus (Hoeffer Instruments). An S30 lysate was prepared from E. coli strain MRE600 (27Cammack K.A. Wade H.E. Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as described previously (28Muller M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7421-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To remove any remaining chromosomal DNA, micrococcal nuclease was added to a final concentration of 25 units/ml of lysate along with 1 mm CaCl2. The reaction was stopped after incubation for 30 min at room temperature by adding EGTA to a final concentration of 4 mm. A membrane-free S170 extract was obtained by centrifugation of 175 μl of S30/tube in the A-100/30 rotor of an Airfuge (Beckman) at 4 °C for 15 min at 28 p.s.i. (170,000 × g) and collecting the top 125 μl. Membrane-free ribosomes were isolated as described previously (29Collier D.N. Bankaitis V.A. Weiss J.B. Bassford P.J.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 273-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A typical 20-μl-coupled transcription and translation reaction contained 35 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0; 190 mmpotassium glutamate; 30 mm ammonium acetate; 2 mm DTT; 12 mm Mg(OAc)2; 40 μm each of 19 amino acids (-methionine); 2 mmATP; 0.5 mm each of CTP, UTP, and GTP; 20 mmphosphoenolpyruvate; 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; 0.1 mg/mlE. coli tRNA; 35 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000; 20 μg/ml folinic acid; 12 μCi of l-[35S]methionine; 1 μg of plasmid DNA; 6 μl of S170; and 0.2 μl of membrane-free ribosomes. Incubations were at 37 °C for 45 min. Transcripts for cell-free translations in rabbit reticulocyte lysate were generated with SP6 polymerase as described previously (30Gurevich V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. Obukhova T.A. Zozulya S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Translations performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and labeled with [35S]methionine were described previously (31Andrews D. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 960-967PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled translation products were separated by SDS-PAGE (32Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10527) Google Scholar), visualized by phosphorimaging using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 473, and quantified using the Imagequant software from Molecular Dynamics. As a starting material for isolation of INVs, crude inverted vesicles were prepared as described in Ref. 28Muller M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7421-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar. 2-ml aliquots were then loaded on a sucrose step gradient consisting of 2.02 (10 ml), 1.44 (13 ml), and 0.77 m (13 ml) sucrose steps in 50 mm triethanolamine-acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 18 h in the SW28 rotor in an Ultracentrifuge (Beckman), INVs were removed from the 0.77/1.44 m sucrose interface and diluted with 4 volumes of 50 mm triethanolamine-acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation for 2 h at 150,000 ×g av and resuspended using a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer at 20–30 A 280 units/cm path length in 50 mm triethanolamine-acetate, pH 7.5, 0.25m sucrose, and 1 mm DTT. In vitro translation reactions were terminated by chilling on ice and a post-ribosomal supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 28 p.s.i. (170,000 × g) in the A-100/30 rotor of an Airfuge (Beckman) at 4 °C for 30 min. A 20-μl aliquot of the supernatant was incubated with 1 μl of INVs or buffer for 45 min at 37 °C. To assay membrane binding by column chromatography, the mixture was loaded onto a 0.8-ml column of Sepharose CL-2B equilibrated with 35 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 190 mm potassium glutamate, 30 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 12 mm magnesium acetate in a 1-ml syringe. The column was eluted with the same buffer; fractions (2 drops each) were collected, and 8-μl samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The included and excluded volumes of CL-2B columns were calibrated as described (19Young J.C. Ursini J. Legate K.R. Miller J.D. Walter P. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15650-15657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To assay membrane binding by vesicle floatation the mixture was adjusted to 1.6 m sucrose final concentration, and 50 μl were overlaid with sucrose steps of 100 μl (1.25 msucrose) and 50 μl (0.25 m sucrose). The steps also contained 35 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 190 mmpotassium glutamate, 30 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 12 mm magnesium acetate. Following centrifugation in a TLA 100 rotor (Beckman) at 100,000 rpm for 90 min, the gradient was fractionated into 50-μl aliquots, and the pellet was solubilized in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min. 10-μl samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To determine the elution and fractionation profiles of vesicles and nonvesicle-associated proteins in both assays, purified vesicles and aliquots of membrane-free S170 lysate were subjected to assay as above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Using this approach the major proteins in both the vesicle membranes and cytosol could be followed unambiguously. Vesicles eluted in fractions 3 and 4 in the column chromatography assay and fractionated in both the second fraction from top and in the pellet in the floatation assay. Cytosol was found in fractions 5–12 in the column chromatography assay, in the bottom two 50-μl fractions, and the pellet in the floatation assay, as expected. Attempts to determine the membrane binding domain of FtsY using a simple pelleting assay similar to that used in Ref. 33Andrews D.W. Lauffer L. Walter P. Lingappa V.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 797-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar did not clearly distinguish membrane-bound FtsY from large aggregates. Greater than 50% of FtsY pelleted both in the presence and absence of membranes (data not shown). That this consisted largely or exclusively of aggregated protein was confirmed by Sepharose S200 size exclusion column chromatography. Therefore, to assay for stable membrane binding, translations of FtsY in S170 extract were incubated with or without INVs and then fractionated by gel exclusion chromatography using Sepharose CL-2B, a resin with a large enough exclusion limit to retain FtsY aggregates (Fig.1). Vesicles and vesicle-associated proteins eluted in the excluded volume (fractions 3 and 4, marked witharrowheads in Fig. 1). The included volume (fractions 5–12) contains cytosolic proteins. As expected in the absence of INVs, FtsY synthesized in S170 extract fractionated almost exclusively in the included volume of a CL-2B column (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5–12). After incubation with INVs most of the full-length FtsY still fractionated in the included volume (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5–12), likely representing FtsY molecules present as aggregates that do not assemble onto membranes. Nevertheless, a fraction of the full-length FtsY eluted in the excluded volume with membranes, in contrast to the incubations without INVs, demonstrating that some of the FtsY in S170 extracts binds to inverted vesicles (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and4, arrowheads). Although the background is increased, it is clear that when translated in S30 lysate, which contains endogenous membranes, almost half of the full-length FtsY eluted in the excluded fractions (Fig. 1 C). This increase in binding may be because of the high concentration of vesicles present in S30 lysate, as well as the elimination of the incubation time in the absence of membranes during which aggregation may occur. In addition to the band corresponding to the previously described 92-kDa migration product of full-length FtsY (34Luirink J. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), a second band migrating as a 53-kDa species was observed when FtsY was incubated with membranes. This product eluted entirely in the excluded volume (Fig.1 B, lanes 3 and 4, dots). This band is not a result of membrane-dependent alterations in translation, such as premature termination or internal initiation, because membranes are added after translation was terminated and following removal of ribosomes from the extract. Although FtsY has a predicted mass of approximately 54 kDa, it migrates on SDS-PAGE with an apparent weight of 92 kDa (34Luirink J. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The 53-kDa product could therefore represent full-length FtsY with an as yet unidentified modification removed or a proteolytically processed form of FtsY. As shown below, this band results from post-translational cleavage of FtsY between the N and G regions. After correcting for the number of methionine residues in each of these proteins, the cleaved product accounts for approximately 75% of the membrane-bound FtsY. It has previously been demonstrated that the GTPase domain located in the carboxyl-terminal two-fifths of FtsY interacts directly with theE. coli SRP particle (35Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 36Powers T. Walter P. Science. 1995; 269: 1422-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was predicted that the amino-terminal region would be involved in membrane binding. To determine which sequences in the amino-terminal region of FtsY were necessary for membrane binding, a set of plasmids was made (Fig.2) encoding FtsY molecules with deletions of the amino-terminal 19 and 57 amino acids (SRY1 and SRY2). To identify FtsY sequences sufficient to bind INVs, test sequences were fused to gPa; a protein domain previously demonstrated to have no intrinsic targeting or membrane binding activity (24Janiak F. Glover J.R. Leber B. Rachubinski R.A. Andrews D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A series of plasmids were constructed encoding the amino-terminal 58, 96, 155, 197, and 284 amino acids of FtsY as well as amino acids 198–497 of FtsY fused to gPa. The latter three constructs have regions fused to gPa that correspond to the A region, AN regions, and NG regions of FtsY, respectively. Constructs encoding only the amino-terminal 197 or 284 amino acids of FtsY were also tested. Deletion of amino acids 1–19 or 1–58 of FtsY resulted in polypeptides (FtsYdSRY1 and FtsYdSRY2, respectively) that did not bind INVs and therefore, fractionated identically by gel filtration chromatography in the presence and absence of INVs (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 1–10 with lanes 11–20). This demonstrates that the extreme amino terminus of FtsY is necessary for membrane binding. To determine how much of the amino-terminal region of FtsY was sufficient for membrane assembly, constructs containing amino-terminal segments of the A region of increasing size fused to gPa were fractionated in the presence or absence of membranes (Fig. 3 B). Surprisingly, the elution patterns for all of these molecules are similar with and without INVs (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 1–10 with11–20 for FtsY 58-gPa, FtsY 96-gPa, FtsY 155-gPa, and FtsYA-gPa). Therefore, fusions containing part or all of the A region of FtsY did not bind to INVs. A single prominent band was obtained when a construct corresponding to the AN region fused to gPa (FtsYAN-gPa) was expressed in vitro and incubated with INVs. In contrast with the A region fusions, essentially all of this translation product fractionates with membranes in the excluded volume (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–2, dots). However, this band migrated at 53 kDa rather than the 92-kDa position observed for full-length FtsYAN-gPa in the absence of membranes (Fig. 3 B, lanes 14–20). Unlike full-length FtsY where 75% of membrane-bound product was a 53-kDa species, in reactions containing FtsYAN-gPa essentially all of the membrane-bound protein migrated at 53 kDa. In the absence of membranes, the intensity of the 92-kDa band representing full-length product is greatly reduced (Fig.3 B, lanes 14-20). We attribute this to two factors. First, the product is dispersed over a larger number of fractions in the absence of membranes (at least 6 included fractionsversus 2 excluded fractions). Second and more significantly, the FtsYAN-gPa product is apparently subject to nonspecific degradation if it is not targeted to membranes (see below, Fig. 6). Consistent with this interpretation, control experiments demonstrated that the amount of FtsYAN-gPa is maximal in S170 lysate immediately after transcription-translation and declines thereafter (data not shown). Unlike FtsYAN-gPa, the FtsYNG-gPa fusion is stable in the absence of INVs yet was unable to bind to membranes in vitro (Fig.3 B, compare lanes 1–10 with11–20). Because of the altered migration of the membrane-bound form of FtsYAN-gPa, we tested unfused versions of the A and AN sequences of FtsY individually for binding to INVs (Fig. 3 C). Consistent with the behavior of the gPa fusions, the A region eluted in included fractions in the presence or absence of membranes (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 1–10 with 11–20 for FtsYA), demonstrating that the A region alone cannot bind to INVs. The AN region eluted in the excluded volume in the presence of membranes, demonstrating that this molecule bound efficiently to INVs (Fig.3 C, compare lanes 1–10 with 11–20for FtsYAN). It is clear from this data that the AN domain, but not the A domain, of FtsY is both necessary and sufficient to direct membrane assembly. Moreover, consistent with the behavior of FtsYAN-gPa, in the absence of INVs FtsYAN is degraded in lysate (Fig. 3 C,lanes 11–20). Vesicle lift assays were used to confirm these results. Control experiments demonstrated that sealed INVs migrate at the interface of the 0.25/1.25 m sucrose steps (Fig.4, lanes 2 and 7) after centrifugation (data not shown). Some INVs were also found to pellet in this assay, presumably because they are leaky. Full-length FtsY and the putative cleavage product fractionated at the 0.25/1.25m sucrose interface only when mixed with INVs (Fig. 4,top panel, compare lanes 2 and 7) confirming that they bound to membranes. Both full-length FtsY and the putative FtsY cleavage product were also observed to pellet in the presence of membranes, as expected for aggregates and molecules bound to leaky INVs (Fig. 4, top panel, compare lanes 5and 10). As above, FtsYAN-gPa was cleaved in the presence of membranes (Fig. 4,middle panel). This product fractionated at the 0.25/1.25m sucrose interface only when membranes were added to th"
https://openalex.org/W2331190019,"The proto-oncogene Frat1 was originally identified as a common site of proviral insertion in transplanted tumors of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV)-infected Emu-Pim1 transgenic mice. Contrary to most common insertion sites implicated in mouse T cell lymphomagenesis, retroviral insertional mutagenesis of Frat1 constitutes a relatively late event in M-MuLV-induced tumor development, suggesting that proviral activation of Frat1 contributes to progression of T cell lymphomas rather than their genesis. To substantiate this notion we have generated transgenic mice that overexpress Frat1 in various organs, including lymphoid tissues. Frat1 transgenic mice develop focal glomerulosclerosis and a nephrotic syndrome, but they do not exhibit an increased incidence of spontaneous lymphomas. Conversely, these mice are highly susceptible to M-MuLV-induced lymphomagenesis, and Frat1/Pim1 bitransgenic animals develop lymphomas with increased frequency compared to Pim1 transgenic littermates. These data support a role for Frat1 in tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2121399286,"Abstract We have shown that elevated expression of ribosomal protein L5 in Xenopus embryos results in the ectopic activation of 5 S rRNA genes that are normally inactive. This transcriptional stimulation mimics the effect of overexpressingtranscription factor IIIA (TFIIIA), the 5 S rRNA gene-specific transcription factor. The results support a model in which a network of nucleic acid-protein interactions involving 5 S rRNA, the 5 S rRNA gene, TFIIIA, and L5 mediates both feedback inhibition of 5 S rRNA synthesis and coupling of 5 S rRNA synthesis to accumulation of a ribosomal protein, L5. We propose that these mechanisms contribute to the homeostatic control of ribosome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2083662981,"Intraperitoneal injection of a replication-deficient adenovirus containing the HST-1 (FGF-4) gene (Adex1HST-1) increased peripheral platelet counts in mice, and also effectively prevented experimentally induced thrombocytopenia. Here, we report the therapeutic potential of Adex1HST-1 on severely injured mice after exposure to otherwise lethal irradiation. Eighteen out of 20 mice that received Adex1HST-1 prior to γ-irradiation (9 Gy) survived, while all the 20 mice with prior administration of control adenoviruses died after irradiation (P<0.0001). Hematological and histopathological analyses revealed that Adex1HST-1 acts as a potent protector against lethal irradiation, which causes injury of intestinal tract as well as myelosuppression in the bone marrow and spleen. These data demonstrate that the protective effects of administration of Adex1HST-1 against irradiation are superior to any other protective effects of cytokines against a lethal dose of irradiation, and that the pre-administration of Adex1HST-1 may be useful for lessening the side effects of currently used chemo- and radio-therapy against cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2322388472,"Autocrine TGFalpha is an important growth effector in the transformed phenotype. Growth stimulation of some colon cancer cells as well as other types of cancer cells is effected by activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Importantly, this receptor activation leads to further stimulation of TGFalpha transcription and increased peptide synthesis. However, the molecular mechanism by which TGFalpha transcription is activated is poorly understood. In this paper, we describe the localization of a cis-sequence within the TGFalpha promoter which mediates this stimulation. This region contains parallel cis-acting elements which interact to regulate both basal and EGF-induced TGFalpha expression. The well differentiated colon carcinoma cell line designated FET was employed in these studies. It produces autocrine TGFalpha but requires exogenous EGF in the medium for optimal growth. Addition of EGF to FET cells maintained in the absence of EGF resulted in a 2 - 3-fold increase of both TGF promoter activity and endogenous TGFalpha mRNA at 4 h. This addition of EGF also stimulated protein synthesis. The use of deletion constructs of the TGFalpha promoter in chimeras with chloramphenicol acetyl transferase localized EGF-responsiveness to between -247 and -201 within the TGFalpha promoter. A 25 bp sequence within this region conferred EGF-responsiveness to heterologous promoter constructs. Further use of deletion/mutation chimeric constructs revealed the presence of at least two interacting cis-elements, one binding a repressor activity and the other, an activator. Gel shift studies indicate the presence of distinct complexes representing activator and repressor binding, which are positively modulated by EGF. The type and amount of complexes formed by these proteins interact to regulate both the basal activity and EGF-responsiveness of the TGFalpha promoter. The interaction of an activator protein with an EGF-responsive repressor may serve to regulate the level of this progression-associated, transforming protein within tight limits."
https://openalex.org/W2334977574,"Complex chromosomal rearrangements (deletions, inversions, translocations) are a hallmark of human tumour cells. Yet, the generation of animal models for gross chromosomal abnormalities still presents a formidable challenge. Here, we describe a versatile procedure for chromosomal engineering that was used to generate an ES cell line with a megabase deletion encompassing the tumour suppressor gene neurofibromatosis-1 (Nf-1) on mouse chromosome 11, which is often deleted in tumours of neural crest origin. Homologous recombination into sites flanking Nf-1 was used to introduce artificial sequences (triple-helix, loxP, vector backbone) that can be employed for in vitro recovery of intervening sequences or the generation of in vivo deletions. This strategy may be developed into a scheme by which large chromosomal regions with precisely defined end points may be excised from mammalian cells and reintroduced after suitable in vitro modification."
