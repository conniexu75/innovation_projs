https://openalex.org/W1998292787,"The soil actinomycete causing formation of nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodules on roots of the woody angiosperm Comptonia peregrina (L.) Coult. (Myricaceae) has been isolated from surface-sterilized root nodules after incubation and enzyme maceration. The filamentous bacterium grows slowly in pure culture on a yeast extract medium, producing sporogenous bodies which form large numbers of ovoid spores. Reinfection of sand-grown or aeroponically grown seedlings of Comptonia was achieved repeatedly with inocula prepared from suspensions of the Comptonia isolate. The same actinomycete has been reisolated from these seedling nodules. The induced nodules are highly active in the acetylene-reduction assay, and plants grow vigorously without an exogenous supply of fixed nitrogen."

https://openalex.org/W2082725264,"In a computer simulation of branching pattern and leaf cluster in Terminalia catappa, right and left branch angles were varied, and the effective leaf surface areas were calculated. Theoretical branch angles that result in maximum effective leaf area are close to the values observed in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2062645893,"Aeolanthus biformifolius (Labiatae) from Shaba Province, Zaïre, has been shown to be a hyperaccumulator of copper. The copper content of the total plant during the rest period after the rainy season was 1.3 percent (dry weight basis) and is easily the highest copper concentration ever found in living material. This species should be classified as a ""copper flower"" because of its exclusive occurrence over mineralized ground."
https://openalex.org/W2047189085,"The adaptive advantage of epibenthic articulate brachiopods over inarticulate forms resulted from a modification of the mechanics of shell opening from an indirect hydraulic system to a direct muscular one. As a consequence, the articulate brachiopods were able to reduce the complex muscular system of the ancestral inarticulates, freeing two-thirds of the space within the shell for enlargement of the feeding apparatus. The original hydraulic mechanism of the inarticulate brachiopods most likely evolved from the hydrostatic skeleton of metameric lower invertebrates, probably polychaete-like annelids, as shown by a biomechanical analysis. The transitional stages between such annelids and inarticulate brachiopods are presented and explained as adaptive improvements in body construction."
https://openalex.org/W2029705030,"The hypothesis of Hartung, that the impact formation of lunar crater Giordano Bruno (103° east, 36° north) was observed and recorded 800 years ago, is considered in the context of data from the Luna 24 mission and laser range observations. It is concluded that (i) the event would certainly have been visible, and (ii) current determinations of the free libration in longitude in the moon's rotation are consistent with the hypothesis. Such a study cannot prove Hartung's interpretation, but it is nonetheless supportive of it."
https://openalex.org/W2048481344,"A delay in the arrival times of compressional or P waves of 0.15 to 0.2 second from deep distant earthquakes has been detected at the closest seismograph station to the 20 November 1975 earthquake at Kalapana, Hawaii (surface-wave magnitude MS = 7.2). This delay appeared approximately 3.5 years prior to the quake, and travel times returned to normal several months before it. The P-wave arrival times at other nearby stations remained constant during this period, an indication that the decreased velocity implied by the delay in travel time was associated with this normal-faulting earthquake and was confined to distances less than 20 kilometers from the epicenter."
https://openalex.org/W2077568986,Chloride and iodide ions exhibit noncompetitive inhibition of carbon dioxide hydration catalyzed by bovine carbonic anhydrase and competitive inhibition of bicarbonate dehydration. Consideration of the net velocity at equilibrium leads to a satisfactory resolution of the dilemma concerning the different concentrations of such anions required to halve the initial reaction rate for each substrate.
https://openalex.org/W1986460494,"A new three-step permethylation procedure for humic acid fractions has been developed. In the first step, carboxylic acid groups are methylated with diazomethane in dimethylformamide; in the second step, hydroxyl groups are methylated with methyl iodide and dimethyl sulfinyl carbanion in dimethylformamide; and in the third step, acidic groups hydrolyzed in the earlier steps are methylated with diazomethane. The resulting product is completely soluble in methylene chloride (a high degree of methylation has been achieved)."

https://openalex.org/W2077880235,"We used a detailed engineering-economic simulation model of residential energy use to evaluate the effects of nine different residential energy-use ""futures."" These ""futures"" are described in terms of annual and cumulative energy use from 1977 through 2000 by fuel, end use, and in aggregate. Outputs from the model also include economic information on the costs to households of fuels, equipment, and thermal improvements to new and existing structures. The major outputs from these nine cases are shown in Tables 1 and 2 and Figs. 6 and 7."
https://openalex.org/W2073481691,"A new short-term natural gas consumption model is developed, tested against American Gas Association sales data, and applied to the question of the effectiveness of conservation efforts. The results indicate that unit residential gas-heating sales per heating degree-day have remained constant in four major gas-consuming regions during the period 1974 to 1976 and that heating sales have not been affected by the recent sharp changes in price."
https://openalex.org/W2024148306,"Human settlement of the Bismarck Archipelago occurred by 6000 to 7500 years ago. Early inhabitants of New Ireland drew on widely dispersed stone sources, including obsidian from Talasea (New Britain), whereas those after about 3000 years ago used either stone from more local sources or obsidian from Lou Island (Admiralty Islands group) or Talasea. The dates and resource changes support a gradualist model of Melanesian settlement."
https://openalex.org/W2059744333,"The present and future relationship between the metallurgical development of new steels and the determination of second-phase compounds in these steels is emphasized on the basis of recent developments in the quantitative determination of these phases. Results of the application of DTA-EGA methods are presented as an example of this analytical approach, and the method used to measure the amounts of gases evolved from the reactions of second-phase compounds with O(2) is described in detail. The DTA-EGA method has also revealed phases that had not been found earlier in steels. Smaller amounts of second-phase compounds can be more accurately determined by this method than by any other procedure. Examples are cited for the reaction of O(2), H(2), steam, and NH(3) with second-phase compounds in the isolated residue, and the use of these reactions for the determination of second phases is discussed. A disadvantage of the DTA-EGA method is that it is dependent on the quantitative chemical separation of the second phase from the matrix steel by one of several methods. The relative merits of isolating second-phase compounds by electrochemical dissolution, by dissolution in halogen and alcohols or aliphatic esters, and by use of dilute acids are discussed in terms of their effect on the DTA-EGA determination."
