https://openalex.org/W2883628966,"Ageing is a major risk factor for many neurological pathologies, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Unlike other tissues, the parenchyma of the central nervous system (CNS) lacks lymphatic vasculature and waste products are removed partly through a paravascular route. (Re)discovery and characterization of meningeal lymphatic vessels has prompted an assessment of their role in waste clearance from the CNS. Here we show that meningeal lymphatic vessels drain macromolecules from the CNS (cerebrospinal and interstitial fluids) into the cervical lymph nodes in mice. Impairment of meningeal lymphatic function slows paravascular influx of macromolecules into the brain and efflux of macromolecules from the interstitial fluid, and induces cognitive impairment in mice. Treatment of aged mice with vascular endothelial growth factor C enhances meningeal lymphatic drainage of macromolecules from the cerebrospinal fluid, improving brain perfusion and learning and memory performance. Disruption of meningeal lymphatic vessels in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease promotes amyloid-β deposition in the meninges, which resembles human meningeal pathology, and aggravates parenchymal amyloid-β accumulation. Meningeal lymphatic dysfunction may be an aggravating factor in Alzheimer's disease pathology and in age-associated cognitive decline. Thus, augmentation of meningeal lymphatic function might be a promising therapeutic target for preventing or delaying age-associated neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2884912010,"Dysregulated NLRP3 inflammasome activity results in uncontrolled inflammation, which underlies many chronic diseases. Although mitochondrial damage is needed for the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, it is unclear how macrophages are able to respond to structurally diverse inflammasome-activating stimuli. Here we show that the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), induced after the engagement of Toll-like receptors, is crucial for NLRP3 signalling. Toll-like receptors signal via the MyD88 and TRIF adaptors to trigger IRF1-dependent transcription of CMPK2, a rate-limiting enzyme that supplies deoxyribonucleotides for mtDNA synthesis. CMPK2-dependent mtDNA synthesis is necessary for the production of oxidized mtDNA fragments after exposure to NLRP3 activators. Cytosolic oxidized mtDNA associates with the NLRP3 inflammasome complex and is required for its activation. The dependence on CMPK2 catalytic activity provides opportunities for more effective control of NLRP3 inflammasome-associated diseases. New mitochondrial DNA synthesis links the priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome."
https://openalex.org/W2883018577,"Mitochondria are descendants of endosymbiotic bacteria and retain essential prokaryotic features such as a compact circular genome. Consequently, in mammals, mitochondrial DNA is subjected to bidirectional transcription that generates overlapping transcripts, which are capable of forming long double-stranded RNA structures1,2. However, to our knowledge, mitochondrial double-stranded RNA has not been previously characterized in vivo. Here we describe the presence of a highly unstable native mitochondrial double-stranded RNA species at single-cell level and identify key roles for the degradosome components mitochondrial RNA helicase SUV3 and polynucleotide phosphorylase PNPase in restricting the levels of mitochondrial double-stranded RNA. Loss of either enzyme results in massive accumulation of mitochondrial double-stranded RNA that escapes into the cytoplasm in a PNPase-dependent manner. This process engages an MDA5-driven antiviral signalling pathway that triggers a type I interferon response. Consistent with these data, patients carrying hypomorphic mutations in the gene PNPT1, which encodes PNPase, display mitochondrial double-stranded RNA accumulation coupled with upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes and other markers of immune activation. The localization of PNPase to the mitochondrial inter-membrane space and matrix suggests that it has a dual role in preventing the formation and release of mitochondrial double-stranded RNA into the cytoplasm. This in turn prevents the activation of potent innate immune defence mechanisms that have evolved to protect vertebrates against microbial and viral attack."
https://openalex.org/W2884164644,"53BP1 governs a specialized, context-specific branch of the classical non-homologous end joining DNA double-strand break repair pathway. Mice lacking 53bp1 (also known as Trp53bp1) are immunodeficient owing to a complete loss of immunoglobulin class-switch recombination1,2, and reduced fidelity of long-range V(D)J recombination3. The 53BP1-dependent pathway is also responsible for pathological joining events at dysfunctional telomeres4, and its unrestricted activity in Brca1-deficient cellular and tumour models causes genomic instability and oncogenesis5-7. Cells that lack core non-homologous end joining proteins are profoundly radiosensitive8, unlike 53BP1-deficient cells9,10, which suggests that 53BP1 and its co-factors act on specific DNA substrates. Here we show that 53BP1 cooperates with its downstream effector protein REV7 to promote non-homologous end joining during class-switch recombination, but REV7 is not required for 53BP1-dependent V(D)J recombination. We identify shieldin-a four-subunit putative single-stranded DNA-binding complex comprising REV7, c20orf196 (SHLD1), FAM35A (SHLD2) and FLJ26957 (SHLD3)-as the factor that explains this specificity. Shieldin is essential for REV7-dependent DNA end-protection and non-homologous end joining during class-switch recombination, and supports toxic non-homologous end joining in Brca1-deficient cells, yet is dispensable for REV7-dependent interstrand cross-link repair. The 53BP1 pathway therefore comprises distinct double-strand break repair activities within chromatin and single-stranded DNA compartments, which explains both the immunological differences between 53bp1- and Rev7- deficient mice and the context specificity of the pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2767445834,Electron spins hold great promise for quantum computation due to their long coherence times. An approach to realize interactions between distant spin-qubits is to use photons as carriers of quantum information. We demonstrate strong coupling between single microwave photons in a NbTiN high impedance cavity and a three-electron spin-qubit in a GaAs triple quantum dot. We resolve the vacuum Rabi mode splitting with a coupling strength of $g/2\pi\simeq31$ MHz and a qubit decoherence of $\gamma_2/2\pi\simeq 20$ MHz. We can tune the decoherence electrostatically and obtain a minimal $\gamma_2/2\pi\simeq 10$ MHz for $g/2\pi\simeq 23$ MHz. The dependence of the qubit-photon coupling strength on the tunable electric dipole moment of the qubit is measured directly using the ac Stark effect. Our demonstration of strong spin-photon interaction is an important step towards coherent long-distance coupling of spin-qubits.
https://openalex.org/W2884521265,"Regeneration of myelin is mediated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells-an abundant stem cell population in the central nervous system (CNS) and the principal source of new myelinating oligodendrocytes. Loss of myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the CNS underlies a number of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis and diverse genetic diseases1-3. High-throughput chemical screening approaches have been used to identify small molecules that stimulate the formation of oligodendrocytes from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and functionally enhance remyelination in vivo4-10. Here we show that a wide range of these pro-myelinating small molecules function not through their canonical targets but by directly inhibiting CYP51, TM7SF2, or EBP, a narrow range of enzymes within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Subsequent accumulation of the 8,9-unsaturated sterol substrates of these enzymes is a key mechanistic node that promotes oligodendrocyte formation, as 8,9-unsaturated sterols are effective when supplied to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in purified form whereas analogous sterols that lack this structural feature have no effect. Collectively, our results define a unifying sterol-based mechanism of action for most known small-molecule enhancers of oligodendrocyte formation and highlight specific targets to propel the development of optimal remyelinating therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4211121597,"Low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to osteoporosis, and is a risk factor for bone fractures, including stress fractures. Using data from UK Biobank, a genome-wide association study identified 1,362 independent SNPs that clustered into 899 loci of which 613 are new. These data were used to train a genetic algorithm using 22,886 SNPs as predictors and showing a correlation with heel bone mineral density of 0.415. Combining this genetic algorithm with height, weight, age and sex resulted in a correlation with heel bone mineral density of 0.496. Individuals with low scores (2.2% of total) showed a change in BMD of -1.16 T-score units, an increase in risk for osteoporosis of 17.4 fold and an increase in risk for fracture of 1.87 fold. Genetic predictors could assist in the identification of individuals at risk for osteoporosis or fractures."
https://openalex.org/W2883766007,"Hydrogeochemical and stable isotope analyses and geochemical modeling were carried out to identify the major geochemical processes controlling the groundwater chemistry and fluoride contamination in the aquifers of the Yuncheng Basin, China, an area with complex hydrogeochemical conditions and severe fluoride contamination of the groundwater. The major findings of this case study include the following: 1) Cation exchange and salt effects are vital controls on the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater in the area by reducing the activity of Ca2+/F- in groundwater via ion complexation. Cation exchange increased the fluoride concentration by 2.7 mg/L when the Na/Ca molar ratio increased from 0.24 to 9.0, while the salt effect led to a ca. 5–10% increase in complex F- in groundwater due to the further dissolution of fluoride-bearing minerals in the aquifers, as suggested by a model calculation. 2) Anthropogenic contamination from pesticide and fertilizer use and industrial waste discharge is also a main source of fluoride in the groundwater. 3) Evaporation and ion effects favor the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater by encouraging the removal of Ca via precipitation. 4) The desorption of fluoride from mineral/organic matter surfaces is enhanced under alkaline conditions and a high HCO3 content in groundwater."
https://openalex.org/W2884764327,"Systemic inflammatory markers derived from peripheral blood cell, such as the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), have been demonstrated as prognostic markers in several types of malignancy. Here, we investigated and compared the association between systemic inflammatory markers and survival and developed a prognostic nomogram in breast cancer patients. We reviewed the clinical and pathological records of 661 patients diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma between 1993 and 2011. The NLR, dNLR, PLR and LMR in the immediate preoperative period were assessed. We analyzed the relationship between these inflammatory markers and clinicopathologic variables, disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients. A nomogram was developed to predict 3- and 5-year DSS for breast cancer. In the univariate analysis, high NLR, dNLR, PLR and low LMR were all significantly associated with poor DSS and DFS. In the multivariate analysis, only the PLR (HR 3.226, 95% CI 1.768-5.885 for DSS and HR 1.824, 95% CI 1.824-6.321 for DFS) was still identified as an independent predictor of outcomes. A subgroup analysis revealed that the PLR was the sole independent marker predicting poor DSS in patients with lymph node metastasis (HR 2.294, 95% CI 1.102-4.777) and with luminal subtype (HR 4.039, 95% CI 1.905-8.562). The proposed nomogram, which includes the PLR, shows good accuracy in predicting DSS with a concordance index of 0.82. PLR is an indicator of systemic inflammation as a part of the host immune response. As an independent prognostic factor, an elevated preoperative PLR is superior to the NLR, dNLR, and LMR in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with breast cancer. Moreover, the nomogram incorporating the PLR could accurately predict individualized survival probability in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2883878702,"ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters are proteins that actively mediate the transport of a wide range of molecules, such as organic acids, metal ions, phytohormones and secondary metabolites. Therefore, ABC transporters must play indispensable roles in growth and development of tomato, including fruit development. Most ABC transporters have transmembrane domains (TMDs) and belong to the ABC protein family, which includes not only ABC transporters but also soluble ABC proteins lacking TMDs. In this study, we performed a genome-wide identification and expression analysis of genes encoding ABC proteins in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), which is a valuable horticultural crop and a model plant for studying fleshy fruits. In the tomato genome, a total of 154 genes putatively encoding ABC transporters, including 9 ABCAs, 29 ABCBs, 26 ABCCs, 2 ABCDs, 2 ABCEs, 6 ABCFs, 70 ABCGs and 10 ABCIs, were identified. Gene expression data from the eFP Browser and reverse transcription-semi-quantitative PCR analysis revealed their tissue-specific and development-specific expression profiles. This work suggests physiological roles of ABC transporters in tomato and provides fundamental information for future studies of ABC transporters not only in tomato but also in other Solanaceae species."
https://openalex.org/W2884414473,"Inflammation plays a key role in the progression of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Here, we examined the effects of astaxanthin (ATX) on the inflammatory response and secondary damage after SAH and the underlying mechanisms of action. In vivo, a prechiasmatic cistern injection model was established in rats and mice. In addition, neuron-microglia cocultures were exposed to oxyhemoglobin to mimic SAH in vitro. Western blotting revealed that protein expression of TLR4 was markedly increased in microglia at 24 h after SAH, with consequent increases in the downstream molecules myeloid differentiation factor 88 and NF-кB. Treatment with ATX significantly inhibited the TLR4 activation, increased sirtuin 1 expression, and inhibited the subsequent inflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro. ATX also significantly decreased high-mobility group box 1 nuclear translocation and secretion in neurons, an effect that was reversed by the sirtuin 1-specific inhibitor sirtinol. ATX administered 4 h after SAH ameliorated cerebral inflammation, brain edema, and neuronal death and improved neurologic function. ATX reduced neuronal death but did not improve neurologic function in TLR4 knockout mice. These results suggest that ATX reduces the proinflammatory response and secondary brain injury after SAH, primarily by increasing sirtuin 1 levels and inhibiting the TLR4 signaling pathway.-Zhang, X., Lu, Y., Wu, Q., Dai, H., Li, W., Lv, S., Zhou, X., Zhang, X., Hang, C., Wang, J. Astaxanthin mitigates subarachnoid hemorrhage injury primarily by increasing sirtuin 1 and inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2883957011,"Background Canine transmitted rabies kills an estimated 59,000 people annually, despite proven methods for elimination through mass dog vaccination. Challenges in directing and monitoring numerous remote vaccination teams across large geographic areas remain a significant barrier to the up-scaling of focal vaccination programmes to sub-national and national level. Smartphone technology (mHealth) is increasingly being used to enhance the coordination and efficiency of public health initiatives in developing countries, however examples of successful scaling beyond pilot implementation are rare. This study describes a smartphone app and website platform, “Mission Rabies App”, used to co-ordinate rabies control activities at project sites in four continents to vaccinate over one million dogs. Methods Mission Rabies App made it possible to not only gather relevant campaign data from the field, but also to direct vaccination teams systematically in near real-time. The display of user-allocated boundaries on Google maps within data collection forms enabled a project manager to define each team’s region of work, assess their output and assign subsequent areas to progressively vaccinate across a geographic area. This ability to monitor work and react to a rapidly changing situation has the potential to improve efficiency and coverage achieved, compared to regular project management structures, as well as enhancing capacity for data review and analysis from remote areas. The ability to plot the location of every vaccine administered facilitated engagement with stakeholders through transparent reporting, and has the potential to motivate politicians to support such activities. Results Since the system launched in September 2014, over 1.5 million data entries have been made to record dog vaccinations, rabies education classes and field surveys in 16 countries. Use of the system has increased year-on-year with adoption for mass dog vaccination campaigns at the India state level in Goa and national level in Haiti. Conclusions Innovative approaches to rapidly scale mass dog vaccination programmes in a sustained and systematic fashion are urgently needed to achieve the WHO, OIE and FAO goal to eliminate canine-transmitted human deaths by 2030. The Mission Rabies App is an mHealth innovation which greatly reduces the logistical and managerial barriers to implementing large scale rabies control activities. Free access to the platform aims to support pilot campaigns to better structure and report on proof-of-concept initiatives, clearly presenting outcomes and opportunities for expansion. The functionalities of the Mission Rabies App may also be beneficial to other infectious disease interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2884668708,"A wealth of knowledge concerning relations between genes and its associated diseases is present in biomedical literature. Mining these biological associations from literature can provide immense support to research ranging from drug-targetable pathways to biomarker discovery. However, time and cost of manual curation heavily slows it down. In this current scenario one of the crucial technologies is biomedical text mining, and relation extraction shows the promising result to explore the research of genes associated with diseases. By developing automatic extraction of gene-disease associations from the literature using joint ensemble learning we addressed this problem from a text mining perspective. In the proposed work, we employ a supervised machine learning approach in which a rich feature set covering conceptual, syntax and semantic properties jointly learned with word embedding are trained using ensemble support vector machine for extracting gene-disease relations from four gold standard corpora. Upon evaluating the machine learning approach shows promised results of 85.34%, 83.93%,87.39% and 85.57% of F-measure on EUADR, GAD, CoMAGC and PolySearch corpora respectively. We strongly believe that the presented novel approach combining rich syntax and semantic feature set with domain-specific word embedding through ensemble support vector machines evaluated on four gold standard corpora can act as a new baseline for future works in gene-disease relation extraction from literature."
https://openalex.org/W2883612219,"A multivariate linear regression model was proposed to achieve short period prediction of PM2.5 (fine particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less). The main parameters for the proposed model included data on aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained through remote sensing, meteorological factors from ground monitoring (wind velocity, temperature, and relative humidity), and other gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, and O3). Beijing City was selected as a typical region for the case study. Data on the aforementioned variables for the city throughout 2015 were used to construct two regression models, which were discriminated by annual and seasonal data, respectively. The results indicated that the regression model based on annual data had (R2 = 0.766) goodness-of-fit and (R2 = 0.875) cross-validity. However, the regression models based on seasonal data for spring and winter were more effective, achieving 0.852 and 0.874 goodness-of-fit, respectively. Model uncertainties were also given, with the view of laying the foundation for further study."
https://openalex.org/W2883815288,"Breast cancer is one of the most malignant diseases in women worldwide. Serum microRNAs (miRNAs), with the characteristics of high sensitivity and specificity, have recently attracted more attentions to serve as potential biomarkers for tumor diseases. In this study, 194 breast cancer patients’ serum samples were collected before surgery and enrolled into different groups based on their diagnostic information. To search for breast cancer diagnostic biomarkers, serum miRNAs were screened by microarray in pooled samples of healthy volunteers and breast cancer patients in different clinical stages. The miRNAs were further verified in each individual patient’s serum samples in diagnostic and predictive sets. The serum level of miR-1915-3p was upregulated and miR-455-3p was downregulated significantly in breast cancer patients compared with healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the patients with infiltrating carcinoma or lymph node metastasis had a higher serum level of miR-1915-3p and lower serum level of miR-455-3p than patients with the carcinoma in situ or patients without lymph node metastasis. ROC analysis suggested that miR-1915-3p and miR-455-3p had the potential as a promising serum diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of breast cancer. miR-1915-3p was over-expressed in certain human breast cancer cells. Functional experiments in vitro showed that miR-1915-3p enhanced cell proliferative and migrational abilities. Overexpression of miR-1915-3p repressed target gene DUSP3 and activated ERK1/2. Collectively, this study provided a new insight that miR-1915-3p might play a role in the development of breast cancer and that serum miR-1915-3p and miR-455-3p could serve as diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2884519513,"The hemostatic response involves blood coagulation and platelet aggregation to stop blood loss from an injured blood vessel. The complexity of these processes make it difficult to intuit the overall hemostatic response without quantitative methods. Mathematical models aim to address this challenge but are often accompanied by numerous parameters choices and thus need to be analyzed for sensitivity to such choices. Here we use local and global sensitivity analyses to study a model of coagulation and platelet deposition under flow. To relate with clinical assays, we measured the sensitivity of three specific thrombin metrics: lag time, maximum relative rate of generation, and final concentration after 20 minutes. In addition, we varied parameters of three different classes: plasma protein levels, kinetic rate constants, and platelet characteristics. In terms of an overall ranking of the model's sensitivities, we found that the local and global methods provided similar information. Our local analysis, in agreement with previous findings, shows that varying parameters within 50-150% of baseline values, in a one-at-a-time (OAT) fashion, always leads to significant thrombin generation in 20 minutes. Our global analysis gave a different and novel result highlighting groups of parameters, still varying within the normal 50-150%, that produced little or no thrombin in 20 minutes. Variations in either plasma levels or platelet characteristics, using either OAT or simultaneous variations, always led to strong thrombin production and overall, relatively low output variance. Simultaneous variation in kinetics rate constants or in a subset of all three parameter classes led to the highest overall output variance, incorporating instances with little to no thrombin production. The global analysis revealed multiple parameter interactions in the lag time and final concentration leading to relatively high variance; high variance was also observed in the thrombin generation rate, but parameters attributed to that variance acted independently and additively."
https://openalex.org/W2883904237,"The toxicity of lead has been known for a long time, and no safe uptake level can be derived for humans. Consumers’ intake via food should therefore be kept as low as possible. Game meat can contain elevated levels of lead due to the use of lead ammunition for hunting. A risk assessment conducted in 2010 by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment including various consumption scenarios revealed a possible health risk for extreme consumers of game meat hunted with lead ammunition (i.e. hunters and members of hunters’ households). Babies, infants, children and women of childbearing age were identified as vulnerable group with regards to the developmental neurotoxicity of lead. It was noted, that a sound data base was required in order to refine the assessment. Therefore, the research project “Safety of game meat obtained through hunting” (LEMISI) has been conducted in Germany, with the aims of determining the concentrations of lead (as well as of copper and zinc) brought into the edible parts of game meat (roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa)) due to using either lead or non-lead hunting ammunition, whilst concurrently taking geogenic (i.e. “background”) levels of lead into account. Compared to non-lead ammunition, lead ammunition significantly increased lead concentrations in the game meat. The use of both lead and non-lead ammunition deposited copper and zinc in the edible parts of game meat, and the concentrations were in the range of those detected regularly in meat of farm animals. For the average consumer of game meat in Germany the additional uptake of lead only makes a minor contribution to the average alimentary lead exposure. However, for consumers from hunters’ households the resulting uptake of lead–due to lead ammunition—can be several times higher than the average alimentary lead exposure. Non-lead bullets in combination with suitable game meat hygienic measures are therefore recommended in order to ensure “state of the art consumer health protection”."
https://openalex.org/W2884980368,"Introduction In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) the assessment of diaphragmatic function is crucial because respiratory muscle weakness can cause respiratory failure. We aimed to noninvasively assess diaphragmatic function in DMD by measuring diaphragmatic thickness by ultrasonography, under the hypothesis that the progressive decrease of lung function is related to alterations of diaphragmatic thickness. Methods Forty-four DMD patients and thirteen healthy controls were enrolled and subdivided into three age groups. Diaphragmatic thickness was measured during quiet breathing, inspiratory capacity, maximal inspiratory pressure and expiratory pressure maneuvers. Results In DMD, absolute values of diaphragmatic thickness were significantly lower than in controls in the majority of the manoeuvers and diaphragmatic thickness significantly decreased with age at end-expiration, remaining constant at end-inspiration and during maximal inspiratory pressure maneuvers. Comparing to controls, absolute values of diaphragmatic thickness and diaphragmatic thickness variations were significantly lower (p<0.001), with the exception of quiet breathing and maximal expiratory pressure maneuvers in the youngest DMD. During maximal inspiratory pressure maneuver, variation of diaphragmatic thickness was not significantly different in the all groups, nevertheless maximal inspiratory pressure decreases with age. Conclusions The diaphragm is prone to pseudo-hypertrophy in the youngest DMD, and to progressive atrophy in middle-age and oldest DMD. Diaphragm impairment could be expressed as a dissociation between muscle drive and muscle developed force. Ultrasonography could be used as a noninvasive method to assess progressive diaphragmatic weakness."

Volunteers were randomly assigned to performe 8-weeks of IMT at 50% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), low intensity AT or combined training (CT). Before the interventions, all the volunteers went 8-weeks through a control period (without training). Measures are taken at baseline, 8-week (after control period) and 16-week (after the interventions). Primary outcomes were functional capacity (incremental shuttle walk test), MIP and lower limbs strength (Sit-to-Stand test of 30 seconds). Plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1) and 2 (sTNFR2), adiponectin, resistin and leptin, redox status parameters and HRQoL (KDQOL-SF questionnaire) were the scondary outcomes. Data analyses were performed by two-way repeated measurements ANOVA.37 hemodialysis patients aged 48.2 years old (IC95% 43.2-54.7) were randomized. Increase of MIP, functional capacity, lower limbs strength and resistin levels, and reduction of sTNFR2 levels in 16-week, compared to baseline and 8-week, were observed in all the groups (p<0.001). IMT improved functional capacity, MIP and lower limbs strength in 96.7m (IC95% 5.6-189.9), 34.5cmH2O (IC95% 22.4-46.7) and 2.2repetitions (IC95% 1.1-3.2) respectively. Increase in resistin leves and reduction in sTNFR2 leves after IMT was 0.8ng/dL (IC95% 0.5-1.1) and 0.8ng/dL (IC95% 0.3-1.3), respectively, without between-group differences. Compared to baseline and 8-week, adiponectin levels (p<0.001) and fatigue domain of the HRQoL (p<0.05) increased in 16-week only in CT.IMT, AT and CT improved functional parameters and modulated inflammatory biomarkers, in addition, IMT provoked a similar response to low intensity AT in hemodialysis patients.Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios clínicos RBR-4hv9rs."
https://openalex.org/W2884696665,"Lung cancer is the deadliest known cancer in the world, with the highest number of mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the status of hotspot regions in DDR2 and KRAS genes for the first time, as well as in TP53 gene, in lung cancer patients within the Iranian population.The mutations in exon 2 of KRAS, exon 18 of DDR2, and exons 5-6 of TP53 genes were screened in lung cancer samples, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) using PCR and sequencing techniques.Analysis of the KRAS gene showed only a G12C variation in one large cell carcinoma (LCC) patient, whereas variants were not found in adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases. The Q808H variation in the DDR2 gene was detected in one SCC sample, while no variant was seen in the ADC and LCC subtypes. Variations in the TP53 gene were seen in all NSCLC subtypes, including six ADC (13.63%), seven SCC (15.9%) and two LCC (4.54%). Forty-eight variants were found in the TP53 gene. Of these, 15 variants were found in coding regions V147A, V157F, Q167Q, D186G, H193R, T211T, F212L and P222P, 33 variants in intronic regions rs1625895 (HGVS: c.672+62A>G), rs766856111 (HGVS: c.672+6G>A) and two new variants (c.560-12A>G and c.672+86T>C).In conclusion, KRAS, DDR2, and TP53 variants were detected in 2%, 2.17% and 79.54% of all cases, respectively. The frequency of DDR2 mutation is nearly close to other studies, while KRAS and TP53 mutation frequencies are lower and higher than other populations, respectively. Three new putative pathogenic variants, for the first time, have been detected in Iranian patients with lung cancer, including Q808H in DDR2, F212L, and D186G in coding regions of TP53. In addition, we observed five novel benign variants, including Q167Q, P222P and T211T in coding sequence, and c.560-12A>G and c.672+86T>C, in intronic region of TP53. Mutations of KRAS and DDR2 were found in LCC and SCC subtypes, respectively, whereas mutations of TP53 were seen in SCC and ADC subtypes with higher frequencies and LCC subtype with lower frequency. Therefore, Iranian lung cancer patients can benefit from mutational analysis before starting the conventional treatment. A better understanding of the biology of these genes and their mutations will be critical for developing future targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2883313519,"Introduction Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prevalence is believed to be elevated in Punjab, India; however, state-wide prevalence data are not available. An understanding of HCV prevalence, risk factors and genotype distribution can be used to plan control measures in Punjab. Methods A cross-sectional, state-wide, population-based serosurvey using a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling design was conducted October 2013 to April 2014. Children aged ≥5 years and adults were eligible to participate. Demographic and risk behavior data were collected, and serologic specimens were obtained and tested for anti-HCV antibody, HCV Ribonucleic acid (RNA) on anti-HCV positive samples, and HCV genotype. Prevalence estimates and adjusted odds ratios for risk factors were calculated from weighted data and stratified by urban/rural residence. Results 5,543 individuals participated in the study with an overall weighted anti-HCV prevalence of 3.6% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 3.0%–4.2%) and chronic infection (HCV Ribonucleic acid test positive) of 2.6% (95% CI: 2.0%–3.1%). Anti-HCV was associated with being male (adjusted odds ratio 1.52; 95% CI: 1.08–2.14), living in a rural area (adjusted odds ratio 2.53; 95% CI: 1.62–3.95) and was most strongly associated with those aged 40–49 (adjusted odds ratio 40–49 vs. 19–29-year-olds 3.41; 95% CI: 1.90–6.11). Anti-HCV prevalence increased with each blood transfusion received (adjusted odds ratio 1.36; 95% CI: 1.10–1.68) and decreased with increasing education, (adjusted odds ratio 0.37 for graduate-level vs. primary school/no education; 95% CI: 0.16–0.82). Genotype 3 (58%) was most common among infected individuals. Discussion The study findings, including the overall prevalence of chronic HCV infection, associated risk factors and demographic characteristics, and genotype distribution can guide prevention and control efforts, including treatment provision. In addition to high-risk populations, efforts targeting rural areas and adults aged ≥40 would be the most effective for identifying infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2883657763,"Objectives To fully clarify the role of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase in the therapeutic response to Sorafenib in Renal Cell Carcinoma as well as the cell death mechanism associated to this kinase inhibitor, we have evaluated the implication of several Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases in Renal Cell Carcinoma-derived cell lines. Materials and methods An experimental model of Renal Cell Carcinoma-derived cell lines (ACHN and 786-O cells) was evaluated in terms of viability by MTT assay, induction of apoptosis by caspase 3/7 activity, autophagy induction by LC3 lipidation, and p62 degradation and kinase activity using phospho-targeted antibodies. Knock down of ATG5 and ERK5 was performed using lentiviral vector coding specific shRNA Results Our data discard Extracellular Regulated Kinase 1/2 and 5 as well as p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase pathways as mediators of Sorafenib toxic effect but instead indicate that the inhibitory effect is exerted through the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of Akt mediates cell death associated to Sorafenib without caspase activation, and this is consistent with the induction of autophagy, as indicated by the use of pharmacological and genetic approaches. Conclusion The present report demonstrates that Sorafenib exerts its toxic effect through the induction of autophagy in an Akt-dependent fashion without the implication of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase. Therefore, our data discard the use of inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK1/2 signalling pathway in RCC and support the use of pro-autophagic compounds, opening new therapeutic opportunities for Renal Cell Carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2883841960,"The stress hormone cortisol has been recognized as a coordinator of immune response. However, its different ability to modulate the release of inflammatory mediators in males and females has not been clarified yet. Indeed, the dissection of cortisol specific actions may be difficult due to the complex hormonal and physio-pathological individual status. Herein, the release of inflammatory mediators following increasing cortisol concentrations was investigated in an in vitro model of primary human male and female lymphomonocytes. The use of a defined cellular model to assess sex differences in inflammatory cytokine secretion could be useful to exclude the effects of divergent and fluctuating sex hormone levels occurring in vivo. Herein, the cells were challenged with cortisol concentrations resembling the plasma levels achieving in physiological and stressful conditions. The production of cytokines and other molecules involved in inflammatory process was determined. In basal conditions, male cells presented higher levels of some pro-inflammatory molecules (NF-kB and IDO-1 mRNAs, IL-6 and kynurenine) than female cells. Following cortisol exposure, the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, were increased in male cells. Conversely, in female cells IL-6 release was unchanged and IL-8 levels were decreased. Anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10, did not change in male cells and increased in female cells. Interestingly, kynurenine levels were higher in female cells than in male cells following cortisol stimulus. These results highlighted that cortisol differently affects male and female lymphomonocytes, shifting the cytokine release in favour of a pro-inflammatory pattern in male cells and an anti-inflammatory secretion profile in female cells, opening the way to study the influences of other stressful factors involved in the neurohumoral changes occurring in the response to stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2884084114,"Exact pattern matching algorithms are popular and used widely in several applications, such as molecular biology, text processing, image processing, web search engines, network intrusion detection systems and operating systems. The focus of these algorithms is to achieve time efficiency according to applications but not memory consumption. In this work, we propose a novel idea to achieve both time efficiency and memory consumption by splitting query string for searching in Corpus. For a given text, the proposed algorithm split the query pattern into two equal halves and considers the second (right) half as a query string for searching in Corpus. Once the match is found with second halves, the proposed algorithm applies brute force procedure to find remaining match by referring the location of right half. Experimental results on different S1 Dataset, namely Arabic, English, Chinese, Italian and French text databases show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing S1 Algorithm in terms of time efficiency and memory consumption as the length of the query pattern increases."
https://openalex.org/W2884112891,"People receiving treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have high rates of depression. Psychosocial support in general, and treatments for depression in particular, form an important but neglected area of patient-centred care, and a key pillar in the global End TB strategy. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a psychosocial support package for people receiving treatment for MDR-TB in Nepal.This feasibility study used a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach. We implemented the intervention package in two National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) MDR-TB treatment centres and 8 sub-centres. We screened patients monthly for depression and anxiety (cut-off ≥24 and ≥17 respectively on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist) and also for low social support (cut-off ≤3 on the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support). Those who screened positive on either screening tool received the Healthy Activity Program (HAP), which uses brief counselling based on behavioural activation theory. Other aspects of the psychosocial package were information/education materials and group interactions with other patients.We screened 135 patients, of whom 12 (9%) received HAP counselling, 115 (85%) received information materials, 80 (59%) received an education session and 49 (36%) received at least one group session. Eight group sessions were conducted in total. All aspects of the intervention package were acceptable to patients, including the screening, information, group work and counselling. Patients particularly valued having someone to talk to about their concerns and worries. We were able to successfully train individuals with no experience of psychological counselling to deliver HAP.This psychosocial support package is acceptable to patients. The information materials we developed are feasible to deliver in the current NTP. However, the structured psychological counselling (HAP), is not feasible in the current NTP due to time constraints. This requires additional investment of counsellors in TB clinics."
https://openalex.org/W2952452496,"Screening cells for their differentiation potential requires a combination of tissue culture models and imaging methods that allow for long-term tracking of the location and function of cells. Embryonic kidney re-aggregation in vitro assays have been established which allow for the monitoring of organotypic cell behaviour in re-aggregated and chimeric renal organoids. However, evaluation of cell integration is hampered by the high photonic load of standard fluorescence microscopy which poses challenges for imaging three-dimensional systems in real-time over a time course. Therefore, we employed light sheet microscopy, a technique that vastly reduces photobleaching and phototoxic effects. We have also developed a new method for culturing the re-aggregates which involves immersed culture, generating organoids which more closely reflect development in vivo. To facilitate imaging from various angles, we embedded the organoids in a freely rotatable hydrogel cylinder. Endpoint fixing and staining were performed to provide additional biomolecular information. We succeeded in imaging labelled cells within re-aggregated kidney organoids over 15 hours and tracking their fate while simultaneously monitoring the development of organotypic morphological structures. Our results show that Wt1-expressing embryonic kidney cells obtained from transgenic mice could integrate into re-aggregated chimeric kidney organoids and contribute to developing nephrons. Furthermore, the nascent proximal tubules that formed in the re-aggregated tissues using the new culture method displayed secretory function, as evidenced by their ability to secrete an organic anion mimic into the tubular lumen."
https://openalex.org/W2883236497,"The impact of senescence and pathogen infection on Aedes aegypti life-history traits remains poorly understood. This laboratory study focused on the impact of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and the age of first blood intake on blood meal and clutch sizes, and more importantly on the egg production ratio per μL of blood. Three groups of ZIKV-infected and uninfected Ae. aegypti females that received their first blood meal at 7 (young feeders), 14 (mature feeders) and 21 days old (old feeders) were monitored daily for survival and received a blood meal free of ZIKV once a week. The number of eggs laid per female were registered 3-4 days after blood feeding. Infection by ZIKV and age of feeding produced a strong negative impact on survival and oviposition success (e.g. likelihood of laying at least one egg per gonotrophic cycle). Interestingly, clutch size presented a dramatic reduction on uninfected mosquitoes, but raised from 36.5 in clutch1 to 55.1 eggs in clutch 3. Blood meal size remained stable in uninfected females, while a slight increase was observed for the infected counterparts. In uninfected Ae. aegypti, egg production was strongly affected by the age of feeding with younger females laying three times more eggs than when older. On the other hand, ZIKV-infected mosquitoes had a constant but low egg production. Overall, mosquito senescence and ZIKV infection had an impact on mosquito egg production by causing a sharp decrease in the number of eggs along the clutches for uninfected mosquitoes and a slight increase for infected mosquitoes. Despite some study limitations, our results contribute to a better understanding of the effects of mosquito aging and pathogen infection on the vectorial capacity of Ae. aegypti."
https://openalex.org/W2884150790,"Deep learning techniques, e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been explosively applied to the research in the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing. However, few research efforts have addressed semantic indexing with deep learning. The use of semantic indexing in the biomedical literature has been limited for several reasons. For instance, MEDLINE citations contain a large number of semantic labels from automatically annotated MeSH terms, and for a great deal of the literature, only the information of the title and the abstract is readily available. In this paper, we propose a Boltzmann Convolutional neural network framework (B-CNN) for biomedicine semantic indexing. In our hybrid learning framework, the CNN can adaptively deal with features of documents that have sequence relationships, and can capture context information accordingly; the Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) merges global (the entity in each document) and local information through its training with undirected connections. Additionally, we have designed a hierarchical coarse to fine style indexing structure for learning and classifying documents, and a novel feature extension approach with word sequence embedding and Wikipedia categorization. Comparative experiments were conducted for semantic indexing of biomedical abstract documents; these experiments verified the encouraged performance of our B-CNN model."
https://openalex.org/W2884283921,"Urinary incontinence is associated with enhanced spontaneous phasic contractions of the detrusor smooth muscle (DSM). Although a complete understanding of the etiology of these spontaneous contractions is not yet established, it is suggested that the spontaneously evoked action potentials (sAPs) in DSM cells initiate and modulate the contractions. In order to further our understanding of the ionic mechanisms underlying sAP generation, we present here a biophysically detailed computational model of a single DSM cell. First, we constructed mathematical models for nine ion channels found in DSM cells based on published experimental data: two voltage gated Ca2+ ion channels, an hyperpolarization-activated ion channel, two voltage-gated K+ ion channels, three Ca2+-activated K+ ion channels and a non-specific background leak ion channel. The ion channels' kinetics were characterized in terms of maximal conductances and differential equations based on voltage or calcium-dependent activation and inactivation. All ion channel models were validated by comparing the simulated currents and current-voltage relations with those reported in experimental work. Incorporating these channels, our DSM model is capable of reproducing experimentally recorded spike-type sAPs of varying configurations, ranging from sAPs displaying after-hyperpolarizations to sAPs displaying after-depolarizations. The contributions of the principal ion channels to spike generation and configuration were also investigated as a means of mimicking the effects of selected pharmacological agents on DSM cell excitability. Additionally, the features of propagation of an AP along a length of electrically continuous smooth muscle tissue were investigated. To date, a biophysically detailed computational model does not exist for DSM cells. Our model, constrained heavily by physiological data, provides a powerful tool to investigate the ionic mechanisms underlying the genesis of DSM electrical activity, which can further shed light on certain aspects of urinary bladder function and dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2883622091,"The Philippines has built an extensive decentralised network of Animal Bite Treatment Centers (ABTCs) to help bite victims receive timely rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) at little cost. This study surveyed patients in the community and at ABTCs of three provinces to assess animal bite/scratch incidence, health-seeking behaviour and PEP-related out-of pocket expenses (OOPE).During community surveys in 90 barangays (neighbourhoods), 53% of households reported at least one animal bite /scratch injury over the past 3 years, similar across urban and rural barangays. Overall bite/scratch incidences in 2016-17 were 67.3, 41.9 and 48.8 per 1,000 population per year for Nueva Vizcaya, Palawan and Tarlac respectively. Incidences were around 50% higher amongst those under 15 years of age, compared to -those older than 15. Household awareness of the nearest ABTCs was generally over 80%, but only 44.9% sought proper medical treatment and traditional remedies were still frequently used. The proportion of patients seeking PEP was not related to the distance or travel time to the nearest ABTC. For those that did not seek medical treatment, most cited a lack of awareness or insufficient funds and almost a third visited a traditional healer. No deaths from bite/scratch injuries were reported. A cohort of 1,105 patients were interviewed at six ABTCs in early 2017. OOPE varied across the ABTCs, from 5.53 USD to 37.83 USD per patient, primarily dependent on the need to pay for immunization if government supplies had run out. Overall, 78% of patients completed the recommended course, and the main reason for non-completion was a lack of time, followed by insufficient funds. Dog observation data revealed that 85% of patients were not truly exposed to rabies, and education in bite prevention might reduce provoked bites and demand for PEP. An accompanying paper details the ABTC network from the health provider's perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2884047902,"Purpose To evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of retinal and choroidal thickness measured with Swept source Optical Coherence Tomography (SS-OCT) in eyes with Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). Methods 42 DME eyes were imaged using SS-OCT standard Macular scanning protocols. Retinal and choroidal thickness were measured in the Total macular circle (TMC) and foveal central subfield (FCS) using device-integrated specific software. The coefficient of repeatability (CR) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were determined as a measure of repeatability and relative reliability within graders. Reproducibility was assessed using Bland-Altman plots and 95% limits of agreement (LoA) were determined as a measure of interobserver variability. Results Intragrader CR of retinal and choroidal thickness were 8.37 and 12.20 microns for TMC and 22.24 and 32.40 microns for FCS, and intergrader 95% LoA were 7.37–8.69 and -27.2–27.71 microns for TMC and -34.21–41.93 and -30.46–24.84 for FCS, respectively. Retinal and choroidal thickness showed very good intraobserver reliability for both TMC and FCS (ICC 0.99, LoA 0.98–0.99 in all cases). Intraobserver and interobserver variability for retinal and choroidal thickness was not significantly different for TMC (p = 0.98 and p = 0.90, p = 0.98 and p = 0.91) or FCS (p = 0.97 and p = 0.85, p = 0.78 and p = 0.73), respectively. Conclusions Retinal and choroidal thickness in DME eyes can be quantified with good reliability, repeatability and reproducibility using new OCT devices that incorporate swept source technology. The technical advantages of this technology may provide new insights in the understanding of the choroidal changes related with DME."
https://openalex.org/W2884158585,"Biomass as a renewable energy source has become increasingly prevalent in Europe to comply with greenhouse gas emission targets. As one of the most efficient perennial bioenergy crops, there is great potential in the Upper Rhine Region to explore biomass utilization of Miscanthus to confront climate change and land use demand in the future. Yet, the impacts of Miscanthus cultivation on soil quality have not been adequately explored. This study investigated the soil profiles of five- and 20-year-old Miscanthus fields (1 m depth) as well as grassland for reference in eastern France and Switzerland. The soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations and δ13C compositions of four soil layers (0-10 cm, 10-40 cm, 40-70 cm and 70-100 cm) were determined. The CO2 emission rates of the topsoil were monitored for 42 days. Our results showed that Miscanthus, in general, could increase the SOC stocks compared to grassland, but the benefits of SOC sequestration were constrained to the surface soil. Isotopically, the Miscanthus-derived SOC ranged from 69% in the top 10 cm of soil down to only 7% in the 70 cm to 100 cm layer. This result raises the risk of overestimating the total net benefits of Miscanthus cultivation, when simply using the greater SOC stocks near the surface soil to represent the SOC-depleted deep soil layers. The Miscanthus fields had greater CO2 emissions, implying that the Miscanthus fields generated greater ecosystem respiration, rather than larger net ecosystem exchanges. Compared to the grassland soils, the surface soils of the Miscanthus fields tended to have a risk of acidification while having higher concentrations of phosphorus and potassium, calling for the inclusion of soil characteristics and SOC stability when evaluating the impacts of long-term Miscanthus cultivation on both current and future land use changes."
https://openalex.org/W2883665250,"Derivatives from the Cannabis plant are the most commonly abused illegal substances in the world. The main psychoactive component found in the plant, Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), exerts its effects through the endocannabinoid system. Manipulations of this system affect some types of learning that seem to be dependent on dorsal striatum synaptic plasticity. Dendritic spines exhibit important synaptic functional attributes and a potential for plasticity, which is thought to mediate long-lasting changes in behaviour. To study the possible structural plasticity changes that prolonged THC administration might exert in the dorsal striatum, adult, male C57BL6/J mice were intraperitoneally injected with THC (10mg/kg) or vehicle for 15 days followed by a 7-day drug-free period. Using single cell intracellular injections of Lucifer Yellow, confocal microscopy, and 3D reconstruction of labelled neurons, we studied dendritic spine density and spine size in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the anterior dorsolateral striatum (aDLS) and posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS). We found that the THC treatment increased dendritic spine density in the distal part of the dendrites of MSNs in the pDMS, but no changes were found in the rest of the parameters analysed in either region studied. We also observed that dendritic spines of MSNs of pDMS presented lower volume and surface area values than MSNs of the aDLS. These results seem to indicate that THC could induce structural plasticity alterations in the circuits involving pDMS MSNs."
https://openalex.org/W2884000329,"The objective of this study was to determine the impact of manganese (Mn2+) and heme on the biofilm formation characteristics of six B. cereus food isolates and two reference strains (ATCC 10987 and ATCC 14579). The data obtained from the crystal violet assay revealed that addition of a combination of Mn2+ and heme to BHI growth medium induced B. cereus biofilm formation. However, the induction of biofilm formation was strictly strain-dependent. In all of the induced strains, the impact of Mn2+ was greater than that of heme. The impact of these two molecules on the phenotypic characteristics related to biofilm formation, such as cell density, sporulation and swarming ability, was determined in a selected food isolate (GIHE 72–5). Addition of Mn2+ and heme to BHI significantly (p < 0.05) increased the number of cells, which was correlated with the results of crystal violet assays as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analyses. In addition, induced biofilms showed higher numbers of spores and greater resistance to benzalkonium chloride. The swarming ability of B. cereus planktonic cells was increased in the presence of Mn2+ and heme in BHI. The expression levels of a number of selected genes, which are involved in mobility and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) formation in B. cereus, were positively correlated with biofilm formation in the presence of Mn2+ and heme in BHI. These results further confirming the role of these molecules in swarming mobility and making matrix components related to B. cereus biofilm formation. These data indicate that signaling molecules present in the food environment might substantially trigger B. cereus biofilm formation, which could pose a threat to the food industry."
https://openalex.org/W2883385181,"Previous studies demonstrate essential roles for the exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP 1 and 2 (Epac1 and Epac2; here collectively referred to as Epac) in the brain. In the hippocampus, Epac contributes to the control of neuronal growth and differentiation and has been implicated in memory and learning as well as in anxiety and depression. In the present study we address the hypothesis that Epac affects hippocampal cellular responses to acute restraint stress. Stress causes activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis, and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling is essential for proper feedback regulation of the stress response, both in the brain and along the HPA axis. In the hippocampus, GR expression is regulated by cAMP and the brain enriched micro RNA miR-124. Epac has been associated with miR-124 expression in hippocampal neurons, but not in regulation of GR. We report that hippocampal expression of Epac1 and Epac2 increased in response to acute stress in female wild type mice. In female mice genetically deleted for Epac, nuclear translocation of GR in response to restraint stress was significantly delayed, and moreover, miR-124 expression was decreased in these mice. Male mice lacking Epac also showed abnormalities in miR-124 expression, but the phenotype was less profound than in females. Serum corticosterone levels were slightly altered immediately after stress in both male and female mice deleted for Epac. The presented data indicate that Epac1 and Epac2 are involved in controlling cellular responses to acute stress in the mouse hippocampus and provide novel insights into the underlying transcriptional and signaling networks. Interestingly, we observe sex specific differences when Epac is deleted. As the incidence and prevalence of stress-related diseases are higher in women than in men, the Epac knockout models might serve as genetic tools to further elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying differences between male and female with regard to regulation of stress."
https://openalex.org/W2883686589,"MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that influence gene expression by binding to the 3' UTR of target mRNAs in order to repress protein synthesis. Soon after discovery, microRNA dysregulation has been associated to several pathologies. In particular, they have often been reported as differentially expressed in healthy and tumor samples. This fact suggested that microRNAs are likely to be good candidate biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and personalized medicine. With the advent of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), measuring the expression level of the whole miRNAome at once is now routine. Yet, the collaborative effort of sharing data opens to the possibility of population analyses. This context motivated us to perform an in-silico study to distill cancer-specific panels of microRNAs that can serve as biomarkers. We observed that the problem of finding biomarkers can be modeled as a two-class classification task where, given the miRNAomes of a population of healthy and cancerous samples, we want to find the subset of microRNAs that leads to the highest classification accuracy. We fulfill this task leveraging on a sensible combination of data mining tools. In particular, we used: differential evolution for candidate selection, component analysis to preserve the relationships among miRNAs, and SVM for sample classification. We identified 10 cancer-specific panels whose classification accuracy is always higher than 92%. These panels have a very little overlap suggesting that miRNAs are not only predictive of the onset of cancer, but can be used for classification purposes as well. We experimentally validated the contribution of each of the employed tools to the selection of discriminating miRNAs. Moreover, we tested the significance of each panel for the corresponding cancer type. In particular, enrichment analysis showed that the selected miRNAs are involved in oncogenesis pathways, while survival analysis proved that miRNAs can be used to evaluate cancer severity. Summarizing: results demonstrated that our method is able to produce cancer-specific panels that are promising candidates for a subsequent in vitro validation."
https://openalex.org/W2883856133,"The identification of disease-related genes and disease mechanisms is an important research goal; many studies have approached this problem by analysing genetic networks based on gene expression profiles and interaction datasets. To construct a gene network, correlations or associations among pairs of genes must be obtained. However, when gene expression data are heterogeneous with high levels of noise for samples assigned to the same condition, it is difficult to accurately determine whether a gene pair represents a significant gene-gene interaction (GGI). In order to solve this problem, we proposed a random forest-based method to classify significant GGIs from gene expression data. To train the model, we defined novel feature sets and utilised various high-confidence interactome datasets to deduce the correct answer set from known disease-specific genes. Using Alzheimer's disease data, the proposed method showed remarkable accuracy, and the GGIs established in the analysis can be used to build a meaningful genetic network that can explain the mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease."

Disclosure is important during AHI as a means to facilitate safer sex practices and notify partners, particularly as those with AHI may be better able to identify the source of their infection because of the recency of HIV acquisition. However, little is known about disclosure during AHI. We conducted 40 semi-structured interviews with Malawians diagnosed with AHI (24 men; 21 married). Most participants reported disclosing to a sexual partner within a month of diagnosis, and knew or had a strong suspicion about the source of their infection. Participants often assumed their source had knowingly infected them, contributing to anger and feeling that disclosure is futile if the source already knew their HIV status. Assisted partner notification, individual and couples counseling, and couples HIV testing may facilitate disclosure during AHI.NCT01450189."
https://openalex.org/W2884364561,"Objective Fatty infiltration of the pancreas is a dominating feature in cystic fibrosis (CF). We evaluate the association between pancreatic fat content assessed by Dixon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), pancreatic echogenicity at ultrasonography (US) and exocrine function in CF patients and healthy controls (HC). Material and methods Transabdominal US, pancreatic Dixon-MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were performed in 21 CF patients and 15 HCs. Exocrine function was assessed by endoscopic secretin test and fecal elastase. Results CF patients were grouped according to exocrine pancreatic function as subjects with normal (CFS: n = 11) or reduced (CFI: n = 10) function. Among CFI 90% (9/10) had visual hyperechogenicity. CFI also had increased echo-level values (p<0.05 vs others). All CFI (10/10) had markedly increased pancreatic fat content estimated by MRI compared to sufficient groups, p<0.001). Among CFS patients and HC, 27% (3/11) and 33% (5/15), respectively, had hyperechoic pancreas. However, all these had low pancreatic fat-content at MRI compared to CFI. In CFI, pancreatic fat content was correlated to ADC (r = -0.93, p<0.001). Conclusion Pancreas insufficient CF patients exhibit severe pancreatic fatty-infiltration at MRI and hyperechoic pancreas at US. Pancreas hyperechogenicity in pancreatic sufficient subjects does not co-exist with fatty infiltration at MRI. MRI evaluates pancreatic fatty infiltration more accurately than US and fat infiltration estimated by MRI outperforms sonographic hyper-echogenicity as a marker for exocrine pancreatic failure in CF."
https://openalex.org/W2884413344,"To compare the surgical outcomes of unilateral lateral rectus recession-medial rectus resection (RR) according to forced duction test (FDT) results with those of conventional RR in intermittent exotropia.A total of 129 patients aged 3 to 10 years with intermittent exotropia who underwent RR between 2006 and 2011 were included. The operator compared the tension of the lateral rectus (LR) between both eyes. When FDT results were asymmetric, RR was performed on the eye with more LR tension. RR was performed on the nondominant eye when FDT results were symmetric. Patients were divided into two groups; one group (n = 64) underwent RR without FDT (RR group) and the other group (n = 65) underwent RR considering FDT results (RR-FDT group). Success, recurrence, reoperation rates and cumulative probabilities of success were evaluated in both groups. Surgical outcome was considered satisfactory if the distance deviation in the primary position was between ≤ 10 PD of exophoria/tropia and ≤ 10 PD of esophoria/tropia. Recurrence was defined as an alignment of > 10 PD of exophoria/tropia, and overcorrection defined as > 10 PD of esophoria/tropia. Reoperation for recurrence was recommended for constant exotropia ≥ 14 PD at distance.The total follow-up periods were 4.4±2.3 years in the RR group, and 3.9±2.0 years in the RR-FDT group (P = .310). In the RR group, 50 patients (78.1%) were successful, 13 patients (20.3%) had recurrence, and 1 patient (1.6%) had overcorrection at 2 years after surgery. In the RR-FDT group, 58 patients (89.2%) were successful, 5 patients (7.7%) had recurrence, and 2 patients (3.1%) were overcorrected. The recurrence rate at 2 years after operation was significantly lower in the RR-FDT group (P = .045). Recurrence rates during the follow-up period were 5.6% per person-year in the RR group and 2.7% per person-year in the RR-FDT group. Reoperation for recurrence was performed on 7 patients (10.8%) in the RR-FDT group and 16 patients (25.0%) in the RR group (P = .035). Postoperative sensory outcomes were similar between both groups.The forced duction test was useful in reducing the risk of recurrence at 2 years after surgery when RR was performed on the eye with more passive tension of the LR. Intraoperative FDT may be considered to choose which eye to operate on when planning RR in intermittent exotropia."
https://openalex.org/W3022658043,"Background Data Monitoring Committees (DMCs) are essential to the good conduct of many trials. Typically they comprise a small expert group which monitors safety, efficacy, progress and early outcome data as trials recruit. DMCs can recommend protocol revisions and early stopping of a trial. As DMC meetings usually consider unblinded interim data confidentially, their deliberations are seldom exposed to research scrutiny. Although there have been some case studies from trials from mixed specialties which offer insights into some of the common issues faced by DMCs, we have, however, little empirical information about the challenges faced within specific clinical settings. Methods In-depth interviews with participants in the BRACELET Study on death and bereavement in neonatal intensive care trials produced qualitative accounts of experiences and views of a subgroup of 18 DMC members. These interviews explored views of DMC members in relation to the clinical context of neonatal intensive care and the conduct of neonatal intensive care trials. Results Interviewees felt that an understanding of both the neonatal intensive care setting and population was crucial in a DMC. They considered the neonatal intensive care research population especially vulnerable, and that outcomes that included both death and severe disability raised particular challenges rarely faced in other settings. In exploring these key outcomes they were mindful of the need to meet high scientific standards and the needs of babies in the trials and their families. DMC members discussed particular difficulties around the composite outcome of death and severe disability, especially when mortality data were available long before data on longer term disability. While statistical stopping guidance is helpful, DMC members described decisions about stopping, revising or continuing a trial being informed by a wider set of considerations and discussions than a pre-set p value. These included potentially competing needs of current trial participants and future patients, and reflections on the nature of benefit and harm. Given their cognisance of the potential impact and consequences of the decisions made by DMCs in this setting of life, death, and disability, interviewees commonly used the imagery of bravery, and described DMCs either holding or losing their nerve. Conclusions DMCs for trials in other fields may also face difficult ethical trade-offs in monitoring composite outcomes. The experience from this sample of DMC members suggest that for neonatal intensive care trials there are some very specific challenges seldom faced elsewhere. The vulnerability of the population, and the different timescales for essential data becoming available to inform decisions, presented particular challenges. We suggest that it is important to consider the challenges raised in other settings to better understand the complex work of these committees and to prepare future generations of DMC members."

Several models argue that this ‘alcohol priming effect’ is mediated by the effect of alcohol on inhibitory control. Alternatively, beliefs about how alcohol affects behavioural regulation may also underlie alcohol priming and alcohol-induced inhibitory impairments. Here two studies examine the extent to which the alcohol priming effect and inhibitory impairments are moderated by beliefs regarding the effects of alcohol on the ability to control behaviour. In study 1, following a priming drink (placebo or .5g/kg of alcohol), participants were provided with bogus feedback regarding their performance on a measure of inhibitory control (stop-signal task; SST) suggesting that they had high or average self-control. However, the bogus feedback manipulation was not successful. In study 2, before a SST, participants were exposed to a neutral or experimental message suggesting acute doses of alcohol reduce the urge to drink and consumed a priming drink and this manipulation was successful. In both studies craving was assessed throughout and a bogus taste test which measured ad libitum drinking was completed. Results suggest no effect of beliefs on craving or ad lib consumption within either study. However, within study 2, participants exposed to the experimental message displayed evidence of alcohol-induced impairments of inhibitory control, while those exposed to the neutral message did not. These findings do not suggest beliefs about the effects of alcohol moderate the alcohol priming effect but do suggest beliefs may, in part, underlie the effect of alcohol on inhibitory control."
https://openalex.org/W2883956791,"The growing seal populations of the Baltic have led to more frequent interactions with coastal fisheries. The motivation for seals to interact with fishing gear is high. It provides high densities of fish. A successful means of mitigating the conflict is the pontoon trap. Seal visits here have been frequent. Seals have access to most parts of the trap system including the middle chamber, which is an overhead environment. Concerns have been raised about seals possible entanglement in this specific part of the trap. As a means of keeping seals from entering the middle chamber, two different Seal Exclusion Devices (SEDs) were tested. A diamond mesh SED and a square mesh SED, which was rotated 45°. The aim was to compare the functionality of the different SEDs with respect to seal deterrent abilities and catch composition. The hypothesis tested were (i) that seals would not be able to enter the middle chamber, (ii) that the catch would increase and (iii) that the SED would deter larger fish from swimming into the middle chamber. Catch data and underwater film were collected. Larger salmons were caught in traps equipped with SEDs. The SEDs did not affect the number of caught fish or the total catch per soak day."
https://openalex.org/W2883160429,"One of the founding experiments in the field of Neuro-Information-Systems (NeuroIS), which aims at exploring the neural correlates of the technology acceptance model, suggests that perceived ease of use (PEoU) is associated with activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) while perceived usefulness is associated with activity in the insula, caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex. To further assess the link between DLPFC and PEoU, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was applied over bilateral DLPFC (F3 and F4) immediately before an online shopping task. Forty-two participants were divided in three stimulation groups: left anodal/right cathodal, left cathodal/right anodal and sham. No change in PEoU was observed post stimulation but participants in the left anodal/right cathodal stimulation group took longer to make a purchase compared to sham stimulation and had different visual fixation patterns over the buy buttons. This is, to our knowledge, the first use of non-invasive brain stimulation in the field of NeuroIS. Although the involvement of DLPFC in PEoU could not be confirmed, the present study suggests that non-invasive brain stimulation may be a useful research tool in NeuroIS."
https://openalex.org/W2883070642,"Background The management of localized prostate cancer is challenging because of the many therapeutic options available, none of which is generally acknowledged as superior to the others in every respect. The selection of the most appropriate treatment should therefore reflect patients’ preferences. Objective The purpose of the following study was to pilot a new approach for investigating whether urologists who had previously provided patients with therapeutic advice actually knew their patients’ importance weights concerning the relevant aspects of the treatments at issue. Method Participants were patients recently diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (n = 20), urologists (n = 10), and non-medical professionals (architects, n = 10). These last served as a control group for the urologists and were matched to them for age and gender. Patients’ importance weights were elicited by two standard methods (Direct Rating and Value Hierarchy). Each urologist was asked to estimate (with Direct Rating) his/her patient’s importance weights. The same task was performed by a corresponding architect, who never met the patient and knew only the patient’s age. Univariate and bivariate statistical analyses were performed to investigate the association between importance weights as elicited from patients and as estimated by urologists and architects, as well as to assess whether such agreement was attribute-dependent. Results Participants found both elicitation methods easy to use. The correlation between patients’ actual importance weights and urologists’ estimates was poor and comparable to that obtained between patients and architects. This result did not depend on the attribute considered, with the sole exception of the attribute “Effectiveness in curing the cancer”, which was evaluated as the most important attribute by the majority of participants. Conclusion These findings demonstrate the feasibility of the employed methodology and highlight the need to support preference-sensitive decisions in clinical practice by facilitating the elicitation of patients’ importance weights, as well as their communication to physicians."
https://openalex.org/W2883618295,"Accelerated bone loss occurs rapidly following renal transplantation due to intensive immunosuppression and persistent hyperparathyroidism. In renal transplant recipients (RTRs) due to the hyperparathyroidism the non-dominant forearm is often utilized as a peripheral measurement site for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements. The forearm is also the site of previous created distal arteriovenous fistulas (AVF). Although AVF remain patent long after successful transplantation, there are no data available concerning their impact on radial bone DXA measurements.In this cross-sectional study we performed DXA in 40 RTRs with preexisting distal AVF (RTRs-AVF) to assess areal bone mineral density (aBMD) differences between both forearms (three areas) and compared our findings to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD, n = 40), pre-emptive RTRs (RTRs-pre, n = 15) and healthy volunteers (n = 20). In addition, we assessed relevant demographic, biochemical and clinical aspects.We found a marked radial asymmetry between the forearms in RTRs with preexisting AVF. The radial aBMD at the distal AVF forearm was lower compared to the contralateral forearm, resulting in significant differences for all three areas analyzed: the Rad-1/3: median (interquartile range) in g/cm2, Rad-1/3: 0.760 (0.641-0.804) vs. 0.742 (0.642, 0.794), p = 0.016; ultradistal radius, Rad-UD: 0.433 (0.392-0.507) vs. 0.420 (0.356, 0.475), p = 0.004; and total radius, Rad-total: 0.603 (0.518, 0.655) vs. 0.599 (0.504, 0.642), p = 0.001). No such asymmetries were observed in any other groups. Lower aBMD in AVF forearm subregions resulted in misclassification of osteoporosis.In renal transplant recipients, a previously created distal fistula may exert a negative impact on the radial bone leading to significant site-to-site aBMD differences, which can result in diagnostic misclassifications."
https://openalex.org/W2884987512,"This study aimed to evaluate if domestic violence affected women's ability to prepare for childbirth. Birth preparedness and complication readiness (BP/CR) includes saving money, arranging transportation, identifying a skilled birth attendant, a health facility, and a blood donor before childbirth. During data collection, Nepal experienced two earthquakes and therefore it was possible to examine associations between domestic violence, women's BP/CR and effects of the earthquakes.Women who were between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation participated in a descriptive cross-sectional study at a hospital antenatal clinic in Nepal, where they completed a structured questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, obstetric history, experiences of domestic violence, and BP/CR. The 5-item Abuse Assessment Screen was used to assess prevalence of domestic violence, and a questionnaire on safe motherhood obtained from Jhpiego was used to assess BP/CR status. The participants self-completed the questionnaire on a tablet computer. Those who reported at least three out of five BP/CR activities were considered prepared for childbirth.A total of 1011 women participated in the study: 433 pre-earthquakes and 578 post-earthquakes. With respect to BP/CR, 78% had identified a health facility for childbirth and 65% had saved money prior to childbirth. Less than 50% had identified a birth attendant to assist with the delivery, transportation to a health facility, or arranged for a potential blood donor. Prior to the earthquakes, 38% were unprepared; by contrast, almost 62% were not prepared after the earthquakes. A significant association was found between exposure to violence and not being prepared for childbirth (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.4-3.9). The women with increased odds of not being prepared for childbirth were illiterate (AOR = 9.9, 95% CI:5.7-17), young (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI:1.6-7.2), from the most oppressed social classes (AOR = 3.0, 95% CI:1.2-7.6), were married to illiterate husbands (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI:1.2-5.2), had attended fewer than four antenatal visits (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.4-2.6), had low incomes (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI:1.1-2.9) or lived in rural settings (AOR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval CI:1.2-2.1).The paper identifies vulnerable women who require extra care from the health system, and draws attention to the need for interventions to reduce the harmful effects of domestic violence on women's preparations for childbirth."
https://openalex.org/W2883770731,"Activation of the β2 integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) in T cells induces stabilization of proinflammatory AU-rich element (ARE)-bearing mRNAs, by triggering the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of the mRNA-binding and -stabilizing protein HuR. However, the mechanism by which LFA-1 engagement controls HuR localization is not known. Here, we identify and characterize four key regulators of LFA-1-induced changes in HuR activity: the p38 pathway kinase MK2 and the constitutive nuclear proteins hnRNPs C, H1 and K. LFA-1 engagement results in rapid, sequential activation of p38 and MK2. Post-LFA-1 activation, MK2 inducibly associates with both hnRNPC and HuR, resulting in the dissociation of HuR from hnRNPs C, H1 and K. Freed from the three hnRNPs, HuR translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and mediates the stabilization of labile cytokine transcripts. Our results suggest that the modulation of T cell cytokine mRNA half-life is an intricate process that is negatively regulated by hnRNPs C, H1 and K and requires MK2 as a critical activator."
https://openalex.org/W2884951946,"This paper presents a new method to reduce the computational cost when using Neural Networks as Language Models, during recognition, in some particular scenarios. It is based on a Neural Network that considers input contexts of different length in order to ease the use of a fallback mechanism together with the precomputation of softmax normalization constants for these inputs. The proposed approach is empirically validated, showing their capability to emulate lower order N-grams with a single Neural Network. A machine translation task shows that the proposed model constitutes a good solution to the normalization cost of the output softmax layer of Neural Networks, for some practical cases, without a significant impact in performance while improving the system speed."
