In fact, the relation of vibrational excitation to reactivity has generally proven subtler and more complex. Thomas et al. studied how strong coupling of specific vibrational modes to an optical cavity might influence a molecule with two competing reactive sites. The molecule had two silicon centers that could react with fluoride by respective cleavage of a Si–C or Si–O bond. Exciting the vibrations at either center slowed down the overall reaction while favoring otherwise disfavored Si–O cleavage. Science , this issue p. 615"

However, many copper complexes tend to decay nonradiatively after photoexcitation. A recently described exception involves a two-coordinate complex that sandwiches the metal between an amide ligand and a carbene ligand. Hamze et al. thoroughly explored this motif and measured a nearly perfect luminescence efficiency. They used this property to produce a prototype blue organic light-emitting diode. The photodynamics appeared largely ligand-centered, with the excited state attributed to copper-facilitated charge transfer from amide to carbene. Science , this issue p. 601"

This applies to therapeutic drugs as well as food components and can be a major source of interpersonal variation in drug efficacy and toxicity. Zimmermann et al. found that individual drug responses depend on the genetics of an individual's microbiota. They explored the metabolism of nucleoside drugs (which are used as antivirals and antidepressants) in mice inoculated with a variety of mutant microbiota. They then modeled the pharmacokinetics in different body compartments and identified the host and microbe contributions. In some individuals, up to 70% of drug transformation can be ascribed to microbial metabolism. Science , this issue p. eaat9931"

Zhang et al. constructed an infrared-adaptive textile composed of polymer fibers coated with carbon nanotubes. The yarn itself expanded and collapsed based on heat and humidity, which changed the spacing of the fibers. Wider fiber spacing allowed the textile to breathe but also altered the infrared emissivity of the textile. This allowed for better heat exchange under hot and wet conditions. The self-adjusting emissivity of the textile could help toward wearable thermal-management attire. Science , this issue p. 619"

Little is known about the biological mechanisms that allow tumor cells to survive and grow within lymph nodes. Studying mouse models, Lee et al. found that tumor cells adapt to the lymph node microenvironment by shifting their metabolism toward fatty acid oxidation. This occurs through activation of a signaling pathway driven by the yes-associated protein (YAP) transcription factor. Importantly, inhibition of fatty acid oxidation or YAP signaling suppressed lymph node metastasis in the mice. Science , this issue p. 644"

Many ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, and the clinical presentation of ZIKV is nonspecific. Rodriguez-Barraquer et al. took advantage of a long-term health study under way in Salvador, Brazil, the epicenter of the recent outbreak in the Americas. They used multiple serological assays, from before and after the emergence of ZIKV in October 2015, to distinguish ZIKV immune responses from those against Dengue virus (DENV). About 73% of the population was attacked by ZIKV. The presence of preexisting antibodies to DENV was associated with less risk of ZIKV infection and fewer symptoms. Science , this issue p. 607"

https://openalex.org/W4237142507,"Cool mechanism for sensing cool In humans, cold is primarily sensed by transient receptor potential melastatin member 8 (TRPM8), a calcium channel. Yin et al. present cryo–electron microscopy structures of TRPM8 with cooling agents, membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and calcium. Structural and functional analyses showed that the PIP2 binding site in TRPM8 is completely different from PIP2 sites in other TRP channels. The binding of PIP2 and cooling agents allosterically enhance each other and activate the channel opening. Thus, the activation mechanism of TRPM8 is distinct from that used by other TRP channels.

https://openalex.org/W2912557076,"All the hues, even the blues Photosynthetic organisms must balance maximizing productive light absorption and protecting themselves from too much light, which causes damage. Both tasks require pigments—chlorophylls and carotenoids—which absorb light energy and either transfer it to photosystems or disperse it as heat. Wang et al. determined the structure of a fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c–binding protein (FCP) from a diatom. The structure reveals the arrangement of the specialized photosynthetic pigments in this light-harvesting protein. Fucoxanthin and chlorophyll c absorb the blue-green light that penetrates to deeper water and is not absorbed well by chlorophylls a or b. FCPs are related to the light-harvesting complexes of plants but have more binding sites for carotenoids and fewer for chlorophylls, which may help transfer and disperse light energy.

https://openalex.org/W2911906719,"How activation leads to gating Voltage-gated sodium (Na v ) channels are key players in electrical signaling. Central to their function is fast inactivation, and mutants that impede this cause conditions such as epilepsy and pain syndromes. The channels have four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs), with VSD4 playing an important role in fast inactivation. Clairfeuille et al. determined the structures of a chimera in which VSD4 of the cockroach channel Na v PaS is replaced with VSD4 from human Na v 1.7, both in the apo state and bound to a scorpion toxin that impedes fast activation (see the Perspective by Chowdhury and Chanda). The toxin traps VSD4 in a deactivated state. Comparison with the apo structure shows how interactions between VSD4 and the carboxyl-terminal region change as VSD4 activates and suggests how this would lead to fast inactivation.

https://openalex.org/W2914637605,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs interfere with the metabolism of arachidonic acid to proinflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes by targeting cyclooxygenases (COXs), 5-lipoxygenase (LOX), or the 5-LOX-activating protein (FLAP). These and related enzymes act in conjunction with marked crosstalk within a complex lipid mediator (LM) network where also specialized proresolving LMs (SPMs) are formed. Here, we present how prominent LM pathways can be differentially modulated in human proinflammatory M1 and proresolving M2 macrophage phenotypes that, upon exposure to Escherichia coli, produce either abundant prostaglandins and leukotrienes (M1) or SPMs (M2). Targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based metabololipidomics was applied to analyze and quantify the specific LM profiles. Besides expected on-target actions, we found that: 1) COX or 15-LOX-1 inhibitors elevate inflammatory leukotriene levels, 2) FLAP and 5-LOX inhibitors reduce leukotrienes in M1 but less so in M2 macrophages, 3) zileuton blocks resolution-initiating SPM biosynthesis, whereas FLAP inhibition increases SPM levels, and 4) that the 15-LOX-1 inhibitor 3887 suppresses SPM formation in M2 macrophages. Conclusively, interference with discrete LM biosynthetic enzymes in different macrophage phenotypes considerably affects the LM metabolomes with potential consequences for inflammation-resolution pharmacotherapy. Our data may allow better appraisal of the therapeutic potential of these drugs to intervene with inflammatory disorders.-Werner, M., Jordan, P.

https://openalex.org/W2914780443,"ChAT-ty T cells fight viral infection The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) is involved in processes such as muscle contraction, neuron communication, and vasodilation. Along with neurons, a population of immunological T cells and B cells express the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of ACh production. However, the role of immune cell–derived ACh is unclear. Cox et al. report that the cytokine interleukin-21 (IL-21) induces ChAT expression in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection (see the Perspective by Hickman). T cell–specific deletion of ChAT strongly impaired vasodilation and trafficking of antiviral T cells into infected tissues, which undermined the effective control of a chronic viral infection. Thus, IL-21 plays a critical role during chronic infection. Furthermore, the findings reveal a cholinergic mechanism that can regulate immune cell migration into tissues.

About one-third of hippocampal cells showed significantly correlated firing for both familiar and novel landscapes.

https://openalex.org/W2912328696,"Transient receptor potential melastatin member 8 (TRPM8) is a calcium ion (Ca2+)-permeable cation channel that serves as the primary cold and menthol sensor in humans. Activation of TRPM8 by cooling compounds relies on allosteric actions of agonist and membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), but lack of structural information has thus far precluded a mechanistic understanding of ligand and lipid sensing by TRPM8. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structures of TRPM8 in complex with the synthetic cooling compound icilin, PIP2, and Ca2+, as well as in complex with the menthol analog WS-12 and PIP2 Our structures reveal the binding sites for cooling agonists and PIP2 in TRPM8. Notably, PIP2 binds to TRPM8 in two different modes, which illustrate the mechanism of allosteric coupling between PIP2 and agonists. This study provides a platform for understanding the molecular mechanism of TRPM8 activation by cooling agents."
https://openalex.org/W2914654039,"The connection between Zika virus (ZIKV) and neurodevelopmental defects is widely recognized, although the mechanisms underlying the infectivity and pathology in primary human glial cells are poorly understood. Here we show that three isolated strains of ZIKV, an African strain MR766 (Uganda) and two closely related Asian strains R103451 (Honduras) and PRVABC59 (Puerto Rico) productively infect primary human astrocytes, although Asian strains showed a higher infectivity rate and increased cell death when compared to the African strain. Inhibition of AXL receptor significantly attenuated viral entry of MR766 and PRVABC59 and to a lesser extend R103451, suggesting an important role of TAM receptors in ZIKV cell entry, irrespective of lineage. Infection by PRVABC59 elicited the highest release of inflammatory molecules, with a 8-fold increase in the release of RANTES, 10-fold increase in secretion of IP-10 secretion and a 12-fold increase in IFN-β secretion when compared to un-infected human astrocytes. Minor changes in the release of several growth factors, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress response factors and the transcription factor, NF-κB were detected with the Asian strains, while significant increases in FOXO6, MAPK10 and JNK were detected with the African strain. Activation of the autophagy pathway was evident with increased expression of the autophagy related proteins Beclin1, LC3B and p62/SQSTM1 with all three strains of ZIKV. Pharmacological inhibition of the autophagy pathway and genetic inhibition of the Beclin1 showed minimal effects on ZIKV replication. The expression of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) was significantly increased with all three strains of ZIKV; pharmacological and genetic inhibition of TLR3 caused a decrease in viral titers and in viral-induced inflammatory response in infected astrocytes. We conclude that TLR3 plays a vital role in both ZIKV replication and viral-induced inflammatory responses, irrespective of the strains, while the autophagy protein Beclin1 influences host inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2912344035,"Despite the extensive literature investigating stylometry analysis in authorship attribution research, translator stylometry is an understudied research area. The identification of translator stylometry contributes to many fields including education, intellectual property rights and forensic linguistics. In a two stage process, this paper first evaluates the use of existing lexical measures for the translator stylometry problem. Similar to previous research we found that using vocabulary richness in its traditional form as it has been used in the literature could not identify translator stylometry. This encouraged us to design an approach with the aim of identifying the distinctive patterns of a translator by employing network-motifs. Networks motifs are small sub-graphs which aim at capturing the local structure of a complex network. The proposed approach achieved an average accuracy of 83% in three-way classification. These results demonstrate that classic tools based on lexical features can be used for identifying translator stylometry if they get augmented with appropriate non-parametric scaling. Moreover, the use of complex network analysis and network motifs mining provided made it possible to design features that can solve translator stylometry analysis problems."

Dairy does (n = 16) in mid-lactation were submitted to thermal neutral (TN; indoors; 15 to 20°C; 40 to 45% humidity) or HS (climatic chamber; 37°C day, 30°C night; 40% humidity) conditions according to a crossover design (2 periods of 21 days). Thermophysiological traits and lactational performances were recorded and milk composition analyzed during each period. Urine samples were collected at day 15 of each period for 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square—discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) assessment with cross validation were used to identify the goat urinary metabolome from the Human Metabolome Data Base. HS increased rectal temperature (1.2°C), respiratory rate (3.5-fold) and water intake (74%), but decreased feed intake (35%) and body weight (5%) of the lactating does. No differences were detected in milk yield, but HS decreased the milk contents of fat (9%), protein (16%) and lactose (5%). Metabolomics allowed separating TN and HS urinary clusters by PLS-DA. Most discriminating metabolites were hippurate and other phenylalanine (Phe) derivative compounds, which increased in HS vs. TN does. The greater excretion of these gut-derived toxic compounds indicated that HS induced a harmful gastrointestinal microbiota overgrowth, which should have sequestered aromatic amino acids for their metabolism and decreased the synthesis of neurotransmitters and thyroid hormones, with a negative impact on milk yield and composition. In conclusion, HS markedly changed the thermophysiological traits and lactational performances of dairy goats, which were translated into their urinary metabolomic profile through the presence of gut-derived toxic compounds. Hippurate and other Phe-derivative compounds are suggested as urinary biomarkers to detect heat-stressed dairy animals in practice."
https://openalex.org/W2914219472,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the main causes of chronic liver disease. NAFLD begins with excessive lipid accumulation in the liver and progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. NAFLD is closely linked to dysregulated hepatic lipid metabolism. Although recent studies have reported that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulates lipid metabolism, the roles of EGFR and EGFR inhibitors as modulators of lipid metabolism are largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether inhibiting EGFR using the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) PD153035 improves NAFLD. Our results demonstrate that EGFR was activated in liver tissues from high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice. Inhibiting EGFR using PD153035 significantly reduced phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling and sterol responsive elementary binding protein 1 and 2 expression, which prevented HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia by reducing de novo lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis and enhancing fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, inhibiting EGFR improved HFD-induced glucose intolerance. In conclusion, these results indicate that EGFR plays an important role in NAFLD and is a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2914472260,"The shoulder relies heavily on coordinated muscle activity for normal function owing to its limited osseous constraint. However, previous studies have failed to examine the sophisticated interrelationship between all muscles. It is essential for these normal relationships to be defined as a basis for understanding pathology. Therefore, the primary aim of the study was to investigate shoulder inter-muscular coordination during different planes of shoulder elevation. Twenty healthy subjects were included. Electromyography was recorded from 14 shoulder girdle muscles as subjects performed shoulder flexion, scapula plane elevation, abduction and extension. Cross-correlation was used to examine the coordination between different muscles and muscle groups. Significantly higher coordination existed between the rotator cuff and deltoid muscle groups during the initial (Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) = 0.79) and final (PCC = 0.74) stages of shoulder elevation compared to the mid-range (PCC = 0.34) (p = 0.020–0.035). Coordination between the deltoid and a functional adducting group comprising the latissimus dorsi and teres major was particularly high (PCC = 0.89) during early shoulder elevation. The destabilising force of the deltoid, during the initial stage of shoulder elevation, is balanced by the coordinated activity of the rotator cuff, latissimus dorsi and teres major. Stability requirements are lower during the mid-range of elevation. At the end-range of movement the demand for muscular stability again increases and higher coordination is seen between the deltoid and rotator cuff muscle groups. It is proposed that by appreciating the sophistication of normal shoulder function targeted evidence-based rehabilitation strategies for conditions such as subacromial impingement syndrome or shoulder instability can be developed."

We aimed to assess multiple micronutrient status (iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin D, folate and vitamin B12) in young Indian children and to investigate the role of these seven micronutrients and other non-nutritional factors on hemoglobin concentrations and anemia. One-hundred and twenty children aged 12 to 23 months were included in a cross-sectional nutritional assessment survey, of which 77 children provided a blood sample. Hemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), total body iron, zinc, selenium, retinol binding protein (RBP), folate, vitamin B12 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were measured, and adjusted for inflammation using C-reactive protein (CRP) and α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), where appropriate. Predictors for hemoglobin and anemia were identified in multiple regression models. Most of the children were classified as anemic, of which 86 to 93% was associated with iron deficiency depending on the indicator applied. Deficiencies of folate (37%), and notably vitamin D (74%) were also common; fewer children were classified with deficiencies of vitamin B12 (29%), zinc (25%), and vitamin A (17%) and selenium deficiency was nearly absent. Multiple micronutrient deficiencies were common with over half (57%) deficient in three or more micronutrients, and less than 10% of children were classified with adequate status for all the micronutrients measured. Iron status was found to be the only nutritional factor statistically significantly inversely associated with anemia (P = 0.003) in multivariate analysis after controlling for sex. A coordinated multi-micronutrient program is urgently needed to combat the co-existing micronutrient deficiencies in these young children to improve micronutrient status and reduce the high burden of childhood anemia."
https://openalex.org/W2911404451,"Introduction In many sub-Saharan African countries, confronting the dual epidemic of HIV and NCDs is a public health priority especially in high HIV burden countries such as South Africa. Evidence shows that poor health as a consequence of NCDs and HIV among the workforce increases absenteeism and leads to decrease in productivity. However, the prevalence of these co-occurring chronic conditions and associated factors is unknown in the educator workforce. Improved understanding has implications for their management and wellbeing of educators. This paper reports the prevalence of selected NCDs and associated factors among HIV positive educators in South Africa using the 2015/6 survey of Educators in Public Schools in South Africa. Methods This was a second-generation surveillance undertaken among educators in selected public schools in all nine provinces in South Africa. A multi-stage stratified cluster design with probability proportional to size sampling was used to draw a random sample of schools. Factors associated with presence of NCDs were determined using a multivariate backward stepwise logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 1 365 schools were sampled within which 21 495 (85.5%) educators were interviewed. Out of 2691, HIV Positive educators that responded to the questions on NCDs, 36.9% reported having NCDs. The most commonly reported NCDs were high blood pressure (17.4%), and stomach ulcers (13.5%). The increased odds of reporting the presence of NCDs was significantly associated with being female than male [aOR = 1.5: 95% CI (1.1–1.9), p<0.002], age 45 to 54 years [aOR = 1.8: 95% CI (1.4–2.2), p = p<0.001], and age 55 years and older than those 18 to 24 years [aOR = 2.7: 95% CI (1.8–3.9), p<0.001). The decreased odds of reporting the presence of NCDs was significantly associated with not being absent from school for health reasons [aOR = 0.7: 95% CI (0.6–0.9), p = 0.003]. Conclusion NCDs care and active screening should be an integral part of HIV programmes including interventions such as prevention, treatment, care and support amongst public school educators in SA. The education department will need to invest in health promotion intervention programmes to prevent and mitigate the negative impact of NCDs and HIV on the sector."
https://openalex.org/W2912662693,"The human triceps surae (two gastrocnemii and soleus) has aponeuroses in the proximal and distal aspects, the latter of which insert into the calcaneus by sharing the common Achilles tendon. These tendinous tissues are known to have elasticity and upon muscle contraction the aponeurosis is stretched both longitudinally (along the muscle’s line of action) and transversely. Higher aponeurosis transverse deformability has been documented, but there is a paucity of information on the morphology and mechanical properties of human aponeurosis. This study aimed to identify morphological and mechanical characteristics of the human triceps surae aponeuroses. Twenty-five triceps surae muscle-tendon units were procured from 13 human donors (formalin fixed, 6 males, 7 females) aged 67–91 years. Specimens of aponeuroses were excised from the eight regions (posterior and anterior regions of the gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, medial and lateral parts of soleus; proximal, middle, and distal sites each, 2–4 cm × 2–4 cm). Aponeurosis thickness was measured using a digital caliper. Uniaxial tensile tests were implemented to determine the mechanical properties of specimens loaded longitudinally (along the muscle’s line of action) and transversely. The aponeurosis thickness showed significant differences between muscles and sites, while Young’s modulus showed direction-dependent (longitudinal vs. transverse) differences within sites. Results show different morphology and mechanical properties of aponeuroses between synergist muscles. The reason for site-dependent differences in stiffness is due to a reduced aponeurosis thickness rather than a reduction in the material property. The anisotropic elastic feature (differences between longitudinal and transverse directions) of the aponeuroses was more pronounced than previous in vivo findings, suggesting inherent material design of the aponeurosis that matches three-dimensional contractile behavior of muscle fibers."

Data from the Health and Retirement Study (1998 to 2014) for non-Hispanic whites aged 50 and over (N = 21,612). Disability-free life expectancy by gender, living arrangement, and education are obtained from incidence-based multistate life tables. Overall, those who live only with their spouses/partners live 1–19 years longer with 3–25 more years without disability and 1–7 fewer years with disability than do those with other living arrangements. Among those with the same living arrangement, the higher educated live up to 6 years longer with up to 8 more years in a disability-free state and up to 2 fewer years in a disabled state. The study shows strong association between living arrangement and disability-free life expectancy by gender and education. Long-term care policy should take into account the length of life with/without disability by living arrangements and socioeconomic status and make use of the potential family resources."
https://openalex.org/W2914169312,"Bacteraemia is a risk factor for subsequent clinical deterioration and death. Current reliance on culture-based methods for detection of bacteraemia delays identification and assessment of this risk until after the optimal period for positively impacting treatment decisions has passed. Therefore, a method for rapid detection and identification of bacterial infection in the peripheral bloodstream in acutely ill patients is crucial for improved patient survival through earlier targeted antibiotic treatment. The turnaround time for current clinical laboratory methods ranges from 12 to 48 hours, emphasizing the need for a faster diagnostic test. Here we describe a novel assay for accelerated generic detection of bacteria in blood culture (BC) using peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization enhanced acoustic flow cytometry (PNA-FISH-AFC). For assay development, we used simulated blood cultures (BCs) spiked with one of three bacterial species at a low starting concentration of 10 CFU/mL: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Under current clinical settings, it takes a minimum of 12 hours incubation to reach positivity on the BacTEC system, corresponding to a bacterial concentration of 107−109 CFU/mL optimal for further analyses. In contrast, our PNA-FISH-AFC assay detected 103–104 CFU/mL bacteria in BC following a much shorter culture incubation of 5 to 10 hours. Using either PCR-based FilmArray assay or MALDI-TOF for bacterial detection, it took 7–10 and 12–24 hours of incubation, respectively, to reach the positive result. These findings indicate a potential time advantage of PNA-FISH-AFC assay for rapid bacterial detection in BC with significantly improved turnaround time over currently used laboratory techniques."

Therefore, it is an important challenge to establish the links between palmitoyltransferases and their targets. From publicly available data, we find that expression of human ZDHHC8 correlates significantly with cancer survival. To elucidate the organismal function of ZDHHC8, we study the Drosophila ortholog of hZDHHC8, CG34449/dZDHHC8. Knockdown of dZDHHC8 causes tissue overgrowth while dZDHHC8 mutants are larval lethal.

Following sensitization, animals were then sacrificed or romized into kidney transplant (G4, sensitized transplant control); desensitization with TACI-Ig followed by kidney transplant (G5, sensitized + pre-transplant TACI-Ig); kidney transplant with post-transplant TACI-Ig for 21 days (G6, sensitized + post-transplant TACI-Ig); desensitization with TACI-Ig followed by kidney transplant post-transplant TACI-Ig for 21 days (G7, sensitized + pre- post-transplant TACI-Ig). Animals were sacrificed on day 21 post-transplant tissues were analyzed using flow cytometry, IHC, ELISPOT, RT-PCR. Sensitized animals treated with APRIL/BLyS blockade demonstrated a significant decrease in marginal zone non-switched B lymphocyte populations (p<0.01). Antibody secreting cells were also significantly reduced in the sensitized APRIL/BLyS blockade treated group. Post-transplant APRIL/BLyS blockade treated animals were found to have significantly less C4d deposition less ABMR as defined by Banff classification when compared to groups receiving APRIL/BLyS blockade before transplant or both before after transplant (p<0.0001). The finding of worse ABMR in groups receiving APRIL/BLyS blockade before both before after transplant may indicate that B lymphocyte depletion in this setting also resulted in regulatory lymphocyte depletion resulting in a worse rejection. Data presented here demonstrates that the targeting of APRIL BLyS can significantly deplete mature B lymphocytes, antibody secreting cells, effectively decrease ABMR when given post-transplant in a sensitized animal model."

We assessed sociodemographics, smoking, body mass index, diabetes, substance abuse, and anxiety/depression. We used blood pressure categories defined by the Seventh Joint National Committee (JNC 7) classifications, which includes normal, pre-hypertension, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension.Among 5,428 adults, mean age was 31 years, 51% were male, and 35% tested HIV-positive. Before HIV testing, 47% (2,634) had a normal blood pressure, 40% (2,225) had prehypertension, and 10% (569) had stage 1 or 2 hypertension. HIV-infected adults had significantly lower blood pressure measurements and less hypertension, as compared to HIV-negative adults before HIV testing; while also having significantly elevated blood pressures after HIV testing. In a multivariable model, HIV-infected adults had a 30% lower odds of hypertension, compared to HIV-uninfected adults (aOR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.57-0.85). In a separate multivariable model, HIV-infected adults with CD4 ≤200 cells/mm3 had a 44% lower odds of hypertension (aOR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.38-0.83), as compared to adults with CD4 >200 cells/mm3. The mean arterial blood pressure was 6.5 mmHg higher among HIV-infected adults after HIV testing (p <0.001).HIV-infected adults experienced a transient blood pressure increase after receiving HIV results. Blood pressure measurements may be more accurate before HIV testing and repeated blood pressure measurements are recommended after ART initiation before formally diagnosing hypertension in HIV-infected adults."
https://openalex.org/W2912084600,"We generalize the notion of λ-superstrings, presented in a previous paper, to the notion of weighted λ-superstrings. This generalization entails an important improvement in the applications to vaccine designs, as it allows epitopes to be weighted by their immunogenicities. Motivated by these potential applications of constructing short weighted λ-superstrings to vaccine design, we approach this problem in two ways. First, we formalize the problem as a combinatorial optimization problem (in fact, as two polynomially equivalent problems) and develop an integer programming (IP) formulation for solving it optimally. Second, we describe a model that also takes into account good pairwise alignments of the obtained superstring with the input strings, and present a genetic algorithm that solves the problem approximately. We apply both algorithms to a set of 169 strings corresponding to the Nef protein taken from patiens infected with HIV-1. In the IP-based algorithm, we take the epitopes and the estimation of the immunogenicities from databases of experimental epitopes. In the genetic algorithm we take as candidate epitopes all 9-mers present in the 169 strings and estimate their immunogenicities using a public bioinformatics tool. Finally, we used several bioinformatic tools to evaluate the properties of the candidates generated by our method, which indicated that we can score high immunogenic λ-superstrings that at the same time present similar conformations to the Nef virus proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2911379986,"It is common practice for researchers to use antibodies to remove a specific cell type to infer its function. However, it is difficult to completely eliminate a cell type and there is often limited or no information as to how the cells which survive depletion are affected. This is particularly important for CD8+ T cells for two reasons. First, they are more resistant to mAb-mediated depletion than other lymphocytes. Second, targeting either the CD8α or CD8β chain could induce differential effects. We show here that two commonly used mAbs, against either the CD8α or CD8β subunit, can differentially affect cellular metabolism. Further, in vivo treatment leaves behind a population of CD8+ T cells with different phenotypic and functional attributes relative to each other or control CD8+ T cells. The impact of anti-CD8 antibodies on CD8+ T cell phenotype and function indicates the need to carefully consider the use of these, and possibly other “depleting” antibodies, as they could significantly complicate the interpretation of results or change the outcome of an experiment. These observations could impact how immunotherapy and modulation of CD8+ T cell activation is pursued."
https://openalex.org/W2911356673,"There is clear evidence for carrier-mediated transport of prolactin into the brain, and it has been widely assumed that prolactin receptors (PRLRs) in the choroid plexus (ChP) might mediate this transport. Using PRLR knockout mice, we recently showed that PRLRs in ChP are not required for prolactin transport into the brain. Hence, the function of PRLR in the ChP remains unknown. PRLR expression is increased in the ChP during lactation, suggesting a possible role in adaptive function of prolactin at this time. To gain insight into prolactin function in the ChP, we have utilized RNA sequencing and NanoString techniques to characterize transcriptional changes in response to differing levels of prolactin at diestrus, during pregnancy, and in lactation. We have observed opposing transcriptional effects of prolactin on the ChP in different physiologic states, being primarily inhibitory during diestrus but stimulatory in lactation. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), a highly expressing transcript found in the ChP, showed a 6-fold increase at lactation that returned to baseline on suppression of prolactin levels. These results indicate that Igf2 may be an important downstream mediator of prolactin-induced signaling in the ChP.-Phillipps, H. R., Rand, C. J., Brown, R. S. E., Kokay, I.

https://openalex.org/W2911497182,"Protective clothing manufacturers routinely test their products for resistance to liquid and viral penetration. Several of the test methods specified by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for penetration testing produce binary results (i.e. pass or fail), deliver imprecise pressure regulation, and do not record the location at which penetration events occur. Instead, our approach measures a continuous variable (time of penetration) during a slow and continuous increase of hydrostatic pressure and retains the location of penetration events. Using a fluorescent dye to enhance visual detection, we evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of penetration events. We then compare the time of liquid penetration with the time of penetration of two bacteriophages (Phi-X174 and MS2). For the fabric tested, the mean viral penetration occurred 0.29 minutes earlier than liquid penetration when solved by logistic regression. The breakthrough time of MS2 was not different from the Phi-X174 bacteriophage. The time of liquid penetration was a latent indicator of the time of viral penetration."
https://openalex.org/W2949694972,"We study the collective behaviour of zebrafish shoals of different numbers of individuals (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 20 AB zebrafish Danio rerio) in a constraint environment composed of two identical square rooms connected by a corridor. This simple set-up is similar to a natural patchy environment. We track the positions and the identities of the fish and compute the metrics at the group and at the individual levels. First, we show that the number of fish affects the behaviour of each individual in a group, the cohesion of the groups, the preferential interactions and the transition dynamics between the two rooms. Second, during collective departures, we show that the rankings of exit correspond to the topological organisations of the fish prior to their collective departure. This spatial organisation appears in the group a few seconds before a collective departure. These results provide new evidences on the spatial organisation of the groups and the effect of the number of fish on individual and collective behaviours in a patchy environment."
https://openalex.org/W2914026067,"This study investigated the critical care staff’s attitude, knowledge and involvement with donation, skills and confidence with donation-related tasks and their association with consent rates at the hospital level. In 2015, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among critical care staff of hospitals involved in organ donation using an anonymous online questionnaire with a response rate of 56.4% (n = 2799). The hospital level consent rate was obtained from the Swiss Monitoring of Potential Donors database (2013–2015). For each hospital, we calculated a mean score for each predictor of interest of the Hospital Attitude Survey and investigated the association with hospital consent rates with generalized linear mixed-effect models. In univariable analysis, one score point increase in doctors' confidence resulted in a 66% (95% CI: 45%–80%) reduction in the odds to consent, and one score point increase in nurses' attitudes resulted in a 223% (95% CI: 84%–472%) increase in the odds to consent. After simultaneously adjusting for all major predictors found in the crude models, only levels of education of medical and nursing staff remained as significant predictors for hospital consent rates. In Switzerland, efforts are needed to increase consent rates for organ donation and should concentrate on continuous support as well as specific training of the hospital staff involved in the donation process."
https://openalex.org/W2952288685,"Sociality has brought many advantages to various hymenoptera species, including their ability of regulating physical factors in their nest (e.g., temperature). Although less studied, humidity is known to be important for egg, larval and pupal development, and also for nectar concentration. Two subspecies of Apis mellifera of the M evolutionary lineage were used as models to test the ability of a superorganism (i.e. honeybee colony) to regulate the humidity in its nest (i.e. “hygroregulation hypothesis”) in four conservation centers: two in France (A. m. mellifera) and two in Portugal (A. m. iberiensis). We investigated the ability of both subspecies to regulate the humidity in hives daily, but also during the seasons for one complete year. Our data and statistical analysis demonstrated the capacity of the bees to regulate humidity in their hive, regardless of the day, season or subspecies. Furthermore, the study showed that humidity in beehives is stable even during winter, when brood is absent, and when temperature is known to be less stable in the beehives. These results suggest that humidity is important for honeybees at every life stage, maybe because of the ‘imprint’ of the evolutionary history of this hymenopteran lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2911507343,"Lipopolysacharride (LPS) forms the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria and contributes to the permeability barrier and immune response. In this study, we established a method for monitoring the LPS biosynthetic intermediates of the Raetz pathway (lpxA-lpxK) in Escherichia coli. Metabolites from compound-treated cells and genetically-perturbed cells were extracted from whole cells and concentrated by mixed-mode weak anion exchange (WAX) solid-phase extraction (SPE) prior to analysis by normal phase (NP)LC-MS/MS. Data was normalized to cell density and an internal standard prior to comparison against untreated cells in order to determine fold accumulation and depletion for affected metabolites. Using this LC-MS/MS method, we were able to reliably monitor changes in levels of the LPS intermediates in response to compound-treatment and genetic modification. In addition, we found that deletion of periplasmic CDP-diacylglycerol pyrophosphatase dramatically increased levels of the UDP-containing LPS intermediates, suggesting the enzymatic breakdown during sample preparation. This assay allows for probing a key essential pathway in Gram-negative bacteria in an effort to discover antibacterial agents that inhibit enzymes in the LPS biosynthetic pathway."

The propofol information was collected by routine epidemic surveillance and interviews. We linked several national databases to collect other related factors, including methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) attendance and incarceration. The serums were tested for recent infection by the LAg-avidity EIA assay and relationship of the trains by the Phylogenetic tree analysis. Analyses were conducted using the R Surveillance package for retrospective modeling for outbreak detection. A multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between propofol-injection and other related factors.There were 28 cases reported with propofol-injection, all of which were reported in Central Taiwan. A total of 11 (50%) cases among 22 propofol-injectors with serums were recent infections, which were higher than that 33 (23.4%) of non-propofol group. The phylogenetic tree indicated that 6 propofol-injectors were grouped together with the same cluster in circular. The HIV epidemic curve among PWID revealed an outbreak of 82 in 2015, which then decreased to 43 in 2016 after propofol began to be regulated as a Schedule 4 controlled drug in August 2015. In a multiple logistic regression, attendance at methadone clinics was associated with a significantly higher risk for propofol-injection (adjusted OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 0.98-5.98), and HIV reported in the year 2015 was associated with an increased risk of propofol-injection (adjusted OR = 4, 95% CI = 1.08-14.86).Our data indicate that the government regulation of propofol as a controlled drug strategy was associated with significant reduction in the spread of HIV among PWID."
https://openalex.org/W2913919526,"Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) mediates metabolic reshuffling and is ubiquitously upregulated in several cancer types. The non-metabolic function of PKM2 as key nuclear kinase and modulator of gene expression is instrumental in cancer progression and tumorigenesis. Here, we attempt to discern the non-canonical function of PKM2 as an epigenetic modulator and the underlying implication of this activity. Using 5'-FAM labelled reconstituted mononucleosome we have shown that PKM2 interacts with the complex through Histone H3 and possibly obstruct the access to DNA binding factors. Subsequently, the interaction negatively impacts the ATP dependent remodeling activity of Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding protein-7 (Chd7). Chd7 remodeling activity is required to ameliorate DNA damage and is crucial to genome stability. Our study shows that PKM2 blocks the Chd7 mediated sliding of nucleosome. It can be conjectured that stalling Chd7 may lead to impaired DNA damage and increased genomic instability. We propose a mechanism in which PKM2 negatively regulate nucleosome repositioning in chromatin and may exacerbate cancer by altering the nucleosome architecture. This research is imperative to our understanding of how altered cancer metabolism can potentially modulate the gene expression and sustain incessant proliferation by tweaking the chromatin topography."
https://openalex.org/W2912619921,"Purpose The aim of this paper is to show how a specialized planning and guidance application called Fraxinus, can be built on top of the CustusX platform (www.custusx.org), which is an open source image-guided intervention software platform. Fraxinus has been customized to meet the clinical needs in navigated bronchoscopy. Methods The application requirements for Fraxinus were defined in close collaboration between research scientists, software developers and clinicians (pulmonologists), and built on top of CustusX. Its superbuild system downloads specific versions of the required libraries and builds them for the application in question, including the selected plugins. New functionality is easily added through the plugin framework. The build process enables the creation of specialized applications, adding additional documentation and custom configurations. The toolkit’s libraries offer building blocks for image-guided applications. An iterative development process was applied, where the clinicians would test and provide feedback during the entire process. Results Fraxinus has been developed and is released as an open source planning and guidance application built on top of CustusX. It is highly specialized for bronchoscopy. The proposed workflow is adapted to the different steps in this procedure. The user interface of CustusX has been modified to enhance information, quality assurance and user friendliness with the intention to increase the overall yield for the patient. As the workflow of the procedure is relatively constant, some actions are predicted and automatically performed by the application, according to the requirements from the clinicians. Conclusions The CustusX platform facilitates development of new and specialized applications. The toolkit supports the process and makes important extension and injection points available for customization."

However, the genetic signatures of artificial selection are unclear. In this study, we sequenced the genome sequences of these three artificially selected populations and their ancestral population (mallard, M). We then compared the genome sequences between AS and M and between LTPD and FTPD using integrated strategies such as anchoring scaffolds to pseudo-chromosomes, mutation detection, selective screening, GO analysis, qRT-PCR, and protein multiple sequences alignment to uncover genetic signatures of selection. We anchored duck scaffolds to pseudo-chromosomes and obtained 28 pseudo-chromosomes, accounting for 84% of duck genome in length. Totally 78 and 99 genes were found to be under selection between AS and M and between LTPD and FTPD. Genes under selection between AS and M mainly involved in pigmentation and heart rates, while genes under selection between LTPD and FTPD involved in muscle development and fat deposition. A heart rate regulator (HCN1), the strongest selected gene between AS and M, harbored a GC deletion in AS and displayed higher mRNA expression level in M than in AS. IGF2R, a regulator of skeletal muscle mass, was found to be under selection between FTPD and LTPD. We also found two nonsynonymous substitutions in IGF2R, which might lead to higher IGF2R mRNA expression level in FTPD than LTPD, indicating the two nonsynonymous substitutions might play a key role for the regulation of duck skeletal muscle mass. Taken together, these results of this study provide valuable insight for the genetic basis of duck artificial selection."
https://openalex.org/W2911728401,"When I was younger I loved going on long, meandering trail runs on the outskirts of my hometown in the Australian countryside. It was my favorite way to escape the stresses of everyday life. I didn't worry about time or distance or pace. I just enjoyed the immersive and meditative experience of running in a beautiful place. So, when I was back in my hometown for a visit after a tough first year of my Ph.D. program, I thought a trail run was just what I needed. But instead of helping me relax, the run did just the opposite: It made me anxious. In the end, I figured out why.

> “I was struggling—both on trail runs and in grad school.” 

After I moved to the city for college, where my runs traversed flat concrete paths instead of winding dirt trails, I bought a GPS watch and used it obsessively. When I was back in the country, it constantly alerted me to the fact that I wasn't keeping up with my usual pace. I turned my watch off, thinking that would allow me to enjoy my surroundings and find the peace I expected, but I still worried that I was underperforming. My frustration continued as I went on a few more runs in the ensuing days. “Why can't I let go and just enjoy myself?” I wondered. But after some introspection, I realized why I was struggling—both on trail runs and in grad school.

Going into my Ph.D., I had thought that my solid undergraduate track record and strong work ethic would set me up for instant success. To my surprise, I was wrong. I lacked confidence in my research abilities and constantly felt my progress was too slow. Other students' self-assurance, coupled with the tangible results they were achieving, made me feel insecure. Finally, one day I broke down in tears in my adviser's office, wondering whether I would be able to deliver a Ph.D. of any value.

Then came my visit home—and a realization about my trail runs: I was having trouble because I hadn't properly adjusted my expectations to the differences between an urban run and a trail run. In the city, I set target distances and target paces, and I didn't feel satisfied with my run unless my GPS watch told me that I had achieved my goals. On the undulating trails back home, I couldn't keep up—and I wasn't satisfied.

Similarly, as an undergraduate I had thrived on continuous feedback, usually in the form of grades. I had grown accustomed to getting constant assurance that I had done a good job, as well as having a set of discrete, manageable tasks. In my new life as a Ph.D. student, there was no obvious to-do list, and I didn't receive regular, standardized feedback.

In short, I realized that a Ph.D. is like a trail run: Sometimes you can run fast. But at other times, you might find yourself chugging up a steep, winding trail at a snail's pace. And that's OK. Obstacles and slow-moving segments are inevitable, and success looks and feels different on a challenging segment than it does on a smooth, flat path. Sometimes it's best to take a deep breath, do your best to tackle the challenge, and—in the meantime—appreciate that you're doing something you love.

When I returned to grad school, I shifted my mindset based on my trail-running epiphany and tried to take a more holistic view of my progress. I focused less on the volume of work I completed and how long it'd been since my adviser complimented me on my progress. Instead, I asked myself questions such as: “Are my time frames realistic for the task? Is my confidence low because I'm working on something I've never encountered before? Will I be able to maintain this level of work output for the length of the project?”

Now, as I near the end of my Ph.D., I'm pleased to report that I'm a happier, more confident scientist. I still hear negative voices ringing in my head at times—telling me that I haven't lived up to my expectations—but for the most part they've faded. I know that a Ph.D. can be a turbulent, unpredictable process, and I've learned to cut myself some slack when I hit a steep hill.

https://openalex.org/W2913022055,"Basal autophagy is as a compressive catabolic mechanism engaged in the breakdown of damaged macromolecules and organelles leading to the recycling of elementary nutrients. Thought essential to cellular refreshing, little is known about the origin of a constitutional rate of basal autophagy. Here, we found that loss of Drosophila vacuolar peduncle (vap), a presumed GAP enzyme, is associated with enhanced basal autophagy rate and physiological alterations resulting in a wasteful cell energy balance, a hallmark of overactive autophagy. By contrast, starvation-induced autophagy was disrupted in vap mutant conditions, leading to a block of maturation into autolysosomes. This phenotype stem for exacerbated biogenesis of PI(3)P-dependent endomembranes, including autophagosome membranes and ectopic fusions of vesicles. These findings shed new light on the neurodegenerative phenotype found associated to mutant vap adult brains in a former study. A partner of Vap, Sprint (Spri), acting as an endocytic GEF for Rab5, had the converse effect of leading to a reduction in PI(3)P-dependent endomembrane formation in mutants. Spri was conditional to normal basal autophagy and instrumental to the starvation-sensitivity phenotype specific of vap. Rab5 activity itself was essential for PI(3)P and for pre-autophagosome structures formation. We propose that Vap/Spri complexes promote a cell surface-derived flow of endocytic Rab5-containing vesicles, the traffic of which is crucial for the implementation of a basal autophagy rate."
