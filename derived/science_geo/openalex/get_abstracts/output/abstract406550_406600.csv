https://openalex.org/W2131559925,"A milestone in biology was reached in 2010, with the production of a viable bacterium with a genome that had been reassembled artificially from synthetic DNA segments. Now Jef Boeke and colleagues report the production of the world's first synthetic eukaryotic chromosome arms, a first step in a project called Sc2.0, which aims to design and construct an entirely synthetic version of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. In this initial phase, two custom-designed synthetic chromosome arms were incorporated into the yeast genome, replacing the endogenous sequence. Recent advances in DNA synthesis technology have enabled the construction of novel genetic pathways and genomic elements, furthering our understanding of system-level phenomena1,2,3,4,5,6,7. The ability to synthesize large segments of DNA allows the engineering of pathways and genomes according to arbitrary sets of design principles. Here we describe a synthetic yeast genome project, Sc2.0, and the first partially synthetic eukaryotic chromosomes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome synIXR, and semi-synVIL. We defined three design principles for a synthetic genome as follows: first, it should result in a (near) wild-type phenotype and fitness; second, it should lack destabilizing elements such as tRNA genes or transposons8,9; and third, it should have genetic flexibility to facilitate future studies. The synthetic genome features several systemic modifications complying with the design principles, including an inducible evolution system, SCRaMbLE (synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by loxP-mediated evolution). We show the utility of SCRaMbLE as a novel method of combinatorial mutagenesis, capable of generating complex genotypes and a broad variety of phenotypes. When complete, the fully synthetic genome will allow massive restructuring of the yeast genome, and may open the door to a new type of combinatorial genetics based entirely on variations in gene content and copy number."
https://openalex.org/W2088046822,"Foxp3+ T-regulatory cells (Tregs) normally serve to attenuate immune responses and are key to maintenance of immune homeostasis. Over the past decade, Treg cells have become a major focus of research for many groups, and various functional subsets have been characterized. Recently, the Ikaros family member, Helios, was reported as a marker to discriminate naturally occurring, thymic-derived Tregs from those peripherally induced from naïve CD4+ T cells. We investigated Helios expression in murine and human T cells under resting or activating conditions, using well-characterized molecules of naïve/effector/memory phenotypes, as well as a set of Treg-associated markers. We found that Helios-negative T cells are enriched for naïve T cell phenotypes and vice versa. Moreover, Helios can be induced during T cell activation and proliferation, but regresses in the same cells under resting conditions. We demonstrated comparable findings using human and murine CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs, as well as in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Since Helios expression is associated with T cell activation and cellular division, regardless of the cell subset involved, it does not appear suitable as a marker to distinguish natural and induced Treg cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967543711,"Nodes in cooperative networks, such as those between plants and their pollinators or service providers and their contractors, form complex networks of interdependences. In these mutualistic networks, nodes that contribute to the nestedness of the network improve its stability. However, this study, using ecological data from 20 plant–pollinator networks and from socioeconomic networks, shows that these same nodes do not reap the benefits. In fact, the nodes that contribute the most to network persistence are also the most vulnerable to extinction. The architecture of mutualistic networks facilitates coexistence of individual participants by minimizing competition relative to facilitation1,2. However, it is not known whether this benefit is received by each participant node in proportion to its overall contribution to network persistence. This issue is critical to understanding the trade-offs faced by individual nodes in a network3,4,5. We address this question by applying a suite of structural and dynamic methods to an ensemble of flowering plant/insect pollinator networks. Here we report two main results. First, nodes contribute heterogeneously to the overall nested architecture of the network. From simulations, we confirm that the removal of a strong contributor tends to decrease overall network persistence more than the removal of a weak contributor. Second, strong contributors to collective persistence do not gain individual survival benefits but are in fact the nodes most vulnerable to extinction. We explore the generality of these results to other cooperative networks by analysing a 15-year time series of the interactions between designer and contractor firms in the New York City garment industry. As with the ecological networks, a firm's survival probability decreases as its individual nestedness contribution increases. Our results, therefore, introduce a new paradox into the study of the persistence of cooperative networks, and potentially address questions about the impact of invasive species in ecological systems and new competitors in economic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2094206434,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF1α) is an essential part of the HIF-1 transcriptional complex that regulates angiogenesis, cellular metabolism, and cancer development. In von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-null kidney cancer cell lines, we reported previously that HIF1α proteins can be acetylated and inhibited by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors or specific siRNA against HDAC4. To investigate the mechanism and biological consequence of the inhibition, we have generated stable HDAC4 knockdown via shRNA in VHL-positive normal and cancer cell lines. We report that HDAC4 regulates HIF1α protein acetylation and stability. Specifically, the HIF1α protein acetylation can be increased by HDAC4 shRNA and decreased by HDAC4 overexpression. HDAC4 shRNA inhibits HIF1α protein stability. In contrast, HDAC1 or HDAC3 shRNA has no such inhibitory effect. Mutations of the first five lysine residues (lysine 10, 11, 12, 19, and 21) to arginine within the HIF1α N terminus reduce protein acetylation but render the mutant HIF1α protein resistant to HDAC4 and HDACi-mediated inhibition. Functionally, in VHL-positive cancer cell lines, stable inhibition of HDAC4 decreases both the HIF-1 transcriptional activity and a subset of HIF-1 hypoxia target gene expression. On the cellular level, HDAC4 inhibition reduces the hypoxia-related increase of glycolysis and resistance to docetaxel chemotherapy. Taken together, the novel biological relationship between HDAC4 and HIF1α presented here suggests a potential role for the deacetylase enzyme in regulating HIF-1 cancer cell response to hypoxia and presents a more specific molecular target of inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2070228490,"The human SLC39A13 gene encodes ZIP13, a member of the LZT (LIV-1 subfamily of ZIP zinc transporters) family. The ZIP13 protein is important for connective tissue development, and its loss of function is causative for the spondylocheiro dysplastic form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. However, this protein has not been characterized in detail. Here we report the first detailed biochemical characterization of the human ZIP13 protein using its ectopic expressed and the purified recombinant protein. Protease accessibility, microscopic, and computational analyses demonstrated that ZIP13 contains eight putative transmembrane domains and a unique hydrophilic region and that it resides with both its N and C termini facing the luminal side on the Golgi. Analyses including cross-linking, immunoprecipitation, Blue Native-PAGE, and size-exclusion chromatography experiments indicated that the ZIP13 protein may form a homo-dimer. We also demonstrated that ZIP13 mediates zinc influx, as assessed by monitoring the expression of the metallothionein gene and by detecting the intracellular zinc level with a zinc indicator, FluoZin-3. Our data indicate that ZIP13 is a homo-dimerized zinc transporter that possesses some domains that are not found in other LZT family members. This is the first biochemical characterization of the physiologically important protein ZIP13 and the demonstration of homo-dimerization for a mammalian ZIP zinc transporter family member. This biochemical characterization of the human ZIP13 protein provides important information for further investigations of its structural characteristics and function.

There is increasing evidence for the importance of zinc (Zn) in biology (1Fukada T. Yamasaki S. Nishida K. Murakami M. Hirano T. J. Biol. Inorg.

Zn2+ is an essential trace element, and low Zn2+ causes Zn2+ deficiency syndrome, which is characterized by growth retardation and skin and bone abnormalities (4Prasad A.S. Nutrition. 1995; 11: 93-99PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yamaguchi M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 338: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Excess Zn2+ causes symptomatic anemia, as a result of Zn2+-induced copper deficiency (7Pawa S. Khalifa A.J. Ehrinpreis M.N. Schiffer C.A. Siddiqui F.A. Am J. Med. Sci. 2008; 336: 430-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Not unexpectedly, a disturbance in the normal balance of Zn2+ results in aberrant cellular functions, and such imbalances have been implicated in the etiology of several human diseases (8Fukada T. Kambe T. Metallomics. 2011; 3: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Nishida K. Hasegawa A. Nakae S. Oboki K. Saito H. Yamasaki S. Hirano T. J. Exp.

Computational analysis suggests that 4–10% of the proteins encoded by the human genome possess Zn2+ binding sequences (11Andreini C. Banci L. Bertini I. Rosato A. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations indicate that a balance between intracellular and extracellular Zn2+ levels is critical for basic cellular functions involved in growth, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Thus, the Zn2+ balance must be tightly regulated, and this is accomplished by Zn2+ transport proteins (8Fukada T. Kambe T. Metallomics. 2011; 3: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The Zn2+ level in a cell is controlled through the coordinated actions of the ZIP/SLC39A and ZnT 2The abbreviations used are: ZnTzinc transporterTMtransmembraneBNblue nativeLZTLIV-1 subfamily of ZIP zinc transportersSPCsignal peptidase complexERendoplasmic reticulumPNGase FN-oligosaccharide glycopeptidaseInt-Lintracellular loopSf9Spodoptera frugiperda 9MT1Ametallothionein 1ABis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolTPENN,N,N′,N′-Tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. /SLC30A Zn2+ transporter families (8Fukada T.

Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R. Nagao M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Several reports on the mechanisms of Zn2+ transport based on cell biological assays have shown that at least two members of the ZIP family, ZIP8 and ZIP14, function as Zn2+/HCO3−-dependent symporters; a HCO3− gradient across the membrane is used to import Zn2+ into the cytoplasm (14He L.

On the other hand, ZIPB, a bacterial ZIP protein homolog, showed a channel-like Zn2+ flux in a proteoliposome study (17Lin W. Chai J. Love J. Fu D. J. Biol.

The ZIP family can be divided into four subfamilies based on amino acid sequence similarity: ZIPI, ZIPII, GufA, and LZT (8Fukada T. Kambe T. Metallomics. 2011; 3: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 12Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The LZT family members, which are only found in eukaryotic cells, share the Pro-Ala-Leu (PAL) and His-Glu-X-X-His (HEXXH, where X is any amino acid) motifs (12Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The conserved PAL motif is in the N-terminal region and appears to be involved in protein processing (18Kambe T. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The highly conserved, potential metalloprotease HEXXH motif is located within TM5 (12Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). ZIP13 belongs to the LZT family (8Fukada T. Kambe T.

By analyzing Zip13 knock-out (KO) mice, we previously demonstrated that ZIP13 is required for connective tissue formation, which is mediated at least in part by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced nuclear localization of Smad proteins (19Fukada T. Civic N. Furuichi T. Shimoda S. Mishima K. Higashiyama H. Idaira Y. Asada Y. Kitamura H. Yamasaki S. Hojyo S. Nakayama M. Ohara O. Koseki H. Dos Santos H.G. Bonafe L. Ha-Vinh R. Zankl A. Unger S.

In a connection between mouse research and human disease, we found that a rare inherited human connective tissue disorder, diagnosed as a novel type of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), spondylocheiro dysplastic-EDS, exhibits phenotypes that are highly correlated with those of Zip13-KO mice (19Fukada T.

These findings established that ZIP13 has an indispensable role in connective tissue development and its involvement in disorders; however, the structural characterization of the human ZIP13 protein, such as its topology, conformation, and unique motifs, are still unknown. Here we characterized the human ZIP13 protein by a series of biochemical experiments as well as bioinformatics analyses. These data and materials will be useful for further investigations, in particular, in determining the three-dimensional structure of the ZIP13 protein. 293T cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics at 37 °C. To prepare the Zn2+-depleted culture medium, FBS was incubated with 10 g of Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad) per 50 ml of FBS for 1 h at 4 °C and then filtered for sterilization. FLAG-tagged ZIP13 (see Fig. 5, C and D) was generated as previously described (19Fukada T. Civic N. Furuichi T. Shimoda S. Mishima K. Higashiyama H. Idaira Y. Asada Y. Kitamura H. Yamasaki S. Hojyo S. Nakayama M. Ohara O. Koseki H. Dos Santos H.G. Bonafe L. Ha-Vinh R. Zankl A. Unger S. Kraenzlin M.E. Beckmann J.S. Saito I. Rivolta C. Ikegawa S. Superti-Furga A. Hirano T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To construct V5-tagged ZIP13, the PCR-amplified product was ligated into pcDNA6.2/V5-DEST (Invitrogen) using Gateway Technology according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following standard procedures. For recombinant protein production with the BaculoDirect system (Invitrogen), a linker composed of Arg-Leu-Leu-Pro-Val-Thr-Thr-Glu-Gly-Pro-Ser-Gly (RLLPVTTEGPSG) and a thrombin recognition site composed of Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser (LVPRGS) were attached to the C terminus of ZIP13 in pDONR 221 (Invitrogen). For SDS-PAGE, samples were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue. Samples of protein (20 μg) were loaded onto 5–20 or 10–20% gradient gels. Native-PAGETM Novex Bis-Tris gels (for BN-PAGE) were purchased from Invitrogen, and the sample preparation and electrophoresis were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoblotting analysis, the gel was electroblotted to a PVDF membrane, which was blocked in 5% skim milk and incubated with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Secondary detection was carried out using a goat anti-mouse antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Cells cultured on glass coverslips in 35-mm glass base dishes (Iwaki) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% BSA for 5 min, and then incubated with an anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), anti-GM130 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-calnexin antibody (Cell Signaling), and DAPI (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence was detected after secondary staining with the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) and the Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). For FluoZin-3 staining, cells were incubated with 100 μm ZnSO4 for 6 h treated with or without 50 μm Zn2+ chelator TPEN (Dojindo) for 30 min and treated with 5 μm FluoZin-3 (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Twenty-four hours after being transfected with plasmids, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the soluble fraction was incubated with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or an anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h. The immune complexes were pulled down with protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and washed with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Samples were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. 293T cells expressing the V5-tagged ZIP13 protein were homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 (HEPES buffer), and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min. The membrane fraction was isolated by further ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in HEPES buffer containing 10% glycerol with or without 1% Triton X-100. The proteinase reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h for trypsin (Promega) and for 1 min for proteinase K (Merck). The reactions were quenched by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The expression plasmid for the double-tagged ZIP13 protein containing C-terminal His6 and the V5 epitope (ZIP13-V5-His) was constructed using the BaculoDirect system (Invitrogen). The ZIP13-V5-His protein was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified with Ni-NTA resin, and the tags were removed by thrombin digestion. The purified ZIP13 protein was treated with proteinase K and separated by SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The stained protein bands were individually excised from the gel for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Samples of the isolated membrane fraction from 293T cells containing 20 μg protein were treated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 1 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were then analyzed by immunoblotting. Samples of the isolated membrane fraction from 293T cells containing 20 μg of protein were treated with 0.5 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. The reaction was quenched by adding 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA by ReverTra Ace (Toyobo) primed with Oligo(dT)12–18 (Invitrogen). The measurement was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara). The primer sequences used for human ZIP13 and MT1A (Takara) are available upon request. The two-tailed Student's t test was used to analyze the difference between two groups. We first determined the potential translational start codon for the ZIP13 protein. NetStart1.0 predicted two potential start codons in the ZIP13 transcript, Start1 and Start2 (Fig. 1, A and B). The ZIP13 protein generated using the Start1 codon would be 10 amino acids longer than that obtained using Start2 (Fig. 1C). To determine the de facto start codon, we constructed an expression vector for each, transfected it into cells, and assessed the transcript level. As shown in Fig. 1D, the ZIP13 mRNA level driven from the Start1 expression plasmid (pStart1) was undetectable, whereas the transcription from Start2 (pStart2) was clearly detectable, suggesting that Start2 is the start codon used for translation in the ectopic expression system. We, therefore, used the pStart2 expression vector in our experiments. To further clarify the human ZIP13 structural profile, we performed a hydropathy analysis using the TMpred program, which is considered to be an appropriate algorithm for predicting the TM domains of the LZT family (12Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This analysis showed that the ZIP13 protein contains eight membrane-spanning domains (Fig. 1E) and that the hydropathy of the fourth and fifth TM domains (TM4 and TM5) was lower than that of the others (Fig. 1E), probably due to the putative Zn2+ binding HN and HEXXH motifs in TM4 and TM5 (Fig. 1F) (12Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 22Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, a small signal peptide-like peak of hydrophobicity was detected close to the initial starting Met residue (Fig. 1E). NetStart1.0 and SignalP revealed a SPC cleavage site between the 22nd and 23rd amino acids from the N terminus, predicting a 22-amino acid long signal peptide (Fig. 1G). The predicted signal peptide could be divided into three regions: an N-terminal region (n-region), a hydrophobic region (h-region), and a C-terminal region (c-region) (Fig. 1G). The N-terminal, hydrophobic, and C-terminal regions, respectively, contained one positively charged residue, a high Leu content, and two small residues (Ala and Gly) ahead of the SPC cleavage site (Fig. 1G). This pattern is identical to that of a typical ER signal peptide (23Paetzel M. Karla A. Strynadka N.C. Dalbey R.E. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4549-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Downstream of the putative SPC-cleavage site, the ZIP13 protein contained a PAL motif, which is a sequence common to all LZT family members (Fig. 1, G and H). Alignment of the LZT family member PAL motif sequences revealed two groups: ZIP13 and ZIP7 have a basic amino acid, i.e. Arg (ZIP13) or Lys (ZIP7), after the PAL motif, whereas in all the other LZT family members the PAL motif is followed by a hydrophobic residue, Leu or Ile (Fig. 1H). In addition, all the LZT members except ZIP13 have a single or tandem Gln residue(s) near the PAL motif, suggesting that the functional redundancy and/or difference among LZT family members may be defined by this motif. We further examined the membrane topology of human ZIP13 by biochemical experiments. Using the human ZIP13 protein with a V5 sequence at its C terminus (ZIP13-V5), we first assessed whether the ZIP13 protein contains a glycosylation site like other LZT family members (24Hogstrand C. Kille P. Nicholson R.I. Taylor K.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2009; 15: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Hojyo S. Fukada T. Shimoda S. Ohashi W. Bin B.H. Koseki H. Hirano T. PLoS One. 2011; 6: e18059Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The membrane fraction from ZIP13-V5-transfected 293T cells was treated with an N-oligosaccharide glycopeptidase (PNGase F) that digests sugar molecules from N-linked glycoproteins and was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, no apparent mobility shift of the ZIP13 protein bands was detected after PNGase F treatment (Fig. 2A, left panel), whereas a shift to lower molecular masses was clearly observed for the ZIP14 protein after PNGase F treatment (Fig. 2A, right panel) (25Hojyo S. Fukada T. Shimoda S. Ohashi W. Bin B.H. Koseki H. Hirano T. PLoS One. 2011; 6: e18059Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), indicating that the ZIP13 protein is rarely glycosylated, consistent with the prediction by the NetGlyc software (Fig. 2B, left). The endogenous mouse ZIP13 protein is reported to localize to the Golgi in cells of mesenchymal origin (19Fukada T. Civic N. Furuichi T. Shimoda S. Mishima K. Higashiyama H. Idaira Y. Asada Y. Kitamura H. Yamasaki S. Hojyo S. Nakayama M. Ohara O. Koseki H. Dos Santos H.G. Bonafe L. Ha-Vinh R. Zankl A. Unger S. Kraenzlin M.E. Beckmann J.S. Saito I. Rivolta C. Ikegawa S. Superti-Furga A. Hirano T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To clarify whether this is also the case for human ZIP13, we established 293T cells expressing human ZIP13-V5 and analyzed them by immunocytochemistry. Using an anti-V5 antibody, we detected the major signal of the ZIP13-V5 protein in the perinuclear space (Fig. 2C). It overlapped well with the Golgi marker GM130 (Fig. 2C, upper panel) and partially with the ER marker Calnexin (Fig. 2C, lower panel), suggesting that the human ZIP13 protein is mainly located at the Golgi, as predicted by the TargetP program (Fig. 2D). To further define ZIP13 membrane topology (Fig. 1E), we next determined the direction of its C terminus. The isolated membrane fraction from ZIP13-V5-transfected 293T cells was used for protease accessibility experiments. The samples were treated with trypsin, then separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-V5 antibody to detect the C terminus of the ZIP13 protein. If the C terminus of the ZIP13 protein were located on the luminal side (Fig. 2E), a trypsin recognition site at its C-terminal linker region would be readily exposed to trypsin in the presence of Triton X-100. On the other hand, if the C-terminal region were located on the cytoplasmic side, the cleavage of the C-terminal V5 tag by trypsin could occur independent of Triton X-100 treatment. As shown in Fig. 2F, in the presence of Triton X-100 the cleavage of the C-terminal V5 tag of the ZIP13 protein was clearly trypsin dose-dependent (Fig. 2F, right upper panel) but not in the absence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 2F, left upper panel). Furthermore, no obvious small V5 tag-containing fragments of ZIP13 appeared with trypsin treatment, suggesting that the C-terminal region of the human ZIP13 protein is located on the luminal side. Calnexin was used as a positive control for the trypsin accessibility experiment (Fig. 2F, lower panels). Calnexin consists of a large (410 amino acid) N-terminal luminal domain, a single TM domain, and a short (90-amino acid) C-terminal cytosolic domain. The large N-terminal luminal domain of Calnexin would be exposed to trypsin by Triton X-100 treatment; thus, a stronger digestion pattern appeared in the Triton X-100-treated than untreated samples labeled with an anti-calnexin antibody specific for a sequence near Ala-51 (Fig. 2F, right lower panel). Together, our results show that the basic structural and membrane topology of human ZIP13 is that of a Golgi-localized, eight-TM-domain protein with little glycosylation and a luminal C terminus. All LZT family members have eight TM domains, but the sequences and lengths of the hydrophilic regions vary (12Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To investigate these regions on the ZIP13 protein, we performed proteolysis experiments with a serine protease, proteinase K. The isolated membrane fraction from 293T cells expressing the ZIP13-V5 protein was treated with proteinase K in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 followed by immunoblotting with an anti-V5 antibody to locate the cleavage sites. Three major fragments, including ZIP13 itself, appeared after proteinase K treatment both with and without Triton X-100 (Fig. 3A, left), implying that at least one main digestion site was on the hydrophilic region(s) of the ZIP13 protein that faces the cytoplasm. Based on the apparent molecular weight of the cleaved fragments (fragment 1 (F1) and fragment 2 (F2) were about 23 and 12 kDa, respectively) and on the observation that Triton X-100 was not needed for the proteinase K accessi"

Further, we demonstrated that APα promoted neurogenesis in the hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ) and reversed learning and memory deficits in the male triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's (3xTgAD). In the current study, we determined the efficacy of APα to promote the survival of newly generated neural cells while simultaneously reducing Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the 3xTgAD male mouse model. Comparative analyses between three different APα treatment regimens indicated that APα administered 1/week for 6 months was maximally efficacious for simultaneous promotion of neurogenesis and survival of newly generated cells and reduction of AD pathology. We further investigated the efficacy of APα to impact Aβ burden. Treatment was initiated either prior to or post intraneuronal Aβ accumulation. Results indicated that APα administered 1/week for 6 months significantly increased survival of newly generated neurons and simultaneously reduced Aβ pathology with greatest efficacy in the pre-pathology treatment group. APα significantly reduced Aβ generation in hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala, which was paralleled by decreased expression of Aβ-binding-alcohol-dehydrogenase. In addition, APα significantly reduced microglia activation as indicated by reduced expression of OX42 while increasing CNPase, an oligodendrocyte myelin marker. Mechanistic analyses indicated that pre-pathology treatment with APα increased expression of liver-X-receptor, pregnane-X-receptor, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA-reductase (HMG-CoA-R), three proteins that regulate cholesterol homeostasis and clearance from brain. Together these findings provide preclinical evidence for the optimal treatment regimen of APα to achieve efficacy as a disease modifying therapeutic to promote regeneration while simultaneously decreasing the pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease."

Intestinal epithelial contact with commensal bacteria and/or their products has been shown to activate noninflammatory signaling pathways, such as extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), thus influencing homeostatic processes. We previously demonstrated that commensal bacteria stimulate ERK pathway activity via interaction with formyl peptide receptors (FPRs). In the current study, we expand on these findings and show that commensal bacteria initiate ERK signaling through rapid FPR-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and subsequent modulation of MAP kinase phosphatase redox status. ROS generation induced by the commensal bacteria Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and the FPR peptide ligand, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, was abolished in the presence of selective inhibitors for G protein-coupled signaling and FPR ligand interaction. In addition, pretreatment of cells with inhibitors of ROS generation attenuated commensal bacteria-induced ERK signaling, indicating that ROS generation is required for ERK pathway activation. Bacterial colonization also led to oxidative inactivation of the redox-sensitive and ERK-specific phosphatase, DUSP3/VHR, and consequent stimulation of ERK pathway signaling.

Studies in germ-free mice reveal a slower turnover of intestinal epithelial cells with a marked decrease in crypt-to-villus transit time (8Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Science. 2001; 292: 1115-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Due to their therapeutic potential, commensal bacteria have also recently been used as oral supplements (probiotics) for the treatment of inflammatory and developmental disorders in the intestinal tract (9Pull S.L.

However, the mechanism by which the microbiota engage in cross-talk with the intestinal epithelia to mediate gut homeostatic events is not well understood. Bacteria signal to the intestinal epithelia through transmembrane or intracellular pattern recognition receptors, which recognize conserved bacterial structural motifs, known as microbial associated molecular patterns. A class of newly characterized epithelial pattern recognition receptors is the formyl peptide receptors (FPRs). 3The abbreviations used are: FPRformyl peptide receptorBoc2N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-Met-Leu-PheDPIdiphenyliodiniumDUSPdual-specific phosphatasefMLFN-formyl-Met-Leu-PheLGGLactobacillus rhamnosus GGNACN-acetylcysteineNOXNADPH oxidase enzymePTxpertussis toxinROSreactive oxygen speciesEdU5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine. FPRs are membrane-bound receptors that bind prokaryotic translation products modified with the bacteria-specific amino acid N-formyl methionine, N-formyl peptides, or fMLF (10Migeotte I. Communi D. Parmentier M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 501-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 11Rabiet M.J. Huet E. Boulay F.

Rev. 2009; 61: 119-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Ligand-bound FPRs undergo phosphorylation resulting in conformational changes that recruits the Gi family of G proteins. FPR activation within professional phagocytes initiates signaling pathways that (i) influence actin dynamics including chemotaxis, (ii) induce the transcription of inflammatory effectors and cytokines, and (iii) lead to the activation of NADPH oxidase enzymes that result in ROS production (respiratory burst). Recently, FPRs have been characterized on nonphagocyte cell types, including intestinal epithelia (13Babbin B.A. Jesaitis A.J. Ivanov A.I. Kelly D. Laukoetter M. Nava P. Parkos C.A. Nusrat A. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 8112-8121Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our research group has shown that commensal bacteria signal directly through FPRs to activate the MAPK ERK signaling pathway without promoting the proinflammatory IκB or proapoptotic JNK pathways (14Wentworth C.C.

Additionally, we have shown that commensal bacteria can down-regulate intestinal epithelial proinflammatory signaling through cellular ROS generation (6Kumar A. Wu H. Collier-Hyams L.S. Hansen J.M.

However, it is unknown whether epithelial cells generate FPR-dependent ROS production in response to fMLF recognition (analogous to events well known in phagocytes) or whether ROS plays a role in homeostatic signaling. formyl peptide receptor N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-Met-Leu-Phe diphenyliodinium dual-specific phosphatase N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG N-acetylcysteine NADPH oxidase enzyme pertussis toxin reactive oxygen species 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine. The physiological generation of ROS by nonphagocyte NADPH oxidase enzymes (NOXs) regulates diverse cellular processes through transient oxidative inactivation of catalytic cysteine residues on a spectrum of regulatory enzymes (15Forman H.J.

A well studied class of redox-sensitive regulatory enzymes is the dual specific phosphatases (DUSPs) (18Cerignoli F. Rahmouni S. Ronai Z. Mustelin T. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2210-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DUSPs are a subset of protein-tyrosine phosphatases that dephosphorylate threonine and tyrosine residues in the consensus motif Thr-Xaa-Tyr (where Xaa is Glu, Gly, or Pro) on MAPKs ERK, JNK, and p38. Once MAPKs are dephosphorylated, the signaling cascade becomes inactive. Conversely, when the DUSP catalytic cysteines are oxidatively inactivated through localized ROS production, DUSP phosphatase activity is reversibly inhibited, leading to sustained activation of MAPKs. Here, we show that a member of the commensal microbiota, and a bacterial product, activate FPR-dependent ROS generation in the intestinal epithelia and that generated ROS is sufficient to modulate ERK pathway signaling through the oxidative inactivation of DUSP3. These findings indicate that commensal bacteria induce ROS generation through intestinal FPRs and identify a mechanism by which the microbiota influence intestinal epithelial homeostatic signaling. H2O2 and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. MG-262 was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

Epithelial cells were treated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG; 5 × 107 cfu/ml) (ATCC 53103) or fMLF (500 nm) (Sigma-Aldrich) for the indicated times were washed with HBSS and incubated in the dark with 5 mm CM-H2DCF-DA (Molecular Probes) for an additional 5 min as described previously (6Kumar A.

To evaluate whether inhibitors of G protein-coupled receptors or FPRs could block observed ROS generation, cells were pretreated with NAC (20 mm), diphenyliodinium (DPI) (40 mm), PTx (1 μg/ml), or Boc2 (100 ng/ml) 30 min prior to LGG or fMLF treatment. All images were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510) at ×20 magnification. Images were captured using 488 nm laser for excitation and a 515–540 nm emission filter. Quantification of fluorescence intensity was determined using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) software with treatments at 30 min. For detection of ROS in mice, food and water of 6–8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were removed, then mice were anesthetized and injected intrarectally with hydrocyanine3 (7.5 μm) 1 h prior to administration of PBS, LGG, or fMLF for 7 min. Mice were euthanized, and tissues were removed for analysis. The colon was opened along the mesenteric border, placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and processed for confocal laser scanning microscopy at ×20 magnification. Images were captured using a 535 nm laser for excitation and 560 nm emission filter. Quantification of fluorescence intensity was determined using ImageJ software. Antibodies were obtained as follows: anti DUSP3, anti-myc, and phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich); and HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (19Collier-Hyams L.S. Zeng H. Sun J. Tomlinson A.D. Bao Z.Q. Chen H. Madara J.L. Orth K. Neish A.S. J.

Fluorescent images were acquired by laser confocal microscopy at ×63 magnification. Prior to the detection of endogenous DUSP3, cells were incubated with MG-262, a proteosome inhibitor. SK-CO15 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For luciferase reporter assays, cells were transfected with ERK-dependent Elk1 reporter plasmids (Luciferase Trans-Reporting Systems; Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following cell treatment, cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was determined using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Total RNA was extracted from either cultured SK-CO15 cells or colonic epithelial scrapings from three mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription reactions were performed using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen) and PCRs undertaken using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). Primers used for PCRs include 18 S (forward) 5′-gtaacccgttgaaccccatt-3′, 18 S (reverse) 5′-ccatccaatcggtagtagcg-3′, hDUSP3 (forward) 5′-taaaaaccccaccatttgga-3′, and hDUSP3 (reverse) 5′-cttcctgcttgtcttctgg-3′. DUSP3 gene expression was standardized against 18 S transcript levels in the same sample, and experimental results were recorded as -fold increase relative to measurements in PBS-treated samples. PCRs were performed in triplicate using two separate RNA preparations for each data point. The DUSP3 open reading frame was cloned into pCMV-myc to create pCMV-myc-DUSP3. A catalytically inactive form of DUSP3 was created (mDUSP3) where the cysteine residue at position 124 is replaced by an alanine which is reported to render DUSP3 catalytically inactive. DUSP3 redox state was monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift on 10% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Cell lysates were prepared using a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of β-mercaptoethanol and immunoblotted using myc or DUSP3 antibodies (Cell Signaling). All murine experimental procedures were undertaken according to the Emory University guidelines for ethical treatment of animals. For analysis of colonic tissue by intrarectal treatment, the food and water of 6–8-week-old B6 mice were removed 4 h prior to anesthetization, then intrarectal administration of PBS, LGG, or fMLF for 7 or 30 min. Mice were euthanized, and tissues were removed for analysis. The colon was opened along the mesenteric border and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and subsequent colon whole mounts were prepared as described below. For control experiments, mice were systemically administered 1 μg/ml PTx via intraperitoneal injection for 18 h prior to LGG treatment. For the fMLF peptidomimetic control, mice were intrarectally administered 100 μg/ml Boc2 through a soft catheter 30 min prior to LGG treatment. Dissected murine tissues were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and washed again. Samples were blocked in 5% normal goat serum for 1 h before incubation with rabbit anti-phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling) for 1 h at 37 °C (or overnight at 4 °C) and then with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). Cellular actin was stained with Alexa Fluor Phallodin-633 (Molecular Probes). Tissue was cut into 2-mm to 5-mm pieces, mounted on slides, and visualized by laser confocal microscopy at ×63 magnification. p values ≤ 0.05 using Student's t test were considered significant. The results of statistical analyses are given in the figure legends. fMLF is a classic inducer of FPR-dependent ROS generation in neutrophils (10Migeotte I. Communi D. Parmentier M.

We investigated the extent to which commensal bacteria or fMLF activated FPRs situated on the apical surface of epithelial cells and mediated an analogous ROS response. As a candidate commensal bacterium, we used LGG, a member of the human microbiota and commonly used probiotic agent. Polarized cultured SK-CO15 colonic epithelial cells were treated with either fMLF or LGG for up to 30 min, and ROS generation was detected by oxidation of the redox sensitive CM-H2DCF-DA dye as reported previously (6Kumar A. Wu H. Collier-Hyams L.S. Hansen J.M. Li T. Yamoah K. Pan Z.Q. Jones D.P. Neish A.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4457-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). ROS was rapidly generated in fMLF- or LGG-treated cells within 15 min of contact and peaked at 30 min (data past 30 min not shown) (Fig. 1A). We confirmed these results using another oxidation-sensitive dye, dihydroethidine and show that ROS generation is inhibited by the flavoprotein inhibitor DPI (supplemental Fig. 1). ROS was detected in the cytoplasm of contacted cells, whereas no ROS was evident in the nucleus. The levels of ROS generated by application of fMLF or LGG were comparable with those generated in response to contact with 250 μm H2O2 (supplemental Fig. 2). Importantly, both fMLF- and LGG-induced ROS generation was abrogated in cells pretreated with Boc2, a competitive inhibitor of fMLF binding to FPRs (21Gavins F.N. Yona S. Kamal A.M. Flower R.J. Perretti M. Blood. 2003; 101: 4140-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 22Babbin B.A. Lee W.Y. Parkos C.A. Winfree L.M. Akyildiz A. Perretti M. Nusrat A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1984; 39: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, pretreatment of the stimulated cells with NAC, a glutathione (GSH) precursor and ROS sink, also abrogated fMLF- and LGG-induced ROS generation. ROS was quantified by densitometry of panels in Fig. 1A (Fig. 1, B and C). To investigate whether commensal bacteria-induced ROS generation occurs in vivo, we pretreated mice with a newly developed redox-sensitive hydrocyanine dye that fluoresces when oxidized (24Kundu K. Knight S.F. Willett N. Lee S. Taylor W.R. Murthy N. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2009; 48: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Intrarectal administration of either LGG or fMLF rapidly induced ROS generation in colonic enterocytes (Fig. 1D). H&E or DNA staining of tissues similar to those analyzed for ROS generation show the colonic architecture of the examined areas (Fig. 1D). ROS generation detected in tissues shown in Fig. 1D was also quantified by densitometry (Fig. 1E). Consistent with responses seen in vitro, pretreatment of the murine colon with PTx, Boc, or NAC also inhibited LGG- or fMLF-induced ROS generation in vivo (Fig. 1E). Together, these data demonstrate that fMLF and LGG induce comparable physiological levels of FPR-dependent ROS generation in contacted cells. We reported previously that contact of the apical surface of enterocytes by commensal bacteria or fMLF specifically activated the ERK signaling pathway (14Wentworth C.C. Jones R.M. Kwon Y.M. Nusrat A. Neish A.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 177: 2782-2790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and here we confirm that L. rhamnosus or fMLF does not induce inflammatory cytokine production, whereas treatment of cultured cells with Salmonella or TNF potently induces high levels of IL-8 (supplemental Fig. 3). Having shown that enterocytes also generate ROS in response to contact by fMLF and LGG, we next investigated the extent to which physiological levels of ROS influenced ERK signaling. Cultured SK-CO15 cells were treated with NAC or the NADP(H) oxidase inhibitor, DPI, prior to treatment with LGG or fMLF. Strikingly, whereas ERK is rapidly phosphorylated in response to LGG of fMLF, no ERK phosphorylation was detected in NAC- or DPI-treated cells, indicating a function for ROS in LGG- or fMLF-induced ERK signaling (Fig. 2A). We also investigated ERK pathway activation in the presence of NAC using a transfection-based ERK pathway-dependent reporter assay. Consistent with the results from immunoblot analysis, pretreatment of cells with NAC inhibited LGG- or fMLF-induced ERK pathway-responsive transcriptional activation (Fig. 2B). Importantly, neither NAC nor DPI treatment inhibited TNF-α-induced JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that TNF-α-induced signaling is not ROS-dependent. We also reported previously that apical contact of polarized SK-CO15 cultured cells by LGG or fMLF induced cellular proliferation (14Wentworth C.C. Jones R.M. Kwon Y.M. Nusrat A. Neish A.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 177: 2782-2790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To determine whether ROS generated in response to contact by LGG and fMLF mediates these proliferative events, we assayed for EdU incorporation in cultured SK-CO15 cells pretreated with the antioxidant NAC before stimulation with either LGG or fMLF. We observed that antioxidant pretreatment significantly reduced the number of EdU-positive cells induced by LGG and fMLF cellular contact (Fig. 2, D and E), thus implicating a role for commensal bacteria-induced ROS generation in mediating cellular proliferation and/or homeostatic events in the gut. ROS has been shown to modulate cellular signaling events via the oxidation of hyperreactive cysteine residues within a subset of regulatory enzymes (15Forman H.J. Maiorino M. Ursini F. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). A well studied example is the family of MAPK phosphatases or DUSPs, which dephosphorylate MAPK tyrosine and threonine residues, thus rendering MAPKs inactive (18Cerignoli F. Rahmouni S. Ronai Z. Mustelin T. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2210-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Using microarray analysis, our research group showed previously that LGG treatment in the 2-week-old murine intestine induced the transcriptional up-regulation of DUSP3, which is known to specifically dephosphorylate ERK and thus inhibit ERK pathway signaling (25Lin P.W. Nasr T.R. Berardinelli A.J. Kumar A. Neish A.S. Pediatr. Res. 2008; 64: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As a first step toward understanding the relationship between LGG/fMLF and DUSP3, we confirmed DUSP3 up-regulation in treated SK-CO15 cells by both quantitative PCR analysis (Fig. 3A) and immunoblot detection for endogenous DUSP3 (Fig. 3B). We also confirmed these results in vivo by quantitative PCR and immunoblot analyses of intestinal scrapings from mice treated intrarectally with LGG or fMLF. Results confirm increased DUSP3 mRNA and total protein levels in LGG- and fMLF-treated murine colonic epithelium (Fig. 3, C and D). Together, these data indicate that intestinal epithelial DUSP3 is up-regulated in response to whole commensal bacteria or formyl peptides, concurrent with ERK phosphorylation and pathway stimulation, plausibly acting as a negative feedback loop for the down-regulation of ERK pathway signaling. Importantly, because DUSP proteins are sensitive to cellular redox levels, DUSP3 may be a target for ROS modulation of ERK signaling. We then sought to establish the mechanism by which LGG- or fMLF-induced cellular ROS influences ERK signaling circuitry. Thus far, we have established that ROS is generated within minutes of LGG or fMLF contact with epithelial cells and that ensuing events include the phosphorylation of the ERK and the up-regulation of ERK-responsive gene, DUSP3. Following pathway activation, DUSP3 is known to catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated ERK, serving as a negative feedback loop (18Cerignoli F. Rahmouni S. Ronai Z. Mustelin T. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2210-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Absent inducing stimuli, DUSP3 is expressed at basal levels that are sufficient to suppress overt ERK pathway activation. Importantly, the phosphatase activity of DUSP3 is dependent on a critical cysteine at position 124. This conserved residue within the DUSP family is readily oxidized in response to elevated cellular redox conditions, rendering DUSP proteins, including DUSP3, catalytically inactive and unable to suppress MAPK pathway activity (26Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that the rapid generation of ROS in response to LGG and fMLF contact leads to the oxidation and transient inactivation of DUSP3, thus facilitating ERK phosphorylation and pathway activation. To test this hypothesis, we transfected cultured SK-CO15 cells with plasmids harboring either wild-type DUSP3 or a catalytically inactive mutant form of DUSP3 (mDUSP3), where the critical cysteine residue at position 124 was replaced by serine, and assessed its ability to dephosphorylate ERK. Whereas wild-type DUSP3 potently repressed ERK phosphorylation markedly below basal levels, introduction of mDUSP3, presumably acting as a dominant negative, resulted in dramatically elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the immunoblot analysis, wild-type DUSP3 was effective in suppressing basal ERK pathway activity, whereas the mutant form served to augment ERK-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 4B). Next, we evaluated DUSP3 or mDUSP3 oxidation in response to elevated cellular ROS levels following treatment with LGG, fMLF, or H2O2 (control). The oxidation status of DUSP3 was examined by immunoblot analysis using nonreducing SDS-PAGE as described previously (26Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). These conditions allow detection of higher molecular mass disulfide dimer and aggregate forms. Untreated DUSP3 and mDUSP3 migrate at 20 kDa (Fig. 4C), whereas LGG, fMLF, H2O2 treatment resulted in a characteristic band shift indicative of rapid DUSP3 oxidation and formation of higher order aggregates (Fig. 4C). Importantly, no band shift was detected in lysates prepared from cells transfected with plasmids expressing mDUSP3, where the redox-sensitive cysteine 124 residue is mutated to serine. This confirms that the critical cysteine residue on DUSP3 required for its phosphatase activity is responsive to cellular ROS induced by bacterial products (Fig. 4C). These findings are further supported in studies where pretreatment of transfected cultured cells with NAC before treatment with LGG or fMLF markedly reduced the levels of oxidized DUSP3, thus indicating that DUSP3 oxidation is a direct result of LGG- and fMLF-induced ROS generation (Fig. 4C). In all cases, the appearance of oxidized forms of DUSP3 correlated with ERK phosphorylation, whereas mDUSP3 exhibited superbasal levels of ERK phosphorylation. Importantly, when the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol was added to treated cell lysates, all high molecular mass bands were abolished, indicating that the slow migrating forms are likely mixed disulfide bonds between DUSP3 and other cellular proteins (supplemental Fig. 4). Together, these data show that LGG- or fMLF-induced ROS generation modulates the dynamic interaction between DUSP3 and its target substrate, phosphorylated ERK. We previously reported that LGG or fMLF induced the phosphorylation of ERK in murine enterocytes (14Wentworth C.C. Jones R.M. Kwon Y.M. Nusrat A. Neish A.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 177: 2782-2790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To show that this activity is dependent on LGG- or fMLF-induced ROS generation in the murine colon, we pretreated mice intrarectally with NAC before stimulation with LGG or fMLF for 7 min. Strikingly, LGG- or fMLF-induced ERK phosphorylation was completely abrogated in the colonic epithelium of NAC-pretreated mice, compared with untreated control mice where ERK is phosphorylated within minutes of contact by LGG or fMLF (Fig. 5A). To corroborate these observations, colonic epithelial scrapings from these mice were examined by immunoblot analysis using an antibody specific for phosphorylated ERK. Consistent with the immunofluorescent analysis, NAC pretreatment markedly reduced LGG- and fMLF-induced phosphorylation of ERK compared with nonpretreated samples (Fig. 5B). Collectively, these data show that fMLF and LGG induce ERK via FPR-dependent redox modulation of DUSP3 in the murine colon. The intestinal mucosa has evolved mechanisms to perceive and respond to bacteria, including the resident microbiota and the occasional enteric pathogen. For example, microbe-induced signals from epithelial Toll-like receptors and intracytoplasmic Nod proteins are well known to mediate proinflammatory and cytoprotective cellular responses and are vital in the host defense against pathogens. In this work, we describe a mechanism by which commensal bacteria can stimulate important non-proinflammatory eukaryotic signaling pathways that influence proliferative or homeostatic pathways, rather than defense responses. We recently reported that epithelial cells can perceive commensal bacteria via FPRs located on the surface of epithelial cells (14Wentworth C.C. Jones R.M. Kwon Y.M. Nusrat A. Neish A.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 177: 2782-2790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a function that has been reported extensively in professional phagocytic cells. We also reported that ligand binding to FPRs in intestinal enterocytes induced the specific activation of ERK pathway signaling and stimulation of cellular proliferation (14Wentworth C.C. Jones R.M. Kwon Y.M. Nusrat A. Neish A.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 177: 2782-2790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, we assess whether other aspects of FPR-mediated signaling reported in phagocytes are also functionally important in epithelial cells. Previous reports by our research group showed that commensal bacteria and their soluble fermentation products stimulated ROS generation within intestinal epithelial cells (6Kumar A. Wu H. Collier-Hyams L.S. Hansen J.M. Li T. Yamoah K. Pan Z.Q. Jones D.P. Neish A.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4457-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 27Kumar A. Wu H. Collier-Hyams L.S. Kwon Y.M. Hanson J.M. Neish A.S. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This process may be analogous to the activation of high levels of ROS in professional phagocytes stimulated with FPR ligands (respiratory burst). The FPR-dependent respiratory burst in professional phagocytes is mediated via the gp91phox complex (NOX2) in response to microorganisms or formylated peptides. Colonic epithelial cells also express NOX1 and both DUOX proteins (28Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2467) Google Scholar). We thus speculated that ROS within epithelial cells may be generated via the same mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that commensal bacterial contact, or fMLF contact with cultured cells or in vivo epithelium, results in the FPR-dependent generation of ROS and that pharmacological inhibition of NADP(H) oxidase by DPI attenuates this response. These data identify NOX1 and/or DUOX as the enzymes that generate commensal bacteria-induced ROS in colonic epithelial cells. Additionally, we show that inhibition of ROS generation also inhibits commensal bacteria- or fMLF-induced phosphorylation of ERK. Together, these data implicate ROS in the signaling events that mediate commensal bacteria-induced ERK pathway signaling. The generation of ROS as a response to bacteria and their products is highly conserved and is widely represented in plants and lower metazoans (29Ha E.M. Oh C.T. Ryu J.H. Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Jang I.H. Brey P.T. Lee W.J. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 125-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 30Kotchoni S.O. Gachomo E.W. J. Biosci. 2006; 31: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 31Pauly N. Pucciariello C. Mandon K. Innocenti G. Jamet A. Baudouin E. Hérouart D. Frendo P. Puppo A. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 32Tanaka A. Christensen M.J. Takemoto D. Park P. Scott B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1052-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For example, plants purposefully generate intracellular ROS as signaling molecules to control various processes, including pathogen defense, programmed cell death, and stomatal behavior. Interestingly, in both plants and lower metazoans, ROS-producing enzymes and their regulation by GTPases appear to be evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for ROS generation (30Kotchoni S.O. Gachomo E.W. J. Biosci. 2006; 31: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is also thought that many ROS are short lived, highly localized molecules, with a small radius of action, which may allow for specific targeting of particular signaling pathways. ROS signaling is transduced by a subset of sensor enzymes that are transiently inactivated by reversible oxidation of catalytic cysteine residues within the active sites (33Reddie K.G. Carroll K.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Such enzymes include a variety of tyrosine phosphatases such as PTEN, antioxidants such as thioredoxins and peroxiredoxins, and members of the Ubc family of proteins (6Kumar A. Wu H. Collier-Hyams L.S. Hansen J.M. Li T. Yamoah K. Pan Z.Q. Jones D.P. Neish A.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4457-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Our laboratory established that bacterially elicited ROS transiently inactivate Ubc12, which normally neddylates the Cul1 subunit of the ubiquitin ligase complex targeting IκB-α for proteosomal degradation. With IκB-α no longer targeted for degradation, NF-κB remains trapped in the cytosol, unable to translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription of inflammatory mediators (6Kumar A. Wu H. Collier-Hyams L.S. Hansen J.M. Li T. Yamoah K. Pan Z.Q. Jones D.P. Neish A.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4457-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), resulting in inflammatory suppression. Additionally, we have shown commensal generated ROS augment cell motility by oxidative inactivation of the tyrosine phosphatases LMW-PTP and SHP-2, which are responsible for desphosphorylation of FAK, thus allowing sustained activation of FAK, formation of focal adhesions, and subsequent enhancement of in vitro and in vivo wound healing (34Swanson 2nd, P.A. Kumar A. Samarin S. Vijay-Kumar M. Kundu K. Murthy N. Hansen J. Nusrat A. Neish A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 8803-8808Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These studies represent a body of data directly implicating ROS as signaling molecules in intestinal homeostasis. Here, we show commensal-induced ROS is also crucial for sustaining ERK signaling and subsequent cellular proliferative events by modulating DUSP3 activity. DUSP3, also known as the human Vaccinia H1-related (VHR) phosphatase (35Guan K.L. Broyles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 36Liu K. Lemon B. Traktman P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7823-7834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a 185-amino acid (20-kDa) protein identified based on its homology with the Vaccinia virus H1 open reading frame. Recently, DUSP3 was shown to be important in the control of cell growth and differentiation (37Rahmouni S. Cerignoli F. Alonso A. Tsutji T. Henkens R. Zhu C. Louis-dit-Sully C. Moutschen M. Jiang W. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We show that commensal bacteria-induced generation of ROS can lead to the direct oxidative inactivation of DUSP3 enzymatic activity, thus relieving DUSP3-mediated suppression of ERK pathway signaling (Fig. 6). Together, our data identify a molecular mechanism by which commensal bacteria directly activate a homeostatic signaling pathway in the mammalian intestine. Characterization of the molecular mechanisms by which commensal bacteria mediate beneficial effects on health and disease is important for advancing the application of these microbes in preventative or therapeutic medical approaches. In fact, supplementation of the normal microbiota with exogenous bacteria, “probiotics,” has already been shown to result in promising therapeutic benefits. Specifically, probiotic therapy decreases inflammatory responses, augments barrier function, and increases epithelial proliferation (7Lin P.W. Myers L.E. Ray L. Song S.C. Nasr T.R. Berardinelli A.J. Kundu K. Murthy N. Hansen J.M. Neish A.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Probiotic preparations are clinically indicated for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and postsurgical pouchitis (38Hart A.L. Stagg A.J. Kamm M.A. J. Clin. Gastroenterol. 2003; 36: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 39Kruis W. Fric P. Pokrotnieks J. Lukás M. Fixa B. Kascák M. Kamm M.A. Weismueller J. Beglinger C. Stolte M. Wolff C.

Res. 2008; 64: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Additionally, abnormal composition of the microbiota, “dysbiotic flora,” is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and potentially other systemic immune disorders. We show that some of the beneficial effects attributed to probiotics, and of a normal microbiota, are potentiated by FPR-dependent and ROS-mediated modulation of cellular signaling pathways. Characterization of FPRs as receptors that mediate commensal bacterial signaling to intestinal epithelial cells, as well as identifying the signal pathways within intestinal epithelial cells that are modified by commensal bacteria, will contribute to a better understanding of the symbiotic role of the microbiota and the potential benefits of probiotics.

https://openalex.org/W1985325673,"Methylation and demethylation of DNA are the complementary processes of epigenetic regulation. These two types of regulation influence a diverse array of cellular activities, including the maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells. It was generally believed that DNA demethylation occurs passively over several cycles of DNA replication and that active DNA demethylation is rare. Recently, evidence for active DNA demethylation has been obtained in several cancer, neuronal, and embryonic stem cell lines. Studies in embryonic stem cell models, however, suggested that active DNA demethylation might be restricted to the early development of progenitor cells. Whether active demethylation is involved in terminal differentiation of adult stem cells is poorly understood. We provide evidence that active DNA demethylation does occur during terminal specification of stem cells in an adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell-derived osteogenic differentiation model. The medium CpG regions in promoters of the Dlx5, Runx2, Bglap, and Osterix osteogenic lineage-specific genes were demethylated during the increase in gene expression associated with osteogenic differentiation. The growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD45A was up-regulated in these processes. Knockdown of GADD45A led to hypermethylation of Dlx5, Runx2, Bglap, and Osterix promoters, followed by suppression of the expression of these genes and interruption of osteogenic differentiation. These results reveal that GADD45A plays an essential role in gene-specific active DNA demethylation during adult stem cell differentiation. They enhance the current knowledge of osteogenic specification and may also lead to a better understanding of the common mechanisms underlying epigenetic regulation in adult stem cell differentiation."

We compare different properties of natural and recombinant versions of Ara h 1, a major peanut allergen, through structural, immunologic, and bioinformatics analyses. Small angle x-ray scattering studies show that natural Ara h 1 forms higher molecular weight aggregates in solution. In contrast, the full-length recombinant protein is partially unfolded and exists as a monomer. The crystal structure of the Ara h 1 core (residues 170-586) shows that the central part of the allergen has a bicupin fold, which is in agreement with our bioinformatics analysis. In its crystalline state, the core region of Ara h 1 forms trimeric assemblies, while in solution the protein exists as higher molecular weight assemblies. This finding reveals that the residues forming the core region of the protein are sufficient for formation of Ara h 1 trimers and higher order oligomers. Natural and recombinant variants of proteins tested in in vitro gastric and duodenal digestion assays show that the natural protein is the most stable form, followed by the recombinant Ara h 1 core fragment and the full-length recombinant protein. Additionally, IgE binding studies reveal that the natural and recombinant allergens have different patterns of interaction with IgE antibodies. The molecular basis of cross-reactivity between vicilin allergens is also elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1972594681,"The antitumor activities of the novel adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator, OSU-53, were assessed in in vitro and in vivo models of triple-negative breast cancer. OSU-53 directly stimulated recombinant AMPK kinase activity (EC50, 0.3 μm) and inhibited the viability and clonogenic growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells with equal potency (IC50, 5 and 2 μm, respectively) despite lack of LKB1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. Nonmalignant MCF-10A cells, however, were unaffected. Beyond AMPK-mediated effects on mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and lipogenesis, OSU-53 also targeted multiple AMPK downstream pathways. Among these, the protein phosphatase 2A-dependent dephosphorylation of Akt is noteworthy because it circumvents the feedback activation of Akt that results from mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition. OSU-53 also modulated energy homeostasis by suppressing fatty acid biosynthesis and shifting the metabolism to oxidation by up-regulating the expression of key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, such as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α and the transcription factor nuclear respiratory factor 1. Moreover, OSU-53 suppressed LPS-induced IL-6 production, thereby blocking subsequent Stat3 activation, and inhibited hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in association with the silencing of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a and the E-cadherin repressor Snail. In MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice, daily oral administration of OSU-53 (50 and 100 mg/kg) suppressed tumor growth by 47–49% and modulated relevant intratumoral biomarkers of drug activity. However, OSU-53 also induced protective autophagy that attenuated its antiproliferative potency. Accordingly, cotreatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine increased the in vivo tumor-suppressive activity of OSU-53. OSU-53 is a potent, orally bioavailable AMPK activator that acts through a broad spectrum of antitumor activities."

The high light treatment of the wild type and stn8 caused specific increase in phosphorylation of Lhcb4.1 and Lhcb4.2 isoforms of the PSII linker protein CP29 at five different threonine residues. Phosphorylation of CP29 at four of these residues was not found in stn7 and stn7stn8 plants lacking the STN7 protein kinase. Blue native gel electrophoresis followed by immunological and mass spectrometric analyses of the membrane protein complexes revealed that the high light treatment of the wild type caused redistribution of CP29 from PSII supercomplexes to PSII dimers and monomers. A similar high-light-induced disassembly of the PSII supercomplexes occurred in stn8, but not in stn7 and stn7stn8. Transfer of the high-light-treated wild type plants to normal light relocated CP29 back to PSII supercomplexes. We postulate that disassembly of PSII supercomplexes in plants exposed to high light involves STN7-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of the linker protein CP29. Disruption of this adaptive mechanism can explain dramatically retarded growth of the stn7 and stn7stn8 mutants under fluctuating normal/high light conditions, as previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W2083972323,"Background During a normal cell cycle, the transition from G2 phase to mitotic phase is triggered by the activation of the cyclin B1-dependent Cdc2 kinase. Here we report our finding that treatment of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells with nocodazole, a prototypic microtubule inhibitor, results in strong up-regulation of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels, and their increases are required for the development of mitotic prometaphase arrest and characteristic phenotypes. Methodology/Principal Findings It was observed that there was a time-dependent early increase in cyclin B1 and Cdc2 protein levels (peaking between 12 and 24 h post treatment), and their levels started to decline after the initial increase. This early up-regulation of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 closely matched in timing the nocodazole-induced mitotic prometaphase arrest. Selective knockdown of cyclin B1or Cdc2 each abrogated nocodazole-induced accumulation of prometaphase cells. The nocodazole-induced prometaphase arrest was also abrogated by pre-treatment of cells with roscovitine, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, or with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor that was found to suppress cyclin B1 and Cdc2 up-regulation. In addition, we found that MAD2 knockdown abrogated nocodazole-induced accumulation of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 proteins, which was accompanied by an attenuation of nocodazole-induced prometaphase arrest. Conclusions/Significance These observations demonstrate that the strong early up-regulation of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 contributes critically to the rapid and selective accumulation of prometaphase-arrested cells, a phenomenon associated with exposure to microtubule inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2034649260,"Pathogens must steal iron from their hosts to establish infection. In mammals, hemoglobin (Hb) represents the largest reservoir of iron, and pathogens express Hb-binding proteins to access this source. Here, we show how one of the commonest and most significant human pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, captures Hb as the first step of an iron-scavenging pathway. The x-ray crystal structure of Hb bound to a domain from the Isd (iron-regulated surface determinant) protein, IsdH, is the first structure of a Hb capture complex to be determined. Surface mutations in Hb that reduce binding to the Hb-receptor limit the capacity of S. aureus to utilize Hb as an iron source, suggesting that Hb sequence is a factor in host susceptibility to infection. The demonstration that pathogens make highly specific recognition complexes with Hb raises the possibility of developing inhibitors of Hb binding as antibacterial agents."
https://openalex.org/W2099819879,"Background ABA-, stress- and ripening-induced (ASR) proteins have been reported to act as a downstream component involved in ABA signal transduction. Although much attention has been paid to the roles of ASR in plant development and stress responses, the mechanisms by which ABA regulate fruit ripening at the molecular level are not fully understood. In the present work, a strawberry ASR gene was isolated and characterized (FaASR), and a polyclonal antibody against FaASR protein was prepared. Furthermore, the effects of ABA, applied to two different developmental stages of strawberry, on fruit ripening and the expression of FaASR at transcriptional and translational levels were investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings FaASR, localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, contained 193 amino acids and shared common features with other plant ASRs. It also functioned as a transcriptional activator in yeast with trans-activation activity in the N-terminus. During strawberry fruit development, endogenous ABA content, levels of FaASR mRNA and protein increased significantly at the initiation of ripening at a white (W) fruit developmental stage. More importantly, application of exogenous ABA to large green (LG) fruit and W fruit markedly increased endogenous ABA content, accelerated fruit ripening, and greatly enhanced the expression of FaASR transcripts and the accumulation of FaASR protein simultaneously. Conclusions These results indicate that FaASR may be involved in strawberry fruit ripening. The observed increase in endogenous ABA content, and enhanced FaASR expression at transcriptional and translational levels in response to ABA treatment might partially contribute to the acceleration of strawberry fruit ripening."

In less massive stars2 such as the Sun, convection transports mass and energy through the outer 30 per cent of the star and excites a rich spectrum of resonant acoustic modes. Based on the solar example, with no firm theoretical basis, models predict that the convective envelope in δ Sct stars extends only about 1 per cent of the radius3, but with sufficient energy to excite solar-like oscillations4,5. This was not observed before the Kepler mission6, so the presence of a convective envelope in the models has been questioned. Here we report the detection of solar-like oscillations in the δ Sct star HD 187547, implying that surface convection operates efficiently in stars about twice as massive as the Sun, as the ad hoc models predicted."

The crystal structure of full-length NP was solved at a resolution of 2.45 Å. The overall fold corresponds to that of NP of LASV strain Josiah (Qi, X., Lan, S., Wang, W., Schelde, L. M., Dong, H., Wallat, G. D., Ly, H., Liang, Y., and Dong, C. (2010) Nature 468, 779-783) with a root mean square deviation of 0.67 Å for all atoms (6.3% difference in primary sequence). As the packing in the crystal offers two different trimer architectures for the biological assembly, the quaternary structure of NP in solution was determined by small-angle x-ray scattering and EM. After classification and averaging of >6000 EM raw images, trimeric centrosymmetric structures were obtained, which correspond in size and shape to one trimer in the crystal structure formed around a crystallographic 3-fold rotation axis (symmetric trimer). The symmetric trimer is also a good model for the small-angle x-ray scattering data and could be well embedded into the ab initio model. The N-terminal domain of NP contains a deep nucleotide-binding cavity that has been proposed to bind cellular cap structures for priming viral mRNA synthesis. All residues implicated in m(7)GpppN binding were exchanged, and the transcription/replication phenotype of the NP mutant was tested using a LASV replicon system. None of the mutants showed a specific defect in mRNA expression; most were globally defective in RNA synthesis. In conclusion, we describe the full-length crystal structure and the quaternary structure in solution of LASV NP. The nucleotide-binding pocket of NP could not be assigned a specific role in viral mRNA synthesis."

We identified genes regulated by Yap5 in response to iron and show that one of the genes induced is TYW1, which encodes an iron-sulfur cluster enzyme that participates in the synthesis of wybutosine-modified tRNA. Strains deleted for TYW1 do not show a phenotype in standard yeast medium. In contrast, overexpression of TYW1 results in decreased cell growth and induction of the iron regulon, leading to increased expression of the high affinity iron transporters. We identified a minimal domain of S. cerevisiae Tyw1 that is sufficient to induce the iron regulon. CCC1, a vacuolar iron importer, is a Yap5-regulated gene, and deletion of either CCC1 or YAP5 resulted in high iron sensitivity. Deletion of TYW1 in a Δccc1 strain led to increased iron sensitivity. The increased iron sensitivity of Δccc1Δtyw1 could be suppressed by overexpression of iron-sulfur cluster enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W1974047047,"Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a protein implicated in diverse cellular functions, including exocytosis, DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. It was recently proposed to be involved in RNA metabolism because it was shown to associate with some cellular mRNA. Here, we identified ANXA2 as a RNA binding protein (RBP) that binds IBV (Infectious Bronchitis Virus) pseudoknot RNA. We first confirmed the binding of ANXA2 to IBV pseudoknot RNA by ultraviolet crosslinking and showed its binding to RNA pseudoknot with ANXA2 protein in vitro and in the cells. Since the RNA pseudoknot located in the frameshifting region of IBV was used as bait for cellular RBPs, we tested whether ANXA2 could regulate the frameshfting of IBV pseudoknot RNA by dual luciferase assay. Overexpression of ANXA2 significantly reduced the frameshifting efficiency from IBV pseudoknot RNA and knockdown of the protein strikingly increased the frameshifting efficiency. The results suggest that ANXA2 is a cellular RBP that can modulate the frameshifting efficiency of viral RNA, enabling it to act as an anti-viral cellular protein, and hinting at roles in RNA metabolism for other cellular mRNAs."

High levels of PP5 have been observed in human cancers, and constitutive PP5 overexpression aids tumor progression in mouse models of tumor development. However, PP5 is highly conserved among species, and the roles of PP5 in normal tissues are not clear. Here, to help evaluate the biological actions of PP5, a Cre/loxP-conditional mouse line was generated. In marked contrast to the early embryonic lethality associated with the genetic disruption of other PPP family phosphatases (e.g. PP2A and PP4), intercrosses with mouse lines that ubiquitously express Cre recombinase starting early in development (e.g. MeuCre40 and ACTB-Cre) produced viable and fertile PP5-deficient mice. Phenotypic differences caused by the total disruption of PP5 were minor, suggesting that small molecule inhibitors of PP5 will not have widespread systemic toxicity. Examination of roles for PP5 in fibroblasts generated from PP5-deficient embryos (PP5−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts) confirmed some known roles and identified new actions for PP5. PP5−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated increased sensitivity to UV light, hydroxyurea, and camptothecin, which are known activators of ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related) kinase. Further study revealed a previously unrecognized role for PP5 downstream of ATR activation in a UV light-induced response.

IntroductionThe genome of all living cells is attacked relentlessly by both reactive by-products of normal metabolism and environmental mutagens. Accordingly, all cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to maintain genomic fidelity. One, the DNA damage response, is a signal transduction network that is dependent upon reversible phosphorylation and functions to regulate cell cycle transition, DNA replication, DNA repair, and apoptosis (for review see Refs. 1Reinhardt H.C. Yaffe M.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar and 2Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). In response to genomic damage caused by reactive oxygen species, UV light, chemicals, or ionizing radiation, three PI3K-related protein kinases, ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated), ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related), and DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent proteins kinase catalytic subunit) become activated (3Xu Y. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 4Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar, 5Smits V.A. Warmerdam D.O.

Via elaborate mechanisms, these kinases phosphorylate proteins that help initiate and coordinate: 1) the recruitment of repair proteins to damaged DNA, 2) the suppression of cell cycle progression while repairs are in progress, and 3) the induction of apoptosis when damage cannot be adequately repaired. Other Ser/Thr kinases (e.g. ASK1 (apoptosis signaling kinase 1), Chk1 (checkpoint kinase Chk1), and JNK) together with transcription factors (notably the p53 tumor suppressor protein) help coordinate cell cycle arrest and progression into apoptosis (6Lovejoy C.A. Cortez D. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To allow a dynamic response in which cells that have made sufficient repairs can resume DNA replication and continue cell cycle progression, Ser/Thr protein phosphatases are needed to counter the kinases that initiate and maintain the DNA damage response. Currently, the roles of individual protein phosphatases are not well understood.PP5 is an okadaic acid/cantharidin/microcystin-sensitive member of the PPP family of Ser/Thr phosphatases, which also includes PP1, PP2A, PP4, and PP6 (7Swingle M.

Together, these observations suggest that PP5 may play an underappreciated role in the regulation of signaling networks that allow a cell to respond appropriately to genomic damage.The high conservation of PP5 among species (mouse, rabbit, bovine, and human PP5 protein share >98% identity) suggests that the actions of PP5 are conserved in mammals. Here, to help identify specific actions of PP5, we generated a PP5-Cre/loxP-conditional mouse line. When animals expressing the Cre/loxP-conditional allele of PP5 were crossed with the MeuCre40 line, viable PP5−/− offspring were produced. Mating with a second mouse strain (ACTB-Cre), in which the Cre recombinase is under the human β-actin gene promoter and expressed in all cells of the embryo by the blastocyst stage, also produced viable PP5-deficient mice. After fully backcrossing (F10-F12) the PP5−/− mice on the C57BL/6J background, studies conducted with PP5−/− mice and embryonic fibroblasts generated from PP5−/− mice (PP5−/− MEFs) 3The abbreviations used are: MEFmouse embryonic fibroblastESembryonic stemNeoneomycinANOVAanalysis of variance. reveal insight into the roles of PP5 in cellular responses to damage produced by UV light.DISCUSSIONWe have produced a Cre/loxP-conditional mouse line to help evaluate the roles of Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 5 (PP5). Intercrosses with lines (i.e. MeuCre40 and ACTB-Cre) that express the Cre recombinase during early embryonic development (31Leneuve P. Colnot S. Hamard G. Francis F. Niwa-Kawakita M. Giovannini M. Holzenberger M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Lewandoski M. Meyers E.N. Martin G.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1997; 62: 159-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) produced PP5-deficient mice that were viable and fertile, demonstrating that PP5 is not necessary for survival. After backcrossing on the C57BL/6J background, minor phenotypic differences between PP5+/+ and PP5−/− mice that were not noticed in preliminary studies conducted with (F2/N2) PP5-disrupted mice became apparent (Table 1 and Fig. 3). The under-representation of PP5−/− live births from PP5+/− heterozygous intercrosses and the small litter size of PP5−/− homozygous intercrosses indicate that PP5 provides a slight advantage during embryonic development. A decrease in the weight of male PP5−/− mice that became significant after 2 months of age was also observed, and autopsies of mice at the age of 1 year revealed splenomegaly in female PP5−/− animals. At this time, it is not clear how the disruption of PP5 contributes to these observations.Previous studies conducted with human cells, employing siRNA or antisense oligonucleotides to suppress PP5 protein levels, indicate that PP5 participates in the regulation of checkpoint signaling mechanisms that allow a cell to respond appropriately following exposure to ionizing radiation, reactive oxygen species, genotoxic chemicals, and UV light (for review see Ref. 14Golden T. Swingle M. Honkanen R.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In response to ionizing radiation, PP5 interacts with ATM, and initial studies with F2/N2 backcrossed PP5−/− mice confirmed many of the proposed roles for PP5 in ATM signaling previously identified in human cells with antisense oligonucleotides targeting PP5 (23Ali A. Zhang J. Bao S. Liu I. Otterness D. Dean N.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Yong W. Bao S. Chen H. Li D. Sánchez E.R. Shou W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14690-14694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).In cultured human cells, PP5 has been reported to be required for ATR-mediated checkpoint activation. Following UV irradiation, PP5 associates with ATR in both cancer and noncancer cell lines (22Zhang J. Bao S. Furumai R. Kucera K.S. Ali A. Dean N.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9910-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and in cancer cells (i.e. A549 and HeLa) the suppression of PP5 does not affect ATR association at sites of DNA damage or the interaction of ATR with ATRIP (22Zhang J. Bao S. Furumai R. Kucera K.S. Ali A. Dean N.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9910-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our observations are consistent with these previously reported studies. However, the development of viable and fertile PP5-deficient mice indicates that not all aspects of ATR signaling are dependent on PP5, because ATR deletion in mice results in embryonic lethality (4Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar) and Cre-mediated deletion of ATR in tissues of adult mice produces marked phenotypes that are not observed in the PP5−/− mice (37Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).Therefore, we examined the role of PP5 in UV light-induced signaling in more detail. ATR activation has broad cellular effects that help slow cell cycle progression, affect replication fork stability, and help regulate fork restart. Dose-response studies using MEFs from littermate PP5−/− or PP5+/+ mice exposed to UV light (which damages DNA), camptothecin (which arrests S phase replication via the inhibition DNA topoisomerase activity), or hydroxyurea (which arrests replication and damages DNA) revealed that PP5−/− MEFs are more sensitive to all three treatments that are all known to activate ATR. This observation is consistent with the increased sensitivity to stress-induced apoptosis produced by siRNA or antisense oligonucleotide-mediated suppression of PP5 in human cells (14Golden T. Swingle M. Honkanen R.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Zhou G. Golden T. Aragon I.V. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and suggests that PP5 may act to help suppress pathways leading to death, while the damage is assessed and repaired. However, other agents that damage DNA and arrest cell cycle progression (i.e. cisplatin; supplemental Fig. S4) demonstrated equal potency in both the wild-type and PP5-deficient MEFs, suggesting that PP5 does not directly act on apoptotic mechanisms. In addition, we observed no evidence that ATR activation was prevented in the PP5−/− MEFs. For example, UV light-induced phosphorylation of Rad17 at Ser-645, which is dependent on ATR (42Post S. Weng Y.C. Cimprich K. Chen L.B. Xu Y. Lee E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13102-13107Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), was observed in the PP5−/− MEFs (supplemental Fig. S5). Therefore, we next examined events downstream of ATR activation.In response to UV light, ATR phosphorylates Chk1 (at both Ser-317 and Ser-345), which activates the kinase activity of Chk1 (5Smits V.A.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25207-25217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In turn, Chk1 phosphorylates p53 (at Ser-15/18). Chk1 also phosphorylates Cdc25A, leading to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and a prolonged cell cycle (40Xiao Z. Chen Z. Gunasekera A.H. Sowin T.J. Rosenberg S.H. Fesik S. Zhang H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7488-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). ATR can also directly phosphorylate p53 at Ser-15/18, which has been implicated in the control of both cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (37Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 48Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Dose-response studies revealed that in PP5−/− cells UV-induced Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser-345 was both enhanced and prolonged. Without UV light exposure, increased basal Ser-345 phosphorylation was not observed, and the lack of PP5 did not prevent Chk1 from returning to a basal state of low phosphorylation by 24 h. Caffeine, at a concentration sufficient to inhibit the kinase activity of both ATR and ATM, effectively suppressed Chk1 Ser-345 phosphorylation in response to UV light in both the PP5+/+ and PP5−/− MEFs. Cdc25A degradation, which represents a hallmark of ATR-mediated Chk1 activation, was also more pronounced in the PP5−/− MEFs, as compared with the PP5+/+ controls. In HeLa cells, the suppression of PP5 but not PP1γ1 produced a prolonged phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser-345. Together, these observations refine the role of PP5 in UV light-induced response originally proposed by Zhang et al. (22Zhang J. Bao S. Furumai R. Kucera K.S. Ali A. Dean N.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9910-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), placing PP5 downstream of ATR and upstream of Chk1. This may indicate that the elevated levels of PP5 observed in some human cancers may contribute to tumor development by inducing a compensatory mechanism that counters the specific action of ATR. Still, the observation that Chk1 (Ser-345) phosphorylation returns to normal levels in the PP5−/− MEFs after 24 h indicates that PP5 is not the only phosphatase that acts on Chk1 at Ser-345. This observation is supported by elegant studies that indicate that Chk1 phosphorylation by ATR can also be regulated by PP2A, with PP2A acting in a ATR-Chk1-PP2A regulatory circuit that functions to keep Chk1 in a low activity state during an unperturbed cell division cycle while allowing Chk1 to remain primed to rapidly respond to genomic stress (41Leung-Pineda V. Ryan C.E. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 7529-7538Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Our data support and build upon this model, suggesting that PP5 acts as a governor of this Chk1 (Ser-345) phosphorylation-dependent circuit, acting to dampen, rather than prevent, spikes in Chk1 activity produced by genomic damage. This may help cells gauge the magnitude of the DNA damage. Alternatively, PP5 has been reported to be capable of interacting with a PP2AA/PP2Ac/PP2Ab53 heterotrimer (49Lubert E.J. Hong Y. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38582-38587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and our data cannot exclude the possibility that PP5 is affecting one or a subset of the >20 holoenzymes that share the same PP2AA/PP2Ac scaffold/catalytic components.The relationship between PP5 and p53 is less clear. Our studies revealed that the genetic disruption of PP5 is associated with increased p53 protein levels and enhanced p53 phosphorylation (at Ser-18; equivalent to Ser-15 in humans). In response to UV treatment, p53 accumulates and becomes hyperphosphorylated at Ser-18 in the PP5−/− MEFs. The same observations have been made in human cells using antisense oligonucleotides to suppress the expression of PP5, where changes in the phosphorylation at other sites (i.e. Ser-6, Ser-37, and Ser-392; human numbering) were also not observed (33Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Unlike Chk1 (Ser-345) phosphorylation, caffeine suppressed some, but not all, p53 phosphorylation at Ser-18, and both Ser-18 phosphorylation and p53 protein levels were elevated in the PP5−/− MEFs prior to treatment with UV light. This suggests that, in addition to suppressing Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of p53 (Ser-18), PP5 may also acts to suppress a second pathway leading to Ser-18 phosphorylation and increased p53 protein levels. Because many convergent pathways control p53 (Ser-15/18) phosphorylation, substantial future effort will be needed to determine precisely how PP5 affects p53 signaling. In addition, it should also be noted that to maintain the PP5−/− MEFs in culture, they were transfected with the SV40 large T-antigen. SV40 large T-antigen evolved to bind and inactivate p53, preventing apoptosis in virally infected cells. The observations made are not likely due to SV40 large T-antigen alone, because littermate control MEFs were also SV40 large T-antigen transformed and treated in an identical manner. In addition, similar observations were made using antisense oligonucleotides to suppress PP5 expression in human cell lines that were not SV40-tranformed (33Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Still, at this time our data does not rule out the possibility that PP5, via a currently obscure mechanism, affects SV40 large T-antigen suppression of a p53 response. IntroductionThe genome of all living cells is attacked relentlessly by both reactive by-products of normal metabolism and environmental mutagens. Accordingly, all cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to maintain genomic fidelity. One, the DNA damage response, is a signal transduction network that is dependent upon reversible phosphorylation and functions to regulate cell cycle transition, DNA replication, DNA repair, and apoptosis (for review see Refs. 1Reinhardt H.C. Yaffe M.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar and 2Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). In response to genomic damage caused by reactive oxygen species, UV light, chemicals, or ionizing radiation, three PI3K-related protein kinases, ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated), ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related), and DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent proteins kinase catalytic subunit) become activated (3Xu Y. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 4Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar, 5Smits V.A. Warmerdam D.O. Martin Y. Freire R. Front. Biosci. 2010; 15: 840-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Lovejoy C.A. Cortez D. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Via elaborate mechanisms, these kinases phosphorylate proteins that help initiate and coordinate: 1) the recruitment of repair proteins to damaged DNA, 2) the suppression of cell cycle progression while repairs are in progress, and 3) the induction of apoptosis when damage cannot be adequately repaired. Other Ser/Thr kinases (e.g. ASK1 (apoptosis signaling kinase 1), Chk1 (checkpoint kinase Chk1), and JNK) together with transcription factors (notably the p53 tumor suppressor protein) help coordinate cell cycle arrest and progression into apoptosis (6Lovejoy C.A. Cortez D. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To allow a dynamic response in which cells that have made sufficient repairs can resume DNA replication and continue cell cycle progression, Ser/Thr protein phosphatases are needed to counter the kinases that initiate and maintain the DNA damage response. Currently, the roles of individual protein phosphatases are not well understood.PP5 is an okadaic acid/cantharidin/microcystin-sensitive member of the PPP family of Ser/Thr phosphatases, which also includes PP1, PP2A, PP4, and PP6 (7Swingle M.

Together, these observations suggest that PP5 may play an underappreciated role in the regulation of signaling networks that allow a cell to respond appropriately to genomic damage.The high conservation of PP5 among species (mouse, rabbit, bovine, and human PP5 protein share >98% identity) suggests that the actions of PP5 are conserved in mammals.

https://openalex.org/W1987962752,"Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) frequently complicates shock, renal transplantation and cardiac and aortic surgery, and has prognostic significance. The translocation of phosphatidylserines to cell surfaces is an important pro-inflammatory signal for cell-stress after IRI. We hypothesized that shielding of exposed phosphatidylserines by the annexin A5 (ANXA5) homodimer Diannexin protects against renal IRI. Protective effects of Diannexin on the kidney were studied in a mouse model of mild renal IRI. Diannexin treatment before renal IRI decreased proximal tubule damage and leukocyte influx, decreased transcription and expression of renal injury markers Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin and Kidney Injury Molecule-1 and improved renal function. A mouse model of ischemic hind limb exercise was used to assess Diannexin biodistribution and targeting. When comparing its biodistribution and elimination to ANXA5, Diannexin was found to have a distinct distribution pattern and longer blood half-life. Diannexin targeted specifically to the ischemic muscle and its affinity exceeded that of ANXA5. Targeting of both proteins was inhibited by pre-treatment with unlabeled ANXA5, suggesting that Diannexin targets specifically to ischemic tissues via phosphatidylserine-binding. This study emphasizes the importance of phosphatidylserine translocation in the pathophysiology of IRI. We show for the first time that Diannexin protects against renal IRI, making it a promising therapeutic tool to prevent IRI in a clinical setting. Our results indicate that Diannexin is a potential new imaging agent for the study of phosphatidylserine-exposing organs in vivo."

Indeed, the potential effects of these insect viruses on the immune responses of mammals are only just beginning to be studied. We show in this paper that a recombinant Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus carrying a fragment of ovalbumin (OVA) on the VP39 capsid protein (BV-OVA) has the capacity to act as an adjuvant and vector of antigens in mice, thereby promoting specific CD4 and cytotoxic T cell responses against OVA. BV also induced in vivo maturation of dendritic cells and the production of inflammatory cytokines, thus promoting innate and adaptive immune responses. The OVA-specific response induced by BV-OVA was strong enough to reject a challenge with OVA-expressing melanoma cells (MO5 cells) and effectively prolonged survival of MO5 bearing mice. All these findings, together with the absence of pre-existing immunity to BV in humans and the lack of viral gene expression in mammalian cells, make BV a candidate for vaccination."

In industrialized countries about 20% of all femoral fractures occur in care dependent persons living in nursing care and assisted living facilities. Preventive strategies for these groups are needed as the access to medical services differs from independent home dwelling older persons at risk of osteoporotic fractures. It was the objective of the study to evaluate the effect of a fall and fracture prevention program on the incidence of femoral fracture in nursing homes in Bavaria, Germany.In a translational intervention study a fall prevention program was introduced in 256 nursing homes with 13,653 residents. The control group consisted of 893 nursing homes with 31,668 residents. The intervention consisted of staff education on fall and fracture prevention strategies, progressive strength and balance training, and on institutional advice on environmental adaptations. Incident femoral fractures served as outcome measure.In the years before the intervention risk of a femoral fracture did not differ between the intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). During the one-year intervention period femoral fracture rates were 33.6 (IG) and 41.0/1000 person years (CG), respectively. The adjusted relative risk of a femoral fracture was 0.82 (95% CI 0.72-0.93) in residents exposed to the fall and fracture prevention program compared to residents from CG.The state-wide dissemination of a multi-factorial fall and fracture prevention program was able to reduce femoral fractures in residents of nursing homes."

https://openalex.org/W2001161463,"The Gli proteins are the transcriptional effectors of the mammalian Hedgehog signaling pathway. In an unusual mechanism, the proteasome partially degrades or processes Gli3 in the absence of Hedgehog pathway stimulation to create a Gli3 fragment that opposes the activity of the full-length protein. In contrast, Gli1 is not processed but degraded completely, despite considerable homology with Gli3. We found that these differences in processing can be described by defining a processing signal that is composed of three parts: the zinc finger domain, an adjacent linker sequence, and a degron. Gli3 processing is inhibited when any one component of the processing signal is disrupted. We show that the zinc fingers are required for processing only as a folded structure and that the location but not the identity of the processing degron is critical. Within the linker sequence, regions of low sequence complexity play a crucial role, but other sequence features are also important. Gli1 is not processed because two components of the processing signal, the linker sequence and the degron, are ineffective. These findings provide new insights into the molecular elements that regulate Gli protein processing by the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W2048290379,"Background Plant bioreactor offers an efficient and economical system for large-scale production of recombinant proteins. However, high cost and difficulty in scaling-up of downstream purification of the target protein, particularly the common involvement of affinity chromatography and protease in the purification process, has hampered its industrial scale application, therefore a cost-effective and easily scale-up purification method is highly desirable for further development of plant bioreactor. Methodology/Principal Findings To tackle this problem, we investigated the ELP-intein coupling system for purification of recombinant proteins expressed in transgenic plants using a plant lectin (PAL) with anti-tumor bioactivity as example target protein and rice seeds as production platform. Results showed that ELP-intein-PAL (EiP) fusion protein formed novel irregular ER-derived protein bodies in endosperm cells by retention of endogenous prolamins. The fusion protein was partially self-cleaved in vivo, but only self-cleaved PAL protein was detected in total seed protein sample and deposited in protein storage vacuoles (PSV). The in vivo uncleaved EiP protein was accumulated up to 2–4.2% of the total seed protein. The target PAL protein could be purified by the ELP-intein system efficiently without using complicated instruments and expensive chemicals, and the yield of pure PAL protein by the current method was up to 1.1 mg/g total seed protein. Conclusion/Significance This study successfully demonstrated the purification of an example recombinant protein from rice seeds by the ELP-intein system. The whole purification procedure can be easily scaled up for industrial production, providing the first evidence on applying the ELP-intein coupling system to achieve cost-effective purification of recombinant proteins expressed in plant bioreactors and its possible application in industry."
https://openalex.org/W2168965903,"Background In Norway, women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) are followed up after six months in order to decide whether they should undergo further follow-up or be referred back to the screening interval of three years. A high specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of the triage test is important to avoid unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Materials and Methods At the University Hospital of North Norway, repeat cytology and the HPV mRNA test PreTect HPV-Proofer, detecting E6/E7 mRNA from HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33 and 45, are used in triage of women with ASC-US and LSIL. In this study, women with LSIL cytology in the period 2005–2008 were included (n = 522). Two triage methods were evaluated in two separate groups: repeat cytology only (n = 225) and HPV mRNA testing in addition to repeat cytology (n = 297). Histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) was used as the study endpoint. Results Of 522 women with LSIL, 207 had biopsies and 125 of them had CIN2+. The sensitivity and specificity of repeat cytology (ASC-US or worse) were 85.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 72.1, 92.2) and 54.4 % (95% CI: 46.9, 61.9), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the HPV mRNA test were 94.2% (95% CI: 88.7, 99.7) and 86.0% (95% CI: 81.5, 90.5), respectively. The PPV of repeat cytology was 38.4% (95% CI: 29.9, 46.9) compared to 67.0% (95% CI: 57.7, 76.4) of the HPV mRNA test. Conclusion HPV mRNA testing was more sensitive and specific than repeat cytology in triage of women with LSIL cytology. In addition, the HPV mRNA test showed higher PPV. These data indicate that the HPV mRNA test is a better triage test for women with LSIL than repeat cytology."
https://openalex.org/W2049364674,"Fish populations vary geographically in demography and life history due to environmental and ecological processes and in response to exploitation. However, population dynamic models and stock assessments, used to manage fisheries, rarely explicitly incorporate spatial variation to inform management decisions. Here, we describe extensive geographic variation in several demographic and life history characteristics (e.g., size structure, growth, survivorship, maturation, and sex change) of California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher), a temperate rocky reef fish targeted by recreational and commercial fisheries. Fish were sampled from nine locations throughout southern California in 2007-2008. We developed a dynamic size and age-structured model, parameterized separately for each location, to assess the potential cost or benefit in terms of fisheries yield and conservation objectives of changing minimum size limits and/or fishing mortality rates (compared to the status quo). Results indicate that managing populations individually, with location-specific regulations, could increase yield by over 26% while maintaining conservative levels of spawning biomass. While this local management approach would be challenging to implement in practice, we found statistically similar increases in yield could be achieved by dividing southern California into two separate management regions, reflecting geographic similarities in demography. To maximize yield, size limits should be increased by 90 mm in the northern region and held at current levels in the south. We also found that managing the fishery as one single stock (the status quo), but with a size limit 50 mm greater than the current regulations, could increase overall fishery yield by 15%. Increases in size limits are predicted to enhance fishery yield and may also have important ecological consequences for the predatory role of sheephead in kelp forests. This framework for incorporating demographic variation into fisheries models can be exported generally to other species and may aid in identifying the appropriate spatial scales for fisheries management."
https://openalex.org/W2033745161,"Feeding activities of animals, including insects, are influenced by various signals from the external environment, internal energy status, and physiological conditions. Full understanding of how such signals are integrated to regulate feeding activities has, however, been hampered by a lack of knowledge about the genes involved. Here, we identified an anorexic Drosophila melanogaster mutant (GS1189) in which the expression of a newly identified gene, Anorexia (Anox), is mutated. In Drosophila larvae, Anox encodes an acyl-CoA binding protein with an ankyrin repeat domain that is expressed in the cephalic chemosensory organs and various neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Loss of its expression or disturbance of neural transmission in Anox-expressing cells decreased feeding activity. Conversely, overexpression of Anox in the CNS increased food intake. We further found that Anox regulates expression of the insulin receptor gene (dInR); overexpression and knockdown of Anox in the CNS, respectively, elevated and repressed dInR expression, which altered larval feeding activity in parallel with Anox expression levels. Anox mutant adults also showed significant repression of sugar-induced nerve responses and feeding potencies. Although Anox expression levels did not depend on the fasting and feeding states cycle, stressors such as high temperature and desiccation significantly repressed its expression levels. These results strongly suggest that Anox is essential for gustatory sensation and food intake of Drosophila through regulation of the insulin signaling activity that is directly regulated by internal nutrition status. Therefore, the mutant strain lacking Anox expression cannot enhance feeding potencies even under starvation.

Therefore, the mutant strain lacking Anox expression cannot enhance feeding potencies even under starvation. Feeding is one of the most important activities of animals, and it affects almost all aspects of animal growth and reproduction. It is therefore essential for all animals to assess their nutrient requirements and the nutrient supply offered by the environment. The sense of taste enables an animal to sample its environment and identify nutrient-rich foods. Using such external sensory inputs, the central nervous system (CNS) integrates an animal's feeding behavior depending on the availability and quality of nutrients. In this context, a primary goal of studying feeding activities of animals is to understand how information from sensory organs about foods is encoded by the nervous system (1Schwartz M.W. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Seeley R.J. Baskin D.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar). Significant breakthroughs in our understanding of gustatory perception in animals have come from identification of the genes encoding the taste receptors in mammals (2Hoon M.A. Adler E. Lindemeier J.

In Drosophila melanogaster, various tastants appear to be detected primarily by a family of 68 gustatory receptors (6Robertson H.M. Warr C.G. Carlson J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14537-14542Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 7Clyne P.J. Warr C.G. Carlson J.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1830-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 8Scott K.

Amrein H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 822-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although these gustatory receptors have almost no sequence similarity to the mammalian taste receptors (T1R and T2R), receptor proteins of both animals belong to the seven-transmembrane family of G-protein-coupled receptors. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that most animals perceive tastes similarly and simply through interactions between tastant ligands and receptor proteins (10Amrein H. Thorne N. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R673-R684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because the integration of external and internal signals into feeding behaviors is highly complex compared with the process of sensing tastes, the number of genes contributing to this process is possibly much higher than those contributing to the tasting process. Identifying these genes is essential to understand the neural circuit that controls each process of taste-mediated feeding behavior. Drosophila provides a genetically accessible system to dissect the molecular mechanisms that coordinate feeding behavior through sensory signals. To identify genes that mediate the feeding behavior of Drosophila larvae, we previously took a genetic approach by conducting a loss-of-function modifier screen using Gene Search (GS) 2The abbreviations used are: GSGene SearchRRMRNA recognition motifTOterminal organDOdorsal organVOventral organHSDHonestly significant differenceTNTtetanus toxin. strains, in which a single GS vector (P{GS}) is inserted into the genome (11Toba G. Ohsako T. Miyata N. Ohtsuka T. Seong K.H. Aigaki T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 725-737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that inserting the P{GS} into CG33071 of GS1189 strain larva produced an abnormal feeding preference when larvae are allowed to choose between two tastants, such as corn- and soybean-based foods, and they did not show a decided food preference, as control larvae do (12Ryuda M.

Sci. 2008; 25: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Several behavioral assays revealed that the mutant larvae lack the ability to evaluate the quality of foods due to defects in their chemosensory system. Although the mechanism by which CG33071 contributes to maintaining a normal chemosensory function has not yet been revealed, this work indicated that certain uncharacterized genes regulate or influence the feeding potencies of Drosophila larvae. The results also implied the validity of the Drosophila GS lines for studying the molecular mechanism of feeding responses in this animal. Gene Search RNA recognition motif terminal organ dorsal organ ventral organ Honestly significant difference tetanus toxin. In the present study, we focused on the feeding potencies of Drosophila larvae to identify genes that contribute to the integration of external and internal signals into feeding behaviors. To identify mutant Drosophila larvae with feeding activities significantly different from those of control larvae such as y w and wild-type larvae, we screened the GS strains and found that the same GS strain, GS1189, which lacked a significant taste preference, exhibited a significant decreased feeding potency. Therefore, we focused on this strain to investigate the molecular mechanisms that cause the down-regulation of feeding in this strain. Anatomical analysis using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter showed the specific expression of CG33071 in the cephalic chemosensory organs and various neurons in the CNS, including the subesophageal ganglion and antennal lobe region, that have been reported to contribute to the detection of chemosensory information and integration of these gustatory signals. A further finding that CG33071 regulates expression of the insulin-like receptor gene (dInR) indicates the possibility that CG33071 expression in the cephalic sensory organs and CNS contributes essentially to gustatory sensation and mediates the feeding activity of Drosophila through regulation of the insulin-signaling activity. Based on these results, we propose that CG33071 be henceforth referred to as Anorexia (Anox). Drosophila stocks were reared on standard cornmeal-glucose-yeast medium at 23 °C (12Ryuda M. Tsuzuki S.

We first screened 480 GS strain larvae to identify strains whose appetite was significantly different from those of the control (y w, Canton-S (CS), and Oregon-R (OR)) types. Two strains (GS51 and GS1189) showed decreased feeding activities, whereas two other strains (GS1008 and GS1203) showed increased feeding responses compared with the control larvae (y w, CS, and OR) (Fig. 1A). Of these four mutants, the greatest difference in feeding activities between control and mutant larvae was observed in GS1189, which was previously identified by a two-way choice assay as a strain with an altered food preference during the larval stage (12Ryuda M. Tsuzuki S. Tanimura T. Tojo S. Hayakawa Y. J. Insect Physiol. 2008; 54: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We therefore focused on this anorexic strain to precisely analyze the functional role of the target gene into which P{GS} was inserted, as well as the phenotypes of this mutant. Detailed analysis of growth rates of GS1189 larvae showed a significant reduction in weight gain and consequent delay of larval growth. An ∼70% decrease in weight gain of the mutant larvae by the 5th day of the last instar caused a 2- to 3-day delay in pupation on average (Fig. 1B). This growth retardation was not due to a physical defect in mouth-hook contractions: as shown in Fig. 1C, the mouth-hook contraction rates of the control and GS1189 larvae were no different when they were put into water, but the contraction rates of the mutant larvae were significantly lower than those of the controls when they were put into agar containing yeast or standard diet components, indicating the possibility that GS1189 larvae possess a defect in the ability to sense tastants. The GS element P{GS} insertion site in GS1189 was found in the ORF of CG33071 when we first checked the Flybase database in 2007; therefore, we named this gene Anorexia (Anox) based on the phenotype of GS1189 larvae. The current annotation in Flybase describes Anox as a putative dicistronic gene containing a 5′ ORF encoding an RNA recognition motif (RRM) (CG33714) and a 3′ ORF encoding an acyl-CoA binding protein with an ankyrin repeat domain (ACBP-ANK) (CG33713) (Fig. 2A). To test for the transcription of these genes in the CNSs of Drosophila y w and GS1189 larvae, we performed Northern blotting and detected the transcript in y w but not in GS1189 larvae (Fig. 2B). We next examined the protein expression in the larval CNS using antibodies for both proteins (supplemental Fig. S1). Immunoblotting showed a clear band cross-reacted with anti-ACBP-ANK protein IgG but did not show the positive band cross-reacted with anti-RRM protein antibody (Fig. 2C), indicating that at least the ACBP-ANK protein expressed in normal fly larvae could act as an Anox gene product. However, although we did not detect the RRM protein band, we could not rule out the possibility that the expression level was too low to detect it in the larval CNS. The 588-bp 5′ flanking region of Anox (putative promoter region) drives GFP reporter expression of Drosophila larva mainly in the external mouth region in addition to the CNS of Drosophila larva (Fig. 3, A and B). Strong expression in the CNS was observed mainly in the brain and the subesophageal, thoracic, and abdominal ganglia (Fig. 3, C and E). The dorsal view showed expression in the neurosecretory cells in the pars intercerebralis region of the protocerebrum that is close to the cells reported to express insulin-like peptide genes 1, 2, 3, and 5 (dip 1–3 and 5) (23Cao C. Brown M.R. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 304: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Ikeya T. Galic M. Belawat P. Nairz K. Hafen E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1293-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D). The ventral view showed GFP expression in cell clusters of the antennal lobe and subesophageal ganglion (Fig. 3F). The cells that expressed GFP in the thoracic abdominal ganglions were slightly more abundant in the ventral region than in the dorsal region (Fig. 3, C and E). The GFP signal was also observed in external and internal gustatory organs. Several sensory neurons close to the terminal organ (TO) and dorsal organ (DO) showed strong expression, but no positive neuron was observed beside the ventral organ (VO) (Fig. 3, G and H). Dorsal and ventral views of the pharynx region displayed clear signals in the dorsal pharyngeal sense organ (DPS) and ventral pharyngeal sense organ (VPS), respectively (Fig. 3, I–L). In adults, the GFP signal was also clearly observed in external sensory organs such as the sensilla of the labella, maxillary palpi, and tarsi (supplemental Fig. S2). To reveal effects of Anox on the regulation of feeding potencies, we examined whether physiological and environmental conditions alter CNS Anox expression levels in Drosophila. Although no hunger-driven increase in Anox expression was observed, heat or desiccation stress conditions significantly repressed its expression in the CNS of test larvae (Fig. 4, A and B). The stress-induced repression of the CNS Anox expression was also observed in the adults. These results indicated that a constant level of Anox expression is required irrespective of nutritional states in normal physiological conditions, although we could not exclude the possibility that the hunger-driven increase in Anox expression occurred in too small a subset of cells and neurons to be detected by our present analyses. To evaluate the effects of Anox expression on feeding potencies of larvae, Anox expression was either up-regulated by expressing a functional Anox cDNA (UAS-Anox) or down-regulated by expressing Anox dsRNA (UAS-dsAnox) under the direction of an Anox promoter (Anox-Gal4) (supplemental Fig. S3), and the feeding activities of resulting transgenic larvae were assayed. Overexpression of Anox enhanced feeding activities relative to controls, whereas its down-regulation significantly repressed the activities (Fig. 5A). The repressed feeding activities of Anox-knockdown larvae were not elevated even by starvation (Fig. 5B). To gain further information on the function of Anox-expressing neurons, we then blocked synaptic transmission in these neurons by expressing UAS-TNT under the direction of Anox-Gal4. The feeding activities of these larvae were significantly restricted by the neurotoxin TNT (Fig. 5C), whereas the feeding potentials of control larvae that expressed weaker TNT (TNTE) or imperfect TNT (IMP TNT) were not altered. These data thus indicate that Anox contributes to the regulation of feeding activities of Drosophila. We previously carried out a large-scale oligonucleotide-DNA microarray screening to reveal the genetic mechanism underlying the change of feeding behaviors of GS1189 larvae (13Ryuda M. Shimada K. Koyanagi R. Azumi K. Tanimura T. Hayakawa Y. Zool. Sci. 2008; 25: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Although we identified several interesting genes whose expression levels were significantly different between y w and GS1189 larvae, the experimental information was not sufficient to explain the mechanism. To further characterize the components of an Anox signaling pathway, we here performed differential display RT-PCR on total RNAs prepared from y w and GS1189 strain larval CNS using 60 different primer sets (Annealing Control Primer 1–60, Seegene, Inc.). Of these, one primer (Annealing Control Primer 12) revealed a significant reduction in transcription of one DNA band encoding the Drosophila insulin receptor gene (dInR) in the CNS of GS1189 larvae compared with that in the control. To confirm this finding, we performed quantitative RT-PCR to estimate expression levels of dInR together with insulin-like peptide genes in the control (y w) and GS1189 larval CNS (Fig. 6A). The results showed that expression of most dilps as well as dInR was reduced, further, of all dilp expression levels, the difference in dilp3 expression between y w and GS1189 larvae was the biggest. Further, we confirmed that the repressed dInR transcription levels in GS1189 larvae were not altered by changes in physiological conditions, fed or starved (supplemental Fig. S4). To assess whether neural dInR expression is regulated by Anox, dInR expression levels were analyzed in larval CNS whose transcription levels of Anox were genetically up- or down-regulated. The results demonstrated that dInR expression was positively regulated by Anox: dInR expression in larvae was elevated by Anox up-regulation, whereas it was clearly reduced by Anox down-regulation (Fig. 6B). We then investigated the effects of neural dInR down-regulation on feeding activities of larvae whose dInR expression was repressed broadly or specifically in Anox neurons (supplemental Fig. S5). Both types of dInR knockdowns had significantly decreased feeding activities relative to control larvae (Fig. 6C). These results together with the clear repression of dInR expression in larvae with down-regulated Anox expression indicate that the decrease in feeding activities of GS1189 larvae was at least partly due to the repression of dInR expression in the CNS. To analyze the mechanism of repression of dInR expression in GS1189, we focused on Akt activity, which negatively regulates dInR expression through phosphorylation of the transcription factor dFOXO for dInR: phosphorylated dFOXO cannot enter the nucleus to promote dInR expression (25Jünger M.A. Rintelen F. Stocker H. Wasserman J.D. Vegh M. Radimerski T. Greenberg M.E. Hafen E. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Puig O. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2435-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Interestingly, active (phosphorylated) Akt levels in GS1189 were constantly maintained above a certain level irrespective of larval physiologies, fed or starved, although active Akt was detected only very low level in starved control GS1189rev larvae (Fig. 6D). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the dInR expression level was kept constantly low irrespective of the physiological conditions in GS1189. The effects of Anox mutation on adult feeding activity and life span were investigated. Capillary feeder assays showed that Anox-deficient (GS1189), Anox RNAi, and InR RNAi adults had remarkably reduced feeding responses relative to control adults (Fig. 7A). As observed in Drosophila transgenic larvae (Anox-Gal4;UAS-TNT), the adult feeding responses were also significantly restricted by the neurotoxin TNT. In contrast, overexpression of Anox significantly enhanced feeding activities relative to controls. Further, to address whether the electrophysiological response to sugars was defective in GS1189 flies, we recorded tastant-induced action potentials in taste sensilla of GS1189 adults. In control CS flies, sugar-induced action potentials were detected in the labellum gustatory sensilla using glucose and sucrose at concentrations from 10 to 1000 mm, whereas they were significantly decreased in GS1189 flies (Fig. 7B). These results together with the observation that GS1189rev flies had recovered the nerve responses to sugar reception (supplemental Fig. S6) indicate that Anox is needed for normal sugar perception. Measurement of longevities of control and mutant flies showed that the average life span was significantly shortened in GS1189 relative to control flies; in particular, earlier mortality was more obvious in males than in females (supplemental Fig. S7). The reduction in the longevity may be explained by a shortage of nutrition due to the marked drop in adult feeding activity. This study demonstrated that GS1189 mutant larvae that lacked normal Anox expression had suppressed appetites in which dInR expression levels were significantly down-regulated. This finding is consistent with our general knowledge that insulin signaling is rapidly modulated in response to changes in nutrition in animals, including Drosophila (26Puig O. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2435-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27Buch S. Melcher C. Bauer M. Katzenberger J. Pankratz M.J. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The fact that the feeding activities of GS1189 larvae continuously remained very low suggested that regulation of feeding potencies by insulin signaling was somehow disordered in the mutant animals. This speculation was at least partially confirmed by the result that dInR expression levels were consistently down-regulated irrespective of nutrient availability. Despite the transcriptional down-regulation of dilps as well as dInR in GS1189 larvae, insulin signaling was continuously activated at a low level via the continuously but only partially activated Akt (Fig. 6D). It is also worth emphasizing that the bodies of full-grown GS1189 larvae reached almost the same size as those of controls when the feeding period was extended; therefore, the adults appeared to be normal size. GS1189 adults nevertheless exhibited greatly diminished feeding activities and shortened life span compared with control flies (Fig. 7A and supplemental Fig. S4). We interpreted these phenotypes of GS1189 in light of the disordered regulation of insulin signaling as follows. In normal animals, inactivation of insulin signaling due to limited nutrition elevates feeding activity, and this allows the animal to achieve a satiated condition, which reactivates insulin signaling; thus, as long as insulin signaling works normally, feeding activity of Drosophila is maintained at a certain level. Further, it is well known that longevity is extended if dietary restriction is applied to adult Drosophila (28Novick P. Ferro S. Schekman R. Cell. 1981; 25: 461-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). However, GS1189 adults with the decreased appetite die younger than normal flies because their feeding activities are continuously too low to ingest enough nutrition to survive as long as or longer than normal flies. This may be mainly due to a defect of the insulin signaling system (transcriptional control of dInR and dips) that regulates the feeding activity in response to the internal nutritional status. Decreases in the life span due to a deficit in nutrition have been reported in several animals, including Drosophila (29Luquet S. Perez F.A. Hnasko T.S. Palmiter R.D. Science. 2005; 310: 683-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 30Partridge L. Piper M.D. Mair W. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 938-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Anox, which encodes acyl-CoA binding protein with a short ankyrin repeat domain, is mainly expressed in the CNS and cephalic chemosensory organs where the integration of gustatory signals as well as the detection of chemosensory cues proceeds (8Scott K. Brady Jr., R. Cravchik A. Morozov P. Rzhetsky A. Zuker C. Axel R. Cell. 2001; 104: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 10Amrein H. Thorne N. Curr.

Cell. 2004; 117: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Because changes in dInR expression parallel changes in Anox expression in the CNS, we concluded that the neural dInR expression is regulated by the upstream regulatory gene Anox in the CNS. This conclusion was partially confirmed by the observation that dInR RNAi in Anox-expressing cells reproduced the phenotype of GS1189 or Anox RNAi larvae, i.e. decreased feeding activities and consequent retardation of larval growth. Although we do not have enough data to explain in detail the role of the Anox product in regulating dInR expression at present, there is some evidence to predict its possible role as follows. 1) The result that dInR expression continuously remains very low in GS1189 larvae and adults irrespective of their nutritional status suggests that the Anox product is essential to its transcriptional elevation under the control of dFOXO, a transcription factor for dInR. 2) The result that neural Anox expression in control y w larvae and adults is continuous irrespective of the nutritional status indicates that nutrition-dependent periodic changes in dInR expression are not regulated by Anox expression levels but mainly by Akt-dFOXO. 3) The above results, together with the observation that dInR expression levels are greatly diminished in GS1189 and Anox RNAi larvae, enable us to speculate that Akt-dFOXO-dependent regulation of dInR expression occurs only in the presence of the Anox product; therefore, the Anox product contributes to establishment of the basal condition essential in regulating dInR expression through the Akt-dFOXO system depending on the nutritional conditions. Anox encodes acyl-CoA binding protein with an ankyrin repeat domain. The Drosophila genome has a total of nine genes encoding putative acyl-CoA binding proteins: Diazepam-binding inhibitor (CG8627), CG8498, CG8814, CG8629, CG15829, CG5804, Anox (CG33713), CG14232, and CG8628. Expression of the first seven genes was observed in the CNS of y w larvae. Of these seven expressed genes, only Anox contains an ankyrin repeat domain. Ankyrin repeats are 33 amino acids long and involved in protein-protein interactions (32Mosavi L.K. Minor Jr., D.L. Peng Z.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16029-16034Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Indeed, yeast two-hybrid screening using certain proteins with ankyrin repeats as bait has discovered several target proteins with an affinity for the ankyrin repeat domain (33Zhang A. Yeung P.L. Li C.W. Tsai S.C. Dinh G.K. Wu X. Li H. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33799-33805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Based on these molecular characteristics, it is generally thought that many proteins with ankyrin repeats may play roles in integrating signals from multiple protein-protein interactions. Various kinds of ankyrin repeat-containing proteins have been identified as nuclear receptor cofactors that interact with nuclear receptors to enhance or suppress transcription of target genes (34Mikhailov A.T. Torrado M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2008; 52: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These reports enabled us to speculate that the Anox product may facilitate initiation of dInR transcription through interaction with dFOXO. However, it is also possible that the acyl-CoA binding protein portion encoded by Anox contributes to the regulation of dInR expression and feeding activity via its effect on lipid metabolism. This possibility does not contradict the fact that prior microarray screening identified two triacylglycerol lipase genes whose expression levels were significantly higher in y w larvae than in GS1189 larvae under starvation (13Ryuda M. Shimada K. Koyanagi R. Azumi K. Tanimura T. Hayakawa Y. Zool. Sci. 2008; 25: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Further, this possibility is partially supported by the fact that the Zellveger syndrome mouse, which lacks normal expression of acyl-CoA binding protein, shows a phenotype similar to the GS1189 fly: the Zellveger syndrome mouse fails to feed normally, which leads to an early death, usually in the first year of life (35Breitling R. BMC Pediatrics. 2004; 4: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).

Cys-loop receptors comprise pentameric assemblies of similar or dissimilar subunits arranged symmetrically around a central ion-conducting pore. Individual subunits comprise a large ligand-binding domain (LBD) and a transmembrane domain (TMD), the latter consisting of a bundle of four α-helices. The LBD consists of a 10-strand β-sandwich made of an inner β-sheet with six strands and an outer β-sheet with four strands (2Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding site is situated at the interface of adjacent subunits and is formed by loops A–C from one subunit and loops D-F from the neighboring subunit (2Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Agonists binding to these sites induce local conformational changes that are propagated to the distant activation gate formed by the second transmembrane (M2) pore-lining domains. Recent structural and functional studies have generated an abundance of information about the molecular rearrangements mediating channel opening (3Yakel J.L. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Miller P.S. Smart T.G. Trends Pharmacol.

Ligand-gated channels also display a phenomenon termed desensitization, which is the progressive fading of the ionic flux in the prolonged presence of agonist. The rates of onset and recovery from desensitization are important parameters governing the size and decay rate of synaptic currents (8Giniatullin R. Nistri A. Yakel J.L. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 371-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 9Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 96-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). As one example of the pathological importance of this mechanism, human hereditary mutations that change the rates of onset and recovery from desensitization in GABAA receptors and nAChRs have been shown to be associated with different forms of epilepsy (10Bowser D.N. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Cromer B.A. Parker M.W. Wallace R.H. Harkin L.A. Mulley J.C. Marini C. Berkovic S.F. Williams D.A. Jones M.V. Petrou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Despite the physiological and pathological importance of desensitization in Cys-loop receptors, little is known about the conformational changes that mediate this process. According to allosteric receptor theory, ligands stabilize the states for which they display the highest affinity (12Edelstein S.J. Schaad O. Henry E. Bertrand D. Changeux J.P. Biol. Cybern. 1996; 75: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, receptor activation occurs because agonists exhibit a higher affinity for the activated (open) than for the resting (closed) state. Similarly, desensitization occurs because agonists exhibit a higher affinity for the desensitized state than for the activated (open) state. If desensitization alters ligand affinity, then this process must involve a change in structure at the binding site. In addition, desensitization also involves a conformational change that closes the channel. Indeed, the structural basis of this closing mechanism has been elucidated in members of the structurally distinct ionotropic glutamate receptor family (13Sobolevsky A.I. Rosconi M.P. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 462: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 14Armstrong N. Jasti J. Beich-Frandsen M. Gouaux E.

Although the M2 domains of the nAChR are known to adopt a different closed state structure in the desensitized state relative to the resting closed state (17Wilson G. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the fact that mutant receptors exhibit altered desensitization rates “does not necessarily prove that the mutated sites are structural motifs responsible for this process” (8Giniatullin R. Nistri A. Yakel J.L. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 371-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although Bouzat et al. (21Bouzat C. Bartos M. Corradi J. Sine S.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7808-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) employed a chimeric approach to delimit the LDB-TMD interfacial region as a major determinant of Cys-loop receptor desensitization, a more direct method is required to determine whether desensitization-specific conformational changes do indeed occur in this or any other region of the LBD. In the present study we employed voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF) in an attempt to systematically map LBD conformational changes that move with a similar time course to the desensitization rate as an initial step toward developing a structural model for this mechanism. VCF correlates ion flux rates with conformational changes occurring in real-time in receptor domains of interest (27Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y.

It takes advantage of the fact that changes in the quantum efficiency of certain fluorophores occur in response to changes in their immediate chemical microenvironment. Homomeric α1 GlyRs are a useful model system to study this mechanism for two reasons. First, wild type (WT) α1 GlyRs desensitize slowly (29Breitinger H.G. Lanig H. Vohwinkel C. Grewer C.

Pierce K.D. Handford C.A. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Second, we have previously identified numerous residues throughout the LBD, first transmembrane (M1) domain, and external M2-M3 domains of α1 GlyRs that each respond with a robust glycine-induced fluorescence change (ΔF) after labeling with environmentally sensitive fluorophores (32Pless S.A.

Here we sought to compare time-dependent fluorescent changes from labels attached to 14 LBD and TMD sites in the absence of fast desensitization with those observed at the same labeled sites after an intracellular mutation had been introduced to dramatically enhance the desensitization rate. This enabled us to distinguish those conformational changes that remain unchanged throughout the period of ligand binding from those that tracked the desensitization rate. Although we found no evidence for conformational changes associated with desensitization at any of the labeled sites near the glycine-binding site, we did identify desensitization-specific conformational changes in loop 2 and the pre-M1 domain, which are both structural components of the LBD-TMD interface. Sulforhodamine methanethiosulfonate (MTS-R) and 2-((5(6)-tetramethylrhodamine) carboxylamino)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTS-TAMRA) were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, Canada). Alexa Fluor 546 C5 maleimide (AF546) and tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide were purchased from Invitrogen. MTS-R, MTS-TAMRA, and tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at −20 °C. AF546 was dissolved directly into ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES) on the day of the experiment and stored on ice for up to 6 h. Glycine stocks were dissolved in ND96 and stored at −20 °C. The rat α1 GlyR subunit cDNA was subcloned into the pGEMHE expression vector. The WT and all mutant constructs incorporated the C41A mutation to eliminate the sole uncross-linked extracellular cysteine. QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to generate all cysteine mutants used in this study. The successful incorporation of the mutations was confirmed by the automated sequencing of the entire coding sequence. Capped mRNA for oocyte injection was generated using mMessage mMachine (Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocytes from Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express) were prepared as described previously (32Pless S.A. Dibas M.I. Lester H.A. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36057-36067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and injected with 10 ng of mRNA. The oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C for 3–7 days in a solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 0.6 mm theophylline, 2.5 mm pyruvic acid, 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Cambrex Corp., East Rutherford, NJ), pH 7.4. On the day of recording, oocytes were transferred into ND96 containing 10–20 μm concentrations of fluorophore. Typical labeling times were 30 s for MTS-R and MTS-TAMRA (on ice), 30 min for tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide (on ice), or 45 min for AF546 (at room temperature). Oocytes were then washed thoroughly and stored in ND96 on ice for up to 6 h before recording. All fluorophores employed here respond with an increase in quantum efficiency as the hydrophobicity of their environment is increased (27Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Pless S.A. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15847-15856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Each cysteine mutant was incubated with all four fluorophores in turn, and generally the one yielding the largest glycine-induced ΔF was analyzed. As unmutated GlyRs never exhibited a ΔF or a change in electrophysiological properties after fluorophore incubation, we rule the possibility of labels binding nonspecifically to receptors. The experimental set up comprised an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a high-Q tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate filter set (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT), a LUCPlanFLN 40×/NA0.6 objective (Olympus), and a PhotoMax 200 photodiode (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) with a 12 V/100 watt halogen lamp (Olympus) as light source. The recording chamber was similar to those described previously (35Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 36Dahan D.S. Dibas M.I.

Cells were voltage-clamped at −40 mV, and currents were recorded with an OC-725C oocyte amplifier (Warner, Hamden, CT). Current and fluorescence traces were acquired at 200 Hz via a Digidata 1322A interface using pClamp 9.2 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Fluorescence signals were digitally filtered at 1–2 Hz with an eight-pole Bessel filter for analysis and display. Half-maximal concentrations (EC50) and Hill coefficient (nH) values for ligand-induced activation of current and fluorescence were obtained using the Hill equation fitted with a non-linear least squares algorithm (SigmaPlot 9.0, Systat Software, Point Richmond, CA). All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three or more independent experiments. Unless otherwise indicated, statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test, with p < 0.05 representing significance. WT α1 GlyR currents exhibit a low rate of desensitization with a ΔI time constant (τΔI) that typically exceeds 25 s (29Breitinger H.G. Lanig H. Vohwinkel C. Grewer C. Breitinger U. Clark T. Becker C.M. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1339-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the A248L mutation in the intracellular M1-M2 loop increases τΔI to around 1 s (29Breitinger H.G. Lanig H. Vohwinkel C. Grewer C. Breitinger U. Clark T. Becker C.M. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1339-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have previously identified a range of cysteine-substituted residues in the LBD and pre-M1 domains of α1 GlyRs that, when tagged with an environmentally sensitive fluorophore, elicit robust glycine-induced ΔF responses (32Pless S.A.

Chem. 2009; 284: 27370-27376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we sought to compare the time course of the ΔI and ΔF responses of each of these cysteine-substituted receptors with and without the desensitization-enhancing A248L mutation. We reasoned that fluorescence signals that increase or decrease in magnitude with a ΔF time constant (τΔF) comparable with τΔI are likely to be reporting a conformational change associated with desensitization. Alternately, those ΔF signals that remain constant during desensitization are more likely to be reporting a conformational change associated with agonist-binding or receptor activation. Mean glycine EC50, nH, and ΔImax values for the A248L mutant GlyR are summarized in Table 1. We found the glycine EC50 value was increased by around an order of magnitude relative to the WT value. We also found the ΔImax decayed rapidly and almost completely, with a τΔI of 1.53 ± 0.13 s (n = 4).TABLE 1Summary of results for glycine-activated current and fluorescence

https://openalex.org/W1999651272,"AKAP12/Gravin (A kinase anchor protein 12) is one of the A-kinase scaffold proteins and a potential tumor suppressor gene in human primary cancers. Our recent study demonstrated the highly recurrent loss of AKAP12 in colorectal cancer and AKAP12 reexpression inhibited proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in colorectal cancer cells, implicating AKAP12 in colorectal cancer pathogenesis.To evaluate the effect of this gene on the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer, we examined the impact of overexpressing AKAP12 in the AKAP12-negative human colorectal cancer cell line LoVo, the single clone (LoVo-AKAP12) compared to mock-transfected cells (LoVo-CON).pCMV6-AKAP12-mediated AKAP12 re-expression induced apoptosis (3% to 12.7%, p<0.01), migration (89.6±7.5 cells to 31.0±4.1 cells, p<0.01) and invasion (82.7±5.2 cells to 24.7±3.3 cells, p<0.01) of LoVo cells in vitro compared to control cells. Nude mice injected with LoVo-AKAP12 cells had both significantly reduced tumor volume (p<0.01) and increased apoptosis compared to mice given AKAP12-CON. The quantitative human-specific Alu PCR analysis showed overexpression of AKAP12 suppressed the number of intravasated cells in vivo (p<0.01).These results demonstrate that AKAP12 may play an important role in tumor growth suppression and the survival of human colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2005299390,"The first metallocarboxypeptidase (CP) was identified in pancreatic extracts more than 80 years ago and named carboxypeptidase A (CPA; now known as CPA1). Since that time, seven additional mammalian members of the CPA subfamily have been described, all of which are initially produced as proenzymes, are activated by endoproteases, and remove either C-terminal hydrophobic or basic amino acids from peptides. Here we describe the enzymatic and structural properties of carboxypeptidase O (CPO), a previously uncharacterized and unique member of the CPA subfamily. Whereas all other members of the CPA subfamily contain an N-terminal prodomain necessary for folding, bioinformatics and expression of both human and zebrafish CPO orthologs revealed that CPO does not require a prodomain. CPO was purified by affinity chromatography, and the purified enzyme was able to cleave proteins and synthetic peptides with greatest activity toward acidic C-terminal amino acids unlike other CPA-like enzymes. CPO displayed a neutral pH optimum and was inhibited by common metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitors as well as citrate. CPO was modified by attachment of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor to the C terminus of the protein. Immunocytochemistry of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing CPO showed localization to vesicular membranes in subconfluent cells and to the plasma membrane in differentiated cells. CPO is highly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells in both zebrafish and human. These results suggest that CPO cleaves acidic amino acids from dietary proteins and peptides, thus complementing the actions of well known digestive carboxypeptidases CPA and CPB."

https://openalex.org/W2008039943,"In the present study, we have electrophysiologically characterized native nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in human chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland as well as their contribution to the exocytotic process. α-Conotoxin AuIB blocked by 14 ± 1% the acetylcholine (ACh)-induced nicotinic current. α-Conotoxin MII (α-Ctx MII) exhibited an almost full blockade of the nicotinic current at nanomolar concentrations (IC50=21.6 nM). The α6∗-preferring α-Ctx MII mutant analogs, α-Ctx MII[H9A,L15A] and α-Ctx MII[S4A,E11A,L15A], blocked nAChR currents with an IC50 of 217.8 and 33 nM, respectively. These data reveal that nAChRs in these cells include the α6∗ subtype. The washout of the blockade exerted by α-conotoxin BuIA (α-Ctx BuIA; 1 μM) on ACh-evoked currents was slight and slow, arguing in favor of the presence of a β4 subunit in the nAChR composition.

Whereas complex formation of these adaptors with individual motifs has been studied in great detail, little is known about the binding mode of domains arranged in tandem repeats and long proline-rich sequences including multiple motifs. Here we studied the interaction of the two adjacent WW domains of spliceosomal protein FBP21 with several ligands of different lengths and composition to elucidate the hallmarks of multivalent binding for this class of recognition domains. First, we show that many of the proteins that define the cellular proteome interacting with FBP21-WW1-WW2 contain multiple proline-rich motifs. Among these is the newly identified binding partner SF3B4. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis reveals the tandem-WW domains of FBP21 to interact with splicing factor 3B4 (SF3B4) in nuclear speckles where splicing takes place. Isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR shows that the tandem arrangement of WW domains and the multivalency of the proline-rich ligands both contribute to affinity enhancement. However, ligand exchange remains fast compared with the NMR time scale. Surprisingly, a N-terminal spin label attached to a bivalent ligand induces NMR line broadening of signals corresponding to both WW domains of the FBP21-WW1-WW2 protein. This suggests that distinct orientations of the ligand contribute to a delocalized and semispecific binding mode that should facilitate search processes within the spliceosome.

https://openalex.org/W2012422247,"The xanthine permease XanQ of Escherichia coli is used as a study prototype for function-structure analysis of the ubiquitous nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT/NCS2) family. Our previous mutagenesis study of polar residues of XanQ has shown that Asn-93 at the middle of putative TM3 is a determinant of substrate affinity and specificity. To study the role of TM3 in detail we employed Cys-scanning mutagenesis. Using a functional mutant devoid of Cys residues (C-less), each amino acid residue in sequence 79-107 (YGIVGSGLLSIQSVNFSFVTVMIALGSSM) including TM3 (underlined) and flanking sequences was replaced individually with Cys. Of 29 single-Cys mutants, 20 accumulate xanthine to 40-110% of the steady state observed with C-less, six (S88C, F94C, A102C, G104C, S106C) accumulate to low levels (10-30%) and three (G83C, G85C, N93C) are inactive. Extensive mutagenesis reveals that Gly-83 and, to a lesser extent, Gly-85, are crucial for expression in the membrane. Replacements of Asn-93 disrupt affinity (Thr) or permit recognition of 8-methylxanthine which is not a wild-type ligand (Ala, Ser, Asp) and utilization of uric acid which is not a wild-type substrate (Ala, Ser). Replacements of Phe-94 impair affinity for 2-thio and 6-thioxanthine (Tyr) or 3-methylxanthine (Ile). Single-Cys mutants S84C, L86C, L87C, and S95C are highly sensitive to inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide. Our data reveal that key residues of TM3 cluster in two conserved sequence motifs, (83)GSGLL(87) and (93)NFS(95), and highlight the importance of Asn-93 and Phe-94 in substrate recognition and specificity; these findings are supported by structural modeling on the recently described x-ray structure of the uracil-transporting homolog UraA."

Here we show the validity of this approach by studying the predicted functional interaction between ICln and HSPC038. In C. elegans, the gene encoding for the ICln homolog (icln-1) is embedded in an operon with two other genes, Nx (the human homolog of Nx is HSPC038) and Ny. ICln is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in the regulatory volume decrease after cell swelling. Following hypotonic stress, ICln translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where it has been proposed to participate in the activation of the swelling-induced chloride current (IClswell). Here we show that the interaction between human ICln and HSPC038 plays a role in volume regulation after cell swelling and that HSPC038 acts as an escort, directing ICln to the cell membrane after cell swelling and facilitating the activation of IClswell. Assessment of the NMR structure of HSPC038 showed the presence of a zinc finger motif.

The human homolog of Nx is HSPC038, a small (molecular mass = 8498 Da), basic (pI = 10.02), hydrophilic protein whose function was unknown. We observed that as a consequence of coreconstituting Nx together with the IClnN2 splice variant in artificial lipid membranes, the current induced by IClnN2 was no longer voltage-sensitive, thereby revealing a functional interaction between the two C. elegans proteins (5Fürst J.

However, in contrast to the nematode system, the human ICln (CLNS1A, chromosome 11, position 11q13.5) and HSPC038 (chromosome 8, position 8q22.3) genes are not in close genomic proximity to each other, and no data in the literature suggested an interaction between the corresponding proteins. Nevertheless, as our data show, both human gene products establish a molecular interaction in vivo similarly to the C. elegans counterparts. These findings underscore the use of the operon structure of the nematode genome as an extremely powerful tool for the identification of partner proteins, which can be successfully translated to the human system. swelling-activated chloride current enhanced cyan fluorescent protein enhanced yellow fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein FK506-binding protein internal ribosome entry site 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid heteronuclear single quantum coherence analysis of variance FKB12/rapamycin-associated protein FKBP12/rapamycin-binding. The ORFs of full-length HSPC038 and ICln were amplified by PCR using standard protocols. The PCR products were cloned in frame into the mammalian expression vectors pECFPC1, pEYFPC1, pECFPN1, or pEYFPN1 (Clontech) to produce fusion proteins suitable for FRET experiments. For electrophysiology experiments, HSPC038 and ICln ORFs were cloned into the bicistronic mammalian expression vector pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech). Control experiments were conducted in cells transfected with the pIRES2-EGFP-EGFP vector, where an additional EGFP coding sequence was cloned into the pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) expression vector. Consequently, a single control vector contains two EGFP coding sequences (one in the multiple cloning site and one downstream of the IRES sequence). For electrophysiology experiments where HSPC038-ICln dimerization was drug-induced, the HSPC038 ORF was subcloned into the pC4-RHE vector (ARGENTTM-regulated heterodimerization kit, version 2.0; Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA; now iDimerize, Clontech). Then the HSPC038-FRB or FRB-HSPC038 coding sequences were subcloned into the pIRES2dsREDexpress vector (Clontech). The final constructs allowed for the coexpression of the dsREDexpress protein with either (i) HSPC038 with the FRB domain fused to the C terminus (HSPC038-FRB) or (ii) HSPC038 with the FRB domain fused to the N terminus (FRB-HSPC038). A similar procedure was adopted for ICln: the ICln ORF was subcloned into the pC4EN-F1 and pC4M-F2E vectors and then into pIRES2-EGFP. The final constructs allowed for the coexpression of the EGFP protein with either (i) ICln with a single FKBP domain fused to the C terminus (ICln-FKBP) or (ii) ICln with two FKBP domains fused to the C terminus and a myristoylation sequence fused to the N terminus (myr-ICln-FKBP-FKBP). The myristoylation sequence enabled the fusion protein to be targeted to the plasma membrane. The use of vectors bearing the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) allows for the simultaneous expression of two individual proteins (HSPC038 or ICln and EGFP or the dsRedExpress protein) from a single bicistronic mRNA without the production of fusion proteins (31Morgan R.A. Couture L. Elroy-Stein O. Ragheb J. Moss B. Anderson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore, because EGFP or dsRedExpress expression occurs only if preceded by HSPC038 or ICln expression, the single transfected cells can be individuated optically by detecting the fluorescent light emitted by EGFP (excitation maximum, 488 nm; emission maximum, 507 nm) or dsRedExpress (excitation maximum, 557 nm; emission maximum, 579 nm).

The resistance of the glass pipettes was 3–8 MΩ when filled with the pipette solution (125 mm CsCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 50 mm raffinose, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted with CsOH)). The hypertonic bath solution was composed of 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm mannitol, pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH). Fast exchange of the hypertonic bath solution with a hypotonic bath solution (125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) was obtained using a perfusion system with a flow rate of 5 ml/min and a bath volume of ∼300 μl. For the experiments where purified proteins were added to the pipette filling (intracellular) solution, 15 μg/ml ICln (0.57 μm), 15 μg/ml HSPC038 (1.76 μm), or equimolar amounts of ICln and HSPC038 (1.76 μm each, 46 μg/ml and 15 μg/ml, respectively; the use of equimolar amount of proteins does not imply a 1:1 stoichiometry of the putative ICln-HSPC038 complex) were used. For the control experiments, an adequate volume of the appropriate elution buffer was added to the pipette filling solution. The diffusion of substances from the pipette filling solution to the intracellular milieu was verified with 10 μg/ml fluorescent dextrans (molecular mass = 40,000 Da; Molecular Probes) after the establishment of the whole cell configuration. All of the experiments were carried out at room temperature. Additional details regarding data acquisition are given in the supplemental materials. FRET studies were performed as described earlier (15Ritter M. Ravasio A. Jakab M. Chwatal S. Fürst J. Laich A. Gschwentner M. Signorelli S. Burtscher C. Eichmüller S. Paulmichl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50163-50174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were double transfected with pECFP-mem (Clontech) and pEYFPN1-HSPC038 or pECFPN1-ICln and pEYFPN1-HSPC038. Transfected cells were perfused at room temperature with an isotonic solution containing 90 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 80 mm mannitol, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After recording the fluorescent signals under isotonic conditions, the cells were perfused with a hypotonic solution (90 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and ECFP, EYFP, and FRET images were recorded after 5, 15, and 30 min following hypotonic shock. Additional details are given in the supplemental materials. All of the proteins were overexpressed as N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli BL21 (DE3) or BL21 (DE3) pLys bacteria. Bacterial cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.8. Protein overexpression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the bacterial culture to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. Bacterial cells were harvested 4 h after induction. His6-tagged fusion proteins were purified using standard protocols described in detail in the supplemental materials. 50 μg of purified recombinant HSPC038, 50 μg of ICln, or a mixture of the two proteins were incubated in a buffer containing 25 mm K2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.2, for 2 h at 4 °C and subsequently separated on 10% native PAGE gels. Purified recombinant HSPC038 was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control beads were prepared by coupling ethanolamine instead of protein to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads. Aliquots of either HSPC038-coupled resin or control beads were then incubated with purified ICln or its mutants (final concentration, 1 mg/ml) in a buffer containing 25 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, bound ICln proteins were eluted by low pH buffer (500 mm Tris, pH 2.5), and elution fractions were neutralized by the addition of 500 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and then separated by SDS-PAGE. All of the NMR experiments were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker DRX 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance z-gradient cryoprobe. NMR data were processed and visualized using the NMRPipe software (34Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11517) Google Scholar) and ANSIG for Windows (35Helgstrand M. Kraulis P. Allard P. Härd T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Resonance assignments of HSPC038 was accomplished with three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC and 15N total total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC experiments from the Bruker program library. Partial backbone resonance assignments of ICln 1–159 were made based on published assignments (36Schedlbauer A. Kontaxis G. König M. Fürst J. Jakab M. Ritter M. Garavaglia L. Bottà G. Meyer G. Paulmichl M. Konrat R. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 27: 399-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To map the interaction interfaces upon interaction between HSPC038 and ICln 1–159, two protein samples were prepared: one with 15N labeled HSPC038 (0.8 mm) and unlabeled ICln 1–159 (0.9 mm), and the second with 15N-labeled ICln 1–159 (1 mm) and unlabeled HSPC038 (3 mm). The chemical shift perturbations following complex formation were small, and assignments of the complexes were based on the assignments of the free proteins. Perturbations in resonance frequency (Δν) resulting from complex formation was analyzed using Equation 1, Δv=(ΔvH)2+(ΔvN)2(Eq. 1) where ΔνH and ΔνN are perturbations in 1H and 15N resonance frequency, respectively. A homology model of the zinc finger motif of HSPC038 was generated with Swiss model (37Kiefer F. Arnold K. Künzli M. Bordoli L. Schwede T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D387-D392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 38Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6024) Google Scholar) using the first zinc finger motif of conformer number one in Protein Data Bank code 2GHF as the template. siRNAs for knocking down the expression of HSPC038 (core sequence: 5′-GAA ACA AGG ACA UGA CCA A-3′) were designed with the siRNA Design Tool of Microsynth CH. HEK293 Phoenix cells seeded into Ø 30-mm Petri dishes were transfected with 180 pmol of siRNAs and 12 μl of Metafectene SI (Biontex) following the manufacturer's instruction. Control cells were transfected with the following negative control siRNA (Microsynth CH): 5′-AGGUAGUGUAAUCGCCUUG-3′. Functional (patch clamp) or expression (semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR) assays were performed 48–56 h after transfection. Extraction of total RNA was performed with the All Prep DNA/RNA mini kit (Qiagen). 1 μg of total RNA was used for the reverse transcription reaction with the QuantiTect® reverse transcription kit for cDNA synthesis with integrated removal of genomic DNA contamination (Qiagen). For detecting the HSPC038 transcript, the following primers were used: forward, 5′-CGT GGA CAG CAG AAG ATT CAG-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGT GGA GCT TTA GGG TGC TTG-3′. The HSPC038 signal was normalized to the β-actin signal, detected by using the following primers: forward, 5′-GGCATGGGTCAGAAGGATTC-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGAGGCGTACAGGGATAGCAC-3′. These primers span an intron-exon boundary and would disclose an eventual contamination from genomic DNA as a band at 700 bp, which was not detected (see Fig. 8a). Densitometric analysis was done with the ImageJ 1.38x program. Standard protocols described in detail in the supplemental materials were used. All salts and chemicals used were of “pro analysis” grade. All of the data are expressed as arithmetic means ± S.E. For statistical analysis, GraphPad Prism software (version 4.00 for Windows; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used. Significant differences between means were tested by paired Student's t test or ANOVA. Statistically significant differences were assumed at p < 0.05 (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001); n corresponds to the number of independent experiments. The current density-to-time and current density-to-voltage relationships were fitted with second order polynomials (Y = A + BX + CX2). For detecting significant differences between those data, the extra sum of squares F test was applied. Statistically significant differences were assumed at p < 0.01. As previously described for the C. elegans IClnN1 (5Fürst J. Ritter M. Rudzki J. Danzl J. Gschwentner M. Scandella E. Jakab M. König M. Oehl B. Lang F. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. J. Biol.

Cells were transiently transfected with either the pIRES2-EGFP vector encoding for ICln or with the control vector pIRES2-EGFP-EGFP; for electrophysiological measurements, cells were initially kept in extracellular hypertonic solution. After the seal was realized and the whole cell configuration was obtained, IClswell activation was monitored following reduction of the extracellular osmolarity by 100 mm via omission of mannitol. Hypotonic shock induced the activation of a large chloride current with the biophysical fingerprints of IClswell (outward rectification, slow voltage- and time-dependent inactivation at positive potentials; Fig. 1a) in both control and I"

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Specifically, BABPs are found abundantly expressed in the enterocytes and hepatocytes of various vertebrates and have been shown to play a pivotal role in the transcellular trafficking and enterohepatic circulation of bile salts (4Argmann, C. A., Houten, S. M., Champy, M. F., Auwerx, J. (2006) Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2006, chapter 29: Unit 29B.2.Google Scholar). During the last decade a growing amount of evidence has been presented to show that the various FABPs that interact with lipids not only facilitate their transport in aqueous media but, by interacting with specific targets, also modulate their subsequent biological action or metabolism (5Lew J.L.

Thus, structural and mechanistic knowledge of the interactions between lipids and their cognate binding proteins has become mandatory in understanding the action of lipids as signaling compounds and metabolic intermediates (6Hamilton J.A.

The binding features of BABPs appear difficult to capture, although recent studies have set important milestones in the atomic level description of BABP-ligand interactions (7Tochtrop G.P. Bruns J.L.

It has been definitively ascertained that BABPs can form at least ternary complexes by hosting two ligand molecules inside a large protein cavity (11Tochtrop G.P. Richter K. Tang C. Toner J.J.

(Camb.). 2006; 44: 4623-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). One of the most intriguing features described for some members of the family relates to binding cooperativity, i.e. the energetic coupling between separate binding sites, a property that provides an additional level of signaling or regulation. Human ileal BABP (hI-BABP) and chicken liver BABP (cL-BABP) display an extraordinary degree of positive cooperativity associated with two internal binding sites, illustrated qualitatively by a Hill coefficient close to 2 (11Tochtrop G.P. Richter K. Tang C. Toner J.J. Covey D.F. Cistola D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1847-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Pedò M. D'Onofrio M. Ferranti P. Molinari H. Assfalg M. Proteins. 2009; 77: 718-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The two proteins can thus effectively sequester ligands from the intracellular milieu, suggesting that they play a role in offering cytoprotection against high concentrations of bile acids. Cooperativity often arises from allosteric communication, a phenomenon that frequently escapes detection by common biochemical approaches (16Smock R.G. Rivoire O. Russ W.P. Swain J.F. Leibler S. Ranganathan R. Gierasch L.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 414-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). NMR and calorimetric studies performed on hI-BABP and on a series of mutants have attempted to identify the communication pathways between the two binding sites (9Toke O. Monsey J.D. DeKoster G.T. Tochtrop G.P. Tang C. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Toke O. Monsey J.D. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Further interaction studies reported for other members of the BABP family describe the binding stoichiometry and affinity of the rabbit ileal protein (rI-BABP) (17Kouvatsos N. Thurston V. Ball K. Oldham N.J. Thomas N.R. Searle M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as well as the binding thermodynamics and crystallographic structure of fully complexed zebrafish ileal protein (zI-BABP) (13Capaldi S. Saccomani G. Fessas D. Signorelli M. Perduca M. Monaco H.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 385: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Along this line of investigation, we reported previously on chicken I-BABP (cI-BABP) (18Guariento M. Raimondo D. Assfalg M. Zanzoni S. Pesente P. Ragona L. Tramontano A. Molinari H. Proteins. 2008; 70: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Guariento M. Assfalg M. Zanzoni S. Fessas D. Longhi R. Molinari H. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 413-424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements supported by NMR titration experiments allowed us to establish a thermodynamic binding model describing two consecutive binding events. At variance with the human protein, a single bound cI-BABP was found to be relatively abundant at a low ligand/protein ratio, indicative of poor cooperativity. Indeed, a previous analysis of all available thermodynamic data for I-BABPs allowed us to place the proteins in an indicative cooperativity scale based on the estimated free energy of coupling (ΔΔG) between the internal binding sites. The two extremes were defined by hI-BABP (maximum cooperativity, ΔΔG = −15.50 kJ·mol−1) and cI-BABP (lowest cooperativity, ΔΔG = −0.87 kJ·mol−1). In the case of cI-BABP, analysis of the energetics of binding and of chemical shift perturbations (19Guariento M. Assfalg M. Zanzoni S. Fessas D. Longhi R. Molinari H. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 413-424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) further indicated that the first binding event triggers a global structural rearrangement associated with a substantial enthalpic contribution (ΔH = −50.3 ± 5 kJ·mol−1). The protein thus appears capable of establishing long-range interactions, although it displays poor energetic coupling between the binding sites. In line with the classical definition of cooperativity (20Cui Q. Karplus M. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1295-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), we thus proposed that cI-BABP behaves as an allosteric system, making it a promising model for exploration of the determinants of cooperativity. The goal of the present study was to gain more insight into the structural basis of positive cooperativity in I-BABPs through the comparative analysis of key interactions in proteins with different coupling energies. As a necessary starting point we determined the solution structure of cI-BABP in complex with two molecules of the physiologically prevalent bile acid glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDA). The structural details have been analyzed to guide the identification of key residues capable, upon mutation, of turning a low cooperative system into one displaying increased binding efficiency. The mutant analysis has the potential to single out functional interactions more directly than expected on the basis of structural comparisons between homologous proteins displaying a limited, but still significant, variability in amino acid composition. Single and double mutants were produced and ligand titration was monitored by NMR, as it was shown previously that NMR can capture the signature of cooperativity in these systems (11Tochtrop G.P. Richter K. Tang C. Toner J.J. Covey D.F. Cistola D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1847-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Guariento M. Assfalg M. Zanzoni S. Fessas D. Longhi R. Molinari H. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 413-424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The double bound wild type and mutant proteins were studied additionally by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to identify long-range communication networks at the basis of cooperativity. The present structural and binding data are discussed in terms of an “extended conformational selection” binding model (21Csermely P. Palotai R. Nussinov R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 539-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 22Reichheld S.E. Yu Z. Davidson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 22263-22268Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for the single (A101S) and double (H99Q/A101S) mutant were obtained from that of wild type chicken I-BABP using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit. Recombinant unlabeled (u-) and 15N,13C-labeled wild type and mutant I-BABPs were expressed as described previously (19Guariento M. Assfalg M. Zanzoni S. Fessas D. Longhi R. Molinari H. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 413-424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). u-GCDA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. [15N]- and [15N,13C]glycine conjugates of chenodeoxycholic acid were prepared as reported previously (18Guariento M. Raimondo D. Assfalg M. Zanzoni S. Pesente P. Ragona L. Tramontano A. Molinari H. Proteins. 2008; 70: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NMR samples were prepared in 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.05% NaN3 and 90:10% H2O:D2O or 99% D2O. A pH value slightly lower than the physiological value was chosen to facilitate the observation of NMR signals. Experiments repeated at pH 7.0 however demonstrated the equivalence of the experimental conditions for the purpose of this work. NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C with a Bruker Avance III spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz and equipped with a 5-mm TCI cryoprobe and Z-field gradient. Samples containing 0.4–0.8 mm [15N,13C]cI-BABP in complex with u-GCDA at a ligand/protein ratio of 4 were typically employed for three-dimensional experiments. The backbone assignment was available (19Guariento M. Assfalg M. Zanzoni S. Fessas D. Longhi R. Molinari H. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 413-424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whereas the side chain resonance assignment was based on (H)CCH-TOCSY and H(C)CH-TOCSY experiments. A three-dimensional NOESY-1H,15N HSQC and two three-dimensional NOESY-1H,13C HSQC (one in H2O and one in D2O) were recorded to obtain intramolecular NOE-based distance restraints for the protein structure determination in the holoform. F1/F2-15N,13C-filtered NOESY (mixing time 70 ms) and TOCSY (mixing time 80 ms) experiments were run to filter out the 1H resonances of doubly labeled protein allowing the resonances assignment of ligands in the bound form. Two three-dimensional F1-15N,13C-filtered, F2-13C-separated, F3-13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra (optimized for either aliphatic or aromatic residues) were recorded in D2O (mixing time 120 ms) for intermolecular NOE detection. The first transients of F1- 13C-edited, F3- 13C-filtered three-dimensional HMQC-NOESY experiments with mixing times ranging from 0 to 200 ms were acquired as described previously (12Eliseo T. Ragona L. Catalano M. Assfalg M. Paci M. Zetta L. Molinari H. Cicero D.O. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12557-12567Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 15N-Enriched-ligand/protein ratios of 0.3, 1, 1.2, 1.5, 2, 2.2, and 4 were employed in HSQC titration experiments on 0.4 mm protein samples (either wild type or mutants). Random samples, at different ligand/protein ratios, were prepared three times; spectra were accumulated under identical conditions, and the error on the measured peak volume was estimated to be on the order of 5%. NMR data were processed with Topspin 2.1 (Bruker) and analyzed with NMRView (23Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the protein-ligand complex was calculated in two steps: (i) determination of the protein conformation based on experimentally derived intramolecular restraints and (ii) data-driven docking of the ligand molecules into the previously calculated protein scaffold. This approach ensures the highest accuracy of the protein structure in the complex while exploiting the better capability of the docking algorithm to search the intermolecular conformational space (24Tomaselli S. Zanzoni S. Ragona L. Gianolio E. Aime S. Assfalg M. Molinari H. J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 6782-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For the first step, the intramolecular restraints were obtained from NOE cross-peak intensities identified in the three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC spectra and from secondary chemical shifts that were translated into the preferred ranges of backbone dihedral angles using the TALOS+ program (25Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). The structure was then calculated using the torsion angle dynamics program CYANA 2.1 (26Güntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). The CANDID module of CYANA (27Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar) was used for automated assignment of the NOE cross-peaks followed by a manual check prior to the final calculations. In summary, the solution structure was determined from 2738 NOE-based distance restraints and 221 chemical shift-based angle restraints. A total of 2959 restraints were used to generate 100 structures, and the 20 conformers with the lowest target function were chosen to represent the solution structure. For the second step of the structure calculation we used the software HADDOCK 2.1 (28Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar) in combination with crystallography and NMR system (CNS) software (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The starting protein coordinates were those of the 10 best structures of the final bundle calculated with CYANA. GCDA coordinates were computed with the SMILE program (30Eufri D. Sironi A. J. Mol. Graph. 1989; 7 (158): 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by adding a glycine residue to a chenodeoxycholic acid molecule. The topology and parameter files of the ligands were generated from the PRODRG server (31Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar). The protein was kept fully flexible during docking, although conformational searching was limited due to the presence of the mentioned intramolecular restraints. The ligands were considered as semiflexible segments, and their docking was driven by both computed interaction energies (the force field) and intermolecular restraints. The latter included: (i) ambiguous interaction restraints derived from chemical shift mapping data (19Guariento M. Assfalg M. Zanzoni S. Fessas D. Longhi R. Molinari H. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 413-424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and isotope-filtered NMR experiments and (ii) unambiguous intermolecular NOEs defined as upper distance limits of 6.0 Å between protein and ligand carbons. Histidines were defined as charged or uncharged on the basis of their chemical shifts at the specified pH (see supplemental Fig. S1). During rigid body docking, 4000 structures were calculated. A total of 400 complex structures selected after rigid body docking were subjected to optimization by fully flexible simulated annealing followed by refinement in explicit water. Electrostatic and van der Waals terms were calculated with an 8.5 Å distance cut-off using the OPLS nonbonded parameters from the parallhdg5.3.pro parameter file (32Linge J.P. Williams M.A. Spronk C.A. Bonvin A.M. Nilges M. Proteins. 2003; 50: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The resulting solutions were clustered using the algorithm of Daura (33Daura X. Antes I. van Gunsteren W.F. Thiel W. Mark A.E. Proteins. 1999; 36: 542-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with a 0.5 Å cut-off. The structures were divided into 12 clusters, and the best 20 structures were selected for each cluster. According to the HADDOCK score we defined a final bundle of 20 structures. The protein-ligand contacts were analyzed using the software LIGPLOT (34Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4434) Google Scholar), and the r.m.s.d. referred to ligand coordinates was calculated after all-atom fitting with PROFIT software. The coordinates and restraints were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 2LBA), and the chemical shifts were deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BioMagResBank code 17551). A phylogenetic tree was obtained according to the following methods. The evolutionary history was inferred using the minimum evolution method (35Rzhetsky A. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 945-967Google Scholar). The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method (36Zuckerkandl E. Pauling L. Bryson V. Vogel H.J. Evolving Genes and Proteins. Academic Press, New York1965: 97-116Crossref Google Scholar) and are in units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The minimum evolution tree was searched using the close-neighbor-interchange (CNI) algorithm (37Nei M. Kumar S. Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar) at a search level of 1. The neighbor-joining algorithm (38Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) was used to generate the initial tree. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the data set (complete deletion option). There were a total of 89 positions in the final data set. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 (39Tamura K. Dudley J. Nei M. Kumar S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25632) Google Scholar). Tree comparison was performed taking into account the work of Schaap et al. (40Schaap F.G. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 239: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The starting coordinates for the wild type protein were from the calculated NMR structures. The H99Q/A101S mutant protein was modeled by point mutations of the residues using the Mutator plug-in in VMD (41Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (27–38): 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39882) Google Scholar). Both wild type and doubly mutated proteins were simulated in explicit aqueous solution inserted into a cubic box of water molecules, ensuring that the solvent shell would extend for at least 1.2 nm around them. Gromos96, in combination with the simple point charge (SPC) force field, was used for the simulation. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method using a grid with a spacing of 0.12 nm (42Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Environ. Health Perspect. 1993; 101: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cut-off radius for the Lennard-Jones interactions, as well as for the real part of the PME calculations, was set to 0.9 nm. The LINCS algorithm (43Chau C.D. Sevink G.J. Fraaije J.G. Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2011; 83 (016701)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) was used to constrain all bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms, and the time step used was 2 fs. The systems were energy-minimized imposing harmonic position restraints of 1000 kJ mol−1 nm−2 on solute atoms, allowing the equilibration of the solvent without distorting the solution structure. After an energy minimization of the solvent and the solute without harmonic restraints, the temperature was gradually increased from 0 to 300 K in 200 ps of simulation. Each system was finally simulated for 50 ns. All simulations were performed with the GROMACS software package (44Van Der Spoel D. Lindahl E. Hess B. Groenhof G. Mark A.E. Berendsen H.J. J. Comp. Chem. 2005; 26: 1701-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (11665) Google Scholar). The module g_cluster was used to clusterize the trajectory with an r.m.s.d. cut-off of 0.1 nm. The latter analysis was performed to extract the representative structures of the most populated clusters, that is, the most visited conformations along the entire length of MD simulations. The analysis of structural features was carried out on the representative structures. The large scale motions were investigated by calculating the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of Cα atoms using the g_covar and g_anaeig modules of GROMACS. The residue-based root mean square fluctuations were calculated by projecting each trajectory on the first eigenvector. The hydrogen bonds formed during the simulations were extracted using the GROMACS program g_hbond. cI-BABP was shown able to bind at least two molecules of bile salt. However, previous NMR and thermodynamic data on cI-BABP (19Guariento M. Assfalg M. Zanzoni S. Fessas D. Longhi R. Molinari H. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 413-424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) had predicted a considerable concentration of singly bound protein over a wide range of ligand/protein (L/P) molar ratios, accounting for up to 50% of all protein when 1 < L/P < 2. The structural analysis of the singly ligated species was expected to be very informative for understanding the sequence of binding events. Therefore, we performed an analysis of ligand resonances at various L/P values in order to identify the conditions suitable for such a characterization. At L/P = 2 (supplemental Fig. S2) an intense signal in the two-dimensional F1/F2-15N,13C-filtered NOESY experiment of a [15N,13C]cI-BABP·u-GCDA sample, connecting the resonances at 0.42 and 0.57 ppm, was assigned to an exchange cross-peak between C18 methyl groups of unbound and singly bound GCDA. This assignment was confirmed by the fact that on increasing ligand concentration this cross-peak disappeared. Complementary NMR experiments, namely F1-edited, F3-filtered, three-dimensional HMQC-NOESY (12Eliseo T. Ragona L. Catalano M. Assfalg M. Paci M. Zetta L. Molinari H. Cicero D.O. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12557-12567Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with mixing times ranging from 0 to 200 ms, were performed (supplemental Fig. S3), confirming the assignments of all the methyl groups of the doubly and singly ligated species. It was thus possible unambiguously to identify signals corresponding to ligand in the singly bound protein; however, the complexity of the spectra prevented a rigorous structural analysis, and we focused the study on the double bound species only. cI-BABP forms a ternary complex with two ligand molecules (19Guariento M. Assfalg M. Zanzoni S. Fessas D. Longhi R. Molinari H. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 413-424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The major difficulty in the structure determination of the complex consists in the assignment of the two identically bound molecules of bile acids. The chemical shift dispersion of GCDA protons is very poor, but the presence of the three methyl groups, C18, C19, and C21 (see Scheme 1 for numbering), which appear in the unbound bile salt as two high intensity singlets (reported chemical shifts for C18 and C19 are 0.67 and 0.93 ppm, respectively) and as a doublet (C21, 0.95ppm) resonating at high fields (45Ijare O.B. Somashekar B.S. Jadegoud Y. Nagana Gowda G.A. Lipids. 2005; 40: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), constituted a good entry point for the assignment of the bound molecules. Two-dimensional F1/F2-15N,13C-filtered NOESY experiments performed on a [15N,13C]cI-BABP·u-GCDA sample with L/P = 4 were used to filter out 1H protein signals, allowing the observation of the GCDA resonances. Three high field resonating signals could be distinguished at 0.15, 0.19, and 0.42 ppm (Fig. 1). These resonances exhibited NOESY exchange peaks with intense signals at the chemical shift of free GCDA (in excess in the sample) and were assigned to the methyl groups of one bound GCDA molecule (hereby called GCDA-II). Specifically, the identification of C19 and C21, showing almost superimposed signals in the free ligand, was possible on the basis of a double filtered TOCSY experiment of the complex, where only the C21 methyl groups can display cross-peaks. If two molecules of GCDA are bound to cI-BABP, then a total of six different methyl signals are expected in this region in addition to those of the free GCDA. The resonances of the ligand bound to site I (GCDA-I) resulted coincident with those of free GCDA based on the following observations: (i) The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of u-cI-BABP·[15N]GCDA showed a single averaged resonance at 7.89 ppm for the amide group of free GCDA and GCDA-I, and (ii) the HACA and HNCA spectra of u-cI-BABP·[15N,13C]GCDA exhibited a single Cα chemical shift for the free and bound (to site I) ligand.FIGURE 1Identification of ligand NMR resonances. High field region of the two-dimensional F1/F2-15N,13C-filtered NOESY spectrum (mixing time 70 ms) of an 0.4 mm sample of cI-BABP in complex with GCDA at L/P = 4 is shown. The sample was dissolved in 30 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at 298 K. The assignment of the methyl groups of GCDA molecules is reported on the spectrum. GCDA-I, GCDA-II, and GCDA-f indicate the ligand bound to site I, the ligand bound to site II, and the ligand in free form, respectively. C18, C19, and C21 refer to the three methyl groups of GCDA"
https://openalex.org/W2045755505,"Okenone is a unique ketocarotenoid found in many purple sulfur bacteria; it is important because of its unique light absorption and photoprotection properties. Okenane, a compound formed by diagenetic reduction of okenone, is an important biomarker in geochemical analyses of sedimentary rocks. Despite its ecological and biogeochemical importance, the biochemical pathway for okenone synthesis has not yet been fully described. The genome sequence of an okenone-producing organism, Thiodictyon sp. strain CAD16, revealed four genes whose predicted proteins had strong sequence similarity to enzymes known to produce ψ-end group modifications of carotenoids in proteobacteria. These four genes encoded homologs of a 1,2-carotenoid hydratase (CrtC), an O-methyltransferase (CrtF), and two paralogs of carotenoid 3,4-desaturases (CrtD). Expression studies in lycopene- or neurosporene-producing strains of Escherichia coli confirmed the functions of crtC and crtF, but the crtD paralogs encoded enzymes with previously undescribed functions. One enzyme, CruS, was only distantly related to CrtD desaturases, was bifunctional, and performed a 3,4-desaturation and introduced a C-2 keto group into neurosporene derivatives in the presence of dioxygen. The enzyme encoded by the other crtD paralog also represents a new enzyme in carotenogenesis and was named cruO. CruO encodes the C-4/4' ketolase uniquely required for okenone biosynthesis. The identification of CruO and the demonstration of its biochemical activity complete the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway for okenone and other related ketocarotenoids."
https://openalex.org/W2069596403,"We performed genome-wide mutagenesis in C57BL/6J mice using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea to identify mutations causing high blood glucose early in life and to produce new animal models of diabetes. Of a total of 13 new lines confirmed by heritability testing, we identified two semi-dominant pedigrees with novel missense mutations (Gck(K140E) and Gck(P417R)) in the gene encoding glucokinase (Gck), the mammalian glucose sensor that is mutated in human maturity onset diabetes of the young type 2 and the target of emerging anti-hyperglycemic agents that function as glucokinase activators (GKAs). Diabetes phenotype corresponded with genotype (mild-to-severe: Gck(+/+) < Gck(P417R/+), Gck(K140E)(/+) < Gck(P417R/P417R), Gck(P417R/K140E), and Gck(K140E/K140E)) and with the level of expression of GCK in liver. Each mutant was produced as the recombinant enzyme in Escherichia coli, and analysis of k(cat) and tryptophan fluorescence (I(320/360)) during thermal shift unfolding revealed a correlation between thermostability and the severity of hyperglycemia in the whole animal. Disruption of the glucokinase regulatory protein-binding site (GCK(K140E)), but not the ATP binding cassette (GCK(P417R)), prevented inhibition of enzyme activity by glucokinase regulatory protein and corresponded with reduced responsiveness to the GKA drug. Surprisingly, extracts from liver of diabetic GCK mutants inhibited activity of the recombinant enzyme, a property that was also observed in liver extracts from mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. These results indicate a relationship between genotype, phenotype, and GKA efficacy. The integration of forward genetic screening and biochemical profiling opens a pathway for preclinical development of mechanism-based diabetes therapies."

NER has two operational modes: the global genomic (GG) NER pathway, which operates throughout the genome without distinction, and the transcription-coupled (TC) NER (NER) pathway, which specifically targets transcribed DNA strands in transcriptionally active regions of the genome (10Nouspikel T.

By studying the role of TR4 in UV light-induced cellular responses, we have now found that TR4 modulates transcription-coupled repair via CSB. Thus, this study provides evidence for a molecular link between TR4, CSB expression, and UV light-induced cellular responses, which may lead to new information on the treatment of UV light-sensitive syndromes, skin cancer, and aging. We separated and isolated mouse dermis-derived fibroblasts (MEFs) from the back skin of TR4+/+ and TR4−/− animals. The separated tissue fragments were minced with scissors and treated with 0.25% trypsin. MEF cells were isolated from day 14.5 embryos after removal of the heads and all internal organs; rinsed with PBS; and, after the addition of 5 ml of DMEM, passed through a 22-gauge needle several times to mince the tissues. The isolated cells were cultured at 37 °C at an atmospheric oxygen level (20%) in a humidified incubator. For knockdown of TR4 in cells, we used the pRetro-H1G retroviral delivery system (Cellogenetics) with AACGGGAGAAACCAAGCAATT as the targeted sequence. The expression vectors for CSB (pCI-CSB) and the parental vector were kindly provided by Dr. Jan H. J. Hoeijmakers (Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). Plasmids pCMX and pCMX-TR4 have been described previously (21Kim E. Yang Z. Liu N.C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). pRL-TK (thymidine kinase-Renilla luciferase), pGL2-SV40, and pRL-SV40 were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). For the CSB promoter-luciferase (Luc) reporter, a total of 961 bp of the human CSB promoter sequence was ligated into the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega), and the sequence of the construct was confirmed. The plasmid was designated pGL-CSB(−961). 5′-Deletion derivatives of the CSB promoter-Luc reporter were constructed by inserting different PCR-amplified DNA fragments (containing 661 and 301 bp of the human CSB upstream region) into pGL3-Basic using plasmid pGL-CSB(−961) as the DNA template. After different doses of UVC (254 nm) exposure, cells were incubated in 96-well dishes (1.5 × 103 cells/well) for 24 h. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reagent (Promega) was then added following the manufacturer's instructions. After a 4-h reaction, the absorbance of the converted dye was measured at a wavelength of 595 nm with background subtraction at 650 nm. This assay is similar to that described by Tran et al. (22Tran H. Brunet A. Grenier J.M. Datta S.R. Fornace Jr., A.J. DiStefano P.S. Chiang L.W. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 296: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were cotransfected with pBluescript plasmid that had been damaged before transfection by 5000 J/m2 UV irradiation, intact (undamaged) pGL3-Basic plasmids (used as the transfection efficiency control), and either pCMX-TR4 or pCMX vector control plasmid. 48 h after transfection, DNA was isolated from cells and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR. The GG-NER pathway-repaired plasmids were measured using T3 and T7 primers for pBluescript and GL2 and RV3 primers for pGL3-Basic. The relative amount of repaired pBluescript in cells was normalized to the pGL3-Basic PCR amount and then calculated by comparison with the vector control. MEF cells from TR4+/+ (WT) and TR4−/− (knock-out) animals were seeded and transfected with pRL-SV40 that had been damaged before transfection by 5000 J/m2 UV irradiation and intact pGal-SV40 plasmids (used as the transfection efficiency control). 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and luciferase and β-gal activities were measured. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-gal activity. (TR4 has no effect on undamaged pRL-SV40 luciferase activity (23Yang Y. Wang X. Dong T. Kim E. Lin W.J. Chang C. J. Biol.

Luciferase activity was normalized to β-gal activity. Transcription blockage upon UV exposure was checked by incorporation of [3H]uridine. Cells were exposed to 10 J/m2 UV irradiation and cultivated for different times as indicated. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing [3H]uridine (10 μCi/ml, 43 Ci/mmol), and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were washed two times with PBS and 6% trichloroacetic acid to remove unincorporated [3H]uridine. Lysis was performed by the addition of 2 ml of 0.1 n NaOH to the cells and overnight incubation. 0.5 ml of the lysate was mixed with 4 ml of scintillation mixture and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The incorporated radioactivity of the non-UV light-exposed probe was set at 100% (24Christmann M. Tomicic M.T. Origer J. Aasland D. Kaina B.

The removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from the transcribed or non-transcribed strand of the DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) gene was examined following the standard method with minor modifications (25Mellon I. Rajpal D.K. Koi M. Boland C.R. Champe G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For each time point, 30 μg of DNA restricted with EcoRI, which yields a restriction fragment spanning 20 kb of the central region of the DHFR gene, was split into two equal amounts. One sample was digested with T4 endonuclease V (T4 pyrimidine dimer glycosylase), which specifically cleaves UV light-induced DNA lesions; the other was mock-digested with buffer only. These samples were run in parallel on a 0.6% alkaline agarose gel under denaturing conditions and Southern-transferred onto Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) (26Spivak G. Pfeifer G.P. Hanawalt P. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The membrane was hybridized with biotin-labeled strand-specific RNA probes and then hybridized with HRP-conjugated anti-streptavidin secondary antibody and developed with an ECL kit. RNA probes complementary to the transcribed or non-transcribed strand of the mouse DHFR gene were synthesized from plasmids pDKR25 and pDKR5 (kindly provided by Dr. Isabel Mellon, University of Kentucky), respectively (27Plosky B. Samson L. Engelward B.P. Gold B. Schlaen B. Millas T. Magnotti M. Schor J. Scicchitano D.A. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The quantity of DNA damage was determined by the ratio of the hybridization signal intensity in the T4 endonuclease V-treated DNA to the signal in the mock-treated DNA at each time point in each cell type. For RT-PCR and qPCR analysis of TR4 and CSB mRNA expression, total RNA was isolated from TR4+/+ and TR4−/− mouse tissues or from cells using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). The relative abundance of target mRNA was quantified relative to control β-actin gene expression from the same reaction. The sequences for sense and antisense strand PCR primer are as follows: TR4, 5′-CATATTCACCACCTCGGACAAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGACGCCACAGACCACAC-3′ (antisense); CSB, 5′-CCACTCAAGTCAAACTCAGGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATCTGATGTCGGTCGATGTGC-3′ (antisense); and β-actin, 5′-TGTGCCCATCTACGAGGGGTATGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTACATGGTGGTGCCGCCAGACA-3′ (antisense). qPCR amplifications of reverse-transcribed first-strand DNA samples were performed using the iCycler iQTM PCR cycler (Bio-Rad). Relative quantification of PCR products was based upon value differences between the target and β-actin control using the 2−ΔΔCT method (28Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124877) Google Scholar). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate in assays performed three separate times. CV-1 cells were cultured in 24-well plates and cotransfected with plasmid pGL-CSB-Luc, internal control plasmid pRL-TK, and either pCMX-TR4 or pCMX vector. After 24 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity (pGL-CSB) was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity (pRL-TK). H1299 cells were cultured in 24-well plates and cotransfected with plasmid pGL-CSB, internal control plasmid pRL-TK, and either pRetro-siTR4 or a scrambled control. After 24 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase kit. Firefly luciferase activity (pGL-CSB) was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity (pRL-TK). For UV irradiation-induced luciferase activity assay, cells were seeded and transfected as described above. 24 h after transfection, cells were exposed to 30 J/m2 UVC light (254 nm). After different time intervals, cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed as described above for other luciferase assays. Western blotting and ChIP assays were carried out as described previously (5Liu N.C. Lin W.J. Kim E. Collins L.L. Lin H.Y. Yu I.C. Sparks J.D. Chen L.M. Lee Y.F. Chang C. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2901-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Liu N.C. Lin W.J. Yu I.C. Lin H.Y. Liu S. Lee Y.F. Chang C. Endocrine. 2009; 36: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The data are presented as means ± S.D. Student's t test was used for comparisons between groups. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. To investigate whether TR4 is involved in the UV light-induced cellular response in different cell types, we first compared cell survival following UV irradiation of WT (TR4+/+) versus TR4 knock-out (TR4−/−) MDFs. Compared with TR4+/+ MDFs, TR4−/− cells showed increased sensitivity to UV light-induced growth inhibition (supplemental Fig. S1A). We confirmed these results in H1299 lung cells, which express high levels of endogenous TR4. Cells expressing siRNA targeting TR4 or a scrambled control were exposed to different doses of UV irradiation, and the numbers of viable cells were measured 3 days later. Knockdown of TR4 again resulted in increased sensitivity to UV irradiation (supplemental Fig. S1B). Together, these results indicate a role for TR4 in modulating UV sensitivity in different types of cells. We next investigated whether TR4 modulates the UV light-induced cellular response through DNA repair. We first used an in vivo DNA repair assay (22Tran H. Brunet A. Grenier J.M. Datta S.R. Fornace Jr., A.J. DiStefano P.S. Chiang L.W. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 296: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) that monitors reactivation of promoter activity upon repair of previously UV light-damaged reporter plasmid DNA. TR4+/+ and TR4−/− MEFs were transfected with a UV light-damaged reporter plasmid (pRL-SV40). TR4+/+ MEFs displayed a greater reactivation of SV40 promoter-dependent luciferase activity compared with TR4−/− MEFs (Fig. 1A), suggesting that TR4 promotes DNA repair upon UV irradiation. Similarly, CV-1 cells that were cotransfected with the UV light-damaged pRL-SV40 plasmid and the pCMX-TR4 plasmid also displayed a higher reactivation of SV40 promoter-dependent luciferase activity than cells cotransfected with the empty pCMX vector (supplemental Fig. S2A). Interestingly, a GG-NER assay (22Tran H. Brunet A. Grenier J.M. Datta S.R. Fornace Jr., A.J. DiStefano P.S. Chiang L.W. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 296: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), bacterial pBluescript vector DNA, which is transcriptionally inactive in mammalian cells, showed a similar repair efficiency by the GG-NER pathway as measured by qPCR in CV-1 cells overexpressing TR4 or the vector control (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that TR4 is involved in TC-NER but not GG-NER. We then analyzed directly the integrity of TC-NER function in MEFs isolated from TR4+/+ and TR4−/− mice. The difference in repair kinetics between the preferentially repaired transcribed strand and the non-transcribed strand of the housekeeping gene DHFR was evident in the TR4+/+ MEFs, as 24 h after irradiation, DNA lesions in the DHFR gene were rapidly removed from the transcribed strand by TC-NER, whereas the non-transcribed strand was slowly repaired by the GG-NER pathway (Fig. 1C, first and second panels, and D) (30van der Horst G.T. van Steeg H. Berg R.J. van Gool A.J. de Wit J. Weeda G. Morreau H. Beems R.B. van Kreijl C.F. de Gruijl F.R. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, the transcribed strand was not repaired efficiently in TR4−/− MEFs (Fig. 1C, third panel, and D), similar to the non-transcribed strand in both TR4+/+ and TR4−/− MEFs (Fig. 1C, second and fourth panels), consistent with previous studies on the rate of repair of the non-transcribed strand (30van der Horst G.T. van Steeg H. Berg R.J. van Gool A.J. de Wit J. Weeda G. Morreau H. Beems R.B. van Kreijl C.F. de Gruijl F.R. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These results further confirm that TR4 is specifically involved in TC-NER. Because TC-NER deficiency is often associated with transcription arrest (17Proietti-De-Santis L. Drané P. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1915-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we also examined the recovery of RNA synthesis after UV exposure in MEFs. We found that 24 h after UV exposure, the recovery of RNA synthesis in TR4−/− MEFs was lower than in TR4+/+ cells (supplemental Fig. S2B). Thus, our data suggest that TR4 modulates UV light-induced DNA repair specifically via the TC-NER pathway but not via the GG-NER pathway. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which TR4 modulates the NER pathway, we examined the expression of a battery of NER genes in TR4+/+ and TR4−/− mouse tissues and cells. We found that CSB, a member of the TC-NER pathway, but not other NER genes, including CSA, XPD, XPC, XPF, XPG, ERCC1, and DDB2, was significantly reduced in TR4−/− mouse skeletal muscle compared with the TR4+/+ control (Fig. 2A). CSB mRNA was also reduced by 10-fold in TR4−/− MDFs and MEFs compared with TR4+/+ controls (Fig. 2B). We also examined CSB protein levels in C2C12 myoblast cells transfected with TR4 siRNA or a scrambled vector. As in mouse fibroblasts and tissues, the expression level of CSB protein was lower in TR4 knockdown cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that TR4 regulates CSB expression and are consistent with a role for TR4 in the TC-NER pathway. To dissect further the mechanism by which TR4 mediates CSB expression, we tested whether TR4, a transcription factor, directly regulates the promoter activity of the CSB gene. When we cotransfected the CSB(−961)-Luc vector along with either the pCMX vector or increasing amounts of pCMX-TR4 into CV-1 cells, we found that TR4 activated CSB(−961)-Luc transcription by up to 16-fold in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). We next identified the region of the CSB 5′-promoter that is essential for the response to TR4 by constructing two deletion mutants of the CSB promoter-reporter plasmid, CSB(−661)-Luc and CSB(−301)-Luc (Fig. 3B, left panel). The results showed that TR4-dependent transcriptional activity was reduced by 50% with CSB(−661)-Luc and almost totally lost with CSB(−301)-Luc compared with full-length CSB(−961)-Luc (Fig. 3B, right panel). Thus, the region between nucleotides −961 and −301 of the CSB gene is important for TR4-induced transcriptional activity. We then applied a ChIP assay to test whether TR4 binds directly to the CSB gene promoter and found that region −874 to −622 of the CSB promoter was efficiently recovered from immunoprecipitates using anti-TR4 antibodies but not from immunoprecipitates using control IgG (Fig. 3C), suggesting that TR4 directly binds to the CSB promoter. Together, these results strongly suggest that CSB is a direct target gene of TR4. The results shown above suggest that TR4 mediates UV sensitivity via regulation of the DNA repair protein CSB. To test whether reduction of CSB levels in TR4−/− cells is the key factor responsible for UV hypersensitivity in these cells, a CSB cDNA-expressing plasmid (pCI-CSB) was transfected into TR4−/− cells, and cellular UV responses in TR4+/+, TR4−/−/empty vector, and TR4−/−/CSB MEFs were examined. As shown in Fig. 4A, reconstitution of CSB increased the cell survival rate of TR4−/− MEFs upon UV exposure compared with TR4−/−/empty vector MEFs. This result strongly implies that the reduction in CSB levels in TR4−/− cells leads to UV hypersensitivity. It also explains the higher apoptotic rate of TR4−/− cells upon UV overexposure because CSB-deficient cells show increased apoptosis (31Balajee A.S. Proietti De Santis L. Brosh Jr., R.M. Selzer R. Bohr V.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because CSB may also be involved in oxidative damage repair (32Gorgels T.G. van der Pluijm I. Brandt R.M. Garinis G.A. van Steeg H. van den Aardweg G. Jansen G.H. Ruijter J.M. Bergen A.A. van Norren D. Hoeijmakers J.H. van der Horst G.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1433-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and TR4−/− cells are less resistant to oxidative stress (33Li G. Lee Y.F. Liu S. Cai Y. Xie S. Liu N.C. Bao B.Y. Chen Z. Chang C. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 3490-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we investigated whether restoration of CSB would confer oxidative stress resistance to TR4−/− cells. However, no difference in survival rate after H2O2 challenge was observed in TR4−/−/vector and TR4−/−/CSB cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that CSB alone might not be sufficient to rescue the deficiency in the oxidative stress defense system in TR4−/− cells. Thus, TR4 specifically modulates UV sensitivity through the DNA repair protein CSB. The TR4 nuclear receptor has been found to play an essential role in cellular signal transduction when activated by upstream activators/ligands, including polyunsaturated fatty acids, or higher concentrations of vitamin A (34Zhou X.E. Suino-Powell K.M. Xu Y. Chan C.W. Tanabe O. Kruse S.W. Reynolds R. Engel J.D. Xu H.E. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13353-13358Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that TR4 modulates cellular UV sensitivity through a member of the TC-NER pathway, CSB. UV irradiation is one of the major external insults to cells and is clearly linked to skin cancer (37Corona R. Ann. Ist. Super. Sanita. 1996; 32: 37-42PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the great improvement in understanding the NER machinery that repairs UV light-induced DNA damage (18Hanawalt P.C. Spivak G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 958-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 38Anindya R. Mari P.O. Kristensen U. Kool H. Giglia-Mari G. Mullenders L.H. Fousteri M. Vermeulen W. Egly J.M. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), some questions still remain. For example, how exactly does CSB function upon UV exposure? How is CSB function regulated? Our data demonstrated that TR4 directly modulates CSB transcription and thus provides a novel pathway in CSB functional regulation. Our results might also add one more dimension of mechanism to our previous finding that TR4 regulates the apoptotic response upon UV overexposure via Bcl-2 (8Kim E. Ma W.L. Lin D.L. Inui S. Chen Y.L. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 361: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) because CSB-deficient cells also have increased apoptosis (31Balajee A.S. Proietti De Santis L. Brosh Jr., R.M. Selzer R. Bohr V.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). p53 has been previously linked to the cellular UV response (39Shaulian E. Schreiber M. Piu F. Beeche M. Wagner E.F. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 103: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and p53 up-regulation was observed in CSBm/m mice (40Laposa R.R. Huang E.J. Cleaver J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but the TR4-regulated UV response is p53-independent because TR4 functions in the p53-null cell line H1299 (supplemental Fig. S1B). Thus, we have identified a new p53-independent signaling pathway in the cellular UV response. TR4 has been implicated in the oxidative response working as a FOX3a downstream mediator (33Li G. Lee Y.F. Liu S. Cai Y. Xie S. Liu N.C. Bao B.Y. Chen Z. Chang C. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 3490-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and TR4−/− cells have higher reactive oxygen species levels (41Lee Y.F. Liu S. Liu N.C. Wang R.S. Chen L.M. Lin W.J. Ting H.J. Ho H.C. Li G. Puzas E.J. Wu Q. Chang C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 301: E91-E98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A handful of studies also reveal the involvement of CSB in oxidative DNA damage repair (42Tuo J. Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Bohr V.A. Dizdaroglu M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 43Stevnsner T. Nyaga S. de Souza-Pinto N.C. van der Horst G.T. Gorgels T.G. Hogue B.A. Thorslund T. Bohr V.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8675-8682Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the hypersensitivity to oxidative stress was not alleviated in CSB-restored TR4-deficient cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that reduction of CSB levels alone is not solely responsible for the oxidative stress hypersensitivity in TR4-deficient cells. Other than regulating CSB transcription by directly binding to the CSB promoter (Fig. 3C), TR4 might also mediate CSB activity through an indirect mechanism. The luciferase reporter assay showed that the CSB promoter region between residues −661 and −301 contributes to the induction of CSB transcriptional activity by TR4 (CSB(−661)-Luc versus CSB(−301)-Luc) (Fig. 3B), whereas the ChIP assay indicated no direct binding of TR4 to this region (Fig. 3C). Further investigation is needed to determine the pathway involved in this indirect mechanism. Interestingly, TR4−/− mice demonstrate a number of the phenotypes observed in Cockayne syndrome patients, including growth retardation (3Collins L.L. Lee Y.F. Heinlein C.A. Liu N.C. Chen Y.T.

Biol. 2005; 25: 2722-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Does CSB deficiency contribute to these defects in TR4−/− mice? Further investigation is needed to answer these questions. Our findings illuminate a new aspect of TR4 function and reveal a new pathway contributing to cellular UV sensitivity and a new mechanism of CSB regulation, which may help to delineate a clearer and more complete picture of the cellular UV response and may aid in the development of new treatments for UV light-sensitive syndromes and skin cancer.

https://openalex.org/W1989359454,"The thermal properties of rhodopsin, which set the threshold of our vision, have long been investigated, but the chemical kinetics of the thermal decay of rhodopsin has not been revealed in detail. To understand thermal decay quantitatively, we propose a kinetic model consisting of two pathways: 1) thermal isomerization of 11-cis-retinal followed by hydrolysis of Schiff base (SB) and 2) hydrolysis of SB in dark state rhodopsin followed by opsin-catalyzed isomerization of free 11-cis-retinal. We solve the kinetic model mathematically and use it to analyze kinetic data from four experiments that we designed to assay thermal decay, isomerization, hydrolysis of SB using dark state rhodopsin, and hydrolysis of SB using photoactivated rhodopsin. We apply the model to WT rhodopsin and E181Q and S186A mutants at 55 °C, as well as WT rhodopsin in H2O and D2O at 59 °C. The results show that the hydrogen-bonding network strongly restrains thermal isomerization but is less important in opsin and activated rhodopsin. Furthermore, the ability to obtain individual rate constants allows comparison of thermal processes under various conditions. Our kinetic model and experiments reveal two unusual energetic properties: the steep temperature dependence of the rates of thermal isomerization and SB hydrolysis in the dark state and a strong deuterium isotope effect on dark state SB hydrolysis.

Meta II then activates the G protein transducin, setting off the visual signaling cascade (10Baylor D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 560-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Schiff base metarhodopsin II retinitis pigmentosa. Although rhodopsin is known to have single-photon sensitivity, more photons are required to elicit a sensation of light in humans (11Baylor D.A. Lamb T.D. Yau K.W. J. Physiol.-London. 1979; 288: 613-634PubMed Google Scholar). Visual sensitivity can be limited by two factors that cause aberrant, false visual signaling: discrete dark noise and constitutive activation of rhodopsin. Discrete dark noise was first observed in 1972 by Srebro and Behbehani (12Srebro R. Behbehani M. J. Physiol.-London. 1972; 224: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), who recorded electrophysiological signals generated by thermally induced chemical changes of visual pigments. The signals were identical to those generated by single photons. Baylor and co-workers (11Baylor D.A. Lamb T.D. Yau K.W. J. Physiol.-London. 1979; 288: 613-634PubMed Google Scholar, 13Baylor D.A.

On the other hand, in some rhodopsin mutants, the SB linking retinal to opsin hydrolyzes, resulting in opsin that can constitutively activate transducin, causing partial or complete saturation of the rod response and desensitizing dim light vision. Rao et al. (16Rao V.R. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) first demonstrated constitutive activation in the G90D mutant, which is implicated in congenital stationary night blindness. These previous studies suggest that rhodopsin must minimize thermal isomerization and hydrolysis of SB to function as a sensitive photoreceptor. Hence, the contributions of thermal isomerization and SB hydrolysis in the thermal decay process of rhodopsin are crucial to understanding dim light vision. The thermal properties of rhodopsin have been studied since the 1950s, when Hubbard (17Hubbard R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1958; 42: 259-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) observed that rhodopsin thermally bleaches at 75 °C in the dark. This raised the question of the mechanism of thermal bleaching.

Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2532-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) observed thermal isomerization in purified bovine rhodopsin and detected an increase of all-trans-retinal extracted from rhodopsin undergoing thermal decay at 55 °C in the dark. Around the same time, Janz et al. (19Janz J.M. Fay J.F. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16982-16991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Janz J.M. Farrens D.L.

They attributed the thermal decay not to thermal isomerization as Del Valle proposed but rather to hydrolysis of the protonated SB linkage, which yields unbound 11-cis-retinal and opsin. Finally, Lórenz-Fonfría et al. (21Lórenz-Fonfría V.A. Furutani Y. Ota T. Ido K. Kandori H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 5693-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) studied the temperature dependence of hydrogen-deuterium exchange in rhodopsin. They proposed a two-step model to illustrate the dark activation of rhodopsin, whereby the retinal-binding pocket opens transiently followed by thermal isomerization. They concluded that the sensitivity of rhodopsin is limited by structural fluctuations of the binding pocket rather than of 11-cis-retinal. Based on these studies, we wished to elucidate the mechanism behind the thermal decay of rhodopsin, specifically the contributions of thermal isomerization and hydrolysis of SB. We designed experiments to study the thermal processes of rhodopsin and showed that thermal decay consists of both thermal isomerization of retinal and hydrolysis of the SB (22Liu J. Liu M.Y.

Crystal structures suggested the presence of an extensive hydrogen-bonding network involving ∼20 conserved structural water molecules, hydrophilic residues, and the protein backbone in the transmembrane region (7Li J.

Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27622-27629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We discovered that at 59 °C rhodopsin undergoes thermal decay, isomerization, and hydrolysis of SB two or three times more slowly in D2O than in H2O, consistent with the fact that stronger hydrogen bonds form in D2O (22Liu J. Liu M.Y. Nguyen J.B. Bhagat A. Mooney V. Yan E.C.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 8750-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We also introduced the mutations E181Q and S186A to disrupt hydrogen bonds in the binding site of rhodopsin (23Liu J. Liu M.Y. Nguyen J.B. Bhagat A. Mooney V. Yan E.C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27622-27629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At 55 °C, the mutations increase the rates of thermal decay, isomerization, and hydrolysis of SB by almost 2 orders of magnitude compared with WT rhodopsin. Thus, we demonstrated the importance of the hydrogen-bonding network in stabilizing dark state rhodopsin and preventing thermal activity, which allows for dim light vision. Still, questions remain. We previously analyzed the data from thermal decay, isomerization, and hydrolysis experiments using single-exponential fitting (22Liu J. Liu M.Y. Nguyen J.B. Bhagat A. Mooney V. Yan E.C.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 8750-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Liu J. Liu M.Y. Nguyen J.B. Bhagat A. Mooney V. Yan E.C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27622-27629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, this method does not account for overlaps between the thermal processes measured by individual experiments, which precludes the solution of discrete rate constants. Our aim now is to achieve a quantitative description of all thermal processes involved in the thermal decay of rhodopsin, which will enable the quantitative analysis of effects on individual processes under various conditions, such as different temperatures, mutations, and isotope exchange. To this end, we have built a kinetic model containing two pathways of thermal decay (Fig. 1). In the first pathway, 11-cis-retinal isomerizes in the binding site of rhodopsin, thermally activating the photoreceptor; then the SB hydrolyzes to yield all-trans-retinal and opsin. In the second pathway, the protonated SB dark state rhodopsin hydrolyzes; then opsin catalyzes the isomerization of the free 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal. This kinetic model can be solved to analyze kinetic data obtained in the following four experiments that assay thermal processes (Fig. 1). First, we acquired the rate of hydrolysis of SB in Meta II independently by acid denaturation of Meta II followed by UV-visible spectroscopy. Second, using UV-visible absorption spectra, we measure the rate of thermal decay of dark state rhodopsin, which includes hydrolysis of the SB and isomerization of retinal. Next, using HPLC analysis, we measure the rates of thermal isomerization of the retinal, which includes the isomerization of both dark state rhodopsin and 11-cis-retinal free in solution in the presence of opsin. Finally, using UV-visible absorption spectra following acid denaturation of the sample, we obtain the rates of hydrolysis processes, which include hydrolysis of SB in both dark state rhodopsin and Meta II. In this paper, we describe our kinetic model, corresponding experiments, and the mathematical solution to the model. We perform experiments to measure the rate of SB hydrolysis in Meta II and apply our model to our previously reported data obtained for WT rhodopsin and the E181Q and S186A mutants at 55 °C and for WT rhodopsin in H2O and D2O at 59 °C (22Liu J. Liu M.Y. Nguyen J.B. Bhagat A. Mooney V. Yan E.C.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 8750-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Liu J. Liu M.Y. Nguyen J.B. Bhagat A. Mooney V. Yan E.C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27622-27629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Using global fitting, we determine the rate constants for all thermal processes, which allows a quantitative study of the effect of mutations, D2O, and temperature on the kinetics of individual chemical reactions involved in the thermal decay process (Fig. 1). Our analyses reveal two unique kinetic properties of rhodopsin: an unusually high isotopic effect on the hydrolysis of SB in the dark state and an extremely steep temperature dependence of rates for both SB hydrolysis and thermal isomerization. The results point to a sophisticated molecular mechanism behind the thermal stability of rhodopsin, which enables the protein to function as a sensitive photoreceptor. A better understanding of the thermal properties of rhodopsin at the molecular level could provide insight into the mechanism of visual diseases and the molecular evolution from cone to rod visual pigments. Recombinant WT bovine rhodopsin and the E181Q and S186A mutants were expressed in HEK293 stable cell lines and purified using the immunoaffinity method, as previously described (22Liu J. Liu M.Y.

The rhodopsin samples were concentrated to ∼20 μm in Buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, pH 6.5) for the kinetic measurements. For the D2O experiments, the sample was exchanged to Buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate in D2O, 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, pH 6.5) using a Biomax-30K NMWL centrifugal tube (0.5 ml; Millipore) as previously described (22Liu J. Liu M.Y. Nguyen J.B. Bhagat A. Mooney V. Yan E.C.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 8750-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We monitored the hydrolysis of the deprotonated SB in the active state of rhodopsin, Meta II, by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (22Liu J. Liu M.Y. Nguyen J.B. Bhagat A. Mooney V. Yan E.C.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 8750-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A volume of 0.1 ml of concentrated rhodopsin sample (20 μm) was photobleached by a 30-W illuminator for 30 s at 20 °C so that 11-cis-retinal was completely converted to all-trans-retinal by light, forming the active Meta II state. Immediately after bleaching, at time t = 0, the Meta II sample was added into 0.9 ml of Buffer A, which was equilibrated at 55 or 59 °C. At various time points, approximately ten 100-μl samples were collected from the cuvette, transferred immediately to precooled vials, and stored on ice to quench further thermal processes. Each sample was denatured by mixing with 4 μl of 1 m HCl. The pH of the solution was confirmed to be 1–2. The denatured samples were analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy. Retinal covalently linked to denatured opsin protein with a protonated SB absorbs at 440 nm, whereas free retinal in solution, the product of hydrolysis of the SB, absorbs at 380 nm. Hence, the amount of hydrolyzed SB can be monitored by the decrease of the optical density at 440 nm (A440). The measured A440 was normalized to the initial value, A440 (t = 0), and plotted as a function of time. The decrease of the 440-nm peak reveals the hydrolysis of SB. Thermal decay was monitored using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy as described previously (22Liu J. Liu M.Y. Nguyen J.B. Bhagat A. Mooney V. Yan E.C.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 8750-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In brief, to initiate the thermal decay process, at t = 0 a volume of 0.3 ml of concentrated rhodopsin sample (20 μm) was added into 2.7 ml of Buffer A, which was equilibrated at 55 or 59 °C. UV-visible absorption spectra were taken at various time points. The peaks at 280 and 500 nm represent the absorption of opsin and rhodopsin, respectively. Each spectrum was normalized to A280 to account for solvent evaporation. Over time, the 500-nm absorbance decreases. The accompanying increase in absorbance at 380 nm could represent formation of Meta II, the active state of rhodopsin, and/or free 11-cis- or all-trans-retinal after hydrolysis of the SB. Because Rho is the only species absorbing 500-nm light in the system, the concentration of Rho is proportional to the optical density at 500 nm (A500). The measured A500 was normalized to the initial value, A500 (t = 0), and plotted as a function of time. The decrease of the 500-nm peak reveals the thermal decay of rhodopsin. During the measurement of thermal decay, approximately twelve 200-μl samples were collected from the cuvette at various time points, transferred immediately to precooled vials, and stored on ice. These samples were divided into two parts for thermal isomerization and SB hydrolysis experiments. The extent of the thermal isomerization of the sample was monitored by extracting retinal in the form of retinaloximes from the samples and analyzing the isomeric forms using HPLC, as described elsewhere (22Liu J. Liu M.Y. Nguyen J.B. Bhagat A. Mooney V. Yan E.C.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 8750-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Six peaks were observed in the HPLC chromatograms, corresponding to 11-cis-15-syn-, all-trans-15-syn-, 13-cis-15-syn-, 13-cis-15-anti-, 11-cis-15-anti-, and all-trans-15-anti-retinaloximes (30Tsutsui K. Imai H. Shichida Y. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6437-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine the fraction of 11-cis-retinal at each time point, the area of the 11-cis peak was normalized to the sum of all six peak areas and the corresponding extinction coefficients for each isomeric form at 360 nm (30Tsutsui K. Imai H. Shichida Y. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6437-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The normalized fraction of 11-cis-retinal was plotted as a function of time. The decrease of the normalized fraction of 11-cis-retinal in the samples indicates thermal isomerization. Turning to the second component of thermal decay, we monitored the hydrolysis of the SB in dark state samples by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (22Liu J. Liu M.Y. Nguyen J.B. Bhagat A. Mooney V. Yan E.C.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 8750-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The samples taken at various time points during thermal decay were denatured with 4 μl of 1 m HCl and analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy. As discussed previously, the A440 is characteristic of an intact protonated SB, whereas the A380 is characteristic of free 11-cis- or all-trans-retinal. The decrease of the 440-nm peak reveals the hydrolysis of SB in dark state rhodopsin. All of the above experiments yield kinetic data that can be fitted into the kinetic model (Fig. 1) to obtain individual rate constants. To do this, we need to solve the kinetic model. Here, we first define the chemical species and the rate constants in our kinetic model (Fig. 1). The model consists of two pathways. First, dark state rhodopsin (Rho) undergoes thermal isomerization at a rate kisob to yield all-trans-retinal bound to opsin via an unprotonated SB (Tb), a Meta II-like state. The SB in Tb breaks at a rate khydT to yield all-trans-retinal free in solution (Tf). Second, Rho undergoes hydrolysis of the protonated SB at a rate khydC to form 11-cis-retinal free in solution (Cf), along with opsin protein. Then Cf isomerizes in the presence of opsin protein at a rate kiso to yield Tf. We are able to solve this kinetic model and apply it to obtain all of the rate constants (khydT, khydC, kisob, and kiso) governing the thermal processes of rhodopsin by performing four experiments: kinetic measurements of hydrolysis of SB using photoactivated rhodopsin (Meta II) and kinetic measurements of thermal decay, thermal isomerization, and hydrolysis of SB using dark state rhodopsin. Here, we relate the experimental observables to the kinetic model and solve the model to derive the equations that can be used to obtain the rate constants (see also supplemental materials). First, we independently obtained the rate constant khydT. The experiment measures a single thermal process, represented in our kinetic model as the hydrolysis of the SB of Tb at a rate khydT to form Tf. This is a first-order reaction, so the rate can be expressed as follows, -d[Tb]dt=khydT[Tb](Eq. 1) where [Tb] is the concentration of Tb. The solution can be written as follows. [Tb]=[Tb]0e-khydT⋅t(Eq. 2) and [Tb][Tb]0=e-khydT⋅t(Eq. 3) Because [Tb]/[Tb]0 is directly proportional to the normalized A440, Equation 3 can be used to fit the experimental data of SB hydrolysis in Meta II, the normalized A440 as a function of time. The fitting parameter in Equation 3 is khydT. Next, we considered the thermal decay of dark state rhodopsin (Rho). According to our kinetic model, Rho can undergo thermal decay through two pathways: 1) thermal isomerization at a rate kisob to form Tb and 2) hydrolysis of the protonated SB at a rate khydC to form Cf. Thus, the rate of thermal decay is the sum of the rates of thermal isomerization and hydrolysis of protonated SB and can be expressed as follows, -d[Rho]dt=(khydc+kisob)[Rho](Eq. 4) where [Rho] is the concentration of Rho. The solution can be written as follows. [Rho]=[Rho]0e-(khydc+kisob)⋅t(Eq. 5) and [Rho][Rho]0=e-(khydc+kisob)⋅t(Eq. 6) Because [Rho]/[Rho]0 is directly proportional to the normalized A500, Equation 6 can be used to fit the experimental data of thermal decay, the normalized A500 as a function of time. The fitting parameters in Equation 6 are khydC and kisob. Thermal isomerization of retinal measured in the experiment includes two processes presented in our kinetic model: 1) thermal isomerization of Rho at a rate kisob to form Tb and 2) thermal isomerization of Cf at a rate kiso to form Tf. Thus, the total concentration of retinal in the 11-cis conformation, [11-cis], is the sum of [Rho] and [Cf], [11-cis]=[Rho]+[Cf](Eq. 7) and the rate of thermal isomerization can be expressed as follows. -d[11-cis]dt=kisob[Rho]+kiso[Cf](Eq. 8) Substituting [Rho] from Equation 5 and integrating Equation 8 (see supplemental materials), we obtain the following. [11-cis][Rho]0=kiso-kisobkiso-(khydC+kisob)e-(khydC+kisob)⋅t+-khydCkiso-(khydC+kisob)e-kiso⋅t(Eq. 9) Equation 9 can be used to fit the experimental data of thermal isomerization, the fraction of 11-cis-retinal as a function of time. The fitting parameters in Equation 9 are khydC, kisob, and kiso. In the kinetic model (Fig. 1), two thermal processes involve in hydrolysis of the SB: 1) hydrolysis of the protonated SB of Rho at a rate khydC to form Cf and 2) hydrolysis of the deprotonated SB of Tb at a rate khydT to form Tf. Thus, the total concentration of all species with an intact SB linkage at time t, [link], is the sum of [Rho] and [Tb]. [link]=[Rho]+[Tb](Eq. 10) According to the model (Fig. 1), the rate of hydrolysis of the SB of rhodopsin can be expressed as follows. -d[link]dt=khydC[Rho]+khydT[Tb]=khydC[Rho]+khydT([link]-[Rho])=(khydC-khydT)[Rho]+khydT[link](Eq. 11) Substituting [Rho] from Equation 5 and integrating Equation 11 (see supplemental materials), we obtain the following. [link][Rho]0=(khydT-khydC)khydT+(khydC+kisob)e-(khydC+kisob)⋅t+-kisobkhydT-(khydC+kisob)e-khydT⋅t(Eq. 12) Because [link]/[Rho]0 is directly proportional to the normalized A440, Equation 12 can be used to fit the experimental data of SB hydrolysis, the normalized A440 as a function of time. Because khydT is determined independently, the fitting parameters in Equation 12 are khydC and kisob. Thus, we obtain four sets of data from four different experiments. One data set is independent: the rate constant khydT is found from the hydrolysis of SB in Meta II by fitting the normalized plot of A440 versus time into Equation 3. The other three data sets are interrelated: the data obtained from thermal decay experiment are fitted to Equation 6; the data obtained from thermal isomerization experiment are fitted to Equation 9; and the data obtained from hydrolysis of the SB are fitted to Equation 12 using the independently measured value for khydT. Our three experiments, thermal decay, thermal isomerization, and hydrolysis of SB, probe kinetic processes that are involved in both pathways: isomerization and hydrolysis. Hence, khydC and kisob cannot be measured independently. To obtain khydC and kisob, it is necessary to globally fit all of the kinetic data to the solution of the whole kinetic model (Equations 6, 9, and 12). The global fitting can be carried out using commercial software, such as Igor Pro. Three sets of data from three experiments are fitted using the fitting parameters representing the rate constants, khydC, kisob, and kiso. Thus, using our experiments and kinetic model, we can quantitatively determine all of the rate constants pertaining to the thermal processes of rhodopsin. We now demonstrate the application of our kinetic model to analyze our previous data for WT rhodopsin and the E181Q and S186A mutants at 55 °C and WT rhodopsin in H2O and D2O at 59 °C. To achieve this, we needed to perform new experiments to determine the rate of hydrolysis of SB in Meta II, khydT, for each condition. We first focus on WT rhodopsin at 55 °C to illustrate how to use the kinetic model to obtain khydT, khydC, kisob, and kiso. Then we report the results for the E181Q and S186A mutants at 55 °C and WT in H2O and D2O at 59 °C. The kinetic analysis of WT rhodopsin at 55 °C began with measuring khydT. Fig. 2A displays the UV-visible absorption spectra obtained in the Meta II hydrolysis experiment. The spectra were fit into two Gaussian functions centered at 440 and 380 nm. The fitted intensity for the 440-nm peak was plotted as a function of time (Fig. 2B). From single exponential fitting using Equation 3, khydT was determined to be 0.77 ± 0.12 min−1. Subsequently we used the measured khydT and applied the solution of the kinetic model to analyze the data for thermal decay, isomerization, and hydrolysis of SB. Fig. 2 (C, E, and G) shows the UV-visible spectra for thermal decay, HPLC chromatograms for thermal isomerization, and UV-visible spectra for hydrolysis of SB. The fitted intensity of the 500-nm peak, the fraction of 11-cis-retinal, and the fitted intensity of the 440-nm peak were plotted as a function of time in Fig. 2 (D, F, and H, respectively). Inputting the measured value of khydT (Fig. 2B) enables global fitting of these three decay curves using the corresponding Equations 6, 9, and 12. The rate con"

Because the extracellular domain alteration of receptors often influences the antitumor effect of therapeutic antibodies, it is essential to test the sensitivity of de4 EGFR(+) tumors to anti-EGFR antibodies. Therefore, in this study, the antitumor activities of mAb CH12, an anti-EGFRvIII antibody developed in our laboratory, as well as a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-EGFR antibody, cetuximab (C225), were characterized on de4 EGFR(+) models. The results of FACS assays showed that CH12 bound to de4 EGFR with a higher avidity than did C225. Interestingly, CH12, but not C225, significantly inhibited the metastasis and growth of U87MG-de4 EGFR xenografts, with a growth-inhibition ratio of 46.48% in vivo, and prolonged the survival of the tumor-bearing mice by 37.2%. Treatment with CH12 significantly suppressed tumor proliferation and angiogenesis with increased tumor apoptosis. Mechanistically, de4 EGFR protein expression was virtually undetectable in the U87MG-de4 EGFR xenografts treated with CH12. This may account for the observed reduction of Akt and Erk phosphorylation, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-x(L) expression and the increase of p27 and E-cadherin expression. Intriguingly, LAMP-1, a major component of the lysosome, was significantly up-regulated in the CH12-treated group but not in the C225-treated group, suggesting its contribution to the degradation of de4 EGFR. Taken together, our data demonstrated that mAb CH12 is a promising therapeutic agent for treating de4 EGFR(+) gliomas."

In the channels, Cl− ions passively diffuse down their electrochemical gradient, whereas in the transporters Cl− and H+ are coupled with a stoichiometry of 2 Cl−:1 H+ (7Zifarelli G. Pusch M.

Despite the different thermodynamic transport mechanisms, the overall architecture is conserved across the protein family (10Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

Campbell E.B. Hsiung Y. MacKinnon R. Science. 2010; 330: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) showed that the protein assembles as a homodimer with each subunit harboring a narrow permeation pathway containing 3 anion binding sites (Fig. 1, A and B). At the innermost binding site (Sin) 2The abbreviations used are: Sininternal binding siteScencentral binding siteSextexternal binding siteMTSmethanethiosulfonateMTSEH2-hydroxyethyl methanethiosulfonateMTSES2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonateMTSET2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonateITCisothermal calorimetry. the anion is still partially exposed to the intracellular solution. The central binding site (Scen) is located approximately halfway across the membrane, and is mostly contributed by conserved Ser and Tyr residues. The third and outermost binding site (Sext) is present in the structure of CLC-Cm in which the side chain of a critical glutamate residue, Gluext (Glu148 in CLC-ec1, Glu210 in CLC-Cm, and Glu211 in CLC-5), occupies Scen and in the structure of CLC-ec1 when Gluext is neutralized (11Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2003; 300: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In WT CLC-ec1 the side chain of Glu148 occupies Sext and isolates the anion at Scen from the extracellular space. In the E148Q mutant, an anion occupies Sext, whereas the Gln side chain is displaced from the pore (Fig. 1B). Gluext is crucial for gating and in CLC channels its mutations induce a constitutively open phenotype (11Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2003; 300: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 12Estévez R. Schroeder B.C. Accardi A. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M.

In the transporters Gluext is required for anion/proton coupling and its substitution transforms the antiporters into permanently open and pH independent anionic conductances (9Accardi A. Miller C.

The three anion binding sites provide a structural framework to understand the mechanism of anion selectivity of CLC proteins. Interestingly, the plant AtCLC-a is not a Cl−/H+ exchanger but rather a coupled 2 NO3−:1 H+ antiporter responsible for NO3− accumulation into the vacuoles (20De Angeli A. Monachello D. Ephritikhine G. Frachisse J.M. Thomine S. Gambale F. Barbier-Brygoo H. Nature. 2006; 442: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The different anion selectivity of AtCLC-a is surprising because polyatomic anions like NO3− and SCN− lead to uncoupling of anion and H+ flux in CLC-ec1 and CLC-5 probably by slippage (18Zdebik A.A.

Miller C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The molecular determinant responsible for the different selectivity for NO3− in coupled proton antiport activity has been pinpointed to a single residue in the central binding site. The conserved serine residue present in Cl−/H+ antiporters (Ser107 in CLC-ec1, Ser168 in CLC-5) (Fig. 1B) corresponds to a Pro in the NO3−/H+ antiporter. Substitution of the WT Ser with a Pro is sufficient to convert CLC-5 from a Cl−/H+ to a NO3−/H+ antiporter and confers higher NO3− permeability to CLC-ec1 and CLC-0 (7Zifarelli G. Pusch M. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Picollo A. Malvezzi M. Houtman J.C. Accardi A. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Chem. 2009; 284: 11184-11193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas the opposite substitution endowed AtCLC-a with coupled Cl−/H+ exchange activity (23Bergsdorf E.Y.

Gambale F. De Angeli A. Plant J. 2010; 63: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consistent with an important role of Scen in the coupling mechanism, structural analysis showed that anion occupancy of the central binding site of CLC-ec1 correlates with the degree of coupling with H+ countertransport (21Nguitragool W. Miller C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Accardi A. Lobet S. Williams C. Miller C. Dutzler R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These findings clearly indicate that the central binding site is critical for anion selectivity and anion/H+ coupling efficiency. However, the question remains as to whether other protein regions are also involved in anion selectivity. Several lines of evidence obtained from CLC-ec1 suggest that the internal binding site is not a likely candidate. The fact that anions at this position are still partially hydrated argues against a role in anion selectivity (10Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 11Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2003; 300: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, it has been suggested that Cl− binding to Sin is weak (22Picollo A. Malvezzi M. Houtman J.C. Accardi A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and that Sin is poorly selective between Cl− and SCN− (21Nguitragool W. Miller C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The external binding site is in principle another site potentially involved in anion selectivity but its role has been investigated only sporadically and importantly, for CLC transporters it has been probed only by mutating the conserved Gluext (18Zdebik A.A. Zifarelli G. Bergsdorf E.Y. Soliani P. Scheel O. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4219-4227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Picollo A. Pusch M. Nature. 2005; 436: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 26Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 27Accardi A. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Williams C. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). From these studies it was concluded that Sext does not have a substantial role in anion selectivity (22Picollo A. Malvezzi M. Houtman J.C. Accardi A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Accardi A. Picollo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1798: 1457-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, considering the complex role of Gluext, it is conceivable that its substitutions, besides modifying Sext, have drastic effects on general transport properties that can potentially hinder the detection of selectivity changes. Here we investigate the role of the external binding site of CLC-5 in anion discrimination by a different approach. A conserved positive residue (Arg147 in CLC-ec1 and Lys210 in CLC-5, but Trp209 in CLC-Cm) is adjacent to the important Gluext (Fig. 1, A and B) and is part of a sequence stretch highly conserved in CLCs from different organisms (Fig. 1C). The structure of the E148Q mutant of CLC-ec1 (11Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2003; 300: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) shows that Arg147 is in close proximity to the outermost Cl− ion with its side chain directed toward the extracellular space and its backbone probably participating in anion coordination at Sext (Fig. 1B). These elements potentially suggest a role for this residue in the discrimination between transported anions, a hypothesis that we tested on CLC-5 by substituting Lys210 with several amino acids. Our results indicate that a positive charge at position 210 is responsible for the NO3− over Cl− preference of WT CLC-5. Detailed analysis of the anion concentration dependence of transport suggests that Lys210 is primarily involved in regulating the voltage-dependent association of anions from the extracellular medium. Oocytes were obtained by dissection and collagenase treatment of ovaries from Xenopus laevis frogs. Mutations were introduced by recombinant PCR as previously described (29Accardi A. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All constructs were in the pTLN vector (30Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and were expressed by injecting 25–50 ng of cRNA transcribed from linearized cDNA from the Ambion mMessage mMachine SP6 kit. Oocytes were kept in a solution containing (in mm) 90 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, pH 7.5, for 3–6 days at 18 °C. Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed with a Turbotec 03 amplifier (npi, Tamm, Germany) and the custom acquisition program GePulse. Measurements were performed at room temperature (20–25 °C). Unless otherwise stated, the voltage protocol consisted of voltage steps from 120 to −60 mV in decrements of 20 mV from a holding potential corresponding to the resting potential of the oocytes (between −15 and −30 mV, a range that is typical for CLC-5 expression). Measurements of stationary current were performed by applying voltage steps of 20 ms to 80 mV every 2 s. The standard bath solution contained (in mm): 100 NaCl, 4 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. For measurements of anion selectivity, NaCl was substituted with equimolar amounts of NaNO3, NaBr, NaSCN, or NaI. For some batches of oocytes Br− and NO3− gave rise to small current increases in uninjected oocytes compared with Cl−. This small contribution did not affect the results obtained for the WT and the mutants with the highest expression, K210A, K210C, K210R, and K210Q, but had to be considered for K210E and K210H. On the other hand, in some batches, I− and SCN− significantly increased the currents elicited in uninjected oocytes. Therefore the results for I− and SCN− on all the constructs were corrected for their effect on uninjected oocytes in the following manner. The contribution of endogenous currents in the different measuring solutions was estimated for at least 3 noninjected oocytes. The average difference between the current in the different anions and the current in Cl− was then subtracted from the measurements in oocytes of the same batch expressing CLC-5. Solutions with the methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents, MTSEH (2-hydroxyethyl methanethiosulfonate), MTSES (2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate), MTSET (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate)), and with DTT (dithiothreitol) were freshly prepared the day of the experiment by dissolving in Cl− or NO3− bath solutions the appropriate amount of substance from stock solutions stored at −80 or −20 °C. The final concentration was 1 mm for MTS reagents (unless otherwise stated) and 10 mm for DTT, pH 7.3, adjusted with H2SO4 or NaOH. MTS reagents and DTT were purchased from Biotum (Biotium Inc., Hayward, CA). For measurements of [Cl−]ext dependence the extracellular solution with the highest [Cl−] contained (in mm) 300 NaCl, 4 MgSO4, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. Lower [Cl−] was obtained by substituting in a bath solution similar to the standard one (4 mm MgSO4 instead of 4 mm MgCl2) equimolar amounts of NaCl with NaAsp. For a quantitative analysis of the anion concentration dependence we assumed a simple saturating behavior (in agreement with the data) described by the following equation, I[anion]=Imaxanion[anion](K1/2anion+[anion])(Eq. 1) where anion can be chloride or nitrate, Imax is the current at saturating [anion], and K1/2 the concentration of half-maximal current. Thus, the dependence of the normalized currents on [Cl−]ext was fitted at each potential with Equation 2, Inorm=I([Cl])I(100 mM)=[Cl]×(K1/2Cl+100 mM)(K1/2Cl+[Cl])×100 mM(Eq. 2) providing an estimate of K1/2Cl. The dependence of the macroscopic currents on [NO3−]ext was analyzed by normalizing to the currents in the presence of 100 mm Cl−. Thus, these normalized currents were fitted with Equation 3, Inorm=I([NO3])I([Cl]=100 mM)=ImaxNO3[NO3](K1/2Cl+100 mM)ImaxCl100 mM (K1/2NO3+[NO3])(Eq. 3) using the value of K1/2Cl obtained from the fit of Equation 2. The fit of Equation 3 provides two important parameters: K1/2Cl, the concentration of half-maximal current in NO3−, and ImaxNO3/ImaxCl, the ratio of currents in NO3− and Cl− in saturating concentrations of both anions. The voltage dependence of K1/2 for Cl− and NO3− was fitted with a Woodhull model (31Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar), K1/2(V)=K(0)×exp(−zFVRT)(Eq. 4) where K(0) is the apparent binding constant for the anion at 0 mV, z is the apparent electrical distance of a hypothetical anion binding site, V is the voltage, F, R, and T have their usual meanings (F, Faraday constant; R, gas constant; T, absolute temperature). Data analysis was performed with a custom software (written in Visual C++, Microsoft) and the Origin program (OriginLab Corporation). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. Statistical differences were assessed using Student's t test. Proton transport was qualitatively measured by monitoring the acidification of the extracellular solution close to the oocyte using a pH-sensitive microelectrode as described previously (19Picollo A. Pusch M. Nature. 2005; 436: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Briefly, a silanized microelectrode was back-filled with a proton ionophore (Mixture B, Fluka) and a solution containing phosphate-buffered saline, and connected to a custom high-impedance amplifier. The electrodes were routinely checked and responded consistently with a slope of 57–61 mV/pH unit. The pH-sensitive microelectrode was gently pushed onto the vitelline membrane without rupturing the plasma membrane. Application of a series of pulses to a positive test potential under voltage-clamp induced acidification of the extracellular solution. Solutions contained 0.5 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.3). The microelectrode method cannot be used to determine absolute coupling coefficients but can provide an estimate of the relative coupling efficiency of anion/proton exchange comparing measurements in the presence of different anions performed on the same oocyte with the pH-sensitive microelectrode in the same position (7Zifarelli G. Pusch M. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We applied a train of defined length of activating voltage pulses and measured the final change in extracellular pH, ΔpH, and the net current during the voltage pulses, Inet, in the presence of Cl− or NO3− from the same oocyte. The current is the sum of the proton current, IH and the anion current, Ianion, and the latter is equal to ranion × IH, where ranion is the number of anions transported for each proton. Inet=IH+Ianion=(1+ranion)IH(Eq. 5) As a first approximation, the acidification is proportional to the proton current, ΔpH∼IH(Eq. 6) and thus Equation 7. InetΔpH=f(1+ranion)(Eq. 7) The proportionality factor, f, depends on the distance of the microelectrode from the oocyte surface, the local density of membrane expression, and other unknown factors. For the same oocyte and microelectrode positions, however, f can be considered identical for Cl− and NO3−. Therefore, the ratio of these quantities in NO3− and Cl−, respectively, defining the relative coupling efficiency, erel, as, erel=Inet(NO3)ΔpH(NO3)ΔpH(Cl)Inet(Cl)=1+rNO31+rCl(Eq. 8) is a measure of the relative efficiency of the Cl−/H+ exchange compared with the NO3−/H+ exchange. A large number of erel indicates that NO3− transport is less coupled than Cl− transport, i.e. rNO3 > rCl. To test the possible role of Sext in substrate specificity of CLC-5 we mutated the conserved lysine residue at position 210 to Ala, Cys, Glu, His, Gln, and Arg. All mutants gave rise to measurable currents (Fig. 2A) that, taking into account the variability of protein expression in oocytes and possibly a different turnover rate, had a magnitude similar to WT, except K210E and K210H for which the current magnitude was reduced (Fig. 2, A and B). Comparison of the macroscopic currents (Fig. 2A) shows that in general the behavior of the mutants is similar to WT. They display the strong outward rectification typical of WT (note the lack of current at negative voltages) (18Zdebik A.A. Zifarelli G. Bergsdorf E.Y. Soliani P. Scheel O. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and the characteristic quasi-instantaneous activation with an additional, residual, slow component (Fig. 2A). The voltage dependence in the positive voltage range also appears very similar with the surprising exception of the conservative mutation K210R for which the voltage dependence is decreased compared with WT (Fig. 2A). To obtain a more quantitative description of the voltage dependence we estimated the degree of rectification by calculating the ratio of the current amplitudes at 120 and 80 mV. The results reported in Fig. 2C confirm that K210R is the only mutant with substantially altered voltage dependence. To test whether the mutants have normal Cl−/H+ exchange activity, we assessed proton transport activity by measuring the degree of extracellular acidification produced by the activation of the constructs in Cl− containing extracellular solution at 100 mV and found that it is qualitatively very similar to WT (data not shown). Importantly, control experiments on noninjected oocytes did not elicit any detectable proton transport activity (data not shown). In conclusion, despite some minor differences, all mutants retained the basic transport properties of WT CLC-5. We next asked whether the mutations affected the anion specificity of CLC-5. The strong rectification of macroscopic currents of CLC-5 precludes an estimation of anion selectivity based on measurements of the reversal potential, which is traditionally the method of choice to investigate selectivity of ion channels (33Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar) and has been applied also to transporters that mediate macroscopic current at both positive and negative potentials, including CLC-ec1 (27Accardi A. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Williams C. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, as detailed under “Discussion,” the selectivity of transport proteins can be measured by different methods, in particular by comparing the current amplitude in different ionic conditions (33Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar, 34Eisenman G. Horn R. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 76: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The various methods, assessing different thermodynamic properties, are not expected to provide the same results (34Eisenman G. Horn R. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 76: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and therefore great attention has to be taken in comparing the selectivity obtained with different techniques. In this work, the selectivity of WT and mutant CLC-5 was assessed in terms of the relative macroscopic current that allows comparison of different anions according to the relative efficiency with which they are transported. To avoid confusion between this type of measurement and the selectivity obtained from permeability ratios (or other methods), we will refer to the anion discrimination measured in this work as substrate specificity for transport activity. Supplemental Fig. S1 shows representative current recordings of an oocyte expressing WT CLC-5 in extracellular solutions containing different anions (note the different current scale for SCN−). In agreement with previous reports (7Zifarelli G. Pusch M. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) we found that Br− slightly decreases the currents compared with Cl−, whereas the reduction produced by I− is much more pronounced. NO3− and SCN− increase the currents (18Zdebik A.A. Zifarelli G. Bergsdorf E.Y. Soliani P. Scheel O. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4219-4227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The ratio Ianion/ICl− of the current magnitude in the presence of a particular anion with the current in the presence of Cl− at 100 mV (for SCN− at 80 mV) and at a concentration of 100 mm, is shown in Fig. 3, B and C. In performing these experiments several problems have to be taken into account. First of all, for SCN−, due to the large increase in current magnitude, the ratio ISCN−/ICl− was calculated at 80 mV to avoid errors due to series resistance (Fig. 3C). Moreover, to compensate for possible drifts of the currents during the perfusion with different anions, measurements with Cl− solution were repeated after each anion tested. Finally, if endogenous currents were present their contribution was subtracted (see “Experimental Procedures”). In agreement with previous results (7Zifarelli G. Pusch M. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) the transport activity of WT followed the substrate specificity sequence, SCN− > NO3− > Cl− > Br− > I− (Fig. 3). Fig. 3B shows that with the exception of K210H none of the mutations significantly affected the relative specificity of Br− and I− compared with WT. However, considering the small effect we did not investigate this aspect in further detail. The effect of the mutations on relative specificity of NO3− was in contrast much more consistent and robust. In fact, with the exception of the conservative mutation K210R, all mutants decreased the relative specificity of NO3− (Fig. 3, A and B). At 100 mV, transport activity of WT CLC-5 is higher in NO3− than in Cl− with INO3−/ICl− = 1.6. In contrast, INO3-/ICl− is only 1.1 for K210H, whereas K210A, K210E, K210C, and K210Q reverse the preference of NO3− and Cl− (INO3−/ICl− < 1) with the strongest effect produced by the mutant K210A (INO3−/ICl− = 0.7). The strong effect of K210A on the relative NO3−/Cl− preference is also illustrated in Fig. 3A, which shows representative macroscopic currents in NO3− and Cl− for WT and K210A. SCN− robustly increases the WT current compared with Cl−, (ISCN−/ICl− at 80 mV is 2.8). However, ISCN−/ICl− is strongly reduced for K210A, K210C, and K210E and for K210Q transport activity is similar in the presence of SCN− and Cl− (Fig. 3C). The mutations with the largest impact on NO3− specificity, K210A, K210E, and K210Q, are the ones that also affect more strongly SCN− specificity (Fig. 3, B and C). Considering the strong effect of K210A on NO3− specificity, we felt compelled to provide additional evidence that this mutation preserved the transport properties of the WT. First of all, we analyzed the dependence of macroscopic currents of WT and K210A on [Cl−]ext. Fig. 4A shows the dependence on [Cl"

Compared with CEFs, Ski-CEFs exhibited enhanced TCA cycle activity, fatty acid catabolism through β-oxidation, glutamate oxidation, oxygen consumption, as well as increased numbers and mass of mitochondria. Interestingly, expression of PPARγ, a key transcription factor that regulates adipogenesis and lipid metabolism, was dramatically elevated at both the mRNA and protein levels in Ski-CEFs. Accordingly, PPARγ target genes that are involved in lipid uptake, transport, and oxidation were also markedly up-regulated by Ski. Knocking down PPARγ in Ski-CEFs by RNA interference reversed the elevated expression of these PPARγ target genes, as well as the shift to oxidative metabolism and the increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, we found that Ski co-immunoprecipitates with PPARγ and co-activates PPARγ-driven transcription. Overexpression of the Ski oncogene induces oncogenic transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs).

The nuclear oncoprotein Ski is a bifunctional transcription factor that either activates or represses transcription. Ski does not bind DNA directly (1Nagase T. Mizuguchi G. Nomura N. Ishizaki R. Ueno Y. Ishii S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but interacts with several DNA-binding transcription factors to regulate gene expression. In several instances, this mechanism, first described in studies with avian embryo fibroblasts, has been predictive of the role of Ski in mammalian development and oncogenesis. Notably, interaction of Ski with the TGF-β-activated Smad proteins results in transcriptional repression and is correlated with its oncogenic transformation of CEFs 4The abbreviations used are: CEFchicken embryo fibroblastPPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneETCelectron transport chainMTGMitoTracker GreenMTRMitoTracker Red.

Ski also functions as a transcriptional co-repressor with GATA1, PU.1, and the retinoic acid receptor in suppressing differentiation and promoting oncogenesis of human hematopoietic cells (8Ueki N.

In apparent contrast to its oncogenic activity in avian embryo fibroblasts, Ski was found to induce skeletal muscle differentiation in these cells (12Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Cell. 1989; 59: 293-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This in vitro activity correctly predicted a role for Ski in mammalian muscle differentiation in vivo and in vitro (13Sutrave P. Kelly A.M. Hughes S.H.

Chem. 2009; 284: 2867-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this case, Ski functions as a transcriptional co-activator in a complex with Six1 and Eya3 (14Zhang H. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2867-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ski knock-out mice display a dramatic reduction of skeletal muscle development (15Berk M. Desai S.Y. Heyman H.C. Colmenares C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2029-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), as well as the virtual absence of brown adipose tissue (16Zhang H. Regulation of Skeletal Muscle Development and Differentiation by Ski. Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland2009: 87-88Google Scholar). Transgenic mice overexpressing c-Ski exhibit a remarkable increase of skeletal muscle mass but a decrease of adipose tissue (17Leong G.M. Kee A.J. Millard S.M. Martel N. Eriksson N. Turner N. Cooney G.J. Hardeman E.C. Muscat G.E. Int. J. Obes. 2010; 34: 524-536Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In these mice, selective hypertrophy of type IIb fast skeletal muscle fibers is accompanied by increased lipid oxidation despite decreased expression of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a key regulator of lipogenesis (17Leong G.M.

These findings suggest that Ski plays a role in regulating lipid metabolism, perhaps mediated by an effect on the expression or transcriptional activity of PPARγ. PPARγ is a lipid ligand-activated nuclear receptor that regulates adipogenesis and has a complex role in lipid metabolism (18Lehrke M.

PPARγ also induces expression of its co-activator, PGC1-α, which stimulates fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and cell respiration in muscles and brown adipose tissue (25Wilson-Fritch L.

These data indicate that PPARγ plays an important role in cellular metabolism, promoting not only lipid transport, storage, and lipogenesis but also lipid oxidation. Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of oncogenic transformation. In general, cancer cells exhibit the classical Warburg effect of dramatically accelerated glycolysis under aerobic conditions (28Warburg O. Posener K. Negelein E. Biochemische Zeitschrift. 1924; 152: 319-344Google Scholar). This metabolic change also is noted in fibroblasts transformed by oncogenes such as Src (29Carroll R.C. Ash J.F. Vogt P.K. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75: 5015-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Levintow L. Eagle H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1961; 30: 605-640Crossref Google Scholar). These cells rapidly acidify cell culture medium due to the accumulation of lactate generated by glycolytic conversion of glucose. Primary CEFs, transformed by overexpression of Ski, exhibit many features common to oncogenic transformation (31Li Y. Turck C.M. Teumer J.K. Stavnezer E. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but surprisingly they acidify the culture media very slowly even after reaching confluence (32Stavnezer E. Reddy E.P. Skalka A.M. Curran T. The Oncogene Handbook. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1988: 393-401Google Scholar). It therefore seemed likely that Ski-CEFs produce much less lactate and therefore rely less on glycolysis than CEFs. This possibility taken together with results obtained from analyses of Ski transgenic and Ski−/− mice led us to investigate whether Ski might regulate metabolic energy production, perhaps by increasing lipid metabolism in concert with PPARγ. Here, we demonstrate that Ski has a profound effect on cellular energetics by decreasing the reliance on glycolysis and stimulating biogenesis of mitochondria and lipid oxidation. Primary CEFs were prepared and cultured as described previously (31Li Y. Turck C.M. Teumer J.K. Stavnezer E. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CEFs were transformed by retroviral overexpression of c-Ski in RCAS-Ski (13Sutrave P. Kelly A.M. Hughes S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1462-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PPARγ expression was ablated using a replication-defective retroviral vector that expresses shRNAs in the framework of microRNA-30 as well as the puromycin resistance gene (supplemental Fig. S3). Versions of this vector, RdpImiR30shRNA, expressing four different PPARγ-targeted shRNAs were co-transfected with RCAS-Ski using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) into CEFs. Seventy two hours after transfection, cells were selected with puromycin (4 μg/ml, Sigma). Survivors were cloned in 50% conditioned medium and screened by Western blotting to assess PPARγ knockdown. Medium was sampled every 4 or 24 h from cultured CEFs, Ski-CEFs, or PPARγ knockdown Ski-CEFs (PPARγKD-Ski-CEFs). Harvested medium was diluted 50 times for lactate measurement and 100 times for glucose measurement. The concentration of lactate in the medium was determined enzymatically using a spectrophotometric method (33Gutmann I. Wahlefeld A.W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1974: 1464-1468Google Scholar). The glucose assay was done according to the instructions of the glucose assay kit (Sigma). Oxygen consumption was measured with an Oxygraph-2K (OROBOROS Instruments). For intact cell respiration, cells were trypsinized, counted, and resuspended in growth medium at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml. For respiration in permeabilized cells, the cells were resuspended at the same concentration in Mir05 respiration medium (34Gnaiger E. Kuznetsov A.V. Schneeberger S. Seiler R. Brandacher G. Steurer W. Mitochondria in the Cold. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 431-442Google Scholar). The optimal concentration of digitonin (1.2 μg/ml) required to permeabilize cells was determined in a pilot experiment. Mitochondrial respiration was examined using specific substrates and inhibitors according to protocols described previously (35Gnaiger E. Mitochondrial Pathways and Respiratory Control. OROBOROS MiPNet Publications, Innsbruck, Austria2007Google Scholar). Heat generation of CEFs and Ski-CEFs (1 × 106/1.4 ml) was measured by isothermal calorimetry (Microcal), and growth medium alone was measured as background. The reference power value (30 μcal/s) and cell number were optimized by pilot experiments. Citrate synthase activity was measured as described previously (36Hoppel C.L. Kerner J. Turkaly P. Turkaly J. Tandler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23495-23503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To measure AlamarBlue® reduction, CEFs or Ski-CEFs (2 × 104/well) were plated in 96-well plates. Six hours after plating, cells were provided with fresh growth medium containing 10% alamarBlue® (Invitrogen). The plates were read at 590 nm for fluorescence intensity every 60 min. Data were normalized to total protein and subjected to linear regression analysis. Cells were suspended in growth medium at a concentration of 2 × 106/ml, stained with MitoTracker Green (MTG, 80 nm, Invitrogen) or MitoTracker Red (MTR, 100 nm, Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then briefly washed with pre-warmed medium and immediately analyzed using an SLR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data collected from 10,000 cells were analyzed by FlowJo. CEFs, Ski-CEFs, and PPARγKD-Ski-CEFs (2 × 106 cells/ml) were fixed with glutaraldehyde (2.5%), stained with uranyl acetate (0.25%), and embedded using a minor modification of the previously described methods (37Wang X. Su B. Fujioka H. Zhu X. Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 173: 470-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Thin sections (70 nm) were cut with an RMC MT6000-XL ultramicrotome, carbon-coated with a Denton DV-401 (Denton Vacuum), and examined with a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope. To measure stable isotope incorporation, cells at 80–90% confluence were switched into fresh medium containing 10% 2H2O and cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. Medium was removed and saved for percent enrichment measurements, and the cells were isolated and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Triglyceride concentrations and de novo lipogenesis were measured by mass spectrometry by the Case Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center as described by Bederman et al. (38Bederman I.R. Foy S. Chandramouli V. Alexander J.C. Previs S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6101-6108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The 2H label on triglyceride-derived glycerol and palmitate measured the amount of newly synthesized triglyceride and palmitate, respectively, which were calculated as described previously (39Lee W.N.

Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and real time PCR using the iCycler real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) were performed as described previously (14Zhang H. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2867-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The fold change in expression of each mRNA relative to ATPB3 was calculated as 2−Δ(ΔCt), where ΔCt = Cttarget − CtATPB3 and Δ(ΔCt) = ΔCtCEF − ΔCtSki-CEF or ΔCtCEF − ΔCtPPARγKD. Whole-cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted as described previously (14Zhang H. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2867-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies (mAb) used were as follows: Ski (G8 (41Zheng G. Teumer J. Colmenares C. Richmond C. Stavnezer E. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Lerner Research Institute Hybridoma Core Facility), PPARγ (E8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MFN2 (XX-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CYC (6H2, monoclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β-actin (Sigma), NDUFS3 (MS112), 70-kDa Fp (MS204), PDHE1α (MSP07), complex III subunit core1 (MS303), and porin (MSA03). Antibodies for the last five mitochondrial proteins are all from Mitosciences. Densitometry was analyzed by ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). 10 × 106 cells were suspended in 3 ml of growth medium in a flask that contained [1-14C]acetate (5 mm, 1 μCi), [U-14C]glucose (30 mm, 1 μCi), [1-14C]glutamate (1 mm, 0.5 μCi), [1-14C]octanoate (0.1 mm, 0.5 μCi), or [1-14C]palmitate (0.1 mm, 0.5 μCi) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The experimental protocol and devices used for trapping released 14CO2 were described previously (42Jomain M. Hanson R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 674-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of the 14C in the medium and 14CO2 were obtained by scintillation counting (Beckman Coulter). 2 × 104 cells (CEF and Ski-CEF) were plated per well of a 96-well plate and transfected with 20 ng of p-CMV-PPRE firefly luciferase reporter and 20 ng of pGL3tk Renilla luciferase reporter in the presence or absence of Ski expression plasmid. Twelve hours later, cells were treated with or without 10 μm GW1929. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection according to the protocol for the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega). For each experiment, at least six replicates were performed. Graphs were drawn and related statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism5 (GraphPad software). For data comparisons involving multiple variables, two-way analysis of variance was used. For comparisons involving two variables, we used Student's t test. Expression array data were normalized and analyzed by GeneSpring (Agilent Technologies) followed by ontological analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems). To establish the basis for the reduced acidification of culture medium by Ski-CEFs as compared with that of CEFs, we measured lactate production by both cell types during 24 h after medium change and during a 5-day time course. The resulting data show that Ski-CEFs produced about half as much lactate as CEFs during the initial 24-h period (Fig. 1A) and accumulated less than one-fifth the lactate compared with CEFs in 5 days (Fig. 1B). To confirm these findings, we next examined the consumption of glucose, the major source of lactate in the culture medium. As expected, we found that, compared with CEFs, Ski-CEFs utilized two-thirds as much glucose at 24 h and one-fifth as much in 5 days (Fig. 1, C and D). Reduced lactate production and glucose utilization indicated that Ski caused a decreased rate of glycolysis in CEFs. However, it did not seem likely that this reflected an overall reduction in metabolic activity, because Ski-CEFs appear to be the same size and to proliferate at the same rate as CEFs (12Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Cell. 1989; 59: 293-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To assess the metabolic activity of these cells, we measured the reduction of alamarBlue®, which is often used to assess the activity of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (43de Fries R. Mitsuhashi M. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1995; 9: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because alamarBlue® is reduced by cellular dehydrogenases that utilize FAD, NAD, and NADP as coenzymes (44Gonzalez R.J. Tarloff J.B. Toxicol. In Vitro. 2001; 15: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 45O'Brien J. Wilson I. Orton T. Pognan F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5421-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar), its reduction reflects the overall metabolic state of cells (46Al-Nasiry S. Geusens N. Hanssens M. Luyten C. Pijnenborg R. Hum. Reprod. 2007; 22: 1304-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the rate of alamarBlue® reduction by Ski-CEFs is at least 1.8-fold more than that of equal numbers of CEFs (Fig. 1E). Their decreased rate of glycolysis and increased overall metabolic activity suggested that Ski-CEFs have a higher rate of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux than CEFs. We thus examined this possibility by measuring 14CO2 production from [1-14C]acetate, [U-14C]glucose, and [1-14C]glutamate (Fig. 2). The results demonstrated that flux through the TCA cycle was accelerated in Ski-CEFs compared with that of CEFs (Fig. 2, A–C). Acetate, which enters the TCA cycle directly as acetyl-CoA, was oxidized 4.9 times faster. Glucose carbon, which enters the TCA cycle as acetyl-CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, was oxidized 3.5 times faster. Although they consumed much less glucose in 24 h than CEFs, about 10% of the total glucose utilized by Ski-CEFs was oxidized by the TCA cycle, whereas this ratio was about 2% in CEFs (Figs. 1C and 2B). Glutamate, which enters TCA cycle as α-ketoglutarate, was oxidized to CO2 6.7-fold faster by Ski-CEFs than CEFs (Fig. 2). Taken together, our data indicate that the overall rate of TCA cycle flux is about five times greater in Ski-CEFs than in CEFs. The combined results above suggested that Ski-CEFs have a high level of mitochondrial respiration. Two methods were used to measure mitochondrial respiration, heat generation and oxygen consumption. Isothermal calorimetry was used to measure heat production, which is a side product of cytochrome oxidase activity, the final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain (ETC). Ski-CEFs generated 2.6-fold more heat than CEFs, suggesting that a higher fraction of respiration might be uncoupled from oxidative phosphorylation in Ski-CEFs (Fig. 3A). To examine this possibility and to assess mitochondrial function in more detail, we measured oxygen consumption by intact Ski-CEFs and CEFs in the absence and presence of the ATP synthase inhibitor, oligomycin, and the uncoupling agent, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). We found that constitutive (routine) oxygen consumption of Ski-CEFs was about 2-fold greater than that of CEFs (Fig. 3, B and C). Upon treatment with oligomycin, this rate was reduced by an even greater extent in Ski-CEFs than in CEFs, indicating that oxygen consumption was coupled to ATP generation. The maximal uncoupled respiration of Ski-CEFs was 3-fold higher than that of CEFs, providing evidence that Ski-CEFs have greater oxidative capacity. The low level of residual oxygen consumption in both cell types after inhibition of complex III with antimycin A shows that the measured oxygen consumption was due almost completely to mitochondrial respiration. These results demonstrated that Ski-CEFs have not only a higher rate of respiration that is coupled to ATP synthesis but also greater overall oxidative capacity than CEFs. To determine the basis of enhanced respiration, we measured oxygen consumption by intact mitochondria of permeabilized cells in the presence of selective substrates and inhibitors (Fig. 3D). Glutamate and malate provided electrons via NADH to complex I of the ETC. Upon cell permeabilization, the rate of oxygen consumption decreased to a very low level because of depletion of endogenous ADP. This so-called “leak” indicated that only a minor proportion of oxygen consumption by mitochondria of both cell types was unrelated to oxidative phosphorylation. The stimulation of oxygen consumption by ADP in both cell types demonstrated a tight coupling of electron transport to ATP synthesis. Moreover, ADP addition increased respiration of Ski-CEF mitochondria to a much higher level than that of mitochondria from CEFs. By adding succinate to glutamate plus malate, electrons were fed simultaneously into complexes I and II. This resulted in a similar fold increase in the rate of respiration in both cell types, so that Ski-CEFs maintained the 3-fold higher respiration rate that was observed prior to succinate addition. Consistently, oxygen consumption in the maximally uncoupled state following FCCP titration was much greater in Ski-CEFs than in CEFs. Subsequently, inhibition of complex I by rotenone allowed measurement of complex II-dependent respiration only, which was also greater in mitochondria from Ski-CEFs. Mitochondria from both cell types showed virtually no basal respiration following inhibition of complex III by antimycin A. Finally, measurement of complex IV respiration by the addition of ascorbate and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine showed a similar difference between the two cell types, as observed for complexes I and II. Quantification of oxygen consumption showed that the rate of respiration by permeabilized cells had the same pattern as that of intact cells (Fig. 3E). Routine oxygen consumption by the mitochondria of Ski-CEFs was 2-fold higher compared with those of CEFs. When maximally uncoupled by FCCP treatment, permeabilized Ski-CEFs consumed 3-fold more oxygen than CEFs, which also was consistent with the intact cell measurements. Respiration with substrates feeding electrons into either complex I, complex II, or complex IV was increased about 3-fold in Ski-CEFs, as compared with CEFs. Thus, the enhanced oxygen consumption caused by Ski was due to a similar increase in activity of all ETC complexes and not to a selective effect on a specific ETC complex. In combination, the results demonstrate that Ski-CEFs had an enhanced mitochondrial oxidative capacity, which must have resulted from an increase in the number or mass of mitochondria. To determine whether Ski-CEFs have more mitochondria than CEFs, we first examined mitochondrial protein expression by immunoblotting. We found that expression of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins (MFN2 and porin), mitochondrial intermembrane space protein (CYC), mitochondrial matrix protein (PDHE1α), and mitochondrial ETC proteins (complex I subunit NDUFS3, complex II subunit SDHA, and complex III subunit UQCRC1) was greater in Ski-CEFs as compared with CEFs (Fig. 4A). In addition, assays of citrate synthase activities also indicated that the mitochondrial content of Ski-CEFs is greater than that of CEFs (Fig. 4B). This conclusion was confirmed by both flow cytometric and electron microscopic analyses. We analyzed CEFs and Ski-CEFs by flow cytometry, using both MTG and MTR, fluorescent dyes that covalently bind mitochondrial matrix proteins irrespective of mitochondrial membrane potential (47Presley A.D. Fuller K.M. Arriaga E.A. J. Chromatogr B. Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 793: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The observed increased fluorescence of Ski-CEFs compared with that of CEFs indicates a 2.2-fold greater mitochondrial mass per cell, which is consistent with their 2-fold greater routine oxygen consumption (Fig. 4C). Forward scattering data (data not shown) indicated that the increased mitochondrial mass per cell was not due to a difference in cell size between Ski-CEFs and CEFs. Finally, electron microscopy (EM) indicated that both mitochondrial number and size were increased in Ski-CEFs (Fig. 4D). We also assessed the number of mitochondria per cell by quantifying mitochondrial genomic DNA (mtDNA) by real time q-PCR (48Zhang H. Gao P. Fukuda R. Kumar G. Krishnamachary B. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 407-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Our results, normalized to a single copy nuclear gene, showed that these two cell types have the same amount of mtDNA per cell (supplemental Fig. S1). These results contrasted sharply with the data obtained with four other methods (Fig. 4), which clearly demonstrated that Ski-CEFs contain much larger and about 2-fold more mitochondria than CEFs. This increase in mitochondrial mass without a commensurate increase in mitochondrial genomes is likely due, in part, to differences in the number of genomes per mitochondrion in the two cell types (49Satoh M. Kuroiwa T. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular basis for the increased mitochondrial function and mass in Ski-CEFs, we explored global mRNA expression by Affymetrix microarray. Analysis of the results using GeneSpring and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software indicated that a cluster of 203 genes"
https://openalex.org/W2077605949,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the sequence-dependence of oligomerization of transmembrane domain 2 (TM2) of rat carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (rCPT1A), to elucidate the role of this domain in the function of the full-length enzyme. Oligomerization of TM2 was studied qualitatively using complementary genetic assays that facilitate measurement of helix-helix interactions in the Escherichia coli inner membrane, and multiple quantitative biophysical methods. The effects of TM2-mutations on oligomerization and malonyl-CoA inhibition of the full-length enzyme (expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris) were quantified. Changes designed to disrupt close-packing of the GXXXG(A) motifs reduced the oligomeric state of the corresponding TM2 peptides from hexamer to trimer (or lower), a reduction also observed on mutation of the TM2 sequence in the full-length enzyme. Disruption of these GXXXG(A) motifs had a parallel effect on the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of rCPT1A, reducing the IC(50) from 30.3 ± 5.0 to 3.0 ± 0.6 μM. For all measurements, wild-type rCPT1A was used as a control alongside various appropriate (e.g., molecular mass) standards. Our results suggest that sequence-determined, TM2-mediated oligomerization is likely to be involved in the modulation of malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPT1A in response to short- and long-term changes in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions that occur in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2170672891,"Members of system N/A amino acid transporter (SNAT) family mediate transport of neutral amino acids, including l-alanine, l-glutamine, and l-histidine, across the plasma membrane and are involved in a variety of cellular functions. By using chemical labeling, glycosylation, immunofluorescence combined with molecular modeling approaches, we resolved the membrane topological structure of SNAT4, a transporter expressed predominantly in liver. To analyze the orientation using the chemical labeling and biotinylation approach, the ""Cys-null"" mutant of SNAT4 was first generated by mutating all five endogenous cysteine residues. Based on predicted topological structures, a single cysteine residue was introduced individually into all possible nontransmembrane domains of the Cys-null mutant. The cells expressing these mutants were labeled with N-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate, a membrane-impermeable cysteine-directed reagent. We mapped the orientations of N- and C-terminal domains. There are three extracellular loop domains, and among them, the second loop domain is the largest that spans from amino acid residue ∼242 to ∼335. The orientation of this domain was further confirmed by the identification of two N-glycosylated residues, Asn-260 and Asn-264. Together, we showed that SNAT4 contains 10 transmembrane domains with extracellular N and C termini and a large N-glycosylated, extracellular loop domain. This is the first report concerning membrane topological structure of mammalian SNAT transporters, which will provide important implications for our understanding of structure-function of the members in this amino acid transporter family."
https://openalex.org/W2057351494,"Background P23H rhodopsin, a mutant rhodopsin, is known to aggregate and cause retinal degeneration. However, its effects on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of P23H rhodopsin in RPE cells and further assess whether LEDGF1-326, a protein devoid of heat shock elements of LEDGF, a cell survival factor, reduces P23H rhodopsin aggregates and any associated cellular damage. Methods ARPE-19 cells were transiently transfected/cotransfected with pLEDGF1-326 and/or pWT-Rho (wild type)/pP23H-Rho. Rhodopsin mediated cellular damage and rescue by LEDGF1-326 was assessed using cell viability, cell proliferation, and confocal microscopy assays. Rhodopsin monomers, oligomers, and their reduction in the presence of LEDGF1-326 were quantified by western blot analysis. P23H rhodopsin mRNA levels in the presence and absence of LEDGF1-326 was determined by real time quantitative PCR. Principal Findings P23H rhodopsin reduced RPE cell viability and cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner, and disrupted the nuclear material. LEDGF1-326 did not alter P23H rhodopsin mRNA levels, reduced its oligomers, and significantly increased RPE cell viability as well as proliferation, while reducing nuclear damage. WT rhodopsin formed oligomers, although to a smaller extent than P23H rhodopsin. Further, LEDGF1-326 decreased WT rhodopsin aggregates. Conclusions P23H rhodopsin as well as WT rhodopsin form aggregates in RPE cells and LEDGF1-326 decreases these aggregates. Further, LEDGF1-326 reduces the RPE cell damage caused by P23H rhodopsin. LEDGF1-326 might be useful in treating cellular damage associated with protein aggregation diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa."
