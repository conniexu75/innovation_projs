https://openalex.org/W2030594014,"EXTRACTS of rabbit skeletal muscle contain factors which play a part in the relaxation of muscle fibre models, such as glycerinated fibres1–3. Two of them isolated have been identified with known enzymes: myokinase by Bendall4 and creatine phosphokinase by Lorand5. But these two enzymes, coupled with their co-factors, do not settle all the problems of muscular relaxation because, in the light of our experiments, they do not have any relaxing effect on glycerinated fibres which have been preserved for a long time and exhaustively washed (Fig. 2a)."

https://openalex.org/W2026616356,"THE Actinomycetes have properties intermediate between those of the fungi and those of the bacteria. As in practically all bacteria and in many fungi, a sexual cycle is not known to occur in the Actinomycetes. In some bacteria and Fungi Imperfecti1, however, there are parasexual processes2, that is, processes leading to genetic recombination otherwise than via sexual reproduction. The present communication reports the discovery of a recombination process in an Actinomycete, Streptomyces coelicolor Reiner-Müller."

https://openalex.org/W4232078818,"SINCE thyroxine is known to decrease the efficiency with which phosphorylation is coupled to respiration1, the possibility suggests itself that vitamin B12 may function in hyperthyroidism by restoration, in part at least, of the energy-requiring functions of impaired cells. This has now been examined by a study of the following conjugation systems: acetylation of p-aminobenzoic acid, benzoylation of glycine, and synthesis of glutathione."

The effect of some antibiotics on the formation of indole has now been studied."

https://openalex.org/W2018949199,"MUCH confusion still exists in generalized accounts of life-histories of parasitic platyhelminthes concerning the position of the egg at the time of its maturation divisions and therefore about the exact time of fertilization. Indeed, it has been suggested1 that normal gametogenesis does not occur in many cestodes of the Cyclophyllidea, Tetraphyllidea and Trypanorhyncha. In a number of digenetic trematodes, on the other hand, it has been carefully shown by various workers, notably Chen2, Rees3, Stephenson4 and Willmott5, that meiosis in the ovum is normal and occurs in that part of the uterus immediately beyond the central chamber of Mehlis's gland. The ova move into the uterus at this point surrounded by yolk cells and begin maturation divisions at once while the shell is being laid down around the egg complex, which comprises one ovum, yolk cells and spermatozoa."
