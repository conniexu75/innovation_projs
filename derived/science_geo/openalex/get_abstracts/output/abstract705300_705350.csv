https://openalex.org/W4310603866,"Abstract Blood biomarkers indicative of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology are altered in both preclinical and symptomatic stages of the disease. Distinctive biomarkers may be optimal for the identification of AD pathology or monitoring of disease progression. Blood biomarkers that correlate with changes in cognition and atrophy during the course of the disease could be used in clinical trials to identify successful interventions and thereby accelerate the development of efficient therapies. When disease-modifying treatments become approved for use, efficient blood-based biomarkers might also inform on treatment implementation and management in clinical practice. In the BioFINDER-1 cohort, plasma phosphorylated (p)-tau231 and amyloid-β42/40 ratio were more changed at lower thresholds of amyloid pathology. Longitudinally, however, only p-tau217 demonstrated marked amyloid-dependent changes over 4–6 years in both preclinical and symptomatic stages of the disease, with no such changes observed in p-tau231, p-tau181, amyloid-β42/40, glial acidic fibrillary protein or neurofilament light. Only longitudinal increases of p-tau217 were also associated with clinical deterioration and brain atrophy in preclinical AD. The selective longitudinal increase of p-tau217 and its associations with cognitive decline and atrophy was confirmed in an independent cohort (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention). These findings support the differential association of plasma biomarkers with disease development and strongly highlight p-tau217 as a surrogate marker of disease progression in preclinical and prodromal AD, with impact for the development of new disease-modifying treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4310600666,"Abstract The post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) refers to a broad spectrum of symptoms and signs that are persistent, exacerbated or newly incident in the period after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most studies have examined these conditions individually without providing evidence on co-occurring conditions. In this study, we leveraged the electronic health record data of two large cohorts, INSIGHT and OneFlorida+, from the national Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. We created a development cohort from INSIGHT and a validation cohort from OneFlorida+ including 20,881 and 13,724 patients, respectively, who were SARS-CoV-2 infected, and we investigated their newly incident diagnoses 30–180 days after a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Through machine learning analysis of over 137 symptoms and conditions, we identified four reproducible PASC subphenotypes, dominated by cardiac and renal (including 33.75% and 25.43% of the patients in the development and validation cohorts); respiratory, sleep and anxiety (32.75% and 38.48%); musculoskeletal and nervous system (23.37% and 23.35%); and digestive and respiratory system (10.14% and 12.74%) sequelae. These subphenotypes were associated with distinct patient demographics, underlying conditions before SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute infection phase severity. Our study provides insights into the heterogeneity of PASC and may inform stratified decision-making in the management of PASC conditions."

https://openalex.org/W4310494061,"Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common, debilitating, chronic disease with no disease-modifying drug approved to date. We discovered LNA043—a derivative of angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3)—as a potent chondrogenesis inducer using a phenotypic screen with human mesenchymal stem cells. We show that LNA043 promotes chondrogenesis and cartilage matrix synthesis in vitro and regenerates hyaline articular cartilage in preclinical OA and cartilage injury models in vivo. LNA043 exerts at least part of these effects through binding to the fibronectin receptor, integrin α 5 β 1 on mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes. In a first-in-human (phase 1), randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose, single-center trial ( NCT02491281 ; sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceuticals), 28 patients with knee OA were injected intra-articularly with LNA043 or placebo (3:1 ratio) either 2 h, 7 d or 21 d before total knee replacement. LNA043 met its primary safety endpoint and showed short serum pharmacokinetics, cartilage penetration and a lack of immunogenicity (secondary endpoints). Post-hoc transcriptomics profiling of cartilage revealed that a single LNA043 injection reverses the OA transcriptome signature over at least 21 d, inducing the expression of hyaline cartilage matrix components and anabolic signaling pathways, while suppressing mediators of OA progression. LNA043 is a novel disease-modifying OA drug candidate that is currently in a phase 2b trial ( NCT04864392 ) in patients with knee OA."
https://openalex.org/W4313279459,"We report genome-wide data from 33 Ashkenazi Jews (AJ), dated to the 14th century, obtained following a salvage excavation at the medieval Jewish cemetery of Erfurt, Germany. The Erfurt individuals are genetically similar to modern AJ, but they show more variability in Eastern European-related ancestry than modern AJ. A third of the Erfurt individuals carried a mitochondrial lineage common in modern AJ and eight carried pathogenic variants known to affect AJ today. These observations, together with high levels of runs of homozygosity, suggest that the Erfurt community had already experienced the major reduction in size that affected modern AJ. The Erfurt bottleneck was more severe, implying substructure in medieval AJ. Overall, our results suggest that the AJ founder event and the acquisition of the main sources of ancestry pre-dated the 14th century and highlight late medieval genetic heterogeneity no longer present in modern AJ."
https://openalex.org/W4310578884,"Despite being a priority population for COVID-19 vaccination, limited data are available regarding acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Sub-Saharan Africa. We described COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and factors associated with vaccine acceptability among PLWH in Uganda.This was a cross-sectional study conducted among PLWH, aged ≥18 years, enrolled participants who were seeking HIV care from six purposely selected accredited ART clinics in Kampala. We obtained data on vaccine acceptability defined as willingness to accept any of the available COVID-19 vaccines using interviewer-administered questionnaires. In addition, we assessed vaccination status, complacency regarding COVID-19 disease, vaccine confidence, and vaccine convenience. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptability were evaluated using modified Poisson regression with robust standard errors.We enrolled 767 participants of whom 485 (63%) were women. The median age was 33 years [interquartile range (IQR) 28-40] for women and 40 years [IQR], (34-47) for men. Of the respondents 534 (69.6%,95% confidence interval [CI]: 66.3%-72.8%) reported receiving at least one vaccine dose, with women significantly more likely than men to have been vaccinated (73% vs. 63%; p = 0.003). Among the unvaccinated 169 (72.7%, 95% CI: 66.6%-78.0%) were willing to accept vaccination, had greater vaccine confidence (85.9% had strong belief that the vaccines were effective; 81.9% that they were beneficial and 71% safe for PLWH; 90.5% had trust in health care professionals or 77.4% top government officials), and believed that it would be easy to obtain a vaccine if one decided to be vaccinated (83.6%). Vaccine acceptability was positively associated with greater vaccine confidence (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.44; 95% CI: 1.08-1.90), and positive perception that it would be easy to obtain a vaccine (aPR 1.57; 95% CI: 1.26-1.96).vaccine acceptance was high among this cohort of PLWH, and was positively associated with greater vaccine confidence, and perceived easiness (convince) to obtained the vaccine. Building vaccine confidence and making vaccines easily accessible should be a priority for vaccination programs targeting PLWH."
https://openalex.org/W4310595373,"Dietary interventions may best be delivered at supermarkets, which offer convenience, accessibility, full food inventories and, increasingly, in-store registered dietitians, online shopping and delivery services. In collaboration with a large retail supermarket chain, we conducted a multisite supermarket and web-based intervention targeting nutrition trial (no. NCT03895580), randomizing participants (n = 247 (139 women and 108 men)) 2:2:1 to two levels of dietary education (Strategy 1 and Strategy 2) or an enhanced control group that included educational components beyond the routine standard of care. Both Strategies 1 and 2 included individualized, in-person, dietitian-led, purchasing data-guided interventions. Strategy 2 also included online tools for shopping, home delivery, selection of healthier purchases, meal planning and healthy recipes. The primary endpoint was change in dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score (a measure of adherence to the DASH diet) from baseline to 3 months. The primary endpoint was met because, at 3 months, the DASH score increased by 4.7 more for the combined Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 groups than for the control group (95% confidence interval (CI) (0.9, 8.5), P = 0.02). In a prespecified hierarchical test, at 3 months, DASH score increased by 3.8 more for the Strategy 2 group than for the Strategy 1 group (95% CI (0.8, 6.)9, P = 0.01). This trial demonstrates the efficacy of data-guided, supermarket-based, dietary interventions and modern online shopping tools in improving dietary quality in a free-living, community-based population. The trial also demonstrates the opportunity for academic investigators to collaborate with retailers to design and rigorously test comprehensive healthcare interventions."

https://openalex.org/W4310576422,"The search for new biomarkers that allow an early diagnosis in sepsis and predict its evolution has become a necessity in medicine. The objective of this study is to identify, through omics techniques, potential protein biomarkers that are expressed in patients with sepsis and their relationship with organ dysfunction and mortality.Prospective, observational and single-center study that included adult patients (≥ 18 years) who were admitted to a tertiary hospital and who met the criteria for sepsis. A mass spectrometry-based approach was used to analyze the plasma proteins in the enrolled subjects. Subsequently, using recursive feature elimination classification and cross-validation with a vector classifier, an association of these proteins with mortality and organ dysfunction was established. The protein-protein interaction network was analyzed with String software.141 patients were enrolled in this study. Mass spectrometry identified 177 proteins. Of all of them, and by recursive feature elimination, nine proteins (GPX3, APOB, ORM1, SERPINF1, LYZ, C8A, CD14, APOC3 and C1QC) were associated with organ dysfunction (SOFA > 6) with an accuracy of 0.82 ± 0.06, precision of 0.85 ± 0.093, sensitivity 0.81 ± 0.10, specificity 0.84 ± 0.10 and AUC 0.82 ± 0.06. Twenty-two proteins (CLU, LUM, APOL1, SAA1, CLEBC3B, C8A, ITIH4, KNG1, AGT, C7, SAA2, APOH, HRG, AFM, APOE, APOC1, C1S, SERPINC1, IGFALS, KLKB1, CFB and BTD) were associated with mortality with an accuracy of 0.86 ± 0.05, a precision of 0.91 ± 0.05, a sensitivity of 0.91 ± 0.05, a specificity of 0.72 ± 0.17, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 ± 0.08 with a confidence interval of 95%.In sepsis there are proteomic patterns associated with organ dysfunction and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4310576425,"There is an increasing interest in the field of audiology and speech communication to measure the effort that it takes to listen in noisy environments, with obvious implications for populations suffering from hearing loss. Pupillometry offers one avenue to make progress in this enterprise but important methodological questions remain to be addressed before such tools can serve practical applications. Typically, cocktail-party situations may occur in less-than-ideal lighting conditions, e.g. a pub or a restaurant, and it is unclear how robust pupil dynamics are to luminance changes. In this study, we first used a well-known paradigm where sentences were presented at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), all conducive of good intelligibility. This enabled us to replicate findings, e.g. a larger and later peak pupil dilation (PPD) at adverse SNR, or when the sentences were misunderstood, and to investigate the dependency of the PPD on sentence duration. A second experiment reiterated two of the SNR levels, 0 and +14 dB, but measured at 0, 75, and 220 lux. The results showed that the impact of luminance on the SNR effect was non-monotonic (sub-optimal in darkness or in bright light), and as such, there is no trivial way to derive pupillary metrics that are robust to differences in background light, posing considerable constraints for applications of pupillometry in daily life. Our findings raise an under-examined but crucial issue when designing and understanding listening effort studies using pupillometry, and offer important insights to future clinical application of pupillometry across sites."
https://openalex.org/W4311168415,"Adherens junctions (AJs) create spatially, chemically and mechanically discrete microdomains at cellular interfaces. Here, using a mechanogenetic platform that generates artificial AJs with controlled protein localization, clustering and mechanical loading, we find that AJs also organize proteolytic hotspots for γ-secretase with a spatially regulated substrate selectivity that is critical in the processing of Notch and other transmembrane proteins. Membrane microdomains outside of AJs exclusively organize Notch ligand–receptor engagement (LRE microdomains) to initiate receptor activation. Conversely, membrane microdomains within AJs exclusively serve to coordinate regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP microdomains). They do so by concentrating γ-secretase and primed receptors while excluding full-length Notch. AJs induce these functionally distinct microdomains by means of lipid-dependent γ-secretase recruitment and size-dependent protein segregation. By excluding full-length Notch from RIP microdomains, AJs prevent inappropriate enzyme–substrate interactions and suppress spurious Notch activation. Ligand-induced ectodomain shedding eliminates size-dependent segregation, releasing Notch to translocate into AJs for processing by γ-secretase. This mechanism directs radial differentiation of ventricular zone-neural progenitor cells in vivo and more broadly regulates the proteolysis of other large cell-surface receptors such as amyloid precursor protein. These findings suggest an unprecedented role of AJs in creating size-selective spatial switches that choreograph γ-secretase processing of multiple transmembrane proteins regulating development, homeostasis and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4310576419,"Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are a promising approach to accurately predict an individual's risk of developing disease. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of PRSs in their population are often only reported for models that are adjusted for age and sex, which are known risk factors for the disease of interest and confound the association between the PRS and the disease. This makes comparison of PRS between studies difficult because the genetic effects cannot be disentangled from effects of age and sex (which have a high AUC without the PRS). In this study, we used data from the UK Biobank and applied the stacked clumping and thresholding method and a variation called maximum clumping and thresholding method to develop PRSs to predict coronary artery disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke and type 2 diabetes. We created case-control training datasets in which age and sex were controlled by design. We also excluded prevalent cases to prevent biased estimation of disease risks. The maximum clumping and thresholding PRSs required many fewer single-nucleotide polymorphisms to achieve almost the same discriminatory ability as the stacked clumping and thresholding PRSs. Using the testing datasets, the AUCs for the maximum clumping and thresholding PRSs were 0.599 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.585, 0.613) for atrial fibrillation, 0.572 (95% CI: 0.560, 0.584) for coronary artery disease, 0.585 (95% CI: 0.564, 0.605) for type 2 diabetes, 0.559 (95% CI: 0.550, 0.569) for hypertension and 0.514 (95% CI: 0.494, 0.535) for stroke. By developing a PRS using a dataset in which age and sex are controlled by design, we have obtained true estimates of the discriminatory ability of the PRSs alone rather than estimates that include the effects of age and sex."
https://openalex.org/W4310576429,"Resolving how factors such as temperature, pH, biomolecules and mineral growth rate influence the geochemistry and structure of biogenic CaCO3, is essential to the effective development of palaeoproxies. Here we optimise a method to precipitate the CaCO3 polymorph aragonite from seawater, under tightly controlled conditions that simulate the saturation state (Ω) of coral calcification fluids. We then use the method to explore the influence of aspartic acid (one of the most abundant amino acids in coral skeletons) on aragonite structure and morphology. Using ≥200 mg of aragonite seed (surface area 0.84 m2), to provide a surface for mineral growth, in a 330 mL seawater volume, generates reproducible estimates of precipitation rate over Ωaragonite = 6.9-19.2. However, unseeded precipitations are highly variable in duration and do not provide consistent estimates of precipitation rate. Low concentrations of aspartic acid (1-10 μM) promote aragonite formation, but high concentrations (≥ 1 mM) inhibit precipitation. The Raman spectra of aragonite precipitated in vitro can be separated from the signature of the starting seed by ensuring that at least 60% of the analysed aragonite is precipitated in vitro (equivalent to using a seed of 200 mg and precipitating 300 mg aragonite in vitro). Aspartic acid concentrations ≥ 1mM caused a significant increase in the full width half maxima of the Raman aragonite v1 peak, reflective of increased rotational disorder in the aragonite structure. Changes in the organic content of coral skeletons can drive variations in the FWHM of the Raman aragonite ν1 peak, and if not accounted for, may confuse the interpretation of calcification fluid saturation state from this parameter."
https://openalex.org/W4310576791,"The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate changes in longitudinal parameters after stereotactic radiotherapy for lung cancer and to identify possible pretreatment factors related to radiation-induced lung toxicity and the decline in pulmonary function after radiotherapy.Protocol-specified examinations, including 4-D CT, laboratory tests, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and body composition measurements, were performed before SRT and at 1 month, 4 months and 12 months after stereotactic radiotherapy. Longitudinal differences were tested by using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Correlations were examined by using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r).Sixteen patients were analyzed in this study. During a median follow-up period of 26.6 months, grade 1 and 2 lung toxicity occurred in 11 patients and 1 patient, respectively. The mean Hounsfield units (HU) and standard deviation (SD) of the whole lung, as well as sialylated carbohydrate antigen KL-6 (KL-6) and surfactant protein-D (SP-D), peaked at 4 months after radiotherapy (p = 0.11, p<0.01, p = 0.04 and p<0.01, respectively). At 4 months, lung V20 Gy (%) and V40 Gy (%) were correlated with changes in SP-D, whereas changes in the mean HU of the lung were related to body mass index and lean body mass index (r = 0.54, p = 0.02; r = 0.57, p = 0.01; r = 0.69, p<0.01; and r = 0.69, p<0.01, respectively). The parameters of PFTs gradually declined over time. When regarding the change in PFTs from pretreatment to 12 months, lung V5 Gy (cc) showed significant correlations with diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), DLCO/alveolar volume and the relative change in DLCO (r = -0.72, p<0.01; r = -0.73, p<0.01; and r = -0.63, p = 0.01, respectively).The results indicated that some parameters peaked at 4 months, but PFTs were the lowest at 12 months. Significant correlations between lung V5 Gy (cc) and changes in DLCO and DLCO/alveolar volume were observed."
https://openalex.org/W4310576798,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the success of major non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine orders, has depended upon robust rates of citizens’ adherence to protocols. Thus, it is critical to public health for research to illuminate factors that affect compliance with contagion-mitigating practices. Previous research has examined sociodemographic factors and aspects of psychological distress as correlates of adherence to public health guidelines. The current study expanded this research to investigate the psychosocial process of co-rumination, which has been identified in previous research as a maladaptive type of social interaction that is associated with elevated levels of anxiety and depression. Data were collected from 932 Italian adults during the initial stages of the highly stressful COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. A path model was tested to examine multivariate relationships among sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms of psychological distress (i.e., depression and anxiety), co-rumination via cellphone, and self-reported adherence to COVID-19-related public health restrictions. Results revealed that higher rates of co-rumination via cellphone were associated with lower levels of adherence to public health restrictions. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were differentially related to co-rumination processes and adherence to public health restrictions. Higher levels of depression symptoms were directly associated with poorer adherence to public health restrictions, and this path was mediated through higher levels of co-rumination via cellphone. On the contrary, higher levels of state anxiety were directly associated with greater adherence to public health guidelines. This path was also mediated through co-rumination via cellphone. Higher levels of anxiety were correlated with lower levels of co-rumination, which in turn were correlated with lower levels of adherence. These results suggest fruitful directions for future research examining co-rumination as a maladaptive coping behavior that may be addressed within public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4310529365,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a common skin cancer caused by deregulated hedgehog signaling. BCC is often curable surgically; however, for orbital and periocular BCCs (opBCC), surgical excision may put visual function at risk. Our recent clinical trial highlighted the utility of vismodegib for preserving visual organs in opBCC patients: 67% of patients displayed a complete response histologically. However, further analysis of excision samples uncovered keratin positive, hedgehog active (Gli1 positive), proliferative micro-tumors. Sequencing of pre-treatment tumors revealed resistance conferring mutations present at low frequency. In addition, one patient with a low-frequency SMO W535L mutation recurred two years post study despite no clinical evidence of residual disease. Sequencing of this recurrent tumor revealed an enrichment for the SMO W535L mutation, revealing that vismodegib treatment enriched for resistant cells undetectable by traditional histology. In the age of targeted therapies, linking molecular genetic analysis to prospective clinical trials may be necessary to provide mechanistic understanding of clinical outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W4310529410,"Medication related problem (MRP) is an event occurring, as a result, the medication therapy that actually or potentially interferes with desired health outcomes. Evidences reported that the prevalence of MRPs may result in a high burden of morbidity and decrease patients' quality of life. The problem is more significant among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a decline in kidney function and increase number of medications required to treat kidney disease and its complications. Thus, this study aimed to assess MRPs and its associated factors among patients with chronic kidney disease.Hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 248 adult ambulatory patients with CKD (stage 1-4) at St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College. Data were collected through patient interview and medical chart review from 1st of June to 30th of August 2019. MRPs were identified based on the standard treatment guidelines. Cipolle MRPs classification was used to classify the MRPs and Micromedex® was used as drug interaction checker. Binary logistic regression was utilized to identify the associated factors and p value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.A total of 325 MRPs were identified from 204 (82.3%) study participants giving 1.6 MRPs per participant. One MRP was identified among 114 (55.9%) patients while two MRPs were identified among 64 (31.4%). The most common class of MRPs were need additional drugs 114 (35.1%) followed by non-compliance 54 (16.6%), unnecessary drug therapy 46 (14.2%) and dose too low 46 (14.2%). The two most common reasons for non-compliance were unaffordability of drugs 26(48.1%) and the lack of patient understanding about drug taking instruction 10 (18.5%). The study showed that only occupation (AOR = 5.2, 95% CI: 1.292-21.288, P = 0.020) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor use (AOR = 6.6, 95% CI: 2.202-19.634, P = 0.001) had an association with the occurrence of MRPs.The prevalence of MRPs among ambulatory patients with CKD was high and need of additional drug therapy was the commonest MRPs."
https://openalex.org/W4310529412,"The aim of the study was to determine the impact of internal and external (proximal and distal) attentional focus on table tennis backhand stroke accuracy in low-skilled players. Fifty-one undergraduate physical education (PE) students were randomly assigned to 3 groups: Group G1 (IF) was instructed to focus on the hand holding the paddle, Group G2 (EFP) was instructed to focus on the ball, while Group G3 (EFD) was instructed to focus on targets marked on the tennis table. The experimental groups followed identical instructions except for the instruction about the focus of attention. Participants were asked to score as many points as possible by hitting the ball inside the three smallest targets marked on the tennis table. They were required to do so using a backhand stroke. The practice session consisted of 45 trials in three blocks of backhand (15 trials at each target). A special scoring system was used to determine the accuracy of the strokes. One of the most important findings from the current research was that groups with an external focus of attention revealed significant improvements in accuracy in the post-test, while the group with an internal focus of attention achieved low training effects. No significant difference was observed between G2 (EFP) and G3 (EFD) in the delayed retention test, which indicates that proximal and distal attentional focus had similar effects on table tennis backhand stroke accuracy in low-skilled players."
https://openalex.org/W4310576418,"Kisspeptin modulates GnRH secretion in mammals and peripheral administration of 10-amino acid fragment of kisspeptin (Kp10) induces LH release and ovulation in cattle. Experiments were done to determine if iv administration of kisspeptin will activate GnRH neurons (i.e., after crossing the blood-brain barrier) and if pre-treatment with a GnRH receptor blocker will alter kisspeptin-induced LH release (from gonadotrophs) and ovulation. In Experiment 1, cows (n = 3 per group) were given human-Kisspeptin10 (hKp10; 3 x 15 mg iv at 60-min intervals) or normal saline and euthanized 150 min after treatment was initiated. Every 20 th free-floating section (50 μm thickness) from the preoptic area to hypothalamus was double immunostained to colocalize GnRH- (DAB) and activated neurons (cFOS; Nickel-DAB). Kisspeptin induced plasma LH release from 15 to 150 min (P = 0.01) but the proportion of activated GnRH neurons did not differ between groups (5.8% and 3.5%, respectively; P = 0.11). Immunogold electron microscopy detected close contacts between kisspeptin fibers and GnRH terminals in the median eminence. In Experiment 2, pubertal heifers (n = 5 per group) were treated with 1) hKp10 iv, 2) Cetrorelix (GnRH antagonist; im) + hKp10 iv or 3) saline on Day 6 of the follicular wave under low-progesterone condition. A rise in plasma LH concentration was detected from 15 to 240 min in the hKp10 group but not in cetrorelix or control group (P&lt;0.001). Ovulations were detected only in the hKp10 group (4/5; P = 0.02). Cetrorelix treatment was associated with regression of the preovulatory dominant follicle and emergence of a new follicular wave 3.4±0.75 days after the treatment in all five heifers. Results support the hypothesis that the effect of peripheral kisspeptin is mediated downstream of GnRH synthesis and does not involve GnRH-independent LH release from gonadotrophs. Peripheral kisspeptin may release pre-synthesized GnRH from the nerve terminals in areas outside the blood-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W4310576424,"Emotion reasoning, including labeling of facial expressions, is an important building block for a child's social development. This study investigated age biases in labeling facial expressions in children and adults, focusing on the influence of intensity and expression on age bias. Children (5 to 14 years old; N = 152) and adults (19 to 25 years old; N = 30) labeled happiness, disgust or sadness at five intensity levels (0%; 25%; 50%; 75%; and 100%) in facial images of children and adults. Sensitivity was computed for each of the expression-intensity combinations, separately for the child and adult faces. Results show that children and adults have an age bias at low levels of intensity (25%). In the case of sadness, children have an age bias for all intensities. Thus, the impact of the age of the face seems largest for expressions which might be most difficult to recognise. Moreover, both adults and children label most expressions best in adult rather than child faces, leading to an other-age bias in children and an own-age bias in adults. Overall, these findings reveal that both children and adults exhibit an age bias in labeling subtle facial expressions of emotions."

Given the enormous amount of genetic information, scientists are able to perform mammoth tasks to improve the standard of health care such as determining genetic influences on outcome of allogeneic transplantation. Cloud based computing has increasingly become a key choice for many scientists, engineers and institutions as it offers on-demand network access and users can conveniently rent rather than buy all required computing resources. With the positive advancements of cloud computing and nanopore sequencing data output, we were motivated to develop an automated and scalable analysis pipeline utilizing cloud infrastructure in Microsoft Azure to accelerate HLA genotyping service and improve the efficiency of the workflow at lower cost. In this study, we describe (i) the selection process for suitable virtual machine sizes for computing resources to balance between the best performance versus cost effectiveness; (ii) the building of Docker containers to include all tools in the cloud computational environment; (iii) the comparison of HLA genotype concordance between the in-house manual method and the automated cloud-based pipeline to assess data accuracy. In conclusion, the Microsoft Azure cloud based data analysis pipeline was shown to meet all the key imperatives for performance, cost, usability, simplicity and accuracy. Importantly, the pipeline allows for the on-going maintenance and testing of version changes before implementation. This pipeline is suitable for the data analysis from MinION sequencing platform and could be adopted for other data analysis application processes."
https://openalex.org/W4310576743,"Astaxanthin derived from natural sources occurs in the form of various esters and stereomers, which complicates its quantitative and qualitative analysis. To simplify and standardize astaxanthin measurement with high precision, an enzymolysis-based astaxanthin quantification method was developed to hydrolyze astaxanthin esters and determine free astaxanthin in all its diastereomeric forms. Astaxanthin standards and differently processed Haematococcus pluvialis biomass were investigated. Linear correlation of standards of all- E- astaxanthin was observed in a measurement range between extract concentrations of 1.0 μg/mL and 11.2 μg/mL with a coefficient of variation below 5%. The diastereomers 9 Z- , and 13 Z-astaxanthin , and two di- Z -forms were detected. In contrast to the measurement of standards, the observed measurement range was extended to 30 μg/mL in extracts from H . pluvialis . The nature of the sample had to be taken into account for measurement, as cell, respectively, sample composition altered the optimal concentration for astaxanthin determination. The measurement precision of all- E- astaxanthin quantification in dried H . pluvialis biomass (1.2–1.8 mg dried biomass per sample) was calculated with a coefficient of variation of maximum 1.1%, whereas it was below 10% regarding the diastereomers. Complete enzymolysis was performed with 1.0 to 2.0 units of cholesterol esterase in the presence of various solvents with up to 2.0 mg biomass (dry weight). The method was compared with other astaxanthin determination approaches in which astaxanthin is converted to acetone in a further step before measurement. The developed method resulted in a higher total astaxanthin recovery but lower selectivity of the diastereomers. The reliability of photometric astaxanthin estimations was assessed by comparing them with the developed chromatographic method. At later stages in the cell cycle of H . pluvialis , all methods yielded similar results (down to 0.1% deviation), but photometry lost precision at earlier stages (up to 31.5% deviation). To optimize sample storage, the shelf life of astaxanthin-containing samples was investigated. Temperatures below -20°C, excluding oxygen, and storing intact H . pluvialis cells instead of dried or disrupted biomass reduced astaxanthin degradation."

Using a latent class regression model (N = 407), we examined patterns of online social support seeking and anti-racism advocacy engagements that were associated with online racism among racial/ethnic minority adults. We also examined whether these patterns were associated with ethnic-racial socialization messages (cultural socialization, promotion of mistrust, preparation for racial bias), perceived health, and alcohol use severity. Three distinct latent groups were identified with meaningful group differences: triggered/reactive (alcohol use risk, higher promotion of mistrust), moderate engagement (no risk), disengaged/non-reactive (higher promotion of mistrust, higher cultural socialization, alcohol use risk) groups. Online social support seeking and advocacy engagement may have both benefits and costs in coping with online racism. Those who engage at optimal/balanced levels appear to report better well-being. Implications for research and practice are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4310576788,"This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of post-transportation vitamin E (VE) supplementation on health condition, blood biochemical parameters, blood antioxidant indices and blood metabolomics in yak. Five yaks were used in this study. After 2100 km of highway transportation from Riwoqe county to Rongchang County, Chongqing, blood was collected immediately after arrival and these samples served as the baseline (control, CON_VE). A VE injection (40 mg/kg) was then performed and blood samples were collected 10 days later. Injection of VE led to lower serum VE concentration. Relative to the CON_VE, VE injection led to greater concentrations of creatinine and lower concentrations of glutamate pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, direct bilirubin, UREA and glucose. Compared with CON_VE, VE injection led the lower serum level of malondialdehydeand greater serum level of glutathione s-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase 4. Based on metabolomics analysis, 119 differentially altered serum metabolites (P<0.05 and VIP>1.0) were identified with VE injection relative to CON_VE. VE injection resulted in changes of lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphocholine, choline, malate, citrate, α-Oxo-glutarate, phenylalanine, 3-Phenylpropanoic acid and 3-(3-Hydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid. These metabolites are associated with lipid metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative stress. Overall, our study indicates that VE injection can alleviate transportation stress in yak partly through protecting liver and kidney, and improving antioxidant defense systems."
https://openalex.org/W4311184030,"Yanshan ginger (Alpinia zerumbet) is a perennial herb used as a medicine and spice, and is beneficial for soil and water conservation in karst areas. Given the widespread utilization of Yanshan ginger in China and continuing expansion of the planting area, disposal of waste materials is problematic. The branches and leaves of Yanshan ginger contain a variety of potent antibacterial compounds, such as volatile oils, phenols, and diterpenoids, which hinder their rapid degradation by microorganisms. In this study, we screened and constructed a composite microbial system to provide a technical reference for production of organic fertilizer from the branches and leaves of Yanshan ginger.A composite microbial system, ""YanShan Jun"" (YSJ), was developed by screening for efficient detoxification and degradation of the branches and leaves of Yanshan ginger. High-throughput sequencing technology was used to investigate the stability and diversity of YSJ subcultures. The culture conditions for YSJ were optimized by sequential single-factor experiments and response surface analysis. Yanshan ginger leaves and branches were inoculated with YSJ to study its effects on composting efficiency.The microbial composition of YSJ was stable and rich in diversity through continuous subculture. Through response surface analysis, the optimized culture conditions for YSJ were determined as follows: peptone 8.0 g/L, sodium chloride 9.0 g/L, calcium carbonate 5.2 g/L, yeast powder 1.6 g/L, cultivation temperature 56.1°C, and culture duration 6 d. Under these conditions, the degradation rate of Yanshan ginger was 58.32%, which was 14.22% higher than that before optimization. The ability of YSJ to degrade the antibacterial compounds of ginger after optimization was significantly enhanced. Inoculation of Yanshan ginger compost with YSJ increased the fermentation temperature, prolonged the high-temperature period, and reduced the water content and pH of the compost in the early stage.Inoculation of plant compost with YSJ bacteria improves the nutritional environment of the compost, promotes the composting reaction, promotes the rapid formation of a strong indigenous microflora, forms a beneficial microecological environment, and increases the composting efficiency. This study provides a theoretical basis for practical application of YSJ for organic fertilizer production from Yanshan ginger."
https://openalex.org/W4311190524,"Effector proteins secreted by plant pathogens are essential for infection. Cytoplasmic RXLR effectors from oomycetes are characterized by the presence of RXLR and EER motifs that are frequently linked to WY- and/or LWY-domains, folds that are exclusive to this effector family. A related family of secreted candidate effector proteins, carrying WY-domains and the EER motif but lacking the canonical RXLR motif, has recently been described in oomycetes and is mainly found in downy mildew pathogens. Plasmopara viticola is an obligate biotrophic oomycete causing grapevine downy mildew. Here we describe a conserved Pl . viticola secreted candidate non-RXLR effector protein with cell death-inducing activity in Nicotiana species. A similar RXLR effector candidate from the broad host range oomycete pathogen Phytophthora parasitica also induces cell death in Nicotiana . Through comparative tertiary structure modelling, we reveal that both proteins are predicted to carry WY- and LWY-domains. Our work supports the presence of LWY-domains in non-RXLR effectors and suggests that effector candidates with similar domain architecture may exert similar activities."

Concentrating on top researchers enables us to control for the effects of ability and effort, and focusing on the start of their careers minimizes distortions from reputation feedback. Our results reveal that the most important predictor for early career success is the ranking of an author’s PhD granting institution, followed by his first placement. Our insights suggest that a counterfactual decrease in the Alma mater of a high ability author, who graduated from a top 10 university, by as little as 10 to 20 ranks, reduces his probability of getting a top 5 publication significantly by 13 percentage points. Lowering the ranking of his Alma mater by another 80 ranks decreases his chances of getting a top publication by a factor of three. Our findings suggest that the economics publication market values Alma mater signals, discounting newcomers graduating from- or working at lower ranked departments."

The following study focused on stereotypes and student readiness for interprofessional learning. Patient perceptions were also evaluated. Osteopathic and allopathic students were randomly allocated 1:1:1 to work in pairs (MD/DO, MD/MD, DO/DO) at the start of each shift. A questionnaire evaluating student communication was collected from patients at the end of each encounter. Surveys assessing stereotypes and interprofessional readiness were obtained from students at the end of each workday. Data collection was stopped early due to Coronavirus-related safety measures. In the ITT analysis, there were a total of 126 participants (57 students 69 patients). A per-protocol analysis was performed to account for repeat clinic volunteers. No significant differences were detected between student pairs; however, the sensitivity analysis of the questionnaire assessing interprofessional readiness was 8 points higher in the DO/DO group compared to the MD/MD and MD/DO groups (P = 0.0503). In the content analysis of qualitative responses, the MD/DO group was more likely to respond with themes of enjoyment and less concern about stereotypes than the DO/DO group. The MD/DO group was also less likely to report concerns about differences in expectations, methods, and thinking than the MD/MD group. Early trends from this study suggest that DO students may be better positioned to engage in interprofessional learning than their MD counterparts. Additionally, the findings from our content analysis provide evidence that the collaborative experience improved feelings associated with professional legitimacy and credibility among DO students. Taken in aggregate, this study provides justification for a follow-up investigation, as well as a framework for how such studies could best be executed in the future."

This article analyzes the spatial distribution and the dynamics of sheep herd growth using data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics-IBGE from 1990 to 2020. The sheep herd growth rates and densities were estimated to assess its dynamics. Maps were then drawn up to show the spatial dynamics of these variables. The highest concentration of herds in the last decade (2010) occurred in Pará, Mato Grosso, and Maranhão states. For each decade there were different growth patterns, but for the entire period (1990 to 2020), there was growth in Mato Grosso, Pará, Maranhão, Tocantins, and Amazonas micro-regions states. The highest density of herd (animals per area) was observed in Maranhão. The potential points for development identified in this study may support strategic planning aimed at strengthening the activity in the region."
https://openalex.org/W4310503867,"Background Muscle strain injuries (MSIs) in the hamstrings are among the most prevalent injuries in elite soccer. We aimed to examine the relation between biomechanical maladaptation in eccentric strength and neuromuscular factors separated by their time and frequency domains. Methods 20 elite soccer players with a previous history of unilateral MSI in the M. biceps femoris (BF) long head and 20 without MSI participated. Knee flexion torques, rate of torque development (RTD) and electromyographic signals (EMG) of the BF, the M. semitendinosus (SMT) and knee extensors were obtained during unilateral maximal eccentric knee flexions performed at slow (30°/s) and fast (120°/s) angular speeds. Root mean squares and mean power frequency (MF) was calculated. Results In the group with a history of MSI, reduced maximal eccentric flexion torque (slow eccentrics -8±11, p&lt;0.05; fast eccentrics -18±13 N*m, p&lt;0.05) and RTD (-33±28 N*m/s, p&lt;0.05; -95±47 N*m/s, p&lt;0.05) concomitantly occurred with diminished agonistic myoelectrical activities (-4±5% of MVC, p&lt;0.05; -10±7% of MVC, p&lt;0.05) and MFs (-24±13 Hz, p&lt;0.05; -24±18 Hz, p&lt;0.05) in the BF. Simultaneously, antagonistic myoelectric activity was elevated (+4±3% of MVC, p&lt;0.05; +3±3% of MVC, p&lt;0.05) in MSI affected legs as compared to unaffected legs for both eccentric contractions. Deficits in myoelectrical activity (r 2 = 0.715, p&lt;0.05; r 2 = 0.601, p&lt;0.05) and MF (r 2 = 0.484, p&lt;0.05; r 2 = 0.622, p&lt;0.05) correlated with deficits in maximal torque in the affected leg in the MSI group. Analysis of SMT demonstrated no significant differences. Conclusion Positive relationships between neuromuscular deficits and the reduced eccentric strength profile underpin neuronal inhibition after MSI. This persistent involvement of dysfunctional synergist and antagonist neural hamstring function in strength weakness is of clinical relevance in sports medicine for prevention and rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W4310503874,"Background This study characterized undernutrition among children (0–24 months) by age groups specified for Infant and Young Child-feeding (IYCF) and determined the association between child malnutrition and IYCF. Methods This cross-sectional survey recruited mother-children dyads (N = 1443). WHO standards were used to assess nutritional status and IYCF indicators. Multivariate analyses were performed to assess the association between IYCF and nutritional indicators. Results Stunting, underweight, wasting, overweight, and obesity were prevalent in 33.1%, 26%, 20.2%, 4.6%, and 2.9% of the children, respectively. Age-wise distribution of undernutrition identified severity of stunting and underweight at 10–24 months (median &lt; -1.6 SD; &lt; -1.2 SD; 25th percentile at -2.6 &amp; -2.2 SD respectively) and wasting highest at 0–6 months (25 th percentile close to -2SD). Boys manifested higher stunting (lower value -5.2 SD) and were more wasted (lower value -4.7 SD). IYCF prevalence recorded early initiation at 45.2%, exclusive breastfeeding at 23.1%, and prelacteal and bottle-feeding at 37.5 and 22.5% respectively. Child minimum diet diversity (MDD) ≥4 was not achieved by 84%. Minimum meal frequency and minimum acceptable diet were achieved by 75% and 14% respectively. Bottle-feeding increased the odds of wasting [AOR: 1.501 (95% CI: 1.062–2.121)], severe stunting [AOR: 1.595 (95% CI: 1.079–2.358)] and underweight [AOR: 1.519 (95% CI 1.102–2.094)]. Wasting according to BAZ scores was associated with delayed initiation of breastfeeding [AOR: 1.387 (95% CI: 1.018–1.889)] and bottle feeding [AOR: 1.538 (95% CI: 1.087–2.175)]. Delayed introduction of complementary feeding increased the odds of severe stunting [AOR: 2.189 (95% CI: 1.090–4.399)]. Formula feeding increased the odds of underweight [AOR: 1.738 (95% CI: 1.046–2.888)] and obesity [AOR: 4.664 (95% CI: 1.351–16.10)]. Prelacteal feeding increased the odds of severe forms of stunting and underweight by 56% and 79% respectively, and overweight by 96%. Conclusion Setting and age-specific interventions to improve age-appropriate child-feeding practices are vital to address the double burden of malnutrition in the critical age group."
https://openalex.org/W4310504341,"The ability of any incident reporting system to improve patient care is dependent upon robust reporting practices. However, under-reporting is still a problem worldwide. We aimed to reveal the barriers experienced while reporting an incident through a nationwide survey in Japan. We conducted a cross-sectional survey. All first- and second-year residents who took the General Medicine In-Training Examination (GM-ITE) from February to March 2021 in Japan were selected for the study. The voluntary questionnaire asked participants regarding the number of safety incidents encountered and reported within the previous year and the barriers to reporting incidents. Demographics were obtained from the GM-ITE. The answers of respondents who indicated they had never previously reported an incident (non-reporting group) were compared to those of respondents who had reported at least one incident in the previous year (reporting group). Of 5810 respondents, the vast majority indicated they had encountered at least one safety incident in the past year (n = 4449, 76.5%). However, only 2724 (46.9%) had submitted an incident report. Under-reporting (more safety incidents compared to the number of reports) was evident in 1523 (26.2%) respondents. The most frequently mentioned barrier to reporting an incident was the time required to file the report (n = 2622, 45.1%). The barriers to incident reporting were significantly different between resident physicians who had previously reported and those who had never previously reported an incident. Our study revealed that resident physicians in Japan commonly encounter patient safety incidents but under-report them. Numerous perceived and experienced barriers to reporting remain, which should be addressed if incident reporting systems are to have an optimal impact on improving patient safety. Incident reporting is essential for improving patient safety in an institution, and this study recommends establishing appropriate interventions according to each learner's barriers for reporting."
https://openalex.org/W4310506139,"Selection of high-quality embryos is important to achieve successful pregnancy in assisted reproductive technology (ART). Recently, it has been debated whether RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) should be applied to ART to predict embryo quality. However, information on genes that can serve as markers for pregnant expectancy is limited. Furthermore, there is no information on which transcriptome of trophectoderm (TE) or inner cell mass (ICM) is more highly correlated with pregnant expectancy. Here, we performed RNA-Seq analysis of TE and ICM of human blastocysts, the pregnancy expectation of which was retrospectively determined using the clinical outcomes of 1,890 cases of frozen-thawed blastocyst transfer. We identified genes that were correlated with the expected pregnancy rate in ICM and TE, respectively, with a larger number of genes identified in TE than in ICM. Downregulated genes in the TE of blastocysts that were estimated to have lower expectation of pregnancy included tight junction-related genes such as CXADR and ATP1B1 , which have been implicated in peri-implantation development. Moreover, we identified dozens of differentially expressed genes by regrouping the blastocysts based on the maternal age and the Gardner score. Additionally, we showed that aneuploidy estimation using RNA-Seq datasets does not correlate with pregnancy expectation. Thus, our study provides an expanded list of candidate genes for the prediction of pregnancy in human blastocyst embryos."

Eighty-seven percent of the samples were nasopharyngeal samples, and 23% of the samples were oral, nasal and oral pharyngeal swabs. We conducted bioinformatics analyses to examine differences in microbial populations of these samples, as a proxy for the nasal and oral microbiome, from SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative specimens. We found 91% concordance with the LLMDA relative to a diagnostic RT-qPCR assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Sixteen percent of all the samples (32/203) revealed the presence of an opportunistic bacterial or frank viral pathogen with the potential to cause co-infections. The two most detected bacteria, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, were present in both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative samples. Human metapneumovirus was the most prevalent viral pathogen in the SARS-CoV-2 negative samples.

We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using both focus group discussions and individual interviews with research fellows, and individual interviews with their mentors. We recruited all eligible participants by email. We collected data in person and analyzed it thematically. We followed the consolidated criteria for reporting of qualitative research (COREQ) checklist. A total of 17 research fellows and 17 mentors participated in the study. Participants described the current non-formal program and proposed suggestions for a formal training program. The identification of available vacant positions and the recruitment process followed an unstructured approach, through networking with mentors and previous fellows. Although there is a formal contract, there is no job description, and no definition of roles, responsibilities and rights. Some fellows get the opportunity of being involved in all aspects of research and benefit from a favorable mentor-mentee relationship. Conversely, others struggle with authorship and with the projects allocated to them, some being “non-research” related. Not all fellows end up publishing their projects. Participants provided suggestions to shift into a formal training, including measures to improve on the recruitment process of fellows, defining roles and exposure to all aspects of research. Research fellows are eager to learn, but the currently available program is unstructured.

https://openalex.org/W4310529366,"Objective Inter-day reliability of sweat measurements, including the absorbent patch and modified iodine-paper techniques, at rest and exercise were evaluated. We further evaluated the effect of iodine paper size and the method of establishing sweat gland activation (sweat gland counting or surface area covered) on reliability. Furthermore, the relationships between all measurement techniques and metabolic heat production [Ḣ prod ] and evaporative requirement for heat balance [Ė req ] were determined. Method Twelve participants were assessed for whole-body sweat loss (WBSL), local sweat rate (LSR; absorbent patch) and sweat gland activation (SGA; iodine-paper) during rest and sub-maximal cycling at ~200, ~250 and ~300 W/m 2 Ḣ prod in the heat. Variations in iodine paper (1 x 1 cm-9 x 9 cm) were used to quantify SGA by counting sweat glands or surface area covered. The ‘optimal’ area of SGA was also determined based on the highest density of recruited glands. Results All measures of the sweating response were positively related with Ḣ prod and Ė req ( r = 0.53–0.84), with the 9 x 9 cm and 6 x 6 cm iodine paper sizes being the strongest ( r = 0.66–0.84) for SGA. Superior inter-day reliability was found for all measures during exercise (CV% = 6–33.2) compared to rest (CV% = 33.5–77.9). The iodine-paper technique was most reliable at 9 x 9 cm (CV% = 15.9) or when the 1 x 1 cm (CV% = 17.6) and 3 x 3 cm (CV% = 15.5) optimal SGA was determined, particularly when measuring the sweat gland number. Significance WBSL, LSR and SGA measurement techniques are sufficiently reliable to detect changes in thermal sweating typically reported. We recommend 9 x 9 cm paper sizes or 1 x 1 cm-3 x 3 cm optimal areas, using either gland counting or surface area to determine SGA."
https://openalex.org/W4310529416,"Introduction Maternal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in pregnancy may result in vertical transmission of CMV to the child. Long-term effects of congenital CMV infection include visual, cognitive as well as neurological impairment. The aim of this study was to estimate the odds ratios for CMV seropositivity and seroconversion in mothers, with and without delayed language development in 3 year old children, nested within a large cohort. Material and methods The Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) is a prospective population-based pregnancy cohort that includes 95 200 mothers and 114 500 children. Blood samples were obtained from mothers during pregnancy weeks 17 or 18 in pregnancy and after birth. We included 300 women from MoBa with children suffering from delayed language development at three years of age, based on validated questionnaires. Within the cohort, 1350 randomly selected women were included as controls to perform a nested case-control study. The cases and controls were tested for CMV IgG antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Among mothers of cases, 63.2% were CMV-IgG positive in the sample at birth, as compared to 55.9% among controls; OR 1.36, (95% CI; 1.05 to 1.76). Also, among case mothers, 8/118 (6.8%) initially seronegative cases, seroconverted. Among initially seronegative controls, seroconversion occurred in 23/618 (3.7%) mothers. The OR for seroconversion in cases as compared to control mothers was 1.88 (CI; 0.82 to 4.31), thus not statistically significant different. Conclusion This study shows a higher risk of delayed language development at three years of age in children born by mothers seropositive for CMV, compared to children born from seronegative mothers."
https://openalex.org/W4310576482,"Emotional styles concern the ways in which individuals adapt and respond to the world and can be defined using six dimensions: outlook, resilience, social intuition, self-awareness, sensitivity to context and attention. The Emotional Style Questionnaire (ESQ) assesses how people vary across the dimensions and gauges an individual’s overall level of emotional health. An Italian version of the ESQ (ESQ-ITA) could favour the understanding of cultural characteristics concerning emotions and personality within the Italian population, with both clinical and social implications. The aim of the present study is to validate the ESQ in the Italian language and to assess its psychometric properties. Two studies were conducted. Study 1 examined construct validity, internal consistency, and test–retest reliability, through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Cronbach’s alpha estimates, and by estimating the Spearman’s rank correlation Study 2 examined construct validity and internal consistency through the CFA and Cronbach’s alpha estimates and investigated criterion validity by correlating the ESQ-ITA dimensions with the corresponding scales or subscales used for the validation estimating, again, the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient Study 2 also examined the criterion validity of the validated scales and the ESQ-ITA overall score to assess its suitability as an indicator of emotional health. ESQ-ITA was confirmed to be reliable and stable. The correlation between the ESQ-ITA overall score and the other scales and questionnaires supports the use of ESQ-ITA to measure emotional health. The Italian version of the ESQ opens up the possibility to enrich the research landscape with new knowledge that will be useful for advancing the pathogenetic and therapeutic aspects of psychological distress and emotional dysregulation."

Providing data in this area is important for planning health policies.A community-based cross-sectional study was done in Woreta town from April-May 2020 with a sample size of 424. A systematic random sampling technique was employed to achieve the required sample size. A pre-tested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data were entered using epi-data version 3.1, then processed and analyzed via SPSS version 20. Descriptive and analytical statistics were employed to summarize the data. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance.A total of 401 individuals aged over 18 years participated, with a response rate of 94.5%. Of those who responded, 56.6% were males. Of all the participants, 36.9% were illiterate. The proportion of people with poor knowledge of strabismus was 45.1%. It was shown that 53.9% of the respondents had a favorable attitude. Older age, higher educational level, having a history of eye examination, and a having a family history of strabismus were significantly associated with good knowledge of strabismus. A higher educational level, older age, and hearing about strabismus were significantly associated with a favorable attitude toward strabismus.The proportion of good knowledge and favorable attitude towards strabismus were lower than previously reported in Gondar City, Northwest Ethiopia.

https://openalex.org/W4310576790,"Tree planting programs now need to consider climate change increasingly, therefore, the resistance to pests plays an essential role in enabling tree adaptation to new ranges through tree population movement. The weevil Pissodes strobi (Peck) is a major pest of spruces and substantially reduces lumber quality. We revisited a large Interior spruce provenance/progeny trial (2,964 genotypes, 42 families) of varying susceptibility, established in British Columbia. We employed multivariate mixed linear models to estimate covariances between, and genetic control of, juvenile height growth and resistance traits. We performed linear regressions and ordinal logistic regressions to test for impact of parental origin on growth and susceptibility to the pest, respectively. A significant environmental component affected the correlations between resistance and height, with outcomes dependent on families. Parents sourced from above 950 m a.s.l. elevation negatively influenced host resistance to attacks, probably due to higher P. engelmannii proportion. For the genetic contribution of parents sourced from above 1,200 m a.s.l., however, we found less attack severity, probably due to a marked mismatch in phenologies. This clearly highlights that interspecific hybrid status might be a good predictor for weevil attacks and delineates the boundaries of successful spruce population movement. Families resulting from crossing susceptible parents generally showed fast-growing trees were the most affected by weevil attacks. Such results indicate that interspecific ‘hybrids’ with a higher P. glauca ancestry might be genetically better equipped with an optimized resource allocation between defence and growth and might provide the solution for concurrent improvement in resistance against weevil attacks, whilst maintaining tree productivity."
https://openalex.org/W4310578838,"We propose a quantitative framework for understanding the knapping force requirements imposed by different raw materials in their unheated and heat-treated states. Our model interprets stone tool knapping as being the result of cracks formed during the first impact with a hammer stone, followed by continued stressing of these cracks that eventually leads to flake detachment. We combine bending strength, indentation fracture resistance and “Griffith” crack lengths of flint and silcrete to obtain functions identifying critical forces for flaking without or after heat treatment. We argue that these forces are a key factor for understanding the “knappability” of different raw materials, because only forces with 100N or less can be used for very precise strike control. Our model explains for the first time why experimental knappers frequently observe that flint (a stronger material, which, in our case, has a strength above 100 MPa) is easier to knap than silcretes (which is relatively weaker with strength values at or below 60 MPa). Our findings allow for understanding the differences between heat-treated and untreated flint and silcrete in terms of knapping quality, and they allow to compare the qualities of different raw materials."

The Rod and Disc Test (RDT) was used to create an optokinetic surround around a centrally located rod. Participants aligned the rod to their subjective visual vertical (SVV) in both static and dynamic disc conditions. VD was calculated as the difference in SVV between these two conditions. Results There was no group difference or gender difference in static or dynamic SVV as well as VD. There was no correlation between VD and any of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores, however VD was significantly correlated to illness duration in the patient group. Conclusions Schizophrenia is not associated with greater VD levels at a perceptual level, compared to controls, indicating adequate visuo-vestibular integration for judging line verticality in these patients. Patients with greater chronicity of the disease are more visually dependent than those less chronically ill, consistent with previous reports of possible vestibular dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia. This may affect their daily functioning in dynamic visual environments."

We obtained 151 data (race time: 13.65 ± 0.33 s, range of race time: 12.91 s- 14.47 s) from several previous studies. Regression equations were developed to predict each touchdown time (times from the start signal to the instants of the leading leg landing after clearing 1st to 10th hurdles) from the race time. To avoid overtraining for each regression equation, data were split into training and testing data sets in accordance with a leave-one-out cross-validation. From the results of cross-validation, the agreement and generalization were compared between the present study model and the existing model. As a result, the proposed predictive equations showed a good agreement and generalization (R2 = 0.527-0.981, MSE = 0.0015-0.0028, MAE = 0.019-0.033) compared to that of existing equations (R2 = 0.481-0.979, MSE = 0.0017-0.0039, MAE = 0.034-0.063). Therefore, it can be assumed that the proposed predictive equations are a more robust, reliable model than the existing model. The touchdown times needed for coaches and elite hurdlers to set their target records will be accurately understood using the model of this study. Therefore, this study model would help to improve training interventions and race evaluations."

Invasion of alien plants is a severe threat to biodiversity and ecosystem worldwide. A pot experiment was conducted by using three stoloniferous alien plants Wedelia trilobata, Alternanther philoxeroides and Hydrocotyle vulgaris to investigate effects of nutrient supply on their leaf stoichiometry and relative growth rate. Different nitrogen or phosphorus supply was applied in the experiment (N1:1 mmol L-1, N2:4 mmol L-1, and N3:8 mmol L-1, P1:0.15 mmol L-1, P2:0.6 mmol L-1 and P3:1.2 mmol L-1). Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in leaves of the three alien plants significantly increased with increase of nitrogen supply. With increase of phosphorus supply, nitrogen or phosphorus concentration of leaf was complex among the three alien plants. N:P ratio in leaf of the three alien plants subjected to different levels of nutrient supply was various. A positive correlation between relative growth rate and N:P ratio of the leaf is observed in W. trilobata and A. philoxeroides suffering from N-limitation. A similar pattern was not observed in Hydrocotyle vulgaris. We tentatively concluded that correlations between relative growth rate and N: P ratio of the leaf could be affected by species as well as nutrient supply. It is suggested that human activities, invasive history, local abundance of species et al maybe play an important role in the invasion of alien plants as well as relative growth rate."
https://openalex.org/W4311184155,"P -nitrophenol (PNP) is a carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic compound that can cause serious harm to the environment. A strain of Pseudomonas putida DLL-E4, can efficiently degrade PNP in a complex process that is influenced by many factors. Previous studies showed that the expression level of pnpA , a key gene involved in PNP degradation, was upregulated significantly and the degradation of PNP was obviously accelerated in the presence of glucose. In addition, the expression of crc , crcY , and crcZ , key genes involved in catabolite repression, was downregulated, upregulated, and upregulated, respectively. To investigate the effect of the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) system on PNP degradation, the crc , crcY , and crcZ genes were successfully knocked out by conjugation experiments. Our results showed that the knockout of crc accelerated PNP degradation but slowed down the cell growth. However, the knockout of crcY or crcZ alone accelerated PNP degradation when PNP as the sole carbon source, but that knockout slowed down PNP degradation when glucose was added. The results indicate that the CCR system is involved in the regulation of PNP degradation, and further work is required to determine the details of the specific regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4311190522,"With the rapid development of the international community, foreign language learning has become increasingly important. Listening training is a particularly important component of foreign language learning. The most difficult aspect of listening training is the development of speech discrimination ability, which is crucial to speech perception. General behavioral training requires a substantial amount of time and attention. To address this, we previously developed a neurofeedback (NF) training system that enables unconscious learning of auditory discrimination. However, to our knowledge, no studies have compared NF training and general behavioral training. In the present study, we compared the learning effects of NF training, general behavioral training, and a combination of both strategies. Specifically, we developed a gamified and adapted NF training of auditory discrimination. We found that both NF training and general behavioral training enhanced behavioral performance, whereas only NF training elicited significant changes in brain activity. Furthermore, the participants that used both training methods exhibited the largest improvement in behavioral performance. This indicates that the combined use of NF and general behavioral training methods may be optimal for enhancing auditory discrimination ability when learning foreign languages."

The objectives of this study were: (1) to estimate the incidence of FM at the national and state levels in Mexico in 2020; (2) to estimate the incidence of FM stratified by maternal and newborn characteristics; (3) to identify the states with the highest risk of FM; (4) to georeference the incidence of FM. Open data from the Birth Information Subsystem were used. Relative risks were estimated by adjusted Poisson regression models. The national incidence of FM was 2.75%. The entity with the lowest incidence was Mexico City (1.28%) and the most affected states were Sonora (6.20%), Baja California Sur (5.44%), and Sinaloa (5.36%), located in the north of the country. The incidence of FM at the national level is below that reported in the international literature. The results of this study can be used for the design and implementation of programs, public policies, and interventions."
