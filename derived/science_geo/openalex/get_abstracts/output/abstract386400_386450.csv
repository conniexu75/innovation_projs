https://openalex.org/W2009592273,"Reciprocity of inflammation, oxidative stress and neovascularization is emerging as an important mechanism underlying numerous processes from tissue healing and remodelling to cancer progression. Whereas the mechanism of hypoxia-driven angiogenesis is well understood, the link between inflammation-induced oxidation and de novo blood vessel growth remains obscure. Here we show that the end products of lipid oxidation, ω-(2-carboxyethyl)pyrrole (CEP) and other related pyrroles, are generated during inflammation and wound healing and accumulate at high levels in ageing tissues in mice and in highly vascularized tumours in both murine and human melanoma. The molecular patterns of carboxyalkylpyrroles are recognized by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), but not TLR4 or scavenger receptors on endothelial cells, leading to an angiogenic response that is independent of vascular endothelial growth factor. CEP promoted angiogenesis in hindlimb ischaemia and wound healing models through MyD88-dependent TLR2 signalling. Neutralization of endogenous carboxyalkylpyrroles impaired wound healing and tissue revascularization and diminished tumour angiogenesis. Both TLR2 and MyD88 are required for CEP-induced stimulation of Rac1 and endothelial migration. Taken together, these findings establish a new function of TLR2 as a sensor of oxidation-associated molecular patterns, providing a key link connecting inflammation, oxidative stress, innate immunity and angiogenesis."

Analyses of lipid molecular species by dynamic quantitative mass spectrometry and concomitant transcriptomic measurements define the lipidome and demonstrate immediate responses in fatty acid metabolism represented by increases in eicosanoid synthesis and delayed responses characterized by sphingolipid and sterol biosynthesis. Lipid remodeling of glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and prenols also take place, indicating that activation of the innate immune system by inflammatory mediators leads to alterations in a majority of mammalian lipid categories, including unanticipated effects of a statin drug. Our studies provide a systems-level view of lipid metabolism and reveal significant connections between lipid and cell signaling and biochemical pathways that contribute to innate immune responses and to pharmacological perturbations."

We now describe a more potent mechanism by which TSP1 inhibits VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) activation through engaging its receptor CD47. CD47 ligation is known to inhibit downstream signaling targets of VEGFR2, including endothelial nitric-oxide synthase and soluble guanylate cyclase, but direct effects on VEGFR2 have not been examined. Based on FRET and co-immunoprecipitation, CD47 constitutively associated with VEGFR2. Ligation of CD47 by TSP1 abolished resonance energy transfer with VEGFR2 and inhibited phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and its downstream target Akt without inhibiting VEGF binding to VEGFR2. The inhibitory activity of TSP1 in large vessel and microvascular endothelial cells was replicated by a recombinant domain of the protein containing its CD47-binding site and by a CD47-binding peptide derived from this domain but not by the CD36-binding domain of TSP1. Inhibition of VEGFR2 phosphorylation was lost when CD47 expression was suppressed in human endothelial cells and in murine CD47-null cells. These results reveal that anti-angiogenic signaling through CD47 is highly redundant and extends beyond inhibition of nitric oxide signaling to global inhibition of VEGFR2 signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2134758295,"The acquired capability of tumor cells to migrate and invade neighboring tissues is associated with high metastatic potential and advanced stage of cancers. Recently, signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) have been implicated in the aggressive behavior of cancer cells. However, the roles of specific ROS in cancer cell migration and Cav-1 regulation are unclear. We demonstrate here that Cav-1 plays an important role in the migration and invasion of human lung carcinoma H460 cells and that these effects are differentially regulated by cellular ROS. Using various known inhibitors and donors of ROS, we found that different ROS have different effects on Cav-1 expression and cell migration and invasion. Superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide down-regulated Cav-1 expression and inhibited cell migration and invasion, whereas hydroxyl radical up-regulated the Cav-1 expression and promoted cell migration and invasion. The down-regulating effect of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide on Cav-1 is mediated through a transcription-independent mechanism that involves protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These results indicate the essential role of different ROS in cancer cell motility and through Cav-1 expression, which may provide a key mechanism controlling tumor progression and metastasis. The up-regulation of Cav-1 and cell motility by hydroxyl free radical suggests an important role of this ROS as a positive regulator of tumor progression."

Using a cell line in which deletion of the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT; the enzyme that adds O-GlcNAc) can be induced by 4-hydroxytamoxifen, we screened the expression of 84 HSPs using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. In OGT null cells the stress-induced expression of 18 molecular chaperones, including HSP72, were reduced. GSK-3β promotes apoptosis through numerous pathways, including phosphorylation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) at Ser303 (Ser(P)303 HSF1), which inactivates HSF1 and inhibits HSP expression. In OGT null cells we observed increased Ser(P)303 HSF1; conversely, in cells in which O-GlcNAc levels had been elevated, reduced Ser(P)303 HSF1 was detected. These data, combined with those showing that inhibition of GSK-3β in OGT null cells recovers HSP72 expression, suggests that O-GlcNAc regulates the activity of GSK-3β. In OGT null cells, stress-induced inactivation of GSK-3β by phosphorylation at Ser9 was ablated providing a molecular basis for these findings. Together, these data suggest that stress-induced GlcNAcylation increases HSP expression through inhibition of GSK-3β.

O-GlcNAc is thought to regulate protein function in a manner analogous to protein phosphorylation (1Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Interestingly, in some models of cellular injury, for example, ischemia reperfusion injury and trauma hemorrhage, the levels of O-GlcNAc decrease (45Champattanachai V. Marchase R.B. Chatham J.C. Am.

Modulating O-GlcNAc appears to impact several pathways in a manner consistent with increased survival. These include: 1) improving protein solubility in models of heat stress (25Cheung W.D. Hart G.W.

HSP72 belongs to a large family of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones, expressed constitutively or inducibly in most subcellular compartments (38Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Nollen E.A. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 64Daugaard M. Rohde M. Jäättelä M.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 11-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HSPs act to prevent cell death via numerous mechanisms, including: 1) refolding proteins; 2) preventing protein aggregation; 3) altering transcription; and 4) inhibiting apoptotic signaling pathways (38Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Nollen E.A. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 64Daugaard M. Rohde M. Jäättelä M.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 11-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the nine HSP70s in mammalian cells, the predominant stress-induced nuclear and cytosolic HSP70 is the result of transcription from two genes: Hsp70.1a and Hsp70.1b (64Daugaard M. Rohde M. Jäättelä M. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The products of these genes are 98% identical and are often referred to collectively as HSP72, which also delineates them from other HSP70 family members (64Daugaard M. Rohde M. Jäättelä M. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). HSP72 is a key regulator of cell survival and deletion of HSP72 genes renders cells sensitive to environmental and physiological stress (67Oh K.H. Kim J.Y. Kim D. Lee E.M. Oh H.Y. Seo J.S. Han J.S.

HSP72 expression is predominantly regulated at the level of transcription, which is mediated by the transcription factor, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) (71Voellmy R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2004; 9: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 72Holmberg C.I. Tran S.E. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). HSF1 is regulated at numerous points; in unstressed cells HSF1 is maintained as an inert monomer in a complex with HSP90 and other proteins in the cytoplasm. Upon stress, HSF1 disassociates from the HSP90, exposing a trimerization and nuclear localization domain. Once in the nucleus, HSF1 can bind DNA but is not fully active until phosphorylated at over 10 sites (71Voellmy R.

Phosphorylation by GSK-3β at Ser303 maintains HSF1 in an inactive state in unstressed cells, and is involved in deactivation of HSF1 post-stress promoting reduced DNA binding, nuclear export, and cytoplasmic sequestration by 14-3-3ϵ (73Xavier I.J.

Recently, it has been reported that HSF1 is acetylated and that this appears to peak post-stress enhancing HSF1 deactivation (77Westerheide S.D. Anckar J. Stevens Jr., S.M. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Science. 2009; 323: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that O-GlcNAc appears to regulate the expression of HSP72 and HSP40 (37Zachara N.E. O'Donnell N. Cheung W.D. Mercer J.J. Marth J.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30133-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To confirm these data and to determine whether O-GlcNAc regulates the expression of other molecular chaperones we have performed an RT-PCR array directed against 84 molecular chaperones. We have shown that O-GlcNAc appears to regulate the expression of at least 18 chaperones, including HSP72. To determine the mechanism(s) by which this occurs we have focused on the mechanism by which O-GlcNAc regulates the expression of HSP72. Two other groups have suggested that O-GlcNAc regulates HSP72 expression by either: 1) stabilizing the housekeeping transcription factor Sp1 to elevated temperatures, thus leading to enhanced HSP72 expression (60Lim K.H. Chang H.I. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); or 2) by modulating the localization of HSF1 (78Singleton K.D. Wischmeyer P.E. JPEN J. Parenter. Enteral. Nutr. 2008; 32: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, in this study we present an alternative model in which O-GlcNAc regulates HSP expression by modulating the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3β. As GSK-3β promotes apoptosis through numerous pathways (79Kannoji A. Phukan S. Sudher Babu V. Balaji V.N. Expert Opin. Ther.

We show here that the converse also holds true: the conformational state of the estrogen receptor can direct distinct orientations of the bound ligand. 'Gain-of-allostery' mutations that mimic the effects of ligand in driving protein conformation allowed crystallization of the partial agonist ligand WAY-169916 with both the canonical active and inactive conformations of the estrogen receptor. The intermediate transcriptional activity induced by WAY-169916 is associated with the ligand binding differently to the active and inactive conformations of the receptor. Analyses of a series of chemical derivatives demonstrated that altering the ensemble of ligand binding orientations changes signaling output. The coupling of different ligand binding orientations to distinct active and inactive protein conformations defines a new mechanism for titrating allosteric signaling activity."
https://openalex.org/W2020730385,"Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to produce the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). We demonstrate here that the SK1 inhibitor, SKi (2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole) induces the proteasomal degradation of SK1 in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells, MCF-7 and MCF-7 HER2 breast cancer cells and that this is likely mediated by ceramide as a consequence of catalytic inhibition of SK1 by SKi. Moreover, SK1 is polyubiquitinated under basal conditions, and SKi appears to increase the degradation of SK1 by activating the proteasome. In addition, the proteasomal degradation of SK1a and SK1b in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells is associated with the induction of apoptosis. However, SK1b in LNCaP-AI cells (androgen-independent) is less sensitive to SKi-induced proteasomal degradation and these cells are resistant to SKi-induced apoptosis, thereby implicating the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of SK1 as an important mechanism controlling cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2031476529,"We biochemically simulated HIV-1 DNA polymerization in physiological nucleotide pools found in two HIV-1 target cell types: terminally differentiated/non-dividing macrophages and activated/dividing CD4(+) T cells. Quantitative tandem mass spectrometry shows that macrophages harbor 22-320-fold lower dNTP concentrations and a greater disparity between ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP) and dNTP concentrations than dividing target cells. A biochemical simulation of HIV-1 reverse transcription revealed that rNTPs are efficiently incorporated into DNA in the macrophage but not in the T cell environment. This implies that HIV-1 incorporates rNTPs during viral replication in macrophages and also predicts that rNTP chain terminators lacking a 3'-OH should inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcription in macrophages. Indeed, 3'-deoxyadenosine inhibits HIV-1 proviral DNA synthesis in human macrophages more efficiently than in CD4(+) T cells. This study reveals that the biochemical landscape of HIV-1 replication in macrophages is unique and that ribonucleoside chain terminators may be a new class of anti-HIV-1 agents specifically targeting viral macrophage infection."
https://openalex.org/W2124018854,"Compelling evidence shows a strong correlation between accumulation of neurotoxic β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides and oxidative stress in the brains of patients afflicted with Alzheimer disease (AD). One hypothesis for this correlation involves the direct and harmful interaction of aggregated Aβ peptides with enzymes responsible for maintaining normal, cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Identification of specific, destructive interactions of Aβ peptides with cellular anti-oxidant enzymes would represent an important step toward understanding the pathogenicity of Aβ peptides in AD. This report demonstrates that exposure of human neuroblastoma cells to cytotoxic preparations of aggregated Aβ peptides results in significant intracellular co-localization of Aβ with catalase, an anti-oxidant enzyme responsible for catalyzing the degradation of the ROS intermediate hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). These catalase-Aβ interactions deactivate catalase, resulting in increased cellular levels of H(2)O(2). Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors of catalase-amyloid interactions protect the hydrogen peroxide-degrading activity of catalase in Aβ-rich environments, leading to reduction of the co-localization of catalase and Aβ in cells, inhibition of Aβ-induced increases in cellular levels of H(2)O(2), and reduction of the toxicity of Aβ peptides. These studies, thus, provide evidence for the important role of intracellular catalase-amyloid interactions in Aβ-induced oxidative stress and propose a novel molecular strategy to inhibit such harmful interactions in AD."

CTD binding requires a positively charged crevice in the C-terminal SH2 subdomain, which lacks the canonical phospho-binding pocket of SH2 domains and had previously escaped detection.

Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4935-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that is required for transcription elongation together with Spt4 and Spt5 (3.Swanson M.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1992; 132: 325-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Spt6 co-localizes with Spt5 on transcribed genes in Drosophila polytene chromosomes (5.Andrulis E.D. Guzmán E. Döring P. Werner J. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2635-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 6.Kaplan C.D. Morris J.R. Wu C. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2623-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Spt6 stimulates the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II in vivo (7.Ardehali M.B. Yao J. Adelman K. Fuda N.J. Petesch S.J. Webb W.W. Lis J.T. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence that Spt6 is a histone chaperone. In cells lacking functional Spt6, transcription can start from cryptic promoters within the coding regions of genes (8.Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and transcription reinitiation from regular promoters is facilitated (9.Adkins M.W. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This suggests that Spt6 is required for the correct positioning of nucleosomes in transcribed regions. Consistently, Spt6 interacts with histone H3 and can deposit nucleosomes on DNA (10.Bortvin A. Winston F. Science. 1996; 272: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Spt6 is further involved in mRNA 3′-end formation (11.Kaplan C.D. Holland M.J. Winston F. J. Biol.

Cho H. Pickle L. Evans R.M. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The Spt6 C-terminal region was predicted to contain an SH2 domain. We recently reported the crystal structure of this SH2 domain (13.Dengl S. Mayer A. Sun M. Cramer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which is the only SH2 domain in the yeast genome (14.Maclennan A.J. Shaw G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 464-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The structure contained residues 1251–1349 of Candida glabrata Spt6 and showed a fold that combined features of both SH2 domain subfamilies present in higher eukaryotes (15.Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar, 16.Pawson T. Gish G.D. Nash P. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 504-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), likely resembling a common evolutionary ancestor of all SH2 domains (13.Dengl S. Mayer A. Sun M. Cramer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The structure also revealed a shallow phospho-binding pocket that explained the unusual binding specificity for phospho-serine rather than phospho-tyrosine. Our previous work, however, also showed that the SH2 domain alone did not bind CTD phospho-peptides (13.Dengl S. Mayer A. Sun M. Cramer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), although a more extended C-terminal region does (12.Yoh S.M. Cho H. Pickle L. Evans R.M. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).To resolve this discrepancy, we investigated the structure and CTD binding of C-terminal fragments of Spt6 encompassing the SH2 domain and additional flanking regions. We found that a second SH2 domain is present directly C-terminal of the known SH2 domain. X-ray crystallography revealed that the two SH2 domains form an extended interface and are arranged in a previously unobserved manner into a rigid “tandem SH2 domain.” In contrast to the previously studied single SH2 domain, the tandem SH2 domain binds Ser-2-phosphorylated CTD peptides in vitro. The tandem SH2 domain is apparently also required for transcription elongation in vivo as shown by 6-azauracil (6-AU) phenotyping. Our results reveal a novel CTD-binding protein module and indicate that the structure and CTD binding function of the Spt6 C-terminal region is conserved in eukaryotes.DISCUSSIONHere we report that the C-terminal region of the essential transcription elongation factor Spt6 contains a tandem SH2 domain that combines the previously described SH2 domain (subdomain SH2-N) with a second, subsequent SH2 domain (subdomain SH2-C) into a single domain of novel structure. We show that the tandem SH2 domain, in contrast to SH2-N alone, binds to Ser-2-phosphorylated CTD peptides in vitro. A single phosphorylated Ser-2 residue is required and sufficient for binding, but the presence of a second phosphorylated Ser-2 residue strongly enhances binding, consistent with published data (34.Liu P. Kenney J.M. Stiller J.W. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2010; 27: 2628-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35.Stiller J.W. Cook M.S. Eukaryotic Cell. 2004; 3: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36.Liu P. Greenleaf A.L. Stiller J.W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2008; 25: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The tandem domain is also required for cell growth in the presence of the nucleotide-depleting drug 6-AU in vivo, indicating its importance for transcription elongation.We further show that the tandem SH2 domain of Spt6 is unique in its structure and mode of CTD binding. Two adjacent SH2 domains are found in several proteins in higher eukaryotes but are arranged in a different way in known three-dimensional structures (Fig. 2). Also, the tandem domain contains a canonical phospho-binding pocket only in its subdomain SH2-N, but not in its subdomain SH2-C, which lacks the invariant arginine residue found in all other SH2 domains.Consistent with observed structural differences, the Spt6 tandem SH2 domain has a unique phospho-peptide binding mode. Two surface patches are involved in CTD binding, the canonical phospho-binding pocket in subdomain SH2-N and a non-canonical basic crevice in subdomain SH2-C that comprises an invariant lysine residue that contributes to binding. Mutating either one of these two conserved basic residues on the two CTD-binding surface patches resulted in a weaker interaction. It is likely that the SH2-C crevice interacts with a phospho-serine residue because a CTD peptide with a single phosphorylated Ser-2 residue binds equally well to wild-type tandem SH2 domain and a variant in which the SH2-N pocket is mutated. These results are consistent with an extended peptide-binding surface that reaches from the SH2-N pocket to the SH2-C crevice. Structural features that may provide specificity for CTD binding are, however, difficult to identify in the absence of a complex crystal structure.Canonical SH2 domains bind phosphorylated target peptides via two pockets, one that recognizes the phosphorylated tyrosine side chain (pocket 1) and one that contacts residues C-terminal of the phospho-tyrosine (pocket 2), generally at register +3. Pocket 2 generally contributes to the specificity of the interaction. In Spt6 SH2-N, pocket 1 is present and used for peptide binding, but the previously described pocket 2, which was proposed to play a similar role as in other SH2 domains (13.Dengl S. Mayer A. Sun M. Cramer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), is occluded in the tandem SH2 domain structure (Fig. 3B). In SH2-C, neither pocket 1 nor pocket 2 is observed, but instead a conserved crevice on the opposite face contributes to peptide binding.Despite all these differences between the Spt6 tandem SH2 domain and other arrangements of two SH2 domains, there is a functional analogy. Consistent with our observations, individual ZAP-70 SH2 domains do not bind the target phospho-peptide but do so when in a tandem arrangement (37.Wange R.L. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More generally, the phospho-peptide binding specificity of single SH2 domains is increased by the simultaneous binding of the peptide to an additional domain (38.Machida K. Mayer B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1747: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Tandem SH2 domains therefore may generally increase target specificity due to cooperative peptide binding as suggested (39.Ottinger E.A. Botfield M.C. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 729-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Recent data indicate that the tandem SH2 domain is required for retaining Spt6 at the end of transcribed genes, rather than recruiting it to genes. We have recently shown by high resolution genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation that Spt6 is recruited during an early transition in the 5′-region of genes near the transcription start site before high levels of Ser-2 phosphorylation are reached (40.Mayer A. Lidschreiber M. Siebert M. Leike K. Söding J. Cramer P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Deletion of the genomic region encoding the tandem SH2 domain lowered the level of recruitment, in particular at the 3′-region around the polyadenylation site, where levels of Ser-2 phosphorylation are high (40.Mayer A. Lidschreiber M. Siebert M. Leike K. Söding J. Cramer P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These results indicated that Spt6 is recruited near the transcription start site with the use of a CTD Ser-2 phosphorylation-independent mechanism in vivo, but full recruitment and retaining of Spt6 at the polyadenylation site require the CTD-binding tandem SH2 domain.

Spt6 stimulates the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II in vivo (7.Ardehali M.B. Yao J. Adelman K. Fuda N.J. Petesch S.J. Webb W.W. Lis J.T. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence that Spt6 is a histone chaperone. In cells lacking functional Spt6, transcription can start from cryptic promoters within the coding regions of genes (8.Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and transcription reinitiation from regular promoters is facilitated (9.Adkins M.W. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This suggests that Spt6 is required for the correct positioning of nucleosomes in transcribed regions.

The structure also revealed a shallow phospho-binding pocket that explained the unusual binding specificity for phospho-serine rather than phospho-tyrosine. Our previous work, however, also showed that the SH2 domain alone did not bind CTD phospho-peptides (13.Dengl S. Mayer A. Sun M. Cramer P. J. Mol.

We found that a second SH2 domain is present directly C-terminal of the known SH2 domain.

DISCUSSIONHere we report that the C-terminal region of the essential transcription elongation factor Spt6 contains a tandem SH2 domain that combines the previously described SH2 domain (subdomain SH2-N) with a second, subsequent SH2 domain (subdomain SH2-C) into a single domain of novel structure. We show that the tandem SH2 domain, in contrast to SH2-N alone, binds to Ser-2-phosphorylated CTD peptides in vitro. A single phosphorylated Ser-2 residue is required and sufficient for binding, but the presence of a second phosphorylated Ser-2 residue strongly enhances binding, consistent with published data (34.Liu P. Kenney J.M. Stiller J.W. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2010; 27: 2628-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35.Stiller J.W. Cook M.S. Eukaryotic Cell. 2004; 3: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36.Liu P. Greenleaf A.L. Stiller J.W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2008; 25: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The tandem domain is also required for cell growth in the presence of the nucleotide-depleting drug 6-AU in vivo, indicating its importance for transcription elongation.We further show that the tandem SH2 domain of Spt6 is unique in its structure and mode of CTD binding. Two adjacent SH2 domains are found in several proteins in higher eukaryotes but are arranged in a different way in known three-dimensional structures (Fig. 2). Also, the tandem domain contains a canonical phospho-binding pocket only in its subdomain SH2-N, but not in its subdomain SH2-C, which lacks the invariant arginine residue found in all other SH2 domains.Consistent with observed structural differences, the Spt6 tandem SH2 domain has a unique phospho-peptide binding mode. Two surface patches are involved in CTD binding, the canonical phospho-binding pocket in subdomain SH2-N and a non-canonical basic crevice in subdomain SH2-C that comprises an invariant lysine residue that contributes to binding. Mutating either one of these two conserved basic residues on the two CTD-binding surface patches resulted in a weaker interaction. It is likely that the SH2-C crevice interacts with a phospho-serine residue because a CTD peptide with a single phosphorylated Ser-2 residue binds equally well to wild-type tandem SH2 domain and a variant in which the SH2-N pocket is mutated. These results are consistent with an extended peptide-binding surface that reaches from the SH2-N pocket to the SH2-C crevice. Structural features that may provide specificity for CTD binding are, however, difficult to identify in the absence of a complex crystal structure.Canonical SH2 domains bind phosphorylated target peptides via two pockets, one that recognizes the phosphorylated tyrosine side chain (pocket 1) and one that contacts residues C-terminal of the phospho-tyrosine (pocket 2), generally at register +3. Pocket 2 generally contributes to the specificity of the interaction. In Spt6 SH2-N, pocket 1 is present and used for peptide binding, but the previously described pocket 2, which was proposed to play a similar role as in other SH2 domains (13.Dengl S. Mayer A. Sun M. Cramer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), is occluded in the tandem SH2 domain structure (Fig. 3B). In SH2-C, neither pocket 1 nor pocket 2 is observed, but instead a conserved crevice on the opposite face contributes to peptide binding.Despite all these differences between the Spt6 tandem SH2 domain and other arrangements of two SH2 domains, there is a functional analogy. Consistent with our observations, individual ZAP-70 SH2 domains do not bind the target phospho-peptide but do so when in a tandem arrangement (37.Wange R.L. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More generally, the phospho-peptide binding specificity of single SH2 domains is increased by the simultaneous binding of the peptide to an additional domain (38.Machida K. Mayer B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1747: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2092617531,"Ca2+ influx by store-operated Ca2+ channels is a key component of the receptor-evoked Ca2+ signal. In all cells examined, transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels mediate a significant portion of the receptor-stimulated Ca2+ influx. Recent studies have revealed how STIM1 activates TRPC1 in response to store depletion; however, the role of STIM1 in TRPC channel activation by receptor stimulation is not fully understood. Here, we established mutants of TRPC channels that could not be activated by STIM1 but were activated by the “charge-swap” mutant STIM1(K684E,K685E). Significantly, WT but not mutant TRPC channels were inhibited by scavenging STIM1 with Orai1(R91W), indicating the STIM1 dependence and independence of WT and mutant TRPC channels, respectively. Importantly, mutant TRPC channels were robustly activated by receptor stimulation. Moreover, STIM1 and STIM1(K684E,K685E) reciprocally affected receptor-activated WT and mutant TRPC channels. Together, these findings indicate that TRPC channels can function as STIM1-dependent and STIM1-independent channels, which increases the versatility of TRPC channel function and their role in receptor-stimulated Ca2+ influx.

https://openalex.org/W1983172492,"DNA glycosylases that remove alkylated and deaminated purine nucleobases are essential DNA repair enzymes that protect the genome, and at the same time confound cancer alkylation therapy, by excising cytotoxic N3-methyladenine bases formed by DNA-targeting anticancer compounds. The basis for glycosylase specificity towards N3- and N7-alkylpurines is believed to result from intrinsic instability of the modified bases and not from direct enzyme functional group chemistry. Here we present crystal structures of the recently discovered Bacillus cereus AlkD glycosylase in complex with DNAs containing alkylated, mismatched and abasic nucleotides. Unlike other glycosylases, AlkD captures the extrahelical lesion in a solvent-exposed orientation, providing an illustration for how hydrolysis of N3- and N7-alkylated bases may be facilitated by increased lifetime out of the DNA helix. The structures and supporting biochemical analysis of base flipping and catalysis reveal how the HEAT repeats of AlkD distort the DNA backbone to detect non-Watson-Crick base pairs without duplex intercalation."
https://openalex.org/W1982057613,"The short chain fatty acid (SCFA) buyrate is a product of colonic fermentation of dietary fibers. It is the main source of energy for normal colonocytes, but cannot be metabolized by most tumor cells. Butyrate also functions as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor to control cell proliferation and apoptosis. In consequence, butyrate and its derived drugs are used in cancer therapy. Here we show that aggressive tumor cells that retain the capacity of metabolizing butyrate are positively selected in their microenvironment. In the mouse xenograft model, butyrate-preselected human colon cancer cells gave rise to subcutaneous tumors that grew faster and were more angiogenic than those derived from untreated cells. Similarly, butyrate-preselected cells demonstrated a significant increase in rates of homing to the lung after intravenous injection. Our data showed that butyrate regulates the expression of VEGF and its receptor KDR at the transcriptional level potentially through FoxM1, resulting in the generation of a functional VEGF:KDR autocrine growth loop. Cells selected by chronic exposure to butyrate express higher levels of MMP2, MMP9, α2 and α3 integrins, and lower levels of E-cadherin, a marker for epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The orthotopic model of colon cancer showed that cells preselected by butyrate are able to colonize the animals locally and at distant organs, whereas control cells can only generate a local tumor in the cecum. Together our data shows that a butyrate-rich microenvironment may select for tumor cells that are able to metabolize butyrate, which are also phenotypically more aggressive.

The anti-tumor effects of butyrate were described in studies using colorectal cancer cell lines, in which butyrate inhibits growth, and induces differentiation and apoptosis (7Heerdt B.G. Houston M.A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3288-3293PubMed Google Scholar). In other studies butyrate was able to inhibit tumor growth in vivo in murine models (8Mariadason J.M. Velcich A.

Despite these findings, there is an unresolved paradox concerning the putative protective role of butyrate in colon cancer, colorectal cancers still develop and grow despite the high concentrations of butyrate in the colon. Furthermore, several studies have now shown that butyrate-resistant cells may be selected and give rise to more aggressive cancers (8Mariadason J.M. Velcich A. Wilson A.J. Augenlicht L.H. Gibson P.R.

Here, we demonstrate that chronic exposure of colon cancer cells to butyrate may result in the selection of more aggressive clones. Our data provides evidence showing that butyrate-resistant colon cancer cells acquire the ability to metabolize butyrate, resembling normal colonocytes. In butyrate-preselected cells we also found genes involved in EMT, cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis, and metastasis to be up-regulated compared with the unselected cells. Human colon cancer cell lines (HCT15-CCL-225 and SW480-CCL-228, ATCC) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen 41965 with glucose 4.5 g/liter and l-glutamine) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For butyric acid chronic exposure, cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1 mm butyric acid (Sigma) for 5 days. For metabolic assays using NMR, cells grew in DMEM with 1 mm [U-13C]butyrate sodium salt (Sigma). For assaying if butyrate is directly incorporated into membranes or first transformed to acetate, HCT15 cells were grown in a total butyrate concentration of 1 mm: 20% [U-13C]butyrate and 80% butyric acid. For 13C NMR analysis of ethanol extracts HCT15 cells were grown overnight in DMEM with 10 mm [U-13C]butyrate sodium salt (Sigma). Control and butyrate-preselected HCT15 cells were collected and the lipidic fractions were extracted with 15 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl 12 m (2:1:0.01, v/v/v) and 3.8 ml of KCl (66 mm). After centrifugation, the organic phase was evaporated under nitrogen, and lipids were suspended in chloroform d (deuterium) for NMR analysis. For analysis of the intracellular content, the cells were extracted with ice-cold ethanol (80%) and the supernatants were freeze-dried and suspended in D2O for NMR analyses. Proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra of cellular extracts were acquired in a Bruker AVANCE III 500 (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) at 125.77 MHz, using a 5-mm 13C selective probe head. Proton decoupling was applied during the acquisition time only. Spectra were recorded at a temperature of 300 K. The chemical shifts in aqueous sample were referred to (trimethylsilyl) propanesulfonic acid, whereas the samples in chloroform d (deuterium) were referred to the solvent signal designated at 77.0 ppm. Assignments were made by comparison with chemical shifts found in the literature for metabolic intermediates. The 13C/13C-correlation spectrum (COSY) was acquired with a standard Bruker Pulse sequence using a 13C 90° flip angle under continuous 1H decoupling. The amount of glucose in culture supernatants was determined by using D_Glucose UV-method (Roche Applied Science/R-Biopharm). Xenografted subcutaneous tumors were induced by inoculation of 5 × 106 HCT15 cells, butyric acid preselected and controls, into the subcutaneous region of 6-week-old male Balb/SCID mice. Animals were sacrificed at day 20. For the VEGF-KDR autocrine loop assay, the animals were injected intra-peritoneally every 3 days with 500 ng of IMC-11C1 (ImClone Systems, New York) or PBS. Tumors were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and embedded in gelatin. The antibodies used were anti-CD31 and anti-phospho-Histone3 (Table 1). Secondary antibodies were, respectively, anti-rat and rabbit FITC/phycoerythrin-coupled IgG (Alexa Fluor 488/594, Molecular Probes). Cells were examined in microscopy (Axioplan Microscope, Zeiss, Germany). Microvessel density was evaluated through CD31 immunoreactivity of the five most vascular areas (×200 field). Proliferation was evaluated through phospho-Histone3 immunoreactivity of the five most proliferative areas (×200 field).TABLE 1Primary antibodies used in immunofluorescense and Western blottingAntigenAntibodyDilutionCommercialTechniqueaIF, immunofluorescense; IH, immunohistochemistry; WB, Western blotting.α2 Integrin6110161:50BD BiosciencesIFα3 Integrinsc-70191:50Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.IFα5 Integrinsc-13541:50Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.IFα6 Integrin13781:50ChemiconIFαV Integrin99691:50Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.IFβ3 Integrinsc-200581:50Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.IFKDRV30031:25SigmaIFCytochrome oxidase-2sc-652391:50Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.IFE-Cadherin4A2C71:50ZymedIFCK-19RCK1081:100DakoCytomationIHFoxO1C29H41:50Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.IFFoxM1263C2a1:50Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.IFCD315533701:100BD PharmigenIFpH306–5701:100Cell Signaling SolutionsIFSCADABVAP696Y1:1000AbnovaWBMCAD100–11211:1000Novus BiologicalsWBβ-ActinA54411:1000SigmaWBa IF, immunofluorescense; IH, immunohistochemistry; WB, Western blotting.

Cell extracts were performed with RIPA buffer + 1 mm Na2VO3 + 1× proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), on ice for 30 min. Mitochondria extracts were performed according to the Mitochondria Isolation Kit (MITOISO1, Sigma). Primary antibodies used are shown in Table 1. Secondary antibodies were conjugated with HRP (horseradish peroxidase) and reactivity was developed using ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were quantified using Image J software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Media supernatants of HCT15 cells treated with 1 mm butyric acid were loaded in a 12% polyacrylamide gel (30% acryamide/bis solution, 29:1 (3.3% C), Bio-Rad) with 0.1% gelatin and electrophoresis was performed in 1× TGS buffer (Bio-Rad) during 6 h at 150 V. The gel was incubated in renaturating buffer (25% Triton X-100, v/v) in agitation at room temperature, after which the gel was incubated overnight at 37 °C in developing buffer (50 mm Tris base, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij 35). Staining was performed with 0.5% (w/v) Coomassie Blue R-250 for 30 min and destaining with methanol/acetic acid/water (50:10:40). Bands were quantified using ImageJ software. HCT15 cells (1 × 105) were seeded in the upper well ( 5 μm) in 100 μl of DMEM, 10% FBS and in the lower well in 500 μl of DMEM, 10% FBS, cells were added in the presence or absence of EGF (20 ng/μl) and/or 1 mm butyric acid. Each condition was performed in triplicate and after 12 h the number of cells in the lower well was counted. Expression of VEGF was measured in medium from cultures of HCT15 control cells and HCT15 cells were treated with 1 mm butyric acid, using VEGF ELISA kit Human (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA extraction (RNeasy mini kit, Qiagen), RT-PCR, and mRNA arrays (Oligo GEArray, SuperArray Bioscience corporation) were performed following standard protocols.

Data were analyzed using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test or the Tukeys test one-way analysis of variance. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Under the culture conditions defined under “Experimental Procedures” (in the presence of 1 mm butyrate, for up to 5 days), the HCT15 colon cell line thrives and shows growth patterns similar to untreated cells, whereas SW480 grew much slower when exposed to butyrate (supplemental Fig. 1A) and the levels of cell death were 2-fold higher in the SW480 cell line compared with HCT15 after 5 days of exposure to butyrate (supplemental Fig. 1B). Therefore, we used these culture conditions to study the effects of butyrate in metabolic profiling and the acquisition of phenotypic changes by HCT15 cells. The 13C NMR spectra of lipid extracts of butyrate-treated HCT15 cells showed no substantial alterations in lipid contents, compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1A). The major difference observed was an intensity increase of the resonances in the spectral region characteristic of the olephinic carbons (127 to 131 ppm), indicating an increase in lipid unsaturation. In the 13C NMR spectra of HCT15 cells treated with [U-13C]butyrate extracts, it was possible to observe the incorporation of the labeled carbons from [U-13C]butyrate in the lipid fraction (Fig. 1A). The peaks assigned to ω-1 (14 ppm), ω-2 (22 ppm), ω-3 (32 ppm), C1 (174 ppm), C2 (34 ppm), C3 (24–25 ppm), and the elongation carbons (27–30 ppm) of long chain fatty acids indicated the existence of carbons originating from the [U-13C]butyrate and from other sources. The incorporation of labeled carbons in glycerol was not detected (data not shown), indicating that in triacylglycerol molecules, carbons from butyrate were only incorporated in the fatty acid chain. For the SW480 cell line, there was no alteration in the spectra from the lipidic fraction with and without [U-13C]butyrate, suggesting that butyrate is not metabolized by these cells. In the 13C-13C COSY spectra of lipid extracts from HCT15 cells grown in 20% [U-13C]butyrate and 80% of butyric acid, each signal shows a single COSY correlation, i.e. ω-2 correlated only with ω-1 and not with ω-3, which in turn presented a correlation with an elongation carbon (Fig. 1C), meaning that carbon is incorporated in two atom blocks. Hence, 13C-13C COSY spectra showed that butyrate enters in β-oxidation and is catabolized to acetate prior to incorporation into fatty acids. The 13C NMR spectra of ethanol extracts of HCT15 cells treated overnight with 10 mm [U-13C]butyrate showed that the labeled carbons were incorporated in position 5 of proline and in position 4 of glutamate (Fig. 1B). The J13C-13C coupling constant present in carbon 4 of glutamate indicated that carbon 5 is also labeled. These results suggest that carbons from butyrate enter the oxidative pathway of the Kreb's cycle as acetyl-CoA, being converted to glutamate through oxaloacetate. These data are in agreement with increased expression of SCAD and MCAD (Fig. 2A), acyldehydrogenases that can catalyze the first step of butyrate β-oxidation. Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that the SCAD and MCAD promoters were activated in HCT15 cells previously exposed to butyrate (Fig. 2B). We also found that butyrate-preselected cells express more resistin (RETN) (Fig. 3), which is a hormone that represses the uptake of glucose. This indicates that like normal colonocytes, these cells preferred to metabolize butyrate rather than glucose. Taken together, these data showed that at least a subset of HCT15 cells can fully metabolize butyrate.FIGURE 3HCT15 cells preselected with butyrate express more FoxM1 and membrane and metastases-associated proteins. SuperArray analysis for cell membrane and metastasis markers revealed that HCT15 cells preselected with butyric acid express higher levels of genes related to inhibition of glucose uptake, low differentiation, cell cycle and proliferation, and a more invasive (metastatic) behavior. These data were obtained from three independent experiments, with consistent results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RQ-PCR showed decreased mRNA expression of glucose transporters GLUT1 and SGLT1, whereas MCT1 was increased in the butyrate-preselected HCT15 cells, indicating that HCT15 cells uptake butyrate rather than glucose, because MCT1 is a transporter for butyrate (Fig. 2C). Despite the fact that HEXII is not the unique hexokinase encoding gene, its decreased expression is in agreement with the lower rates of glucose uptake observed in HCT15 cells cultured in butyrate-supplemented medium, which is about 20% less than control cells (Fig. 2D). The expression of PKLR was increased, indicative of glycolysis. The decreased expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase indicates that the pentose-phosphate pathway was partially affected by the lack of glucose, however, the increased expression of PEPCK indicates that gluconeogenesis was activated (Fig. 2C). In SW480, the expression of GLUT1 was slightly increased in butyrate-preselected cells, whereas SGLT1 was expressed at the same levels as in control cells. MCT1 expression was also increased in SW480 butyrate-preselected cells, indicating the uptake of butyrate. The expression levels of HEXII, PKLR, and PEPCK were similar expression levels in SW480 control and butyrate-preselected cells, whereas glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is up-regulated in butyrate-preselected cells. In addition, butyrate-preselected cells formed mitochondria aggregates in their cytoplasm, whereas the mitochondria were dispersed in the controls as well as the SW480 control and butyrate-exposed cells (Fig. 2E). Having shown that HCT15 butyrate-preselected cells fully metabolize butyrate, we reasoned that these cells might exhibit different cell phenotypes and behavior in vivo and in vitro compared with control HCT15 cells. Accordingly, butyrate pre-treatment of HCT15 cells prior to subcutaneous inoculation into Balb/SCID mice generated tumors that were significantly more aggressive than those established from control cells. In particular, the tumor sizes (Fig. 4A) and proliferation rates (Fig. 4B) of butyrate-preselected tumors were significantly higher than those established from control cells. Moreover, the microvessel density of butyrate-preselected tumors was also increased (Fig. 4C). In addition to the significant effects in primary tumor growth, butyrate treatment also promoted the formation of lung homing spots. Butyrate-preselected HCT15 cells formed a significant number of lung metastases shortly after inoculation, whereas control cells formed significantly fewer metastases (Fig. 4D). In both groups of animals the liver demonstrated no alterations or metastasis (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that butyrate-preselected cells have increased tumorigenic and metastatic potential. These cancer cells were also implanted orthotopically into the cecal wall. Sixty days after implantation, mice injected with control HCT15 cells showed gross lesions only in the cecum, whereas those injected with butyrate-preselected HCT15 cells showed gross lesions in the peritoneum, liver, pancreas, kidney, lung, and mediastinum (Fig. 5A). Histological examination showed that tumors derived from the control HCT15 cells were multifocal to diffuse, with severe infiltration of the muscle layer, submucosa, and lamina propria. The tumor patterns were mainly nested, with areas of solid growth and moderate lymphatic invasion (Fig. 5B). Primary tumors from butyrate-preselected HCT15 cells were multifocal, with much smaller foci confined to the submucosa. These tumors were rarely detected in the muscle layer, with no infiltration of the lamina propria; but lymphatic invasion was severe for these tumors (Fig. 5B). Notably, metastasis to the liver and lung occurred through vascular dissemination but not by diffusion/infiltration from the serosal surfaces, as observed in the spleen, kidney, and pancreas (Fig. 5C). Next, we explored the molecular basis for the phenotypic features seen in tumors from butyrate-preselected HCT15 cells. First, as determined by zymography, butyrate-preselected HCT15 cells secreted significantly higher levels of active MMP9 and MMP2 (Fig. 6A) compared with control cells, suggestive of increased invasive behavior. Moreover, butyrate-preselected HCT15 cells showed increased migratory capacity to EGF gradient (Fig. 6B), and increased VEGF production into the culture supernatants (Fig. 7A), consistent with the increased angiogenesis seen in vivo (Fig. 4C), and the increased KDR expression (Fig. 7B).FIGURE 7HCT15 cells preselected with butyrate have a more angiogenic phenotype. A, as determined by ELISA, butyrate-preselected HCT15 cells express more VEGF than control cells (p = 0.03); B, as determined by immunofluorescence, butyrate-preselected HCT15 cells express more KDR than control cells. These data were obtained from three independent experiments, with consistent results; C, luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the VEGF promoter sequence −131 to −1 is significantly more active (p < 0.02) than the other tested sequences in HCT15 cells, and deletion constructs pVEGF1, pVEGF2, and pVEGF4 are significantly stimulated in cells preselected by butyric acid (p = 0.041 for pVEGF1, p = 0.0073 for pVEGF2 and p = 0.0098 for pVEGF4); D, luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the KDR promoter sequence −446 to −1 is significantly more active (p = 0.046) than the sequence −796 to −1 in HCT15 cells, and both deletion constructs of KDR promoter are significantly stimulated in cells preselected by butyric acid (p = 0.0205 for pKDR1 and p = 0.0477 for pKDR2; E, as shown by immunofluorescence, butyrate-preselected HCT15 cells show low levels of FoxO1 and increased expression of FoxM1 transcription factor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We exploited further the regulation of VEGF and KDR expression in butyrate-preselected HCT15 cells. As shown using luciferase reporter gene assays, both VEGF and KDR promoters exhibited higher activities in butyrate-preselected cells (Fig. 7, C and D). The regulatory elements responsible for the induction of promoter activity in the butyrate-preselected cells appeared to locate between −131 and −66 upstream of the ATG translational start site, whereas for the KDR promoter the responsive region was mapped between −446 and the ATG. We next analyzed the involvement of the forkhead Fox transcription factors (previously shown to regulate VEGF expression (12Wang Z. Banerjee S. Kong D. Li Y. Sarkar F.H.

As shown in Fig. 7E, there were no detectable differences in FoxO1 expression between the control and butyrate-preselected cells, whereas FoxM1 expression was increased in the butyrate-preselected cells compared with the controls. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that butyrate-preselected cells have higher levels of activated VEGF and KDR, and this induction is mediated at the transcriptional level; in the case of VEGF, it may involve the transcription factor FoxM1 (14Zhang Y.

Altered insulin signaling for hepatic gluconeogenesis and muscle glucose uptake is thought to play a central role. Development under suboptimal conditions is also known to increase the risk of insulin resistance in adulthood. However, the partial contributions of reduced oxygen vs. nutrient delivery to the fetus, two common adverse conditions in utero, to developmental programming of insulin resistance remain unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of developmental hypoxia or undernutrition on the expression of insulin-signaling proteins in liver and skeletal muscle in adult rat offspring. We show that the expression of hepatic phospho-Akt and muscle Akt2 were significantly reduced in offspring of hypoxic, relative to offspring from normoxic or undernourished, pregnancies. Hepatic Akt-1, Akt-2, and PKCζ protein expression was reduced in offspring from both hypoxic and undernourished pregnancies. Muscle GLUT4 expression was decreased in undernourished, and further decreased in hypoxic, offspring. These findings link prenatal hypoxia to down-regulation of components of hepatic and muscle Akt expression in adult offspring. Akt may represent a pharmaceutical target for clinical intervention against the developmental programming of metabolic disease resulting from prenatal hypoxia.—Camm, E. J., Martin-Gronert, M.

https://openalex.org/W2008884889,"The A2A and A2B adenosine receptors (A2AR and A2BR) are implicated in many physiological processes. However, the mechanisms of their intracellular maturation and trafficking are poorly understood. In comparative studies of A2AR versus A2BR expression in transfected cells, we noticed that the levels of cell surface expression of A2BR were significantly lower than those of A2AR. A large portion of the A2BR was degraded by the proteasome. Studies of cell surface expression of A2BR chimeric molecules in transfectants suggested that A2BR does not have the dominant forward transport signal for export from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. A2BR surface expression was increased in A2BR chimeras where the A2BR carboxyl terminus (CT) was replaced or fused with the A2AR CT. Co-transfection of A2AR with A2BR enhanced surface expression of A2BR though the F(X)(6)LL motif in the A2AR CT. The requirements of A2AR expression for better A2BR cell surface expression was not only established in transfectants but also confirmed by observations of much lower levels of A2BR-induced intracellular cAMP accumulation in response to A2BR-activating ligand in splenocytes from A2AR(-/-) mice than in wild type mice. The results of mechanistic studies suggested that poor A2BR expression at the cell surface might be accounted for mainly by the lack of a dominant forward transport signal from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane; it is likely that A2BR forms a hetero-oligomer complex for better function."
https://openalex.org/W2164945425,"MST1 (mammalian STE20-like kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that is cleaved and activated by caspases during apoptosis. Overexpression of MST1 induces apoptotic morphological changes such as chromatin condensation, but the mechanism is not clear. Here we show that MST1 induces apoptotic chromatin condensation through its phosphorylation of histone H2AX at Ser-139. During etoposide-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, the cleavage of MST1 directly corresponded with strong H2AX phosphorylation. In vitro kinase assay results showed that MST1 strongly phosphorylates histone H2AX. Western blot and kinase assay results with a mutant S139A H2AX confirmed that MST1 phosphorylates H2AX at Ser-139. Direct binding of MST1 and H2AX can be detected when co-expressed in HEK293 cells and was also confirmed by an endogenous immunoprecipitation study. When overexpressed in HeLa cells, both the MST1 full-length protein and the MST1 kinase domain (MST1-NT), but not the kinase-negative mutant (MST1-NT-KN), could induce obvious endogenous histone H2AX phosphorylation. The caspase-3 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-DEVD-fmk) attenuates phosphorylation of H2AX by MST1 but cannot inhibit MST1-NT-induced histone H2AX phosphorylation, indicating that cleaved MST1 is responsible for H2AX phosphorylation during apoptosis. Histone H2AX phosphorylation and DNA fragmentation were suppressed in MST1 knockdown Jurkat cells after etoposide treatment. Taken together, our data indicated that H2AX is a substrate of MST1, which functions to induce apoptotic chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation."

https://openalex.org/W2127337265,"AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1 (AUF1) binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-untranslated regions of mRNAs encoding many cytokines and other regulatory proteins modulates mRNA stability, thereby influencing protein expression. AUF1-mRNA association is a dynamic paradigm directed by various cellular signals, but many features of its function remain poorly described. There are four isoforms of AUF1 that result from alternative splicing of exons 2 and 7 from a common pre-mRNA. Preliminary evidence suggests that the different isoforms have varied functional characteristics, but no detailed quantitative analysis of the properties of each isoform has been reported despite their differential expression and regulation. Using purified recombinant forms of each AUF1 protein variant, we used chemical cross-linking and gel filtration chromatography to show that each exists as a dimer in solution. We then defined the association mechanisms of each AUF1 isoform for ARE-containing RNA substrates and quantified relevant binding affinities using electrophoretic mobility shift and fluorescence anisotropy assays. Although all AUF1 isoforms generated oligomeric complexes on ARE substrates by sequential dimer association, sequences encoded by exon 2 inhibited RNA-binding affinity. By contrast, the exon 7-encoded domain enhanced RNA-dependent protein oligomerization, even permitting cooperative RNA-binding activity in some contexts. Finally, fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assays showed that the different AUF1 isoforms remodel bound RNA substrates into divergent structures as a function of protein:RNA stoichiometry. Together, these data describe isoform-specific characteristics among AUF1 ribonucleoprotein complexes, which likely constitute a mechanistic basis for differential functions and regulation among members of this protein family."
https://openalex.org/W2003844796,"Src homology 2 (SH2) domains are mostly found in multicellular organisms where they recognize phosphotyrosine-containing signaling proteins. Spt6, a conserved transcription factor and putative histone chaperone, contains a C-terminal SH2 domain conserved from yeast to human. In mammals, this SH2 domain recognizes phosphoserines rather than phosphotyrosines and is essential for the recruitment of Spt6 by elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), enabling Spt6 to participate in the coupling of transcription elongation, chromatin modulation, and mRNA export. We have determined the structure of the entire Spt6 C-terminal region from Antonospora locustae, revealing the presence of two highly conserved tandem SH2 domains rather than a single SH2 domain. Although the first SH2 domain has a canonical organization, the second SH2 domain is highly noncanonical and appears to be unique in the SH2 family. However, both SH2 domains have phosphate-binding determinants. Our biochemical and genetic data demonstrate that the complete tandem, but not the individual SH2 domains, are necessary and sufficient for the interaction of Spt6 with RNAPII and are important for Spt6 function in vivo. Furthermore, our data suggest that binding of RNAPII to the Spt6 tandem SH2 is more extensive than the mere recognition of a doubly phosphorylated C-terminal domain peptide by the tandem SH2. Taken together, our results show that Spt6 interaction with RNAPII via a novel arrangement of canonical and noncanonical SH2 domains is crucial for Spt6 function in vivo."

To date, more than 10 different TLR members have been identified that each recognizes a specific set of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by microorganisms (1Akira S. Takeda K.

Interestingly, emerging data indicate that TLRs function as receptors not only for PAMPs, but also for endogenous molecules released from damaged tissue or cells. For example, TLR2 and -4 recognize various endogenous molecules including heat shock proteins, hyaluronan, and high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) (3Termeer C. Benedix F. Sleeman J. Fieber C. Voith U.

It is possible that TLR recognition of these endogenous molecules is involved in the inflammatory response during “sterile” tissue damage.In the central nervous system (CNS), TLRs including TLR2, -3, and -4 are expressed in microglia and astrocytes, suggesting a role as innate immune cells in the CNS (8Kielian T.

Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 81: 163-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). NMDA and AMPA/kainate glutamate receptor overstimulation is known to be responsible for excitotoxic neuronal cell death. Moreover, administration of kainic acid (KA) produces characteristic patterns of epileptic seizure behavior in mice (18Coyle J.T. Ferkany J.W. Zaczek R. Neurobehav. Toxicol.

Dis. 2005; 18: 582-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Studies suggest that microglial activation in the hippocampi and the subsequent production of neurotoxic mediators such as reactive oxygen species and iNOS are responsible for KA-induced delayed cell death (20Wang Q.

Previous reports of TLR2 functioning as a receptor for dying neurons (14Kim D. Kim M.A. Cho I.H. Kim M.S. Lee S. Jo E.K. Choi S.Y. Park K. Kim J.S. Akira S. Na H.S. Oh S.B. Lee S.J. J. Biol.

In this study, we used TLR2 KO mice to test this hypothesis and demonstrated that microglial TLR2 expression contributes to KA-induced glial cell activation and hippocampal neuron excitotoxicity.DISCUSSIONThis study provides the first evidence that TLR2 contributes to KA-induced hippocampal cell death. It has been reported that TLR2 is constitutively expressed in microglia (41Bsibsi M. Ravid R. Gveric D. van Noort J.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 42Blasi E. Barluzzi R. Bocchini V. Mazzolla R. Bistoni F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 27: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar); however, we rarely detected TLR2 expression in unstimulated brain tissue by immunohistochemistry, probably due to the detection limits of this method. We did, however, observe TLR2 expression in microglia following treatment with KA. TLR2 was recently shown to be constitutively expressed in cortical neurons and to be required for oxygen/glucose deprivation-induced neuronal death (36Tang S.C. Arumugam T.V. Xu X. Cheng A. Mughal M.R. Jo D.G. Lathia J.D. Siler D.A. Chigurupati S. Ouyang X. Magnus T. Camandola S. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13798-13803Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). This report suggested that TLR2 expression on hippocampal neurons is directly involved in KA-induced neuronal death; however, in our study we failed to detect TLR2 expression in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we did not observe any difference in KA excitotoxicity between WT hippocampal neurons and TLR2-deficient neurons in vitro. Although these in vitro data do not completely negate the possibility of neuronal TLR2 effects in vivo, these data strongly suggest that TLR2 expression in other cell types may be involved in the KA excitotoxicity. Indeed, we observed a significant decrease in KA-induced hippocampal microglia activation in TLR2 KO mice compared with WT mice.Microglial activation during excitotoxic neuronal death is a well-known phenomenon (43Andersson P.B. Perry V.H. Gordon S. Neuroscience. 1991; 42: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In the model for KA-induced hippocampal neuronal death, activation of microglia was proposed to promote delayed neuronal cell death in the hippocampus (43Andersson P.B. Perry V.H. Gordon S. Neuroscience. 1991; 42: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 44Penkowa M. Florit S. Giralt M. Quintana A. Molinero A. Carrasco J. Hidalgo J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 522-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, it is not completely understood how microglial cells are activated during KA-induced hippocampal neuronal death. In this regard, it should be noted that necrotic neurons activate microglia through TLR2 activation (14Kim D. Kim M.A. Cho I.H. Kim M.S. Lee S. Jo E.K. Choi S.Y. Park K. Kim J.S. Akira S. Na H.S. Oh S.B. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14975-14983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Based on this, one can conjecture that endogenous TLR2 agonists are released from excitotoxic hippocampal neurons and activate nearby microglia via TLR2. Thus far, several endogenous molecules have been proposed to activate TLR2; for example, heat shock proteins (4Ohashi K. Burkart V. Flohé S. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar, 5Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. Ghose S. Kirschning C.J. Issels R.D. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15107-15112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) and HMGB-1 (6Park J.S. Svetkauskaite D. He Q. Kim J.Y. Strassheim D. Ishizaka A. Abraham E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7370-7377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar) have been shown to bind to TLR2. Notably, HMGB-1 has recently been shown to play a critical role in microglia activation and subsequent delayed cortical neuronal death in a mouse stroke model, and the authors suggested that HMGB-1 released from damaged neurons activates microglia (45Kim J.B. Sig Choi J. Yu Y.M. Nam K. Piao C.S. Kim S.W. Lee M.H. Han P.L. Park J.S. Lee J.K. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6413-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Based on previous reports, it is tempting to speculate that following KA treatment, damaged hippocampal neurons release HMGB-1, which activates nearby microglia via TLR2 and thereby further promotes delayed neuronal cell death. This possibility can be addressed in future studies using HMGB-1 KO mice.In addition to microglia activation, we observed macrophage infiltration in KA-injected hippocampi. Because TLR2 is expressed on blood-borne macrophages or other immune cells, the effects of TLR2 deletion in these cells cannot be completely ruled out. To differentiate between the role of blood-borne immune cells and brain-resident glial cells, we adopted an OHSC system in which hippocampal slices were cultured ex vivo for 2 weeks before KA stimulation to ensure that no blood-derived cells were present in the slices during KA stimulation. Data from this ex vivo system demonstrate that TLR2 potentiates KA-mediated excitotoxicity in the absence of blood-derived immune cells, and strongly suggest that TLR2 in microglia plays the major role in KA excitotoxicity. Still, these data do not completely rule out the putative contribution of blood-derived macrophages in vivo. A future study testing KA-excitotoxicity in TLR2 KO bone marrow-reconstituted WT mice or in microglia-specific TLR2 conditional KO mice would better define the relative contributions of TLR2 in glia and blood-borne immune cells.In this study, we also assessed the functional damage to the hippocampus after KA stimulation by measuring LTP. In accordance with a previous report (37Dumas T.C. McLaughlin J.R. Ho D.Y. Lawrence M.S. Sapolsky R.M. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 166: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), KA administration inhibited LTP induction in hippocampus of the WT slices. The difference between LTP in the KA-treated WT hippocampus compared with that of LTP in the PBS-treated WT hippocampus is in line with the decreased cell rate in the CA3 area after KA administration in WT mice. Interestingly, although KA injection reduced the neuronal cell number in CA3 of TLR2 KO mice by 20%, LTP induced in those slices was not affected at all by KA administration. Although there is no clear explanation for this discrepancy, it can be speculated that a certain level is required for hippocampal cell death to be detected in LTP assessment. In our study, KA-induced seizure activity measured by EEG was not significantly different between WT and TLR2 KO mice. Thus it seems that hippocampal excitotoxicity due to i.c.v. KA injection is not directly related to seizure activity.In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism underlying the TLR2 effects, we found that KA-induced expression of proinflammatory genes such as TNF-α and IL-1β is reduced in TLR2 KO mouse hippocampi. We tested the role of these proinflammatory cytokines in KA excitotoxicity using the OHSC system. Blocking cytokine effects in WT slices using neutralizing antibodies demonstrated that the cytokines potentiate KA-mediated hippocampal neuronal cell death ex vivo. These data are in line with previous reports showing the neurotoxic effects of these cytokines in vitro (46Downen M. Amaral T.D. Hua L.L. Zhao M.L. Lee S.C. Glia. 1999; 28: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 47Thornton P. Pinteaux E. Gibson R.M. Allan S.M. Rothwell N.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Of interest, neither TNF-α nor IL-1β alone induced neurotoxicity in the TLR2 KO slice at the concentrations used, but enhanced KA-induced cell death rate. This suggests that these cytokines make neurons more susceptible to KA excitotoxicity, although the mechanisms have not been elucidated in this study. In our study, we used an ex vivo slice culture system because in vivo experiments requiring repeated i.c.v. administration of neutralizing antibody together with KA injection were not technically feasible. Nevertheless, our ex vivo data strongly suggest that attenuation of these cytokines in TLR2 KO mice may be partly responsible for suppression of KA-induced hippocampal cell death in vivo. Besides proinflammatory cytokines, we observed that KA-induced iNOS and HO-1 expression is attenuated in TLR2 KO mice. The neurotoxic effect of NO in excitotoxicity is well-known (39Ananth C. Gopalakrishnakone P. Kaur C. Hippocampus. 2003; 13: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Also, recent studies indicate that overexpression of HO-1, an antioxidant enzyme in the brain, may have neurotoxic effects (48Song L. Song W. Schipper H.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 2186-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 49Hsieh C.H. Rau C.S. Hsieh M.W. Chen Y.C. Jeng S.F. Lu T.H. Chen S.S. Toxicol. Sci. 2008; 101: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is conceivable that reduced NO production and HO-1 expression in microglia may also contribute to the attenuation of KA neurotoxicity in TLR2 KO mice.Emerging evidence from several studies implies that innate immune receptors, such as TLR, play a pivotal role in the development of various neurodegenerative diseases. As previously described, TLR2 is required for cortical neuronal death in a mouse cerebral ischemia model (36Tang S.C. Arumugam T.V. Xu X. Cheng A. Mughal M.R. Jo D.G. Lathia J.D. Siler D.A.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13798-13803Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) and is involved in neuronal cell death in a mouse Alzheimer disease model and in spinal cord injury (50Simard A.R. Soulet D.

Lacroix S. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12565-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that TLR2 contributes to KA-induced hippocampal neuronal cell death and, furthermore, that TLR2-mediated microglia activation and subsequent proinflammatory cytokine expression potentiates KA-induced hippocampal cell death. These data suggest that TLR2 might be a novel therapeutic target for treatment of delayed neuronal cell death caused by excitotoxic stimuli.

To date, more than 10 different TLR members have been identified that each recognizes a specific set of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by microorganisms (1Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6586) Google Scholar, 2Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4379) Google Scholar). Interestingly, emerging data indicate that TLRs function as receptors not only for PAMPs, but also for endogenous molecules released from damaged tissue or cells. For example, TLR2 and -4 recognize various endogenous molecules including heat shock proteins, hyaluronan, and high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) (3Termeer C. Benedix F. Sleeman J. Fieber C. Voith U.

Weissman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12542-12550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). It is possible that TLR recognition of these endogenous molecules is involved in the inflammatory response during “sterile” tissue damage.In the central nervous system (CNS), TLRs including TLR2, -3, and -4 are expressed in microglia and astrocytes, suggesting a role as innate immune cells in the CNS (8Kielian T. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 83: 711-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Based on their function as receptors for “danger signals” (9Matzinger P. Science. 2002; 296: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar), TLR expression in glial cells is implicated in various “sterile” neurological disorders including mouse cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (10Ziegler G.

We have also reported that TLR2 plays a critical role in nerve injury-induced spinal cord glial activation and subsequent pain hypersensitivity (14Kim D. Kim M.A. Cho I.H. Kim M.S. Lee S. Jo E.K.

In mouse epileptic seizure model, TLR2 transcripts are up-regulated in hippocampal microglia/macrophages upon pilocarpine injection (16Turrin N.P. Rivest S. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 16: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) implicating TLR2 in hippocampal excitotoxicity, although this possibility has not yet been explored.Excitotoxicity is an underlying mechanism of various neurological disorders including traumatic brain injury and stroke, and is also implicated in chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and epileptic seizure (17Doble A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 81: 163-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). NMDA and AMPA/kainate glutamate receptor overstimulation is known to be responsible for excitotoxic neuronal cell death. Moreover, administration of kainic acid (KA) produces characteristic patterns of epileptic seizure behavior in mice (18Coyle J.T. Ferkany J.W. Zaczek R. Neurobehav. Toxicol. Teratol. 1983; 5: 617-624PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sperk G. Lassmann H. Baran H. Seitelberger F. Hornykiewicz O. Brain Res. 1985; 338: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and triggers acute and delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions (20Wang Q. Yu S. Simonyi A. Sun G.Y.

Dis. 2005; 18: 582-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Studies suggest that microglial activation in the hippocampi and the subsequent production of neurotoxic mediators such as reactive oxygen species and iNOS are responsible for KA-induced delayed cell death (20Wang Q. Yu S. Simonyi A. Sun G.Y. Sun A.Y. Mol. Neurobiol. 2005; 31: 3-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mitchell J. Sundstrom L.E. Wheal H.V. Exp.

Previous reports of TLR2 functioning as a receptor for dying neurons (14Kim D. Kim M.A. Cho I.H. Kim M.S. Lee S. Jo E.K. Choi S.Y. Park K. Kim J.S. Akira S. Na H.S. Oh S.B. Lee S.J. J. Biol.

In this study, we used TLR2 KO mice to test this hypothesis and demonstrated that microglial TLR2 expression contributes to KA-induced glial cell activation and hippocampal neuron excitotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2065138510,"Oligopeptidase B (OPB) is a serine peptidase with dibasic substrate specificity. It is found in bacteria, plants, and trypanosomatid pathogens, where it has been identified as a virulence factor and potential drug target. In this study we expressed active recombinant Leishmania major OPB and provide the first structure of an oligopeptidase B at high resolution. The crystallographic study reveals that OPB comprises two domains, a catalytic and a propeller domain, linked together by a hinge region. The structure has been determined in complex with the oligopeptide, protease-inhibitor antipain, giving detailed information on the enzyme active site and extended substrate binding pockets. It shows that Glu-621 plays a critical role in the S1 binding pocket and, along with Phe-603, is largely responsible for the enzyme substrate specificity in P1. In the S2 binding pocket, Tyr-499 was shown to be important for substrate stability. The structure also allowed an investigation into the function of residues highlighted in other studies including Glu-623, which was predicted to be involved in the S1 binding pocket but is found forming an inter-domain hydrogen bond. Additional important salt bridges/hydrogen bonds between the two domains were observed, highlighting the significance of the domain interface in OPB. This work provides a foundation for the study of the role of OPBs as virulence factors in trypanosomatids. It could facilitate the development of specific OPB inhibitors with therapeutic potential by exploiting its unique substrate recognition properties as well as providing a model for OPBs in general."
https://openalex.org/W2148828623,"Autotransporters are bacterial virulence factors that share a common mechanism by which they are transported to the cell surface. They consist of an N-terminal passenger domain and a C-terminal β-barrel, which has been implicated in translocation of the passenger across the outer membrane (OM). The mechanism of passenger translocation and folding is still unclear but involves a conserved region at the C terminus of the passenger domain, the so-called autochaperone domain. This domain functions in the stepwise translocation process and in the folding of the passenger domain after translocation. In the autotransporter hemoglobin protease (Hbp), the autochaperone domain consists of the last rung of the β-helix and a capping domain. To examine the role of this region, we have mutated several conserved aromatic residues that are oriented toward the core of the β-helix. We found that non-conservative mutations affected secretion with Trp(1015) in the cap region as the most critical residue. Substitution at this position yielded a DegP-sensitive intermediate that is located at the periplasmic side of the OM. Further analysis revealed that Trp(1015) is most likely required for initiation of processive folding of the β-helix at the cell surface, which drives sequential translocation of the Hbp passenger across the OM."

Rsf-1 protein interacts with SNF2H to form an ISWI chromatin remodeling complex, RSF. In this study, we investigated the functional role of Rsf-1 by observing phenotypes after expressing it in nontransformed cells. Acute expression of Rsf-1 resulted in DNA damage as evidenced by DNA strand breaks, nuclear γH2AX foci, and activation of the ATM-CHK2-p53-p21 pathway, leading to growth arrest and apoptosis. Deletion mutation and gene knockdown assays revealed that formation of a functional RSF complex with SNF2H was required for Rsf-1 to trigger DNA damage response (DDR). Gene knock-out of TP53 alleles, TP53 mutation, or treatment with an ATM inhibitor abolished up-regulation of p53 and p21 and prevented Rsf-1-induced growth arrest. Chronic induction of Rsf-1 expression resulted in chromosomal aberration and clonal selection for cells with c-myc amplification and CDKN2A/B deletion. Co-culture assays indicated Rsf-1-induced DDR as a selecting barrier that favored outgrowth of cell clones with a TP53 mutation. The above findings suggest that increased Rsf-1 expression and thus excessive RSF activity, which occurs in tumors harboring Rsf-1 amplification, can induce chromosomal instability likely through DDR.

Chromatin remodeling is a fundamental process in several key biological activities such as nucleotide synthesis, transcription regulation, DNA repair, methylation, and recombination (1Ho L. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 2010; 463: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). This process is regulated by a group of nuclear protein complexes that assemble chromatin by sliding and spacing nucleosomes, allowing for accessibility of otherwise highly packaged DNA in nucleosomes to nuclear proteins, e.g. transcription factors, enhancers, repressors, and enzymes. This process is made possible by the ATPase subunit of the chromatin remodeling complex, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate energy needed to alter the chromatin architecture at the nucleosomal level. Based on sequence homology of the ATPase subunit, three subfamilies have been defined in mammalian cells: the ISWI, 3The abbreviations used are: ISWIimitation switchRSFremodeling and spacing factorOSEovarian surface epitheliumDDRDNA damage responseCCconfluent cellsDCdividing cellsQPCRquantitative real-time PCRMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastpCHK2phosphorylated check point kinase-2ATMataxia-telangiectasia mutated geneCGHcomparative genomic hybridization.

This amplicon was subsequently validated in two independent studies that profiled DNA copy number changes in ovarian carcinoma (8Nakayama K. Nakayama N. Jinawath N. Salani R. Kurman R.J. Shih Ie, M.

The minimal ch11q13.5 amplicon contains 13 genes; among them, Rsf-1 (HBXAP, hepatitis B virus X protein-associated protein) showed the highest correlation between DNA and RNA copy number in ovarian cancer tissues (7Shih Ie M.

It has been shown that SNF2H possesses nucleosome-dependent ATPase activity, whereas Rsf-1 (HBXAP) functions as a histone chaperone. As with other ISWI chromatin remodeling complexes, RSF has been reported to participate in nucleosome assembly and chromatin remodeling in response to various growth signals and environmental cues (13LeRoy G. Loyola A. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14787-14790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Loyola A. Huang J.Y. LeRoy G. Hu S. Wang Y.H. Donnelly R.J.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2837-2851PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, RSF has been shown to interact with centromere protein A (CENP-A) histone, suggesting critical roles of the RSF complex during DNA replication and segregation (17Perpelescu M. Nozaki N. Obuse C. Yang H. Yoda K. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Rsf-1 protein level correlated with that of SNF2H in human cancer tissues, and ectopic expression of Rsf-1 increased protein levels of SNF2H probably through formation of a stabilized RSF complex (16Sheu J.J. Choi J.H. Yildiz I. Tsai F.J. Shaul Y. Wang T.L. Shih I.M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Rsf-1 knockdown or disruption of RSF complex formation inhibited cell growth in OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, which harbor Rsf-1 amplification and thus express abundant endogenous Rsf-1, but not in other cancer cells without Rsf-1 amplification or overexpression (11Choi J.H. Sheu J.J. Guan B. Jinawath N. Markowski P. Wang T.L. Shih Ie M. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Sheu J.J. Choi J.H. Yildiz I. Tsai F.J. Shaul Y. Wang T.L. Shih I.M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that Rsf-1 amplification is critical in maintaining the survival and growth of ovarian cancer cells. To further understand the biological functions of Rsf-1 during tumor development, we determined the effects by ectopic expression of Rsf-1 in nontransformed cells including ovarian surface epithelial cells and RK3E cells. Findings suggest that Rsf-1 overexpression, as occurs in tumor cells with Rsf-1 amplification, can be detrimental to cells by inducing DNA damage, resulting in growth arrest and apoptosis. Still, in the presence of mutated p53 signaling, cells can continue undergoing cell division despite DNA damage, promoting chromosomal instability as observed in cancer cells. To determine the effects of Rsf-1 expression, IOSE-80pc cells were transduced by the Rsf-1/V5 lentivirus (18Choi J.H. Park S.H. Leung P.C. Choi K.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) because the virus offered a more efficient system to deliver gene than transfection in this cell line. For the Rsf-1-inducible expression system, a full-length Rsf-1 gene and Rsf-1 deletion mutants tagged with V5 (C-terminal) were cloned into a Tet-off expression vector, pBI-EGFP (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). RK3E cells were transfected with a tTA (tetracycline-controlled transactivator) vector to generate RK3E-tTA cells. Inducible expression vectors were then introduced into the RK3E-tTA cells, and the stable transfectants were selected by hygromycin (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and G418. Cells were grown in 96-well plates at a density of 3,000 cells per well. After overnight culture, the cells were washed with Dox-in (gene turned off) or Dox-free (gene turned on) medium. Cell number was measured at different times, based on fluorescence intensity of SYBR green I nucleic acid staining (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cell growth was monitored daily for 4 consecutive days. For colony formation assay, cells were seeded in 25-cm2 flasks at a density of 2,000 cells/flask with Dox-in or Dox-free medium. The colonies were counted after staining with crystal violet dye (Sigma) at day 10. To study possible involvement of ATM kinase in mediating Rsf-1-induced cell death, RK3E cells were treated with 100 nm or 200 nm CGK733 (Merck Biosciences; Darmstadt, Germany). Cells treated with equal concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide were used as controls. For apoptosis assay, apoptotic cells were detected by annexin V-FITC staining (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). Annexin V (+) cell percentage was calculated in at least 400 cells from different fields for each experiment. The data were expressed as mean ± S.D. from triplicates. Quantification of DNA strand breaks was determined using a Comet assay kit (Trevigen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) (19Singh N.P. McCoy M.T. Tice R.R. Schneider E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (9038) Google Scholar). Rsf-1 expressing and nonexpressing cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml. Cells treated with UV light at a sublethal dose were used as the positive control. Cells were mixed with LMAgarose at 1:10 ratio (v/v) and spread onto the CometSlide immediately. After gel solidification, slides were immersed in ice-cold lysis buffer provided by the kit for 45 min, followed by incubation in an alkaline solution provided by the kit at room temperature for one hour. Fragmented DNA strands were separated from nuclei by electrophoresis and detected by SYBR Green staining. Percentage of comet-like nuclei (with DNA strand breaks) was counted under fluorescent microscope from five randomly selected high power fields (40×) with each approximately containing 100 nuclei. Rsf-1-transduced ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) cells were used to determine whether Rsf-1 expression resulted in genomic instability. At different time points, cells on chamber slides were fixed with paraformaldehyde and incubated with anti-phospho-CHK2 (pCHK2) antibody (clone ab38461; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or anti-γH2AX antibody (clone ab11174; Abcam) for 2 h, and followed by rhodamin-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Cell nuclei were counter stained with DAPI (Sigma). To assess whether Rsf-1 expression resulted in an increase in chromosomal aberrations, we used an Rsf-1-inducible RK3E cell model in which Rsf-1 was repeatedly turned on for three passages then turned off for three passages to avoid acute growth arrest. After 10 cycles of repeated induction, cells were subjected to G-banding karyotyping, array CGH, and evaluation for abnormal mitotic figures. For G-banding karyotyping, cells were synchronized with 10 μg/ml colcemid (Invitrogen) for 3 h. Cells were then trypsinized and fixed with ice-cold fixation solution (methanol/glacial acetate = 3:1; v/v). After three washes with fixation buffer, the cell suspension was spotted onto slides, aged at 65 °C for 5 h, and were submitted to standard procedures of G-banding with trypsin. Images of 10 metaphases in which there was minimal chromosome overlap, long chromosome length, little or no cytoplasm, and high banding resolution were selected for detailed analysis. Abnormal mitotic figures including spindle pole number abnormality, anaphase bridges, and micronuclei were counted in ∼400 randomly selected nuclei and the percentage calculated. A genome-wide oligonucleotide array (Rat genome CGH microarray 244A; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) was used for array-CGH analysis. Genomic DNA fragmentation, labeling, and array hybridization were performed according to the standard protocol (version 4) provided by Agilent Technologies. DNA was isolated from Rsf-1 turned on cells as the experimental genome and those isolated from Rsf-1 turned off or control cells of the same batch as reference genome. The hybridized arrays were scanned with an Agilent G2565BA DNA microarray scanner and analyzed by Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 8.1.1). Another custom analytical software package, Agilent CGH Analytics (version 3.4) was also used for subsequent data analysis. Locations of the copy number aberrations were calculated using the Z-score statistical algorithm with a moving average window of 5 megabases. The Z-score threshold was set at 2.5 to make an amplification or deletion call. Based on these settings, the aberration score was generated automatically for each copy number altered loci. SMART pools of siRNA against SNF2H and p21 were purchased from Dharmacon RNAi Technologies. A scramble siRNA (catalogue no. D-001210-02-05) was also purchased from Dharmacon as the off-target control. For gene knockdown, cells were treated with siRNA at a final concentration of 200 nm using oligofectamine (Invitrogen). For Rsf-1-inducible RK3E cells, treated cells were washed with Dox-free (gene turned on) or Dox-in (gene turned off) medium 8 h after transfection. Cell growth assay was performed for 4 days under Dox-free or Dox-in medium to evaluate whether SNF2H or p21 knockdown could affect Rsf-1-induced cell growth arrest in RK3E cells. We demonstrated earlier that increasing Rsf-1 expression in ovarian cancer cells promotes tumor xenograft growth in mice (16Sheu J.J. Choi J.H. Yildiz I. Tsai F.J. Shaul Y. Wang T.L. Shih I.M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Yet, acute effects of Rsf-1 overexpression on nontransformed cells are not known. In this study, we selected an OSE cell line IOSE-80pc, a benign cellular counterpart of ovarian carcinoma (18Choi J.H. Park S.H. Leung P.C. Choi K.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and a Tet-off Rsf-1 inducible system in RK3E cells as models. The RK3E cell line was used because it has been widely used to assess transformational ability of potential oncogenes (20Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol.

First, we ectopically expressed Rsf-1 in IOSE-80pc cells using an Rsf-1-expressing lentivirus, with Rsf-1 expression detected by Western blot analysis and by immunostaining (Fig. 1, A and B). A consistent high expressing level of Rsf-1 was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR 12 h after virus transduction (Fig. 1C). The IOSE-80pc cell number was significantly reduced 4 days after transduction by Rsf-1/V5 lentivirus as compared with those transduced by control (vector only) virus (Fig. 1D). Apoptotic cells were increased in Rsf-1-expressing cells at days 3 and 4 (Fig. 1E). For RK3E cells, we induced Rsf-1 expression by removing doxycyclin from culture medium. Based on Western blot analysis, we detected Rsf-1 protein expression in Rsf-1 Tet-off RK3E clones as early as 6 h after induction (supplemental Fig. S1A). As compared with noninduced control cells, Rsf-1-induced clones grew more slowly in culture and exhibited increased apoptotic activity when cells were incubated in a low serum condition (0.5% FBS) based on annexin V staining (supplemental Fig. S1C). As compared with control cells, no evidence of increased number of senescent cells was observed in Rsf-1-overexpressing cells (data not shown). It has been established that certain oncogenes can induce cellular senescence and cell death in precancerous tissues by induction of DNA replication stress and activation of DNA damage responses (DDRs) (26Bartkova J. Horejsí Z. Koed K. Krämer A. Tort F. Zieger K. Guldberg P. Sehested M. Nesland J.M. Lukas C. Ørntoft T. Lukas J. Bartek J.

As our previous studies support an oncogenic potential of Rsf-1 (7Shih Ie M. Sheu J.J. Santillan A. Nakayama K. Yen M.J. Bristow R.E. Vang R. Parmigiani G. Kurman R.J. Trope C.G. Davidson B.

Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), it is likely that Rsf-1 induction can also cause DDRs and subsequent growth arrest in those nontransformed cells. To investigate this possibility, we measured protein levels of γH2AX, pCHK2, p53, and p21, all of which are involved in the DDR pathway (29Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 30Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar), in both IOSE-80pc cells and RK3E Rsf-1 inducible cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, Western blot analysis demonstrated increased protein levels not only of Rsf-1, but also of γH2AX, pCHK2, p53 and p21 6 h after Rsf-1 lentiviral transduction. Similarly, the same results in the expression patterns of Rsf-1, γH2AX, pCHK2, p53, and p21 were also observed in RK3E cells upon Rsf-1 induction (supplemental Fig. S2A). The above findings suggest DNA strand breaks induced by Rsf-1 expression. To determine whether this was the case, we analyzed DNA strand breaks in IOSE-80pc cells transduced by Rsf-1/V5 and compared with cells transduced by empty lentivirus, as well as in Rsf-1-induced and noninduced RK3E cells. Upon electrophoresis, DNA with strand breaks migrated out of nuclei forming a comet tail-like structure, whereas nondamaged DNA remained within nuclei. Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2B show a higher percentage of comet-like cells detected in Rsf-1-expressing IOSE-80pc cells and RK3E cells than in their control groups as early as 24 h after Rsf-1 expression. At all time points, the percentage of comet-like cells was significantly higher in Rsf-1-expressing cells than in controls. Immunofluorescence staining also demonstrated concomitant γH2AX and pCHK2 foci in nuclei of IOSE-80pc cells after Rsf-1 virus transduction (Fig. 2C) and in nuclei of RK3E cells after Rsf-1 induction (supplemental Fig. S2C). Because the DDR pathway is initiated by ATM/ATR (Ataxia-Telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein) activation, we further determined whether the growth inhibitory effects induced by Rsf-1 overexpression could be abolished by ATM inactivation. We treated RK3E Rsf-1-inducible cells with an ATM kinase inhibitor, CGK733. Western blotting showed expression levels of p53 and p21, the key effectors of DDRs (29Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 30Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar), were not altered despite Rsf-1 was turned on (Fig. 3A). Based on growth curve analysis and colony numbers, we found that the inhibitor was able to reverse growth suppression effect of Rsf-1 (Fig. 3, B and C). As a positive control, Rsf-1 knockdown by shRNA could rescue cells from cell growth inhibition as a result of Rsf-1 induction (supplemental Fig. S3). The above findings suggested ATM and p53 signaling as responsible for Rsf-1-induced growth suppression. It has been shown that DDR induced by excessive oncogene products is always coupled with DNA replication (28Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7773-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Using Rsf-1-inducible RK3E cells, we compared the ability to induce cell death, DNA strand breaks, and micronuclei formation between dividing and confluent cells after Rsf-1 expression. Fig. 4A depicts confluent cells (CC) with weaker pCHK2 and γH2AX staining after Rsf-1 turned on, as compared with the staining patterns in dividing cells (DC). Western blot and QPCR analyses confirmed equal expressing Rsf-1 levels between DC and CC cells, excluding possible effects caused by uneven Rsf-1 expressing levels (Fig. 4B). These results suggest reduction of Rsf-1-induced DDRs when cells are confluent. Fig. 4, C–E, demonstrates remarkable effects of Rsf-1 overexpression on cell survival, DNA break induction, and micronuclei formation, respectively, in DC cells as compared with CC cells. Our results indicated Rsf-1-induced DDRs occurring far more often in dividing cells than in confluent cells, suggesting that DNA replication is required for Rsf-1-induced DDR. Based on the data of anti-Rsf-1 co-immunoprecipitation, Rsf-1 was predominantly associated with SNF2H to form an RSF complex in ovarian cancer cells (16Sheu J.J. Choi J.H. Yildiz I. Tsai F.J. Shaul Y. Wang T.L. Shih I.M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), as well as in RK3E cells (supplemental Fig. S1B). Here, we asked whether this interaction is required for Rsf-1-induced growth arrest. SNF2H siRNA was used to suppress SNF2H expression and led to reduced expression levels of γH2AX and pCHK2 (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis revealed the effectiveness of siRNA to down-regulate the SNF2H expression in treated cells (Fig. 5B). We found >85% of cells negative for γH2AX, 57% negative for pCHK2 after SNF2H knockdown (Fig. 5C). Notably, SNF2H knockdown partially rescued Rsf-1-induced growth arrest (Fig. 5D), indicating that the interaction between Rsf-1 with SNF2H is required for growth arrest. A scramble siRNA did not cause similar effects as shown in SNF2H siRNAs (supplemental Fig. S4). Our previous study also demonstrated that Rsf-1/SNF2H interaction was mediated through the DDT and PHD domains on Rsf-1 (16Sheu J.J. Choi J.H. Yildiz I. Tsai F.J. Shaul Y. Wang T.L. Shih I.M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We determined whether the SNF2H binding motif in Rsf-1 containing both DDT and PHD domains was sufficient to induce growth arrest. To this end, we generated RK3E clones with a Tet-off inducible expression system for several Rsf-1 deletion mutants including Rsf-D1 (1–441 amino acids), Rsf-D3 (1–871 amino acids), D4 (1–973 amino acids) and D6 (982–1441 amino acids) (Fig. 5, E and F) (16Sheu J.J. Choi J.H. Yildiz I. Tsai F.J. Shaul Y. Wang T.L. Shih I.M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Of note, Rsf-D4 represented the minimal fragment of Rsf-1 that interacted with SNF2H. Interestingly, we did not observe significant growth inhibitory or apoptosis- enhancing effect in all clones expressing these deletion constructs, including the Rsf-D4 (Fig. 5G). This observation suggested that both the full-length Rsf-1 and SNF2H were required to form a functional RSF complex responsible for the growth suppression effects. DNA damage in excess of repair capacity has been shown to contribute to genomic instability and provide a mixture of genetically heterogeneous clones for Darwinian selection, thus propelling tumor development (26Bartkova J. Horejsí Z. Koed K. Krämer A. Tort F. Zieger K. Guldberg P. Sehested M. Nesland J.M. Lukas C. Ørntoft T. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nature. 2005; 434: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). To investigate the prolonged effect of Rsf-1 induction and assess its role in a biological context in nontransformed cells, we turned on and off the Rsf-1 expression periodically to prevent acute growth arrest and apoptosis. Here, we determined whether or not genomic alterations were increased in Rsf-1-inducible RK3E cells. The level of chromosomal aberration was determined by the percentage of abnormal mitosis, karyotypic aberration, and DNA copy number changes by comparing the Rsf-1-expressing cells to the control cells. First, we found that Rsf-1 induction increased the percentage of cells with abnormal mitoses including increased numbers of micronuclei, increased numbers of anapha"

We have used Drosophila melanogaster to determine whether O-GlcNAc metabolism plays a role in modulating Drosophila insulin-like peptide (dilp) production and insulin signaling. We employed transgenesis to either overexpress or knock down Drosophila Ogt(sxc) and Oga in insulin-producing cells (IPCs) or fat bodies using the GAL4-UAS system. Knockdown of Ogt decreased Dilp2, Dilp3, and Dilp5 production, with reduced body size and decreased phosphorylation of Akt in vivo. In contrast, knockdown of Oga increased Dilp2, Dilp3, and Dilp5 production, increased body size, and enhanced phosphorylation of Akt in vivo. However, knockdown of either Ogt(sxc) or Oga in the IPCs increased the hemolymph carbohydrate concentration. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Akt stimulated by extraneous insulin in an ex vivo cultured fat body of third instar larvae was diminished in strains subjected to IPC knockdown of Ogt or Oga. Knockdown of O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes in the fat body dramatically reduced neutral lipid stores. These results demonstrate that altered O-GlcNAc cycling in Drosophila IPCs modulates insulin production and influences the insulin responsiveness of peripheral tissues.

The O-GlcNAc modification is partly driven by the levels of UDP-GlcNAc derived from the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. This pathway is a nutrient-sensing pathway implicated in cellular signaling and insulin resistance. Two enzymes mediate cycling of O-GlcNAc: a glycosyltransferase (O-GlcNAc transferase; OGT) and a hexosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase; OGA). OGT-related sequences have been identified from Archaea to humans (3Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol.

Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 424-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These evolutionarily conserved proteins share a conserved structure. OGT contains tetratricopeptide repeats at the N terminus and a catalytic domain at the C terminus composed of Rossman-like folds. OGA, originally identified as meningioma-expressed autoantigen (termed MGEA5), is a member of the family 84 glycoside hydrolases (7Heckel D. Comtesse N. Brass N. Blin N. Zang K.D. Meese E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1859-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). OGA is also highly conserved in eukaryotic evolution from insects to humans. In mammals, the MGEA5 gene encodes at least two alternatively spliced transcripts. The longer of these was originally designated OGA and has a C-terminal MYST family histone acetyltransferase-like domain (8Toleman C.A. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol.

The N-terminal “hyaluronidase” domain has been proposed to be the catalytic site for OGA glycosidase activity and conforms to the Triosephosphate isomerase-barrel fold that typifies this class of glycosylhydrolases (1Hanover J.A.

In addition, the O-GlcNAcase was recently shown to be a type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene associated with obesity in the Mexican-American population (14Lehman D.M. Fu D.J. Freeman A.B. Hunt K.J.

Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1214-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Diabetes results from the failure of insulin production from the pancreatic β-cells and from insulin resistance in the peripheral tissues including liver, muscle, and white adipose tissue. Interestingly, transcripts encoding OGT are enriched in the pancreatic β-cells (15Hanover J.A. Lai Z. Lee G. Lubas W.A. Sato S.M. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that nutrient-driven O-GlcNAcylation of proteins through hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in the β-cells could alter insulin production. However, a suitable whole animal model in which to examine this problem has been lacking. Development of appropriate mouse knock-out models of the enzymes of hexosamine signaling has proven difficult because the pathway is essential in mammals. Knock-outs of OGT are embryonic and stem cell lethal (16Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Lazarus B.D. Kim E.J. Prinz W.A. Ashwell G. Krause M.W. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11952-11957Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our previous studies, and those of others, have demonstrated that many Drosophila proteins are modified by O-GlcNAc, suggesting that this modification may play a role in signaling in the fly model (21Kelly W.G. Hart G.W. Cell. 1989; 57: 243-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 22Jínek M. Rehwinkel J. Lazarus B.D. Izaurralde E. Hanover J.A. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how the cycling of O-GlcNAc on these target proteins is regulated by nutritional cues. Recently in Drosophila, ogt was identified as sxc (super sex combs), a gene regulating the homeotic genes that establish the adult body plan in the fly (23Gambetta M.C. Oktaba K. Müller J. Science. 2009; 325: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 24Sinclair D.A. Syrzycka M. Macauley M.S. Rastgardani T. Komljenovic I. Vocadlo D.J. Brock H.W. Honda B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13427-13432Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Flies harboring the loss of function alleles of ogt/sxc show arrested development. Null alleles of ogt/sxc arrest at third instar larvae or earlier and are thus not suitable for metabolic studies of the kind envisioned here. Despite these limitations, the fly provides an excellent, unexplored genetic model for examining the influence of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway on insulin signaling because the insulin-signaling pathway in Drosophila is highly conserved and similar to the mammalian insulin-signaling pathway (25Brogiolo W. Stocker H. Ikeya T. Rintelen F. Fernandez R. Hafen E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 213-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 26Tatar M. Bartke A. Antebi A. Science. 2003; 299: 1346-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). The Drosophila genome contains several Drosophila insulin-like peptide genes (dilp) with significant homology to mouse and human insulin (25Brogiolo W. Stocker H. Ikeya T. Rintelen F. Fernandez R. Hafen E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 213-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Drosophila has insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in morphologically discrete regions of the brain (27Cao C. Brown M.R. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 304: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Ablation of these IPCs in the fly results in elevation of trehalose and glucose levels in the hemolymph similar to the hyperglycemia observed in mammalian diabetes mellitus (28Rulifson E.J. Kim S.K. Nusse R. Science. 2002; 296: 1118-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 29Broughton S.J. Piper M.D. Ikeya T. Bass T.M. Jacobson J. Driege Y. Martinez P. Hafen E. Withers D.J. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Deletion of dilp1–5 causes delayed growth and increased carbohydrate levels in the hemolymph (30Zhang H. Liu J. Li C.R. Momen B. Kohanski R.A. Pick L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19617-19622Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Additionally, the Drosophila fat body is an organ that functions similarly to both mammalian liver and white adipose tissue (31Giannakou M.E. Goss M. Jünger M.A. Hafen E. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Science. 2004; 305: 361Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In this study, we have explored the possibility that O-GlcNAc cycling in the insulin-producing cells is a key mediator of insulin production regulating the insulin-signaling pathway in the fly. We established several transgenic loss or gain of function models of sxc/ogt (CG10392) or oga (CG5871), using the GAL4-UAS system. Using these transgenic flies, we found that tissue-specific, O-GlcNAc modulation altered insulin secretion from the IPCs, carbohydrate content in the hemolymph, body size, and insulin sensitivity. These phenotypes are consistent with insulin resistance in response to altered O-GlcNAc cycling and with associated changes in glucose-insulin homeostasis. The dILP2-GAL4 line was obtained from Dr. Eric Rulifson (University of California, San Francisco). The UAS-OGT line that contains Myc epitope tag in the N terminus (UAS-Myc-OGT) was made by P-element-mediated transformation. The Lsp2-GAL4 line (stock 6357) was obtained from Bloomington Stock center. UAS-RNAi lines of Ogt (stock 18611) and Oga (stock 41822) were obtained from Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center. w1118 crossed with dILP2-GAL4 or Lsp2-GAL4 was used as control as indicated. The stocks were maintained at 25 °C under constant humidity using standard sugar/yeast medium. In some experiments, adult flies were starved on 1.3% agar for 6 h. Brains of third instar larvae were dissected and fixed for 1 h with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 25 °C, and then tissues were treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 4 h at 4 °C, as a block for nonspecific antibody binding. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-Drosophila insulin (DILP) antiserum (gift from Dr. Eric Rulifson) was used at 1:200 and incubated with samples at 4 °C for overnight and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit as a secondary antibody. To evaluate cell toxicity in IPCs, brains were treated with TUNEL reaction solution from an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C. For positive control, 1 unit of DNase I (Invitrogen) was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C prior to TUNEL reaction. For staining of nucleus, the brains were stained with DAPI for 15 min at 25 °C. Confocal imaging was carried out on an LSM 410 microscope (Zeiss). Individual adult flies were weighed three times for accuracy. To compare the body size of third instar larvae, larvae were collected according to the protocol described previously (28Rulifson E.J. Kim S.K. Nusse R. Science. 2002; 296: 1118-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The larvae were digitally photographed at 6.5× magnification. We used the iVision Scientific Image Processing software (Biovision Technology, Exton, PA) to measure the pixel area of whole bodies. We evaluated the relative size values compared with control larvae. Total RNA from whole bodies of wandering third instar larvae was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed by the Superscript III system (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed using the 7900HT fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primers for quantitative real time PCR were as follows: dilp2F, CCTGCAGTTTGTCCAGGAGTTC; dilp2R, TCGCAGCGGTTCCGATAT; dilp3F, CAAACTGCCCGAAACTCTCT; dilp3R, CTCTTGGTCATTGCGTTGAA; dilp5F, AATTCAATGTTCGCCAAACG; dilp5R, CGCCAAGTGGTCCTCATAAT; Actin42F, CCATGTACCCGGGAATCG; and Actin42R, GAGCCAACGCCGTGATTT. Hemolymph samples were collected as described (27Cao C. Brown M.R. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 304: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate levels were evaluated by Dionex high performance anion exchange equipped with a pulsed amperometric detector (model PAD 2) and pellicular anion exchange column (PA 10, 4 × 250 mm). The concentration of each carbohydrate levels was determined by the absolute value of the area of the peak at standard sample. Whole bodies of 4-day-old adult flies were isolated in the protein extraction buffer (Pierce). Whole bodies or dissected fat bodies of wandering third instar larvae were isolated in the Drosophila homogenate buffer as described (29Broughton S.J. Piper M.D. Ikeya T. Bass T.M. Jacobson J. Driege Y. Martinez P. Hafen E. Withers D.J. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then incubated with phospho-Drosophila Akt (Ser-505) antibody or Akt antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) as primary antibody, and then membranes were incubated with IR800-labeled secondary antibodies (LI-COR). The blots were visualized using an imaging scanner (LI-COR). Fat bodies of wandering third instar larvae were dissected and cultured referring to the protocol (32Géminard C. Rulifson E.J. Léopold P. Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In brief, fat bodies were dissected in the Schneider's medium and incubated in the Schneider's medium for 4 h at 25 °C, and then 1 μg/ml insulin was administrated in the medium and cultured for another 15 min. Isolated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with Drosophila-specific p-Akt antibody (Ser-505) or Akt antibody. The values are expressed as the means ± S.E., unless otherwise stated. The mean values were compared using Student's t test. An asterisk in the figures indicates a significant difference from control (p < 0.05). We analyzed the effects of IPC-specific knockdown of endogenous ogt or oga by using the same driver, dILP2-GAL4, as described above to express a UAS-RNAi hairpin directed against ogt or oga (dILP2GAL4/+;UAS-dOGTRNAi/+ and dILP2GAL4/+;UAS-dOGARNAi/+). This dILP2-GAL4 line has been extensively used to target the IPCs in the fly and was previously used to ablate the median neurosecretory cells (28Rulifson E.J. Kim S.K. Nusse R. Science. 2002; 296: 1118-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The RNAi construct targeted to ogt was tested for its effectiveness using a strong tub-Gal4, which phenocopied Sxc null alleles by producing no adult offspring. Previous studies have shown that ablation of IPCs induces a decrease in the body size, and overexpression of dilp2 rescues the body size (28Rulifson E.J. Kim S.K. Nusse R. Science. 2002; 296: 1118-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). We analyzed the changes in body size in third instar larvae and adults, induced by interference with O-GlcNAc cycling. In third instar larvae, knockdown of Ogt significantly decreased body size (−12%) compared with control strains, whereas knockdown of Oga or overexpression of Ogt significantly increased the body size (+11 and +12%, respectively) (Fig. 1, A and B). The adult flies exhibited a similar modulation in body size (Fig. 1, C and D). These results demonstrate that altering O-GlcNAc cycling in the IPCs influences body size and suggests changes in DILP levels. DILP2, DILP3, and DILP5 are expressed in the IPCs, and the levels of these peptides modulate growth and body size (33Ikeya T. Galic M. Belawat P. Nairz K. Hafen E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1293-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Given the changes in body size that we detected in response to O-GlcNAc perturbation in the IPCs, we wanted to determine whether changes in O-GlcNAc cycling correlated with DILP levels. We measured dilp2, dilp3, and dilp5 transcripts by quantitative real time PCR using total RNA from wandering third instar larvae. Knockdown of Ogt decreased dilp2, dilp3, and dilp5 transcript levels compared with control (−60, −26, and −26%, respectively), whereas knockdown of Oga increased expression levels for all three dilps (+28, +55, and +57%, respectively) (Fig. 2A). DILP2 protein expression in the brain of third instar larvae was evaluated using a DILP2-specific antibody. DILP2 staining decreased with the knockdown of Ogt (Fig. 2B, OGT-RNAi) and increased with the knockdown of Oga (Fig. 2B, OGA-RNAi) compared with control. The targeted knockdown of Ogt or Oga was not toxic to the IPCs. TUNEL assay and DAPI staining of the nuclei did not reveal changes in chromatin structure that would be consistent with apoptosis or necrosis (Fig. 3). Additionally, the morphology of IPCs did not change with RNAi of O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes. These results suggest that deregulation of O-GlcNAc cycling induced by knockdown of either enzyme significantly altered DILP expression in the absence of overt toxicity to the IPCs. Insects contain two types of carbohydrate in circulating hemolymph: glucose and trehalose. The DILPs play an important role in regulating the levels of these circulating carbohydrates. To understand the role of altering DILP levels in this process, hemolymph carbohydrate levels for each strain were evaluated by high performance anion exchange-pulse amperometric detector. We have used this method to measure carbohydrate levels in C. elegans (19Hanover J.A. Forsythe M.E. Hennessey P.T. Brodigan T.M. Love D.C. Ashwell G. Krause M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11266-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Forsythe M.E. Love D.C. Lazarus B.D. Kim E.J. Prinz W.A. Ashwell G. Krause M.W. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11952-11957Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). An example of the separation profile illustrating the clear resolution of trehalose and glucose is shown (Fig. 4A, peaks 1 and 2, respectively). In both third instar larvae and adult flies, knockdown of Ogt increased hemolymph carbohydrate levels compared with control strains (+27%, +32%, respectively) (Fig. 4, B and C). Interestingly, knockdown of Oga correlated with increased hemolymph carbohydrate levels (+28 and +43%, respectively) (Fig. 4, B and C), even with increased DILP levels (Fig. 2). Therefore, deregulation of O-GlcNAc cycling by targeted knockdown of either enzyme in the IPCs resulted in higher circulating carbohydrate levels. Although higher carbohydrate levels might be expected from the lower production of DILPs (Ogt knockdown), the elevated carbohydrate associated with higher DILPs expression in the Oga knockdown was surprising. One possibility is that chronically elevated DILPs might lead to changes in signaling in insulin-responsive tissues, which normally take up hemolymph carbohydrate, possibly representing a kind of insulin resistance. We have reported previously that carbohydrate uptake and storage are perturbed in transgenic models with altered O-GlcNAc cycling in both mice and C. elegans (13McClain D.A. Lubas W.A. Cooksey R.C. Hazel M. Parker G.J. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10695-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 19Hanover J.A. Forsythe M.E. Hennessey P.T. Brodigan T.M. Love D.C. Ashwell G. Krause M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11266-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Forsythe M.E. Love D.C. Lazarus B.D. Kim E.J. Prinz W.A. Ashwell G. Krause M.W. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11952-11957Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The insulin-signaling pathway is required for growth and the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in Drosophila (34Teleman A.A. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 13-26Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To confirm the influence of altered O-GlcNAc cycling in the IPCs on the insulin-signaling pathway in the peripheral tissues, we used a Drosophila-specific phospho-Akt (p-Akt) antibody. Previous reports have shown that the phosphorylation site on Ser-505 in Drosophila Akt, corresponding to Ser-473 in mammalian Akt, is activated by extraneous insulin stimulation through the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase pathway in Drosophila culture cells (35Lizcano J.M. Alrubaie S. Kieloch A. Deak M. Leevers S.J. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In both third instar larvae and adult flies, targeted knockdown of Oga, but not knockdown of Ogt in the IPCs, increased the level of p-Akt compared with control (+35 and +29%, respectively) (Fig. 5, A and B). These results suggest that altering O-GlcNAc cycling in the IPCs affects the insulin-signaling pathway in peripheral tissues in a manner consistent with persistent elevated circulating DILP levels. In insects, the fat body is responsible for the uptake of hemolymph carbohydrate and for modulating energy storage (32Géminard C. Rulifson E.J. Léopold P. Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). DILPs, in part, regulate carbohydrate uptake by the fat body. We examined the effect of extraneous insulin administration in ex vivo cultured fat bodies from third instar larvae using an established protocol (32Géminard C. Rulifson E.J. Léopold P. Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Fat bodies were dissected and cultured and then treated with 1 μg/ml of insulin for 15 min. We then evaluated the response in the insulin-signaling pathway using Western blot analysis with a p-Akt antibody. Under basal conditions (Fig. 5C, Insulin (−)), p-Akt was not detectable in any of the strains, although equivalent amounts of Akt were present as demonstrated using a pan-Akt antibody (Fig. 5C, Akt). In the control strain, insulin dramatically increased the level of p-Akt. However, the level of p-Akt was significantly less when either Ogt or Oga were knocked down in the IPCs (−41 and −42%, respectively) (Fig. 5C, Insulin (+)). Intriguingly, both elevation of DILPs by Oga knockdown and reduction in DILPs by Ogt knockdown lead to a reduction in insulin responsiveness in this target tissue. These results confirm that modulating O-GlcNAc cycling in the IPCs diminishes the acute response to insulin in the peripheral tissues. Previously, we have demonstrated that disrupted O-GlcNAc cycling alters insulin signaling in the worm and mouse (13McClain D.A. Lubas W.A. Cooksey R.C. Hazel M. Parker G.J. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10695-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 19Hanover J.A. Forsythe M.E. Hennessey P.T. Brodigan T.M. Love D.C. Ashwell G. Krause M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11266-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Forsythe M.E. Love D.C. Lazarus B.D. Kim E.J. Prinz W.A. Ashwell G. Krause M.W. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11952-11957Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This phenomenon has also been observed in tissue culture models of insulin resistance. To more directly examine the role of O-GlcNAc cycling in peripheral tissues of the fly, we directed Oga and Ogt knockdown in the fat body using the Lsp2-GAL4 fat body-specific driver strain and examined neutral lipid storage (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, knockdown of either enzyme of O-GlcNAc cycling dramatically reduced the accumulation of neutral lipids in the fat body. Accompanying these macronutrient storage changes were alterations in the levels of several lipogenic and lipolytic enzymes including acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, lipase 4, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). These transcriptional changes differed between starved (supplemental Fig. S1) and fed flies (supplemental Fig. S2), with Ogt knockdown having a greater effect in starvation, and the Oga knockdown producing more striking effects upon feeding. Taken together, these findings suggest that O-GlcNAc plays a role in mediating the response to nutrient flux in a peripheral tissue involved in fat storage; this function may complement its role in regulating insulin production in IPCs in response to nutrients. This suggests that deregulation of O-GlcNAc cycling could contribute to both altered insulin production and insulin signaling in peripheral tissues in a manner reminiscent of mammalian insulin resistance. Here we show that targeted disruption of O-GlcNAc cycling in the IPCs modulates the production of the DILPs. These perturbations are associated with profound changes in body size and growth, as well as insulin sensing in target tissue. These phenotypes suggest that IPCs are acutely sensitive to alterations in O-GlcNAc cycling. To date, a variety of model systems have been examined with regard to the physiological role of O-GlcNAc cycling. In plants, the two OGT homologs Spindly and Secret Agent appear to play key roles in development (5Hartweck L.M. Scott C.L. Olszewski N.E. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1279-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Thornton T.M. Swain S.M. Olszewski N.E. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 424-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The OGT knock-out in mice produces stem cell and embryonic lethality; the conditional knock-outs survive only until embryonic day 5.5 (16Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that C. elegans null alleles of OGT and OGA were viable and fertile with changes in insulin-like signaling (19Hanover J.A. Forsythe M.E. Hennessey P.T. Brodigan T.M. Love D.C. Ashwell G. Krause M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11266-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Forsythe M.E. Love D.C. Lazarus B.D. Kim E.J. Prinz W.A. Ashwell G. Krause M.W. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11952-11957Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). More recently we have used these mutants to evaluate the dynamic cycling of O-GlcNAc at promoters of genes involved in longevity, the stress response, and pathogen resistance. These genes become deregulated in the mutants leading to changes in longevity, dauer, and stress (37Love D.C. Ghosh S. Mondoux M.A. Fukushige T. Wang P. Wilson M.A. Iser W.B. Wolkow C.A. Krause M.W. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7413-7418Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The differences observed between the phenotypes in mammals and nematodes are likely due to the importance of O-GlcNAc cycling in early development. Thus, it has become important to examine the role of O-GlcNAc cycling more broadly, to define its role as a nutrient-sensing post-translational modification. In Drosophila, ogt/Sxc (CG10392) and oga (CG5871) are highly similar to the mammalian ncOGT and OGA genes, respectively. We have previously examined the results of Ogt/Sxc knockdown in Drosophila S2 cells (22Jínek M. Rehwinkel J. Lazarus B.D. Izaurralde E. Hanover J.A. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have linked Ogt/Sxc to the regulation of homeotic gene expression in Drosophila (23Gambetta M.C. Oktaba K. Müller J. Science. 2009; 325: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 24Sinclair D.A. Syrzycka M. Macauley M.S. Rastgardani T. Komljenovic I. Vocadlo D.J. Brock H.W. Honda B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13427-13432Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Therefore, Drosophila has emerged as a genetically amenable and convenient model system for evaluating the physiological role of O-GlcNAc. In our current studies, perturbation of Drosophila O-GlcNAc cycling in IPCs by GAL4+UAS-RNAi results in the deregulation of Dilp production and increases in circulating carbohydrate levels in the hemolymph. These changes are not unlike the phenotypes of diabetes mellitus in mammals. We demonstrated that fly strains were still viable even with the targeted overexpression of Ogt or the knockdown of Ogt or Oga in DILP2-expressing cells. The generation of viable transgenic Drosophila strains overexpressing or depleting Ogt or Oga activity in discrete tissues allows a direct examination of the role that the O-GlcNAc modification may play in the metabolism and physiology of the fly. Previous studies suggested that in mammalian pancreatic β-cells, insulin expression and secretion might be linked to the hexosamine-signaling pathway. Transgenic mice overexpressing glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme for hexosamine-signaling pathway, in the pancreas exhibit increased insulin content in pancreatic islets and associated hyperinsulinemia (38Tang J. Neidigh J.L. Cooksey R.C. McClain D.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1492-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has been shown that glucose-induced transient hyperglycemia in rats resulted in a corresponding transient increase in O-GlcNAc protein levels in pancreatic β-cells (39Konrad R.J. Janowski K.M. Kudlow J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the MIN6 β-cell line, depletion of OGT using siRNA markedly inhibited glucose-induced insulin release (40Andrali S.S. Qian Q. Ozcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15589-15596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These reports strongly suggest that glucose-stimulated insulin production may be modulated by the O-GlcNAc modification. The Drosophila genome contains seven dilp genes. Previous studies have shown that the expression of UAS-rpr by the IPCs-specific driver, dILP2-GAL4, decreased dilp2, dilp3, and dilp5 gene expression (28Rulifson E.J. Kim S.K. Nusse R. Science. 2002; 296: 1118-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 33Ikeya T. Galic M. Belawat P. Nairz K. Hafen E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1293-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Additionally, deletion of dilps1–5 decreased body size and elevated carbohydrate levels (30Zhang H. Liu J. Li C.R. Momen B. Kohanski R.A. Pick L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19617-19622Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In our study, targeting only Ogt or Oga by RNAi modulated dilp2, dilp3, and dilp5 gene expression and altered body size, without overt changes in IPC viability. These results support the notion that O-GlcNAc modification is a key modulator for DILP production and release by Drosophila IPCs. The Drosophila fat body is responsible for the uptake of hemolymph carbohydrate and for modulating energy storage (32Géminard C. Rulifson E.J. Léopold P. Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown that either ablation of IPCs or deletion of dilps in Drosophila induces elevated carbohydrate levels in the hemolymph (28Rulifson E.J. Kim S.K. Nusse R.

In mammals, insulin regulates the blood glucose level via translocation of GLUT4, the glucose transporter, to the plasma membrane in the insulin-responsive tissues. This mechanism is mediated through the PI3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. The insulin-signaling pathway in Drosophila is highly conserved and similar to the mammalian insulin-signaling pathway (25Brogiolo W. Stocker H. Ikeya T. Rintelen F. Fernandez R. Hafen E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 213-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 31Giannakou M.E. Goss M. Jünger M.A. Hafen E. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Science. 2004; 305: 361Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). PI3-kinase/Akt signaling in Drosophila peripheral tissues is required for growth. Overexpression of PTEN, the negative regulator of PI3-kinase, inhibited fly body size (41Goberdhan D.C. Paricio N. Goodman E.C. Mlodzik M. Wilson C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3244-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The role of O-GlcNAc cycling in insulin-glucose-homeostasis is more complex. In our studies, knockdown of Oga in the IPCs increased the endogenous activation of Akt in vivo; this was expected to occur given the elevation of insulin expression and increased body size. However, this strain also showed increased hemolymph carbohydrate levels similar to that seen with knockdown of Ogt in the IPCs. Both knockdown of Ogt and of Oga in the IPCs diminished the activation of Akt by extraneous acute insulin administration in the ex vivo cultured fat body. Although the mechanism of induction of this altered insulin response in the Drosophila peripheral tissues is not clear, these results suggest that both strains exhibit a reduction in the responsiveness of the insulin-signaling pathway. This pathway is known to be required for glucose uptake into peripheral tissues, such as the fat body. Diabetes in mammals involves altered insulin secretion in the pancreatic β-cell and peripheral insulin resistance. In mammals, insulin resistance causes impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia because of reduction of glucose uptake via GLUT4 translocation mediated through impairment PI3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway (42Zierath J.R. Krook A. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 821-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 43Garvey W.T. Maianu L. Zhu J.H. Brechtel-Hook G. Wallace P. Baron A.D. J. Clin.

Hyperglycemia is responsible for insulin resistance, mediated by several factors, such as oxidative stress, cytokine activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Some reports suggest that sustained hyperinsulinemia may also lead to insulin resistance (44Del Prato S. Leonetti F. Simonson D.C. Sheehan P. Matsuda M. DeFronzo R.A.

Hyperglycemia then causes compensation of insulin production and deterioration of insulin resistance, ultimately leading to deregulation of insulin production. This vicious circle is known as glucose toxicity, which is essential in the progression of type 2 diabetes (36Rossetti L. Giaccari A. DeFronzo R.A. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 610-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that inhibition of O-GlcNAc levels by knockdown of Ogt in the IPCs induces hyperglycemia because of impairment of insulin production. Continuous increases in O-GlcNAcylation by knockdown of Oga in the IPCs mimic the compensation of insulin production for chronic hyperglycemic phenomena related to glucose toxicity. In human genetic studies, a single nucleotide polymorphism in intron 10 of the MEGA5 gene encoding OGA is associated with diabetes mellitus and age of onset in the Mexican-American population. This polymorphism may interfere with OGA activity in the susceptible population (14Lehman D.M. Fu D.J. Freeman A.B. Hunt K.J. Leach R.J. Johnson-Pais T. Hamlington J. Dyer T.D. Arya R. Abboud H.

https://openalex.org/W2079420184,"Remodeling of the fibronectin matrix occurs during a variety of pathological and regenerative processes. Cellular generated tensional forces can alter the secondary and tertiary structure of the fibronectin matrix and regulate the exposure of cryptic activities that directly impact cell behavior. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the partially unfolded Type III fibronectin module, FnIII-1c, on gene expression in dermal fibroblasts. Microarray and PCR analysis indicated that the addition of FnIII-1c to human dermal fibroblasts induced the expression of several inflammatory genes including the cytokines, IL-8 and TNF-α. ELISA analysis indicated that the increased gene expression was accompanied by the secretion of IL-8 and TNF-α protein. FnIII-1c-induced gene expression was preceded by increased phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK) and IκBα as well as the nuclear translocation of NFκB. PCR and ELISA analysis showed that inhibition of the NFκB signaling pathway completely blocked the induction of IL-8 and TNF-α. Blocking antibodies to Toll-like receptor 4 inhibited both the activation of the NFκB signaling pathway as well as cytokine expression in response to FnIII-1c. These data suggest that fibronectin matrix remodeling can induce the expression of cytokines by stromal cells present in the tissue microenvironment."

It is suggested that this clytin-cgGFP structure corresponds to the transient complex previously postulated to account for the energy transfer effect of GFP in the bioluminescence of aequorin or Renilla luciferase. IntroductionThe bioluminescence of many marine coelenterates, well-studied examples being the jellyfish Aequorea and the sea-pansy Renilla, involves the interaction of two proteins, a Ca2+-regulated photoprotein in the jellyfish case, aequorin, and its cognate green-fluorescent protein, Aequorea GFP (1Shimomura O. Bioluminescence: Chemical Principles and Methods. World Scientific, Singapore2006Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Addition of Ca2+ to the purified aequorin produces a blue bioluminescence. It was early recognized that, in the jellyfish itself, the in vivo bioluminescence was a green color and after further study, the origin of this green emission was identified as the GFP. A Förster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) 3The abbreviations used are: FRETFörster resonance energy transfercgGFPgreen-fluorescent protein from jellyfish C. gregariaHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopyITCisothermal titration calorimetryRMSDroot mean square deviationAIRambiguous interaction restraint. mechanism was invoked to explain how this bioluminescence spectrum is shifted (2Morin J.G. Hastings J.W. J. Cell Physiol. 1971; 77: 313-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the well-known Förster theory requires concentrations of the donor-acceptor partners in the millimolar range, whereas in some bioluminescence systems, e.g. from the sea pansy Renilla and also the jellyfish Clytia subject herein, the GFP effect on the in vitro bioluminescence is observed at micromolar concentrations (3Ward W.W. Cormier M.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1976; 80: 2289-2291Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Clearly the bioluminescence interaction has to involve formation of a complex and, in the case of Renilla, the formation of a luciferase-GFP complex has been shown (3Ward W.W. Cormier M.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1976; 80: 2289-2291Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar).In this work, we have determined by x-ray crystallography the spatial structures of the recombinant Ca2+-regulated photoprotein clytin and Clytia GFP (cgGFP), which were cloned from a single specimen of Clytia gregaria (syn. Phialidium gregarium). Based on the structures, NMR titration experiments were employed to identify the interaction surfaces in a complex of both proteins. For a mixture of clytin and cgGFP at millimolar concentration, 1H-15N HSQC experiments revealed perturbation of chemical shifts of the separate proteins, which could be mapped to particular residues being affected by complexation. The NMR experiments also indicated that the association was weak but from knowledge of the interaction surface, computational docking was employed to propose an overall three-dimensional structure of the clytin-cgGFP complex.DISCUSSIONEnergy transfer or the bioluminescence color shift on the addition of GFP, has previously received detailed study for two bioluminescence systems, that of aequorin and of Renilla luciferase (3Ward W.W. Cormier M.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1976; 80: 2289-2291Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 42Morise H. Shimomura O. Johnson F.H. Winant J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2656-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 44Ward W.W. Cormier M.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 27: 389-396Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 45Ward W.W.

The mechanism has been proposed to be by FRET within a transient protein-protein complex. According to the well-known FRET equation, the probability or rate of energy transfer, from the excited donor to the acceptor, depends on several parameters, most critical being the donor-acceptor separation and the spectral overlap of donor fluorescence and acceptor absorption. A convenient measure is the “Förster separation” where the probability of the donor radiative S1 → S0 transition equals the probability of energy transfer populating the acceptor S1 state; in almost all cases this distance is less than 10 nm. This means that for the partners randomly distributed in free solution, they need to be in the millimolar concentration range. The bioluminescence color shifts however, are observed at micromolar protein concentrations so for FRET to be feasible the donor-acceptor separation must be constrained within a protein-protein complex.For the Renilla luciferase bioluminescence in particular, the addition of Renilla GFP at micromolar concentrations, not only produced the green color shift but enhanced the bioluminescence quantum yield about three times. This is conclusive evidence for FRET indicating that efficient excited state coupling in the transient complex competes with both radiative and non-radiative deactivation pathways of the primary excited S1 state formed by the reaction on the luciferase. A stable complex was not observed by direct methods, chromatography, fluorescence anisotropy, at these micromolar concentrations. However, using the Hummell-Dryer chromatographic method, Ward and Cormier (45Ward W.W. Cormier M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 57: 257-267Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported the presence of a Renilla luciferase-Renilla GFP complex. Further evidence that such a complex must be involved for the bioluminescence shift was that the energy transfer was specific for the type of GFP, it occurred with GFPs from other species of Renilla but not from GFPs of more distantly related organisms. Also, the shift effect was negated by amino acid modification in the GFP and by higher ionic strength in the buffer (>100 mm) (Fig. 6).A complex has also been reported for the aequorin-Aequorea GFP bioluminescence using the Hummel-Dryer method (47Cutler, M. W. (1995) Ph.D. Thesis, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.Google Scholar). In that case no bioluminescence quantum yield increase accompanying the energy transfer was observed (42Morise H. Shimomura O. Johnson F.H. Winant J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2656-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) as also the case here for the clytin bioluminescence in Fig. 5A. Morise et al. (42Morise H. Shimomura O. Johnson F.H. Winant J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2656-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) however, demonstrated that energy transfer was significantly enhanced in a suspension of DEAE particles on which the aequorin and Aequorea GFP had been co-adsorbed, presumably bringing the two partners to proximity, but the color shift was also observed to an unrelated acceptor, FMN, meaning that it was nonspecific.The observations on the clytin bioluminescence system reported here bear similarity to these earlier reports. The clytin bioluminescence spectrum is shifted to the fluorescence of cgGFP by only micromolar concentrations of cgGFP, the effect is diminished by modification of amino acid residues in the clytin, which otherwise affect no change in the clytin bioluminescence properties, the cgGFP shift is an order of magnitude less effective using the distantly related photoprotein obelin, even though with this pair, the spectral overlap is significantly higher (4Markova S.V. Burakova L.P. Frank L.A. Golz S. Korostileva K.A. Vysotski E.S. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2010; 9: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the KET is reduced but not eliminated at increased ionic strength.Additional similarity to earlier reports was that no clytin-cgGFP interaction in the micromolar range could be detected by the methods of fluorescence anisotropy, analytical ultracentrifugation, or plasmon resonance (results not shown). However, in contrast to the cases of Renilla and aequorin just mentioned, Markova et al. (4Markova S.V. Burakova L.P. Frank L.A. Golz S. Korostileva K.A. Vysotski E.S. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2010; 9: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) recently observed no complex by Hummel-Dryer chromatography using a starting concentration ten times higher than Ward and Cormier used for their Renilla experiment. Altogether, we estimate here a 0.9 mm value for the clytin-cgGFP affinity constant, consistent with the weak Keq in the mm range inferred from the NMR perturbations.Although the computational model in Fig. 3 needs to be interpreted with appropriate reservation, we point out that the spatial arrangement of the donor and acceptor makes it attractive to consider this complex as the functional bioluminescence unit in vitro. There is a very favorable spectral overlap, 1.3 × 10−13 m−1 cm3, between the bioluminescence from clytin, maximum 470 nm, and the absorption of cgGFP, having a monomer extinction coefficient of 64,000 m−1 cm−1 at 485 nm (4Markova S.V. Burakova L.P. Frank L.A. Golz S. Korostileva K.A. Vysotski E.S. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2010; 9: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Combined with the 45 Å separation of the donor and acceptor in the structure of the complex (Fig. 3), and the fact that the cgGFP will be dimerized in the complex, the electronic transitions are very strongly coupled. The energy from the bioluminescence reaction of the clytin will be quantitatively deposited into the excited state of the acceptor, the cgGFP. However, as the protein-protein complex is weak with a dissociation constant (Keq) in the millimolar range according to the NMR chemical shift and ITC methods (Fig. 7), the mechanism by which added cgGFP at only micromolar concentrations is able to shift the bioluminescence toward the fluorescence of cgGFP, remains to be established.The computational structure of the clytin-cgGFP complex resembles features of a weak protein-protein complex predominantly governed by electrostatic forces, with a low number of total intermolecular contacts (39Reichmann D. Rahat O. Cohen M. Neuvirth H. Schreiber G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 40Prudêncio M. Ubbink M. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 524-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 41Kiel C. Selzer T. Shaul Y. Schreiber G. Herrmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9223-9228Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For a weak protein interaction the relatively high value of the clytin-cgGFP buried surface area (1,913 Å) derives from the impact of the distal (flexible) part of the clytin N terminus interacting with the top cgGFP barrel loops which together account for 30% of the total buried surface. However, intermolecular contacts in this region are minimal and the position of the clytin N terminus itself is highly variable among the best batch of structures, which implies a less significant impact of the distal part of the clytin N terminus compared with its proximal part and the α-helix D carrying the positive charge. This conclusion is supported by mutagenesis of clytin where we observe that deletion of the flexible part of the N terminus has the same effect on complex affinity and cgGFP color shift efficiency as the single substitutions K11A and K13A. These substitutions evidently affect electrostatics similarly to the high ionic strength conditions.The question arises as to the physiological relevance of this clytin-cgGFP computational structure in Fig. 3. The photocytes of the jellyfish Aequorea and Clytia can be assumed to be the same, contain concentrations of the bioluminescence proteins estimated to be in the millimolar range (42Morise H. Shimomura O. Johnson F.H. Winant J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2656-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 47Cutler, M. W. (1995) Ph.D. Thesis, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.Google Scholar), similar to the concentrations required to form the complex detected by the NMR and ITC experiments. The in vivo bioluminescence spectra of several animals or their tissue samples, reveal nearly exact correspondence to the fluorescence of GFP, i.e. no contribution from the blue emission implying near 100% FRET efficiency (50Morin J.G. Hastings J.W. J. Cell Physiol. 1971; 77: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 52Wampler J.E. Hori K. Lee J.W. Cormier M.J. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2903-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 53Wampler J.E. Karkhanis Y.D. Morin J.G. Cormier M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 314: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This demands that the origin of the emission is from a complex where the donor and acceptor have restricted separation and orientation. The inhibition of the GFP shift at increased salt concentration is consistent with electrostatic forces at the protein-protein interface driving the clytin-cgGFP complexation. This would argue against this same spatial structure existing in vivo if within the photocytes, the ionic strength approaches that of sea-water, or is even as low as that characteristic of eukaryotic cells, 100–150 mm because of potassium ions. On the other hand, several bioluminescent organisms are found to contain their bioluminescence systems within membrane enclosed vesicles, “lumisomes” in Renilla (54Anderson J.M. Cormier M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2937-2943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and “scintillons” in the dinoflagellates (43Nicolas M.T. Nicolas G. Johnson C.H. Bassot J.M. Hastings J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Such vesicles apparently modulate the intracellular environment for the benefit of the bioluminescence function (50Morin J.G. Hastings J.W. J. Cell Physiol. 1971; 77: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Because cgGFP itself is a tight dimer it is probable that in vivo the clytin-cgGFP complex is a heterotetramer. It should be noted that this supposition was advanced for in vivo aequorin-Aequorea GFP complex (51Cutler M.W. Ward W.W. Hastings J.W. Kricka L.J. Stanley P.E. Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence: Molecular Reporting with Photons.

Whether the spatial structure of the in vivo complex relates to that determined here at low ionic strength, hopefully will be proven by crystallography, although for a weak protein-protein complex this methodology presents its own set of impediments. IntroductionThe bioluminescence of many marine coelenterates, well-studied examples being the jellyfish Aequorea and the sea-pansy Renilla, involves the interaction of two proteins, a Ca2+-regulated photoprotein in the jellyfish case, aequorin, and its cognate green-fluorescent protein, Aequorea GFP (1Shimomura O. Bioluminescence: Chemical Principles and Methods. World Scientific, Singapore2006Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Addition of Ca2+ to the purified aequorin produces a blue bioluminescence. It was early recognized that, in the jellyfish itself, the in vivo bioluminescence was a green color and after further study, the origin of this green emission was identified as the GFP. A Förster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) 3The abbreviations used are: FRETFörster resonance energy transfercgGFPgreen-fluorescent protein from jellyfish C. gregariaHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopyITCisothermal titration calorimetryRMSDroot mean square deviationAIRambiguous interaction restraint. mechanism was invoked to explain how this bioluminescence spectrum is shifted (2Morin J.G. Hastings J.W. J. Cell Physiol. 1971; 77: 313-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the well-known Förster theory requires concentrations of the donor-acceptor partners in the millimolar range, whereas in some bioluminescence systems, e.g. from the sea pansy Renilla and also the jellyfish Clytia subject herein, the GFP effect on the in vitro bioluminescence is observed at micromolar concentrations (3Ward W.W. Cormier M.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1976; 80: 2289-2291Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Clearly the bioluminescence interaction has to involve formation of a complex and, in the case of Renilla, the formation of a luciferase-GFP complex has been shown (3Ward W.W. Cormier M.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1976; 80: 2289-2291Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar).In this work, we have determined by x-ray crystallography the spatial structures of the recombinant Ca2+-regulated photoprotein clytin and Clytia GFP (cgGFP), which were cloned from a single specimen of Clytia gregaria (syn. Phialidium gregarium). Based on the structures, NMR titration experiments were employed to identify the interaction surfaces in a complex of both proteins. For a mixture of clytin and cgGFP at millimolar concentration, 1H-15N HSQC experiments revealed perturbation of chemical shifts of the separate proteins, which could be mapped to particular residues being affected by complexation. The NMR experiments also indicated that the association was weak but from knowledge of the interaction surface, computational docking was employed to propose an overall three-dimensional structure of the clytin-cgGFP complex."

However, molecular mechanisms that control these processes are not well understood. We have found that the BMP signaling downstream transcription factor SMAD1 and CRMP2 (collapsin response mediator protein-2) are inversely and complementarily expressed in the developing neocortex. BMPs can suppress CRMP2 expression in cortical cells. Our ChIP assay demonstrates that both SMAD1 and -4 bind to CRMP2 promoter in the neocortex, and overexpression of SMAD1 and 4 in vivo suppresses CRMP2 expression. RNA interference of CRMP2 and overexpression of dominant negative forms of CRMP2 in utero cause accumulation of multipolar cells in the ventricular, subventricular, and intermediate zones and suppresses neurite outgrowth, suggesting that CRMP2 is required for multipolar to bipolar transition for directional neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. Thus, our study reveals a novel mechanism that the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway controls neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth by suppressing the transcription of CRMP2."
https://openalex.org/W2030757483,"L-cysteine is ubiquitous in all living organisms and is involved in a variety of functions, including the synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters and glutathione and the regulation of the structure, stability, and catalysis of proteins. In the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amebiasis, L-cysteine plays an essential role in proliferation, adherence, and defense against oxidative stress; however, the essentiality of this amino acid in the pathways it regulates is not well understood. In the present study, we applied capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry to quantitate charged metabolites modulated in response to L-cysteine deprivation in E. histolytica, which was selected as a model for examining the biological roles of L-cysteine. L-cysteine deprivation had profound effects on glycolysis, amino acid, and phospholipid metabolism, with sharp decreases in the levels of L-cysteine, L-cystine, and S-adenosylmethionine and a dramatic accumulation of O-acetylserine and S-methylcysteine. We further demonstrated that S-methylcysteine is synthesized from methanethiol and O-acetylserine by cysteine synthase, which was previously considered to be involved in sulfur-assimilatory L-cysteine biosynthesis. In addition, L-cysteine depletion repressed glycolysis and energy generation, as it reduced acetyl-CoA, ethanol, and the major nucleotide di- and triphosphates, and led to the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates. Interestingly, L-cysteine depletion increased the synthesis of isopropanolamine and phosphatidylisopropanolamine, and it was confirmed that their increment was not a result of oxidative stress but was a specific response to L-cysteine depletion. We also identified a pathway in which isopropanolamine is synthesized from methylglyoxal via aminoacetone. To date, this study represents the first case where L-cysteine deprivation leads to drastic changes in core metabolic pathways, including energy, amino acid, and phospholipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2096386606,"PTPD1, a cytosolic non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase, stimulates the Src-EGF transduction pathway. Localization of PTPD1 at actin cytoskeleton and adhesion sites is required for cell scattering and migration. Here, we show that during EGF stimulation, PTPD1 is rapidly recruited to endocytic vesicles containing the EGF receptor. Endosomal localization of PTPD1 is mediated by interaction with KIF16B, an endosomal kinesin that modulates receptor recycling at the plasma membrane. Silencing of PTPD1 promotes degradation of EGF receptor and inhibits downstream ERK signaling. We also found that PTPD1 is markedly increased in bladder cancer tissue samples. PTPD1 levels positively correlated with the grading and invasiveness potential of these tumors. Transgenic expression of an inactive PTPD1 mutant or genetic knockdown of the endogenous PTPD1 severely inhibited both growth and motility of human bladder cancer cells. These findings identify PTPD1 as a novel component of the endocytic machinery that impacts on EGF receptor stability and on growth and motility of bladder cancer cells."

In contrast, TNF only activates classical NF-κB signaling and does not up-regulate CXCL12.

TNF did not inhibit the NC NF-κB pathway activation as LIGHT-induced p100 processing to p52 was intact; however, TNF either alone or together with LIGHT up-regulated p100 and RelB expression and induced the nuclear localization of p100-RelB complexes. Enhanced p100 and RelB expression was inhibited by IKKβK44M, which led us to question whether the IκB function of elevated p100 mediates the inhibition of CXCL12 expression by TNF. We retrovirally transduced HUVEC to express p100 at a level similar to that up-regulated by TNF; however, basal and LIGHT-induced CXCL12 expression was normal in the transduced cells. In contrast, ectopic RelB expression recapitulated the effects of TNF on NC signaling and inhibited basal and LIGHT-induced CXCL12 expression by HUVEC.

IntroductionAcinetobacter baumannii is an emerging pathogen that belongs to a relatively underexplored branch of γ-proteobacteria. It can cause severe pneumonia and infections of the urinary tract, bloodstream, and other parts of the body. Some isolates of A. baumannii display resistance to many known antibiotics (1Vila J.

Microbiol. 2007; 5: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar), emphasizing the importance of pursuing new therapeutic targets for drug development. Biogenesis of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NAD), an indispensable cofactor involved in a multitude of biochemical transformations in metabolic networks of all species, was recently established as a target pathway for the development of new antibiotics (3Vilchèze C.

Beyond its main function as a redox cofactor, NAD is consumed as a co-substrate by a number of nonredox enzymes such as bacterial DNA ligase and protein deacetylase of the CobB/Sir2 family (8Gazzaniga F. Stebbins R. Chang S.Z. McPeek M.A. Brenner C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9Sorci L. Kurnasov O. Rodionov D.A. Osterman A.L. Lew M. Hung-Wen L. Comprehensive Natural Products II. Elsevier, Oxford2010: 213-257Crossref Google Scholar). A degradative consumption of NAD by these and, likely, other (not fully elucidated) enzymes demands continuous replenishing of the NAD pool, providing further rationale for targeting essential enzymes involved in its biogenesis and recycling. Among these enzymes, nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NaMNAT) 4The abbreviations used are: NaMNATnicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferaseNaAD(P)nicotinate adenine dinucleotide (phosphate)NmnicotinamideNanicotinateNaMNnicotinate mononucleotideADPRADP-ribosePRPPphosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. of the NadD family and NAD synthetase of the NadE family are widely recognized as the most promising drug targets (6Osterman A.L.

Kurnasov O. Rodionov D.A. Osterman A.L. Lew M. Hung-Wen L. Comprehensive Natural Products II. Elsevier, Oxford2010: 213-257Crossref Google Scholar, 16Sorci L. Martynowski D. Rodionov D.A. Eyobo Y.

NadD and NadE enzymes together comprise a two-step conversion of the committed precursor nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) to NAD. Alternative de novo and salvage routes leading to NaMN synthesis converge at this nearly universal downstream pathway, explaining the conservation and essentiality of nadD and nadE genes. Nevertheless, a few groups of bacteria (including Acinetobacter spp.) appear to deviate from a common pattern lacking orthologs for one or both of these genes and pointing to the existence of alternative routes of NAD biogenesis as well as to the necessity of alternative targeting strategies. Thus, obligate intracellular pathogens Chlamydia and Rickettsia have lost the entire NAD biosynthetic machinery, replacing it by a unique capability to salvage NAD from the host cell (9Sorci L. Kurnasov O. Rodionov D.A. Osterman A.L. Lew M. Hung-Wen L. Comprehensive Natural Products II. Elsevier, Oxford2010: 213-257Crossref Google Scholar). Haemophilus influenzae lacking both nadD and nadE as well as most other common genes of NAD biosynthesis is entirely dependent on a relatively rare PnuC-NadR pathway of nicotinamide riboside (so-called V-factor) salvage (17Gerlach G. Reidl J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6719-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Another alternative route of NAD biosynthesis was recently discovered in Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia or rabbit fever (16Sorci L. Martynowski D. Rodionov D.A. Eyobo Y. Zogaj X. Klose K.E. Nikolaev E.V. Magni G. Zhang H. Osterman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3083-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this species lacking nadD, the NaMN intermediate is first amidated to NMN by NMN synthetase, a divergent member of the NadE family. In the second step, NMN is converted to NAD by NMNAT of the NadM family (16Sorci L. Martynowski D. Rodionov D.A. Eyobo Y. Zogaj X. Klose K.E. Nikolaev E.V. Magni G. Zhang H. Osterman A.L. Proc. Natl.

Members of this family, which also belongs to a large superfamily of HIGH nucleotidyltransferases (19Aravind L. Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 2002; 48: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), are commonly present in Archaea as a functional replacement of NadD (20Raffaelli N. Pisani F.M. Lorenzi T. Emanuelli M. Amici A. Ruggieri S. Magni G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7718-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are scarcely distributed in bacteria, typically as fusion proteins with ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase. In most cases they are present in addition to (rather than instead of) NadD in the context of a dispensable nicotinamide salvage/recycling pathway, which is initiated by the conversion of nicotinamide to NMN by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NMPRT) of the NadV family (21Gerdes S.Y. Kurnasov O.V. Shatalin K. Polanuyer B. Sloutsky R. Vonstein V. Overbeek R. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3012-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The recently established essential role of NadM in F. tularensis first highlighted this family as an alternative drug target in NAD biogenesis of bacterial pathogens. This choice is additionally supported by the fact that members of NadM family are only distantly homologous to their human counterparts (22Magni G. Di Stefano M. Orsomando G. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Curr. Med. Chem. 2009; 16: 1372-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).To evaluate the last enzymatic steps of NAD biosynthesis as antibacterial targets in A. baumannii, we combined bioinformatics with biochemical and genetic techniques to systematically analyze the complete NAD metabolic subnetwork in the non-pathogenic model organism Acinetobacter baylyi (previously called Acinetobacter sp.

However, the rational choice of actual drug targets requires better understanding of pathways that comprise NAD metabolic subnetworks, especially in divergent and poorly explored organisms such as pathogenic species of Acinetobacter. Indeed this study revealed that among the two nearly universal target enzymes, NadD and NadE, the former is functionally replaced in Acinetobacter by a member of a distinct NadM family, whereas the latter is potentially dispensable.Our approach to the reconstruction of NAD metabolism in Acinetobacter was based on comparative genomics analysis combined with focused experimental testing and refinement of the key bionformatics predictions. The bioinformatics analysis included all Acinetobacter species with completely sequenced genomes (7 genomes were publicly available), whereas the experimental testing was performed using a nonpathogenic strain, A. baylyi ADP1. This strain provided us with an ideal model system due to its remarkable genetic versatility (27Metzgar D. Bacher J.M. Pezo V. Reader J. Döring V. Schimmel P. Marlière P. de Crécy-Lagard V.

Weissenbach J. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2008; 4: 174Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Moreover, understanding of NAD metabolism in A. baylyi is of additional importance for its biotechnological applications in biodegradation and manufacturing of biopolymers (46Gutnick D.L. Bach H. Gerischer U. Acinetobacter Molecular Biology. Caister Academic Press, Norfolk, UK2008: 231-264Google Scholar). Indeed, maintenance and regeneration of the NAD cofactor pool is a known bottleneck in many microbial fermentations (47Verho R. Londesborough J. Penttilä M. Richard P. Appl. Environ.

Microbiology. 2002; 148: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In silico genomic reconstruction performed in this study revealed an extensive network of pathways leading to NAD, which is conserved in all analyzed Acinetobacter spp. and includes de novo synthesis and two alternative salvage/recycling routes (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This analysis pointed us to several unique and previously unexplored features, and targeted biochemical and genetic experiments were designed to test the key bioinformatics inferences and reconcile ambiguities and possible alternative scenarios.In the upstream part of Acinetobacter NAD subnetwork, the most unusual feature is the simultaneous presence of the two alternative (and potentially competing) Nm salvage routes, deamidating (via PncA-PncB) and nondeamidating (via NadV). A widely different phylogenomic distribution of these two alternative salvage pathways and possible evolutionary implications have been previously discussed (8Gazzaniga F. Stebbins R. Chang S.Z. McPeek M.A. Brenner C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Gerdes S.Y. Kurnasov O.V. Shatalin K. Polanuyer B. Sloutsky R. Vonstein V. Overbeek R. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3012-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and they are further illustrated in supplemental Table S4.Through in vitro characterization of all respective enzymes (Table 3) and growth phenotype analysis of engineered knock-out mutants (Table 2), we have confirmed that both salvage routes are operational in Acinetobacter. Indeed, each of them could support the normal growth of A. baylyi as a sole source of pyridine nucleotides on the minimal medium supplemented with Nm. Although the biological significance of this duality is not completely clear, some experimental data obtained here allow us to speculate that the first route is predominantly responsible for the salvage of exogenous Nm (as well as Na), especially when its concentration in the environment is very low (Table 2 and Fig. 2). On the other hand, the second, abNadV-mediated route is likely to contribute largely to the recycling of endogenous Nm, which may accumulate due to degradative utilization of NAD by CobB/Sir2 NAD-dependent protein deacetylase and, possibly, by other (yet unknown) NAD-glycohydrolases. Indirect evidence in favor of this interpretation was provided by the experimentally confirmed in vivo transcriptional regulation of nadV gene by ADPR-responsive repressor abNrtR. The ability of ADPR to disrupt binding of abNrtR to the predicted operator site in the upstream of prs-nadV operon was confirmed in vitro by EMSA analysis (Fig. 3). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that accumulation of ADPR resulting from NAD degradation may be interpreted by the cell as a signal to activate recycling of Nm. The latter is released as a byproduct of this degradation, and the abNadV-mediated nondeamidating route appears to be the most efficient way of its conversion to NAD with the help of NMNAT activity of abNadM (see below). Notably, the first gene of the prs-nadV operon encoding a paralog of PRPP synthetase may also directly contribute to Nm recycling by feeding PRPP as a second substrate for NadV reaction (Fig. 1). It is tempting to speculate that ribosyl 5-phosphate required for the synthesis of PRPP may be at least partially supplied by the hydrolysis of ADPR (supplemental Fig. S5) by the product of nudF gene (ACIAD0275 in A. baylyi) tentatively assigned an ADPR pyrophosphatase function based on homology with other characterized members of Nudix family (49McLennan A.G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).The remarkable plurality of the upstream pathways in the NAD subnetwork leading to the formation of pyridine nucleotide precursors (NaMN and NMN) emphasizes the importance of NAD biogenesis and homeostasis in Acinetobacter. At the same time, a demonstrated functional redundancy of these pathways (at least in laboratory conditions) argues that none of the respective enzymes would constitute a sustainable drug target. Moreover, of the two enzymes abNadM and abNadE involved in downstream conversion of these precursors to NAD, only the former is truly indispensable, as supported by combined genetic and kinetic evidences (TABLE 1, TABLE 2, TABLE 3). The abNadM is the first documented example of dual NMNAT/NaMNAT specificity among bacterial members of the NadM family. As noticed before, this family is only sparsely represented in bacteria where NadM is usually present in addition to (and not instead of) the housekeeping NadD enzyme and contributes to an optional Nm salvage/recycling together with NadV enzyme (21Gerdes S.Y. Kurnasov O.V. Shatalin K. Polanuyer B. Sloutsky R. Vonstein V. Overbeek R. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3012-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In most cases these two genes, nadV and nadM, are encoded in one operon. Importantly, all previously characterized bacterial NadM enzymes have two features distinguishing them from abNadM; (i) strong (at least 50–100-fold) substrate preference for NMN over NaMN and (ii) the presence of an additional C-terminal domain harboring ADPR pyrophosphatase of Nudix family. Both enzymatic activities are relevant for Nm salvage as discussed above for A. baylyi where the ADPR pyrophosphatase activity is encoded by a remotely located nudF gene. The structural and enzymatic analysis of the two representative bacterial NadM-NudF fusion proteins did not reveal any functional interactions between the two domains that would affect the NadM substrate preference (18Huang N. Sorci L. Zhang X. Brautigam C.A. Li X. Raffaelli N. Magni G. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. Structure. 2008; 16: 196-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At the same time, the NadM (and not NadD) family is universally present in nearly all Archaea where it appears to function as the housekeeping NaMNAT/NMNAT enzyme in NAD biogenesis.5 None of the analyzed archaeal genomes revealed a presence of the bacterial-like NadM-NudF fusion protein. These observations as well as characteristic variations in gene patterns associated with deamidating and nondeamidating Nm salvage/recycling routes point to a likely archaeal origin of bacterial NadM (see supplemental Table S4 and the accompanying comments suggesting a possible evolutionary scenario).Overall, the most important practical implication of this study is the identification of abNadM as an attractive target for the development of novel antibiotics against pathogenic strains of A. baumannii. This is the second case (after F. tularensis (16Sorci L. Martynowski D. Rodionov D.A. Eyobo Y. Zogaj X. Klose K.E. Nikolaev E.V. Magni G. Zhang H. Osterman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3083-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)) where a member of NadM family functionally replaces NadD (which is otherwise present in nearly all pathogenic bacteria) and constitutes an alternative drug target. In both cases, members of NadE family were shown to be dispensable (at least in laboratory conditions). The latter observation can be tentatively projected to some other bacterial species (including pathogenic strains of Burkholderia) containing the complete nondeamidating salvage pathway comprised of NMPRT (NadV family) and NMNAT (NadM or NadR family). More generally, it reflects a fundamental difference between the two types of biochemical transformations associated with the downstream pathways of NAD biosynthesis. At least one of the two adenylyl transferase reactions converting pyridine mononucleotides (NaMN or/and NMN) to respective dinucleotides (NaAD or/and NAD) is present and unconditionally essential in all life forms (including all bacterial pathogens) except for some intracellular endosymbionts. On the other hand, the ATP-dependent amidation of the carboxylate moiety of NaAD by NAD synthetase (or, rarely, of NaMN by NMN synthetase) in some species may be bypassed (as in Francisella) or even replaced (as in Haemophilus) by the nondeamidating salvage of amidated precursors (Nm or Nm-ribose, respectively). NAD metabolism of Acinetobacter analyzed in this study is another example that illustrates this fundamental principle providing important guidelines for drug targets selection and prioritization. IntroductionAcinetobacter baumannii is an emerging pathogen that belongs to a relatively underexplored branch of γ-proteobacteria. It can cause severe pneumonia and infections of the urinary tract, bloodstream, and other parts of the body. Some isolates of A. baumannii display resistance to many known antibiotics (1Vila J. Martí S. Sánchez-Céspedes J. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2007; 59: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 2Dijkshoorn L. Nemec A. Seifert H. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar), emphasizing the importance of pursuing new therapeutic targets for drug development. Biogenesis of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NAD), an indispensable cofactor involved in a multitude of biochemical transformations in metabolic networks of all species, was recently established as a target pathway for the development of new antibiotics (3Vilchèze C. Weinrick B. Wong K.W. Chen B. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Huang N. Kolhatkar R. Eyobo Y. Sorci L. Rodionova I. Osterman A.L.

Beyond its main function as a redox cofactor, NAD is consumed as a co-substrate by a number of nonredox enzymes such as bacterial DNA ligase and protein deacetylase of the CobB/Sir2 family (8Gazzaniga F. Stebbins R. Chang S.Z. McPeek M.A. Brenner C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9Sorci L. Kurnasov O. Rodionov D.A. Osterman A.L. Lew M. Hung-Wen L. Comprehensive Natural Products II. Elsevier, Oxford2010: 213-257Crossref Google Scholar). A degradative consumption of NAD by these and, likely, other (not fully elucidated) enzymes demands continuous replenishing of the NAD pool, providing further rationale for targeting essential enzymes involved in its biogenesis and recycling. Among these enzymes, nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NaMNAT) 4The abbreviations used are: NaMNATnicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferaseNaAD(P)nicotinate adenine dinucleotide (phosphate)NmnicotinamideNanicotinateNaMNnicotinate mononucleotideADPRADP-ribosePRPPphosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. of the NadD family and NAD synthetase of the NadE family are widely recognized as the most promising drug targets (6Osterman A.L.

Vassieva O. Ye Y. Zagnitko O. Vonstein V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5691-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar)) confirmed that these two enzymes are conserved in the overwhelming majority of >800 diverse bacterial species with completely sequenced genomes (9Sorci L. Kurnasov O. Rodionov D.A. Osterman A.L. Lew M. Hung-Wen L. Comprehensive Natural Products II. Elsevier, Oxford2010: 213-257Crossref Google Scholar, 16Sorci L. Martynowski D. Rodionov D.A. Eyobo Y.

NadD and NadE enzymes together comprise a two-step conversion of the committed precursor nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) to NAD. Alternative de novo and salvage routes leading to NaMN synthesis converge at this nearly universal downstream pathway, explaining the conservation and essentiality of nadD and nadE genes. Nevertheless, a few groups of bacteria (including Acinetobacter spp.) appear to deviate from a common pattern lacking orthologs for one or both of these genes and pointing to the existence of alternative routes of NAD biogenesis as well as to the necessity of alternative targeting strategies. Thus, obligate intracellular pathogens Chlamydia and Rickettsia have lost the entire NAD biosynthetic machinery, replacing it by a unique capability to salvage NAD from the host cell (9Sorci L. Kurnasov O. Rodionov D.A. Osterman A.L. Lew M. Hung-Wen L. Comprehensive Natural Products II. Elsevier, Oxford2010: 213-257Crossref Google Scholar). Haemophilus influenzae lacking both nadD and nadE as well as most other common genes of NAD biosynthesis is entirely dependent on a relatively rare PnuC-NadR pathway of nicotinamide riboside (so-called V-factor) salvage (17Gerlach G. Reidl J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6719-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Another alternative route of NAD biosynthesis was recently discovered in Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia or rabbit fever (16Sorci L. Martynowski D. Rodionov D.A. Eyobo Y. Zogaj X. Klose K.E. Nikolaev E.V. Magni G. Zhang H. Osterman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3083-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this species lacking nadD, the NaMN intermediate is first amidated to NMN by NMN synthetase, a divergent member of the NadE family. In the second step, NMN is converted to NAD by NMNAT of the NadM family (16Sorci L. Martynowski D. Rodionov D.A. Eyobo Y. Zogaj X. Klose K.E. Nikolaev E.V. Magni G. Zhang H. Osterman A.L. Proc. Natl.

Members of this family, which also belongs to a large superfamily of HIGH nucleotidyltransferases (19Aravind L. Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 2002; 48: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), are commonly present in Archaea as a functional replacement of NadD (20Raffaelli N. Pisani F.M. Lorenzi T. Emanuelli M. Amici A. Ruggieri S. Magni G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7718-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are scarcely distributed in bacteria, typically as fusion proteins with ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase. In most cases they are present in addition to (rather than instead of) NadD in the context of a dispensable nicotinamide salvage/recycling pathway, which is initiated by the conversion of nicotinamide to NMN by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NMPRT) of the NadV family (21Gerdes S.Y. Kurnasov O.V. Shatalin K. Polanuyer B. Sloutsky R. Vonstein V. Overbeek R. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3012-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The recently established essential role of NadM in F. tularensis first highlighted this family as an alternative drug target in NAD biogenesis of bacterial pathogens. This choice is additionally supported by the fact that members of NadM family are only distantly homologous to their human counterparts (22Magni G. Di Stefano M. Orsomando G. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Curr. Med. Chem. 2009; 16: 1372-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).To evaluate the last enzymatic steps of NAD biosynthesis as antibacterial targets in A. baumannii, we combined bioinformatics with biochemical and genetic techniques to systematically analyze the complete NAD metabolic subnetwork in the non-pathogenic model organism Acinetobacter baylyi (previously called Acinetobacter sp.

https://openalex.org/W2085595192,"Thus far, the role of the Escherichia coli signal recognition particle (SRP) has only been studied using targeted approaches. It has been shown for a handful of cytoplasmic membrane proteins that their insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane is at least partially SRP-dependent. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the SRP plays a role in preventing toxic accumulation of mistargeted cytoplasmic membrane proteins in the cytoplasm. To complement the targeted studies on SRP, we have studied the consequences of the depletion of the SRP component Fifty-four homologue (Ffh) in E. coli using a global approach. The steady-state proteomes and the proteome dynamics were evaluated using one- and two-dimensional gel analysis, followed by mass spectrometry-based protein identification and immunoblotting. Our analysis showed that depletion of Ffh led to the following: (i) impaired kinetics of the biogenesis of the cytoplasmic membrane proteome; (ii) lowered steady-state levels of the respiratory complexes NADH dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and cytochrome bo(3) oxidase and lowered oxygen consumption rates; (iii) increased levels of the chaperones DnaK and GroEL at the cytoplasmic membrane; (iv) a σ(32) stress response and protein aggregation in the cytoplasm; and (v) impaired protein synthesis. Our study shows that in E. coli SRP-mediated protein targeting is directly linked to maintaining protein homeostasis and the general fitness of the cell."

Based on the architecture of their catalytic sites, the 20 aaRSs can be classified into two groups (1Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Class I aaRSs have “HIGH” and “KMSKS” signature sequences located in the Rossmann fold active site. Class II aaRSs are characterized by three homologous motifs (1Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Usually, the reaction catalyzed by aaRSs occurs in two steps: amino acid activation followed by aminoacylation of the cognate tRNA. The amino acid activation of aaRSs does not require the presence of the cognate tRNA except for arginyl-tRNA synthetase (ArgRS), glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS), and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS), which activate their cognate amino acids in a tRNA-dependent manner (2Mehler A.H.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic ArgRS (yArgRS) is a monomeric protein with five domains: the N-terminal additional domain (Add1), the catalytic domain including two insertion domains (Ins-1 and Ins-2), and the C-terminal additional domain (Add2). The tRNAArg serves as the activator of ArgRS in the reaction of amino acid activation and as the substrate in aminoacylation. Three regions of ArgRS are involved in recognizing tRNAArg: the active center, the anticodon-binding domain, and the Add1 domain. The recognition of tRNAArg by the three regions is essential for activation of mammalian ArgRS (7Lazard M. Agou F. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Guigou L. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16540-16548Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The Add1 domain, containing a two-layer α/β unit, is unique because it is missing in other class I aaRSs, and it is involved in arginine activation by interacting with the D-loop of tRNAArg (4Delagoutte B. Moras D. Cavarelli J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5599-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Two forms of ArgRS exist in the mammalian cytoplasm. One form is a component of the multiple synthetase complex (MSC), playing a critical role in protein translation, and the other exists free in the cytoplasm with the N-terminal 72 amino acids truncated (ΔNhcArgRS) (9Deutscher M.P. Ni R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6003-6006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both forms of ArgRS exhibit similar catalytic characteristics in vitro (10Vellekamp G. Sihag R.K.

Compared with the free enzyme, mammalian ArgRS in MSC has an extended N terminus and interacts with other components of MSC. Guigou et al. (11Guigou L. Shalak V. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4592-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reported that hamster ArgRS with a 73-amino acid extension at its N terminus interacts with the p43 factor in MSC. Ling et al. (12Ling C. Yao Y.N. Zheng Y.G. Wei H. Wang L. Wu X.F. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34755-34763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in our laboratory demonstrated that human cytoplasmic ArgRS (hcArgRS) with an N-terminal 72-amino acid extension binds to the C-terminal domain of human cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) in MSC. Our previous investigations have shown that both forms of hcArgRS are produced from two translational initiations of a single mRNA (13Zheng Y.G. Wei H. Ling C. Xu M.G. Wang E.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1338-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The hcArgRS in MSC is essential for normal protein synthesis (14Kyriacou S.V. Deutscher M.P. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 419-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to the critical role in protein synthesis, ArgRS also participates in the ubiquitin-dependent “N-end rule” pathway of protein degradation by providing Arg-tRNAArg as a substrate for arginyl-tRNA transferase (ATE1) (15Ferber S. Ciechanover A. Nature. 1987; 326: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the free form of ArgRS is probably responsible for protein arginylation and degradation (16Sivaram P. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 3665-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that the N-end rule pathway is a sensor of heme, and several key proteins in the pathway are regulated by heme (17Hu R.G. Wang H. Xia Z. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ArgRS is also a component protein of the N-end rule pathway, so we ask whether heme interacts with ArgRS. Heme is a protoporphyrin IX derivative containing an iron atom in the center in either the reduced ferrous (heme) or the oxidized ferric state (hemin). When heme binds to protein, a cysteine or histidine residue usually serves as the axial ligand of heme by coordinating the iron center of heme (18Hou S. Reynolds M.F. Horrigan F.T. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Acc. Chem. Res. 2006; 39: 918-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Heme absorbs in the ultraviolet-visible region, and the absorption peak around 400 nm is known as the Soret band. The Soret band results from Π-Π* transition of the porphyrin ring. Binding of heme to proteins may change the energetic gap of the Π-Π* transition, which shifts the Soret band to shorter or longer wavelengths (19Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Heme participates in oxygen and carbon dioxide transport, electron transfer, and other biological functions by behaving as a cofactor for proteins such as hemoglobin, cytochrome c, etc. (20Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence shows that heme plays other important roles by working as an active signal molecule (21Mense S.M. Zhang L. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) kinase (HRI) regulates the initiation of protein biosynthesis in eukaryotic cells, and the activity of the kinase is regulated by heme binding (22Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 23Igarashi J. Murase M. Iizuka A. Pichierri F. Martinkova M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18782-18791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Heme induces polyubiquitination and degradation of some heme sensor proteins, implying that heme may be another class of molecular signature for recognition by an E3 ubiquitin ligase (17Hu R.G.

Heme is also involved in processing of microRNAs by promoting dimerization of DGCR8 (28Faller M. Matsunaga M. Yin S. Loo J.A. Guo F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) and GluRS bind to and are regulated by heme (29Wakasugi K.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3135-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which prompted us to investigate the effects of heme on another aaRS, human cytoplasmic ArgRS. In the present work, we showed that both forms of hcArgRS could bind hemin in vitro and that hemin specifically bound to the Add1 domain of hcArgRS by an axial ligand, Cys-115, a conserved residue in eukaryotic ArgRSs. Hemin also induced oligomerization of hcArgRS and inhibited the catalytic activity of hcArgRS. Our results suggest that hcArgRS might be regulated by hemin in the N-end rule pathway in human cells. Hemin, hemin-agarose, l-arginine, dithiothreitol, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, ATP, Tris-HCl, magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), and activated charcoal were purchased from Sigma. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) Superflow was purchased from Qiagen Inc. l-[3H]Arginine, tetrasodium [32P]pyrophosphate, Superose-12 column, Superdex-75 column, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Escherichia coli tRNAArg(ACG) with an accepting activity of 1200 pmol/A260 was isolated from an E. coli strain overproducing the tRNA constructed in our laboratory as described previously (31Liu M. Huang Y. Wu J. Wang E. Wang Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11006-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Hemin solution was freshly prepared in 0.1 m NaOH and then diluted into the appropriate buffer. Stock solutions were kept on ice in the dark until use. The concentration of hemin was determined at 385 nm using an extinction coefficient of 5.84 × 104 cm−1 m−1. pMFT7H6-hcArgRS was constructed by inserting the full-length hcArgRS gene into the gap between NcoI and BamH1 of vector pMFT7H6, which was constructed previously in our laboratory (32Chen J. Li Y. Wang E. Wang Y. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). ΔNhcArgRS was constructed by Ling et al. (12Ling C. Yao Y.N. Zheng Y.G. Wei H. Wang L. Wu X.F. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34755-34763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in our laboratory. E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL was transformed with the two plasmids, pMFT7H6-hcArgRS and pET15-ΔNhcArgRS, to produce N-terminal His6-tagged hcArgRS and ΔNhcArgRS, respectively. The transformants containing each plasmid were grown at 37 °C to reach an A600 of 0.6 in 500 ml of 2× YT medium (16 g/liter Trypton, 10 g/liter Yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 60 μg/ml chloramphenicol and were induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 200 μm. After a 5-h induction at 22 °C, the cells were harvested and suspended in buffer A (10 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm, β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0)). After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant was gently mixed with 1.0 ml of Ni2+-NTA Superflow resin for 1 h. The mixture was loaded on a minicolumn for gravity flow chromatography. The resin was washed with 25 ml of buffer B (except for 20 mm imidazole, other components were as for buffer A) to remove nonspecifically bound contaminants. Then the enzyme was eluted with 10 ml of buffer C (except for 250 mm imidazole, other components were as for buffer A). The eluted His6-hcArgRS or -ΔNhcArgRS fractions were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 100 mm NaCl and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 filter (Millipore). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the protocol provided by the KOD-Plus mutagenesis kit (Toyobo), and the mutants were purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The purified enzymes had over 95% purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) assay. ArgRSs from E. coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus were purified as described previously by our laboratory (31Liu M. Huang Y. Wu J. Wang E. Wang Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11006-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34Li J. Yao Y.N. Liu M.F. Wang E.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 773-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene of ArgRS from S. cerevisiae was a gift from Dr. Eriani (Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, CNRS). The gene was inserted into the gap between NcoI and SalI of vector pMFT7H6 to produce the plasmid pMFT7H6-yArgRS and expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL. yArgRS was purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-NTA column as described above. The three purified ArgRSs were over 95% homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Alignment of ArgRS sequences shows that the Add1 domain of ΔNhcArgRS is equivalent to that of yArgRS. A DNA fragment encoding 110 amino acid residues of the N terminus of ΔNhcArgRS linked to a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag was inserted into pGEX-4T-1 between BamHI and EcoRI sites to produce the pGEX-Add1 recombinant plasmid. The BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL E. coli cells harboring the plasmid were grown at 37 °C to reach an A600 of 0.6 and induced by 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After incubation at 16 °C for 12 h, the E. coli transformant cells were harvested, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer containing PMSF, and lysed completely on ice using a sonicator. By ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h, cell debris were removed, and supernatant was mixed with appropriate amounts of GST-Sepharose 4B beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was loaded onto a minicolumn for gravity flow chromatography, and the resin was washed with PBS. Thrombin was incubated with the resin in PBS for 16 h at 22 °C to cleave the Add1 domain from the GST-Add1 fusion protein. The isolated Add1 domain was harvested and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter. ΔNhcArgRS preincubated with hemin at a molar ratio of 1:1 was applied to a Superose-12 column for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min by using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl. UV light-absorbing fractions that contained ΔNhcArgRS were collected and concentrated with an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter. A Superdex-75 column was used for HPLC analysis of the isolated Add1 domain. The same assay without hemin was performed as a control. Alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), BSA (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and α-lactalbumin(14 kDa) were used as protein markers to calculate the relative molecular masses of protein oligomers. The absorption spectrum properties of hemin were determined by recording the absorption spectra of hemin in the absence or presence of proteins (ΔNhcArgRS, the Add1 domain, and mutants) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 100 mm NaCl. The molar ratio of hemin to proteins was 1:1. The spectra were recorded between 200 and 600 nm on a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). 50 μm hemin was incubated with ΔNhcArgRS at various concentrations from 0 to 90 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 100 mm NaCl. After a 1-h incubation in the dark at room temperature, the absorption at 420 nm was measured. ΔA420 was obtained by subtracting the absorbance of hemin in the absence of protein. The data were fit to the equation Y = Bmax × X/(Kd + X) using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. Bmax refers to the maximum specific binding in the same units as Y, and Kd is the equilibrium binding constant in the same units as X. ΔNhcArgRS was mixed with hemin (molar ratio, 1:1), incubated on ice for 30 min in the dark, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a loading buffer without a reducing agent. After SDS-PAGE, the gel was washed with deionized water, and Super Signal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) was sprayed onto the gel for 30 s. An image was acquired using a Fujifilm LAS-4000 System configured for chemiluminescence. ΔNhcArgRS alone without hemin served as a control. 100 μg of hcArgRS or ΔNhcArgRS was dissolved in binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 80 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 m NaCl. 20 μl of hemin-agarose beads were equilibrated with the same buffer and incubated with the protein solutions for 2 h at 4 °C in a rotator. The mixture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 1 min, and the agarose pellets were washed three times with binding buffer to remove unbound material. Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used as a control to rule out nonspecific interactions between the protein and agarose. Hemin-agarose and Sepharose beads were then treated with 2× SDS loading buffer (containing 50 mm DTT) and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. The mixture was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins on the gel were visualized by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibody for ΔNhcArgRS. Cysteine residues on the protein surface of ΔNhcArgRS were determined using DTNB according to the method described previously (31Liu M. Huang Y. Wu J. Wang E. Wang Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11006-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed at 25 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 μm enzyme and 2 mm DTNB. The change in absorbance at 412 nm was recorded, and total SH content was calculated assuming a molar absorption coefficient of 14,150. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. The aminoacylation activity of ArgRS was determined at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 12 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml BSA, 20 μm isolated E. coli tRNAArg(ACG), 20 μm [3H]arginine (450 cpm/pmol), and 3 nm ΔNhcArgRS in the absence or presence of hemin at various concentrations. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the reaction was initiated by adding 4 mm ATP. The kinetic constants of enzymes were determined using various concentrations of the relevant substrates in the reaction mixture in the absence or presence of 10 μm hemin. The data were analyzed by Hyper1.1 software. The effects of hemin on the activity of amino acid activation were determined by assaying the rate of ATP-PPi exchange in the absence or presence of 10 μm hemin at 37 °C. The reaction was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 12 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml BSA, 20 μm E. coli tRNAArg, 2 mm arginine, 2 mm tetrasodium [32P]pyrophosphate (10 cpm/pmol), and 3 nm ΔNhcArgRS. HcArgRS and ΔNhcArgRS were purified from E. coli BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL transformants by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. Although both hcArgRSs could be obtained from overproducing E. coli strains, ΔNhcArgRS was much easier to purify than the full-length hcArgRS. The differences of primary sequences and enzymatic characteristics between hcArgRS and ΔNhcArgRS were slight except for the 72 amino acid residues at the N terminus (10Vellekamp G. Sihag R.K. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9843-9847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ling C. Yao Y.N. Zheng Y.G. Wei H. Wang L. Wu X.F. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34755-34763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and therefore, ΔNhcArgRS was mainly used in this work. Hemin is a protoporphyrin containing a ferric iron in the center, and we tested whether hemin could interact with ΔNhcArgRS in vitro. We incubated ΔNhcArgRS and hemin at a molar ratio of 1:1 and performed gel filtration to remove unbound molecules. The concentrated ΔNhcArgRS after incubation with hemin presented a red color, suggesting hemin bound to the protein; however, ΔNhcArgRS without hemin did not show an obvious color (Fig. 1A). Soret band shift is a sensitive method to detect interaction between heme/hemin and proteins (19Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Here the UV-visible absorption of ΔNhcArgRS bound with hemin after gel filtration exhibited obvious hyperchromic and bathochromic effects (Fig. 1B). The absorption peak of the Soret band of hemin was shifted from 385 to 420 nm, which is a typical spectrum of hemin-binding protein. Full-length hcArgRS showed spectral characteristics similar to those of ΔNhcArgRS in the presence of hemin (data not shown). A novel direct chemiluminescence (CL) imaging method has been developed for the detection of hemin-binding proteins in polyacrylamide gels. The method is based on the fact that metalloporphyrins can bind to proteins and catalyze the CL reaction of the luminol-H2O2 system (35Liu X. Huang L. Baeyens W.R. Ouyang J. He D. Wan G. Zhang L. Electrophoresis. 2009; 30: 3034-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The band corresponding to ΔNhcArgRS was observed in a gel by direct CL imaging for the protein incubated with hemin, suggesting that hemin formed a complex with the enzyme (Fig. 1C). The result of hemin-agarose affinity chromatography also showed that ΔNhcArgRS/hcArgRS could be pulled down by hemin-agarose (Fig. 1D) but could not bind to the control Sepharose beads (data not shown). These data indicated that hemin formed a stable complex with ΔNhcArgRS or hcArgRS. To test whether heme (ferrous protoporphyrin IX) also binds to ΔNhcArgRS, 2 mm dithionite was added to the complex of the enzyme and hemin to reduce hemin to Fe2+-heme, and the absorption spectra were recorded. The peak site of the Soret band was red-shifted to a longer wavelength around 430 nm, which is a characteristic of a heme-binding protein (data not shown). It is well documented that the heme regulatory motif is usually involved in heme binding by a conserved Cys-Pro dipeptide found in some heme-responsive proteins (23Igarashi J. Murase M. Iizuka A.

The majority of known heme-protein interactions are mediated by coordination bonds between the heme center and the SH group of Cys or side chain of His (23Igarashi J. Murase M. Iizuka A. Pichierri F.

There are a total of 14 Cys residues (three at the N terminus) and 12 His residues (one at the N terminus) in full-length hcArgRS. To determine the axial ligand of hemin in hcArgRS, we mutated each cysteine and histidine residue to alanine (single or double site mutant) and purified the mutants. Because WT hcArgRS/ΔNhcArgRS with hemin exhibited a typical absorption peak of the Soret band around 420 nm, the absorption spectra of these mutants with hemin were all measured. All mutants had spectral characteristics similar to those of hcArgRS with the Soret peak around 420 nm except for hcArgRS-C115A (Table 1). The Soret peak of hcArgRS-C115A with hemin at 420 nm disappeared completely as shown in Fig. 2A, suggesting that Cys-115 may serve as the axial ligand for hemin. When Cys-115 was changed to Ser to construct another mutant, C115S, the Soret peak at 420 nm for C115S with hemin was also not observed (data not shown). These data indicated that Cys-115 of hcArgRS is crucial to its binding with hemin. DTNB titration was performed to determine whether the thiol group of Cys-115 is located on the protein surface (Fig. 2B). Seven SH groups were modified by DTNB for ΔNhcArgRS, and six thiol groups were titrated by DTNB for ΔNhcArgRS-C115A, suggesting that Cys-115 is located at the protein surface under these experimental conditions. Generally, hemin interacts with the surface thiol group of a protei"
https://openalex.org/W2051030073,"The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) confers protection against oxidative stress by supplying NADPH necessary for the regeneration of glutathione, which detoxifies H2O2 into H2O and O2. RPE functions in the PPP, catalyzing the reversible conversion of D-ribulose 5-phosphate to D-xylulose 5-phosphate and is an important enzyme for cellular response against oxidative stress. Here, using structural, biochemical, and functional studies, we show that human D-ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase (hRPE) uses Fe2+ for catalysis. Structures of the binary complexes of hRPE with D-ribulose 5-phosphate and D-xylulose 5-phosphate provide the first detailed molecular insights into the binding mode of physiological ligands and reveal an octa-hedrally coordinated Fe2+ ion buried deep inside the active site. Human RPE folds into a typical (β/α)g triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel with a loop regulating access to the active site. Two aspartic acids are well positioned to carry out the proton transfers in an acid-base type of reaction mechanism. Interestingly, mutating Ser-10 to alanine almost abolished the enzymatic activity, while L12A and M72A mutations resulted in an almost 50% decrease in the activity. The binary complexes of hRPE reported here will aid in the design of small molecules for modulating the activity of the enzyme and altering flux through the PPP.—Liang, W., Ouyang, S., Shaw, N., Joachimiak, A., Zhang, R., Liu, Z-J.

https://openalex.org/W1989969748,"Fundamental knowledge about how G protein-coupled receptors and their ligands interact is important for understanding receptor-ligand binding and the development of new drug discovery strategies. We have used cross-linking and tandem mass spectrometry analyses to investigate the interaction of the N terminus of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tridecapeptide pheromone, α-factor (WHWLQLKPGQPMY), and Ste2p, its cognate G protein-coupled receptor. The Trp(1) residue of α-factor was replaced by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) for periodate-mediated chemical cross-linking, and biotin was conjugated to Lys(7) for detection purposes to create the peptide [DOPA(1),Lys(7)(BioACA),Nle(12)]α-factor, called Bio-DOPA(1)-α-factor. This ligand analog was a potent agonist and bound to Ste2p with ∼65 nanomolar affinity. Immunoblot analysis of purified Ste2p samples that were treated with Bio-DOPA(1)-α-factor showed that the peptide analog cross-linked efficiently to Ste2p. The cross-linking was inhibited by the presence of either native α-factor or an α-factor antagonist. MALDI-TOF and immunoblot analyses revealed that Bio-DOPA(1)-α-factor cross-linked to a fragment of Ste2p encompassing residues Ser(251)-Met(294). Fragmentation of the cross-linked fragment and Ste2p using tandem mass spectrometry pinpointed the cross-link point of the DOPA(1) of the α-factor analog to the Ste2p Lys(269) side chain near the extracellular surface of the TM6-TM7 bundle. This conclusion was confirmed by a greatly diminished cross-linking of Bio-DOPA(1)-α-factor into a Ste2p(K269A) mutant. Based on these and previously obtained binding contact data, a mechanism of α-factor binding to Ste2p is proposed. The model for bound α-factor shows how ligand binding leads to conformational changes resulting in receptor activation of the signal transduction pathway."

Instead, we identified a gene, YALIOD10923g, encoding a protein containing two Myb domains, exhibiting a high degree of similarity to the Myb domain of human telomeric proteins TRF1 and TRF2 and homologous to an essential fission yeast protein Mug152 whose expression is elevated during meiosis. The protein, which we named Tay1p (telomere-associated in Yarrowia lipolytica 1), was purified for biochemical studies. Using a model Y. lipolytica telomere, we demonstrate that the protein preferentially binds to Y. lipolytica telomeric tracts. Tay1p binds along the telomeric tract as dimers and larger oligomers, and it is able to remodel the telomeric DNA into both looped structures and synaptic complexes of two model telomere DNAs. The ability of Tay1p to induce dimerization of telomeres in vitro goes in line with its oligomeric nature, where each oligomer can employ several Myb domains to form intermolecular telomere clusters. We also provide experimental evidence that Tay1p may be associated with Y. lipolytica telomeres in vivo. Together with its homologues from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and several basidiomycetous fungi (Sánchez-Alonso, P., and Guzman, P. (2008) Fungal Genet. Biol. 45, S54-S62), Tay1p constitutes a novel family of putative telomeric factors whose analysis may be instrumental in understanding the function and evolution of double-stranded DNA telomeric proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2037893265,"Replication fork protection complex Swi1-Swi3 and replication checkpoint mediator Mrc1 are required for maintenance of replication fork integrity during the course of DNA replication in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These proteins play crucial roles in stabilizing stalled forks and activating replication checkpoint signaling pathways. Although they are conserved replication fork components, precise biochemical roles of these proteins are not known. Here we purified Mrc1 and Swi1-Swi3 proteins and show that these proteins bind to DNA independently but synergistically in vitro. Mrc1 binds preferentially to arrested fork or D-loop-like structures, although the affinity is relatively low, whereas the Swi1-Swi3 complex binds to double-stranded DNA with higher affinity. In the presence of a low concentration of Swi1-Swi3, Mrc1 generates a novel ternary complex and binds to various types of DNA with higher affinity. Moreover, purified Mrc1 and Swi1-Swi3 physically interact with each other, and this interaction is lost by mutations in the known DNA binding domain of Mrc1 (K235E,K236E). The interaction is also lost in a mutant form of Swi1 (E662K) that is specifically defective in polar fork arrest at a site called RTS1 and causes sensitivity to genotoxic agents, although the DNA binding affinity of Swi1-Swi3 is not affected by this mutation. As expected, the synergistic effect of the Swi1-Swi3 on DNA binding of Mrc1 is also lost by these mutations affecting the interaction between Mrc1 and Swi1-Swi3. Our results reveal an aspect of molecular interactions that may play an important role in replication pausing and fork stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2054847485,"The Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle is responsible for carbon dioxide fixation in all plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. The enzyme that catalyzes the carbon dioxide-fixing reaction is ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Rubisco from a hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis (Tk-Rubisco) belongs to the type III group, and shows high activity at high temperatures. We have previously found that replacement of the entire α-helix 6 of Tk-Rubisco with the corresponding region of the spinach enzyme (SP6 mutant) results in an improvement of catalytic performance at mesophilic temperatures, both in vivo and in vitro, whereas the former and latter half-replacements of the α-helix 6 (SP4 and SP5 mutants) do not yield such improvement. We report here the crystal structures of the wild-type Tk-Rubisco and the mutants SP4 and SP6, and discuss the relationships between their structures and enzymatic activities. A comparison among these structures shows the movement and the increase of temperature factors of α-helix 6 induced by four essential factors. We thus supposed that an increase in the flexibility of the α-helix 6 and loop 6 regions was important to increase the catalytic activity of Tk-Rubisco at ambient temperatures. Based on this structural information, we constructed a new mutant, SP5-V330T, which was designed to have significantly greater flexibility in the above region, and it proved to exhibit the highest activity among all mutants examined to date. The thermostability of the SP5-V330T mutant was lower than that of wild-type Tk-Rubisco, providing further support on the relationship between flexibility and activity at ambient temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2065635960,"Crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) and related peptides are multifunctional regulatory neurohormones found in invertebrates. We isolated a CCAP-related peptide (conoCAP-a, for cone snail CardioActive Peptide) and cloned the cDNA of its precursor from venom of Conus villepinii. The precursor of conoCAP-a encodes for two additional CCAP-like peptides: conoCAP-b and conoCAP-c. This multi-peptide precursor organization is analogous to recently predicted molluscan CCAP-like preprohormones, and suggests a mechanism for the generation of biological diversification without gene amplification. While arthropod CCAP is a cardio-accelerator, we found that conoCAP-a decreases the heart frequency in Drosophila larvae, demonstrating that conoCAP-a and CCAP have opposite effects. Intravenous injection of conoCAP-a in rats caused decreased heart frequency and blood pressure in contrast to the injection of CCAP, which did not elicit any cardiac effect. Perfusion of rat ventricular cardiac myocytes with conoCAP-a decreased systolic calcium, indicating that conoCAP-a cardiac negative inotropic effects might be mediated via impairment of intracellular calcium trafficking. The contrasting cardiac effects of conoCAP-a and CCAP indicate that molluscan CCAP-like peptides have functions that differ from those of their arthropod counterparts. Molluscan CCAP-like peptides sequences, while homologous, differ between taxa and have unique sequences within a species. This relates to the functional hypervariability of these peptides as structure activity relationship studies demonstrate that single amino acids variations strongly affect cardiac activity. The discovery of conoCAPs in cone snail venom emphasizes the significance of their gene plasticity to have mutations as an adaptive evolution in terms of structure, cellular site of expression, and physiological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2060792903,"Voltage-gated ion channels are transmembrane proteins that undergo complex conformational changes during their gating transitions. Both functional and structural data from K+ channels suggest that extracellular and intracellular parts of the pore communicate with each other via a trajectory of interacting amino acids. No crystal structures are available for voltage-gated Na+ channels, but functional data suggest a similar intramolecular communication involving the inner and outer vestibules. However, the mechanism of such communication is unknown. Here, we report that amino acid Ile-1575 in the middle of transmembrane segment 6 of domain IV (DIV-S6) in the adult rat skeletal muscle isoform of the voltage-gated sodium channel (rNaV1.4) may act as molecular switch allowing for interaction between outer and inner vestibules. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis of the internal part of DIV-S6 revealed that only mutations at site 1575 rescued the channel from a unique kinetic state (“ultra-slow inactivation,” IUS) produced by the mutation K1237E in the selectivity filter. A similar effect was seen with I1575A. Previously, we reported that conformational changes of both the internal and the external vestibule are involved in the generation of IUS. The fact that mutations at site 1575 modulate IUS produced by K1237E strongly suggests an interaction between these sites.

Furthermore, these functional data define the position of the selectivity filter relative to the adjacent DIV-S6 segment within the ionic permeation pathway. Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that regulate the flow of ions across the cell membrane. This process is central to the modulation of cell excitability and to the transduction of signals across the membrane. Currently crystal structures of the voltage-gated Na+ channel are not available; however, the general topology of these proteins is believed to be homologous to published crystal structures of K+ channels. The common motif of these ion channels includes four subunits or domains arranged symmetrically around the central ion-conducting pore. Each subunit or domain contains at least two transmembrane α-helices separated by a membrane re-entrant loop (P-loop) incorporating the selectivity filter (outer vestibule). The four inner α-helices corresponding to the S6 segments in voltage-gated Na+ channels form the central pore (inner vestibule) and contain the activation gate. The segment of the P-loop immediately N-terminal to the selectivity filter forms an α-helix (“pore helix”) that is in close proximity to the inner pore-lining α-helix (1Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8161-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The transmembrane activity of ion channels requires some form of intramolecular communication between the extracellular (i.e. the outer vestibule) and intracellular parts. A number of functional studies in voltage-gated K+ channels suggest an interaction between the pore-lining α-helices of the internal vestibule and the P-loop region of the external vestibule (3Yifrach O.

Nature. 2010; 466: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) solved the structure of the bacterial KcsA channel in different open conformations corresponding to varying states in the activation-inactivation pathway. Analysis of these structures suggested that residue Phe-103 in the inner pore-lining helix interacts with the C-terminal end of the pore helix resulting in a structural change that leads to a non-conductive conformation of the selectivity filter (8Cuello L.G. Jogini V. Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Nature. 2010; 466: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 9Cuello L.G. Jogini V. Cortes D.M. Pan A.C. Gagnon D.G. Dalmas O. Cordero-Morales J.F. Chakrapani S. Roux B. Perozo E. Nature. 2010; 466: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These structural data for the first time confirmed that in K+ channels some forms of inactivation encompass an interaction between the outer vestibule (P-loops) and the inner helices (corresponding to the S6 segment of voltage-gated Na+ channels). Although evolutionally related to K+ channels, the predicted structure of Na+ channels differs in important aspects from the K+ channel structure. For example, the tetrameric arrangement of separate subunits in K+ channels is replaced by a four-domain composition of a single chain in Na+ channels. Furthermore, amino acids of the P-loops are proposed to direct their side chains towards the permeation pathway in Na+ channels, whereas these side chains point away from the pore in the K+ channel crystal structures (2Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8161-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is likely that these structural variations between K+ channels and Na+ channels affect their mode of intraprotein transmembrane communication. A published homology model of the voltage-gated Na+ channel, based on the crystal backbone structure of the KcsA K+ channel, suggests a close spatial relationship between the base of the P-loops forming the selectivity filter and the S6 segments lining the internal vestibule (2Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8161-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We wondered whether, as in K+ channels, the selectivity filter and the inner helices (S6 segments) are part of an intramolecular signal transduction pathway allowing for transmembrane communication. For this purpose we exploited a very specific protein conformation of the rNaV1.4 Na+ channel that we refer to as ultra-slow inactivation (IUS (10Todt H. Dudley Jr., S.C. Kyle J.W. French R.J.

IUS can be modulated by molecules binding to the outer vestibule (10Todt H. Dudley Jr., S.C. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Biophys.

On the other hand, the IUS state can be modulated by binding of the inactivation lid to the internal vestibule (11Hilber K. Sandtner W. Kudlacek O. Schreiner B. Glaaser I. Schütz W. Fozzard H.A.

Furthermore, the local anesthetic drug lidocaine, which binds to the internal part of the channel pore (13Ragsdale D.S. McPhee J.C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 9270-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), inhibits entry into IUS by a “foot-in-the-door” mechanism (14Sandtner W. Szendroedi J. Zarrabi T. Zebedin E. Hilber K. Glaaser I. Fozzard H.A. Dudley S.C. Todt H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 648-657PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that a closure of the inner vestibule is involved in the generation of IUS. To explain the involvement of both the outer and the inner vestibule in IUS, we proposed a model in which the mutation K1237E produces a conformational change of the outer vestibule, which is transmitted to the internal vestibule through the DIV-S6 segment (12Szendroedi J.

Hence, the mechanism of inactivation may be analogous to the one proposed by Cuello et al. (8Cuello L.G. Jogini V. Cortes D.M. Perozo E.

In voltage-gated Na+ channels the S6 segment corresponds to TM2 in KcsA. Here, we present the results of a cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the intracellular part of the S6 segment of domain IV (DIV-S6) to detect a possible interaction site with the selectivity filter. We find that IUS generated by a mutation in the selectivity filter of the rNaV1.4 channel (K1237E) can be abolished by an additional mutation at the site 1575 in DIV-S6. This effect is unique to site 1575 because no other mutation in the DIV-S6 was able to remove the IUS state. In a previously published homology model Ile-1575 of DIV-S6 is in close spatial proximity to the side chain of Lys-1237 of the DIII P-loop, suggesting an interaction between these amino acids (2Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8161-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These data support the idea of a trans-protein communication via the selectivity filter and the adjacent inner helices. Furthermore, in the absence of a crystal structure for the voltage-gated Na+ channel, our functional data for the first time determine the position of the selectivity filter in the pore relative to the DIV-S6 segment. ultra-slow inactivation domains I-IV adult rat skeletal muscle isoform of the voltage-gated sodium channel. A vector consisting of the rNaV1.4 coding sequence flanked by Xenopus globin 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was provided as a gift by R. Moorman (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). This was used as the template for inserting oligonucleotide-directed point mutations by either four primer PCR and subsequent subcloning into the template using directional ligations or the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotide primers containing a mutation were designed with a change in a silent restriction site to allow rapid identification of the mutant. Incorporation of the mutation into the template was then confirmed by DNA sequencing. Double mutants were made by subcloning the region of the DIV-S6 segment that contained the mutation into the rNaV1.4-K1237E construct. All constructs were linearized by either SpeI or SalI and transcribed with either T7 (SpeI-linearized) or SP6 (SalI-linearized) RNA polymerase using the respective mMessage mMachine Kits according to the manufacturer's protocols (Ambion, Austin, TX). Stage V and VI Xenopus oocytes were isolated from female frogs (NASCO, Ft. Atkinson, WI), washed with a solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (titrated to pH 7.4 with 10 m NaOH), treated with 1 mg/ml collagenase for 0.5 to 1 h, and had their follicular cell layers manually removed. As judged from photometric measurements, ∼50–100 ng of cRNA were injected into each oocyte with a Drummond micro-injector (Broomall, PA). Oocytes were incubated at 17.5 °C for 8 h to 14 days before examination in a solution containing 90 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1 g/liter dextrose. All chemicals were of the purest grade available and were purchased from Sigma. Recordings were made in the two-electrode voltage clamp configuration using a TEC 10CD clamp (npi electronic, Tamm, Germany). The clamp amplifier had a series resistance compensation circuit. For accurate adjustment of the experimental temperature (18 ± 0.5 °C), an oocyte bath cooling system (HE 204, Dagan, Minneapolis, MN) was used. Oocytes were placed in recording chambers in which the bath flow rate was about 100 ml/h, and the bath level was adjusted so that the total bath volume was less than 500 μl. Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of less than 0.5 megaohms. Using pCLAMP6 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) software, data were acquired at 71.4 kHz after low-pass filtration at 2 kHz (−3 decibel). Curve-fitting was performed using OriginPro 7.5 (MicroCal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). Recordings were made in a bathing solution that consisted of 90 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES titrated to pH 7.4 with 10 m NaOH. BaCl2 was used as a replacement for CaCl2 to minimize Ca2+-activated Cl− currents. For the experiments in which Na+ was replaced by other monovalent cations, 90 mm NaCl in the standard extracellular solution was replaced by 90 mm of the respective test cation as chloride salt, and the buffer was titrated with Tris base. The following chemicals were used for these experiments: choline chloride, methylamine hydrochloride, and diethylamine hydrochloride (all from Sigma). Modeling was accomplished in the Insight and Discover graphical environments (Biosym Technologies Inc., San Diego, CA) as described previously (16Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The homology-modeled structure of the pore of the Na+ channel was fixed in all calculations except for the side chains of the amino acid residues forming the selectivity filter, Asp-400, Glu-755, Lys-1237 and Ala-1529. If not otherwise specified, recovery from IUS was tested with the following experimental protocol, as reported previously (10Todt H. Dudley Jr., S.C. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1335-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). From a holding potential of −120 mV, the channels were inactivated by a 300-s depolarizing voltage step to −20 mV. This prepulse duration, rather than longer ones, was normally chosen to avoid unacceptably long experimental durations. After the prepulse, the potential was returned to −120 mV, and recovery from inactivation was monitored by repetitive 20-ms test pulses to −20 mV at 20-s intervals. The first test pulse was applied 20 s after the prepulse to allow for recovery from faster forms of inactivation (fast and slow inactivation). The time courses of recovery from IUS of normalized peak inward currents were fit with the bi-exponential function (Equation 1), I2/I1=-A1exp(-t/τ1)-A2exp(-t/τ2)+C(Eq. 1) where I2 is the peak inward Na+ current of the test pulse during recovery, I1 is the peak inward Na+ current of a test pulse under fully available conditions, τ1 and τ2 are the time constants of distinct components of recovery from inactivation (slow inactivation and IUS, respectively), A1 and A2 are the respective amplitudes of these time constants, and C is the final level of recovery. A2 was taken as a measure of the fraction of channels that recovered from IUS. Current-voltage relationships were fit with the function (Equation 2), Gmax(V-Vrev)(1(1/(1+exp((V-V0.5)/K))))(Eq. 2) where V is the step potential, Gmax is the maximum conductance, V0.5 is the voltage at which half-maximum activation occurred, Vrev is the reversal potential, and K is the slope factor. The permeability ratio of choline was computed relative to 90 mm Na+ from the change in the reversal potential observed in going from the bath solution containing 90 mm Na+ to the bath solution in which 90 mm Na+ was replaced by 90 mm choline, according to Tsushima et al. (17Tsushima R.G. Li R.A. Backx P.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; Equation 3). Pcholine/PNa+=[Na+]/[choline]exp(ΔV/α)(Eq. 3) where ΔV = Vcholine − VNa+, and α = RT/F = 25.4 mV. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E.M. Statistical comparisons were made using two-tailed Student's t tests. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Fig. 1 shows the time course of recovery from IUS produced by a 300-s depolarizing prepulse to −20 mV in wild type rNaV1.4 channels and in the mutant K1237E. Currents through wild type channels recover completely within 40–60 s after the prepulse. As described previously (10Todt H. Dudley Jr., S.C. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1335-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the mutation K1237E substantially prolongs the time course of recovery. The normalized time course can be fitted with two exponentials reflecting recovery from at least two inactivated states. The smaller time constant most likely corresponds to recovery from “slow inactivation” (18Kambouris N.G. Hastings L.A. Stepanovic S. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. Balser J.R. J. Physiol. 1998; 512: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas the greater time constant represents recovery from IUS (10Todt H. Dudley Jr., S.C. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1335-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Charge-altering mutations of amino acids at homologous positions in other domains do not induce IUS by the applied protocol (Fig. 1C). Molecular modeling predicts that Lys-1237 in the domain III P-loop is in close proximity to Ile-1575 of the DIV-S6 (Fig. 2A). If IUS occurred by an interaction between the P-loops and the adjacent S6 segment, then Ile-1575 is a likely partner for such an interaction. Therefore, we tested whether substitutions of the amino acid side chain at position 1575 affected the propensity of the mutant K1237E to enter into IUS. For control purposes we also explored the effect of mutating residues Phe-1579 and Tyr-1586, which are predicted to face the pore at more internal positions along the permeation pathway (2Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8161-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Ragsdale D.S. McPhee J.C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 9270-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the normalized time course of recovery from a 300-s conditioning prepulse to −20 mV in K1237E and the previously mentioned double mutants. The data points were well fit with a bi-exponential function (Equation 1), and the parameters derived from the fits are shown in Table 1. IUS was substantially enhanced when K1237E was combined with F1579A and Y1586A. In fact, the amplitudes of IUS in these double mutants exceeded the amplitude of IUS in the single mutant K1237E. Most interestingly, however, when K1237E was combined with I1575A, the amplitude of IUS was not enhanced but was reduced to the wild type level (Table 1). Hence, whereas the addition of F1579A and Y1586A enhanced IUS in the background of K1237E, the combination with I1575A appeared to protect K1237E channels from entry into IUS.TABLE 1Parameters derived from nonlinear curve fits of Equation 1 (“Experimental Procedures”) to the time course of recovery from IUS as determined by the protocol shown in Fig. 1Aτ1A1τ2A2Wild type7.05 ± 1.010.95 ± 0.01120.00 ± 0.000.05 ± 0.01K1237E5.67 ± 0.810.36 ± 0.04ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.183.92 ± 9.58ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.0.64 ± 0.04ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.I1575A9.14 ± 0.600.96 ± 0.01120.00 ± 0.000.04 ± 0.01F1579A11.71 ± 0.260.71 ± 0.04ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.158.57 ± 26.02ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.0.29 ± 0.04ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.Y1586A11.62 ± 0.760.51 ± 0.06ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.127.88 ± 7.88ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.0.49 ± 0.06ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.K1237E/I1575A6.90 ± 0.320.93 ± 0.02120.00 ± 0.000.08 ± 0.02K1237E/F1579A9.24 ± 0.760.09 ± 0.04ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.294.99 ± 65.36ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.0.90 ± 0.04ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.K1237E/Y1586A8.00 ± 1.320.05 ± 0.01ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.448.66 ± 35.33ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.0.94 ± 0.03ap < 0.01 as compared with wild type.a p < 0.01 as compared with wild type. Open table in a new tab As mentioned above, the amplitude of IUS in the double mutants K1237E/F1579A and K1237E/Y1586A were larger than in the single mutant K1237E. This raises the question of whether mutations in DIV-S6 alone modulated IUS. Hence, we tested the single mutants I1575A, F1579A, and Y1586A for their effects on IUS. As shown in Fig. 3B, full recovery from inactivation produced by a 300-s conditioning pulse was achieved by the second to third test pulse, i.e. 40–60 s after the inactivating prepulse in WT and I1575A. In F1579A and Y1586A, however, full recovery did not occur after ∼10 test pulses (200 s) had elapsed. As shown in Table 1, the amplitude of the slow recovering component, A2, representing the fraction of channels recovering from IUS, was significantly greater with F1579A and Y1586A than with I1575A and wild type. Thus, the single mutants F1579A and Y1586A enhanced the propensity to enter the IUS state, although to a lesser degree than the mutant K1237E in the selectivity filter (Fig. 1). The fact that single mutations in the DIV-S6 segment enhance the propensity of rNaV1.4 channels to enter IUS supports our hypothesis that both the inner and the outer vestibule of the channel are involved in the generation of this inactivated state (14Sandtner W. Szendroedi J. Zarrabi T. Zebedin E. Hilber K. Glaaser I. Fozzard H.A. Dudley S.C. Todt H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 648-657PubMed Google Scholar). One explanation for the differential effect of the mentioned S6 substitutions on IUS is suggested by the molecular model shown in Fig. 2A. In this model Ile-1575 in DIV-S6 is in close proximity to Lys-1237 in the selectivity filter. The mutation K1237E has been shown to increase the permeability for large cations, suggesting that this mutation increases the diameter of the selectivity filter (19Favre I. Moczydlowski E. Schild L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3110-3125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20Sunami A. Glaaser I.W. Fozzard H.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Most likely, this increase in diameter is produced by a “lateral swinging” of Glu-1237 (Ref. 21Huang C.J. Moczydlowski E. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1262-1279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; Fig. 4). Such a conformational change is reasonable because the P-loops have been shown to be flexible structures in studies involving paired cysteine substitutions that allow disulfide bond formation (22Tsushima R.G. Li R.A. Backx P.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Xiong W. Li R.A. Tian Y. Tomaselli G.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The lateral motion of Glu-1237 may then alter the nature of the interaction with the neighboring S6 residue Ile-1575 (Fig. 4B). In the double mutant K1237E/I1575A changes in the properties of the side chain of Ala-1575 may alter the nature of interaction with Glu-1237, thereby protecting this mutant from entry into IUS. To further test this idea we introduced a cysteine at site 1575. The side chain of cysteine is both larger and more reactive than that of alanine. Presumably, replacement of the native amino acids by cysteine will impose greater structural changes in DIV-S6 than mutations to alanine. Furthermore, we wanted to test whether amino acid replacements at sites in the DIV-S6 segment more internal to 1575 were also capable of protecting K1237E from entry into IUS. To this end we produced serial cysteine replacements of all residues C-terminal to Ile-1575 in the DIV-S6 segment in the background of the wild type rNaV1.4 channel and in the background of the mutation K1237E. Fig. 5 shows the amplitude of IUS produced by a 300-s depolarization to −20 mV in single cysteine replacements of amino acids in DIV-S6. I1576C and N1584C did not express sufficient current in order to be studied. Most of the remaining mutants had moderately higher amplitudes of IUS than wild type but significantly less than K1237E. As with I1575A, I1575C had a similar amplitude of IUS as wild type. Hence, among the mutated DIV-S6 sites, position 1575 appears to be unique in not enhancing the propensity of entry into IUS.FIGURE 5Effect of cysteine scanning mutagenesis of the DIV-S6 segment on IUS. Shown is the result of double exponential fits (Equation 1) to the time course of recovery from a prolonged depolarization as shown in Fig. 1A. Because of the low amplitude of recovery from IUS in these mutants, the parameter τ2 was fixed at 120 s during the fitting procedure. The asterisks indicate significant differences from wild type (**, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; n = 5–7). With the exception of I1575C, all mutants significantly enhanced recovery from IUS, indicating a role of the DIV-S6 segment in the generation of the IUS state. Mutants I1576C and N1584C did not express sufficient current to be studied.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetic analysis of double mutants in which the K1237E background was combined with serial replacements of DIV-S6 amino acids C-terminal to Ile-1575 are presented in FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7. As with the single mutants, all constructs except mutations at sites 1576 and 1584 expressed enough current to be studied. With one exception, all double mutants in DIV-S6 either did not affect IUS or produced an increase in the amplitude of IUS. Only in K1237E/I1575C did the fraction of channels recovering from IUS decrease significantly when compared with K1237E. However, whereas the replacement by alanine of Ile-1575 reduced the amplitude of IUS in K1237E to wild type levels (<20%, Table 1), introduction of a cysteine at site 1575 still allowed for entry of about 30% of channels into IUS (Fig. 7B), i.e. a percentage intermediate between wild type and K1237E. To further elucidate the kinetic changes imposed by the combination of K1237E with I1575C, we determined the effect of prolonging the duration of the inactiv"
https://openalex.org/W2124673961,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades regulate a wide variety of cellular processes that ultimately depend on changes in gene expression. We have found a novel mechanism whereby one of the key MAP3 kinases, Mekk1, regulates transcriptional activity through an interaction with p53. The tumor suppressor protein p53 down-regulates a number of genes, including the gene most frequently mutated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD1). We have discovered that Mekk1 translocates to the nucleus and acts as a co-repressor with p53 to down-regulate PKD1 transcriptional activity. This repression does not require Mekk1 kinase activity, excluding the need for an Mekk1 phosphorylation cascade. However, this PKD1 repression can also be induced by the stress-pathway stimuli, including TNFα, suggesting that Mekk1 activation induces both JNK-dependent and JNK-independent pathways that target the PKD1 gene. An Mekk1-p53 interaction at the PKD1 promoter suggests a new mechanism by which abnormally elevated stress-pathway stimuli might directly down-regulate the PKD1 gene, possibly causing haploinsufficiency and cyst formation."
https://openalex.org/W2063949835,"Fredericamycin (FDM) A is a pentadecaketide natural product that features an amide linkage. Analysis of the fdm cluster from Streptomyces griseus ATCC 43944, however, failed to reveal genes encoding the types of amide synthetases commonly seen in natural product biosynthesis. Here, we report in vivo and in vitro characterizations of FdmV, an asparagine synthetase (AS) B-like protein, as an amide synthetase that catalyzes the amide bond formation in FDM A biosynthesis. This is supported by the findings that (i) inactivation of fdmV in vivo afforded the ΔfdmV mutant strain SB4027 that abolished FDM A and FDM E production but accumulated FDM C, a biosynthetic intermediate devoid of the characteristic amide linkage; (ii) FdmV in vitro catalyzes conversion of FDM C to FDM B, a known intermediate for FDM A biosynthesis (apparent K(m) = 162 ± 67 μM and k(cat) = 0.11 ± 0.02 min(-1)); and (iii) FdmV also catalyzes the amidation of FDM M-3, a structural analog of FDM C, to afford amide FDM M-6 in vitro, albeit at significantly reduced efficiency. Preliminary enzymatic studies revealed that, in addition to the common nitrogen sources (L-Gln and free amine) of class II glutamine amidotransferases (to which AS B belongs), FdmV can also utilize L-Asn as a nitrogen donor. The amide bond formation in FDM A biosynthesis is proposed to occur after C-8 hydroxylation but before the carbaspirocycle formation."
https://openalex.org/W2064520646,"Previously, we have shown that lack of expression of triadins in skeletal muscle cells results in significant increase of myoplasmic resting free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](rest)), suggesting a role for triadins in modulating global intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. To understand this mechanism, we study here how triadin alters [Ca(2+)](rest), Ca(2+) release, and Ca(2+) entry pathways using a combination of Ca(2+) microelectrodes, channels reconstituted in bilayer lipid membranes (BLM), Ca(2+), and Mn(2+) imaging analyses of myotubes and RyR1 channels obtained from triadin-null mice. Unlike WT cells, triadin-null myotubes had chronically elevated [Ca(2+)](rest) that was sensitive to inhibition with ryanodine, suggesting that triadin-null cells have increased basal RyR1 activity. Consistently, BLM studies indicate that, unlike WT-RyR1, triadin-null channels more frequently display atypical gating behavior with multiple and stable subconductance states. Accordingly, pulldown analysis and fluorescent FKBP12 binding studies in triadin-null muscles revealed a significant impairment of the FKBP12/RyR1 interaction. Mn(2+) quench rates under resting conditions indicate that triadin-null cells also have higher Ca(2+) entry rates and lower sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) load than WT cells. Overexpression of FKBP12.6 reverted the null phenotype, reducing resting Ca(2+) entry, recovering sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) content levels, and restoring near normal [Ca(2+)](rest). Exogenous FKBP12.6 also reduced the RyR1 channel P(o) but did not rescue subconductance behavior. In contrast, FKBP12 neither reduced P(o) nor recovered multiple subconductance gating. These data suggest that elevated [Ca(2+)](rest) in triadin-null myotubes is primarily driven by dysregulated RyR1 channel activity that results in part from impaired FKBP12/RyR1 functional interactions and a secondary increased Ca(2+) entry at rest."
https://openalex.org/W2146258142,"The turnover of damaged proteins is critical to cell survival during stressful conditions such as heat shock or oxidative stress. The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is toxic to cells. Therefore these proteins must be efficiently exported from the ER and degraded by the proteasome or the vacuole. Previously it was shown that the loss of eukaryotic elongation factor 1Bγ (eEF1Bγ) from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in resistance to oxidative stress. Strains lacking eEF1Bγ show severe defects in protein turnover during conditions of oxidative stress. Furthermore, these strains accumulate a greater amount of oxidized proteins, which correlates with changes in heat shock chaperones. These strains show severe defects in vacuole morphology and defects related to the maturation of carboxypeptidase Y that is not dependent on the catalytic subunit of the eEF1B complex as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Finally, eEF1Bγ co-immunoprecipitates with an essential component of ER-Golgi transport vesicles. Taken together, these results support a broader protein metabolism role for eEF1Bγ."
https://openalex.org/W2007928177,"In the natural environment, bacterial cells have to adjust their metabolism to alterations in the availability of food sources. The order and timing of gene expression are crucial in these situations to produce an appropriate response. We used the galactose regulation in Escherichia coli as a model system for understanding how cells integrate information about food availability and cAMP levels to adjust the timing and intensity of gene expression. We simulated the feast-famine cycle of bacterial growth by diluting stationary phase cells in fresh medium containing galactose as the sole carbon source. We followed the activities of six promoters of the galactose system as cells grew on and ran out of galactose. We found that the cell responds to a decreasing external galactose level by increasing the internal galactose level, which is achieved by limiting galactose metabolism and increasing the expression of transporters. We show that the cell alters gene expression based primarily on the current state of the cell and not on monitoring the level of extracellular galactose in real time. Some decisions have longer term effects; therefore, the current state does subtly encode the history of food availability. In summary, our measurements of timing of gene expression in the galactose system suggest that the system has evolved to respond to environments where future galactose levels are unpredictable rather than regular feast and famine cycles.

In summary, our measurements of timing of gene expression in the galactose system suggest that the system has evolved to respond to environments where future galactose levels are unpredictable rather than regular feast and famine cycles. Transport and metabolism of several sugars are controlled via two feedback loops connected by a common regulator that senses the intracellular concentration of the small molecule (1Krishna S. Semsey S. Sneppen K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20815-20819Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 2Sneppen K. Krishna S. Semsey S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 39: 43-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The simplest systems (e.g. the lactose utilization system in Escherichia coli) consist of two operons, a regulator gene and a regulated operon containing at least two cistrons, one encoding a transporter and the other encoding an enzyme that modifies/degrades the small molecule (3Monod J. Changeux J.P. Jacob F. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 6: 306-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). In such systems, the genes encoding the sugar transporter (e.g. lacY) and the enzyme for sugar degradation (e.g. lacZ) are regulated simultaneously. However, many sugar utilization systems reached higher levels of complexity, e.g. having multiple transporters, regulators, or several enzymes of a metabolic pathway. For example, the gal system of E. coli contains genes involved in the transport (galP and mglBAC) and amphibolic utilization (galETKM) of the sugar d-galactose. Genes of the gal regulon belong to different operons (4Weickert M.J. Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This setup allows differential regulation of functions when needed. Regulation of the gal system is governed by two similar regulators, GalR and GalS, which are regulated in different ways (5Geanacopoulos M. Adhya S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 228-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Semsey S. Krishna S. Sneppen K. Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Weickert M.J. Adhya S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 251-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that GalS plays only a minor role in steady-state conditions but becomes important transiently when a high level of extracellular galactose is quickly decreased (8Semsey S. Krishna S. Erdossy J. Horváth P. Orosz L. Sneppen K. Adhya S. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4487-4491Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Besides sensing the intracellular sugar level, galactose utilization is also regulated by the cAMP-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) 2The abbreviations used are: CRPcAMP receptor proteinRNAPRNA polymerase. complex. cAMP is a signal of carbon shortage and is sensed by CRP. cAMP is synthesized intracellularly by adenylate cyclase (CyaA), which is activated when phosphorylation of Enzyme IIAGlc of the phosphotransferase system is increased (9Park Y.H. Lee B.R. Seok Y.J. Peterkofsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6448-6454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Reddy P. Kamireddi M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 732-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, CyaA activity can also be regulated by a so far unknown mechanism in the presence of certain non-phosphotransferase system sugars. This mechanism does not depend on the phosphotransferase system enzymes (11Epstein W. Rothman-Denes L.B. Hesse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1975; 72: 2300-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 12Hogema B.M. Arents J.C. Inada T. Aiba H. van Dam K. Postma P.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Galactose availability also strongly influences the intracellular cAMP level; cells grown in a galactose-limited chemostat show substantially higher cAMP levels than cells grown in a high-galactose batch culture (13Death A. Ferenci T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5101-5107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of the galactose transport systems (GalP and MglBAC) is highly dependent on the presence of cAMP-CRP. However, transcription of the gal operon genes, encoding the enzymes involved in galactose utilization, occurs in both the presence and absence of cAMP-CRP when galactose is available (6Semsey S. Krishna S. Sneppen K. Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The galETKM operon is transcribed from two promoters, P1galE and P2galE. In the absence of cAMP-CRP, P2galE predominantly expresses the promoter-proximal galE gene and very little galK (natural polarity), whereas in the presence of cAMP-CRP, the P1galE promoter expresses all of the structural genes at an equimolar level, whereas P2galE transcription is inhibited (14Guidi-Rontani C. Danchin A. Ullmann A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Lee H.J. Jeon H.J. Ji S.C. Yun S.H. Lim H.M. J. Mol.

Because the galE gene product is involved in making substrates for biosynthetic glycosylation reactions, and all of the gal enzymes are needed for catabolism of the sugar d-galactose, it appears that the P2galE transcript serves anabolic requirements, whereas transcription from P1galE provides for catabolism of d-galactose as a carbon source. cAMP receptor protein RNA polymerase. Proper timing of gene expression is crucial in the regulation of critical biological phenomena, i.e. cellular adaptation, differentiation, and development (17Gaudet J. Muttumu S. Horner M. Mango S.E. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e352Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Amir A. Kobiler O. Rokney A. Oppenheim A.B. Stavans J. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2007; 3: 71Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Biological systems evolved two fundamentally different mechanisms for the regulation of timing. One possibility is that, after an initial decision, a regulatory network proceeds autonomously, executing a predefined program (18Amir A. Kobiler O. Rokney A. Oppenheim A.B. Stavans J. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2007; 3: 71Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Johnson C.H. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2004; 6: 103-110PubMed Google Scholar). The other possibility is that the network monitors specific signals in real time and regulates timing accordingly. The goal of this work is to understand the principles governing the timing of gene expression in sugar networks when cells are grown in a batch culture containing a single sugar as a carbon source. We monitored how promoter activities in the galactose utilization network change as the cell population grows and galactose is exhausted from the medium, using specific promoter-uidABC (gus) reporter fusions. Besides responding to system-specific regulators, gene expression is also influenced by global effects, which depend on the physiological state of the cell (20Klumpp S. Hwa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20245-20250Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 21Klumpp S. Zhang Z. Hwa T.

Biol. 1999; 292: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because cell physiology changed in our experiments, we used a promoter that is not regulated by GalR, GalS, or cAMP-CRP as a control. On the basis of the experimental results, we built a mathematical model to calculate intracellular d-galactose and cAMP-CRP levels. We found that intracellular reporter protein levels were higher in the stationary phase than in the early exponential phase in all cases. However, the gal regulon promoters differed in the timing of transcription and consequently in the timing of intracellular accumulation of the reporter proteins. Promoter activities were highly dynamic compared with intracellular reporter protein levels, which changed only 2–6-fold depending on the promoter used. We discuss how regulatory structure and signal integration logic affect timing of gene transcription. Regulatory regions and promoters of the gal regulon operons were amplified by PCR using E. coli MG1655 chromosomal DNA as a template (GenBankTM accession number NC_000913.2) and inserted between the EcoRI and PstI sites in plasmid pSEM2027. The amplified regulatory regions were the following: spf (4047775–4047954), galR (2974441–2974680), galP (3086041–3086297), the galETKM operon (791519 to 791214), galS (2239921 to 2239711), and the mglBAC operon (2238720 to 2238439). We used a promoter that is not regulated by cAMP-CRP or GalR as a control (GenBankTM accession number GQ872202) (23Hunziker A. Tuboly C. Horváth P. Krishna S. Semsey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 12998-13003Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). pSEM2027 derivatives containing the cloned regulatory regions were digested with BamHI and used as a template for PCR amplification. The amplified region contained the Zeocin cassette, the rrnBT1T2 terminators, the cloned promoter region, and part of the gusA ORF. This region was amplified using the “uidRZdn” (5′-ACCCGGATCCTCAATGCTGCCAGAGAGATTTTTTCAGAAAATGGATTTCACGGAATTCTCAGTCCTGCTCCTCGGCCAC-3′) and “Gusseqdn” (5′-TTCTTGTAACGCGCTTTCCCACCAAC-3′) primers. The ends of the resulting PCR fragment contained sequences of the uid region of the E. coli chromosome (50/128 bp), allowing efficient insertion using recombination-mediated genetic engineering. The PCR product was purified from an agarose gel. Recombination-mediated genetic engineering was performed according to the protocol described by Datsenko and Wanner (24Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11196) Google Scholar). As a result, the region upstream of the uidA ORF, between chromosomal positions 1694107 and 1694987 (GenBankTM accession number U00096), was replaced with the synthetic construct. Recombinants were selected on LB plates containing 80 μg/ml Zeocin. Cells were grown overnight, and total genomic DNA was extracted using the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). The regulatory region upstream of the uidABC operon was amplified by PCR (Platinum HiFi Supermix, Invitrogen) using the “KpnT1T2” (5′-ATATATGGTACCAAGCTTCTGTTTTGGCGGATGAGA-3′) and Gusseqdn primers. The DNA sequence was determined by BIOMI Ltd. (Gödöllő, Hungary). Cells were grown overnight in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml Zeocin and diluted 1000-fold for further growth in M63 medium containing 10 μg/ml Zeocin and supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) d-galactose, 0.1% (w/v) casamino acids (Sigma A2427), and 0.004% (w/v) vitamin B1. At various times, aliquots of cells were removed, diluted in 1 ml of LB medium to OD600 = 0.2, pelleted, resuspended in M63 medium containing 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and stored at −70 °C. To determine the activity of β-glucuronidase in cells, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme was added to 500 μl of cell suspension. After incubation for 15 min on ice, 250 μl of permeabilization buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 8), 32 mm sodium phosphate, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mm CDTA, and 4% Triton X-100), containing 200 μg/ml polymyxin B (25Schupp J.M.

Cells were allowed to permeabilize at room temperature for 15 min before 250-μl aliquots of GUS assay buffer (0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0)) containing 1.25 mm α-p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucuronide were added. The rate of β-glucuronide hydrolysis at 37 °C was determined by measuring absorbance at 405 nm at least five different times. CRP was purified as described by Ryu et al. (26Ryu S. Kim J. Adhya S. Garges S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). σ38 was purified using the IMPACT system (New England Biolabs) as described by Shin et al. (27Shin M. Song M. Rhee J.H. Hong Y. Kim Y.J. Seok Y.J. Ha K.S. Jung S.H. Choy H.E.

Biochemical Corp. Transcription reactions were performed as described previously (5Geanacopoulos M. Adhya S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 228-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 200 mm potassium glutamate, and 2 nm supercoiled DNA template. CRP was used at 50 nm and cAMP at 100 μm, when present. 20 nm RNA polymerase was added before incubating the reactions at 37 °C for 5 min. Transcription was started by the addition of 1.0 mm ATP, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.1 mm CTP, 0.01 mm UTP, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). Reactions were terminated after 10 min by the addition of an equal volume of transcription loading buffer (0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.01 m EDTA, and 90% deionized formamide). After heating at 90 °C for 3 min, the samples were loaded onto urea-7% polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gels. RNA bands were quantified using the ImageQuantTM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Ref. 28Krishna S. Orosz L. Sneppen K. Adhya S. Semsey S. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar describes a model that takes a time series of d-Gal and cAMP-CRP levels and provides activities of PgalR, PgalS, PmglB, PgalP, P1galE, and P2galE. These are further incorporated into two differential equations that compute how the levels of GalR and GalS change with time. We extended this model to include similar differential equations for the β-glucuronidase reporters for each promoter: dP/dt = νiAi − γ(t)P, where i = PgalR, PgalE, PgalP, PgalS, PmglB, or Pspf. (As is the case for GalR and GalS, β-glucuronidase is assumed to be stable and diluted only by cell growth.) This model, consisting of these five differential equations in addition to the model of Ref. 28Krishna S. Orosz L. Sneppen K. Adhya S. Semsey S. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, has the following unknown parameters: the maximal production rates of β-glucuronidase under each promoter (νi), the time series for d-Gal, and the time series for cAMP-CRP. We varied these parameters and observed how well the resulting time series of β-glucuronidase under different promoters fitted the measured β-glucuronidase levels. We found a good fit by minimizing the least-square distance between model and observed β-glucuronidase levels using simulated annealing (29Otten R.H.J.M. van Ginneken L.P.P.P. The Annealing Algorithm. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1989Crossref Google Scholar), a general algorithm for solving global optimization problems. The algorithm was implemented using C, and results were visualized in MATLAB. Bacterial growth in batch cultures has six distinct stages: lag phase (growth rate-null), acceleration phase (growth rate increases), exponential phase (growth rate constant), retardation phase (growth rate decreases), stationary phase (growth rate-null), and the phase of decline (“death phase,” growth rate-negative) (30Monod J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1949; 3: 371-394Crossref Google Scholar). When diluted in fresh medium, cells first adjust their gene expression pattern to the new conditions. After this initial period, cells start to replicate, resulting in a continuous decrease in the level of available resources in the growth medium. As nutrients become limited, cells undergo an elaborate physiological and morphological differentiation to adapt to starvation. To monitor how the galactose network of E. coli responds when cells meet a finite pool of d-galactose in a limited volume, we created seven promoter-uidABC reporter fusions using the PgalR, PgalE, PgalP, PgalS, PmglB, and Pspf promoter regions and a control promoter that is not regulated by GalR, GalS, or cAMP-CRP (“unregulated” promoter). The fusions were transferred on the chromosome of the reference strain MG1655 separately, resulting in seven strains. Strains were grown in LB medium overnight and then diluted in supplemented M63 minimal medium containing d-galactose as the sole carbon source. The level of the reporter protein (UidA = GusA) was determined at different times by measuring β-glucuronidase activities in 0.5 ml of cells diluted to OD600 = 0.2. The actual level of the reporter protein is affected by production and dilution by cell division. Therefore, for each sample measured, we recorded the optical density of the culture at 600 nm and the time counted from dilution of the culture in the minimal medium (Fig. 1). All the reporter fusions studied behaved similarly in the sense that the intracellular β-glucuronidase level increased from an initial lower level to a higher level. The change was only 2–6-fold depending on the promoter used. The timing and the speed of the transition between the low and high states varied significantly for the different promoters. In four cases (spf, galE, galP, and galR), the transition occurred in the 400–600-min interval, during the shift from fast growth to very slow growth. However, in the other two cases (galS and mglB), the transition happened later, when cell doubling was almost negligible (650–800 min). In the case of the unregulated promoter, the transition between the low and high states was less sharp. From the measured OD values, we could determine how the growth rate (γ) of bacteria changed with time using the following formula: γ(t) = (d/dt)ln(OD(t)). The data show that the growth rate dropped from a maximum of 1.225 doublings/h at t = 285 min to a minimum of ∼0.011 doublings/h at t = 715 min, after which the growth rate slightly increased again and then remained steady at 0.06 doublings/h until the end of the experiment. Before t = 180 min, we had no OD measurements, but we assume that the growth rate started at zero, remained there for a lag period of ∼100 min, and then rose to its maximum at 285 min (Fig. 2A). The concentration of the β-glucuronidase protein (P) in the cell is determined by the rate of protein production and by the dilution of the cell contents due to cell division. Assuming that the rate of protein production is proportional to promoter activities (A) and that the optical density of the culture (OD) is proportional to the cell number, we can calculate a time series for the promoter activities using the following equation: A = (Pt+Δt − Pt(ODt)/ODt+Δt)/ΔT. From the enzyme activity measurements of the unregulated promoter, a promoter activity time series was calculated in the same way as for the other strains. This activity, normalized to 1, was then used to scale all other promoter activities to take growth rate-dependent effects (e.g. gene copy/cell) and the varying resource availability (e.g. abundance of RNA polymerases and ribosomes) into account (Fig. 3). Unlike in previous reports using balanced growth conditions (20Klumpp S. Hwa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20245-20250Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 21Klumpp S. Zhang Z.

Biol. 1999; 292: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), in our experiments, the growth rate and the computed activity of the unregulated promoter did not show a direct correlation. One possible explanation for this observation is that besides production of ATP, the galactose metabolism pathway also affects other cellular processes. For example, availability of the intermediate metabolite UDP-galactose affects peptidoglycan synthesis and transcription (31Lee S.J. Trostel A. Le P. Harinarayanan R. Fitzgerald P.C. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19515-19520Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The results show that, in the galactose system, promoter activities have different timing patterns, and the scaled activities follow two different trajectories (Fig. 3, gray lines). The activities of PgalR, PgalE, and Pspf can be characterized by a fast initial increase, followed by a sharp drop, resulting in a single peak. In the case of PgalR and PgalE, the peak is broader for the non-scaled activities. The scaled PgalP, PgalS, and PmglB start expression patterns are similar, having two separate activity peaks, the first at ∼250 min and the second at ∼600 min for PgalP and 700 min for PgalS and PmglB. The scaled and non-scaled timing patterns (Fig. 3, gray versus black lines) show only moderate differences, suggesting that the timing of gene expression is mostly determined by the system-specific regulators (GalR, GalS, and cAMP-CRP). The measured promoter activities are functions of the intracellular cAMP-CRP and/or d-galactose levels and the gene expression capacity of cells. Conversely, given time series of the promoter activities, it is, in principle, possible to deduce the time development of cAMP-CRP and d-galactose. Ref. 28Krishna S. Orosz L. Sneppen K. Adhya S. Semsey S. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar describes a model that, given the intracellular cAMP-CRP and d-galactose levels, computes the activities of all gal regulon promoters. We used this model to find the cAMP-CRP and d-galactose time series that best fit the reporter protein activities we measured (normalized to the unregulated control to eliminate the effects of cell physiology). We found that the d-Gal level started rising significantly from t ∼ 400 min onward, until it peaked at t ∼ 650 min (Fig. 2B). After that, the level quickly decreased until t = 720 (the time at which the growth rate reached its minimum) before moderately increasing again. This increase is consistent with the production of the Mgl transport system at 700 min. As expected from previous observations (13Death A. Ferenci T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5101-5107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the cAMP-CRP level is inversely related to the d-Gal level; however, the biochemical background of this observation is not yet understood. The cAMP-CRP level started off high, decreasing to a low level at t = 400 min before rising again at t ∼ 670 min and then dropping again when d-Gal rose at t ∼ 720 min (Fig. 2B). The model of Ref. 28Krishna S. Orosz L. Sneppen K. Adhya S. Semsey S. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar also enabled us to compute the relative contributions of the P1galE and P2galE promoters to galETKM transcription. We found that the main contribution to galETKM transcription throughout the growth curve came from P1galE. P2galE rose for only a relatively short duration around the time when the cAMP-CRP level reached its minimum at t = 670 min (Fig. 4). The transition from exponential to stationary phase is accompanied by replacement of the RNA polymerase-associated σ70 subunit with σ38, the process of which is facilitated by sequestration of σ70 by the Rsd protein (32Jishage M. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4953-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It was previously known that both the vegetative phase (σ70) and stationary phase (σ38) RNA polymerases can transcribe the galETKM operon, although they show different preferences for the P1galE and P2galE promoters (33Kolb A. Kotlarz D. Kusano S. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our results show that the PmglB promoter is active at the later stages of growth, showing ∼45% of its maximal expression at 800 min. To test whether σ38 RNA polymerase can support transcription of PmglB at a rate comparable to σ70 RNA polymerase, we analyzed transcription of the gal regulon promoters by σ38 and σ70 RNA polymerases in vitro in the presence and absence of cAMP-CRP (Fig. 5). Both the σ70 RNA polymerase (RNAP) and σ38 RNAP transcribed only three of the gal regulon promoters, P1galE, P2galE, and PgalR, in the absence of cAMP-CRP. Our results confirmed the previous observation that, as opposed to σ70 RNAP, σ38 RNAP shows strong preference for P1galE and transcribes P2galE weakly (33Kolb A. Kotlarz D. Kusano S. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Like P2galE, PgalR showed lower activity when transcribed by σ38 RNAP compared with σ70 RNAP. Similar to σ70 RNAP transcription, cAMP-CRP activated σ38 RNAP transcription of P1galE, PmglB, PgalP, and PgalS. However, significant differences were obtained in the cAMP-CRP-activated levels of promoter activities. Although the σ38 RNAP-transcribed PmglB activity reached ∼70% of the transcription level obtained with σ70 RNAP, PgalS reached only ∼20% (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 4). Both the strong autoregulation of GalS (8Semsey S. Krishna S. Erdossy J. Horváth P. Orosz L. Sneppen K. Adhya S. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4487-4491Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and the weak transcription of PgalS by σ38 RNAP could explain the fast drop in PgalS activity (compared with PmglB) between 700 and 750 min (Fig. 3). Although P1galE was more efficiently transcribed by σ38 RNAP than by σ70 RNAP in the absence of cAMP-CRP, σ38 RNAP transcription was only slightly increased compared with the activation of σ70 RNAP transcription in the presence of cAMP-CRP. Because the galR and galS genes are poorly transcribed by σ38 RNAP, we suggest that repression of the gal regulon promoters (primarily P1galE and PmglB) in the stationary phase is maintained by the repressor proteins accumulated earlier. Enteric bacteria are evolved to deal with varying nutritional conditions in nature. Nutrients are often limited in the environment (famine), but there are nutrient-rich periods as well (feast). The metabolic and morphological changes accompanying the transitions in the feast-famine cycles have been studied in detail (34Kolter R. Siegele D.A. Tormo A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 855-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In this work, we analyzed how the galactose utilization system of E. coli reacts to the availability of a large but limited galactose pool. We found that galactose metabolism has a global effect on gene expression (e.g. through influencing nucleotide triphosphate levels) and also a specific effect on the transcription of genes belonging to the galactose regulon (through the intracellular d-galactose and cAMP levels, influencing the activity of GalR, GalS, and CRP). We computed changes in the promoter activities of the galactose regulon genes and in the intracellular d-galactose and cAMP-CRP levels. The galactose system monitors the intracellular d-galactose and cAMP-CRP levels in real time and computes the promoter activities accordingly. Because the proteins of the galactose system are assumed to be stable, similar to the reporter protein used, decisions of the system are limited to protein production. The actual intracellular levels of proteins depend on the history of protein production (promoter activity) and dilution (cell division). This is why promoter activities are more dynamic than protein levels. We found that timing of promoter expression depends on the current intracellular signal levels (d-Gal and cAMP-CRP), which are determined by the current extracellular galactose level and the levels of the proteins (and small RNA), affecting galactose transport and utilization (which depend on the history of the cell). Accordingly, decisions in the system are based on the current state of the cell and not on monitoring the level of extracellular galactose in real time. Enzymes encoded by the galETKM operon are responsible for the amphibolic utilization of galactose. All of the Gal enzymes are required for galactose metabolism; however, only GalE is needed for making substrates for biosynthetic glycosylation reactions in the absence of external galactose. Transcription from the P1galE promoter results in equimolar expression of the Gal enzymes, serving the catabolic requirements, whereas transcription from the P2galE promoter results in discoordinated expression (more production of GalE and GalT than the promoter-distal GalK and GalM), which suits the biosynthetic requirements (15Lee H.J. Jeon H.J. Ji S.C. Yun S.H. Lim H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Ullmann A. Joseph E. Danchin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 3194-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 35Semsey S. Virnik K. Adhya S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36Adhya S. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: pe22Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our result that P2galE promoter activity is negligible when cells are grown in a galactose batch culture is consistent with this model. However, production of the proteins encoded by the gal operon can also be discoordinated by the Spot42 small RNA, which specifically inhibits GalK production in the absence of cAMP-CRP (37M⊘ller T. Franch T. Udesen C. Gerdes K. Valentin-Hansen P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In our experiments, transcription of the Spot42 promoter (Pspf) coincided with the increase in the intracellular d-Gal level and with the decrease in the cAMP level. We suggest that inhibition of GalK production by the Spot42 small RNA is involved in balancing galactose transport and metabolism and that this regulation suits cellular needs in an environment where the extracellular galactose concentration is decreasing. Limitation in galactose transport due to the decreasing extracellular galactose concentration can be compensated by increasing the concentration of transporters. To obtain higher expression of transporters, cells need to build up a higher level of intracellular galactose, which in turn also allows increased production of the enzymes involved in galactose utilization. If the system did not reduce the rate of galactose utilization when the galactose influx decreases, the cell would quickly use up the intracellular galactose pool, leading to switching off of promoters by reactivated GalR and GalS and therefore reduced galactose transport and utilization. This effect can be overcome by changing the relative strengths of the transport and metabolism feedback loops (1Krishna S. Semsey S. Sneppen K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20815-20819Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Limiting GalK production is an efficient way to block the metabolic feedback loop without compromising transport, allowing accumulation of intracellular galactose. However, Spot42 is produced at a high rate at low cAMP, regardless of whether the extracellular galactose concentration is decreasing or not. Increasing the transport capacity is likely unnecessary in a high-galactose environment; therefore, we suggest that uncoupling of the transport and metabolism loops by post-transcriptional regulation is a result of adaptation to a fluctuating galactose environment. Spot42 production allows more efficient utilization of galactose at lower extracellular concentrations, and because of the abundance of the Spot42 small RNA, this effect can last for a few cell generations even after its synthesis is stopped (38Mitarai N. Benjamin J.A. Krishna S. Semsey S. Csiszovszki Z. Massé E. Sneppen K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10655-10659Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we propose that the galactose system of E. coli was adapted to function in an environment where galactose levels vary in time. However, the mechanisms of decision suit environments where future galactose levels are unpredictable rather than environments with regular feast and famine cycles. If the galactose system were adapted for the latter kind of environment, with regular fluctuations, we would expect the system to give higher preference to the expression of the MglBAC transport system when the intracellular d-Gal level starts to decrease, thus avoiding the dip in the growth rate at 700 min (Fig. 2A). Transcription of the gal regulon promoters (at any given time point in the experiment, shown in Fig. 1) depends on (i) the availability of resources for transcription, (ii) combinations of the intracellular cAMP and d-Gal levels, (iii) the concentration of regulators sensing these signals, and (iv) the structure and function of the regulatory region and the promoter. Previously, we described how transcription of the gal regulon promoters depends on cAMP and d-galactose concentrations and found that integration of the two signals at the promoters resembles Boolean logic functions (6Semsey S. Krishna S. Sneppen K. Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Krishna S. Orosz L. Sneppen K. Adhya S. Semsey S. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we found a correlation between the shapes of the scaled promoter activity curves (Fig. 3, gray lines) and the logic of signal integration at the promoters. We observed one activity peak in the case of the “d-Gal” and the “NOT cAMP” logic and two activity peaks in the case of AND-like gates (Fig. 3). However, the positions of the peaks in the latter case depend on the strength of GalR/GalS- and cAMP-CRP-binding sites in the regulatory regions. For example, for PgalP, which has the strongest GalR-binding sites and the highest sensitivity to cAMP-CRP activation, the second peak appears earlier compared with PgalS, which needs much higher cAMP-CRP levels to become activated and less d-Gal to lift GalR/GalS-mediated repression.

In the absence of ferrichrome, Arn1p is sorted directly from the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network to the vacuolar lumen for degradation. In the presence of low levels of ferrichrome, the siderophore binds to a receptor domain on Arn1, triggering the redistribution of Arn1 to the plasma membrane. When extracellular ferrichrome levels are high, Arn1 cycles between the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles. To further understand the mechanisms of trafficking of Arn1p, we screened 4580 viable yeast deletion mutants for mislocalization of Arn1-GFP using synthetic genetic array technology.

https://openalex.org/W2077672597,"Molecular selection, ion exclusion, and water permeation are well known regulatory mechanisms in aquaporin. Water permeability was found to be diverse in different subgroups of plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), even though the residues surrounding the water holes remained the same across the subgroups. Upon homology modeling and structural comparison, a conserved Ala/Ile(Val) residue difference was identified in helix 2 that affected the conformation of the NPA region and consequently influenced the water permeability. The residue difference was found to be conservative within the two subgroups of PIPs in rice as well as in other plants. Functional tests further confirmed the prediction via site-directed mutagenesis where replacement of Ala(103) or Ala(102) in respective OsPIP1;1 or OsPIP1;3 with Val yielded 7.0- and 2.2-fold increases in water transportation, and substitution of Ile(98) or Val(95) in respective OsPIP2;3 or OsPIP2;7 with Ala resulted in 73 or 52% reduction of water transportation. Based on structural analyses and molecular dynamics simulations, we proposed that the difference in water permeability was attributed to the orientation variations of helix 2 that modified water-water and water-protein interactions."
