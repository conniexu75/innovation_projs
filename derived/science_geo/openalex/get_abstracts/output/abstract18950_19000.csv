https://openalex.org/W2006200729,"A theoretical framework is proposed to understand binocular visual surface perception based on the idea of a mobile observer sampling images from random vantage points in space. Application of the generic sampling principle indicates that the visual system acts as if it were viewing surface layouts from generic not accidental vantage points. Through the observer's experience of optical sampling, which can be characterized geometrically, the visual system makes associative connections between images and surfaces, passively internalizing the conditional probabilities of image sampling from surfaces. This in turn enables the visual system to determine which surface a given image most strongly indicates. Thus, visual surface perception can be considered as inverse ecological optics based on learning through ecological optics. As such, it is formally equivalent to a degenerate form of Bayesian inference where prior probabilities are neglected."

https://openalex.org/W1542095362,"Abstract An oligonucleosome 12-mer was reconstituted in the absence of linker histones, onto a DNA template consisting of 12 tandemly arranged 208-base pair fragments of the 5 S rRNA gene from the sea urchin Ly-techinus variegatus (Simpson, R. T., Thoma, F. S., and Burbaker, J. M. (1985) Cell 42, 799-808). The ionic strength-dependent folding of this nucleohistone complex was compared with that of a native oligonucleosome fraction obtained from chicken erythrocyte chromatin, which had been carefully stripped of linker histones and fractionated in sucrose gradients. The DNA of this native fraction exhibited a narrow size distribution centered around the length of the 208-12 DNA template used in the reconstituted complex. These two complexes displayed very similar hydrodynamic behavior as judged by sedimentation velocity analysis. By combining these data with electron microscopy analysis, it was shown that the salt-dependent folding of oligonucleosomes in the absence of linker histones involves the bending of the linker DNA region connecting adjacent nucleosomes. It was also found that selective removal by trypsin of the N-terminal regions (tails) of the core histones prevents the oligonucleosome chains from folding. Thus, in the absence of these histone domains, the bending of the linker DNA necessary to bring the nucleosomes in contact is completely abolished. In addition to the complete lack of folding, removal of the histone tails results in an unwinding at low salt of a 20-base pair region at each flanking side of the nucleosome core particle. The possible functional relevance of these results is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1546595715,"The crystal structure of a catalytically active fragment of glucoamylase-I from Aspergillus awamori var. X100 has been determined to a resolution of 2.2 A. Twelve of its 13 alpha-helices are arranged into an An inner core of six mutually parallel alpha-helices are connected to each other through a peripheral set of six alpha-helices. The peripheral helices are parallel to each other, but approximately antiparallel to the inner core of alpha-helices. The putative active site lies in the packing void of the inner set of helices. The last 30 residues of the enzyme comprise a separate domain containing 10 sites of O-glycosylation. Each instance of O-glycosylation involves a serine or threonine side chain linked to the alpha-anomer of a single mannosyl residue. The O-glycosylated domain is in an extended conformation, wrapping around the waist of the alpha/alpha-barrel. Two additional sites of N-glycosylation contribute well ordered glycosyl chains that lie in proximity to the belt of O-glycosylation. The model developed for glucoamylase is a rare and valuable structural example of a glycoprotein and an exo-acting amylolytic enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1572954385,"Ras has been thought to be involved in neuronal differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. PC12 cells are immature adrenal chromaffin-like cells which undergo differentiation to sympathetic neuron-like cells in response to nerve growth factor (NGF). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and interleukin (IL)-6 can also induce differentiation of PC12 cells. In this paper, we report that NGF, FGF, and IL-6 induce an accumulation of an active Ras.GTP complex. In the serum-starved culture of PC12 cells, 6% of the Ras protein was complexed with GTP. Upon stimulation with NGF, the percentage of Ras.GTP increased to 24% after 2 min, and the high level of Ras.GTP was maintained for at least 16 h. On the other hand, the activation of Ras by FGF and IL-6 showed distinct kinetics; about 3-fold increase of Ras.GTP was detected at 10 min, and afterward, the level returned to the basal level within 60 min. These observations provide direct evidence that activation of Ras is involved in signal transduction from these differentiation factors. In addition, it was found that growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor-I, and a tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), can also activate Ras under the same conditions. A tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitor, genistein, inhibited the increase of Ras.GTP induced by NGF and other factors. On the other hand, down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) by prolonged treatment with TPA, which sufficiently blocked TPA-induced Ras activation, did not abolish the formation of Ras.GTP by NGF. These results suggest that tyrosine kinases rather than PKC play a major role in the NGF-induced activation of Ras in PC12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1583136467,"Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) has been found to occur as latent high molecular weight complexes, with or without an associated component denoted latent TGF-beta 1-binding protein (LTBP). We show here that a human glioblastoma cell line (U-1240 MG) secretes all isoforms of TGF-beta s found in mammalian cells (TGF-beta 1, -beta 2, and -beta 3). Approximately 26% of the secreted TGF-beta is in an active form. Latent TGF-beta s were partially purified from medium conditioned by the U-1240 MG cell line using anion exchange chromatography. Analysis of the different fractions by immunoblotting using antisera against precursor parts of the different TGF-beta isoforms, and against LTBP, revealed that not only TGF-beta 1 but also other isoforms of TGF-beta may occur in high molecular weight forms containing LTBP. In addition, each one of the TGF-beta isoforms occurred in smaller forms not containing LTBP. Interestingly, each of the TGF-beta isoforms was also seen in complexes of about 210 kDa containing associated component(s) distinct from LTBP. These results indicate that each of the different isoforms of TGF-beta is synthesized and secreted by this glioblastoma cell line in several different high molecular weight latent forms; the biological importance of the various latent TGF-beta complexes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1983039871,"The Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), which is used for the overexpression of eukaryotic genes and is being engineered for possible use as a viral insecticide, has a circular, supercoiled genome of approximately 128 kilobases. Despite its widespread use, little is known about the mechanism by which AcMNPV replicates. Evidence is presented in this report that AcMNPV origins of DNA replication are repeated sequences each containing several closely related imperfect palindromes that are present in six regions distributed around the genome. Although AcMNPV infection-dependent plasmid replication was initiated by a single complete palindrome, the amount of replication was substantially increased in plasmids containing six or eight palindromes."
https://openalex.org/W1580615597,"The transbilayer movement of fluorescent and isotopically labeled analogs of phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) from the outer to the inner leaflet (flip) and from the inner to the outer leaflet (flop) of human red blood cells (RBC) was examined. The inward movement of 1-oleoyl-2-(N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-aminocaproyl)- (C6-NBD-), 1-oleoyl-2-(N-(3-(3-[125I]iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionyl)aminocaproyl)- (C6-125I-), or 1-oleoyl-2-(N-(3-3-[125I]iodo-4-azido-phenyl)propionyl)aminocaproyl- (C6-125I-N3-) analogs of PC and PE were relatively slow. In contrast, all analogs of PS and PE analogs containing aminododecanoic acid (C12 lipids) were rapidly transported to the cell's inner leaflet. Analysis of 125I-N3 lipids cross-linked to membrane proteins revealed labeling of 32-kDa Rh polypeptides that was dependent on the lipid's capacity to be transported to the inner leaflet but was independent of lipid species. To investigate whether lipids could also be transported from the inner to the outer leaflet, lipid probes residing exclusively in the inner leaflet were monitored for their appearance in the outer leaflet. Lipid movement could not be detected at 0 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, however, approximately 70% of the PC, 40% of the PE, and 15% of the PS redistributed to the cells outer leaflet, thereby attaining their normal asymmetric distribution. Continuous incubation in the presence of bovine serum albumin depleted the cells of the analogs (t1/2 approximately 1.5 h) in a manner that was independent of lipid species. Similar to the inward movement of aminophospholipids, the outward movement of PC, PE, and PS was ATP-dependent and could be blocked by oxidation of membrane sulfhydryls and by the histidine reagent bromophenacyl bromide. Evidence is presented which suggests that the outward movement of lipids is an intrinsic property of the cells unrelated to compensatory mechanisms due to an imbalance in lipid distribution."
https://openalex.org/W1506350545,"Four DNA-recombinant proteins, corresponding to the DNA-binding domain of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), were phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C (PKC). High-performance liquid chromatography-peptide mapping of 32P-labeled C/EBP indicated the presence of three major 32P-labeled peptides: S299 (P)RDK, AKKS277 (P)VDK, and GAAGLPGPGGS248 (P)LK. Phosphorylation of C/EBP by PKC or M-kinase resulted in an attenuation of binding to a 32P-labeled CCAAT oligodeoxynucleotide. Three other truncated forms of C/EBP, C/EBP87, C/EBP87S-C, and C/EBP60, were studied to define the sites of phosphorylation affecting DNA binding. Phosphorylation of the C/EBP87, containing sites Ser299 and Ser277, and C/EBP60, containing only site Ser299, by PKC also resulted in attenuation of DNA binding. In contrast, phosphorylation of C/EBP87S-C, which retained Ser277 but had a Cys in place of Ser299, had no effect on DNA binding. Ser299 could not be phosphorylated by PKC if the protein is already bound to specific DNA. Phosphorylation of intact C/EBP from liver nuclear extract by PKC or M-kinase occurred at Ser299 and Ser277 and at an additional site, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and peptide mapping."
https://openalex.org/W62346892,"Abstract The biochemical nature of endogenous interleukin-6 (IL-6) as it exists in human serum or plasma was investigated. Serum from a patient following bone marrow (BM) transplantation and fresh plasma samples from patients with epidermolysis bullosa or psoriasis, as well as from normal volunteers, were fractionated through G-200 columns and each of the eluted fractions assayed for IL (interleukin)-6 content using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on the monoclonal antibody (mAb) pairs IG61/5IL6 or 4IL6/5IL6 and in the B9 hybridoma growth factor bioassay. The IG61/5IL6 ELISA and the B9 assay detected IL-6 in BM serum almost exclusively of molecular mass approximately 20 kDa. In contrast, the 4IL6/5IL6 ELISA detected strong IL-6 immunoreactivity in complexes of size 100-150 and 400-500 kDa. IL-6 present in the 100-150- and 400-500-kDa complexes was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography through a 5IL6 mAb column. The 5IL6 mAb immunoaffinity column eluate of the respective pools from BM serum contained IL-6 at concentrations approaching 1 microgram/ml as characterized by Western blotting. Sufficient IL-6 and proteins were purified by 5IL6 mAb immunoaffinity column chromatography of the 100-150-kDa complex from 0.8 ml of BM serum to allow (i) verification of three of the polypeptides as IL-6 by amino-terminal sequencing (estimate of IL-6 in original serum sample: 5-10 micrograms/ml), (ii) identification by amino acid sequencing of the associated proteins as complement factor C3b (carboxyl-terminal of the alpha-chain), complement factor C4b (gamma-chain), C-reactive protein, and albumin, and (iii) detection of an associated polypeptide consistent with the soluble IL-6 receptor. Taken together, these data establish that IL-6 is present at unexpectedly high concentrations in human blood in novel biochemical complexes that include other plasma proteins, which in turn, can camouflage IL-6 immunoreactivity and bioactivity as measured in conventional assays."
https://openalex.org/W1634449047,"An NAD-dependent rat liver cytosolic dehydrogenase accepted as substrate retinal generated in situ by microsomes from retinol bound to excess CRBP (cellular retinol binding protein, type I). This activity, which was not retained by anion-exchange chromatography at pH 9.15, was designated P1. P1 activity increased 2.5-fold, with no statistically significant change in its K or Hill coefficient, in liver cytosol from rats fed a retinoid-deficient diet. Orally dosed retinoic acid partially suppressed the increase. Activities chromatographically similar to hepatic P1 were observed in cytosols from rat kidney and testes. P1, purified from rat liver cytosol, had a pI of approximately 8.3, migrated as a tetramer (214 kDa) on a Sephadex G-200 column, and had a subunit molecular mass of 55 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. With free retinal it catalyzed a maximum rate of retinoic acid synthesis of 265 nmol/min/mg of protein and exhibited allosteric kinetics with a K of 0.76 +/- 0.35 microM and a Hill coefficient of 1.5 +/- 0.13 (mean +/- S.D., n = 4). Substrate inhibition was noted with retinal concentrations greater than 6 microM. The purified enzyme not only recognized retinal generated by microsomes as substrate, but also recognized retinal bound to CRBP. The rates of retinoic acid synthesis from CRBP-retinal, with a series of increasing apoCRBP concentrations, exceeded the rates that would be supported by the free retinal present. The CRBP-retinal complex exhibited allosteric kinetics (K, 0.13 microM; Hill coefficient, 1.75; averages of duplicates) in the presence of excess apoCRBP (the ratio total CRBP/total retinal at each concentration of retinal was 2). This enzyme is likely to play a significant role in retinoic acid synthesis in vivo, because it participates in the synthesis of retinoic acid from a physiologically occurring form of retinol (holoCRBP), reflects retinoid status, and is distributed in extrahepatic tissues in addition to liver. These results also suggest a novel role for CRBP in retinoid metabolism, facilitating the conversion of retinal into retinoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1597493507,"Synthetic peptides derived from the type I repeats of human platelet thrombospondin containing a consensus sequence Trp-Ser-Xaa-Trp bind to heparin, promote cell adhesion, and inhibit heparin-dependent interactions of melanoma cells with extracellular matrix components (Guo, N. H., Krutzsch, H. C., Negre, E., Vogel, T., Blake, D. A., and Roberts, D. D. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 3040-3044). In the present study, we further examined the structural requirements for activity of these peptides. The minimal active sequence for heparin or sulfatide binding based on inhibition studies is Trp-Ser-Pro-Trp, although an octapeptide is required for optimal activity. The 2 Trp residues and the Ser residue are essential. Peptides with more than 2 residues between the Trp residues are inactive. The Pro residue is essential for activity of the pentapeptide Trp-Ser-Pro-Trp-Ser, but some larger peptides with substitutions for the Pro residue are active. For direct high affinity binding to heparin, both the consensus sequence and a flanking sequence of basic amino acids are essential. Peptides containing the consensus sequence promote cell adhesion and act cooperatively with the adjacent basic amino acid sequence to promote cell spreading. Chemical modification of the Trp residues in the peptides with amino-terminal basic amino acids abolished both cell adhesion and heparin-binding. Peptides containing the consensus sequence and basic amino acids are chemotactic for A2058 human melanoma cells. The functional importance of this novel heparin and sulfatide-binding motif is suggested by its conservation in other members of the thrombospondin gene family, complement components, and in many members of the cytokine receptor and transforming growth factor beta superfamilies."
https://openalex.org/W1600284253,"The first event leading to the activation of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system is the surface-dependent conversion of factor XII to an active enzyme. Factor XII autoactivation was investigated using dextran sulfate as a soluble activating surface, and the significance of aggregation and the nature of the conformational change were examined by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy, fluorescence and circular dichroism. Results indicate that DS500 (500-kDa dextran sulfate) induces aggregation of factor XII. Analysis of the binding data suggests that 165-192 factor XII molecules can bind to one DS500 chain, while a 1:1 stoichiometry is observed with 5-kDa dextran sulfate. The interaction of factor XII and dextran sulfate is a biphasic process. It is initiated by a fast contraction of the molecule upon binding, as revealed by an apparent increase in organized secondary structures, and then followed by a slow relaxation process during cleavage and subsequent activation. Overall, the results are consistent with a model in which factor XII undergoes conformational changes upon binding to the activating surface. The rapidity of autoactivation in the presence of DS500, as opposed to 5-kDa dextran sulfate, implies that aggregation provides a special mechanism whereby proteolytic cleavage is accomplished efficiently when factor XII molecules are bound side by side on the DS500 molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1553365749,"Numerous studies have indicated that cytoplasmic intermediate filaments (cIFs) can associate with cellular lipids. To determine if these interactions might have functional consequences, we have studied the lipid metabolism of human SW-13 adrenal tumor cell lines that either contain vimentin-type cIFs (vim+) or lack any detectable cIF network (vim-). Although there were no significant differences in phospholipid or glyceride synthesis, vim- cell lines had elevated levels of cholesterol synthesis and decreased cholesterol esterification, compared with vim+ cells. These differences in cholesterol synthesis and esterification were found to be due to an impaired ability of vim- cells to utilize low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol, although receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL and the capacity of these cells to esterify endogenously produced cholesterol were not affected. Expression of a mouse vimentin cDNA in stably transfected cell lines, derived from vim- cells, restored the capacity of these cells to utilize LDL cholesterol. The uptake and metabolism of [3H]cholesterol linoleate-loaded LDL showed that the impaired ability of vim- cells to esterify LDL cholesterol was not associated with an accumulation of cellular free cholesterol but rather an increase in the appearance of [3H]cholesterol in the culture medium. These studies indicate that in SW-13 cells, the intracellular movement of LDL-derived cholesterol from the lysosome to the site of esterification is a vimentin-dependent process."
https://openalex.org/W1598619382,"Structure-function relationship studies of the m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor have recently identified a series of threonine and tyrosine residues (all located within the hydrophobic receptor core) that are critically involved in acetylcholine binding (Wess, J., Gdula, D., and Brann, M.R. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 3729-3734). To gain further insight into the functional roles of these amino acids, the agonist binding properties of six rat m3 muscarinic receptor point mutants, in which the critical threonine and tyrosine residues had been individually replaced by alanine and phenylalanine, respectively, were studied in greater detail following their transient expression in COS-7 cells. The binding profiles of a series of acetylcholine derivatives suggest that the altered threonine and tyrosine residues are primarily involved in the interaction of the acetylcholine ester moiety with the receptor protein. The two m3 receptor point mutants, Thr234----Ala and Tyr506----Phe, which showed the most pronounced decreases in acetylcholine binding affinities (approximately 40-60-fold as compared with the wild-type receptor), were stably expressed in CHO cells for further functional analysis. Both mutant receptors were found to be severely impaired in their ability to stimulate agonist-dependent phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. Consistent with this observation, acetylcholine binding to the two mutant receptors was not significantly affected by addition of the GTP analog Gpp(NH)p (5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate). Our data suggest that Thr234 and Tyr506 (located within transmembrane domains V and VI, respectively), which are conserved among all muscarinic receptors (m1-m5), may play an important role in agonist-induced muscarinic receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1556712517,"Facilitative glucose transporter isoforms, GLUT1 and GLUT4, have different intracellular distributions despite their very similar structure. In insulin-responsive tissues such as adipose tissues and muscle, GLUT4 protein resides mainly in the intracellular region in a basal condition and is translocated to the plasma membrane upon stimulation of insulin. In contrast, GLUT1 protein was distributed about equally between plasma membranes and low density microsomal membranes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, GLUT1 and GLUT4 were reported to be differentially targeted to the plasma membrane and intracellular region, respectively, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and HepG2 cells. To elucidate the differential intracellular targeting mechanisms, several chimeric glucose transporters in which portions of GLUT4 are replaced with corresponding portions of GLUT1 have been stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy as well as measurement of glucose transport activity revealed that two domains of GLUT4, which are not the NH2- or COOH-terminal domain, determine its targeting to the intracellular vesicles. The first domain contains the consensus sequence of the leucine zipper structure, suggesting that a dimer-forming structure of the glucose transporter might be required for its proper targeting. The other domain contains 28 amino acids, nine of which are different between GLUT1 and GLUT4. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the chimeric transporters containing both of these two domains of GLUT1, only the first domain of GLUT1, and none of the domains, exhibited a different cellular distribution with approximately 65, 30, and 15% of the transporters apparently on the plasma membrane, respectively. The addition of insulin did not alter the apparent cellular distributions of these chimeric transporters. These domains would be specifically recognized by intracellular targeting mechanisms in Chinese hamster ovary cells."
https://openalex.org/W1571749791,"We tested the effect of extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATPo) on the activation of human spermatozoa. ATPo, in a concentration range from 50 microM to 5 mM, induced the acrosome reaction, which, at the optimal concentration of 2.5 mM, was maximal (30-35% of spermatozoa activated) within 60 min of the addition of the nucleotide. At the end of this incubation in the presence of ATPo no decrease in cell motility and viability was observed. Among other purine/pyrimidine nucleotides only the ATP analogue adeny-5'-lyl imidodiphosphate was effective (70% of ATP); a weak (10% of ATP) effect was also observed with CTP and the ATP analogues adenosine 5'-(beta gamma-methylene)triphosphate and adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate). ATPo did not cause Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, nor it caused Ca2+ influx from the extracellular milieu; on the contrary, it caused a clear, albeit slow, plasma membrane depolarization. ATPo-activated spermatozoa showed a nearly 100% success rate in the standard hamster egg fertilization test. Our results describe a new effect of ATPo in human spermatozoa with relevant potential applications in fertility studies."
https://openalex.org/W1580431143,"We sought to determine the cis-acting elements responsible for the pattern of tissue specific expression of the mouse alpha 2(I) collagen gene. Using an RNase protection assay we first verified that expression of the alpha 2(I) collagen gene is mainly confined to tendons, bone, and skin in mice. Both transgenic mice and DNA transfection of tissue culture cells were used as experimental approaches. Transgenic mice lines were generated harboring chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) chimeric genes that contained either (a) 2000 base pairs (bp) of 5'-flanking sequences of the mouse alpha 2(I) collagen gene plus additional sequences between +418 and +1524 of the first intron of this gene or (b) the same promoter sequences without intron sequences or (c) the 350-bp proximal promoter sequences. Transgenic mice containing both types of 2000-bp promoters showed a pattern of CAT expression that was tissue specific. The presence of sequences of the first intron in the transgene did not increase the level of promoter activity. Transgenic mice harboring the 350-bp alpha 2(I) collagen promoter also showed a pattern that was tissue-specific except that high level expression also occurred in the brain. This suggests that negative regulation is an important component of tissue-specific expression. In order to analyze the first 350 bases in detail, we performed transient expression experiments, using promoter fragments attached to the luciferase reporter gene. Fibroblasts, which show a high level expression of the endogenous alpha 2(I) collagen gene, and B cells, in which the gene is silent, were transfected with a series of deletions and substitution mutations within the proximal 350-bp promoter. These experiments were unable to define unique cell-specific cis-acting elements. However, when the sequence between -315 and -284 was tandemly repeated upstream of a minimal alpha 2(I) collagen promoter (-41 to +54), the activity of this construction was considerably higher in fibroblasts than in B cells when compared with the minimal promoter itself. In gel retardation assays, the levels of complexes that bind to this sequence were higher in fibroblast nuclear extracts than in myeloma nuclear extracts. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the -315 to -284 DNA sequence participates in the cell-specific control of the alpha 2(I) collagen gene in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1590788894,"Cl.16E, a stably differentiated clonal derivative of the human colonic cancer cell line HT29, was used to investigate the structure of oligosaccharide chains of mucins in colonic cancer. Secretory mucins were purified by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in CsCl. Oligosaccharide side chains were isolated after beta-elimination. Compositional analysis of oligosaccharide-alditols performed after purification by gel filtration on a Bio-gel P-6 column showed 1) that GalNAc residues were located exclusively at the reducing ends of the chains, and 2) that fucose was absent from the preparation. Oligosaccharide-alditols were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on quaternary amine packings into a minor neutral fraction representing about 6.5% by weight of released oligosaccharides and four acidic fractions. Two acidic fractions, namely FI and FII encompassing mono- and disialylated structures, respectively, and containing 78% of total oligosaccharide alditols, were separated by HPLC. Structural determinations were carried out using methylation analysis, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. Twelve oligosaccharide structures were determined which ranged in size from 3 to 8 residues. These oligosaccharides were based on core types 1, 2, and 4. Elongation of oligosaccharide chains was terminated by addition of sialic acid in alpha 2-3 linkage to Gal beta 1-3R and to Gal beta 1-4R residues. The predominant structure was a hexasaccharide (fraction FII-4). This contrasts with normal colonic mucins whose oligosaccharides were previously found to be based on core 3 structures and carry sialic acids in alpha (2-6) linkage to Gal beta 1-3R, to Gal beta 1-4R, and to GalNAc alpha-R (Podolsky, D.K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 8262-8271; Podolsky, D.K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15510-15515). Collectively our findings suggest that Cl.16E colon cancer cells are able to synthesize mucin oligosaccharides of gastric type whose elongation is truncated by premature sialylation."
https://openalex.org/W1528690306,"It has been suggested that hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles may be relevant to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and that at least one of the hyperphosphorylated sites lies within a consensus sequence for the p34cdc2/cdc28 family of kinases. We describe a new method for large-scale purification of p34cdc28 kinase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and show that the purified enzyme can phosphorylate bovine and human tau. Phosphorylation was greatly enhanced by the addition of basic and acidic substrate modulators. The effect of the substrate modulators differed both with the structures of the substrates and the modulators. Similar results were obtained with a kinase that could be purified from neurofilaments by p13suc1 affinity chromatography, a hallmark of p34cdc2/cdc28-type kinases. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a kinase of this type is involved in tau phosphorylation in vivo and open the possibility that hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease may be controlled by substrate modulators."
https://openalex.org/W1480907902,"The mutational potency of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites induced by heat-treatment under acidic conditions has been studied in mammalian cells. Abasic sites were induced on a single-stranded DNA shuttle vector carrying the supF tRNA gene, eliminating, therefore, any ambiguity concerning the damaged strand. This vector was able to replicate both in mammalian cells and in bacteria where the mutations induced in animal cells on the supF tRNA gene were screened by the white/blue beta-galactosidase assay in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-beta-D-galactoside. All white colonies contained plasmid with a mutation on the target gene which was directly sequenced. Our results show that one AP site was induced/22 min of heating as measured by sensitivity of DNA to alkali denaturation or treatment with the AP-endonuclease activity of the FPG protein (Fapy-DNA glycosylase). Putative AP sites decrease survival of the plasmid with a lethal hit of one AP site/single-stranded molecule. Mutation frequency was increased by a factor of approximately six after 2 h at 70 degrees C. Most of the induced mutations were point mutations not distributed at random and clustered in the gene region which will give rise to the mature tRNA. Mutations were abolished by treatments that eliminated AP sites such as alkali treatment or incubation with the Fapy-DNA glycosylase protein. Under our experimental conditions, when only single mutations were taken into account, the order of base insertion opposite AP sites was G greater than A greater than T greater than C."
https://openalex.org/W3141642568,"Phi 29 DNA polymerase shares with other alpha-like DNA polymerases several regions of amino acid similarity. Among them, the two conserved regions characterized by the amino acid motifs D-NSLYP and K--NS(L/V)YG, regions 1 and 2a, respectively, according to Blanco et al. (Blanco, L., Bernad, A., Blasco, M. A. and Salas, M. (1991) Gene (Amst.) 100, 27-38) have been proposed to be part of the polymerization active site of alpha-like DNA polymerases. One phi 29 DNA polymerase mutant in residue Tyr254, located in conserved region 1, and two mutants in residue Tyr390, located in conserved region 2a, have been characterized. The three phi 29 DNA polymerase mutant proteins were affected in polymerization when Mg(2+)-dNTPs were used as substrate. However, when the substrate was Mn(2+)-dNTP, mutants behaved as the wild-type phi 29 DNA polymerase. Mutant Tyr254 to Phe (Y254F) was strongly affected in the protein-primed initiation step of phi 29 DNA replication showing a decreased affinity for Me(2+)-dATP, the initiating nucleotide. Furthermore, the analysis of the template-independent deoxynucleotidylation of the TP by Y254F mutant polymerase is consistent with a change in the relative affinity for dNTPs. On the other hand, mutants Y390F and Y390S were found to be hypersensitive to the dNTP analogs 2-(p-n-butylanilino)dATP and N2-(p-n-butyl-phenyl)dGTP. The results obtained indicate that residues Tyr254 and Tyr390 are involved, directly or indirectly, in Me(2+)-dNTP binding."
https://openalex.org/W1486610254,"Synthesis of a labile selenium donor compound, selenophosphate, from selenide and ATP by the Escherichia coli SELD enzyme was reported previously from this laboratory. From the gene sequence, SELD is a 37-kDa protein that contains 7 cysteine residues, 2 of which are located at positions 17 and 19 in the sequence -Gly-Ala-Cys-Gly-Cys-Lys-Ile- (Leinfelder, W., Forchhammer, K., Veprek, B., Zehelein, E., and Bock, A. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 73, 543-547). Inactivation of the enzyme by alkylation with iodoacetamide indicated that at least 1 cysteine residue in the protein is essential for enzyme activity. To test the possibility that the Cys17 and/or Cys19 residue might be essential, these were changed to serine residues by site-specific mutagenesis. The biological activities of the wild type and mutant proteins were studied using E. coli MB08 (selD-) transformed with plasmids containing the selD genes. The plasmid containing the Cys17-mutated gene failed to complement MB08, whereas the Cys19-mutated gene was indistinguishable from wild type. The mutant proteins, like the wild type enzyme, bound to an ATP-agarose matrix, showing that their affinities for ATP were unimpaired. Selenide-dependent formation of AMP from ATP was abolished by mutation of Cys17, but the Cys19 mutation had no effect on the ability of the enzyme to catalyze the reaction. These results indicate that Cys17 has an essential role in the catalytic process that leads to the formation of selenophosphate from ATP and selenide."
https://openalex.org/W1592651055,"Human protein C (HPC) undergoes several post-translational modifications, including gamma-carboxylation, N-linked glycosylation, and internal proteolytic processing. We have utilized a recombinant human kidney cell line (293) secreting correctly modified HPC (rHPC) to study the processing reactions for the modification of this complex protein. gamma-Carboxylation was shown to proceed via a vitamin K-dependent pathway and was required for both efficient secretion and anticoagulant activity. rHPC was rapidly secreted following the addition of vitamin K to depleted cells, and secretion was not inhibited by cyclohexamide indicating that non gamma-carboxylated rHPC accumulates as an intracellular releasable pool. However, in cells grown in the presence of vitamin K, the majority of intracellular rHPC was gamma-carboxylated, suggesting that this post-translational modification is not rate limiting for secretion under conditions optimal for vitamin K-dependent carboxylation. Nonglycosylated rHPC was found to be secreted inefficiently, and processing of the N-linked core in the endoplasmic reticulum, but not in the Golgi, was required for secretion. Further, the intracellular rHPC present in vitamin K-supplemented cells was core glycosylated, but not processed past the high mannose step. gamma-Carboxylation occurred after core glycosylation, indicating that this modification is not cotranslational. Further, glycosylation and gamma-carboxylation were not coupled and did not need to proceed sequentially. Proteolytic processing of the internal KR dipeptide was found to occur late in the secretion pathway, and the cleavage was calcium-dependent. The secretion rate of rHPC was also calcium-dependent but was independent of the calcium effect on internal KR dipeptide removal, indicating that cleavage is not required for efficient secretion. Our results define the sequence of processing events, the subcellular localization of the processing reactions, and the rate-limiting steps in the secretion pathway for this complex protein."
https://openalex.org/W1582780353,"Monoclonal antibodies to the transferrin receptor or to the T cell antigen, CD5, were chemically linked to mammalian RNase A and found to specifically inhibit protein synthesis in antigen-positive cells. Antibody-mediated specificity of these cytotoxic ribonuclease chimeras (CRCs) was demonstrated in three ways. 1) Toxicity was due to the chemical linkage of RNase to antibody, as the individual components added separately or in combination did not inhibit protein synthesis; 2) the anti-transferrin receptor CRCs inhibited protein synthesis in those cells expressing the human transferrin receptor (K562, U251, Jurkat cells) but had no detectable toxicity to cells lacking the human transferrin receptor (Vero or NIH 3T3 cells); 3) free antibody to either the human transferrin receptor (454A12 or 5E-9) or to the T cell antigen, CD5 (T101), blocked the cytotoxicity of the respective CRC. Two CRC species, designated P1 and P2, that differed in size and stoichiometry of RNase A to antibody, were purified by size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography. The higher molecular weight P1 conjugate had an IC50 of 20-30 nM, whereas the P2 conjugate had a higher IC50 of 300-500 nM. Bioactivity could be reversibly increased more than 10-fold by freezing. The cytotoxicity of the CRCs was examined in vivo in a solid tumor animal model. Intratumoral injections of an anti-transferrin receptor CRC into established U251 human glioblastoma tumors grown in the flanks of nude mice prevented tumor growth, whereas RNase A mixed with antibody was ineffective. CRCs, therefore, express cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Mammalian nucleases coupled to antibodies may be utilized as cell type-selective cytotoxins and have potential as pharmacologic reagents. The systemic toxicity and immunogenicity observed with mammalian derived cytotoxins may be significantly less than that of the currently employed plant- and bacterial-derived immunotoxins."
https://openalex.org/W1917582797,"Domains homologous to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) are important building blocks for extracellular proteins. Proteins containing these domains have been shown to function in such diverse biological processes as blood coagulation, complement activation, and the developmental determination of embryonic cell fates. Many of these proteins require calcium for their biological function. In the case of coagulation factors IX and X and anticoagulants proteins C and S, calcium has been found to bind to the EGF-like domains. We have now determined the three-dimensional structure of the calcium-bound form of the NH2-terminal EGF-like domain in coagulation factor X by two-dimensional NMR and simulated folding. Ligands to the calcium ion are the two backbone carbonyls in Gly-47 and Gly-64, as well as the side chains in Gln-49, erythro-beta-hydroxyaspartic acid (Hya) 63, and possibly Asp-46. The conserved Asp-48 is not a ligand in our present structures. The remaining ligands are assumed to be solvent molecules or, in the intact protein, ligands from neighboring domains. Other proteins interacting in a calcium-dependent manner may also contribute ligands. A comparison with the calcium-free form shows that calcium binding induces strictly local structural changes in the domain. Residues corresponding to the side chain ligands in factor X are conserved in many other proteins, such as the integral membrane protein TAN-1 of human lymphocytes and its developmentally important homolog, Notch, in Drosophila. Calcium binding to EGF-like domains may be crucial for numerous protein-protein interactions involving EGF-like domains in coagulation factors, plasma proteins, and membrane proteins. Therefore, there is reason to believe that this novel calcium site plays an important role in the biochemistry of extracellular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1498522374,"Cytochrome P-450-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism in chick embryo liver microsomes was increased by both Ah receptor-dependent (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and beta-naphthoflavone) and independent (phenobarbital) P-450 inducers. Arachidonic acid epoxides and monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids were increased 9-12-fold. omega-1-OH arachidonic acid was also significantly increased by TCDD and beta-naphthoflavone while omega-OH arachidonic acid, the main metabolite in uninduced livers, was decreased by all three agents. The P-450s catalyzing the enhanced arachidonate metabolism in beta-naphthoflavone- and phenobarbital-treated liver were investigated in reconstituted systems containing wholly or partially purified P-450s. beta-Naphthoflavone induced formation of a 55-kDa P-450 selective for arachidonate metabolism and for epoxygenation in particular. This P-450 was purified (beta NFAA). It was found to be distinct from a 54.5-kDa beta-naphthoflavone-induced P-450 catalyzing aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and 7-ethoxyresorufin deethylase (designated NF1). Mean turnover numbers for arachidonate epoxygenase, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, and 7-ethoxyresorufin deethylase were 11.2, 0.56, and 0.04, respectively, for reconstituted beta NFAA and 0.33, 11.8, and 2.4 for NF1. beta NFAA and NF1 also differed in chromatography elution characteristics and N-terminal amino acid sequences. Both were low spin, with carbon monoxide binding peaks at 448 nm. The phenobarbital-induced arachidonate epoxygenation was catalyzed by P-450 fractions containing the main 48- and 49-kDa phenobarbital-induced P-450s; fractions in which the 49-kDa P-450 predominated were the most active. Turnover numbers for arachidonic acid epoxygenation were not correlated with those for aminopyrine demethylation or 7-ethoxycoumarin deethylation for P-450s from phenobarbital-treated livers or with aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, 7-ethoxyresorufin deethylase, or 7-ethoxycoumarin deethylase for P-450s from beta-naphthoflavone-treated livers. Also, different P-450s catalyzed the epoxygenation and the omega-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid in both beta-naphthoflavone- and phenobarbital-treated livers. The findings support a physiologic role for P-450-induced arachidonate metabolism and provide a basis for a possible link between TCDD's induction of P-450 and alterations of cellular homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1531209836,"The c-myb protooncogene, which is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle, encodes a transcriptional activator that functions via DNA binding. The regulatory mechanisms governing this specific pattern of expression are not fully understood, although human c-myb expression appears to be positively autoregulated via myb-binding sites in the 5'-flanking region of the c-myb gene (Nicolaides, N. C., Gualdi, R., Casadevall, C., Manzella, L., and Calabretta, B. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 6166-6176). To determine the contribution of other transcription regulators such as JUN family members in the control of c-myb expression, transient expression assays were carried out which revealed a 6- to a 15-fold enhancement by c-Jun and JunD, but not JunB, in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene expression driven by different segments of the human c-myb 5'-flanking region. An Ap1-like element located at nucleotide -149 from the c-myb initiation site appears to be required for this transactivation upon binding to a nuclear protein complex containing c-Jun and JunD, since site-directed mutations of this Ap1-like element abolished c-Jun and JunD binding and transactivation. Exposure of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells to c-jun and junD antisense oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in a 46 and 43% inhibition of T-lymphocyte proliferation that was accompanied by a decrease in c-myb mRNA levels as compared with sense-treated cultures. Because T-lymphocytes induced to proliferate express c-jun and junD before c-myb, these data suggest a mechanism whereby c-Jun and JunD contribute to the transcriptional activation of c-myb that, in turn, is maintained at the G1/S transition and during S phase by positive autoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2125055475,Heparan sulfate isolated from bovine arterial tissue by a multistep purification procedure or from arterial tissue proteoheparan sulfate by beta-elimination exhibits antiproliferative activity toward arterial smooth muscle cells when added to subconfluent cell cultures in a concentration of 50-100 micrograms/ml medium. Enzymatic disintegration of heparan sulfate by heparitinases I and II and isolation of the resulting oligosaccharides indicate that the antiproliferative activity of the heparan sulfate molecule resides in a sulfate-rich octa/decasaccharide domain which is separated by longer sequences of sulfate-free or sulfate-poor N-acetylglucosamine containing disaccharide units. The octa/decasaccharide fraction has a 3-4-fold higher antiproliferative activity than the native heparan sulfate molecule and contains 45% of a disulfated disaccharide which consists of 2-O-sulfated uronic acid and N-sulfated glucosamine (UA(2S)-GlcNS and 12% of a trisulfated disaccharide (UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S). A sulfate-rich hexasaccharide fraction containing 14% of the disulfated disaccharide but 18% of the trisulfated disaccharide has negligible antiproliferative activity. The results indicate the presence of specific structural determinants in the arterial heparan sulfate molecule which may have the function of an endogenous inhibitor of arterial smooth muscle cell growth.
https://openalex.org/W1593369110,"Long chain cis-prenyltransferase in rat liver microsomes was studied using various allylic isoprenoid substrates. Microsomes could utilize trans-geranyl pyrophosphate, but not cis-geranyl pyrophosphate for polyprenyl pyrophosphate synthesis. Both trans, trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate and trans,cis-farnesyl pyrophosphate were used as substrates with Km values of 24 and 5 microM, respectively. trans,trans,cis-Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate could be used as substrate with an apparent Km of 36 microM. trans,trans,trans-Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate was also utilized as substrate, but with a very low affinity. After pulse labeling for 4 min, using [3H]isopentenyl pyrophosphate and trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate, the only product formed was trans,trans,cis-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which, upon chasing, yielded polyprenyl pyrophosphate. Independent of the nature of the substrate used, even in the case of polyprenyl 12-pyrophosphate and all-trans-nonaprenyl pyrophosphate, the chain lengths of the products were identical, i.e. polyprenyl pyrophosphates with 15-18 isoprene residues. Microsomes were able to synthesize trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate using trans-geranyl pyrophosphate as substrate. The results indicate that rat liver microsomes contain a farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase activity and that the reaction catalyzed by cis-prenyltransferase may consist of two individual steps, i.e. synthesis of trans,trans,cis-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and elongation of this product to long chain polyprenyl pyrophosphates."
https://openalex.org/W1508690395,"Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells differentiate terminally in culture upon exposure to nerve growth factor (NGF) for 4-5 weeks. The neuronal phenotypic properties acquired in response to prolonged NGF treatment include morphological differentiation, cessation of mitotic activity, neuronal marker expression, increased membrane electrical potentials, and a survival dependence upon NGF for trophic support (Jensen, L.M. (1987) Dev. Biol. 120, 56-64). Thus, differentiated cultures survive indefinitely in the continued presence of NGF, however, withdrawal of NGF from differentiated cultures effects the loss of cellular viability within 3-6 days. Here, we show that death of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells caused by NGF deprivation is characteristic of apoptosis. To compare the differentiation promoting and the neurotrophic properties of NGF, whole SH-SY5Y cell extracts were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using isoelectric focusing and nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis gels in the first dimension. Steady-state levels of polypeptides extracted from whole-cell lysates of naive (untreated) cells, terminally differentiated cells, and NGF-deprived differentiated cells were compared. Over 1,000 spots from each were analyzed using computer-aided spot matching and densitometry. We noted 25 polypeptides that decreased during differentiation, including 15 that decreased by a factor of 10 or more. The levels of five polypeptides were induced from very low or undetectable levels in naive cells. Withdrawal of NGF from terminally differentiated cells produced alterations in steady-state protein patterns substantially distinct from those occurring during differentiation. While levels of most proteins do not appear affected early after NGF withdrawal, others rapidly return to levels comparable with those of the naive state and some changes occurring with differentiation are enhanced further upon NGF withdrawal. Three polypeptides were regulated uniquely by NGF withdrawal, including two that were induced, on average, 20- and 28-fold and another that was depressed more than 7-fold after NGF deprivation, before cell death. These data indicate that NGF elicits both constitutive and nonconstitutive changes in gene expression and suggest that the differentiation promoting and the neurotrophic properties of NGF correlate with the regulation of different gene products."
https://openalex.org/W1599791669,"rho-Independent transcription terminators in Escherichia coli contain a dG+dC-rich dyad-symmetrical structure that encodes an RNA hairpin structure and an adjacent, downstream dA+dT-rich region which encodes uridines at the 3'-end of the transcript. In the threonine (thr) attenuator, there are at least six sequence segments in the DNA that might affect termination: the sequence upstream of the attenuator, the deoxythymidine-rich stretch immediately preceding the G+C-rich region, the G+C-rich region itself and its hairpin loop-encoding region, the deoxyadenosine tract following the G+C-rich region, and the following downstream sequence. Our previous studies (Jeng, S.-T., Gardner, J.F., and Gumport, R.I. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3823-3830) indicate that both the stability and sequence of the RNA hairpin formed by the G+C-rich region and the length of the uridine tract encoded by the deoxyadenosine stretch influence the termination of T7 RNA polymerase in vitro. In this report, we demonstrate that the template deoxythymidine run upstream of the G+C-rich region, the loop-encoding segment, and the sequences upstream and downstream of the thr attenuator also affect termination. These results indicate that: 1) a deoxythymidine tract is not absolutely required for termination, but increasing the number of deoxythymidines from one to nine base pairs causes T7 RNA polymerase to terminate more efficiently; 2) a template with the natural loop sequence reversed results in a higher termination efficiency than one encoded by the the wild-type attenuator; 3) the termination of T7 RNA polymerase is affected by sequences both proximal and distal to the thr attenuator."
https://openalex.org/W1579830068,"The Escherichia coli mannitol permease is an integral membrane protein that catalyzes the concomitant transport and phosphorylation of D-mannitol and also acts as the chemoreceptor for chemotaxis of E. coli to this hexitol. At least 4 aminoacyl residues in this protein have been suggested to be important in these activities: His-195, His-256, Cys-384, and His-554. Previous evidence has implicated His-554 and Cys-384 as residues that are covalently phosphorylated, in sequence, as intermediates in phosphotransfer to mannitol. We have constructed a number of site-specific mutants of the mannitol permease at these positions. The properties of proteins in which His-554 or Cys-384 has been changed are consistent with their essential roles in phosphorylation. We also used these mutants to show that intermolecular phosphotransfer between His-554 and Cys-384 can occur in vivo in membrane-bound heterodimers consisting of different mutant subunits. The properties of proteins with mutations at position 195 suggest an important role for this residue involving hydrogen bonding, while His-256 performs no significant function in the mannitol permease. Finally, the phosphorylation and chemoreception activities for each mutant protein were each roughly in the same proportion to these activities in the wild-type protein, showing that these functions of the mannitol permease are tightly coupled under normal physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2133984296,"Organometals, including organomercurials, are capable of mediating Cl-/OH- exchange across lipid membranes by forming neutral ion pairs. In this study, the ability of inorganic metals to catalyze Cl-/OH- exchange was examined. In the presence of an inwardly directed chloride gradient, HgCl2 at concentrations as low as 30 nM resulted in quenching of acridine orange fluorescence in liposomes, indicating liposomal acidification. In the presence of the reducing agent, ascorbate, CuSO4 at concentrations as low as 0.6 microM also mediated chloride-dependent liposomal acidification. Copper in the absence of ascorbate, iron (with or without ascorbate), cobalt, cadmium, zinc, nickel, and lead were without an effect. 36Cl efflux from rabbit renal brush border membrane vesicles was also markedly stimulated by micromolar concentrations of mercury or copper plus ascorbate. Vesicle integrity was not altered by the concentrations of mercury or copper employed in these studies. In the absence of ascorbate, CuCl stimulated chloride efflux only under anaerobic conditions, confirming that it is the reduced form of copper (Cu+) that mediates chloride transport across the membrane. In the presence of mercury or reduced copper, an inside alkaline pH gradient stimulated the uphill accumulation of 36Cl and 82Br, respectively, confirming Cl-/OH- exchange. Studies in liposomes and brush border membranes demonstrate that this is an electroneutral process. These results show that Hg2+ and Cu+ are capable of acting as ionophores, mediating electroneutral Cl-/OH- exchange in liposomes and brush border membrane vesicles. This effect could contribute to the toxicity of these two metals."
https://openalex.org/W1545086014,"The effect of the base composition of flanking sequences on DNA intramolecular triplex formation was investigated in negatively supercoiled plasmids. The rates of triplex formation at two oligopurine.oligopyrimidine inserts with interrupting sequences in plasmids containing AT- or GC-rich flanking sequences were compared as a function of temperature, pH, and negative superhelical density. The kinetics of the transition of linear B-DNA to triplex (also called H-DNA) were influenced by all of these factors; triplexes were formed slower in a GC-rich background than in an AT-rich background. However, at equilibrium, the same amounts of the triplexes in AT- or GC-rich contexts were formed, and the conformations adopted by (GAA)4TTCGC(GAA)4 showed the canonical intramolecular triplex as mapped with chemical probes. We propose that the GC-rich segments caused this effect by thermodynamically clamping the DNA inserts, since the dependence of kinetics on base composition disappeared in tetraalkylammonium ions which eliminate the dependence of helix-coil transitions on base composition. The dependence of the kinetics of intramolecular triplex formation on flanking sequences further strengthens the concept of the role of DNA as a dynamic participant in cellular events."
https://openalex.org/W1595231167,"An endoproteolytic activity that specifically cleaves CCK 33, producing CCK 8, has been purified from a rat brain synaptosome preparation. The purification, which included anion exchange, chromatofocusing, hydroxyapatite, and gel filtration chromatography, resulted in a greater than 3000-fold increase in specific activity. This neutral endoprotease (pH optimum 8) exists as a 90-kDa species, which can be dissociated into active 40-kDa species. The enzyme is a non-trypsin serine protease, which is inhibited by diisopropyl-fluorophosphate and p-aminobenzamidine but not by soybean trypsin inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, or a number of thiol or metalloprotease inhibitors. It is highly substrate-specific and cleaves neither trypsin, enteropeptidase, kallikrein substrates, nor analogues of mono- or dibasic cleavage sites of prohormones other than pro-CCK. The endoprotease will not cleave CCK 12 desulfate or CCK (20-29), although these peptides contain common sequences with CCK-33. The protease does cleave [Glu27]CCK (20-29), a peptide in which the glutamate mimics the negative charge normally present on tyrosine sulfate. This suggests that the negative charge at position 27 is important in substrate recognition. The enzyme will also cleave CCK 33 and CCK (1-21) on the carboxyl-terminal side of a single lysine residue in position 11. The subcellular location and specificity of this endoprotease make it a good candidate for a CCK-processing protease."
https://openalex.org/W1511206323,"dnaB protein of Escherichia coli is an essential replication protein. A missense mutant has been obtained which results in replacement of an arginine residue with cysteine at position 231 of the protein (P. Shrimankar, L. Shortle, and R. Maurer, unpublished data). This mutant displays a dominant-lethal phenotype in strains that are heterodiploid for dnaB. Biochemical analysis of the altered form of dnaB protein revealed that it was inactive in replication in several purified enzyme systems which involve specific and nonspecific primer formation on single-stranded DNAs, and in replication of plasmids containing the E. coli chromosomal origin. Inactivity in replication appeared to be due to its inability to bind to single-stranded DNA. The altered dnaB protein was inhibitory to the activity of wild type dnaB protein in replication by sequestering dnaC protein which is also required for replication. By contrast, it was not inhibitory to dnaB protein in priming of single-stranded DNA by primase in the absence of single-stranded DNA binding protein. Sequestering of dnaC protein into inactive complexes may relate to the dominant-lethal phenotype of this dnaB mutant."
https://openalex.org/W1576690949,"Connective tissue activating peptide-III (CTAP-III) is a component of platelet alpha-granules which elicits a series of responses in connective tissue cells referred to as activation, including increased glucose consumption and mitogenesis and increased secretion of hyaluronic acid and glycosaminoglycans. As anticipated by a requirement for glucose or glucose precursors in the activation process, an early event following CTAP-III activation of connective tissue cells is an increase in glucose transport. The present study investigates the molecular basis for this increase in glucose transport. Murine 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were found to respond to CTAP-III in a manner similar to human connective tissue cells (synovial cells, chondrocytes, skin fibroblasts). CTAP-III increases the rate of glucose transport to similar extents at 4 and 24 h, and at physiologic (micrograms/ml) concentrations of CTAP-III. A proteolytic cleavage product of recombinant CTAP-III (rCTAP-III-Leu-21 (des-1-15)), also known as neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2), was found to be equally effective as CTAP-III, whereas NAP-1/interleukin-8, another member of the CTAP-III super-family, was ineffective in stimulating glucose transport. This contrasts with neutrophil chemotaxis, in which CTAP-III (des-1-15)/NAP-2 acts similarly to NAP-1/interleukin 8 while CTAP-III is ineffective. CTAP-III appears to elicit a different type of glucose transport response than many other growth factors in that its response is sustained (greater than or equal to 24 h) rather than transient (peak approximately 4 h) in confluent as well as in subconfluent cells. Western blot analysis using antibodies to the GLUT-1 glucose transporter revealed an increased level of GLUT-1 protein in response to CTAP-III isoforms that corresponded in magnitude (on a percentage basis) to the increased level of glucose transport. The increased levels of GLUT-1 protein in response to CTAP-III and rCTAP-III-Leu-21 (des-1-15)/NAP-2 were accompanied by an increase in levels of GLUT-1 mRNA of a magnitude sufficient to account for observed increased levels of GLUT-1. These results are consistent with CTAP-III isoforms stimulating glucose transport in connective tissue cells by increasing levels of GLUT-1 mRNA and is one of the few known instances in which increases in levels of GLUT-1 mRNA and protein are sufficient to account for observed increases in glucose transport. They also provide further evidence that CTAP-III (des-1-15)/NAP-2 binds to more than one type of receptor and that CTAP-III acts in a manner different than other well characterized growth factors (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta) in that it causes a sustained (greater than or equal to 24 h) elevation in glucose transport in confluent as well as subconfluent cells."

The sequence of six tryptic fragments of p18 was identical with subsequences present in mammalian calmodulin. Authentic porcine brain calmodulin and p18 co-migrated on an sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis gel and displayed identical chromatographic behavior on a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography column. The VIP-binding properties of p18 and calmodulin were indistinguishable. Both proteins displayed saturable and apparent high affinity binding of VIP, evidenced by potent inhibition of complexation with [Tyr10-125I]VIP by unlabeled VIP (IC50 = 6.0-8.1 nM). Rat growth hormone releasing factor and a C terminally extended form of VIP ([Leu17]VIP-GKR) also displayed potent inhibition of the binding (IC50 = 6.4 and 4 nM, respectively). These neuropeptides are potential modulators of calmodulin function."
https://openalex.org/W1753221792,"Transcription of the human growth hormone (hGH) gene depends on cis-acting elements contained within 300 base pairs of its 5'-flanking sequence. An earlier in vitro study of the transcriptional activity of this 5'-flanking region suggested that transcription can start upstream from position +1. We have investigated this phenomenon by cell-free transcription and transient transfection of chimeric constructs in cultured pituitary cells and in HeLa cells and by analysis of RNA from human pituitary glands and HeLa cells. Transcription initiation sites were identified at positions -54 and -197 by cell-free transcription assays and by RNAse mapping of human pituitary RNA. In transfection assays, the hGH gene 5'-flanking sequence upstream from position -197 displayed transcriptional activity, which critically depended on the upstream stimulatory factor-binding site located between positions -253 and -266. Transcripts initiated upstream from position +1 were detected in human pituitary RNA by polymerase chain reaction amplification and Northern blotting. These transcripts were longer than the mRNA encoding hGH. They might control initiation at position +1 or code for a novel peptide."

Expression of calpain I, a low Ca(2+)-requiring cysteine protease, was observed in all human T-cell lines tested. By contrast, expression of calpain II, a high Ca(2+)-requiring form, in human T-cells was closely correlated with human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) infection, which is known to result in the expression of adult T-cell leukemia-associated antigens, interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha, and Ca(2+)-dependent cell proliferation. Specific expression of calpain II in HTLV-I-infected cells occurred at the mRNA level. Furthermore, expression of calpain II in human natural killer-like cells was augmented by HTLV-I pX gene transfection. In HTLV-I-infected cells, the trans-acting transcriptional activation of the long terminal repeat and control elements for the IL-2 receptor alpha, c-fos, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor genes by the Tax from the pX gene is already known. Our results suggest that the similar trans-activation occurs to the calpain II gene in HTLV-I-infected hematopoietic system cells."

P., Migliaccio, A., Auricchio, F., and Blasi, F. (1990) FEBS Lett. 266, 109-114). To test the possibility that phosphorylation may have specific effects on urokinase function, the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of urokinase were separated by Fe(3+)-Sepharose chromatography. Both forms exhibit indistinguishable Km and kcat for plasminogen activation. On the other hand, their sensitivity toward the specific plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 is different as assessed by measuring both the stability of the covalent complex and the residual enzymatic activity. Phosphorylated urokinase was 50% inhibited at a concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 4-fold higher than nonphosphorylated urokinase (0.7 versus 0.15 nM). Furthermore about 10% of phosphorylated urokinase was resistant to plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 at a concentration as high as 20 nM. Thus, phosphorylation affects urokinase sensitivity to plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, therefore resulting in a net, although indirect, increase of urokinase activity. These results suggest the existence of a novel cellular regulatory mechanism of extracellular proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1523413318,"The enzyme rhodanese is greatly stabilized in the range pH 4-6, and samples at pH 5 are fully active after several days at 23 degrees C. This is very different from results at pH greater than 7, where there is significant loss of activity within 1 h. A pH-dependent conformational change occurs below pH 4 in a transition centered around pH 3.25 that leads slowly to inactive rhodanese at pH 3 (t 1/2 = 22 min at pH3). The inactive rhodanese can be reactivated by incubation under conditions required for detergent-assisted refolding of denatured rhodanese. The inactive enzyme at pH 3 has the maximum of its intrinsic fluorescence spectrum shifted to 345 nm from 335 nm, which is characteristic of native rhodanese at pH greater than 4. At pH 3, rhodanese shows increased exposure of organized hydrophobic surfaces as measured by 1,1‘-bis(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5‘-disulfonic acid binding. The secondary structure is maintained over the entire pH range studied (pH 2-7). Fluorescence anisotropy measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence provide evidence suggesting that the pH transition produces a state that does not display greatly increased average flexibility at tryptophan residues. Pepsin digestibility of rhodanese follows the pH dependence of conformational changes reported by activity and physical methods. Rhodanese is resistant to proteolysis above pH 4 but becomes increasingly susceptible as the pH is lowered. The form of the enzyme at pH 3 is cleaved at discrete sites to produce a few large fragments. It appears that pepsin initially cleaves close to one end of the protein and then clips at additional sites to produce species of a size expected for the individual domains into which rhodanese is folded. Overall, it appears that in the pH range between pH 3 and 4, titration of groups on rhodanese leads to opening of the structure to produce a conformation resembling, but more rigid than, the molten globule state that is observed as an intermediate during reversible unfolding of rhodanese."
https://openalex.org/W1502698872,"The relationship between the modification and processing of prolipoprotein and the formation of murein-bound lipoprotein has been investigated using Escherichia coli mutants altered in the signal sequence of prolipoprotein and an E. coli strain producing OmpF-Lpp hybrid protein. The glyceride-modified prolipoprotein in mutant lppT20 and in globomycin-treated wild-type strain were covalently attached to the peptidoglycan. Likewise, the unmodified prolipoproteins in mutants lppL20, lppV20, and lppG21 were attached to the peptidoglycan. The OmpF-Lpp hybrid protein that is processed but not modified with lipid due to the absence of the cysteine-containing modification site in the hybrid protein was also covalently linked to the peptidoglycan. These results indicate that neither lipid modification nor the processing of prolipoprotein is essential for the formation of murein-bound lipoprotein in E. coli. In contrast, introduction of a charged amino acid residue such as Asp or Arg at the 14th position of prolipoprotein affected not only the lipid modification and processing of the mutant prolipoprotein but also the formation of murein-bound lipoprotein. Replacement of the Gly14 with Glu or Lys partially affected the lipid modification and processing of prolipoprotein; the peptidoglycan of the lppE14 and lppK14 mutants contained a reduced amount of mature lipoprotein but no mutant prolipoprotein. In addition, lpp mutants A20I23I24 and A20I23K24 were found to be defective in both lipid modification/processing of prolipoprotein and the formation of murein-bound lipoprotein. The defective formation of murein-bound lipoprotein in the latter mutants may be related to an alteration in the secondary structure at the modification/processing site of the mutant prolipoproteins."
