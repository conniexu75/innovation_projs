https://openalex.org/W2078489918,"The identity of cells that establish the hematopoietic microenvironment (HME) in human bone marrow (BM), and of clonogenic skeletal progenitors found in BM stroma, has long remained elusive. We show that MCAM/CD146-expressing, subendothelial cells in human BM stroma are capable of transferring, upon transplantation, the HME to heterotopic sites, coincident with the establishment of identical subendothelial cells within a miniature bone organ. Establishment of subendothelial stromal cells in developing heterotopic BM in vivo occurs via specific, dynamic interactions with developing sinusoids. Subendothelial stromal cells residing on the sinusoidal wall are major producers of Angiopoietin-1 (a pivotal molecule of the HSC ""niche"" involved in vascular remodeling). Our data reveal the functional relationships between establishment of the HME in vivo, establishment of skeletal progenitors in BM sinusoids, and angiogenesis."

The molecular mechanisms underlying such resilience are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that an inbred population of mice subjected to social defeat can be separated into susceptible and unsusceptible subpopulations that differ along several behavioral and physiological domains. By a combination of molecular and electrophysiological techniques, we identify signature adaptations within the mesolimbic dopamine circuit that are uniquely associated with vulnerability or insusceptibility. We show that molecular recapitulations of three prototypical adaptations associated with the unsusceptible phenotype are each sufficient to promote resistant behavior. Our results validate a multidisciplinary approach to examine the neurobiological mechanisms of variations in stress resistance, and illustrate the importance of plasticity within the brain's reward circuits in actively maintaining an emotional homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2057639603,"Molecular chaperones, especially members of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) family, are thought to promote tumor cell survival, but this function is not well understood. Here, we show that mitochondria of tumor cells, but not most normal tissues, contain Hsp90 and its related molecule, TRAP-1. These chaperones interact with Cyclophilin D, an immunophilin that induces mitochondrial cell death, and antagonize its function via protein folding/refolding mechanisms. Disabling this pathway using novel Hsp90 ATPase antagonists directed to mitochondria causes sudden collapse of mitochondrial function and selective tumor cell death. Therefore, Hsp90-directed chaperones are regulators of mitochondrial integrity, and their organelle-specific antagonists may provide a previously undescribed class of potent anticancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W1982384929,"The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) is a key regulator of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. CPC functions are connected to its localization. The complex first localizes to centromeres and later associates with the central spindle and midbody. Survivin, Borealin, and INCENP are the three components of the CPC that regulate the activity and localization of its enzymatic component, the kinase Aurora B. We determined the 1.4 Å resolution crystal structure of the regulatory core of the CPC, revealing that Borealin and INCENP associate with the helical domain of Survivin to form a tight three-helical bundle. We used siRNA rescue experiments with structure-based mutants to explore the requirements for CPC localization. We show that the intertwined structural interactions of the core components lead to functional interdependence. Association of the core “passenger” proteins creates a single structural unit, whose composite molecular surface presents conserved residues essential for central spindle and midbody localization.

Association of the core “passenger” proteins creates a single structural unit, whose composite molecular surface presents conserved residues essential for central spindle and midbody localization. Cell division involves coordinated chromosomal and cytoskeletal rearrangements to ensure the faithful segregation of genetic material into the daughter cells. The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) has emerged as a central player at several steps in this process (reviewed in Vagnarelli and Earnshaw, 2004Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C.

The chromosomal passenger complex: guiding Aurora-B through mitosis.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 833-837Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). At the onset of mitosis, CPC proteins translocate from the arms of the condensing chromosomes to the inner centromeres. At the metaphase to anaphase transition, while the chromosomes move to the poles, CPC proteins dissociate from the centromeres and localize to the microtubules of the central spindle before they eventually associate with the midbody within the intercellular bridge of bundled microtubules that forms at cytokinesis. CPC functions parallel its localization. The complex is involved in chromosome condensation, spindle assembly, correcting microtubule-kinetochore interactions that are inappropriate for chromosome alignment, signaling to the spindle checkpoint, and the completion of cytokinesis (reviewed in Vagnarelli and Earnshaw, 2004Vagnarelli P.

Chromosome bi-orientation on the mitotic spindle.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 581-589Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The CPC is a complex of one enzymatic subunit, the Aurora B kinase (Ipl1 in S. cerevisiae and AIR-2 in C. elegans), and three regulatory subunits, the inner centromere protein INCENP (Sli15 in S. cerevisiae and ICP-1 in C. elegans), Survivin (Bir1 in S. cerevisiae and BIR-1 in C. elegans), and Borealin (Dasra-B in Xenopus and CSC-1 in C. elegans). Aurora B belongs to a conserved family of Ser-Thr protein kinases comprising also Aurora A and C that are crucial regulators of mitosis in eukaryotes (Giet et al., 2005Giet R. Petretti C. Prigent C.

The ever increasing list of Aurora B substrates includes the mitotic histone variant CENP-A (Zeitlin et al., 2001Zeitlin S.G. Shelby R.D. Sullivan K.F.

The current view is that, in general, the targeting of Aurora B to the right substrates at the right place and time is crucial for cell division (reviewed in Vader et al., 2006Vader G. Medema R.H. Lens S.M. The chromosomal passenger complex: guiding Aurora-B through mitosis.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 833-837Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This regulation is achieved by the assembly of the kinase with the other passenger components INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin. INCENP comprises two functional modules. The conserved C-terminal region (known as the IN-box) binds and activates Aurora B (Bishop and Schumacher, 2002Bishop J.D. Schumacher J.M.

Survivin was originally described as an antiapoptotic protein that is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers (Ambrosini et al., 1997Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C.

Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Although it contains a domain characteristic of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, the baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain, the involvement of Survivin in apoptotic regulation is controversial (Lens et al., 2006aLens S.M. Vader G. Medema R.H. The case for Survivin as mitotic regulator.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Indeed, interference with Survivin in both human cells and C. elegans causes mitotic phenotypes similar to those observed upon inhibition of Aurora B but not rapid cell death (Carvalho et al., 2003Carvalho A.

Structural studies have shown the involvement of the BIR domain in mediating Survivin homodimerization (Verdecia et al., 2000Verdecia M.A. Huang H. Dutil E. Kaiser D.A. Hunter T. Noel J.P.

Cell. 2007; 12: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Borealin (also known as Dasra) is the most recently identified component of the CPC (Gassmann et al., 2004Gassmann R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J. Ruchaud S. Hudson D.F. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Gerloff D.L.

No ortholog has been identified to date in yeast, and the C. elegans counterpart (CSC-1) is only distantly related (Romano et al., 2003Romano A. Guse A. Krascenicova I. Schnabel H. Schnabel R. Glotzer M. CSC-1: a subunit of the Aurora B kinase complex that binds to the survivin-like protein BIR-1 and the incenp-like protein ICP-1.J.

Borealin: a novel chromosomal passenger required for stability of the bipolar mitotic spindle.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 179-191Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Borealin binds directly to Survivin and INCENP but not Aurora B and shows DNA-binding properties in vitro (Klein et al., 2006Klein U.R. Nigg E.A. Gruneberg U. Centromere targeting of the chromosomal passenger complex requires a ternary subcomplex of Borealin, Survivin, and the N-terminal domain of INCENP.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2547-2558Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Its C-terminal region has been implicated in targeting the CPC to centromeres (Gassmann et al., 2004Gassmann R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J. Ruchaud S. Hudson D.F. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. Borealin: a novel chromosomal passenger required for stability of the bipolar mitotic spindle.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 179-191Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The emerging picture of the CPC is that of a sophisticated machine engaged in a complex network of interactions. Studies to date have concentrated on the precise contribution of each subunit in localizing the complex. However, dissection of individual functions has been hampered by the interdependence of the different subunits. The outstanding questions we have addressed in this work are why the passenger proteins are interdependent and whether subcomplexes might exist and fulfill different functions. The N-terminal 141 residues of Borealin have been shown to interact with Survivin as efficiently as the full-length protein and to be sufficient for the localization of both Borealin and Survivin to the central spindle and midbody (Gassmann et al., 2004Gassmann R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J. Ruchaud S. Hudson D.F. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. Borealin: a novel chromosomal passenger required for stability of the bipolar mitotic spindle.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 179-191Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Aiming at structural studies, we first assessed the minimal interacting regions of Borealin and Survivin by reconstituting the complex in vitro and subjecting it to limited proteolysis. Full-length (f.l.) human Survivin (residues 1–142) and f.l. human Borealin (1–280) were expressed in E. coli and copurified. Upon trypsin treatment, Survivin remained intact while Borealin was digested to a stable fragment encompassing residues 10–109 (mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing; results not shown). Since this Borealin fragment is smaller than the one previously characterized to interact with Survivin and localize to the central spindle and midbody (residues 1–141) (Gassmann et al., 2004Gassmann R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J. Ruchaud S. Hudson D.F. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. Borealin: a novel chromosomal passenger required for stability of the bipolar mitotic spindle.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 179-191Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar), we proceeded to analyze Borealin10–109. To assess the function of Borealin10–109 in localizing the CPC, we used an siRNA-based complementation approach previously described for INCENP (Klein et al., 2006Klein U.R. Nigg E.A. Gruneberg U. Centromere targeting of the chromosomal passenger complex requires a ternary subcomplex of Borealin, Survivin, and the N-terminal domain of INCENP.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2547-2558Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Endogenous Borealin was depleted from HeLa cells using siRNA duplexes targeting the 3′UTR region of the transcript. The knock down of Borealin resulted in the displacement of all other CPC members from the centromere at prometaphase, as well as the central spindle and midbody during anaphase and cytokinesis, respectively (Figure 1A). In these cells chromosome alignment as well as chromosome segregation was severely perturbed as judged by incomplete metaphase plate formation and lagging chromosomes in anaphase cells and cells that commence cytokinesis. In contrast, in cells simultaneously transfected with Myc-tagged f.l. Borealin, the recruitment of the CPC to its distinct localizations was rescued and chromosome alignment and chromosome segregation occurred properly (Figure 1B). In the same assay, Myc-tagged Borealin10–109 was unable to restore localization of the CPC to the centromere, but it targeted the CPC to the central spindle and midbody (Figure 1C). A shorter N-terminal fragment of Borealin (Borealin10–57) did not rescue the localization of the CPC during progression through mitosis (Figure 1D). We next tested if Borealin10–109 could rescue the cytokinesis defect observed upon CPC depletion. While Borealin depletion resulted in 33.6% of multinucleated cells, rescue with f.l. Borealin led to a decrease to 12.8%. (Figure 1E). Interestingly, cell division was largely restored in cells rescued with Borealin10–109 but not Borealin10–57 (12.9% multinucleation and 32.4% multinucleation, respectively). Cells expressing these fragments showed chromosome segregation defects (data not shown), as would be expected from the loss of centromere-related functions of Aurora B. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments using the Myc-tagged Borealin constructs, Borealin10–109 efficiently pulled down INCENP, Aurora B, and Survivin, while Borealin10–57 did not coimmunoprecipitate any of the other CPC subunits (Figure 1F). Thus, Borealin10–109 is functional in vivo to form a minimal CPC core complex that localizes to the central spindle and midbody and properly executes the role of the CPC during cytokinesis. We next investigated the formation of subcomplexes between INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin10–109. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that Borealin10–109 binds to Survivin (Figure 2A, upper row) but not to Aurora B (Figure 2A, bottom row) and that its binding to INCENP is mediated via the first 58 amino acids of INCENP (Figure 2A, middle two rows). A complex of Borealin10–109 and Survivin as well as a complex of Borealin10–109, Survivin, and INCENP1–58 could be reconstituted with recombinant proteins in vitro (Figure 2B). The Survivin–Borealin10–109 complex migrated in size-exclusion chromatography at a smaller volume than would be expected from the calculated mass (27.8 kDa) (Figure 2C). Since gel filtration is sensitive to the shape of the molecule and since Survivin is known to form a homodimer with an elongated shape (Verdecia et al., 2000Verdecia M.A. Huang H. Dutil E. Kaiser D.A. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Structure of the human anti-apoptotic protein survivin reveals a dimeric arrangement.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, Chantalat et al., 2000Chantalat L. Skoufias D.A. Kleman J.P. Jung B. Dideberg O. Margolis R.L. Crystal structure of human survivin reveals a bow tie-shaped dimer with two unusual α-helical extensions.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 183-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we tested the oligomeric state of the Survivin–Borealin10–109 complex by analytical ultracentrifugation. In a sedimentation velocity experiment carried out with 32 μM Survivin–Borealin10–109, the complex sedimented as a single peak with a molecular mass of 53 kDa (Figure 2D) in good agreement with the calculated molecular weight of a homodimeric Survivin–Borealin10–109 assembly. Remarkably, the reconstituted ternary complex comprising Borealin10–109, Survivin, and INCENP1–58 eluted in size-exclusion chromatography at an apparently lower molecular mass than the Survivin–Borealin10–109 binary complex (Figure 2C). By analytical ultracentrifugation, Survivin–Borealin10–109–INCENP1–58 sedimented at a molecular mass of 35 kDa (Figure 2D), consistent with a complex of 1:1:1 stoichiometry (calculated molecular weight 34.7 kDa). Reconstitution of the ternary complex with f.l. Borealin and subsequent proteolysis resulted in an identical Borealin fragment as obtained from the binary complex (data not shown). We conclude that Borealin10–109, Survivin, and INCENP1–58 interact directly in vitro to form a minimal CPC core complex of monomeric nature. The Survivin–Borealin10–109–INCENP1–58 complex was crystallized and its structure determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD). The structure was refined to 1.4 Å resolution, with an R factor of 18.5%, Rfree of 20.2%, and good stereochemistry (Table S1). The final model includes residues 5–141 of Survivin, 15–76 of Borealin, and 3–46 of INCENP, for which we observe well-defined electron density (Figure S1). The other residues present in the crystallized constructs are presumably disordered. The overall tertiary structure of Survivin in the complex is very similar to that reported previously in the absence of other CPC components (Verdecia et al., 2000Verdecia M.A. Huang H. Dutil E.

Solution structure of human survivin and its binding interface with Smac/Diablo.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, Survivin is characterized by an N-terminal globular domain (the BIR domain) and a long C-terminal helix spanning 11 helical turns (C helix) (Figure 3A, upper panels). The BIR domain (residues 15–89) consists of a three-stranded antiparallel β sheet surrounded by four helices. It includes a Zinc ion that has a structural role and is coordinated by the conserved residues Cys57Sur, Cys60Sur, His77Sur, and Cys84Sur (throughout the text the “Sur'” superscript refers to residues of Survivin, while the “Bor” and “INC” superscripts refer to residues of Borealin and INCENP, respectively). A short linker (residues 90–99) connects the BIR domain to the C helix (residues 100–142). The C helix contacts the BIR domain with its first five helical turns and then extends away for about 25 Å. The extent of intramolecular interactions suggests that Survivin forms a single structural unit, consistent with its stability upon protease treatment and with the unfolding detected by NMR upon separating the C helix from the BIR domain (Sun et al., 2005Sun C. Nettesheim D. Liu Z. Olejniczak E.T. Solution structure of human survivin and its binding interface with Smac/Diablo.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Borealin and INCENP bind Survivin to form a three-helix bundle (Figure 3A). INCENP forms a single α helix that is 10 turns long (residues 8–46) and stacks parallel to the Survivin C helix. Borealin is also characterized by a long α helix (αB1, residues 15–60), which stacks with 12 turns against the Survivin C helix in an antiparallel fashion. In addition, Borealin contains two small α helices (αB2, residues 63–67 and αB3, residues 70–75,) arranged almost perpendicular to the bundle. This part of the molecule caps the first turn of the Survivin C helix and wraps around the linker (Figure 3A, upper panels). A structure-based sequence alignment of the regions of the three components involved in the formation of the CPC core structure in human, Xenopus laevis, and Danio rerio (Figures 3B and S2) shows 35%, 30%, and 30% sequence identity for Survivin, Borealin, and INCENP, respectively. The majority of conserved residues either form the core of the three-helix bundle or the core of the BIR domain of Survivin. The core of the helical bundle is formed by an intertwined set of hydrophobic interactions with residues contributed by all three proteins (Figure 3A, close-up view, left panel). In addition, electrostatic contacts link Survivin with Borealin (Lys110Sur–Asp51Bor, Lys121Sur–Glu40Bor, and Arg132Sur–Asp29Bor), Survivin with INCENP (Lys112Sur–Asp16INC and Lys120Sur–Asp27INC), and Borealin with INCENP (Arg35Bor–Asp30INC and Glu49Bor–Lys18INC) (Figure 3A, close-up view, right panel). The structural comparison of CPC-bound Survivin and apo-Survivin at the tertiary structural level reveals a significant difference in the conformation of the C helix, the C-terminal half of which swings away by 12° in the CPC-bound state (Figure S3). However, the most striking difference between the apo state and the CPC-bound state is in its quaternary structure. Survivin exists as a homodimer in the apo state (Figure 4A, upper panel) and as a monomer in the CPC-bound state (Figure 4B, upper panel). In the apo state, dimerization of human Survivin is mediated by the first turn of the C helix, the linker region, and the N-terminal residues of the BIR domain (Verdecia et al., 2000Verdecia M.A. Huang H.

Specifically, Leu98Sur from one molecule protrudes into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Leu6Sur, Trp10Sur, Phe93Sur, Phe101Sur, and Leu102Sur of the other molecule (Figure 4A, lower panel). In the CPC, this hydrophobic pocket of Survivin recognizes apolar residues of Borealin (Leu61Bor, Leu65Bor, Trp70Bor, Leu71Bor, Tyr73Bor, and Phe74Bor) and is closed at the back by INCENP (Pro8INC and Ile9INC) (Figure 4B, lower panel). The interaction between Survivin and Borealin in the CPC exhibits striking molecular mimicry of the apo-Survivin–Survivin interaction. The hydrogen-bonding network engaging the backbone of Borealin Arg66Bor, Met68Bor, and Trp70Bor parallels that of Survivin Leu96Sur, Leu98Sur, and Gly99Sur in the apo structure (Figure S4). Formation of the complex involves an induced-fit rearrangement of the hydrophobic residues of Survivin, which undergo small but relevant changes in the positioning of their side chains to recognize Borealin and INCENP (Figure S3). The finding of a stable Survivin–Borealin subcomplex of the CPC in vitro (Figure 2) and data on the existence of an INCENP–Aurora B subcomplex (Gassmann et al., 2004Gassmann R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J. Ruchaud S. Hudson D.F. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. Borealin: a novel chromosomal passenger required for stability of the bipolar mitotic spindle.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 179-191Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the effect of disrupting specific subsets of protein-protein interactions. First, we analyzed the structure to identify residues of Borealin whose mutation would specifically disrupt its binding to either Survivin or INCENP. In the globular part of the CPC core structure, Borealin residues Trp70Bor and Phe74Bor dock into the hydrophobic pocket present on the BIR domain of Survivin (Leu6Sur, Trp10Sur, Phe13Sur, Phe101Sur) and have only marginal contacts with INCENP (Figures 5A and 5B). On the other hand, in the helical bundle of the CPC, Borealin Arg35Bor interacts electrostatically with INCENP Asp30INC, and Leu46Bor interacts hydrophobically with Phe22INC and Leu19INC (Figures 5A and 5C). However, neither Arg35Bor nor Leu46Bor contact Survivin. Therefore, in order to create a complex in which Borealin binds INCENP (and thus Aurora B) but not Survivin, we mutated residues Trp70Bor and Phe74Bor to negatively charged amino acids (W70E, F74E). By mutating Arg35Bor with a reverse-charge substitution and Leu46Bor with a bulky side-chain substitution (R35E, L46Y) we attempted to generate a second complex in which Borealin binds Survivin but not INCENP. In line with the structural data, the f.l. Borealin W70E, F74E mutant was able to coimmunoprecipitate INCENP and Aurora B but not Survivin, while the Borealin R35E, L46Y mutant coimmunoprecipitated Survivin but not INCENP or Aurora B (Figure 5D). Being able to constitute different subcomplexes of the CPC in vivo we utilized the siRNA rescue assay mentioned above to evaluate their functionality (see controls in Figure 1A). Borealin W70E, F74"

We have discovered stem cells in the adult carotid body (CB), an oxygen-sensing organ of the sympathoadrenal lineage that grows in chronic hypoxemia. Production of new neuron-like CB glomus cells depends on a population of stem cells, which form multipotent and self-renewing colonies in vitro. Cell fate mapping experiments indicate that, unexpectedly, CB stem cells are the glia-like sustentacular cells and can be identified using glial markers. Remarkably, stem cell-derived glomus cells have the same complex chemosensory properties as mature in situ glomus cells. They are highly dopaminergic and produce glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Thus, the mammalian CB is a neurogenic center with a recognizable physiological function in adult life. CB stem cells could be potentially useful for antiparkinsonian cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2159406166,"SUMO conjugation to proteins is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular functions. We have identified a protein, RWD-containing sumoylation enhancer (RSUME), that enhances overall SUMO-1, -2, and -3 conjugation by interacting with the SUMO conjugase Ubc9. RSUME increases noncovalent binding of SUMO-1 to Ubc9 and enhances Ubc9 thioester formation and SUMO polymerization. RSUME enhances the sumoylation of IkB in vitro and in cultured cells, leading to an inhibition of NF-kB transcriptional activity. RSUME is induced by hypoxia and enhances the sumoylation of HIF-1α, promoting its stabilization and transcriptional activity during hypoxia. Disruption of the RWD domain structure of RSUME demonstrates that this domain is critical for RSUME action. Together, these findings point to a central role of RSUME in the regulation of sumoylation and, hence, several critical regulatory pathways in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2140428678,"Despite the wealth of different actin structures formed, only two actin nucleation factors are well established in vertebrates: the Arp2/3 complex and formins. Here, we describe a further nucleator, cordon-bleu (Cobl). Cobl is a brain-enriched protein using three Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein homology 2 (WH2) domains for actin binding. Cobl promotes nonbundled, unbranched filaments. Filament formation relies on barbed-end growth and requires all three Cobl WH2 domains and the extended linker L2. We suggest that the nucleation power of Cobl is based on the assembly of three actin monomers in cross-filament orientation. Cobl localizes to sites of high actin dynamics and modulates cell morphology. In neurons, induction of both neurites and neurite branching is dramatically increased by Cobl expression-effects that critically depend on Cobl's actin nucleation ability. Correspondingly, Cobl depletion results in decreased dendritic arborization. Thus, Cobl is an actin nucleator controlling neuronal morphology and development."
https://openalex.org/W2127114287,"Bone mass and turnover are maintained by the coordinated balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts, under regulation of many systemic and local factors. Phosphoinositide-dependent serine-threonine protein kinase Akt is one of the key players in the signaling of potent bone anabolic factors. This study initially showed that the disruption of Akt1, a major Akt in osteoblasts and osteoclasts, in mice led to low-turnover osteopenia through dysfunctions of both cells. Ex vivo cell culture analyses revealed that the osteoblast dysfunction was traced to the increased susceptibility to the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and the decreased transcriptional activity of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Notably, our findings revealed a novel role of Akt1/forkhead box class O (FoxO) 3a/Bim axis in the apoptosis of osteoblasts: Akt1 phosphorylates the transcription factor FoxO3a to prevent its nuclear localization, leading to impaired transactivation of its target gene Bim which was also shown to be a potent proapoptotic molecule in osteoblasts. The osteoclast dysfunction was attributed to the cell autonomous defects of differentiation and survival in osteoclasts and the decreased expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), a major determinant of osteoclastogenesis, in osteoblasts. Akt1 was established as a crucial regulator of osteoblasts and osteoclasts by promoting their differentiation and survival to maintain bone mass and turnover. The molecular network found in this study will provide a basis for rational therapeutic targets for bone disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2161489869,"Background The histone variant histone H2A.X comprises up to 25% of the H2A complement in mammalian cells. It is rapidly phosphorylated following exposure of cells to double-strand break (DSB) inducing agents such as ionising radiation. Within minutes of DSB generation, H2AX molecules are phosphorylated in large chromatin domains flanking DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs); these domains can be observed by immunofluorescence microscopy and are termed γH2AX foci. H2AX phosphorylation is believed to have a role mounting an efficient cellular response to DNA damage. Theoretical considerations suggest an essentially random chromosomal distribution of X-ray induced DSBs, and experimental evidence does not consistently indicate otherwise. However, we observed an apparently uneven distribution of γH2AX foci following X-irradiation with regions of the nucleus devoid of foci. Methodology/Principle Findings Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that focal phosphorylation of histone H2AX occurs preferentially in euchromatic regions of the genome following X-irradiation. H2AX phosphorylation has also been demonstrated previously to occur at stalled replication forks induced by UV radiation or exposure to agents such as hydroxyurea. In this study, treatment of S-phase cells with hydroxyurea lead to efficient H2AX phosphorylation in both euchromatin and heterochromatin at times when these chromatin compartments were undergoing replication. This suggests a block to H2AX phosphorylation in heterochromatin that is at least partially relieved by ongoing DNA replication. Conclusions/Significance We discus a number of possible mechanisms that could account for the observed pattern of H2AX phosphorylation. Since γH2AX is regarded as forming a platform for the recruitment or retention of other DNA repair and signaling molecules, these findings imply that the processing of DSBs in heterochromatin differs from that in euchromatic regions. The differential responses of heterochromatic and euchromatic compartments of the genome to DSBs will have implications for understanding the processes of DNA repair in relation to nuclear and chromatin organization."
https://openalex.org/W1976367392,"After translational termination, mRNA and P site deacylated tRNA remain associated with ribosomes in posttermination complexes (post-TCs), which must therefore be recycled by releasing mRNA and deacylated tRNA and by dissociating ribosomes into subunits. Recycling of bacterial post-TCs requires elongation factor EF-G and a ribosome recycling factor RRF. Eukaryotes do not encode a RRF homolog, and their mechanism of ribosomal recycling is unknown. We investigated eukaryotic recycling using post-TCs assembled on a model mRNA encoding a tetrapeptide followed by a UAA stop codon and report that initiation factors eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF3j, a loosely associated subunit of eIF3, can promote recycling of eukaryotic post-TCs. eIF3 is the principal factor that promotes splitting of posttermination ribosomes into 60S subunits and tRNA- and mRNA-bound 40S subunits. Its activity is enhanced by eIFs 3j, 1, and 1A. eIF1 also mediates release of P site tRNA, whereas eIF3j ensures subsequent dissociation of mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2021509563,"Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a member of the ATF/cyclic AMP response element-binding family of transcription factors. We present evidence that ATF3 has a dichotomous role in cancer development. By both gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we found that ATF3 enhances apoptosis in the untransformed MCF10A mammary epithelial cells, but protects the aggressive MCF10CA1a cells and enhances its cell motility. Array analyses indicated that ATF3 upregulates the expression of several genes in the tumor necrosis factor pathway in the MCF10A cells but upregulates the expression of several genes implicated in tumor metastasis, including TWIST1, fibronectin (FN)-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, caveolin-1 and Slug, in the MCF10CA1a cells. We present evidence that ATF3 binds to the endogenous promoters and regulates the transcription of the TWIST1, FN-1, Snail and Slug genes. Furthermore, conditioned medium experiments indicated that ATF3 has a paracrine/autocrine effect, consistent with its upregulation of genes encoding secreted factors. Finally, ATF3 gene copy number is >2 in ∼80% of the breast tumors examined (N=48) and its protein level is elevated in ∼50% of the tumors. These results provided a correlative argument that it is advantageous for the malignant cancer cells to express ATF3, consistent with its oncogenic roles suggested by the MCF10CA1a cell data."
https://openalex.org/W2076392163,"During neurogenesis, the progression from a progenitor cell to a differentiated neuron is believed to be unidirectional and irreversible. The Rb family of proteins (Rb, p107, and p130) regulates cell-cycle exit and differentiation during retinogenesis. Rb and p130 are redundantly expressed in the neurons of the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the retina. We have found that in the adult Rb;p130-deficient retinae p107 compensation prevents ectopic proliferation of INL neurons. However, p107 is haploinsufficient in this process. Differentiated Rb−/−;p107+/−;p130−/− horizontal interneurons re-entered the cell cycle, clonally expanded, and formed metastatic retinoblastoma. Horizontal cells were not affected in Rb+/−;p107−/−;p130−/− or Rb−/−;p107−/−;p130+/−, retinae suggesting that one copy of Rb or p130 was sufficient to prevent horizontal proliferation.

With a combination of loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, we showed that Snail repressed the expression of RKIP in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. The effect of Snail on RKIP was on the level of transcriptional initiation and mediated by a proximal E-box on the RKIP promoter. Our results therefore suggest that RKIP is a novel component of the Snail transcriptional regulatory network important for the progression and metastasis of cancer."

Although the results were comparable with those from array CGH, regions of those genetic changes were defined more accurately by SNP arrays. Integrating the Ensembl public data, we have generated ‘gene’ copy number indices that facilitate the search for novel candidates involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Copy numbers in a subset of the genes were validated using quantitative real-time PCR. The SKAP2/SCAP2 gene (7p15.2), which belongs to the src family kinases, was most frequently (63%) amplified in our sample set and its recurrent overexpression (67%) was confirmed by reverse transcription–PCR. Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization and in situ RNA hybridization analyses for this gene have demonstrated a significant correlation between DNA copy number and mRNA expression level in an independent sample set (P<0.001). These findings indicate that the dysregulation of SKAP2/SCAP2, which is mostly caused by its increased gene copy number, is likely to be associated with the development of PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W1983387895,"Assembly of SNARE proteins between opposing membranes mediates fusion of synthetic liposomes, but it is unknown whether SNAREs act during exocytosis at the moment of Ca2+ increase, providing the molecular force for fusion of secretory vesicles. Here, we show that execution of pre- and postfusional steps during chromaffin granule exocytosis depends crucially on a short molecular distance between the complex-forming SNARE motif and the transmembrane anchor of the vesicular SNARE protein synaptobrevin II. Extending the juxtamembrane region of synaptobrevin by insertion of flexible “linkers” reduces priming of granules, delays initiation of exocytosis upon stepwise elevation of intracellular calcium, attenuates fluctuations of early fusion pores, and slows rapid expansion of the pore in a linker-length dependent fashion. These observations provide evidence that v-SNARE proteins drive Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion at millisecond time scale and support a model wherein continuous molecular pulling by SNAREs guides the vesicle throughout the consecutive stages of exocytosis."

In such a preparation there is a considerable lag phase during the continuous assay of the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase reaction. Addition of a small (5–10 μm) pulse of NADH before the assay results in activation of the enzyme after several slow turnovers when NADH is oxidized by the quinone. This eliminates the lag phase, and the enzyme becomes fully active and catalyzes oxidation of NADH at a linear rate (18Kotlyar A.B. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Therefore, the final zero-order steady state reaction rates for both forms of the enzyme are the same and depend only on the amount of the enzyme added. In the presence of divalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+), or at alkaline pH, the activation takes longer, and the lag phase is more pronounced. Divalent cations have no effect on the activity of the A-form. The high activation energy (270 kJ/mol) of the deactivation process (22Maklashina E.O. Sled' V.D. Vinogradov A.D. Biokhimiia. 1994; 59: 946-957PubMed Google Scholar) indicates the occurrence of major conformational changes in the organization of the enzyme. However, until now, the only conformational difference observed between these two forms is the number of cysteine residues exposed at the surface of the enzyme (23Gavrikova E.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Gostimskaya I.S. Cecchini G. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Treatment of the D-form of complex I with the sulfhydryl reagents NEM or DTNB irreversibly blocks critical cysteine residue(s), abolishing the ability of the enzyme to respond to activation, thus inactivating it irreversibly. The A-form of complex I is insensitive to sulfhydryl reagents. It has been shown that modification of a cysteine residue(s) of a single subunit with an apparent mass of 15 kDa is responsible for the irreversible inactivation of the D-form by NEM (23Gavrikova E.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the A-form of complex I this subunit is not accessible to any covalent modification, accounting for the insensitivity of this form to NEM. Despite advanced biochemical analysis of the kinetic behavior of both forms of complex I (20Vinogradov A.D. Grivennikova V.G. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the functional role of the observed heterogeneity has not yet been explained. We have now investigated the effect of nitrosothiols and ONOO– on the A- and D-forms of the enzyme. We have found that only the conformationally modified D-form of complex I is a target for nitrosothiols and ONOO–, whereas the active form is insensitive to these compounds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there are NO-dependent biochemical mechanisms that can influence the equilibrium between the A- and D-forms. It is possible that A/D transitions of complex I take place in certain pathophysiological situations, making this enzyme an early mitochondrial target for nitrosative stress. Bovine heart SMP were prepared according to standard procedure (18Kotlyar A.B. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and stored in liquid nitrogen. As predicted from earlier studies (25Vinogradov A.D. Gavrikova E.V. Grivennikova V.G. Zharova T.V. Zakharova N.V. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1999; 64: 136-152PubMed Google Scholar), around 40% of complex I in our preparation was present in the D-form because of the temperature conditions during purification. To prepare SMP in which complex I is present almost entirely in the D-form, an aliquot of frozen membranes was thawed, diluted to 5 mg/ml with standard medium (including 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTPA, 10 μm neocuprine supplemented with 1 mm malonate for activation of succinate dehydrogenase (26Kotlyar A.B. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 784: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and 5 mm MgCl2), and incubated at 35 °C for 1 h. This treatment resulted in almost complete deactivation of complex I. The resulting SMP were diluted twice with the same buffer at pH 8.8 and incubated aerobically for 20 min at room temperature with 1% ethanol and 400 μm NAD+ while being constantly stirred. To obtain SMP in which complex I is present in the A-form, alcohol dehydrogenase (100 μg/ml from Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Sigma) was added to the above mixture. During a 20-min incubation with alcohol dehydrogenase, the substoichiometric amounts of NADH produced by the regeneration system were oxidized by complex I; this treatment resulted in full activation and maintained the enzyme in the A-form when kept at 25 °C. Such treatment was found to be more efficient at preserving complex I in its A-form at physiological temperatures than the previously described incubation of SMP with slowly oxidized NADPH (23Gavrikova E.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Oxidation of NADH was determined spectrophotometrically (using a Varian Cary 4000) as a decrease in absorption at 340 nm with 200 μm NADH in the standard assay medium (pH 7.0) containing SMP (10–25 μg of protein/ml). As additional measurements of complex I activity, NADH:Q1 or NADH:HAR oxidoreductase reductase were assayed in the presence of 1 mm cyanide with the addition of 100 μm Q1 or 2 mm HAR, respectively. If the measurement of full NADH:oxidase activity of the D-form of complex I was required, the enzyme was “activated” bya10 μm pulse of NADH added directly to the spectrophotometric cuvette, and then full NADH oxidase or NADH:Q1 reductase was assayed. Solutions of GSNO, SNAP, DETA-NO, and SIN-1 were prepared freshly before the experiments. Peroxynitrite was synthesized according to a previously published protocol (27Hughes M.N. Nicklin H.G. J. Chem. Soc. 1968; 2: 450-452Crossref Google Scholar). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except SIN-1, which was from Invitrogen. Protein content was determined with a Biuret assay. Data are presented as means ± S.E. (n >3). The experimental details are described in the legends to figures. NADH Regeneration System; Sensitivity of A- and D-forms to NEM—Because of the fast thermally dependent spontaneous transition of the enzyme to the D-form, the maintenance of the enzyme in its active state at temperatures of >20 °C requires special conditions. An alcohol dehydrogenase/ethanol regeneration system for NADH (28Hayes J.E. Velik S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 207: 225-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was therefore developed and successfully implemented to keep the enzyme in the A-form. The below-Km concentrations of NADH generated by the metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase were continuously oxidized by complex I of the SMP, maintaining the enzyme at a constant turnover even at temperatures above 25 °C. Fig. 1 demonstrates the dramatic difference in sensitivity to NEM of the A- and the D-form of the enzyme. Addition of NEM had only a slight inhibitory effect on the NADH oxidase activity of the A-form, whereas it rapidly inhibited the enzyme activity of the D-form. Thus, upon deactivation, complex I appeared to become sensitive to cysteine modification. Effect of Low Molecular Weight Nitrosothiols on Complex I—Fig. 2 demonstrates a dramatic difference in sensitivity of the A- and the D-form of complex I toward S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) or S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). Only the D-form was inhibited by GSNO or SNAP, whereas the A-form was insensitive to these nitrosating agents. The inhibitory effect of GSNO on NADH oxidase activity was similar when NADH:Q1 reductase activity was measured, indicating a direct effect on complex I and not on downstream components of the respiratory chain (Table 1). Furthermore, the oxidation of NADH by the artificial acceptor HAR was not affected by treatment with GSNO, showing that the content of complex I in the SMP was unchanged.TABLE 1Action of different effectors on the D-form of complex IComplex I activityNADH-oxidaseNADH:Q1 reductaseNADH:HAR reductaseμmol NADH × min-1 × mg-1Control1.10 ± 0.050.80 ± 0.076.8 ± 0.11 mm GSNO0.15 ± 0.090.12 ± 0.096.7 ± 0.11 mm GSNO + 1 mm CPTIO0.12 ± 0.050.11 ± 0.086.8 ± 0.02 mmDETA-NO1.21 ± 0.020.83 ± 0.056.8 ± 0.11 mmGSH1.11 ± 0.100.82 ± 0.106.8 ± 0.01 mmDETA-NO + 0.2 mm GSH0.95 ± 0.090.79 ± 0.096.8 ± 0.01 mmGSSG0.96 ± 0.100.75 ± 0.16.8 ± 0.0 Open table in a new tab During decomposition low molecular weight nitrosothiols such as GSNO and SNAP can generate free NO in the solution. Complex 1 can be modified either by transfer of NO+ or via direct nitrosation by the NO generated. To distinguish between these two mechanisms, additional assays were conducted (see Table 1). We found that the addition of 1 mm CPTIO, a potent scavenger of NO (k ∼ 104 m–1 s–1) (29Akaike T. Yoshida M. Miyamoto Y. Sato K. Kohno M. Sasamoto K. Miyazaki K. Ueda S. Maeda H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), did not change the inhibitory action of GSNO on the D-form of the enzyme. CPTIO alone has no effect on the activity of the D-form (not shown). In contrast with GSNO and SNAP, prolonged incubation (>2h) of SMP with 2 mm DETA-NO did not affect the NADH oxidase activity of the D-form of complex I, neither did reduced nor oxidized glutathione (1 mm) (Table 1). Under the same experimental conditions, none of the above treatments had any effect on the A-form of the enzyme (not shown). Because S-nitrosothiols are sensitive to reducing agents, following treatment with GSNO the inhibited D-form of the enzyme was washed to remove excess GSNO, resuspended in the same medium, and treated with reducing agents. Addition of DTT (1 mm) or GSH (1 mm) led to a significant recovery of the NADH-dependent activities (Table 2). Copper ions are known to catalyze the fast decomposition of S-nitrosothiols, and the reversal of the inhibition was found to be greater when SMP were incubated together with copper and GSH (Table 2).TABLE 2Reversal of the inhibition by GSNO of the D-form of complex I in SMPComplex I activityNADH-oxidaseNADH:Q1 reductaseμmol NADH × min-1 × mg-1GSNO alone0.15 ± 0.050.12 ± 0.061 mm GSH0.60 ± 0.090.55 ± 0.161 mm DTT0.65 ± 0.140.73 ± 0.151 mm GSH + 0.2 mm CuCl20.87 ± 0.090.70 ± 0.100.2 mm CuCl20.18 ± 0.120.06 ± 0.10 Open table in a new tab Effect of Peroxynitrite on Complex I—Peroxynitrite is known to nitrate or nitrosate amino acids such as tyrosine (30Beckman J.S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to cause inhibition of complex I in cell (9Clementi E. Brown G.C. Feelisch M. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7631-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) mitochondria (7Radi R. Rodriguez M. Castro L. Telleri R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 12Borutaite V. Budriunaite A. Brown G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and SMP (13Riobo N.A. Clementi E. Melani M. Boveris A. Cadenas E. Moncada S. Poderoso J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The effect of ONOO– on the A- and D-forms of complex I is shown in Fig. 3A. Addition of ONOO– directly to the spectrophotometric cuvette had only a small effect on the NADH oxidase activity of the A-form, whereas that of the D-form was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3A). The succinate oxidase reaction was also affected by ONOO– but to a lesser extent (not shown). Addition of GSH (0.5 mm) to the buffer protected the D-form from inhibition by ONOO–. Fully decomposed ONOO– had no effect on the activity of the enzyme (not shown). Upon decomposition SIN-1 generates both superoxide anion and NO and is commonly used as a donor of ONOO–. Addition of SIN-1 (0.5 mm) had no effect on the A-form but significantly inhibited the activity of the D-form of the enzyme (Fig. 3B). Addition of 200 units/ml bovine liver SOD in the incubation mixture protected the D-form from SIN-1-induced inhibition (Fig. 3B). After washing, SMP treated with ONOO– or SIN-1 were subjected to incubation with the reducing agents shown in Table 2. Complex I inhibition was not reversed by prolonged (2–3 h) treatment with any of the reducing agents described (not shown), thereby indicating that the effect of ONOO– on the D-form of the enzyme was not simply dependent on S-nitrosation. The key cysteine residue determining the sensitivity of the D-form of the enzyme to NEM can be modified by other SH reagents. As reported previously (24Gostimskaya I.S. Cecchini G. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), only the D-form of complex I is inhibited by 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), (DTNB, Ellman's reagent), but unlike NEM, the activity of the DTNB-inhibited enzyme can be restored after treatment with DTT. We investigated whether ONOO– targets the same cysteine residue by treating the D-form with DTNB and then with ONOO–. Subsequent removal of the DTNB by adding DTT did not restore the enzyme activity, indicating that the effect of ONOO– cannot be explained simply by modification of the only critical cysteine involved in A/D transition (Fig. 4). Our present results confirm previous observations on the inhibition of complex I by nitrosating agents (9Clementi E. Brown G.C. Feelisch M. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7631-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 12Borutaite V. Budriunaite A. Brown G.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Physiol. 1991; 260: C910-C916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, they show that the susceptibility of complex I to inhibition is dependent on the exposure of a crucial cysteine residue, which is characteristic of this protein in its de-activated form. The mechanism by which inhibition takes place may be through S-nitrosation, S-glutathionylation, or both (33Giustarini D. Milzani A. Aldini G. Carini M. Rossi R. Dalle-Donne I. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Protein S-nitrosation can result from a transnitrosation reaction, in which a nitrosonium ion is directly transferred from GSNO to another protein cysteine residue. Alternatively, the incubation of GSNO and a cysteine-containing protein can produce a mixed disulfide by a S-glutathionylation mechanism. However it has been shown that the glutathionylating activity of GSNO solutions can be explained by the formation of various decomposition products such as glutathione thiosulfinate or thiosulfonate (33Giustarini D. Milzani A. Aldini G. Carini M. Rossi R. Dalle-Donne I. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 34Tao L. English A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); therefore, it is not likely that freshly prepared GSNO solution is a good glutathionylating agent. Furthermore, S-glutathionylation (or S-thiolation in general) is a much slower process than S-nitrosation. Incubation of GSNO-inhibited complex I with glutathione transferase did not result in recovery of enzymatic activity (not shown). In addition, inhibition of complex 1 by SNAP, which is known to be a pure nitrosating agent (35Konorev E.A. Kalyanaraman B. Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1671-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), progresses at the same rate as that of GSNO. These observations, together with the fact that the inhibition by both agents was reversed by copper ions (Table 2) and that glutathione alone, whether reduced or oxidized, had no effect on either form of complex I, strongly support S-nitrosation as the mechanism of GSNO- and SNAP-induced inhibition. In contrast, neither DETA-NO on its own nor SIN-1 in the presence of SOD was able to inhibit complex I. This, together with the fact that in the dark when chelating agents are present GSNO is fairly stable (i.e. does not release NO) and that its inhibitory action was not affected by CPTIO, suggests that the inhibition of complex I by GSNO or SNAP most likely occurs via a transnitrosation mechanism. Peroxynitrite is a potent oxidant for various amino acid residues, with its highest reactivity toward cysteine (36Alvarez B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Freeman B.A. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Our results show that ONOO– is a rapid and irreversible inhibitor of complex I activity, as has been reported for rat brain SMP (6Lizasoain I. Moro M.A. Knowles R.G. Darley-Usmar V. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We were unable to see any reversal of the inhibition of ONOO– or SIN-1 by the reducing agents used. Furthermore, blocking of the crucial cysteine residue (as well as many other cysteines) of deactivated complex I with DTNB did not protect the enzyme from inhibition by ONOO–. This suggests that inhibition of complex I by ONOO– may be caused by modification of other amino acid residue(s) or protein disulfide bond(s) besides the cysteine involved in the A/D transition. Oxidation of NADH by the artificial acceptor hexaammineruthenium (HAR) was not affected by treatment with nitrosothiol agents. This is in agreement with previous results with NADH:ferricyanide reductase (8Cassina A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Because the D-form of the enzyme is capable of catalyzing the NADH:HAR reductase reaction, we can assume that nitrosation of the D-form did not cause significant changes in the structure of the D-form peripheral domain of the enzyme or result in disruption of iron-sulfur clusters, and therefore complex I retains its integrity upon treatment. In bovine heart SMP or mitochondria it is known that ∼16 and 25 free SH groups per mg of protein, respectively, are available for covalent modification, although not all of them belong to complex I (24Gostimskaya I.S. Cecchini G. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Beer S.M. Taylor E.R. Brown S.E. Dahm C.C. Costa N.J. Runswick M.J. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47939-47951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Only 35% inhibition of complex I activity upon nitrosation of 10–15 cysteine residues of the enzyme has been found in mitochondria (16Burwell L.S. Nadtochiy S.M. Tompkins A.J. Young S. Brookes P.S. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This probably indicates that most of the modifications are not relevant for the catalytic properties of the enzyme. Although treatment of the A-form of the enzyme with nitrosating agents did not affect its catalytic properties, as functionally assessed by various activity measurements, this treatment undoubtedly resulted in modification of many cysteine-containing subunits. As shown before (23Gavrikova E.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and in this work, the A-form of complex I is insensitive to treatment even by millimolar concentrations of NEM. Most likely, the modification of almost all the surface-exposed SH groups in the active form of complex I by alkylation or nitrosation does not affect the physiological activity of the enzyme. This probably accounts for the minor degree of inhibition of complex I by GSNO (16Burwell L.S. Nadtochiy S.M. Tompkins A.J. Young S. Brookes P.S. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) or ONOO– (38Tompkins A.J. Burwell L.S. Digerness S.B. Zaragoza C. Holman W.L. Brookes P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1762: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) in isolated mitochondria, where complex I is mostly present in its active form. However, the modification of only one cysteine residue of the transmembrane subunit ND3, which becomes exposed to the matrix side of complex I after deactivation, fully inhibits the enzyme. 3A. Galkin, M. Björn, I. Wittig, M. Karas, H. Schägger, A. Vinogradov, and U. Brandt, manuscript in preparation. This different sensitivity of the two forms of complex I to nitrosating agents could explain the difference in the degree of inhibition obtained by various research groups. Although the existence of the A/D transition has been established in different preparations of complex I, the physiological relevance of this process has not been investigated. It is curious that at physiological temperatures the enzyme is required to expend some of the energy released in the NADH:ubiquinone reductase reaction to maintain a catalytically competent conformational state. It is possible that transition from the A- to D-form of complex I may take place during pathological conditions when the turnover of the enzyme is limited at physiological temperatures, such as during hypoxia or when the NO:oxygen ratio increases (metabolic hypoxia) (39Moncada S. Erusalimsky J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). In such a situation the spontaneous deactivation of complex I would result in increasing sensitivity to nitrosating and oxidizing agents such as GSNO or ONOO–, followed by blocking of the enzyme in the D-state. The details of these reactions have yet to be established. Inhibition of complex I by S-nitrosation has been implicated in a number of pathologies, including Huntington, Alzheimer, and Parkinson diseases. Furthermore, decreased complex I activity has been reported in skeletal muscle biopsies taken from critically ill patients in septic shock (40Brealey D. Brand M. Hargreaves I. Heales S. Land J. Smolenski R. Davies N.A. Cooper C.E. Singer M. Lancet. 2002; 360: 219-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Ischemia-specific post-translational covalent modifications of several subunits of complex I have also been found recently after ischemia/reperfusion heart injuries (41White M.Y. Tchen A.S. McCarron H.C. Hambly B.D. Jeremy R.W. Cordwell S.J. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 6221-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the physiological occurrence of two forms of complex I and their interconversion during ischemia/reperfusion has been shown in studies ex vivo (42Maklashina E. Sher Y. Zhou H.Z. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Cecchini G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 43Maklashina E. Kotlyar A.B. Karliner J.S. Cecchini G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The inactivation of complex I may indeed contribute to the reduction of contraction of the heart during ischemic preconditioning, septic shock, and myocarditis (44Monnet X. Ghaleh B. Lucats L. Colin P. Zini R. Hittinger L. Berdeaux A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 70: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because NO is capable of interacting with mitochondrially produced superoxide anion before the latter can be converted by SOD to hydrogen peroxide (45Cudd A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11443-11447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that superoxide production in pathological conditions and in the presence of NO (47Palacios-Callender M. Quintero M. Hollis V.S. Springett R.J. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7630-7635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) would result in formation of ONOO– in the mitochondrial matrix followed by irreversible inhibition of the D-form of complex I that may accumulate during hypoxic conditions. We are grateful to Annie Higgs for help in the preparation of this manuscript."

Biol. 1991; 11: 1846-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When bound to 20E, the receptor complex is converted into a transcriptional activator (2Cherbas L. Lee K. Cherbas P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Palli S.R. Hormann R.E. Schlattner U. Lezzi M. Vitam. Horm. 2005; 73: 59-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The mechanism of juvenile hormone (JH) action remains poorly understood. During larval development, JH modulates 20E action so that a repetition of a larval molt rather than metamorphosis occurs. For this reason, JH is referred to as the “status quo” hormone (4Riddiford L.M. Adv. Insect. Physiol. 1994; 24: 213-274Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 5Riddiford L.M. Arch. Insect. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 32: 271-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the molecular levels, JH is known to modify or suppress the expression of genes involved in 20E signal transduction (6Berger E.M. Dubrovsky E.B. Vitam. Horm. 2005; 73: 175-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Maki A. Sawatsubashi S. Ito S. Shirode Y. Suzuki E. Zhao Y. Yamagata K. Kouzmenko A. Takeyama K. Kato S.

Dev. 2006; 123: 530-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). JH is also known to exert its action through direct influence on gene expression independent of 20E (9Bownes M. J. Insect. Physiol. 1989; 35: 409-413Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Venkataraman V. O'Mahony P.J. Manzcak M. Jones G. Dev.

Science. 2006; 312: 1385-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The involvement of a cell surface-initiated signal transduction mechanism requiring calcium and protein kinase C in JH action was reported (12Yamamoto K. Chadarevian A. Pellegrini M. Science. 1988; 239: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Sevala V.L. Davey K.G. Experientia. 1989; 45: 355-356Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Sevala V.L. Davey K.G. Invert.

Davey K.G. Prestwich G.D. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 267-273Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Currently, there is inconclusive experimental evidence to determine whether the JH-dependent induction of gene expression requires only hormone binding to the cell surface or whether induction is mediated through a receptor-dependent mechanism requiring hormone entry into the cell.Many attempts have been made to identify JH receptors. Jones and Sharp (18Jones G. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13499-13503Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) showed that JH III binds to Drosophila melanogaster USP (DmUSP), a homologue of the vertebrate retinoid X receptor, inducing conformational changes and homo-oligomerization activity. Moreover, DmUSP-specific binding to the DR12 response element transduces JH III signaling in a transfection system (19Xu Y. Fang F. Chu Y.X. Jones D. Jones G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6026-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the estimated dissociation constant for binding of JH III for the USP receptor is much greater than the concentration of JH typically found in either whole body or serum (20Bownes M. Rembold H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Another candidate gene for JH receptor is the methoprene-tolerant gene (Met) found in D. melanogaster (DmMet). DmMet is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS family of transcriptional regulators. Met is involved in the molecular action of JH through binding to JH and/or through partnering with itself or other proteins to control transcription of one or more downstream effector genes. The Met mutants are resistant to the toxic and morphogenetic effects of JH and JH agonist insecticides, such as methoprene (21Wilson T.G. Fabian J. Dev. Biol. 1986; 118: 190-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 22Ashok M. Turner C. Wilson T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the product of DmMet is not vital, as shown by the production of null mutants that are viable (27Wilson T.G. Wang S.L. Beno M. Farkas R. Mol. Gene. Genom. 2006; 276: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Wilson T.G. Arch. Insect. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 32: 641-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Several approaches are being pursued to identify JH receptor. Among them is identification of JHRE to be used for screening expression libraries to isolate JH receptor. Several JH-responsive genes have been identified (30Berger E.M. Goudie K. Klieger L. Berger M. Decato R. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Iyengar A.R. Kunkel J.G. Dev.

Biol. 2002; 32: 1555-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, a JH response gene, JHP21, was identified from Locusta migratoria, and a JHRE has been identified in the promoter region (33Zhang J. Saleh D.S. Wyatt G.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 122: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Zhou S. Zhang J. Hirai M. Chinzei Y. Kayser H. Wyatt G.R. Walker V.K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 190: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Characterization of the protein complex (including a 35-kDa protein, a transcription factor) that binds to this response element suggests that JH induces the association of preexisting proteins to form an active complex, which binds to the JHRE upstream of jhp21 and regulates its transcription (38Zhou S.

(17Kethidi D.R. Perera S.C. Zheng S. Feng Q.L. Krell P. Retnakaran A. Palli S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19634-19642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) identified a 30-base pair sequence (Choristoneura fumiferana juvenile hormone esterase; CfJHRE), located in the 5′ promoter region of the spruce budworm JH esterase gene (from -604 to -574) that showed 100% similarity with the consensus DR4 element (RGRNYANNNNRGRNYA, where R represents A or G, N is any base, and Y is C or T). This element, CfJHRE, is sufficient to support both JH-dependent induction and 20E suppression of this induction.To study the molecular mechanisms of JH action, microarray analyses were performed, and the genes that are induced by JH in cultured Drosophila L57 cells and honey bee Apis mellifera have been identified 3S. R. Palli, unpublished observation. 3S. R. Palli, unpublished observation. (41Whitfield C.W. Ben-Shahar Y. Brillet C. Leoncini I. Crauser D. Le-Conte Y. Rodriguez-Zas S. Robinson G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16068-16075Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Comparative analysis of JH-induced genes identified 16 genes that are induced by JH in both fly cells and bee brains. The promoter regions of 16 D. melanogaster genes were then used to identify a cis-acting DNA regulatory element, JHRE. The JHRE was used in a DNA affinity column to identify two proteins, FKBP39 and Chd64, that bind to the JHRE. These two proteins were expressed in yeast bound to the JHRE. Two-hybrid assays as well as an in vitro GST pull-down assay showed that these two proteins not only interact with each other but also interact with other proteins, DmEcR, DmUSP, and DmMet, known to be involved in 20E and JH action.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—JHIII and 20E were purchased from Sigma. All ligands were applied in Me2SO, and the final concentration of Me2SO was maintained at 0.001%. Trypsin (modified, sequencing grade, lyophilized) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Protease inhibitor mixture and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. Other commonly used reagents were purchased from Fisher unless otherwise indicated.Computational Identification of cis-Regulatory Motifs—The MEME algorithm (42Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, Stanford, CA. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CAAugust 14-17, 1994: 28-36Google Scholar) was used for uncovering common motifs present in the promoter regions of 3 kb upstream of the transcription start sites in 16 JH-induced genes in Drosophila L57 cells. MAST (motif alignment and search tool; available on the World Wide Web) was used to search whether the identified cis-regulatory motif exists at 3 kb upstream of the transcription start site in homologs of A. mellifera in these 16 JH-induced genes.Preparation of L57 Cell Nuclear Extracts and Yeast Cell-free Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Methods recently were followed for the preparation of nuclear extracts from L57 cells (17Kethidi D.R. Perera S.C. Zheng S. Feng Q.L. Krell P. Retnakaran A. Palli S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19634-19642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For yeast cell-free extract preparation, yeast cells harboring pGildaFKBP39 and pGildaChd64 (see below) were grown in synthetic dropout (SD) medium containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose lacking uracil and histidine (SD/-His/-Ura) and pB42ADFKBP39 and pB42ADChd64 (see below) in minimum SD media lacking uracil and tryptophan (SD/-Trp/-Ura) overnight at 30 °C for 16 h. Expression of the proteins was induced by diluting the culture 10-fold in 100 ml of respective SD medium and growing cells for 16 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with cold water. After resuspending the pellet in an extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 600 mm KCl, 10% sucrose, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture tablets, cells were homogenized with acid-washed glass beads in a Bead-beater (2000 GENO/GRINDER; Spexcertiprep Inc., Metuchen, NJ) four times at the highest setting for 30 s each. The sample was kept on ice for 30 s between the two bead beatings. Cell-free extracts were obtained following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatant was collected and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay method described by Kethidi et al. (17Kethidi D.R. Perera S.C. Zheng S. Feng Q.L. Krell P. Retnakaran A. Palli S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19634-19642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was followed.Construction of DmJHRE1 Reporter Plasmids—The following oligonucleotides were synthesized, annealed, and kinased: 5′-TCGACTCGCGCACTCTCTCTCTCTCCCGCTCTC-3′; 5′-TCGAGAGAGCGGGAGAGAGAGAGAGTGCGCGAG-3′. The oligonucleotide contains the 29-bp DmJHRE1 sequence. Flanking the 29-bp DmJHRE1 sequence are SalI/XhoI restriction enzyme sites (underlined). For pMK12(DmJHRE1·1F) and pMK22(DmJHRE1·1R) construction, pMK43.2 as described (43Koelle M.R. Talbot W.S. Segraves W.A. Bender M.T. Cherbas P. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 59-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) was digested with SalI, and the oligonucleotides were ligated to the digested vector. Sequencing analysis shows that pMK12(DmJHRE1·1F) and pMK22(DmJHRE1·1R) constructs have a 1× forward or reverse insert, respectively. In both constructs, a minimal promoter (Adh distal promoter) and β-galactosidase cassette are present downstream of DmJHRE1.For pGL3(DmJHRE1·1F3R) and pGL3(DmJHRE1·6F) construct preparation, the 30-bp CfJHRE element in pGL3JHRE (17Kethidi D.R. Perera S.C. Zheng S. Feng Q.L. Krell P. Retnakaran A. Palli S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19634-19642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was digested with XhoI and HindIII and replaced with the cfjhe gene core promoter, -30 to +15, to get the pGL3MP construct. The resulting construct pGL3MP was cut with XhoI and dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and then the oligonucleotides were ligated to the digested vector. Sequencing analysis shows that the pGL3(DmJHRE1·1F3R) and pGL3(DmJHRE1·6F) contain 1× forward plus 3× reverse inserts and 6× forward inserts, respectively. In both constructs, a firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase cassette is present downstream from the multiple copies of DmJHRE1.Insect Cell Culture and Transfection—Methods recently described were followed for L57 cell culture as well as for cell transfection (16Kethidi D.R. Li Y.P. Palli S.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 247: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For β-galactosidase activity, 5 μl of lysates were assayed using the Applied Biosystems Gal-Screen® chemiluminescent reporter gene assay system (Foster City, CA). For luciferase activity, 20 μl of cell lysates were assayed using the Promega Luciferase™ reporter assay system.Affinity Purification and Identification of DmJHRE1-binding Proteins—Nuclear proteins isolated from JH-treated L57 cells were used for affinity purification of DmJHRE1-binding proteins. Three liters of L57 cells treated with JH III for 24 h were transferred from culture flasks (225 cm2) to 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 450 × g. The pellets were collected, and 5 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm KCl) containing freshly prepared dithiothreitol (final concentration of 1 mm) and 100× diluted Sigma protease inhibitor mixture were added, and the pellets were resuspended gently. After incubation at 4 °C for 15 min, the lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 420 × g. The pellets were then transferred into glass tissue grind tubes and homogenized on ice slowly with 10 up-and-down strokes. Then the disrupted cells were centrifuged for 20 min at 10,500 × g. The crude nuclear pellets were resuspended in 0.6× (v/v) extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25% (v/v) glycerol) containing freshly prepared dithiothreitol (final concentration of 1 mm) and 100× diluted Sigma protease inhibitor mixture and incubated for 30 min with gentle shaking. The extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 21,000 × g. The supernatants were collected and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use.Complementary oligonucleotides synthesized based on the 29-bp DmJHRE1 sequence (5′-CTCGCGCACTCTCTCTCTCTCCCGCTCTC-3′) were phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to produce double-stranded oligonucleotides and then ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The oligonucleotide multimers were coupled to commercial CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's protocol. The prepared DmJHRE1 DNA affinity column was used to purify DmJHRE1 binding proteins using the methods previously described (44Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). From here on, all operations were performed at 4 °C. DmJHRE1 DNA affinity resin (3 ml) was equilibrated in a Bio-Rad Econo-Column with buffer Z (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing 0.1 m KCl. Crude nuclear extracts derived from 3 liters of D. melanogaster L57 cells were resuspended in buffer Z containing 0.1 m KCl and were combined with 500 μg of sonicated calf thymus DNA and incubated for 15 min. The solution (protein/DNA mixture) was passed through the DmJHRE1 DNA affinity resin at 20 ml/h by gravity flow. The resin was washed four times with 5 ml of buffer Z containing 0.1 m KCl. After the buffer reached the resin bed, 3.2 ml of buffer Z containing 1.0 m KCl was added to the column, and the resin was thoroughly mixed with the buffer. The resin was allowed to stand for 30 min, the proteins were eluted, and the major elution fraction of DmJHRE1 DNA-binding proteins (3.2 ml) was collected. 3.2 ml of buffer Z containing 0.5 m KCl added to the column and the second elution fraction of DmJHRE1 DNA-binding proteins (3.2 ml) was collected. The affinity column was regenerated by washing with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2.5 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA (60 ml), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.3 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (40 ml). The DmJHRE1 DNA-binding protein fractions were then combined and diluted to 0.1 m KCl with buffer Z without KCl, mixed with sonicated calf thymus DNA, and reapplied to the affinity resin. The same procedure described above was executed two times for further purification. Finally, the eluted fractions of the DmJHRE1 DNA-binding proteins were concentrated with Millipore (Billerica, MA) Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filters to 30 μl.The eluted samples from the DmJHRE1 affinity column were then digested with trypsin and LC-MS/MS analysis as previously described (45Zhu H. Hunter T.C. Pan S. Bradbury E.M. Chen X. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1687-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The LC-MS/MS data were submitted to the MASCOT server for MS/MS ion search (46Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6711) Google Scholar). The peak lists from the LC-MS/MS spectra were generated by the MASCOT script embedded in the Analyst QS software. The typical parameters used in the MASCOT MS/MS ion search are as follows: Drosophila (fruit fly), maximum of two trypsin miscleavages, cysteine carbamiodomethylation, methionine oxidation, a maximum of 100 ppm MS error tolerance, and a maximum of 0.3 Da MS/MS error tolerance.Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) Preparation and Transfection—cDNA clones for the identified proteins were purchased from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center, Indiana university (available on the World Wide Web). Using the plasmids as DNA template, the individual DNA fragments (fkbp39, 377 bp; chd64, 266 bp) for the proteins to be knocked down were amplified by PCR. Each primer used in the PCR contained a 5′ T7 RNA polymerase binding site (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) followed by a gene-specific sequence: fkbp39 gene, forward primer (5′-AGCGTTTCTCTGTTGGGCTA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TGCTCCTTGCCAGATTTCTT-3′); chd64 gene, forward primer (5′-CTTCTTCGAGGTGCTCAAGG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CAGGCAGATAACCACCGAGT-3′). The PCR products were gel-purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The purified PCR products were used as templates by using a HiScribe RNAi transcription kit from New England BioLabs (Ipswich, MA) to produce the dsRNA according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. The dsRNA was stored at -20 °C.Drosophila S2 cells were grown in 25-cm2 cell culture flasks using Schneider's Drosophila medium from Invitrogen. S2 cells were transfected with SuperFect® lipid (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) using an adaptation of the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded and allowed to settle overnight, and dsRNA was complexed with transfection reagent in Schneider's Drosophila medium without serum. The complex was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then added to the cells from which normal growth medium had been removed. After a 4-h incubation, an equal volume of Schneider's Drosophila medium plus 20% FBS was added to the cell/complex mixture. 72 h after the initiation of transfection, the ligands were added to the transfected cells, and the cells were harvested at 24 h after adding the ligands. The luciferase reporter activity was assayed using the Promega Luciferase™ reporter assay system.Yeast, Insect Cell, and Mammalian Cell Two-hybrid Assays—For the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay, we used the Clontech Yeast Matchmaker LexA system (BD Biosciences Clontech) with the LexA DNA-binding domain plasmid, pGilda, and the B42 activation domain plasmid, pB42AD, and lacZ reporter plasmid, p8op-lacZ, which carries the lacZ gene under the control of eight LexA operators and the minimal TATA region from the Gal1 promoter. DmEcR, DmUSP, and DmMet ORFs as well as the identified protein ORFs (FKBP39 and Chd64) were generated by PCR with Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) from available cDNAs. (The cDNAs of FKBP39 and Chd64 are from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center.) Full-length FKBP39 and Chd64 PCR products were inserted into the plasmid pGilda as EcoRI/XhoI and EcoRI/NotI restriction fragments, respectively. The FKBP39 (full-length) and Chd64 (amino acids 52-188) PCR products were inserted into the plasmid pB42AD as EcoRI/XhoI restriction fragments, respectively.Yeast EGY48 strain harboring the reporter genes LEU2 and lacZ (β-galactosidase) were transformed with plasmids pGildaEcR, pGildaUSP, pGildaMet, pGildaFKBP39, pGildaChd64, pB42ADEcR, pB42ADUSP, pB42ADMet, pB42ADFKBP39, and pB42ADChd64, individually or in combination with the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II kit from Zymo Research Corp. Transformed cells were grown on minimum plates for 3-4 days at 30 °C. Colonies from each plate were transferred to SD/-His/-Leu/-Trp/-Ura plate with X-Gal and incubated at 30 °C; β-galactosidase activity was determined by the time required for colonies to turn blue in colonies derived from the colorless X-Gal.For the insect two-hybrid interaction assay, we used the modified Clontech Mammalian Matchmaker assay system (BD Biosciences Clontech). We replaced the promoter of the constitutive SV40 early promoter Psv40e in both the GAL4 DNA-binding domain plasmid (pM) and the VP16 activation domain plasmid (pVP16) by an Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) IE1 promoter, and the resulting plasmids were designated as pIE1M and pIE1VP16, respectively. The reporter plasmid was pG6KZ-Luc (a gift from RheoGene, Inc.), which contains six consensus GAL4 binding sites and a synthetic minimal promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. DmEcR, DmUSP, and DmMet ORFs as well as the identified protein ORFs (FKBP39 and Chd64) were generated by PCR with Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) from available cDNAs. (The cDNAs of FKBP39 and Chd64 are from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center.) To prepare pIE1VP16FKBP39 and pIE1VP16Chd64 fusion protein constructs, full-length FKBP39 and Chd64 were excised out of pB42ADFKBP39 and pGildaChd64 vectors using EcoRI/XhoI and EcoRI/BamHI restriction enzymes, respectively, and then cloned into the EcoRI/SalI and EcoRI/BamHI restriction sites in the basic pIE1VP16, respectively. To get pIE1MFKBP39 and pIE1MChd64 fusion protein constructs, full-length FKBP39 and Chd64 were excised out of pIE1VP16FKBP39 and pIE1VP16Chd64 using EcoRI/XbaI restriction enzymes and then cloned into the same restriction sites in pIE1M vectors, respectively. All constructs retain the stop codon from the wild-type ORF. A previously established procedure was followed for the transient transfection (17Kethidi D.R. Perera S.C. Zheng S. Feng Q.L. Krell P.

Briefly, various combinations of pIE1M and pIE1VP16 were transfected into the Drosophila S2 cells with the reporter gene pG6KZ-Luc by SuperFect® lipid (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). A second reporter, Renilla luciferase, expressed under the Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus IE1 promoter, was cotransfected into cells and used for normalization. After 4 h of transfection, 50 μl of Schneider's Drosophila medium from Invitrogen containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 1 μm ligands were added. All ligands were applied in Me2SO, and the final concentration of Me2SO was maintained at 0.1% in both controls and treatments. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was discarded, and the cells were lysed in 25 μl of passiv"
https://openalex.org/W1528623936,"Intraneuronal accumulation of phosphorylated Tau protein is a molecular pathology found in many forms of dementia, including Alzheimer disease. Research into possible mechanisms leading to the accumulation of modified Tau protein and the possibility of removing Tau protein from the system have revealed that the chaperone protein system can interact with Tau and mediate its degradation. Hsp70/Hsc70, a member of the chaperone protein family, interacts with Tau protein and mediates proper folding of Tau and can promote degradation of Tau protein under certain circumstances. However, because Hsp70/Hsc70 has many binding partners that can mediate its activity, there is still much to discover about how Hsp70 acts in vivo to regulate Tau protein. BAG-1, an Hsp70/Hsc70 binding partner, has been implicated as a mediator of neuronal function. In this work we show that BAG-1 associates with Tau protein in an Hsc70-dependent manner. Overexpression of BAG-1 induced an increase in Tau levels, which is shown to be due to an inhibition of protein degradation. We further show that BAG-1 can inhibit the degradation of Tau protein by the 20 S proteasome but does not affect the ubiquitination of Tau protein. RNA-mediated interference depletion of BAG-1 leads to a decrease in total Tau protein levels as well as promoting hyperphosphorylation of the remaining protein. Induction of Hsp70 by heat shock enhanced the increase of Tau levels in cells overexpressing BAG-1 but induced a decrease of Tau levels in cells that were depleted of BAG-1. Finally, BAG-1 is highly expressed in neurons bearing Tau tangles in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease. This data suggests a molecular mechanism through which Tau protein levels are regulated in the cell and possible consequences for the pathology and treatment of Alzheimer disease.

Finally, BAG-1 is highly expressed in neurons bearing Tau tangles in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease. This data suggests a molecular mechanism through which Tau protein levels are regulated in the cell and possible consequences for the pathology and treatment of Alzheimer disease. A major molecular hallmark of many forms of dementia, including Alzheimer disease, is the accumulation of highly insoluble intraneuronal protein aggregates composing of the neuronal protein Tau. The Tau protein present in intracellular tangles is hyperphosphorylated and forms a misfolded structure (1Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Tung Y.C. Quinlan M. Wisniewski H.M. Binder L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4913-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar). Tau protein normally acts as a microtubule-binding protein in the axon of the neurons, where it stabilizes the microtubule structure and, therefore, the neuronal morphology. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein inhibits its ability to bind to microtubules (2Xie H. Litersky J.M. Hartigan J.A. Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Brain Res. 1998; 798: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and may lead to aggregation and ultimately cytotoxicity. Some research suggests that Tau protein accumulation, rather than hyperphosphorylation, may be a main culprit leading to toxicity (3Mandelkow E.M. Stamer K. Vogel R. Thies E. Mandelkow E. Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 4Thies E. Mandelkow E.M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2896-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Accumulation of Tau protein can lead to an inhibition of intracellular transport, leading to neurodegeneration (5Mukrasch M.D. von Bergen M. Biernat J. Fischer D. Griesinger C. Mandelkow E.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). In addition, accumulation of Tau may be a precursor to the buildup of phosphorylated Tau. Accumulation and aggregation of Tau protein may be triggered by a decreased ability to degrade Tau in the aging brain. Therefore, mechanisms that regulate the levels of Tau protein are an important area of research in Alzheimer disease. Several groups have recently reported an association between Tau protein and chaperone proteins. Chaperone proteins, including the heat shock protein family, are crucial for the proper folding and maintenance of many cellular proteins. Their chaperone function can lead to a refolding of the substrate protein or, in some instances, to degradation of the substrate (7Dickey C.A. Kamal A. Lundgren K. Klosak N. Bailey R.M. Dunmore J. Ash P. Shoraka S. Zlatkovic J. Eckman C.B. Patterson C. Dickson D.W. Nahman Jr., N.S. Hutton M. Burrows F. Petrucelli L. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 648-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). An important member of this family of proteins is Hsp70/Hsc70. Hsp70 and Hsc70 have nearly identical structure and function, but Hsp70 is induced upon heat shock, whereas Hsc70 is constitutively expressed. Dou et al. (8Dou F. Netzer W.J. Tanemura K. Li F.

Three separate groups further demonstrated that the Hsc70/Hsp70-binding protein CHIP is found within this protein complex and serves as a E3 ubiquitin ligase, therefore inducing 26 S proteasomal degradation of Tau protein (9Shimura H.

This suggests that CHIP may be necessary to induce degradation of aberrant Tau species. In addition, it was shown that induction of Hsp70 by antibiotic treatment can induce the degradation of Tau protein that is phosphorylated on specific amino acids (13Dickey C.A. Dunmore J. Lu B. Wang J.W. Lee W.C. Kamal A. Burrows F. Eckman C. Hutton M. Petrucelli L. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 753-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In light of the effects of chaperones and chaperone binding proteins on Tau protein, possible use of the chaperone system in therapeutics of Tauopathies have been proposed (14Dickey C.A.

BAG-1 is expressed as three isoforms in humans (50, 46, and 33 kDa) and two isoforms in mouse (50 and 29 kDa), all expressed from alternative start codons on the same mRNA transcript (16Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3116-3131PubMed Google Scholar). BAG-1 associates with Hsc70 and can induce substrate release in vitro through activating the ATPase domain on Hsc70 (17Luders J. Demand J. Papp O. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14817-14823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, BAG-1 has been shown to up-regulate the refolding activity of Hsc70 in neuronal cells (18Liman J. Ganesan S. Dohm C.P. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Bahr M. Wouters F.S. Kermer P. Mol. Cell.

Considering the important roles of BAG-1 in Hsc70 function and in neuronal development, we researched the possible interaction and regulation of Tau protein by BAG-1. In our work we demonstrate an Hsc70-dependent interaction between BAG-1 and Tau protein. We further demonstrate that BAG-1 functions to inhibit the proteasomal degradation of Tau protein, leading to an accumulation of Tau protein. Induction of Hsp70 augments the accumulation of Tau protein. We also demonstrate that BAG-1 co-localizes with aggregated Tau protein in an Alzheimer disease mouse model.

Oligos were annealed and ligated into pGSHIN vector that had been digested with BglII and HindIII restriction enzymes. Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting—P19 or HEK-293 cells were lysed on the plate with lysis buffer (140 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cleared cell extracts were obtained by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein levels were determined using Bradford reagent. Equal amounts of protein were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in nonfat milk (5% milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween) for 2 h, incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody for 1 h. Membranes were then developed with enhanced chemiluminescence. Primary antibodies used included Tau-5, AT8 (Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Ambion, Austin, TX), anti-β-actin (Sigma), tubulin (Sigma), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and total ERK (kindly provided by Prof. R.

Immunoblots were quantitated using the NIH imager program. Quantitated results are shown with “n” representing independent experiments performed with independent material. All experiments that were not quantitated and statistically analyzed were performed at least twice unless otherwise noted. Immunoprecipitation and GST Pulldown Assay—P19 or HEK-293 cell extracts were prepared and adjusted to 2 mg of total protein in 1 ml of extract using the lysis buffer mentioned above. The appropriate monoclonal antibody was added, and the mixture was gently rotated for 2 h at 4°C followed by an additional 2-h incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunocomplexes were centrifuged at 1000 × g, washed 5 times in cell lysis buffer, and then eluted from the beads with 40 μl of 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.4. 1 m Tris pH8 was then added to neutralize the buffer. In the nocodazole experiment, to depolymerize microtubules, P19 neurons were incubated with 10 μm nocodazole for 1 h and 15 min before lysis. Brain extract for immunoprecipitation was prepared by homogenizing hippocampus (tissue provided by Netherlands Brain Bank) in a 10-times volume of homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 140 mm KCl). Extract was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation as described above. To express GST-BAG-1 proteins, exponentially growing bacterial cultures were induced to express GST, GST-BAG-1, or GST-BAG-1mut (1-179) using 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacteria were lysed in GST lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing lysozyme and protease inhibitors. The cleared lysate was incubated with glutathione beads and washed 5 times with GST lysis buffer containing 1% Triton to remove nonspecifically bound bacterial proteins. Extract of P19 neurons (5 mg) was incubated with GST fusion protein-bound beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The complex was centrifuged and then washed five times in cell lysis buffer. Specifically bound proteins were eluted from the beads with 50 μl of 1 m KCl wash at room temperature for 30 min. Immunostaining of Fixed Cells—Differentiated P19 cells were grown on coated coverslips with poly-l-lysine. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 4% sucrose for 20 min at room temperature as previously described (21Aranda-Abreu G.E. Behar L. Chung S. Furneaux H. Ginzburg I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6907-6917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 3 min and blocking with 1% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were incubated with primary antibodies for 1.5 h at room temperature, washed, and reacted with a secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or CY3 as necessary. The slides were visualized by confocal laser microscopy using 488- and 545-nm laser excitations for fluorescein isothiocyanate and CY3, respectively. Microtubule Assembly—HEK-293 cells stably expressing Tau protein were collected in phosphate-buffered saline and sedimented by centrifugation at 3000 × g. Cell pellets were homogenized in assembly buffer (100 mm MES, pH 6.9, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors as described in cell lysis above). Homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C to separate nuclei. Supernatant was then cleared of other cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant was collected and then adjusted to a final concentration of 2 mm GTP, 4 m glycerol, and 20 μm taxol. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to pellet microtubules. Microtubule pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Non-microtubule supernatant was also recovered. Phosphatase Treatment of Cell Lysates—Cell lysate of P19 neurons were diluted to a protein concentration of 0.5 μg/μl in phosphatase treatment buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% SDS). Lysate was boiled for 5 min to denature the proteins, and then phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to final concentration of 1 mm. Lysate was incubated with 20 units/ml of alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. SDS sample buffer was added, and the sample was analyzed by Western blot as described above. Emitine Treatment—HEK-293 cells were transfected as mentioned above with plasmids for Tau alone or both Tau and BAG-1-HA. 48 h after transfection emitine was added to the medium to a final concentration of 50 μm for the incubation periods that are stated. 20 S Proteasomal Degradation Assay—20 S proteasomes were purified from mice livers as previously described (22Asher G. Tsvetkov P. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Purified proteins of interest were incubated with the 20 S proteasomes in degradation buffer (100 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) in 37 °C for 30 min. The degradation reaction was stopped with the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to cellulose nitrate membranes and detected by immunoblot analysis. Geldanamycin Treatment and Heat Shock—Geldanamycin (kindly provided by Prof. Yossi Shaul, Weizmann Institute of Science) was added to P19 cells in fresh medium on day 7 of neuronal differentiation at the concentrations indicated. Cells were lysed 24 h after the addition of geldanamycin, and immunoblot analysis was performed. For heat shock analysis, P19 cells differentiated into neurons. At day 8 of neuronal differentiation, cells were incubated at 41 °C for 1 h. Cells were then returned to 37 °C for an additional 12 h incubation until they were lysed, and immunoblot analysis was performed. Immunohistochemistry—Paraformaldehyde-fixed brain slices from the 3XTg Alzheimer mouse model (23Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Kayed R. Metherate R. Mattson M.P. Akbari Y.

Slices were reacted with a secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or CY3 as necessary. The slices were then washed, incubated with Hoechst stain for 3 min, and then fixed on slides. The slices were visualized by confocal laser microscopy using 488- and 545-nm laser excitations for fluorescein isothiocyanate and CY3, respectively. BAG-1 Interacts with Tau Protein in an Hsc70-dependent Manner—To determine whether Hsc70 and BAG-1 can physically associate with Tau protein, we performed immunoprecipitation and GST fusion protein assays. To detect an endogenous association between the proteins, we differentiated the P19 embryonic tetracarcinoma cell line into neuronal cells (P19 neurons) using retinoic acid. P19 neurons express neuronal markers such as neurofilaments, synaptophysin, and Tau protein and exhibit neuronal morphology, including distinct axons and dendrites. Using the Tau-5 antibody, both BAG-1 (29 kDa) and Hsc70 co-immunoprecipitated with Tau protein from extracts of P19 neurons (Fig. 1A). Only the 29-kDa BAG-1 isoform is expressed in the cytoplasm of P19 neurons. Nonspecific mouse IgGs were used as a control, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase did not immunoprecipitate with Tau. In addition, we performed an immunoprecipitation experiment in HEK-293 cells that were transfected with constructs encoding for Tau and HA-BAG-1 proteins. Material immunoprecipitated with the Tau-5 antibody reacted with Hsc70 and HA antibodies in Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Therefore, this association could be repeated in a transfected non-neuronal system. GST pulldown assays were used to further verify the association between these proteins and to determine whether BAG-1 associates with Tau directly or through its association with Hsc70. GST-BAG-1 and GST-BAG-1mut were incubated in the presence of P19 neuron cell extracts according to standard protocols for a GST pulldown. GST-BAG-1mut lacks a 57-amino acid segment of the C termini of the BAG-1 protein, which is mandatory for its binding to Hsc70. As visualized by Western blot, Hsc70 and Tau both were present in the eluate from GST-BAG-1 but were absent from the eluate from GST-BAG-1mut (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the segment of BAG-1 that is necessary for Hsc70 binding is also necessary for Tau association. Because this may indicate that BAG-1 associates with Tau indirectly through binding Hsc70, we performed an in vitro GST pulldown with purified Hsc70 and Tau proteins. Tau protein was present in the GST-BAG-1 eluate only when Hsc70 was added to the reaction (Fig. 1D). This demonstrates that the association of Tau with BAG-1 is dependent on Hsc70 and is likely an indirect association due to its own binding to the Hsc70 protein. Tau protein is expressed as six isoforms in adult brain tissue as a result of alternative splicing. BAG-1 was immunoprecipitated from human brain extract to determine which Tau isoforms present in the human brain can associate with BAG-1. All isoforms of Tau in the human brain tissue were detected in the BAG-1 immunoprecipitate. Therefore, the BAG-1·Hsc70 complex can associate with all isoforms of Tau protein. BAG-1 and Tau Expression and Localization in P19 Cells—To further understand the possible implications of the association between BAG-1 and Tau protein, we performed immunohistochemistry on P19 neurons with antibodies against BAG-1 and Tau to determine their cellular localization (Fig. 2A). BAG-1 was found both in the nucleus and cell body, with little staining in the neurites. Tau protein was visualized strongly in the cell body and neurites. Therefore, BAG-1 and Tau are most likely to associate in the cell body. The expression pattern of Tau and BAG-1 along P19 neuronal differentiation was also examined. The expression of p29 BAG-1 rose linearly throughout P19 neuronal differentiation, suggesting that it may perform important functions in the neuronal system (Fig. 2B). The p29 isoform of BAG-1 is also localized mainly in the cytosol, unlike the p50 isoform. Therefore, cytosolic interactions of BAG-1 may be more relevant in neuronal cells. Tau protein exists mainly as a microtubule-associated protein or a soluble protein (24Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Some reports have also suggested that Tau may be found in the nucleus. The functional consequence of the interaction between BAG-1, Hsc70, and Tau will depend on where this interaction takes place in the cellular environment. We found that BAG-1 and Hsc70 are not found in microtubule preparations from Tau-expressing HEK-293 cells. However, a significant fraction of Tau, BAG-1, and Hsc70 were found in the soluble cytosolic fractions. In addition, Hsc70 and BAG-1 were not detected when tubulin was immunoprecipitated from P19 neurons. Therefore, the interaction between Hsc70, BAG-1, and Tau is likely to occur in the soluble cytosolic environment and not on the microtubules. Disassembly of microtubules in P19 neurons by treatment with nocodazole induced an increase in the interaction between BAG-1 and Tau. This further suggests that non-microtubule-associated Tau binds to the BAG-1·Hsc70 complex. In summary, the BAG-1·Hsc70·Tau complex interacts in the soluble compartment of the cell body. Because the main function of Tau protein is to stabilize microtubules in the axons, the soluble Tau protein found in the cell body may need to be transported or degraded in order not to build up to levels that may form tangles. Therefore, BAG-1 may be involved in these mechanisms, as will be discussed below. Overexpression of BAG-1 Leads to Increased Total Tau Protein—To determine the direct function of the association of BAG-1 and Tau, overexpression of BAG-1 was carried out both in the P19 neuronal system and in HEK-293 cells transfected with vector for Tau protein. P19 cells were stably transfected with vectors expressing either GFP-BAG-1 or GFP alone. P19 neurons expressing GFP-BAG-1 displayed a 2-fold increase in the level of Tau protein as compared with cells expressing only GFP or nontransfected cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Expression of another neuronal marker, NF-68, did not change. Also of interest, the amount of phosphorylated Tau (as determined by AT8 antibody) increased by the same ratio as the increase in total Tau. Therefore, overexpression of BAG-1 had no direct effect on Tau phosphorylation but, rather, on levels of total Tau protein. In addition, expression of HA-BAG-1 in HEK-293 cells increased exogenous Tau levels similarly to the increase in P19 neurons (Fig. 3, C and D). Because the Tau construct is not under the control of the native Tau promoter and lacks the translational regulatory elements of Tau mRNA, this experiment shows that the increase in Tau protein is not due to a transcriptional or translational mechanism. Based on the increase of Tau protein after overexpression of BAG-1, we examined if BAG-1 may affect the degradation of translated Tau protein. HEK-293 cells expressing Tau protein were treated with emitine to inhibit translation, and degradation of Tau protein was followed after increasing time intervals. HEK-293 cells that were co-transfected with both Tau and BAG-1 vectors showed a decreased degradation of Tau protein for up to 3 h of emitine treatment compared with cells transfected for only Tau (Fig. 3, E and F). Therefore, BAG-1 may stabilize Tau protein during the first few hours after translation of the nascent protein. Inhibition of Proteasomal Degradation of Tau by BAG-1—Because previous work has shown that Hsc70 and its binding partners can regulate proteasomal degradation of Tau protein, we hypothesized that BAG-1 may attenuate the proteasomal degradation of Tau protein. First, we treated P19 neurons with MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor. After 24 h of inhibition, Tau levels in control P19 neurons reached similar levels as found in P1"

To evaluate the physiological role of ZNT7, we created a mouse model of Znt7 deficiency by a gene-trap approach. Znt7-deficient mice were zinc-deficient based on their low zinc content in serum, liver, bone, kidney, and small intestine. In embryonic fibroblasts isolated from Znt7-deficient mice, cellular zinc was ∼50% that of wild-type controls. Znt7-deficient mice also displayed some classic manifestations of dietary zinc deficiency, such as reduced food intake and poor body weight gain. However, the mutant mice did not show any sign of hair abnormality and dermatitis that are commonly associated with dietary zinc deficiency. A radioactive feeding study suggested that Znt7-deficient mice had reduced zinc absorption in the gut resulting in decreased zinc accumulations in other organs in the body. The poor growth found in Znt7-deficient mice could not be corrected by feeding the mutant mice with a diet containing 6-fold higher zinc (180 mg/kg) than the suggested adequate intake amount (30 mg/kg). Furthermore, the reduced body weight gain of the mutant mice was largely due to the decrease in body fat accumulation. We conclude that ZNT7 has essential functions in dietary zinc absorption and in regulation of body adiposity.

We conclude that ZNT7 has essential functions in dietary zinc absorption and in regulation of body adiposity. Zinc plays essential roles in almost all aspects of metabolism and is required for the activity of hundreds of enzymes and DNA-binding proteins (1Frausto da Silva F.D.

Zinc has a unique and extensive role in key biological processes, including immune function, growth, development, and reproduction (3Prasad A.S. Ann. Intern.

Human and animal studies have shown that zinc deficiency is associated with anorexia, poor appetite, weight loss, and growth retardation (5Prasad A.S. Annu. Rev.

However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the manifestations of zinc deficiency are poorly understood.In mammals, dietary zinc is absorbed through the epithelium of the small intestine and transported into the bloodstream then to the tissues and cells where zinc is needed. Body zinc homeostasis is tightly controlled, and the physiological zinc concentration is maintained largely through the regulation of zinc transporter systems for either zinc efflux/sequestration (SLC30 family) or zinc influx (SLC39 family).

Kirschke C.P. Zhang Y. Yu Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15456-15463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). ZIP proteins contain eight TM domains and a histidine-rich loop between TM domains III and IV, except for ZIP2, which contains one histidine residue in this region (24Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membrane Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). ZNT proteins function to decrease the cytoplasmic zinc concentration by promoting zinc export to the extracellular space or zinc sequestration into subcellular compartments when cellular zinc concentration increases with the exception of ZNT5 (isoform b) by which zinc can be transported bidirectionally (25Valentine R.A.

On the other hand, ZIP proteins function to bring up the cytoplasmic zinc concentration by enhancing zinc uptake or releasing the stored zinc from subcellular compartments to the cytoplasm when cellular zinc concentration drops (26Wang F.

Similar to the other members of the SLC30 family, ZNT7 contains six TM domains and a histidine-rich loop between TM domains IV and V. The message RNA of Znt7 is detected in many tissues, including liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and small intestine by Northern blot analysis, whereas the ZNT7 protein is only detected in lung and small intestine by Western blot analysis (14Kirschke C.P. Huang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4096-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that ZNT7 is abundantly expressed in the absorptive epithelium of the small intestine (14Kirschke C.P. Huang L. J. Biol.

Cytochem. 2007; 55: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that ZNT7 is localized in the Golgi apparatus and plays a role in the accumulation of zinc in the Golgi apparatus (14Kirschke C.P. Huang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4096-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Moreover, electron microscopy analysis suggested that ZNT7 is dominantly localized in the cis-face or forming face of the Golgi apparatus (28Chi Z.H. Wang Z.Y. Wang X. Gao H.L. Dahlstrom A. Huang L. NeuroReport. 2006; 17: 1807-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ZNT7 in Chinese hamster ovarian cells (14Kirschke C.P. Huang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4096-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) led to a accumulation of zinc in the Golgi apparatus, indicating that ZNT7 may play important roles in delivery of zinc into newly synthesized zinc-requiring enzymes/proteins and/or in the storage of zinc in the Golgi apparatus.Targeted deletions of three ZNT members (ZNT1, -3, and -5) in mice have been reported (12Inoue K.

A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). ZNT1 is the only member of the SLC30 family located primarily on the cell membrane and functions to export zinc to the extracellular space. Expression of ZNT1 is ubiquitous, and loss of ZNT1 function in mice is embryonically lethal (29Andrews G.K. Wang H. Dey S.K. Palmiter R.D. Genesis. 2004; 40: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Homozygous Znt1 embryos died in the uterus by days 9–11 of the pregnancy (29Andrews G.K. Wang H. Dey S.K. Palmiter R.D. Genesis. 2004; 40: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ZNT3 is localized to synaptic vesicles of glutamatergic neurons. Null mutation of the Znt3 gene resulted in a complete elimination of zinc from synaptic vesicles in brain, but Znt3-/- mice display normal electroencephalographic activity (30Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). ZNT5 is the only member of the ZNT proteins having more than 6 TM domains (extra 10 TM at the N-terminal end of the protein). Loss of ZNT5 function results in poor growth, lean body composition, muscle weakness, hunched backs, and osteopenia. In addition, male Znt5-/- mice suffer from cardiac arrhythmia and die of heart block at ∼15 weeks of age (12Inoue K. Matsuda K. Itoh M. Kawaguchi H. Tomoike H. Aoyagi T. Nagai R. Hori M. Nakamura Y.

Pups (0–5 days old) of any genotypes suckled on homozygous lm dams died of zinc deficiency at 5–8 days of age (6Piletz J.E. Ganschow R.E. Am. J. Clin.

Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The defect prevents zinc from being incorporated into mother's milk and, therefore, pups of lethal milk dams die of zinc deficiency before weaning (32Burgunder J. Prud'homme J.F. Brice A. Fontaine B.

The ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to produce chimeric mice in the animal facility of the Murine Targeted Genomics Laboratory at University of California at Davis. The resulting two male chimeras were bred to C57BL/6J females to test for germ line transmission. Agouti offspring were genotyped by PCR using the genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies. Animals heterozygous for the insertional mutation were intercrossed to obtain the homozygous animals and wild-type littermate controls. Pups from intercross litters were genotyped at 2 weeks of age by PCR. Congenic mice were produced by back-crossing the mutated gene into the C57BL/6 strain for ten generations using a genotype-directed breeding strategy (TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The wild-type control (Znt7+/+) line was also established from the last back-crossing.All mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room at 22–24 °C with a 12-h light:dark cycle and fed a standard laboratory chow diet (PicoLab® mouse diet 20) and double-distilled water ad libitum. Where indicated, mice were subjected to different diets in the study. Diets containing a defined amount of metal zinc (38Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Zhang Y. Cancer Cell Int. 2006; 6: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were purchased from Research Diets (New Brunswick, NJ).Mice were fasted 16–18 h before they were killed by cardiac puncture while anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 250 mg/kg trimbromoethanol (Avertin®, Aldrich). Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California at Davis.Isolation of Genomic DNA—Genomic DNA was isolated from either mouse tail clips or primary cultured embryonic fibroblasts using a DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).Genotyping—Genomic DNA was subjected to PCR using primers designed to amplify a 383-bp fragment in the βgeo gene and a 341-bp fragment in the Znt7 gene (Fig. 1). PCR primers and cycling conditions were as follows: LacZ-F, 5′-CGTTTTACAACGTCGTGACTGGG-3′ (in LacZ); LacZ-R, 5′-CCTTCCTGTAGCCAGCTTTCATC-3′ (in LacZ); 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 12 cycles at 94 °C for 30 min, 64.5 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 35 s, and then by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 35 s. The final extension was at 72 °C for 3 min.

The final extension was at 72 °C for 3 min. PCR products were detected by agarose-gel electrophoresis.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from small intestines of Znt7+/+, Znt7+/-, and Znt7-/- mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 10 μg of denatured RNA was loaded into each lane of a 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel, electrophoresed, transferred to a Hybond-N+ Nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA fragment (679 bp) containing Znt7 exons 1–6 sequences in the ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech, BD Biosciences), and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blot was exposed to a film at -80 °C overnight to get the images of the Znt7 transcripts on the blot. The blot was then stripped with 0.1% (w/v) SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS solution at 65 °C until no 32P signal was detected. Finally, the blot was hybridized with a 32P-labeled LacZ cDNA fragment containing 1173 bp 5′-end of LacZ sequences, washed, and exposed to a film at -80 °C.Isolation and Culture of Primary Embryonic Fibroblasts—Znt7+/- (N2/F1), Znt7-/- (congenic), or Znt7+/+ (congenic) were mated, and the females were killed by cardiac puncture while anesthetized after 15.5 days of pregnancy. Uterine horns were removed and rinsed with 1× PBS, pH 7.4. Each embryo was separated from its placenta and surrounding membranes. Head and internal organs were removed from the embryos. After briefly rinsing the embryos in 1× PBS, pH 7.4, embryos were finely minced in a trypsin-EDTA solution (0.25%, 2 ml, Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with gentle shaking. The resulting cell suspensions were neutralized with 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cell suspensions were then plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, and cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. The culture medium was changed after 24-h incubation.Antibodies—The affinity-purified anti-ZNT7 polyclonal antibody was made as described previously (14Kirschke C.P. Huang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4096-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Primary embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in a slide chamber for 48 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.4% saponin (Sigma). Cells were subsequently stained with an affinity-purified anti-ZNT7 antibody (1:100 dilution) followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:250 dilution). Photomicrographs were obtained by a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope equipped with a digital camera.65Zn Accumulation, Uptake, and Efflux Assays in Embryonic Fibroblasts—Cells (passages 3–4 that were cultured over a 2- to 3-week period) were grown to 90% confluence, harvested, and washed once in a cold uptake buffer (15 mm HEPES, 100 mm glucose, and 150 mm KCl, pH 7.0) (17Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in the uptake buffer, and cell numbers were determined by the standard curve method (17Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Tubes containing 1 × 106 cells in 150 μl of uptake buffer were incubated in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for 10 min. For 65Zn accumulation and uptake assays, an equal volume of pre-warmed uptake buffer containing 14 pmol of 65ZnCl2 (specific activity, 0.17 mCi/μg, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN) was added, and the mixture was incubated for the indicated time points. For 65Zn export assay, an equal volume of pre-warmed uptake buffer containing 50 pmol of 65ZnCl2 (specific activity, 0.05 mCi/μg, Oak Ridge National Laboratory) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. 2.4 μl of 0.25 mm cold ZnCl2 (final concentration, 2 μm) was added, and the mixture was incubated for the indicated time points. Reactions were stopped by adding 300 μl of ice-cold stop buffer (15 mm HEPES, 100 mm glucose, and 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) (17Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Cells were collected by filtration on glass-fiber filters (GF/C, Whatman Inc., Florham Park, NJ) and washed three times in the stop buffer (10 ml of the total wash volume). Cell-associated radioactivity was measured with a Packard Auto-Gamma 5650 γ-counter (Packard Instrument Company, Downers Grove, IL).Oral 65Zn Administration—Male mice (N2/F3-4) of both genotypes (littermates) at 6 weeks of age were fasted for 16 h. 1.0 μCi of 65ZnCl2 (specific activity, 0.17 mCi/μg, Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in 250 μl of 1× PBS, pH 7.4, were gavagefed. Mice were kept in cages with free access to the drinking water for 4 h after oral radioisotope administration. Mice were killed by cardiac puncture while anesthetized. Whole blood was collected, and serum was isolated. Tissues, including small intestine, liver, kidney, spleen, brain, heart, and lung, were also collected. 65Zn radioactivities in serum and collected tissues were measured with a Packard Auto-Gamma 5650 γ-counter (Packard Instrument Co.).Immunohistochemical Analysis—The duodenum (a 2-cm segment of the mouse small intestine adjacent to the pyloric sphincter) was isolated from a 5-week-old C57BL/6J mouse. Tissue was flushed twice with an ice-cold 1× PBS, pH 7.4, and once with an ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution made in 1× PBS, pH 7.4. Tissue was then fixed in the ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution at 4 °C overnight. Tissue embedding and sectioning were carried out as described previously (27Yu Y.Y. Kirschke C.P. Huang L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2007; 55: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed with an avidin-biotin peroxidase system (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) using an affinity-purified rabbit anti-ZNT7 antibody as described by Yu et al. (27Yu Y.Y. Kirschke C.P. Huang L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2007; 55: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Expressed ZNT7 was indicated by the deposition of a brown product by using a 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Sections were counterstained briefly in hematoxylin.Tissue Zinc Analysis—Congenic male mice, 5 weeks old, of both genotypes (Znt7+/+ and Znt7-/-) were fed with a semi-purified diet containing 30 mg/kg zinc for 3 weeks. Mice were fasted for 16–18 h before killing. Whole blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding while mice were anesthetized. Serum was then isolated and stored at -80 °C. Mice were killed by cardiac puncture. Tissues, including liver, duodenum, kidney, spleen, brain, skeletal muscle (from the hind limb), and bone (femoral), were collected, weighed, and stored at -80 °C. For tissue zinc analysis, samples were transferred into Teflon-lined digestion vessels, and 2.5–3.0 ml of concentrated nitric acid (trace element grade) were added into the vessels. Vessels were sealed, microwaved for 10 min at 300 watts, and then held at 300 watts for an additional 30 min (115 °C) in a Microwave Accelerated Reaction System (MARS5, CEM Corp., Matthews, NC). The digested samples were then diluted 2- to 3-fold in triple filtered deionized water. The serum samples (100 μl) were digested with 2 ml of 1.0 n nitric acid at room temperature until the solution was clear. Tissue and serum zinc contents were determined by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (Varian, Palo Alto, CA).Total RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—Primary embryonic fibroblasts were grown for 48 h and harvested. The total RNA was purified by a micro total RNA purification kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA using a SuperScript Choice system (Invitrogen).Quantitative PCR Analysis—cDNA was diluted 4-fold, and 2 μl of cDNA was added to a quantitative PCR mixture containing corresponding primer pairs and a FAM-labeled TaqMan probe (Applied Biosystems). The quantitative PCR was performed on a PRISM® ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) in triplicate, and the expression of Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was used for normalization. Copy numbers for the Znt1 transcript were calculated using a standard curve method and normalized to the copy numbers of the Gapdh transcripts as described previously (38Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Zhang Y. Cancer Cell Int. 2006; 6: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Growth Curves—4-week-old male Znt7-/- and wild-type littermate controls were housed individually. Mice were fed ad libitum a semi-purified diet containing 5 (marginal zinc-deficient), 30 (zinc-adequate), or 180 (zinc-supplement) mg/kg zinc carbonate, for 22 weeks. Body weights were measured every other week.Food Intake—Congenic male 5-week-old Znt7-/- mice and the wild-type controls were housed individually. Mice were fed ad libitum a semi-purified diet containing either 30 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg zinc carbonate. Food consumption was measured twice a week for 3 weeks.X-ray Analysis—Mice were anesthetized, and the x-ray image was captured by a Faxitron Specimen Radiography System (Faxitron X-Ray Corp., Wheeling, IL).Body Composition—Mice were fasted for 16 h, weighed, and killed by cardiac puncture while anesthetized. Carcasses were weighed and stored at -20 °C in sealed containers until analysis. The chemical Body composition analysis was done as previous described (39York B. Lei K. West D.B. Mammalian Genome. 1996; 7: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Analyses—Blood glucose levels were determined using a OneTouch UltraMini meter (LifeScan, Milpitas, CA). Serum or plasma insulin and leptin were measured using an ultra sensitive insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and a mouse leptin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, respectively (Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove, IL). Serum total cholesterol and triacylglycerol were determined using cholesterol-E and L-Type triglyceride H assays, respectively, from Wako (Richmond, VA).Oral Glucose Tolerance Test—Congenic male 5-week-old Znt7-/- and Znt7+/+ mice were fed ad libitum a 30 mg/kg zinc diet for 3 weeks. OGTT was performed when mice reached 8 weeks of age. Before OGTT, mice were fasted for 16 h, weighed, and then gavage-fed 20% glucose (w/v) at 1.5 g/kg of body weight. Blood was collected from the tail vein. Blood glucose and plasma insulin were measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the glucose administration.Data Analysis—Results are presented as the mean ± S.D. or S.E. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare the results from 65Zn uptake, accumulation, and efflux analyses between the two genotypes. Two-way repeated analysis of variance was used to compare the results from OGTT and subsequent plasma insulin analysis between the two genotypes. Longitudinal Data Analysis using linear mixed effect model (SAS PROC MIXED) was used for comparison of body weight gains and body compositions between the two genotypes. Student's t test was used in comparisons of two test groups with a two-tailed distribution for 65Zn accumulation in mouse tissues 4 h after oral administration, tissue-associated zinc, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin, and leptin analyses. Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSGeneration of Znt7-deficient Mice—Mouse ZNT7 is a 378-amino acid protein encoded by eleven exons located on the reverse strand of mouse chromosome 3. To generate Znt7 knockout mice, mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) line harboring a insertional mutation in the intron 6 of the Znt7 gene by the gene-trap technology were obtained from the BayGenomics (Fig. 1a) (36Skarnes W.C.

https://openalex.org/W2003368618,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an anticancer approach utilizing a light-absorbing molecule and visible light irradiation to generate, in the presence of O2, cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, which cause tumor ablation. Given that the photosensitizer hypericin is under consideration for PDT treatment of bladder cancer we used oligonucleotide microarrays in the T24 bladder cancer cell line to identify differentially expressed genes with therapeutic potential. This study reveals that the expression of several genes involved in various metabolic processes, stress-induced cell death, autophagy, proliferation, inflammation and carcinogenesis is strongly affected by PDT and pinpoints the coordinated induction of a cluster of genes involved in the unfolded protein response pathway after endoplasmic reticulum stress and in antioxidant response. Analysis of PDT-treated cells after p38MAPK inhibition or silencing unraveled that the induction of an important subset of differentially expressed genes regulating growth and invasion, as well as adaptive mechanisms against oxidative stress, is governed by this stress-activated kinase. Moreover, p38MAPK inhibition blocked autonomous regrowth and migration of cancer cells escaping PDT-induced cell death. This analysis identifies new molecular effectors of the cancer cell response to PDT opening attractive avenues to improve the therapeutic efficacy of hypericin-based PDT of bladder cancer."

Interactions between HFE and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) have been mapped to the α1- and α2-helices in HFE and to the helical domain of TfR1. Recently, TfR2 was also reported to interact with HFE in transfected mammalian cells. To test whether similar HFE residues are important for both TfR1 and TfR2 binding, a mutant form of HFE (W81AHFE) that has a ∼5,000-fold lower affinity for TfR1 than HFE was employed. As expected, W81AHFE does not interact with TfR1. However, we found that the same mutation in HFE does not affect the TfR2/HFE interaction. This finding indicates that the TfR2/HFE and TfR1/HFE interactions are distinct. We further observed that, unlike TfR1/HFE, Tf does not compete with HFE for binding to TfR2 and that binding is independent of pH (pH 6–7.5). TfR2-TfR1 and HFE-HLA-B7 chimeras were generated to map the domains of the TfR2/HFE interaction. TfR1 and HLA-B7 were chosen because of their similar overall structures with TfR2 and HFE, respectively. We mapped the interacting domains to the putative stalk and protease-like domains of TfR2 located between residues 104 and 250 and to the α3 domain of HFE, both of which differ from the TfR1/HFE interacting domains.

Blood. 2005; 105: 2564-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, a mutated form of HFE (W81AHFE), which has ∼5,000-fold lower affinity to TfR1 than the unmutated HFE (14Lebron J.A. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), also down-regulates Tf-mediated iron uptake to the same extent as wild-type HFE in HeLa cells (17Zhang A.S. Davies P.S. Carlson H.L. Enns C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These studies point out that HFE can lower intracellular iron levels independently of TfR1, and lead to the conclusion that TfR1 is not the only modulator of HFE function in regulation of iron homeostasis at the cellular level (17Zhang A.S. Davies P.S. Carlson H.L. Enns C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus HFE likely regulates iron homeostasis by interacting with proteins other than TfR1. The predominant site of HFE expression in the liver is hepatocytes (21Zhang A.S. Xiong S. Tsukamoto H. Enns C.A. Blood. 2004; 103: 1509-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), a homolog of TfR1, is also primarily expressed in hepatocytes (22Fleming R.E. Migas M.C. Holden C.C. Waheed A. Britton R.S. Tomatsu S. Bacon B.R. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2214-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). TfR2 and TfR1 show 45% sequence identity in their ecto- and transmembrane domains. They both bind to Tf but with different affinities (23Kawabata H. Germain R.S. Vuong P.T. Nakamaki T. Said J.W.

Unlike TfR1, which is inversely regulated at the level of mRNA stability by an intracellular iron pool (25Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), TfR2 is regulated at the level of protein stability by a novel mechanism, involving the stabilization of receptor upon ligand binding (26Johnson M.B. Enns C.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4287-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Robb A. Wessling-Resnick M. Blood. 2004; 104: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Chen J. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6201-6209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, while TfR1 knock-out mice die in utero with defective erythropoiesis and neurological abnormalities (29Levy J.E. Jin O. Fujiwara Y. Kuo F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1999; 4: 396-399Crossref Scopus (446) Google Scholar), mutations in TfR2 result in an HH type 3, a rare form of iron overload (30Camaschella C. Roetto A. Cali A. Gobbi De M. Garozzo G. Carella M. Majorano N. Totaro A. Gasparini P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). These differences between TfR2 and TfR1 indicate that the two proteins play different roles in iron metabolism. HH type 1 and type 3 patients show very similar patterns of iron overload. Both groups have increased serum transferrin saturation, serum ferritin levels, and iron absorption at the duodenal level (30Camaschella C. Roetto A. Cali A. Gobbi De M. Garozzo G. Carella M. Majorano N. Totaro A. Gasparini P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 31Roetto A. Daraio F. Alberti F. Porporato P. Cali A. De Gobbi M. Camaschella C. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2002; 29: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This increased iron absorption leads to parenchymal iron overload. The similarities in patients with HH type 1 and 3 suggest that HFE and TfR2 function in the same or parallel pathways to regulate iron homeostasis. In line with these observations, a recent study identified that HFE and TfR2 interact in mammalian cells, the interaction is TfR1-independent, and neither HH type 1- nor HH type 3-associated mutations abrogate the interaction (32Goswami T. Andrews N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28494-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The binding sites of TfR1 and HFE were mapped to the helical domain of TfR1 and to α1 and α2 helices of HFE (13Bennett M.J. Lebron J.A. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, the binding sites between TfR2 and HFE are still unknown, raising questions about the nature of the TfR2-HFE interaction. To test whether TfR2 utilizes similar domain(s) as TfR1 to interact with HFE, a set of TfR2-TfR1 chimeras was generated to measure their interaction with HFE and W81AHFE, the form of HFE that does not detectably co-immunoprecipitate with TfR1 (17Zhang A.S. Davies P.S. Carlson H.L. Enns C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In complementary experiments, chimeras of HFE and another MHC class I molecule HLA-B7, which has a similar overall structure to HFE but no apparent function in iron homeostasis, were generated to map the domains of HFE that interact with TfR2. The presented data show that the interactions between HFE and TfR2 differ from those between HFE and TfR1. Moreover, further experiments reveal that HFE increases TfR2 levels in hepatic cells independent of holo-Tf. Plasmid Construction—The pUHD10-3/TfR2 plasmid, which was used to generate a stable HeLa/tTA-TfR2 cell line, was constructed by partial digest of the pcDNA3.1/TfR2 plasmid with EcoRI and XbaI. The EcoRI/XbaI fragment containing the entire TfR2 cDNA, as well as parts of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, was then subcloned into pUHD10-3. To obtain a plasmid for stable expression of human HFE-FLAG in Hela/tTA-TfR2 cells, the HFE-FLAG cDNA was excised as a BamHI/NotI fragment from the pcDNA3.1/HFE-FLAG plasmid (33Feder J.N.

To distinguish the FLAG epitope tag on HFE from that on TfR2-TfR1 chimeras, TfR1-cd/TfR2-tm/TfR1-ecto-FLAG, and TfR2-cd/TfR1-tm-ecto-FLAG cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3 containing an N-terminal HA epitope tag to produce pcDNA3/HA-TfR1-cd/TfR2-tm/TfR1-ecto-FLAG and pcDNA3/HA-TfR2-cd/TfR1-tm-ecto-FLAG plasmids. The pcDNA3/TfR1-cd-tm/TfR2104–250-HA plasmid was generated by PCR amplification using primers and templates summarized in Supplemental Table S1 followed by directional subcloning of PCR products into pcDNA3 as BamHI/EcoRI fragments.

Chem. 2007; 282: 6201-6209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM) (Invitrogen, Bethesda, MD) supplemented with 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 10% FBS, and 400 μg/ml G418. Hep3B and HepG2 cells were maintained as described above without G418. In all transient transfection experiments, the cells were seeded at 3 × 104 cells/cm2 16 h prior the experiment. The DNA was used at 0.2 μg of DNA/cm2, and a Lipofectamine: DNA ratio was kept in the range of 3–3.75 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) per 1 μg of DNA in all experiments. The transfection medium was replaced with the normal medium 6 h later, and cells were grown for another 42–66 h prior to lysis on ice in NET/T buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1× Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Lysates (50–200 μg of total protein) were precleared with either Sepharose-4B/protein A (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) or immobilized protein G (Pierce) beads for 60 min at 4 °C. The precleared lysates were rotated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies, and incubated with either Sepharose-4B/protein A or immobilized protein G for 2 h. After centrifugation, the beads were washed three times with NET/T buffer, and the proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). To detect W81AHFE/TfR2/Tf complex interactions, the precleared cell lysates were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C with M2 anti-FLAG antibody bound to Sepharose-4B/protein A. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed by centrifugation through NET/T buffer containing 15% sucrose and eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Before loading on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel, the proteins were denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. All samples were subjected to 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose, and immunodetection with mouse monoclonal anti-hTfR2 (1:10,000), anti-HA (1:2,000), M2 anti-FLAG (1:5,000), H68.4 anti-TfR1 (1:2,000), rabbit anti-FLAG (1:1,000), goat anti-Tf (1:10,000), or sheep anti-hTfR1 (1:10,000) primary antibodies, and either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated or fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies. The effect of holo-Tf on the interaction between TfR2 and HFE was studied as described above with the following additions. Precleared cell lysates (50 μg) were treated with PBS or holo-Tf (0.01, 0.1, or 10 μm) for 30 min at 4 °C while rotating prior addition of rabbit anti-FLAG antibody. The pH dependence of TfR2 and HFE association was done as described above with the following modifications. The cells were scraped into PBS (pH 7.4), washed once more, and divided to four aliquots. Each aliquot was washed once in cold PBS titrated to pH 6, 6.5, 7, or 7.5 just before the experiment, and the lysis was initiated by addition of PBS buffers titrated as above, each containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. The lysates were precleared with beads equilibrated with the PBS 1% Triton X-100 buffer at the indicated pH. After overnight immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed with PBS/1% Triton X-100 of the indicated pH. These conditions assured that the different pH was maintained during the entire course of immunoprecipitation experiment. Immunofluorescence—Hela/tTA-HFE-FLAG cells growing on coverslips were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/TfR1-cyto-tm/TfR2104–250-HA for 2 days, washed twice with PBS, and fixed for 15 min with PBS/4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde. After washing three times with PBS and blocking with PBS/10% FBS for 60 min at room temperature, the cells were incubated in 1.25 μg/ml mouse anti-HA antibody diluted in PBS/5% FBS for 60 min, washed 3 × 5 min with PBS, incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor 546 (1:500) diluted in PBS for 60 min, and washed 3 × 5 min with PBS. Coverslips were then mounted in ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen, Eugene, OR).

Chen J. Murchison N. Green F.A. Enns C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The cells were split into two dishes 24-h post-transfection to ensure equal transfection efficiency in the analyzed sets. 24 h later, the cells were treated with PBS or 25 μm holo-Tf for 24 h and then lysed as described above. To test whether HFE also affects TfR2104–250-HA levels, Hep3B cells seeded at 3.6 × 104 cell/cm2 were first transiently transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3/TfR2104–250-HA for 30 h and then split into two dishes to ensure equal transfection efficiency in the following analyzed sets. After 16 h, the cells transfected with pcDNA3 were re-transfected with pcDNA3, and the cells transfected with TfR2104–250-HA were re-transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1/HFE-FLAG for 24 h. Subsequently, each dish was split into two and incubated with or without 25 μm holo-Tf for 24 h. Cell lysates were made as described above, and similar amounts of protein per lane were separated on SDS-PAGE as indicated in the figure legends. The levels of TfR2, TfR2-cd-FLAG, TfR2104–250-HA and actin were quantified using fluorescent immunoblotting as described previously (41Johnson M.B. Chen J. Murchison N. Green F.A. Enns C.A. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2095341699,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a transcription factor involved in physiological processes, but also mediates most, if not all, toxic responses to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Activation of the AhR by TCDD leads to its dimerization with aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT) and transcriptional activation of several phase I and II metabolizing enzymes. However, this classical signalling pathway so far failed to explain the pleiotropic hazardous effects of TCDD, such as developmental toxicity and tumour promotion. Thus, there is an urgent need to define genetic programmes orchestrated by AhR to unravel its role in physiology and toxicology. Here we show that TCDD treatment of rat liver oval cells leads to induction of the transcription factor JunD, resulting in transcriptional upregulation of the proto-oncogene cyclin A which finally triggers a release from contact inhibition. Ectopic expression of cyclin A in confluent cultures overcomes G1 arrest, indicating that increased cyclin A levels are indeed sufficient to bypass contact inhibition. Functional interference with AhR-, but not with ARNT, abolished TCDD-induced increase in JunD and cyclin A and prevented loss of contact inhibition. In summary, we have discovered a novel AhR-dependent and probably ARNT-independent signalling pathway involving JunD and cyclin A, which mediates TCDD-induced deregulation of cell cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W1983372570,"Due to a unique addition to the lever arm-positioning region (converter), class VI myosins move in the opposite direction (toward the minus-end of actin filaments) compared to other characterized myosin classes. However, the large size of the myosin VI lever arm swing (powerstroke) cannot be explained by our current view of the structural transitions that occur within the myosin motor. We have solved the crystal structure of a fragment of the myosin VI motor in the structural state that represents the starting point for movement on actin; the pre-powerstroke state. Unexpectedly, the converter itself rearranges to achieve a conformation that has not been seen for other myosins. This results in a much larger powerstroke than is achievable without the converter rearrangement. Moreover, it provides a new mechanism that could be exploited to increase the powerstroke of yet to be characterized plus-end-directed myosin classes. Due to a unique addition to the lever arm-positioning region (converter), class VI myosins move in the opposite direction (toward the minus-end of actin filaments) compared to other characterized myosin classes. However, the large size of the myosin VI lever arm swing (powerstroke) cannot be explained by our current view of the structural transitions that occur within the myosin motor.

This results in a much larger powerstroke than is achievable without the converter rearrangement. Moreover, it provides a new mechanism that could be exploited to increase the powerstroke of yet to be characterized plus-end-directed myosin classes. Within the myosin superfamily there are at least 20 classes of molecular motors that move along actin filaments (Berg et al., 2001Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. A millennial myosin census.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Myosin motor activity is initiated by binding to actin in a state known as the pre-powerstroke state, in which the ATP hydrolysis products are trapped. Actin binding drives conformational changes that allow sequential release of Pi and MgADP, and is coupled to movement of the myosin “lever arm.” The lever arm is a variable length, extended alpha-helix containing calmodulin (CaM) and/or CaM-like light chain binding sites (IQ motifs). It is attached to a subdomain of the myosin motor known as the converter. The converter itself is thought to rotate as a rigid body, rectifying and amplifying the structural changes within the motor domain. The final position of the lever arm at the end of the powerstroke is reached in the actin-myosin rigor conformation, which is formed following the release of ADP. Thus the magnitude of the myosin powerstroke, often referred to as the stroke size, is determined by the net displacement at the end of the lever arm from its pre-powerstroke position to its rigor position. This structure-based explanation of myosin motor activity is referred to as the swinging lever arm hypothesis (Holmes and Geeves, 2000Holmes K.C.

Sci. 2004; 359: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and is illustrated in Figure 1A. Myosin VI is the only class of myosin that has been shown to move toward the minus-end of actin filaments (Wells et al., 1999Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.-Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Myosin VI is an actin-based motor that moves backwards.Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The myosin VI dimer is capable of processive movement (i.e., can move as a single molecule) along an actin filament (Park et al., 2006Park H. Ramamurthy B. Travaglia M. Safer D. Chen L.-Q.

The mechanism of myosin VI translocation and its load-induced anchoring.Cell. 2004; 116: 737-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and thus can fulfill a number of specialized cell biological functions (Buss et al., 2004Buss F.

Houdusse A. What can myosin VI do in cells?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Underlying its unusual properties are two unique structural inserts within the myosin VI motor. The first of these, insert 1, is near the nucleotide-binding site and is responsible for gating of the myosin VI heads during processive movement, and likely is necessary for anchoring under high loads (Sweeney et al., 2007Sweeney H.L. Park H. Zong A.B. Yang Z. Selvin P.R. Rosenfeld S.S. How myosin VI coordinates its heads during processive movement.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The second insert, insert 2, is a structural extension of the converter subdomain and repositions the myosin VI lever arm (Ménétrey et al., 2005Ménétrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. The structure of the myosin VI motor reveals the mechanism of directionality reversal.Nature. 2005; 435: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The first part (proximal helix) of insert 2 interacts with the converter, whereas the second part binds Ca2+-calmodulin. Insert 2 is solely responsible for the reversal of myosin VI directionality, as its removal causes myosin VI to become a plus-end directed motor on actin (Park et al., 2007Park H. Li A. Chen L.-Q. Houdusse A. Selvin P.R. Sweeney H.L. The unique insert at the end of the myosin VI motor is the sole determinant of directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Bryant et al., 2007Bryant Z. Altman D. Spudich J.A. The power stroke of myosin VI and the basis of reverse directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The structure of a truncated myosin VI with its CaM-containing lever arm (MD-IQ) in a rigor-like state (a state similar in motor conformation to that believed to exist in the actin-myosin rigor complex) revealed the need for additional adaptations in the myosin VI structure to account for the observed movements of the motor (Ménétrey et al., 2005Ménétrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. The structure of the myosin VI motor reveals the mechanism of directionality reversal.Nature. 2005; 435: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The problem is that based on the rigor-like conformation of the myosin VI motor at the end of the powerstroke, and modeling of a pre-powerstroke converter positioning based on myosin I or myosin II structures, the predicted stroke size of the myosin VI MD-IQ would be ∼2.5 nm (Figure 1B and Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). However, the stroke size measured in an optical trap is 11–12 nm (Rock et al., 2005Rock R.S. Ramamurthy B. Dunn A.R. Beccafico S. Morris C.A. Spink B. Rami B. Franzini-Armstrong C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. A flexible domain is essential for the large step size and processivity of myosin VI.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which would necessitate the lever arm movement depicted in Figure 1C. Furthermore, for optimal movement the lever arm swing of myosins should be roughly parallel to the actin filament, which would require a very different position for the lever arm in the pre-powerstroke conformation of myosin VI than would be predicted. In order to account for the observed stroke size of myosin VI, we noted that the lever arm would need to be positioned approximately 180° from its rigor position when in the pre-powerstroke state (Ménétrey et al., 2005Ménétrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. The structure of the myosin VI motor reveals the mechanism of directionality reversal.Nature. 2005; 435: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar and schematized in Figure 1C), which was also the conclusion based on stroke size measurements involving a series of truncations of the myosin VI lever arm and insert 2 (Bryant et al., 2007Bryant Z. Altman D. Spudich J.A. The power stroke of myosin VI and the basis of reverse directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Additionally, earlier studies of full-length monomeric myosin VI led to the conclusion that the rotation of the lever arm would have to be at least 140° to explain the observed stroke size (Lister et al., 2004Lister I. Schmitz S. Walker M. Trinick J. Buss F. Veigel C. Kendrick-Jones J. A monomeric myosin VI with a large working stroke.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We offered two types of models that could account for this discrepancy (Ménétrey et al., 2005Ménétrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. The structure of the myosin VI motor reveals the mechanism of directionality reversal.Nature. 2005; 435: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The first involved an uncoupling of the lever arm in the pre-powerstroke state, and the second called for a unique pre-powerstroke structure. Later experiments ruled out the former and suggested that myosin VI must indeed adopt a different conformation at the beginning of its powerstroke on actin (Park et al., 2007Park H. Li A. Chen L.-Q. Houdusse A. Selvin P.R. Sweeney H.L. The unique insert at the end of the myosin VI motor is the sole determinant of directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Bryant et al., 2007Bryant Z. Altman D. Spudich J.A. The power stroke of myosin VI and the basis of reverse directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Using a truncation of the myosin VI motor in which the CaM-binding region of insert 2 was removed, we have now solved the pre-powerstroke structure of the myosin VI motor (Figure 2). This structure reveals a number of previously unseen structural adaptations that create a unique pre-powerstroke state and explain the large stroke size observed for myosin VI. Furthermore it demonstrates that one assumption of the swinging lever arm hypothesis, that the converter subdomain of the motor always rotates as a rigid structure, is not correct for all classes of myosin.

Crystal structure of the motor domain of a class-I myosin.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2517-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We were unsuccessful in attempts to crystallize these trapped forms of our previously published truncations (MD-IQ and MDinsert 2) of myosin VI (Ménétrey et al., 2005Ménétrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. The structure of the myosin VI motor reveals the mechanism of directionality reversal.Nature. 2005; 435: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), so we further truncated the motor (after isoleucine 789), removing the calmodulin-binding site of insert 2, creating a motor domain (MD) construct. The function of this myosin VI MD construct was assessed by actin-activated ATPase activity at 25°C. The maximal steady state activity was slightly reduced as compared to MD-IQ (4.6 ± 0.3 s−1 and 5.7 ± 0.4 s−1, respectively), with no change in the apparent actin affinity (KATPase). This was due to a 20% slowing of ADP release in the truncated construct (4 s−1 versus 5 s−1). However, truncation clearly did not interfere with the ability of the motor to go through its ATPase cycle on actin. Furthermore, a similarly truncated construct (after serine 791) has previously been shown to have motor activity using a gliding actin filament assay, and also was shown to have decreased ADP release kinetics (Bryant et al., 2007Bryant Z. Altman D. Spudich J.A. The power stroke of myosin VI and the basis of reverse directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The myosin VI MD construct crystallized in a state with MgADP.vanadate trapped in the nucleotide-binding pocket. The crystals diffracted up to 1.75Å, allowing determination of the myosin VI pre-powerstroke structure at high resolution. As shown in Figure 2, this myosin VI pre-powerstroke structure would position the lever arm greater than 140° from the previously seen rigor-like position, as compared to the 70° rotation seen for myosin II (Houdusse et al., 2000Houdusse A.

While the exact lever arm position cannot be determined from this truncated structure, the dotted lines in Figure 2 delineate a range of possible positions. Even with the smallest rotation (red dotted line), the stroke size is clearly much larger than that predicted by previously seen rearrangements in myosin pre-powerstroke structures (see Figure 1B). This is despite the fact that, as shown in Figure S2, the majority of the motor is positioned as in the myosin II pre-powerstroke structures. The exceptions involve the elements that position the converter (known as the relay and SH1 helix) and the converter itself, which is in a previously unseen conformation (Figure 3, Figure 4).Figure 4A New Conformation of the Converter Reorients Insert 2 in the Pre-Powerstroke StateShow full caption(A) The rigor conformation of the converter (left) is compared to that of the pre-powerstroke state (right).

The same surface of this helix (L777-V780-V784-N785) interacts very differently in the two structures, mainly with the helix-loop-helix motif (light green) of the converter. It is clear that “priming” of the lever arm at the beginning of the power stroke is accomplished in part by a bending of a helix contained within a region known as the relay, which in turn interfaces with the converter. As recently modeled (Koppole et al., 2006Koppole S. Smith J.C. Fischer S. Simulations of the myosin II motor reveal a nucleotide-state sensing element that controls the recovery stroke.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a steric clash between another structural element that connects to the converter, the SH1 helix, causes the bending of the relay helix and thus priming of the lever arm. As shown in Figure 3, substitution of bulky side chains in the relay of myosin VI lessens this steric clash, allowing its relay to be closer to the SH1 helix. This decreases the bending of the relay helix as compared with the relay of myosin II, resulting in a 10° difference in the amount of converter rotation, such that the myosin VI converter is less “primed” toward the minus-end of an actin filament in the pre-powerstroke state than is a plus-end directed motor. This helps increase the stroke size, since in its pre-powerstroke state, the myosin VI lever arm needs to be positioned toward the plus-end of the actin filament. While the 10° repositioning of the converter due to the altered relay conformation contributes to the repositioning of the lever arm, the main structural adaptation underlying the large myosin VI stroke size is a rearrangement of the converter itself. Such a rearrangement has not been seen for any other myosin converter, and is possible due to myosin VI-specific structural adaptations illustrated in Figure 4. Note that the interfaces between the converter and the relay and SH1 helices are conserved, demonstrating that the converter remains tightly coupled to the motor during its rearrangements. However all of the helices of the converter reorient in the pre-powerstroke conformation, including the first (proximal) helix of insert 2, which rotates by ∼90° relative to the last helix of the converter. While we have previously suggested that insert 2 might uncouple from the converter in the pre-powerstroke state, this structure suggests that instead it remains tightly coupled, but is reoriented by the overall converter conformational change. As highlighted in Figure 4, the relative movements of the converter helices are made possible by four flexible linkers or hinges (shown in black) and by hydrophobic surfaces on which rotation of the helices can occur. The combination of the 90° rotation of the insert 2 proximal helix within the converter, the 25° rotation of the last helix of the converter, and the overall converter rotation of about 60° between pre-powerstroke state and rigor, accounts for a minimal lever arm rotation of ∼140°, as indicated in Figure 2. Based on modeling presented below, interactions between the lever arm and the converter may contribute to the exact position adopted by the lever arm (Figure 5A). In order to provide a better estimate of the stroke size predicted by the pre-powerstroke structure, we modeled the full myosin VI lever arm onto the structure. The model of the lever arm of the myosin VI pre-powerstroke structure was obtained by superimposing the final residues of the insert 2 proximal helix present in the MD structure (residues 785–788) with those of the myosin VI MD-IQ rigor-like state structure (2BKI; Ménétrey et al., 2005Ménétrey J. Bahloul A. Wells A.L. Yengo C.M. Morris C.A. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. The structure of the myosin VI motor reveals the mechanism of directionality reversal.Nature. 2005; 435: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A small adjustment of the lever arm orientation allowed positioning of the lever arm so that contacts could be formed between the converter and the N-terminal lobe of the calmodulin as exist in the rigor-like structure (Figure 5A). Note that in this model, the myosin VI lever arm is oriented roughly parallel to the actin filament, pointing toward the plus-end. The model results in a lever-arm rotation of ∼180° from pre-powerstroke to rigor, accounting for a movement of 11–12 nm at the end of the lever arm (Figure 5B). If contacts between the converter and CaM are not formed, then the rotation would be somewhat less (>140°), and the lever arm would likely be highly mobile in the pre-powerstroke state. Only the full 180° rotation correctly predicts the measured stroke size for the construct with the full myosin VI lever arm (Rock et al., 2005Rock R.S. Ramamurthy B. Dunn A.R. Beccafico S. Morris C.A. Spink B. Rami B. Franzini-Armstrong C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. A flexible domain is essential for the large step size and processivity of myosin VI.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as noted in Figure 5B, the modeled position of the pre-powerstroke lever arm provides correct predictions for the directionality and reasonable predictions for the stroke sizes of the series of truncated myosin VI constructs characterized by Bryant et al., 2007Bryant Z. Altman D. Spudich J.A. The power stroke of myosin VI and the basis of reverse directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar. Any model that decreases the rotation of the lever arm will lead to increasing discrepancies between measured and predicted stroke sizes. Note that in any event, as illustrated in Figure 5C, this large stroke size cannot entirely account for the observed myosin VI step size of 30–36 nm (Park et al., 2006Park H. Ramamurthy B. Travaglia M. Safer D. Chen L.-Q. Franzini-Armstrong C. Selvin P.R. Sweeney H.L. Full-length myosin VI dimerizes and moves processively along actin filaments upon monomer clustering.Mol.

Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) without some extension of the lever arm, as previously proposed (Rock et al., 2005Rock R.S. Ramamurthy B. Dunn A.R. Beccafico S. Morris C.A. Spink B. Rami B. Franzini-Armstrong C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. A flexible domain is essential for the large step size and processivity of myosin VI.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). An important question is what drives the converter to alter its conformation from the new form seen in the pre-powerstroke, to the more conventional folding seen in the rigor conformation of myosin VI and in all other myosins. Illustrated in Figure 6 is a model demonstrating that the conventional (rigor) conformation of the myosin VI converter can be accommodated in the pre-powerstroke structure (but as previously noted, would reduce the stroke size). However, as also illustrated in Figure 6, the unusual (pre-powerstroke) converter conformation cannot be accommodated in the myosin VI rigor-like structure due to a steric clash with the N-terminal subdomain of the motor. Furthermore, the rigor converter conformation is stabilized by specific interactions with the N-terminal subdomain of myosin VI (Figure 6B). These observations suggest that the pre-powerstroke converter conformation is favored in the absence of constraints, and likely exists in the initial states of the powerstroke. It must be forced out of this conformation and into the conventional conformation later in the cycle, prior to formation of the rigor complex on actin. Indeed, the relatively large heat capacity and enthalpy changes seen with ADP binding to actomyosin VI (Robblee et al., 2005Robblee J.P. Cao W. Henn A. Hannemann D.E. De La Cruz E.M. Thermodynamics of nucleotide binding to actomyosin V and VI: a positive heat capacity change accompanies strong ADP binding.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10238-10249Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) could be indicative of converter rearrangements. In addition to creating a larger stroke size, the converter rearrangements of myosin VI could be influenced by strain, and therefore be exploited for fine-tuning of cellular functions. A recent study demonstrated that during processive movement gating of the lead head of a myosin VI dimer is accomplished by preventing ATP binding (Sweeney et al., 2007Sweeney H.L. Park H. Zong A.B. Yang Z. Selvin P.R. Rosenfeld S.S. How myosin VI coordinates its heads during processive movement.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At the same time, and unlike the gating for myosin V, ADP release is unaffected (Sweeney et al., 2007Sweeney H.L. Park H. Zong A.B. Yang Z. Selvin P.R. Rosenfeld S.S. How myosin VI coordinates its heads during processive movement.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This appears to be accomplished by rearward strain positioning insert 1 in the lead head of the myosin VI dimer so that it restricts the entry of the gamma phosphate of ATP, but does not restrict ADP entry or release. One observation of the study that was difficult to understand was that once the rear head detaches, relieving the intramolecular strain, there was a significant delay before ATP could bind to the lead head. Based on the converter structure described in this study, one possible explanation is that rearward strain maintains the pre-powerstroke conformation of the converter. Once the strain is relieved, the rate-limiting step for ATP binding to the lead head could be a combination of converter rearrangements that allow the rigor state to form, coupled to insert 1 repositioning. Another unexplained property of the processive movement of a single dimeric myosin VI molecule along an actin filament is its highly variable step size (Park et al., 2006Park H. Ramamurthy B. Travaglia M. Safer D. Chen L.-Q. Franzini-Armstrong C. Selvin P.R. Sweeney H.L. Full-length myosin VI dimerizes and moves processively along actin filaments upon monomer clustering.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 331-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, Rock et al., 2001Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Myosin VI is a processive motor with a large step size.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, Nishikawa et al., 2002Nishikawa S. Homma K. Komori Y. Iwaki M. Wazawa T. Hikikoshi Iwane A. Saito J. Ikebe R. Katayama E. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. Class VI myosin moves processively along actin filaments backward with large steps.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). While it has been proposed that this variability might be due to a flexible lever arm extension (Rock et al., 2005Rock R.S. Ramamurthy B. Dunn A.R. Beccafico S. Morris C.A. Spink B. Rami B. Franzini-Armstrong C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. A flexible domain is essential for the large step size and processivity of myosin VI.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), much of the source of the variability recently was shown to reside within the myosin VI motor domain (Park et al., 2007Park H. Li A. Chen L.-Q. Houdusse A. Selvin P.R. Sweeney H.L. The unique insert at the end of the myosin VI motor is the sole determinant of directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This is based on the observation that when the lever arm and coiled coil of myosin V were appended to the last helix of the myosin VI converter, the step size of the plus-end directed chimeric dimer displayed as much variability as for wild-type myosin VI (Park et al., 2007Park H. Li A. Chen L.-Q. Houdusse A. Selvin P.R. Sweeney H.L. The unique insert at the end of the myosin VI motor is the sole determinant of directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus the possibility that the converter of the rear head of a processive myosin VI dimer might be undergoing a transition from its pre-powerstroke to rigor conformation, and thus be in either of its two conformations while the unattached lead head is searching for an actin binding site, could contribute to the highly variable step size. The pre-powerstroke structure presented herein correctly predicts the measured myosin VI stroke size and obviates the need to postulate any type of uncoupling involving either the converter or insert 2. Rather, the converter and insert 2 can maintain connectivity while reorienting their helices. Although converter rearrangements of this sort have not been observed for myosin II or myosin I and have not previously been considered in the swinging lever arm hypothesis, such rearrangements could give rise to larger stroke sizes in the case of plus-end directed myosins. This is illustrated in the model shown in Figure 7, in which the stroke size of scallop myosin II with its complete lever arm would be increased by 50% (from 12 nm to 18 nm) using the pre-powerstroke converter rearrangement found in myosin VI. (This also can be visualized in Figure S1 by noting that the position of the last helix of the converter of myosin VI moves in a plus-end directed manner, consistent with recent studies [Park et al., 2007Park H. Li A. Chen L.-Q. Houdusse A. Selvin P.R. Sweeney H.L. The unique insert at the end of the myosin VI motor is the sole determinant of directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Bryant et al., 2007Bryant Z. Altman D. Spudich J.A. The power stroke of myosin VI and the basis of reverse directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar]. However, the magnitude of this plus-end directed movement is larger than if the converter rearrangement did not occur.) While the unitary displacement (stroke size) increases with lever arm length, the unitary force decreases. Since the converter rearrangement mechanism of myosin VI generates larger movements without the need to increase the length of the lever arm, it may offer a better compromise between maximizing force production and stroke size. Thus it is possible that some classes of plus-end directed myosins that have yet to be examined in detail might use a similar scheme of converter rearrangements to amplify the size of their movements. To create the myosin VI MD construct used to obtain crystals, the porcine myosin VI cDNA was truncated after isoleucine 789. This truncation is at the end of the first (proximal) helix of insert 2, and precedes the CaM-binding site of insert 2. A Flag tag (encoding GDYKDDDDK) was appended to the N-terminus to allow for purification. The construct was used to create a recombinant baculovirus and express protein in SF9 cells, as previously described (Sweeney et al., 1998Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J.

ATPase assays and ADP release from actomyosin VI measurements were performed as previously described (De La Cruz et al., 2001De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L.

Crystals of myosin VI MD were obtained by vapor diffusion method with spontaneous nucleation occurring at 18°C in hanging drops using equal amounts of reservoir solution (containing 3%–4% PEG 8000, 50 mM MES [pH 6.75], 100 mM SAM, 1 mM TCEP) and stock solution of the protein at 6–8 mg/ml. Prior to freezing and data collection, the crystals were transferred into a final cryoprotectant solution containing 8% PEG 8000 with 20% Ethylene glycol.

https://openalex.org/W2076763303,"Glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein (GILZ) is expressed in both epithelial and immune tissues and modulates a variety of cellular functions, including proliferation and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity. A number of reports have described various GILZ activities, focusing on a single isoform with molecular mass of ∼17 kDa, now termed GILZ1. In GILZ immunoblots using a newly developed antiserum, we detected multiple species in extracts from cultured kidney cells. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that one of these represented a previously uncharacterized distinct isoform of GILZ, GILZ2. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to clone cDNAs corresponding to four isoforms, which, in addition to GILZ1 and GILZ2, included new isoforms GILZ3 and GILZ4. Heterologous expression of these four GILZ isoforms in cultured cells revealed striking functional differences. Notably, GILZ1 was the only isoform that significantly stimulated ENaC-mediated Na+ current in a kidney collecting duct cell line, although GILZ2 and GILZ3 also stimulated ENaC surface expression in HEK 293 cells. GILZ1 and GILZ3, and to a lesser extent GILZ2, inhibited ERK phosphorylation. Interestingly, GILZ4, which had no effect on either ENaC or ERK, potently suppressed cellular proliferation, as did GILZ1, but not GILZ2 or GILZ3. Finally, rat and mouse tissues all expressed multiple GILZ species but varied in the relative abundance of each. These data suggest that multiple GILZ isoforms are expressed in most cells and tissues and that these play distinct roles in regulating key cellular functions, including proliferation and ion transport. Furthermore, GILZ inhibition of ERK appears to play an essential role in stimulation of cell surface ENaC but not in inhibition of proliferation. Glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein (GILZ) is expressed in both epithelial and immune tissues and modulates a variety of cellular functions, including proliferation and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity. A number of reports have described various GILZ activities, focusing on a single isoform with molecular mass of ∼17 kDa, now termed GILZ1. In GILZ immunoblots using a newly developed antiserum, we detected multiple species in extracts from cultured kidney cells. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that one of these represented a previously uncharacterized distinct isoform of GILZ, GILZ2. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to clone cDNAs corresponding to four isoforms, which, in addition to GILZ1 and GILZ2, included new isoforms GILZ3 and GILZ4. Heterologous expression of these four GILZ isoforms in cultured cells revealed striking functional differences. Notably, GILZ1 was the only isoform that significantly stimulated ENaC-mediated Na+ current in a kidney collecting duct cell line, although GILZ2 and GILZ3 also stimulated ENaC surface expression in HEK 293 cells. GILZ1 and GILZ3, and to a lesser extent GILZ2, inhibited ERK phosphorylation. Interestingly, GILZ4, which had no effect on either ENaC or ERK, potently suppressed cellular proliferation, as did GILZ1, but not GILZ2 or GILZ3. Finally, rat and mouse tissues all expressed multiple GILZ species but varied in the relative abundance of each. These data suggest that multiple GILZ isoforms are expressed in most cells and tissues and that these play distinct roles in regulating key cellular functions, including proliferation and ion transport. Furthermore, GILZ inhibition of ERK appears to play an essential role in stimulation of cell surface ENaC but not in inhibition of proliferation.

As its name implies, GILZ was first discovered as a dexamethasone-induced transcript in murine thymocytes, which it protects from apoptosis induced by treatment with anti-CD3 antibody (1D'Adamio F.

It is a member of the TSC22D (transforming growth factor β1-stimulated clone 22 domain) family of proteins that are widely expressed and appear to impact multiple biological processes (2Ayroldi E.

Rubin G.M. Development. 1995; 121: 2835-2845PubMed Google Scholar). TSC22D1 (or, simply, TSC22) was first isolated based on its rapid and transient transcriptional induction by transforming growth factor β1 (6Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10219-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is a potential tumor suppressor gene and has been shown to down-regulate cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in human salivary gland (7Nakashiro K. Kawamata H. Hino S. Uchida D. Miwa Y. Hamano H. Omotehara F. Yoshida H. Sato M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 549-555PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hino S. Kawamata H. Uchida D. Omotehara F. Miwa Y. Begum N.M. Yoshida H. Fujimori T. Sato M. Biochem.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and, more recently, its detection at sites of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during mouse embryogenesis (10Dohrmann C.E. Belaoussoff M. Raftery L.A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 84: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggest an important role for this protein during vertebrate development. A similar role has been identified for the TSC22 homologue, bunched, in developing Drosophila larvae (11Levine B. Jean-Francois M. Bernardi F. Gargiulo G. Dobens L. Dev. Biol. 2007; 305: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TSC22D2 and TSC22D4 are expressed in renal cortex, medulla, and papilla and are involved in adaptation of these cells to hypertonicity (4Fiol D.F. Mak S.K. Kultz D. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These two transcripts are significantly up-regulated by hyperosmolality, and overexpression of a specific splice variant of TSC22D2 (TSC22D2-4) in mIMCD3 cells confers protection against osmotic stress-induced cell death (4Fiol D.F. Mak S.K. Kultz D.

Therapie. 2000; 55: 165-169PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, GILZ expression is down-regulated by anti-CD3 stimulation, further suggesting that GILZ contributes to the control of T-cell activation and development (12Riccardi C. Cifone M.G. Migliorati G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Ayroldi E. Migliorati G. Bruscoli S. Marchetti C. Zollo O. Cannarile L. D'Adamio F. Riccardi C. Blood. 2001; 98: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also supports a role for GILZ in the antiproliferative effects of glucocorticoids in T lymphocytes (15Ayroldi E. Zollo O. Bastianelli A. Marchetti C. Agostini M. Di Virgilio R. Riccardi C. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids also up-regulate GILZ expression in macrophages, and GILZ overexpression, in turn, inhibits production of inflammatory mediators and proinflammatory chemokines as well as Toll-like receptor expression (16Berrebi D. Bruscoli S. Cohen N. Foussat A. Migliorati G. Bouchet-Delbos L. Maillot M.C. Portier A. Couderc J. Galanaud P. Peuchmaur M. Riccardi C. Emilie D. Blood. 2003; 101: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although the role of GILZ in immune cell function has been well studied, its role outside of the immune system, until recently, was unknown. In kidney cortical collecting duct (CCD), as well as in mpkCCDc14 cells, a highly differentiated mouse CCD cell line, its expression was shown to be robustly induced by aldosterone (17Robert-Nicoud M. Flahaut M. Elalouf J.M. Nicod M. Salinas M. Bens M. Doucet A. Wincker P. Artiguenave F. Horisberger J.D. Vandewalle A. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2712-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In this cell line, GILZ markedly augments epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)-mediated sodium (Na+) transport (18Soundararajan R. Zhang T.T. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Pearce D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39970-39981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), a process that is central to Na+ homeostasis. Transepithelial Na+ transport involves the regulated functioning of many different pathways and elements that are interestingly shared in several remarkably diverse cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Importantly, GILZ appears to stimulate ENaC cell surface expression at least in part by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK). In the course of experiments aimed at characterizing GILZ function and expression in a kidney collecting duct cell line (mpkCCDc14) using a newly developed antiserum, it became clear that several protein species were expressed, including one prominent species with a molecular mass of ∼28 kDa, substantially larger than the originally identified GILZ isoform, GILZ1. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that this species probably represented a distinct GILZ isoform, and we therefore set out to identify and functionally characterize cDNAs corresponding to this and other expressed GILZ isoforms. Production of Anti-GILZ Antiserum—A rabbit polyclonal antiserum recognizing mouse GILZ was generated to the peptide sequence corresponding to amino acids 111–125 in GILZ1. Peptide synthesis, purification, verification of peptide sequence (by mass spectrometry), conjugation to carrier (keyhole limpet hemocyanin), injection of animals (New Zealand White rabbits), and subsequent boosters were all carried out by Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). Following extensive laboratory characterization, selected bleeds were affinity-purified and used for all subsequent analyses. mpkCCDc14 Cell Culture and Electrophysiological Measurements—mpkCCDc14 cells were maintained in plastic tissue culture flasks in a modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium (“regular medium”), as described previously (18Soundararajan R. Zhang T.T. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Pearce D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39970-39981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. RafestinOblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For electrophysiological and biochemical experiments, the cells were seeded and grown in regular medium on collagen-coated filters (Transwell; pore size 0.4 μm; Corning Costar) until the cell monolayers reached transepithelial resistance greater than 1000 ohms·cm2. They were then maintained in steroid hormone-free, serum-free medium (18Soundararajan R. Zhang T.T. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Pearce D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39970-39981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) for at least 24 h prior to treatment with aldosterone (10–6m, apical and basolateral sides) or an equal volume of vehicle as control for specified periods of time. Following electrophysiological measurements, cells were harvested and processed for protein analysis. U0126 treatment (10 μm) was performed as described previously (18Soundararajan R. Zhang T.T. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Pearce D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39970-39981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in parallel with appropriate vehicle controls (aldosterone was dissolved in ethanol; U0126 was dissolved in Me2SO). Transepithelial resistance and potential difference across the cell monolayers were measured using a mini-volt ohmmeter (MilliCell ERS; Millipore Corp.) at the specified time periods following treatment. The equivalent short circuit current (Ieq) was calculated using Ohm's law (18Soundararajan R. Zhang T.T. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Pearce D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39970-39981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. RafestinOblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amiloride (1 μm) added to the medium completely inhibited this current, thereby indicating its ENaC dependence (data not shown). 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) PCR and Cloning of GILZ Isoforms—Full-length cDNA corresponding to various mouse GILZ (mGILZ) isoforms were cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the SMART-RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA isolated from mpkCCDc14 cells was used for reverse transcription, followed by 5′-RACE-PCR (using 5′-TTA CAC CGC AGA ACC ACC AGG GGC TTC CGG GG-3′ as the gene-specific primer) and subsequent cloning into the TOPOII TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). Following sequence analyses, the ORFs were subcloned into the in vitro expression vector, pMO (described previously (18Soundararajan R. Zhang T.T. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Pearce D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39970-39981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)). An N-terminal Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) was added to facilitate analysis of expression. In Silico Analysis of the Tsc22d3 Gene—The obtained 5′-RACE products were searched via BLAST against the Mus musculus genome on the NCBI site on the World Wide Web, and a region 12 kb upstream and 2 kb downstream of the two most distal matched BLAST results was used for further in silico analysis. Exons were defined by the exact matched BLAST results to the 5′-RACE products and previously reported Tsc22d3 mRNA sequences (available on the World Wide Web), and introns were defined as the genomic sequence between individual exons. The GC content of the Tsc22d3 gene was analyzed using two World Wide Web-based programs, “CpG Island Searcher” (available on the World Wide Web) (20Takai D. Jones P.A. In Silico Biol. 2003; 3: 235-240PubMed Google Scholar) and “DNA Base Composition Analysis Tool” (available on the World Wide Web). Initial promoter description of the Tsc22d3 gene was performed previously by other workers (21Asselin-Labat M.L. David M. Biola-Vidamment A. Lecoeuche D. Zennaro M.C. Bertoglio J. Pallardy M.

For further analysis of the promoter for other putative transcription factor binding sites, TFsearch (available on the World Wide Web), an application on the Helmholtz Network for Bioinformatics (available on the World Wide Web), and MatInspector (available on the World Wide Web) (24Cartharius K. Frech K. Grote K. Klocke B. Haltmeier M. Klingenhoff A. Frisch M. Bayerlein M. Werner T. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar) were used. mpkCCDc14 Transient Transfections—mpkCCDc14 cells (at 70–80% confluence) were transfected with various Myc-mGILZ constructs (5 μg of DNA/2 × 106 cells) or the empty vector alone (vector control) as specified, using a high efficiency electroporation protocol (nucleofection; Amaxa Biosystems Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—GILZ was immunoprecipitated from aldosterone-treated (10–6m) mpkCCDc14 cell lysates using the new anti-GILZ antibody. Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were visualized by Coomassie staining. The 28-kDa band of interest was carefully excised and prepared for in-gel digest with trypsin followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric analysis, according to techniques standardized by the Mass Spectrometric Facility at the University of California (San Francisco, CA) (available on the World Wide Web). Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric analysis per se was performed by Custom Biologics (Toronto, Canada), according to procedures standardized by the company. Purified eluted tryptic peptides were detected by an LCQ DECA XP mass spectrometer (Thermo), equipped with an electrospray ionization source, a low flow metal needle assembly operating in data-dependent mode. The method consisted of two scan events, a full scan and a second data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry scan. The dynamic mass range of the full scan was set at 300–3000 m/z. The resulting tandem mass spectrometry data-dependent scan rejected known “contaminant” masses of 371.0, 391.0, 445.0, 462.0, 1221.89, 1321.9, 1421.9, 1521.8, 1521.9, 1621.9, 1721.9, and 1821.9 m/z. Other method settings included a default charge state set to 4, dynamic exclusion with repeat count set to 2, repeat duration 1 min, an exclusion list size of 25, and exclusion duration of 3 min. All other method parameters were default values set by the Xcaliber software, version 1.2 (Thermo). Using this software, raw sequence data files were searched against the extensive mouse/rat species-specific data base developed by Custom Biologics. Any protein with a peptide match was manually inspected and only accepted if a contiguous y and/or b ion series of greater than 7 residues was obtained. Sequences so obtained were reanalyzed using the NCBI BLAST search in order to confirm identity of the protein. HEK 293 Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK 293) cells were regularly maintained in plastic tissue culture flasks at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. For the transfection experiments, cells were seeded on 6-well dishes and allowed to grow overnight in antibiotic-free medium. They were then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Following 24 h of transfection, cell lysates were harvested for protein analysis. For experiments involving immunofluorescent staining of cell surface and total cellular ENaC, cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in 6-well dishes (∼1.8 × 105 cells/well) and allowed to grow until optimal cell density was reached. Cells were then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and optimized DNA concentrations (200 ng each of α-, β-, and γ-FLAG-xENaC and 250 ng of various GILZ constructs/well). After treatment, the coverslips were removed and processed to detect expression of cell surface ENaC using live cell staining or using permeabilized staining to detect total cellular ENaC, as described previously (18Soundararajan R.

Aiyar A. Carter C. Leis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11199-11204Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Cell surface ENaC was visualized using FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) and goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa-594 fluorophore (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) followed by nuclear co-staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were obtained at ×630 magnification using a Zeiss Axioscope epifluorescence microscope with Metamorph imaging software (Universal Imaging) and filter sets for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (nuclei) and Alexa-594 (FLAG-ENaC). Each experiment was repeated at least three times with similar results. For quantitation, a blinded observer counted the number of cells with detectable surface ENaC, divided by the number of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-positive cells, in at least three independent experiments of cells subjected to live cell staining. The typical number of ENaC-positive cells in controls ranged from 40 to 50 per 100 cells. Cell Proliferation Assays—HEK 293 cells were seeded on 96-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 1 × 104 cells/well and allowed to grow overnight in the absence of antibiotics. They were then transfected with 200 ng of the specified GILZ constructs or the empty vector (control) using Lipofectamine 2000. 24 h following transfection, the cells were treated with 10 μm 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for an additional 24 h. Cell proliferation was then assessed by (colorimetric) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a commercially available BrdUrd incorporation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). All transfections were performed in triplicate, and all experiments were repeated at least four times with similar results. NF-κB Luciferase Reporter Assays—CV1-b mouse kidney epithelial cells (Cell Culture Facility, University of California, San Francisco) were regularly maintained in plastic tissue culture flasks at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium H-16 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, as described previously (26Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar). For NF-κB luciferase reporter assays, cells were seeded on 12-well dishes, allowed to grow to optimal cell density, and co-transfected with 200 ng of the specified GILZ constructs, 250 ng of a reporter vector (NF-κB-LUC) containing tandem repeats of the murine NF-κB site in which the promoter drives the expression of the firefly luciferase (a kind gift from Dr. Warner Greene (Gladstone Institutes)), and 20 ng of the constitutively transcribed RSV-β-galactosidase plasmid, Δ6RL (which serves as an internal control for transfection efficiency (27Meijer O.C. Williamson A. Dallman M.F. Pearce D. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)), using Lipofectamine, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were harvested and processed to assess protein content, luciferase, and β-galactosidase activity, as described previously (26Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar, 27Meijer O.C. Williamson A. Dallman M.F. Pearce D. J.

Since activation of corticosteroid receptors may strongly influence the Rous sarcoma virus promoter, values are presented normalized to total protein content. Each transfection was performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times with similar results. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Protein lysates from cells/tissue samples were prepared as previously described (18Soundararajan R. Zhang T.T. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Pearce D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39970-39981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of transfected FLAG-c-Raf was carried out using anti-FLAG-agarose conjugate (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (18Soundararajan R. Zhang T.T. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Pearce D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39970-39981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), using either our new anti-GILZ antibody or one of the following commercially available antibodies, as specified throughout. phospho-ERK antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). Total ERK antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-SGK1 (serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase-1) antibody was a kind gift from Prof. Gary Firestone (University of California, Berkeley, CA). Anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to assess heterologous expression of Myc-tagged GILZ isoforms. Anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma. Blots were stripped and reprobed for Actin to ensure equality of protein loading (anti-actin antibody; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Peptide Competition Assay—In order to check the specificity of signals obtained, the anti-GILZ antibody was preincubated overnight with a 50 μg/ml concentration of the immunizing peptide and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as primary antibody for overnight incubation with the protein blot (at the same dilution as the original antibody). Statistical Analysis—Data are represented as mean ± S.E. In all experiments involving Na+ current measurements, 3–6 samples were tested, and at least three independent experiments were performed with the same treatment protocol. Unless otherwise specified, all statistical comparisons were evaluated using Student's unpaired two-tailed t test, and significance was defined as p < 0.05. Identification of Novel GILZ Isoforms in Cultured Kidney Collecting Duct (CD) Cells and Animal Tissues—In order to begin to characterize endogenous GILZ protein in CD cells, we developed a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to mouse GILZ (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1A, the antiserum recognizes GILZ in whole cell lysates of HEK 293 kidney epithelial cells transiently transfected with Myc-tagged or untagged forms of mGILZ. Preimmune serum or antiserum precleared with the immunizing peptide (Peptide Competition Assay) gave little-to-no signal, thereby verifying the authenticity of the new antiserum. As a further test of GILZ specificity, we analyzed possible cross-reactivity with its closest relative in the TSC22D family, TSC22D1 (Fig. 1B). The antiserum was found to specifically recognize GILZ but not TSC22D1. Fig. 1, A and B, shows that this new antiserum specifically recognizes heterologously expressed GILZ. We next determined if the new antiserum would recognize endogenous GILZ in mouse kidney epithelial cells. For this purpose, mpkCCDc14 cells were grown on Transwell filters and treated with 10–6m aldosterone for specified periods of time, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Harvested protein lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis indicated that the new antiserum did indeed recognize a 17 kDa band, which comigrated with transfected mGILZ, (Fig. 1C, panel 1); however, several additional bands were apparent, including a prominent ∼28 kDa band, which was also consistently aldosterone-induced (Fig. 1, C and D). A peptide competition assay suggested that these signa"

Using γ-fibrinogen (FBG) as a model of the APR, we investigated the requirement of an IL-6-inducible complex of STAT3 with cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) on γ-FBG expression in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells. IL-6 induces rapid nuclear translocation of Tyr-phosphorylated STAT3 that forms a nuclear complex with CDK9 in nondenaturing co-immunoprecipitation and confocal colocalization assays. To further understand this interaction, we found that CDK9-STAT3 binding is mediated via both STAT NH2-terminal modulatory and COOH-terminal transactivation domains. Both IL-6-inducible γ-FBG reporter gene and endogenous mRNA expression are significantly decreased after CDK9 inhibition using the potent CDK inhibitor, flavopiridol (FP), or specific CDK9 siRNA. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed an IL-6-inducible STAT3 and CDK9 binding to the proximal γ-FBG promoter as well as increased loading of RNA Pol II and phospho-Ser2 CTD Pol II on the TATA box and coding regions. Finally, FP specifically and efficiently inhibits association of phospho-Ser2 CTD RNA Pol II on the γ-FBG promoter, indicating that CDK9 kinase activity mediates IL-6-inducible CTD phosphorylation. Our data indicate that IL-6 induces a STAT3·CDK9 complex mediated by bivalent STAT3 domains and CDK9 kinase activity is necessary for licensing Pol II to enter a transcriptional elongation mode. Therefore, disruption of IL-6 signaling by CDK9 inhibitors could be a potential therapeutic strategy for inflammatory disease. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an IL-6-inducible transcription factor that mediates the hepatic acute phase response (APR). Using γ-fibrinogen (FBG) as a model of the APR, we investigated the requirement of an IL-6-inducible complex of STAT3 with cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) on γ-FBG expression in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells.

Samols D. Sipe J. Kushner I. Folia Histochem. Cytobiol. 1992; 30: 133-135PubMed Google Scholar). Here, cytokines produced at the site of injury activate the de novo expression of genes encoding acute phase proteins (APPs), proteins important in homeostasis, opsonization, and wound repair. Of the APPs, fibrinogen (FBG) is known to play a key role in the APR by mediating hemostasis, participating in clot formation, platelet aggregation and clot retraction (2Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), processes important in promoting tissue repair at the site of injury. The FBG heterocomplex is encoded by three chains; of these, the FBG γ chain (γ-FBG) is of interest because it contains binding sites for platelet integrin αIIbβ3 and leukocyte integrin αMβ2, leading to platelet aggregation and leukocyte recruitment in inflammation (3Hawiger J. Semin Hematol. 1995; 32: 99-109PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ugarova T.P. Lishko V.K. Podolnikova N.P. Okumura N. Merkulov S.M. Yakubenko V.P. Yee V.C. Lord S.T. Haas T.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, its high binding affinities for vascular endothelial growth factor (5Sahni A. Francis C.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 3772-3778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fibroblast growth factor-2 (6Sahni A. Altland O.D. Francis C.W. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1304-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and interleukin-1β (7Sahni A. Guo M. Sahni S.K. Francis C.W. Blood. 2004; 104: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) contribute to wound healing. Finally, γ-FBG contains a fibrin polymerization site, which is involved in fibrin clot formation and platelet aggregation. Because of the crucial role of γ-FBG in multiple processes, the transcriptional mechanisms controlling inducible γ-FBG expression have been extensively investigated.The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has emerged as a major mediator of de novo acute phase reactants synthesis, and for γ-FBG in particular (8Duan H.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41270-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Mizuguchi J. Hu C.H. Cao Z. Loeb K.R. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol.

Here, IL-6 produced and secreted at the site of injury, circulates and binds to the hepatic high-affinity IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)-α. The liganded IL-6Rα then forms an oligomeric complex with gp130 (transducin) and subsequently activates the Janus-(JAK) and Tyk tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine-phosphorylated gp130, in turn, binds the cytoplasmic signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 and -3 isoforms via their Src homology (SH)-2 domains. As additional substrates of the JAK/Tyk kinases, STATs are tyrosine-phosphorylated, allowing them to dimerize via intermolecular SH3 interactions, whereupon they translocate into the nucleus (12Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). Gene deletion experiments have shown that the actions of STAT3 are necessary for inducible expression of a network of APP genes, including C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, angiotensinogen, and γ -FBG (13Ramji D.P. Vitelli A. Tronche F. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Hagihara K. Nishikawa T. Sugamata Y. Song J. Isobe T. Taga T.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 441-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The mechanism of how tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 (pTyr-STAT3) induces gene expression is partly understood. Upon entry into the nucleus STAT3 associates with the p300/CBP coactivator, a protein that acetylates STAT3 on its NH2-terminal modulatory domain to stabilize the STAT3-p300/CBP complex (16Ray S. Boldogh I. Brasier A.R. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1616-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Ray S. Sherman C.T. Lu M. Brasier A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 824-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This complex, in turn modifies chromatin via its histone acetyl transferase activity, serving as an intermolecular bridge to recruit other chromatin modifying proteins like BRG1 (16Ray S. Boldogh I. Brasier A.R. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1616-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Ni Z. Bremner R. J.

The recruitment of an enhancesome results in enzymatic modifications of core nucleosomes, affecting chromatin structure and inducing preinitiation complex formation. By this mechanism, STAT3 controls genes important in diverse cellular functions such as cell cycle control (20Giraud S. Hurlstone A. Avril S. Coqueret O. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7391-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Hagihara K. Nishikawa T. Sugamata Y. Song J. Isobe T. Taga T. Yoshizaki K.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 441-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In this study, we observed that IL-6 strongly induces a nuclear complex of STAT3 with cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and sought to further understand its role in APP regulation using γ-FBG as a model gene. CDK9 is a major component of a complex known as the positive transcriptional elongation factor (P-TEFb) involved in derepression and activation of RNA Pol II (23Garriga J. Grana X. Gene. 2004; 337: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We found IL-6 induces STAT3 binding to CDK9 in a mechanism mediated by both the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of STAT3. Inhibition of CDK9 activity or its expression decrease IL-6-inducible γ-FBG transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments provide direct evidence that IL-6 induces CDK9 recruitment to the γ-FBG promoter along with enhanced RNA Pol II and phospho-Ser2 CTD Pol II loading on the coding region. Moreover, IL-6-inducible Pol II binding is abolished by the CDK9 inhibitor, flavopiridol (FP). Taken together, our data indicate that the IL-6-inducible STAT3·CDK9 complex is essential for γ-FBG induction during the APR. This phenomenon suggests STAT3 promotes transcription elongations as an additional mechanism for induction of APPs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Polyclonal anti-CDK9 (c-20), STAT3 (c-20), anti-phospho-Tyr STAT3 (B7), cyclin T1 (H-245), and RNA Pol II (N-20) Abs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-V5 and FLAG Abs were obtained from Invitrogen and Sigma, respectively. Monoclonal anti-phospho-Ser2 COOH-terminal domain (CTD) Pol II Ab (H5) was from Covance. Anti-Ac-Lys87 STAT3 Ab was described (16Ray S. Boldogh I. Brasier A.R. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1616-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recombinant human IL-6 was from PEPROTECH.Cell Culture and Stimulation—The human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells are maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were serum-starved for at least 16 h before treatment. FP was added 1 h before IL-6 stimulation.Plasmid Construction—For the γ-FBG-LUC reporter, 643 bp of the 5′-flanking human γ-FBG promoter was amplified from HepG2 cell genomic DNA by PCR using the forward primer 5′-CGCGGGATCCCTCCTGAGAAGTGAGAGCCTA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCCCAAGC TTGAGCTCCGAGCCTTGTAGTG-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII, gel-purified, and ligated into the same sites in the pOLUC plasmid (24Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar). The pEF6-V5-STAT3 wild type and dominant-negative (DN) STAT3 were constructed as described before (15Sherman C.T. Brasier A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 441-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The V5 epitope-tagged NH2- and COOH-truncated STAT3 expression vectors (amino acids 1–585, 1–688, 130–770(Δ130)) were previously described (16Ray S. Boldogh I. Brasier A.R. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1616-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The V5 STAT3 (1–130, 1–320, 1–488, and 130–688) expression vectors were produced by PCR and cloned into pEF6/V5-His (InVitrogen). Primers 5′-GGAAATGGCCCAATGGAATCAGCTACAG-3′ and 5′-GTTGGCCTGGCCCCCTTGCTG-3′ were used for 1–130; primers 5′-GGAAATGGCCCAATGGAATCAGCTACAG-3′ and 5′-GGCACTTTTCATTAAGTTTCT-3′ were used for 1–320; primers 5′-GGAATGGCCCAATGGAATCAGCTACAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGATCACCACAACTGGCAA-3′ were used for 1–488; primers 5′-GGTTATGGCAGCCGTGGTGACGGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-TGCCTCCTCCTTGGGAATGTCAGGATAGAG-3′ are used for 130–688. The FLAG-mStraw CDK9 expression plasmid was constructed in two steps. First, the monomeric strawberry (mStraw) cDNA (a generous gift of R. Tsien (25Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E. Steinbach P.A. Giepmans B.N. Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar)) was PCR-amplified using primers to introduce a BglII restriction endonuclease site upstream of the initiator methionine, remove the stop codon and insert multiple cloning sites. The sequence of these primers was 5′-CAGTCAGATCTATGGTGTAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGAATAACATG-3′ (upstream), and 5′-GTCAACAAGCTTGTGGATCCAGCTTTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC-3′ (downstream). The mStraw PCR product was digested with BglII and HindIII endonucleases, gel-purified, and cloned into pcDNA-FLAG (15Sherman C.T. Brasier A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 441-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) digested with BamH1 and HindIII, producing pcDNA-FLAG-Straw. Second, the full-length human CDK-9 cDNA was produced by amplification of oligo-dT-primed cDNA from HeLa cell RNA. The sequence of the primers was: 5′-CATGCAAGCTTGCAAAGCAGTACGACTCTGGTGGAG-3′ (upstream), and 5′-GTCATTCTAGAGGATCCTCAGAAGACGCGCTCAAACTCCGTCTGG-3′ (downstream). The CDK9 cDNA was then restricted with HindIII and XbaI and cloned into the pcDNA-FLAG-Straw plasmid restricted with the same endonucleases, producing pcDNA-FStraw-CDK9. The DN-CDK9 (Asp167 to Asn, D167N) was produced from wild-type CDK9 as a template using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene (26Madore S.J. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3703-3711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The sequence of primers used was (mutations underlined): 5′-CCTGAAGCTGGCAAACTTTGGGCTGGCCCGGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCGGGCCAGCCCAAAGTTTGCCAGCTTCAGG-3′ (antisense). All plasmids were purified by ion exchange chromatography and sequenced prior to transfection.Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For reporter assay, HepG2 cells were plated into 6-well plates and cotransfected with γ-FBG-LUC reporter gene and the transfection efficiency control plasmid pSV2PAP. Twenty-four hours later, cells were stimulated with IL-6 with or without FP pretreatment. Both luciferase and alkaline phosphatase activities were measured 48 h after transfection. All transfections are carried out in three independent experiments. For co-immunoprecipitation, indicated expression plasmids were co-transfected into 10-cm2 dishes using the same protocol. Cells were treated with IL-6 24 h after transfection prior to protein extraction.Preparation of Subcellular Extracts—Sucrose cushion-purified nuclear extract (NE) was prepared as described (16Ray S. Boldogh I. Brasier A.R. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1616-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were harvested in PBS and centrifuged to collect pellets. Pellets were resuspended in double cell volume of solution A and centrifuged to obtain the supernatants as cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellets were purified on sucrose cushions (16Ray S. Boldogh I. Brasier A.R. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1616-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After high salt extraction in buffer C (16Ray S. Boldogh I. Brasier A.R. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1616-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the nuclei were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatants were saved as NE. The protein concentrations were measured by Coomassie dye binding (Protein Reagent, Bio-Rad).Western Blotting—Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk for 0.5–1 h and incubated with indicated primary Ab at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were washed in TBS-0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with secondary Ab at 20 °C for 1 h. Signals were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) or visualized by the Odyssey Infrared Imaging system. β-Actin is used as a loading control.Co-immunoprecipitation—1–2 mg of HepG2 NE were precleared with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of 5 μg of the indicated primary Ab at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were captured by adding 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. After the supernatant was discarded, protein A-Sepharose beads were washed with cold PBS for 4–5 times, and immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE.siRNA Transfection—HepG2 cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well. On the following day, the cells were transfected with either siRNA targeting human CDK9 or the negative control siRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) using TransIT-siQUEST transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h later, the transfected cells were exposed to IL-6 stimulation prior to total cellular RNA extraction for Real-Time (RT)-PCR.Two Step ChIP Assay—Two step ChIP was performed as described (27Nowak D.E. Tian B. Brasier A.R. BioTechniques. 2005; 39: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In brief, 4–6 × 106 HepG2 cells per 100-mm dish were washed twice with PBS after stimulation. Protein-protein cross-linking was first performed with disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, Pierce) followed by protein-DNA cross-linking with formaldehyde. After cells were washed and collected in 1 ml of PBS, pellets were lysed by SDS lysis buffer and sonicated 4 times, 15 s each at setting 4 with 10 s break on ice until DNA fragments lengths were between 200 and 1000 bp. Equal amounts of DNA were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of the indicated Ab in ChIP dilution buffer. Immunoprecipitates were collected with 40 μl of protein A magnetic beads (Dynal Inc., Brown Deer, WI), and washed sequentially with ChIP dilution buffer, high-salt buffer, LiCl wash buffer, and finally in 1× TE buffer. DNA was eluted in 250 μl of elution buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were de-cross-linked in de-cross-linking mixture at 65 °C for 2 h. DNA was phenol/chloroform extracted, precipitated by 100% ethanol and used for RT-PCR.Quantitative Real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR)—Total cellular RNA was extracted by Tri Reagent (Sigma). 2 μg of RNA was used for reverse transcription using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System from Invitrogen. 2 μl of cDNA products were amplified in a 20-μl reaction system containing 10 μl of iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and 400 nm primer mix. All the primers were designed by PrimerExpress v2.0. For γ-FBG mRNA expression, the primers 5′-GGCAACTGTGCTGAACAGGAT-3′ and 5′-GATGGCCAGCGTGACACTT-3′ were used. The sequences of primer sets used in genomic assays are shown in Table 1. All the reactions were processed in MyiQ Single Color Real-Time PCR thermocycler using two step plus melting curve program, and the results were analyzed by iQ5 program (Bio-Rad). For quantitative real-time genomic PCR (Q-gPCR), a standard curve was generated using a dilution series of genomic DNA (from 40 ng to 25 μg) for each primer pair. The fold change of DNA in each immunoprecipitate was determined by normalizing the absolute amount to input DNA reference and calculating the fold change relative to that amount in unstimulated cells.TABLE 1Primer sets used for Q-RT-gPCR in ChlP assayAmplified regionPrimer sequencesForwardReverseIL-6RE1ACAGAGGGACAGGAATGTATTTCCTGGCAGGAGGAGACTGACTTCIL-6RE2CTTAGTTCGAGGTCATATCTGTTTGCAGTCCTGGAGGCTGTGTGATGIL-6RE3GAGCTTCAACCTGTGTGCAAAATCCGTTCCTTTTTCCTCATCCTTATACCTCTCAGGCTCCAATTGTCGTGATCAGCTCCAGCCATTTExon 5ATGCATATGGGATGGCAGACCTGTCTCCTACTGGCACAACAGExon 7CATCAGTTACCTTTCCCAGTGAGAGAAGGTAGCCCAGCTTGA Open table in a new tab Immunofluorescent Staining—HepG2 cells were grown in 6-well tissue culture plates containing sterile coverslips (Fisher). After treatment, cells on coverslips were rinsed by PBS twice and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS three times and treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature prior to immunostaining. All slips were blocked with blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h and then washed once with PBS. The primary antibody was diluted in blocking buffer (1:50 for anti-pTyr705 STAT3, 1:100 for anti-STAT3 (c-20), and 1:200 for anti-CDK9 (c-20)) and applied to the cells on coverslips. Cells were incubated in the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Next day, all slips were washed three times for 10 min each with PBS and then incubated with the diluted fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody (1:100, secondary antibodies for STAT3 and pTyr705STAT3 were from Jackson ImmunoResearch, secondary antibody for CDK9 staining was from Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Cells were washed three times with PBS in low lighting and dried at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted on slides using Dako-Cytomation Fluorescent Mounting Medium and observed under confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510 META system). Images were captured at a magnification of ×40 or ×60.RESULTSIL-6-inducible γ-FBG Expression Is Mediated by STAT3—Previous studies showed that IL-6 potently up-regulates γ-FBG expression in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2 (8Duan H.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41270-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Mizuguchi J. Hu C.H. Cao Z. Loeb K.R. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol.

Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12451-12457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To confirm this finding, γ-FBG expression was measured over a time course of IL-6 stimulation by Q-RT-PCR. A 2.5-fold increase in γ-FBG mRNA abundance was detected as early as 2 h after IL-6 treatment, and the mRNA level continued to increase until a plateau of 12-fold relative to control was observed at 24 h (Fig. 1A). To determine the transcriptional contribution, a luciferase reporter driven by 643 bp of the γ-FBG promoter containing three functional type II IL-6 response elements (IL-6REs) was constructed. This -607/+36 γ-FBG-LUC plasmid was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells and stimulated in the absence or presence of various doses of IL-6 (10 and 50 ng/ml) for two different times (12 and 24 h). For the cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-6, we observed an 8-fold induction of normalized luciferase reporter activity relative to control after 12 h, and 13-fold over control after 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 1B). At 50 ng/ml IL-6, the inducible activity of the γ-FBG promoter was increased by 15-fold at 12 h and 24-fold at 24 h (Fig. 1B). To determine the contribution of IL-6-inducible transcription mediated by STAT3, increasing concentrations of dominant-negative (DN-) STAT3 (Tyr705 to Phe, Ref. 15Sherman C.T. Brasier A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 441-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were co-transfected with the -607/+36 γ-FBG-LUC reporter gene. As little as 0.1 μg of DN-STAT3 decreased IL-6-inducible reporter activity by more than 70% (Fig. 1C). Co-transfected DN-STAT3 had no significant effects on the basal activity of the γ-FBG-LUC reporter gene. Together these data indicated that γ-FBG is an IL-6-inducible gene, mediated at least in part by STAT3-dependent transcriptional induction.IL-6 Induces a Nuclear STAT3·P-TEFb Complex—A series of studies have shown that P-TEFb can interact with various transcription factors or nuclear receptors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) (28Barboric M.

To determine whether STAT3 associates with P-TEFb, HepG2 cells were stimulated in the presence or absence of IL-6 and NE was subjected to nondenaturing co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay using anti-CDK9 as the primary Ab. The immune complexes were fractionated on an SDS-PAGE, and STAT3 was detected by Western blot (Fig. 2A, upper panel). We observed STAT3 binding only in the IL-6-stimulated NE. By contrast, cyclin T1 was also observed in the complex, but there was no difference in cyclin T1 abundance between IL-6-stimulated and unstimulated NEs (Fig. 2A, middle panel), indicating that the CDK9·cyclin T1 complex formation is independent of IL-6 stimulation.FIGURE 2Activated STAT3 complexes with CDK9 in HepG2 nuclear in the presence of IL-6. A and B, STAT3 and CDK9 form a complex in nuclear in an IL-6-dependent manner. Serum-starved HepG2 cells were treated with IL-6 (10 ng/ml) for 30 min, and NEs were isolated using sucrose gradient fractionation. 2 mg of NE were immunoprecipitated by anti-CDK9 Ab or normal rabbit IgG as control. The immune complexes were fractioned by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-STAT3 (A), anti-phospho-STAT3 (Y705) (B), or anti-Ac-K87 STAT3 Abs (C). The blots were then reprobed with cyclin T1 and CDK9 Abs. Because the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was reprobed with anti-cyclin T1 antibody without stripping, the STAT3 band (indicated by * in A, middle panel, second lane) remained in IL-6-stimulated cells. D, the distribution of straw-CDK9 is similar to that of endogenous CDK9. Endogenous CDK9 (upper panel) was stained by a polyclonal rabbit IgG directed against CDK9 and Alexa 568 goat anti-rabbit secondary Ab. For straw-CDK9 (lower panel), HepG2 cells were transfected with pcDNA-FStraw-CDK9 and 24-h later split into 6-well plates containing sterile coverslips. Nuclei were stained by DAPI. E and F, activated STAT3 colocalizes with CDK9 under IL-6 stimulation. Cells were treated with IL-6 (10 ng/ml) for 30 min and then stained for STAT3 or pTyr705-STAT3. STAT3 was detected by a rabbit Ab directed against STAT3 (c-20) and a FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary Ab. pTyr705-STAT3 was recognized by a mouse anti-phospho-Tyr705 STAT3 Ab (B7) and a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary Ab. Straw-CDK9 was transfected and expressed as described in D. Shown is confocal immunofluorescent imaging of representative cells.

https://openalex.org/W2007403856,"Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is characterized by specific chromosome translocations, the most common being t(11;22)(q24;q12). Additionally, other type of genetic abnormalities may occur and be relevant for explaining the variable tumour biology and clinical outcome. We have carried out a high-resolution array CGH and expression profiling on 25 ES tumour samples to characterize the DNA copy number aberrations (CNA) occurring in these tumours and determine their association with gene-expression profiles and clinical outcome. CNA were observed in 84% of the cases. We observed a median number of three aberrations per case. Besides numerical chromosome changes, smaller aberrations were found and defined at chromosomes 5p, 7q and 9p. All CNA were compiled to define the smallest overlapping regions of imbalance (SORI). A total of 35 SORI were delimited. Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to identify subgroups according to the pattern of genomic instability. Unsupervised and supervised clustering analysis (using SORI as variables) segregated the tumours in two distinct groups: one genomically stable (⩽3 CNA) and other genomically unstable (>3 CNA). The genomic unstable group showed a statistically significant shorter overall survival and was more refractory to chemotherapy. Expression profile analysis revealed significant differences between both groups. Genes related with chromosome segregation, DNA repair pathways and cell-cycle control were upregulated in the genomically unstable group. This report elucidates, for the first time, data about genomic instability in ES, based on CNA and expression profiling, and shows that a genomically unstable group of Ewing's tumours is correlated with a significant poor prognosis."

These clinical trials were all conducted in the UK in healthy, HIV negative, BCG naïve adults. Subjects were vaccinated with BCG alone; or BCG and then subsequently boosted with MVA85A four weeks later (short interval). The outcome measures, safety and immunogenicity, were monitored for six months. The immunogenicity results from this short interval BCG prime-MVA85A boost trial were compared first with the BCG alone trial and second with a previous clinical trial where MVA85A vaccination was administered many years after vaccination with BCG.MVA85A was safe and highly immunogenic when administered to subjects who had recently received BCG vaccination. When the short interval trial data presented here were compared with the previous long interval trial data, there were no significant differences in the magnitude of immune responses generated when MVA85A was administered shortly after, or many years after BCG vaccination.The clinical trial data presented here provides further evidence of the ability of MVA85A to boost BCG primed immune responses. This boosting potential is not influenced by the time interval between prior BCG vaccination and boosting with MVA85A. These findings have important implications for the design of efficacy trials with MVA85A. Boosting BCG induced anti-mycobacterial immunity in either infancy or adolescence are both potential applications for this vaccine, given the immunological data presented here.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00427453 (short boosting interval), NCT00427830 (long boosting interval), NCT00480714 (BCG alone)."
https://openalex.org/W1969653941,"Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is a bone matrix glycoprotein whose expression coincides with terminal osteoblastic differentiation and the onset of mineralization. In this study we show that BSP expression is considerably increased in confluent Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cells and in differentiating normal human osteoblasts, concomitantly with the decrease of Runx2, a key transcription factor controlling bone formation. Therefore, we investigated the role of Runx2 in the regulation of BSP expression in Saos-2 cells. Using a mobility shift assay, we demonstrated that Runx2 binds to the BSP promoter only in preconfluent cells. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has been recently shown to act as a Runx2 co-repressor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that both Runx2 and HDAC3 are detectable at the BSP promoter in preconfluent Saos-2 cells but not when they are confluent and overexpress BSP. Consistently, nuclear Runx2 protein level is down-regulated, whereas Saos-2 cells became increasingly confluent. Finally, the suppression of HDAC3, Runx2, or both by RNA interference induced the expression of BSP at both mRNA and protein levels in Saos-2 cells. Our data demonstrate that Runx2 and HDAC3 repress BSP gene expression and that this repression is suspended upon osteoblastic cell differentiation. Both the nuclear disappearance of Runx2 and the non-recruitment of HDAC3 represent new means to relieve Runx2-mediated suppression of BSP expression, thus allowing the acquisition of a fully differentiated and mineralization-competent phenotype by osteoblast cells.

Because it is well established that BSP is a marker of osteoblastic differentiation and considering that Runx2 null mice do not express BSP (19Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K.

Far from the concept that Runx2 is a positive transcriptional regulator necessary to osseous gene expression, it now appears from several studies that Runx2 acts as a dual positive/negative regulator of gene expression depending on which cofactor is recruited. For example, when it is associated with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) at the OC promoter, Runx2 is able to repress OC expression in rat osteoblast cell lines (31Schroeder T.M. Kahler R.A. Li X. Westendorf J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41998-42007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). RNA-mediated interference-mediated suppression of HDAC3 in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts accelerates mineralization and expression of OC, osteopontin, and BSP (31Schroeder T.M. Kahler R.A. Li X.

HDAC3, is a class I member of the HDAC family, which are enzymes recruited by transcription factors to specific DNA regulatory sequences (32Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P.

Active expression of osteoblastic genes in mature osteoblasts and confluent ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells has been previously shown to involve histone H3 and H4 acetylation (35Shen J. Hovhannisyan H. Lian J.B. Montecino M.A. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 743-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Accordingly, HDACs inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA) and valproic acid promote osteoblast maturation (36Schroeder T.M. Westendorf J.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 2254-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 37Lee H.W. Suh J.H. Kim A.Y. Lee Y.S. Park S.Y. Kim J.B. Mol.

These observations prompted us to investigate the mechanism(s) through which BSP gene expression is considerably induced at the onset of mineralization and whether Runx2 and HDAC3 might intervene in this regulation. To answer these questions we used a Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cell culture model because it has been previously shown that these cells are able to undergo osteogenic differentiation and express BSP when forming mineralized tissue nodules in response to prolonged confluent culture (38McQuillan D.J. Richardson M.D. Bateman J.F. Bone (NY). 1995; 16: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Indeed, these cells have been largely used as an osteoblast-like model on the basis of their (i) alkaline phosphatase and osteonectin production (39Murray E. Provvedini D. Curran D. Catherwood B. Sussman H. Manolagas S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 40Villarreal X.C. Mann K.G. Long G.L.

Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4961-4966PubMed Google Scholar). Another advantage of the Saos-2 model is the fact that neither Runx1 nor Runx3 was detected in Saos-2 cells (25Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 29Hoshi K. Komori T. Ozawa H.

Commun. 2001; 286: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and as such, this cell line represents one of the best cell lines available to specifically study gene regulation by Runx2. In this study, we first demonstrated that endogenous BSP expression is significantly increased at both mRNA and protein levels along with confluence in the Saos-2 osteoblastic maturation model but also in normal human osteoblasts cultured in a differentiation medium. Taking advantage of the important induction of BSP expression in confluent versus pre-confluent Saos-2 cells, we next used mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques to compare the status of Runx2 and HDAC3 binding at the BSP promoter under both states of confluence. We found that at least one of the two putative Runx2 binding sites present in human BSP proximal promoter effectively binds Runx2 in pre-confluent Saos-2 cells and, to a far lower extent, in confluent cells. Consistently, when active expression of BSP is turned on in postconfluent cells, Runx2 is not detectable anymore in the nucleus using both Western blot and immunofluorescence techniques. In vivo, immunoprecipitated Runx2 and HDAC3 are not present at the BSP promoter when Saos-2 cells become postconfluent. Finally, the suppression of Runx2, HDAC3, or both by RNA interference in preconfluent Saos-2 cells induces an increase in BSP expression. Our data demonstrate for the first time that Runx2 and HDAC3 exert a suppressive activity on BSP gene expression in human osteoblast cells that must be suspended in a specific and timely manner during osteoblast maturation to allow high BSP expression. Cell Culture—Human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells were routinely grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured to different confluences: preconfluent (∼50% confluence), confluent (∼100% confluence), and postconfluent (confluent + 10 days of culture) and (confluent + 20 days of culture) when mentioned. Normal human osteoblasts were isolated from trabecular bone specimens obtained from patients undergoing knee replacement surgery. Bones were cut into small fragments, washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then submitted to enzymatic digestions as previously described (44Sanchez C. Deberg M.A. Piccardi N. Msika P. Reginster J.Y. Henrotin Y.E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2005; 13: 988-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, small pieces of bone (2 mm3) were sequentially incubated with 0.5 mg/ml hyaluronidase type IV S (Sigma Aldrich) for 20 min at 37 °C and 0.6 mg/ml clostridial collagenase IA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 and 240 min successively at 37 °C (2 g of bone in 20 ml of enzymatic solution). The digested bone pieces were plated in T75 flasks and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin until osteoblasts migrated out of bone explants. At this point the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. When confluent, cells were collected and seeded in T75 flasks. Twenty-four hours after plating, the osteogenic differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 ng/ml ascorbic acid) was added, and that point was designated day 0. At the end of this differentiation period, cells showed an osteoblastic phenotype characterized by the production of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase.

Polyclonal anti-p27 and anti-acetylhistone H3 were purchased from BD Biosciences and from Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA) respectively. The polyclonal anti-HDAC3 was from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Polyclonal anti-Runx2 used for the mobility shift assay, immunoprecipitation, and the Western blot was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Antibodies directed against β-actin and tubulin were obtained from Sigma, and rabbit IgG was from Serotech (Burlington, ON, Canada). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene-difluoride Western blotting membrane (Roche Diagnostics). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 solution for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies. After washing, blots were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 min. Blots were washed again and incubated in an ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Tubulin was used as a cytoplasmic marker and β-actin as a control for equivalent protein loading. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Saos-2 cells grown to the indicated density were transfected with the indicated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or treated with 500 nm of TSA for 3 h. Formaldehyde was then added to the cell medium to a final concentration of 1%, and the cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with gentle shaking; glycine was added to a final concentration of 0.125 m, and cells were shaken for another 5 min. After removal of the medium, cells were washed twice in 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were spun for 4 min at 2000 rpm at 4 °C, and pellets were resuspended in a cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, (pH 8), 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The lysates were spun for 5 min at 4000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in a nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitors) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The lysates were sonicated, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4000 rpm at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Supernatant fractions were diluted 5-fold in a ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Each sample corresponded approximately to 2 × 106 cells. To reduce nonspecific background, each chromatin solution was precleared with 80 μlof salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4°C with agitation. After the addition of antibodies, samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immunocomplexes were collected with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Washes were done sequentially with the following; 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 150 mm NaCl; the same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl; 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1); Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0 (twice). Immunocomplexes were collected by repeated elutions with 250 μl of 1% SDS in 0.1 m NaHCO3. NaCl was added to the combined eluates to a final concentration of 0.3 m, and protein-DNA was reverse cross-linked at 65 °C ON. RNase A (final concentration of 1 mg/ml) was added at 37 °C for 30 min. EDTA, Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), and proteinase K were added at a final concentration of 10 mm, 40 mm, and 40 μg/ml respectively, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 45°C. DNA was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Fractions of the purified ChIP DNA (20%) or input (2%) were used for PCR analysis. Primers for PCR amplification of the BSP proximal promoter region DNA were 5′-ACATATTCGGAGCCCAAACTATTCA and 5′-GAACGTGGATTCTCACCAGAAAAC. PCRs were carried out for 27 cycles or 35 cycles when mentioned (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s), and final products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized under ultraviolet light. Nuclear Protein Extracts—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared according to the Dignam method (46Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9154) Google Scholar). Briefly, Saos-2 cells were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in washing buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) by gentle pipetting. The pellet was collected by centrifugation during 2 min and resuspended in an Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors and incubated on ice for 30 s. The nuclei pellet was collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in washing buffer. The pellet was again collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 2 min, resuspended in an extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 630 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors), and rocked in the cold room for 45 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Aliquots of the supernatant containing nuclear proteins were stored at–80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay reagent (Micro BCA protein assay kit, Pierce). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Double-stranded oligonucleotidic probes were end-labeled by filling with Klenow enzyme (Invitrogen). The labeled probes were purified using a quick spin G25 Sephadex column (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EMSA reaction mixtures were prepared using 100 fmol of probe, 50 mm KCl, 12 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), poly(dI-dC), and 5 μgof nuclear protein. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, aliquots were loaded onto 6% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was electrophoresed for 2 h at 180V, dried, and exposed to film for autoradiography. Probes used for the gel shift analysis included human BSP Runx2 sites (in bold); R1 Runx2 probe, 5′-TCTGGTGAGAATCCACGTTCTGACA; R2 Runx2 probe, 5′-TCAATTAAATTCCACAATGCAAACCT. The probe comprising the consensus Runx2 site of the osteocalcin promoter, 5′-GCTGCAGTCACCAACCACAGCATCCTTTGG, was used as a positive control (14Barnes G.L. Javed A. Waller S.M. Kamal M.H. Hebert K.E.

For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts and probes were subsequently incubated with anti-Runx2 antibody for 20 min. siRNA Transfection—Saos-2 cells were transfected with siRNAs at a concentration of 25 nm for 48 h using the previously described calcium phosphate precipitation method (45Chaplet M. Detry C. Deroanne C. Fisher L.W. Castronovo V. Bellahcene A. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). siRNAs specific to HDAC2 (5′-GCC UCA UAG AAU CCG CAU C), HDAC3 (5′-AAU CAG AAC UCA CGC CAG UAU), and Runx2 (5′-CUC UGC ACC AAG UCC UUU U (47Pratap J.

GL3 luciferase siRNA was used as an unrelated control (5′-CUU ACG CUG AGU ACU UCG A). All siRNAs and negative control siRNA (EGT) were purchased from Eurogentec. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from Saos-2 cells using RNeasy columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg of total RNA in 20 μl of RT reaction mixture containing 0.2 μg of pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences), 2 mm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (Eurogentec), 1× first strand buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 units of SuperScriptTM II RNase H RT (Invitrogen). The reverse transcriptase reaction was performed at 42 °C for 50 min before a 15-min inactivation step at 70 °C. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in triplicate using the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BSP primers and a TaqMan probe were designed using the primer design software Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) as previously described (45Chaplet M. Detry C. Deroanne C. Fisher L.W. Castronovo V. Bellahcene A. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); BSP forward (5′-TGCCTTGAGCCTGCTTCCT), BSP reverse (5′-CTGAGCAAAATTAAAGCAGTCTTCA), BSP probe (6-carboxyfluorescein-5′-CCAGGACTGCCAGAGGAAGCAATCA-3′-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine). The TaqMan glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) control reagent kit (Applied Biosystems) was used for GAPDH detection. cDNA samples (100 ng each) were mixed with 100 nm each of primer and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix containing 1× PCR buffer, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm dNTPs mix, 100 nm probe, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold® thermostable DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) in a total volume of 25 μl. Real-time PCR was conducted using the following parameters; 94 °C for 10 min, 45 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 57 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min after the last cycle. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed for BSP and normalized to the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA from the same sample. The acquired data were analyzed by Sequence Detector software, Version 1.9 (Applied Biosystems). BSP Expression Is Increased with Saos-2 Cell Confluence—The Saos-2 human cell line represents an interesting model for studying mechanisms that control osteoblast-specific gene expression. It has been previously suggested that the confluence status of Saos-2 cells may influence the expression of bone-related genes such as BSP (38McQuillan D.J. Richardson M.D. Bateman J.F. Bone (NY). 1995; 16: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Saos-2 cells were grown during increasing lengths of time corresponding to different confluence states: preconfluent (50%), confluent (100%), and postconfluent (confluent + 10 days and confluent + 20 days"
https://openalex.org/W1987639269,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is recognized as the major force for bacterial genome evolution. Yet, numerous questions remain about the transferred genes, their function, quantity and frequency. The extent to which genetic transformation by exogenous DNA has occurred over evolutionary time was initially addressed by an in silico approach using the complete genome sequence of the Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000 strain. Methods based on phylogenetic reconstruction of prokaryote homologous genes families detected 151 genes (13.3%) of foreign origin in the R. solanacearum genome and tentatively identified their bacterial origin. These putative transfers were analyzed in comparison to experimental transformation tests involving 18 different genomic DNA positions in the genome as sites for homologous or homeologous recombination. Significant transformation frequency differences were observed among these positions tested regardless of the overall genomic divergence of the R. solanacearum strains tested as recipients. The genomic positions containing the putative exogenous DNA were not systematically transformed at the highest frequencies. The two genomic “hot spots”, which contain recA and mutS genes, exhibited transformation frequencies from 2 to more than 4 orders of magnitude higher than positions associated with other genes depending on the recipient strain. These results support the notion that the bacterial cell is equipped with active mechanisms to modulate acquisition of new DNA in different genomic positions. Bio-informatics study correlated recombination “hot-spots” to the presence of Chi-like signature sequences with which recombination might be preferentially initiated. The fundamental role of HGT is certainly not limited to the critical impact that the very rare foreign genes acquired mainly by chance can have on the bacterial adaptation potential. The frequency to which HGT with homologous and homeologous DNA happens in the environment might have led the bacteria to hijack DNA repair mechanisms in order to generate genetic diversity without losing too much genomic stability."
https://openalex.org/W2016211979,"Fungal infections arise frequently in immunocompromised patients, and sterol synthesis is a primary pathway targeted by antifungal drugs. In particular, the P450 protein Erg11/Cyp51 catalyzes a critical step in ergosterol synthesis, and the azole class of antifungal drugs inhibits Erg11. Dap1 is a heme-binding protein related to cytochrome b5 that activates Erg11, so that cells lacking Dap1 accumulate the Erg11 substrate and are hypersensitive to Erg11 inhibitors. Heme binding by Dap1 is crucial for its function, and point mutants in its heme-binding domain render Dap1 inactive for sterol biosynthesis and DNA damage resistance. Like Dap1, the human homologue, PGRMC1/Hpr6, also regulates sterol synthesis and DNA damage resistance. In the present study, we demonstrate that the Dap1 heme-1 domain is required for growth under conditions of low iron availability. Loss of Dap1 is suppressed by elevated levels of Erg11 but not by increased heme biosynthesis. Dap1 localizes to punctate cytoplasmic structures that co-fractionate with endosomes, and Dap1 contributes to the integrity of the vacuole. The results suggest that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dap1 stimulates a P450-catalyzed step in sterol synthesis via a distinct localization from its homologues in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mammals and that this function regulates iron metabolism.

Fungal infections are important clinically because they contribute to the mortality of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS, cancer, and other diseases associated with immunosuppression. Mammalian hosts combat fungal infections via the immune system and by sequestering free iron in the bloodstream. Fungal infections can be suppressed with the azole group of antifungal drugs, a commercially important group of drugs that includes fluconazole, itraconazole, and miconazole. These drugs inhibit Erg11/Cyp51/lanosterol demethylase (1Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1471-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 2Lepesheva G.I. Waterman M.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), which catalyzes a critical step in the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane. Erg11 is one of a large class of monooxygenases that are called P450 proteins due to the spectral absorbance of a cysteine-linked heme molecule in their active site (3Hannemann F. Bichet A. Ewen K.M. Bernhardt R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 330-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Erg11 is activated by Dap1 (damage resistance protein 1) (4Hand R.A. Jia N. Bard M. Craven R.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which is related to cytochrome b5 (5Mifsud W. Bateman A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 1-5Crossref Google Scholar), a heme-binding protein that activates P450 reactions (3Hannemann F. Bichet A. Ewen K.M. Bernhardt R. Biochim. Biophys.

Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). According to microarray databases, DAP1 expression is induced by azole antifungal drugs (7Hughes T.R. Marton M.J.

Azole sensitivity in dap1Δ cells is suppressed by overexpressing Erg11 (8Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Johnson B.L. Mo C. Pierson C.A. Bard M. Craven R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and dap1Δ cells have ∼4-fold lower levels of Erg11 than wild-type cells (8Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Johnson B.L. Mo C. Pierson C.A. Bard M. Craven R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), although this regulation occurs primarily at the post-transcriptional level. Notably, the effect of Dap1 on sterol synthesis is conserved with its human homologue (9Hughes A.L. Powell D.W. Bard M. Eckstein J. Barbuch R. Link A.J. Espenshade P.J.

Ther. 2006; 316: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The heme-binding activity of Dap1 is critical for its function, and heme-binding defective mutants are inactive in sterol synthesis or damage resistance (8Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Johnson B.L. Mo C. Pierson C.A. Bard M. Craven R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the damage sensitivity and sterol synthesis phenotypes of dap1Δ mutants can be suppressed by adding exogenous heme (8Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Johnson B.L. Mo C. Pierson C.A. Bard M. Craven R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for Dap1 in maintaining heme metabolism. One appealing model for Dap1 family proteins is that they utilize their heme-binding activity to directly activate P450 proteins. However, unlike cytochromes and related proteins, Dap1 homologues lack the histidine residues that coordinate heme binding in cytochrome b5 (5Mifsud W. Bateman A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 1-5Crossref Google Scholar), suggesting that Dap1 may participate in intracellular heme trafficking. In addition to regulating ergosterol synthesis, Dap1 is required for resistance to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate, and dap1Δ cells have decreased mitochondrial function (4Hand R.A. Jia N. Bard M. Craven R.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Heme (iron protoporphyrin IX) is synthesized in an eight-step pathway that is subject to regulation at various steps (14Mense S.M. Zhang L. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Two key steps in heme synthesis are catalyzed by Hem1/5-aminolevulinate synthase, a mitochondrial protein, and Hem2/δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase/porphobilinogen synthase, which localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Heme and ergosterol share the same upstream precursors (15Weinstein J.D. Branchaud R. Beale S.I. Bement W.J. Sinclair P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 245: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the synthesis of heme and ergosterol are closely synchronized. The Hap1 transcription factor (16Guarente L. Lalonde B. Gifford P. Alani E. Cell. 1984; 36: 503-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) is directly regulated by heme through a series of heme-regulated sequence motifs that control multiprotein complex formation and DNA binding (17Zhang L. Hach A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Heme is also required for the transcription of iron transport and sterol synthetic genes (18Crisp R.J. Pollington A. Galea C. Jaron S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45499-45506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Iron levels, in turn, regulate the transcription, post-transcriptional stability, and post-translational levels of numerous genes and gene products (19Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 20Shakoury-Elizeh M. Tiedeman J. Rashford J. Ferea T. Demeter J. Garcia E. Rolfes R. Brown P.O. Botstein D.

Chem. 2005; 280: 22181-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One of the iron-regulated transcripts is DAP1, which is post-transcriptionally regulated by proteins that respond to low iron conditions (19Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Because of the close relationship between iron metabolism and the synthesis of heme and ergosterol, we have examined the role of Dap1 in these processes. We have found that Dap1 regulates growth under low iron conditions through a mechanism that requires its heme-1 domain, and Dap1-mediated growth on low iron is mediated by Erg11. We have also shown that Dap1 localizes to endosomes and regulates the structure of the vacuole, which is characteristic of other sterol biosynthetic proteins. The results represent a novel function for the Dap1 family proteins, which include homologues in mammals that are important for sterol synthesis and in cancer. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—All strains were isogenic with W303 (leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ura3-1 ade2-1 trp1-1 can1-100 rad5-535) (22Thomas B.J. Rothstein R.

The rad5-535 allele was replaced with the wild-type RAD5 gene by crossing and tested by PCR as described (23Craven R.J. Petes T.D. Genetics. 2001; 158: 145-154PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained yeast-peptone-dextrose (YPD) 2The abbreviations used are:YPDyeast-peptone-dextroseHAhemagglutininMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidBPSbathophenanthroline disulfonic acidMMSmethyl methanesulfonate. or synthetic dextrose plates. Methyl methanesulfonate (Sigma) and bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid (Fisher) were added to plates at the indicated doses.

The pSCCC1 plasmid has also been described previously (24Chen O.S. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The dap1Δ::HIS3 strain RCY456 was constructed by one-step transplacement of the entire DAP1 gene with a PCR product containing HIS3 and DAP1-flanking homology. Oligonucleotide sequences are available as supplemental Fig. 1. For Dap1 expression studies, the DAP1 open reading frame was fused in frame with three copies of the HA epitope tag sequence by one-step integration of the epitope tag fused to the KanMX reporter gene. The HA tag sequence was amplified by PCR with the primers DAP1-TAGF and DAP1-TAGR, using the plasmid pFA6a-3HA-KanMX6 (25Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar) as a template. W303a cells were transformed with the resulting PCR product, and Geneticin-resistant isolates were tested for insertion of the epitope tag by PCR. The resulting strain, RCY172, was crossed to the strain RCY308-7b (α mec1-21 CAN1 RAD5) (26Craven R.J. Greenwell P.W. Dominska M. Petes T.D.

The two former strains were mated to produce the wild-type diploid RCY410, and the two latter strains produced the DAP1-HA diploid RCY411, which were used for immunofluorescence. For Erg11-Myc staining, RCY411 was transformed with pRH7 (8Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Johnson B.L. Mo C. Pierson C.A. Bard M. Craven R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which encodes Erg11 fused to a single Myc epitope tag. All genetic manipulations were performed using standard conditions. Plasmids—The plasmid pJM63, encoding HEM1, was prepared by amplifying the entire HEM1 gene using the primers HEM1-300F-Bam and HEM1+1722R-Eco and subcloning the product into the plasmid YEplac195. Similarly, HEM2 was amplified with the primers HEM2-300F-Hind and HEM2+1028R-Eco and subcloned into YEplac195, forming the plasmid pJM64. For NSG1 overexpression, the entire NSG1 gene was amplified using the primers NSG1-300F and NSG1+873R-Myc and was initially subcloned into the PCR cloning plasmid pCR2.1, forming the plasmid pJM76. The NSG1 fragment was the liberated as a XhoI-BamHI fragment and subcloned into the SalI and BamHI sites of YEplac195, forming the plasmid pJM77. FET3 Promoter Assays—The FET3-lacZ plasmid, consisting of the FET3 promoter fused to lacZ in the plasmid YEp354, was the kind gift of Dr. Jerry Kaplan and has been described previously (27Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For lacZ measurement, cells were grown in synthetic medium, with or without 100 μm bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid (BPS) for 3 h. The A600 was measured, and the cells were centrifuged and lysed with 250 μl of the Y-PER solution (Pierce), and the lysate was incubated with 700 μl of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4-7H2O, 40 mm NaH2PO4-H2O, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside. The reaction was stopped with 500 μl of 1 m Na2CO3, clarified by centrifugation, and measured at 420 nm, using the same concentrations of Y-PER, Z buffer, and Na2CO3 as a blank. Miller units ((A420 × 1000)/(A600/min/ml)) were calculated for each point. FET3 transcription was assayed independently by reverse transcription-PCR as described previously (8Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Johnson B.L. Mo C. Pierson C.A. Bard M. Craven R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with the FET3 primers FET3+100F (ACAGGAACGTTGATGGGCTA) and FET3+380R (GAATGGTACCAGTAGGTGCC). Primers for the SCS2 transcript (8Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Johnson B.L. Mo C. Pierson C.A. Bard M. Craven R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) served as a control for loading and were included in the same reaction as for FET3, and the products were separated in 2% agarose. Assays for ferric reductase activity were performed as described previously (28Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Protein Analysis—Log phase yeast cultures were lysed in Y-PER lysis solution (Pierce) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and analyzed essentially as described (8Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Johnson B.L. Mo C. Pierson C.A. Bard M. Craven R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The antibody to HA (HA11) was from BabCo, and the antibody to α-tubulin was developed by J. Frankel and was obtained from the Developmental Studies Bank at the University of Iowa under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health. For cell fractionation, cell fractions were separated by sucrose gradient essentially as described (29Kagiwada S. Hosaka K. Murata M. Nikawa J. Takatsuki A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 ml of log phase cells were arrested with the addition of 10 mm sodium azide, chilled on ice water, and then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in spheroplasting buffer (1 m sorbitol, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.3 mg/ml zymolase) and incubated at 30 °C for 40 min. Spheroplasts were then centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EGTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were then lysed with three 10-s pulses from a Polytron PT1200 homogenizer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min to remove unlysed cells. One ml of the lysate was separated on a discontinuous 12-60% sucrose gradient by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 16 h. at 4 °C. Fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies to the peroxisome marker Ypt7 (a kind gift from Dr. William Wickner), the mitochondrial marker Por1 (Molecular Probes), the lipid particle marker Erg6 (a kind gift from Dr. Gunther Daum), the endosomal marker Pep12 (Molecular Probes), the plasma membrane ATPase Pma1 (a kind gift from Dr. Ramon Serrano), and Erg11 (8Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Johnson B.L. Mo C. Pierson C.A. Bard M. Craven R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fluorescence—Staining was performed largely as described (29Kagiwada S. Hosaka K. Murata M. Nikawa J. Takatsuki A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Log phase diploid cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 30 min, centrifuged, resuspended in 1 m sorbitol containing 3.7% formaldehyde, and rotated at 4 °C overnight. Cells were spheroplasted in 1 m sorbitol containing 10 μg/ml zymolase and 70 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 30 °C for 1 h, washed once in PBS, and applied to a poly-l-lysine-coated slide. Cells were then permeabilized with ice-cold methanol, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and stained with the HA11 monoclonal antibody (BabCo) for Dap1-HA and an anti-Myc tag antibody (Genscript) for Erg11-Myc, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. For FM4-64 staining, cells were incubated with 20 μm FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) in YPD medium for 10 min, washed, and incubated for an additional 10 min in YPD before microscopic analysis. In all cases, cells were examined using a Zeiss microscope, and images were captured using Axioskop software. Sterol Analysis—200 ml of early log phase cells were grown in YPD medium and treated with 100 μm BPS for 3 h. Cells were pelleted and washed once with distilled water and extracted with potassium hydroxide-ethanol. Sterols were subsequently extracted with hexane, as described previously (4Hand R.A. Jia N. Bard M. Craven R.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Johnson B.L. Mo C. Pierson C.A. Bard M. Craven R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and analyzed by gas chromatography at the University of Kentucky Mass Spectrometry Facility. Strains Lacking Dap1 Are Sensitive to Iron Depletion—Wild-type and dap1Δ strains were maintained on iron-depleted medium by culturing in 100 μm BPS. Wild-type cells grew normally, whereas the dap1Δ strains did not (Fig. 1A, columns 3 and 4). A small zone of residual growth in the dap1Δ strain was dark red and consisted of nonbudded cells with a disrupted morphology. The BPS sensitivity of dap1Δ cells was complemented by the wild-type DAP1 gene (Fig. 1B, row 7) but not by the DAP1-D91G mutant (Fig. 1B, row 8), which does not bind to heme (8Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Johnson B.L. Mo C. Pierson C.A. Bard M. Craven R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The results suggest that the heme binding function of Dap1 is required for growth under iron-depleted conditions. The expression of the multicopper oxidase Fet3 is induced under iron-depleted conditions (30Van Ho A. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A construct containing the FET3 promoter fused to the bacterial lacZ gene was used to measure FET3 expression. FET3 increased 22-fold in wild-type cells and 31-fold in dap1Δ cells following iron depletion (Fig. 1C), a difference that was statistically significant (p = 5 × 10-6, two-tailed t test). The difference in FET3 transcription in BPS-treated wild-type and dap1Δ cells was confirmed using using reverse transcription-PCR, where we reproducibly detected a 25% increase in FET3 levels (Fig. 1D). Despite increased FET3 transcription, we did not detect any change in the uptake of radiolabeled iron or iron reductase activity (50.5 ± 2.8 nmol of Fe2+/min/A600 for wild type versus 52.6 ± 5.0 for dap1Δ). The results suggest a disparity between iron-regulated transcription and iron uptake in dap1Δ cells. Because Dap1 regulates sterol synthesis, we tested the effect of the Dap1 mutation on sterol biosynthesis under low iron conditions. As expected, dap1Δ cells had elevated lanosterol and episterol relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 2, compare A and C). Treatment of wild-type cells with BPS caused a modest accumulation of episterol (Fig. 2B), whereas dap1Δ cells accumulated increased levels of squalene (Fig. 2D), suggesting an iron-related defect in Erg1 function in dap1Δ cells. The sterol synthetic pathway is diagrammed in Fig. 2E. Although the Erg1 substrate was elevated under iron-depleted conditions, multicopy expression of Erg1 did not suppress BPS sensitivity in dap1Δ cells (Fig. 2F, bottom, compare bottom rows), indicating that altered Erg1 function is not directly related to iron metabolic defects in dap1Δ cells. Erg11 Suppresses the Requirement for Dap1 in Iron Metabolism—Because Dap1 requires heme binding for sterol synthesis, damage resistance, and viability in low iron, we developed a genetic system for increasing heme levels. The HEM1/δ-aminolevulinate synthase and HEM2/δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase genes were expressed at high copy numbers using the multiple copy plasmid YEplac195, and this suppressed the elevated susceptibility of dap1Δ cells to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (Fig. 3A). The effect was more pronounced for HEM2 than HEM1 (Fig. 3A, rows 11 and 12). However, HEM1 and HEM2 high copy expression did not suppress itraconazole sensitivity, suggesting that the expression of these genes is not limiting for sterol synthesis (Fig. 3A, rows 17 and 18). Nsg1 is the yeast homologue of the human Insig-1 protein, which binds to the human Dap1 homologue (31Suchanek M. Radzikowska A. Thiele C. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). However, a high dosage of NSG1 did not suppress MMS, itraconazole, or BPS susceptibility in dap1Δ cells (data not shown). Although the heme-binding domain of Dap1 was required for MMS resistance, high dose expression of HEM2 did not suppress BPS sensitivity in dap1Δ cells (Fig. 3B, row 11). In contrast, high dosage of ERG11 completely suppressed BPS sensitivity (Fig. 3B, row 12). This effect was not generalized to other sterol biosynthetic genes, because high dosage of ERG1 and ERG5 had no effect on BPS sensitivity in dap1Δ strains (data not shown). Dap1 binds to heme and is related to cytochrome b5, encoded by CYB5 in S. cerevisiae, but high copy expression of CYB5 did not suppress loss of Dap1 (data not shown). Because ERG11 suppressed loss of DAP1, we tested the extent to which Erg11 inhibitors affected growth on iron-depleted medium. We detected partial growth of wild-type cells on 2 μm itraconazole and 100 μm BPS (Fig. 3C, rows 2 and 3, respectively) but essentially no growth when the two compounds were combined (Fig. 3C, row 4). Taken together, the results suggest that sterol synthesis mediated by Erg11 and Dap1 is required for survival in iron-depleted medium, and this Dap1 function is not a general property of cytochrome-like proteins. Characterization of Dap1—We fused three copies of the HA epitope tag sequence through one-step integration to the 3′ end of the DAP1 gene. As a result, DAP1 was transcribed from its own promoter and synthesized from a single copy of its gene. The tagged Dap1 protein was readily detected as a 25-kDa protein by Western blot (Fig. 4A, top, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, strains lacking the in frame epitope tag did not have a detectable 27-kDa protein (Fig. 4A, top, lane 1). Thus, the migration of Dap1 was similar to that of related rat and human proteins. In all cases, blots were probed with an antibody to tubulin as a control for protein loading (Fig. 4A, bottom). Dap1 expression was reported previously to change upon treatment with the antifungal triazole drug itraconazole (7Hughes T.R. Marton M.J. Jones A.R. Roberts C.J. Stoughton R. Armour C.D. Bennett H.A. Coffey E. Dai H. He Y.D. Kidd M.J. King A.M. Meyer M.R. Slade D. Lum P.Y. Stepaniants S.B. Shoemaker D.D. Gachotte D. Chakraburtty K. Simon J. Bard M. Friend S.H.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The expression of Dap1 increased 14-fold in cells treated with 0.1-1 μm itraconazole in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). In contrast, Dap1 expression did not change significantly following treatment with MMS, heat shock, or hydroxyurea (supplemental Fig. 2A). In addition, we did not detect any changes in Dap1 expression following treatment with BPS (supplemental Fig. 2B) or in strains with elongated or shortened telomeres (tel1Δ or rif1Δ rif2Δ, respectively; supplemental Fig. 2C) or in strains with acute damage sensitivity (mec1-21, rad9Δ, or dun1Δ). Dap1 Localizes to Punctate Cytoplasmic Sites and Co-fractionates with Endosomal Markers—A diploid strain expressing the tagged Dap1 protein (Fig. 4A, lane 4), which was not expressed in the control untagged diploid strain (Fig. 4A, top, lane 5) was stained by immunofluorescence with the HA antibody. Dap1 localized to bright, clearly defined spots within the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C; bright field in Fig. 4D). The spots varied in size and number between the cells and were detectable in both mother and daughter cells. There was no evidence for Dap1 staining within the mother-bud neck, within the nucleus, or at the cell periphery. In contrast, the control diploid strain did not stain with the HA antibody after the same procedure (Fig. 4E; bright field shown in Fig. 4F). Similar spots of Dap1 staining were detected in haploid strains but were more difficult to visualize due to the smaller cell size. Punctate cytoplasmic staining is characteristic of several types of subcellular structures. Thus, the subcellular fractions of a Dap1-tagged strain were separated on a sucrose gradient and probed for Dap1 or various markers. Dap1 co-fractionated with Ypt7 (Fig. 5, A and B), a GTP-binding protein that regulates vacuolar transport (32Wichmann H. Hengst L. Gallwitz D. Cell. 1992; 71: 1131-1142Abstract Full Te"
https://openalex.org/W2000990910,"The dysconnection hypothesis has been proposed to account for pathophysiological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia. Widespread structural changes suggesting abnormal connectivity in schizophrenia have been imaged. A functional counterpart of the structural maps would be the EEG synchronization maps. However, due to the limits of currently used bivariate methods, functional correlates of dysconnection are limited to the isolated measurements of synchronization between preselected pairs of EEG signals.To reveal a whole-head synchronization topography in schizophrenia, we applied a new method of multivariate synchronization analysis called S-estimator to the resting dense-array (128 channels) EEG obtained from 14 patients and 14 controls. This method determines synchronization from the embedding dimension in a state-space domain based on the theoretical consequence of the cooperative behavior of simultaneous time series-the shrinking of the state-space embedding dimension. The S-estimator imaging revealed a specific synchronization landscape in schizophrenia patients. Its main features included bilaterally increased synchronization over temporal brain regions and decreased synchronization over the postcentral/parietal region neighboring the midline. The synchronization topography was stable over the course of several months and correlated with the severity of schizophrenia symptoms. In particular, direct correlations linked positive, negative, and general psychopathological symptoms to the hyper-synchronized temporal clusters over both hemispheres. Along with these correlations, general psychopathological symptoms inversely correlated within the hypo-synchronized postcentral midline region. While being similar to the structural maps of cortical changes in schizophrenia, the S-maps go beyond the topography limits, demonstrating a novel aspect of the abnormalities of functional cooperation: namely, regionally reduced or enhanced connectivity.The new method of multivariate synchronization significantly boosts the potential of EEG as an imaging technique compatible with other imaging modalities. Its application to schizophrenia research shows that schizophrenia can be explained within the concept of neural dysconnection across and within large-scale brain networks."

Specific sets of SNAREs located on vesicle and target membranes form a complex that draws together SNARE transmembrane domains, leading to juxtaposition and fusion of the two lipid membranes.

Neuronal SNAREs play a key role in the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, a process that is critical for neurotransmission (5Gerber S.H. Sudhof T.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S3-S11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synaptic vesicles dock at the plasma membrane and upon cell depolarization and Ca2+ entry fuse with the plasma membrane, thus releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neuronal SNARE complex is composed of synaptobrevin 2, which is primarily localized to synaptic vesicles, and syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25, which are primarily associated with the plasma membrane. The family of yeast SNAREs mediates constitutive fusion between transport vesicles and intracellular organelles or the plasma membrane (6Mayer A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 289-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Yeast has been a valuable system for studying membrane fusion and vesicular transport because of the ease of genetic and biochemical manipulations. Yeast is also one of the first organisms that evolved to utilize intracellular membrane fusion and therefore provides a valuable snapshot of the fusion machinery in lower eukaryotes. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNARE proteins involved in exocytosis at the plasma membrane (the synaptobrevin homologue Snc1p, the syntaxin homologue Sso1p, and the SNAP-25 homologue Sec9p) show assembly properties similar to their neuronal and endosomal homologues. Relative to the neuronal SNARE complex the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex exhibits decreased thermal stability, and prior to SNARE complex formation, Sso1p interacts with Sec9p with 1:1 stoichiometry (as opposed to a mixture of 1:1 and 1:2 for the neuronal SNAREs) (8Fasshauer D.

To dissect the differences between S. cerevisiae, neuronal, and endosomal SNARE complexes we determined the structure of the S. cerevisiae plasma membrane SNARE complex consisting of the cytoplasmic SNARE core domains at 1.7 Å resolution. Surprisingly, we found a larger number of buried water molecules compared with the neuronal SNARE complex. We then performed mutagenesis experiments to determine the influence of these water molecules on the stability of the complex. Protein Expression and Purification—The SNARE core domains of Snc1p (residues 28-92), Sso1p (residues 189-257), Sec9p (residues 429-500), and Sec9p (residues 589-651) were cloned into the pet28b vector (Novagen) with an N-terminal His6 tag. All proteins were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21DE3 cells and grown at 37 °C until an optical density (measured at 600 nm) of 1.0 was reached. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyrano-side at 37 °C for 1-3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For purification, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 6 m GdHCl) and lysed by sonication. Lysate was incubated in the lysis buffer for 1 h and then cleared by ultracentrifugation before incubation with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin for 4 h. The resin was washed with 250 ml of lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 200 mm GdHCl. Ssop1 protein was prone to aggregation and thus the buffer was supplemented with 1.5 m urea. His6 tags were removed by thrombin cleavage at room temperature for 2 h, and cleavage was verified by mass spectrometry. Complex Formation—The ternary complex was assembled by mixing Snc1p, Ssop1, Sec9p (residues 429-500), and Sec9p (residues 589-651) at a 1:1:1:1 molar ratio in 6 m GdHCl, followed by overnight dialysis into 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl. After dialysis, the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex was diluted to 75 mm NaCl and purified by MonoQ ion exchange chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex75 16/60 column in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Refinement—S. cerevisiae SNARE complex crystals were grown by the hanging drop method at 25 °C using a precipitant solution containing 100 mm MES, pH 6.25, 30% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 200 mm sodium bromide. Square-shaped crystals appeared in a few days and grew to ∼200 × 200 × 200 μm. Crystals were directly flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beamline 11-1. The crystals belong to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 76.9 Å, b = 48.11 Å, c = 110.3 Å, and β = 97.7° and diffracted to 1.7 Å resolution (Table 1).

A total of 99.8% of the residues in S. cerevisiae SNARE complex are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, and 0.2% in the additional allowed regions as calculated with PROCHECK (19Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4404) Google Scholar). The final model contains 6656 atoms (6064 protein and 592 waters). The coordinates for the structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Mutagenesis—The removal of the first cavity was accomplished by a single mutation in Sec9p (T615M). The cavity 2 mutant consists of two mutations, T39V in Snc1p and S605I in Sec9p. The cavity 3 mutant has a single mutation in Sec9p (N486M). The removal of all three cavities was achieved by four combined mutations (T39V in Snc1p, and N486M, S605I, and T615M in Sec9p). CD Analysis—CD data were collected on an Aviv 202-01 spectrometer equipped with a thermoelectric unit using a 1-mm-path length cell. Protein samples were 50 μm in buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 150 mm KCl. Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectrophotometry at 280 nm and BCA assay (Pierce). Thermal melts were monitored at 222 nm. Data were collected every 2 °C with an equilibration time of 2 min and an averaging time of 15 s. All temperature melts were performed at least four times and averaged. Although the level of sequence identity between neuronal and S. cerevisiae SNAREs is not exceptionally high (Snc1p and synaptobrevin 2 (36%), Sso1p and syntaxin 1A (50%), and Sec9p and SNAP-25A (32%)), the overall structure of the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex is very similar to that of neuronal and endosomal SNARE complexes (Fig. 1). All structures consist of a four-helix bundle with all four helices arranged in parallel, i.e. their N and C termini are aligned and there is an ionic layer composed of one arginine and three glutamine residues at the center of the complex. Interestingly, the structures of SNARE complexes that are involved in plasma membrane fusion (the neuronal and S. cerevisiae SNARE complexes) are more similar to one another than they are to the endosomal SNARE complexes; the root mean square deviations between S. cerevisiae, and neuronal, early endosomal, and late endosomal structures are 0.9, 2.3, and 1.4 Å, respectively. A striking difference between the neuronal and S. cerevisiae SNARE complexes is a more pronounced helical bend near the ionic layer (Fig. 2A). This increased bend is likely caused by the glycine to glutamine (Gln-225) substitution in Sso1p. The larger side chain in the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex would clash with Gln-468 (one of the three ionic layer glutamines) if it had the conformation of the neuronal complex. Therefore, the backbone of Sso1p near residue 225 is pushed 1.0-1.7 Å away from the ionic layer (Fig. 2B; note the hydrogen bonding network involving Gln-225 in Fig. 2C), causing the more pronounced bending of the Sso1p helix. The degree of bending varies between the three independent S. cerevisiae SNARE complexes in the asymmetric unit, suggesting that this region of the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex is flexible in solution. To investigate the contribution of the Sso1p bending to the stability of the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex, we created a Q225G mutant of Sso1p. The Q225G mutant should allow the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex to form a complex with a less pronounced bend at the ionic layer. However, the mutation decreased the thermal stability of the complex by 2 °C (not shown), suggesting that the increased bending angle of Sso1p is not destabilizing. Interestingly, residue Gly-227 in syntaxin 1A (equivalent to Gln-225 in S. cerevisiae Sso1p), which does not induce bending of the neuronal SNARE complex, is almost entirely conserved among syntaxins involved in plasma membrane fusion and in endosome/lysosome fusion (Syntaxins 1A, 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, and 16). It is, however, variable in Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and yeast syntaxins, where its identity varies. It is difficult to directly compare the differences in bending between S. cerevisiae and endosomal SNARE complexes due to increasing differences in helix position, especially toward the SNARE complex termini. The endosomal SNARE complexes, like the neuronal SNARE complex, have a glycine at residue 227 (residue 225 in neuronal syntaxin 1A). Inspection of the structures suggests that the degree to which the syntaxin helix is pushed out is governed by the size of side chains in the +1 layer. Apart from the increased bending of the Sso1p helix at the ionic layer, the ionic layer of S. cerevisiae SNAREs is very similar to that of the neuronal SNARE complex (Fig. 3, A and B), where Arg-53 forms a hydrogen bond network with Gln-224, Gln-468, and Gln-622 of Sso1p and Sec9p (Fig. 3A). The side chain of Arg-53 adopts two different rotamers in the three independent S. cerevisiae SNARE complexes in the asymmetric unit. Alternative rotamers of the equivalent arginine residue in the ionic layer have also been observed in neuronal SNAREs (10Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8630-8636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One remarkable property of the neuronal SNARE complex is its high stability: The neuronal SNARE complex undergoes cooperative unfolding with a melting temperature of ∼90 °C (Fig. 4) and resists SDS denaturation up to 60 °C (10Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8630-8636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae SNARE complex is less stable and melts at Tm = 55 °C (Fig. 4), nearly 35 °C lower than its neuronal homologue. In addition to its lower Tm, the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex is not SDS-resistant. The early and late endosomal SNARE complexes have melting temperatures of 87 (12Zwilling D. Cypionka A. Pohl W.H. Fasshauer D. Walla P.J. Wahl M.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and 78 °C, respectively (20Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The melting temperature of the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex increases with the length of the constructs from 55 to 64 °C when an additional eight residues are included at the N terminus of the complex (data not shown). Similar behavior was observed for the neuronal complex, where the Tm increases from 90 to 95 °C (10Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8630-8636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The longer, more thermally stable S. cerevisiae SNARE complex, however, diffracted only to ∼3.5 Å resolution and was not pursued further. Similarly, the longer neuronal SNARE complex was solved at 2.4 Å resolution (11Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar), whereas the shorter complex diffracted to 1.45 Å (10Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8630-8636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The effect of SNARE complex length is further exemplified by our previous report (9Rice L.M. Brennwald P. Brunger A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The melting temperature of the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex consisting of Sso1p N-terminal domain (residues 1-265), Snc1p (residues 1-93), and Sec9p (residues 401-651) is 71 °C (9Rice L.M. Brennwald P. Brunger A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex described here (Snc1p (residues 28-92), Sso1p (residues 189-257), Sec9p (residues 429-500), and Sec9p (residues 589-651)) has a reduced melting temperature of 55 °C. Therefore, the N terminus of Sso1p, length of the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex, or the linker between the two Sec9p helices can have a large effect on complex thermal stability. For these reasons, the comparison of the S. cerevisiae and neuronal SNARE complexes was carried out with the shorter neuronal SNARE complex that has nearly identical length (except for the SN1 fragment, which has eleven more residues at the N terminus). The early endosomal complex is also of similar length to the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex, whereas the late endosomal complex is shorter at both N and C termini. The core of the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex contains several unusual layers that may contribute to its lower stability. For example, the neuronal SNARE complex has a methionine in the -2 layer (Met-167 in SNAP-25), whereas the S. cerevisiae Sec9p has a threonine (Fig. 3, C and D). The smaller side chain of Thr-615 allows water to penetrate the center of the SNARE complex, creating an internal water-filled cavity. Indeed, three ordered water molecules are present in this layer (Fig. 3C). These water molecules form hydrogen bonds to each other and to Thr-461 and Thr-615 of Sec9p. A second water-filled cavity is formed between the -4 and -5 layers in the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex (Fig. 3, E and F). The presence of a water molecule at this position is made possible by a hydrophobic to hydrophilic change of two residues compared to the neuronal SNARE complex: Val-36 in synaptobrevin 2 and Ile-157 in SNAP-25A versus Thr-39 in Snc1p and Ser-605 in Sec9p (Fig. 3F). The water molecule is held in place by forming hydrogen bonds to both Thr-39 in Snc1p and Ser-605 in Sec9p (Fig. 3E). A third cavity is present between the +5 and +6 layers. The cavity is created by a change of methionine in SNAP-25 (Met-71) to an asparagine residue (Asn-486) in the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex. The water molecule in this cavity is not present in all three complexes in the asymmetric unit and most likely is only partially occupied. In addition, two distinct conformations of Asn-486 can be seen in one of the three complexes, suggesting loose packing and conformational variability in the +5 and +6 layers. Comparison of all SNARE complex structures determined at high resolution (2 Å or higher) showed that the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex has the most water-filled cavities. To estimate the destabilizing effect of water-filled cavities in the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex, we mutated residues in these layers to match those found in the neuronal complex, which contain no water-filled cavities. Separate removal of cavities 1 and 3 stabilizes the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex by 1.9 and 3.8 °C, respectively, whereas removal of cavity 2 destabilizes the SNARE complex by 2 °C. The combined removal of all three cavities stabilizes the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex by 6.7 °C (Fig. 4). The electrostatic potentials of all SNARE complexes solved to date are very negative in the center region (11Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). The overall charge of the neuronal SNARE complex (PDB code 1N7S) is -19, whereas the overall charge of the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex presented here is -11. The early and late endosomal SNARE complexes (PDB codes 2NPS and 1GL2) have overall charges of -9 and -18, respectively. The negative electrostatic potential of the center region of the neuronal SNARE complex is thought to be important for interaction with the Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin I (21Rizo J. Chen X. Arac D. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin I has a positively charged surface, especially in the presence of Ca2+ (22Shao X. Li C. Fernandez I. Zhang X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The interaction between synaptotagmin I and SNARE complex can be disrupted by increasing the salt concentrations above physiological levels (4Tang J. Maximov A. Shin O.H. Dai H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2006; 126: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), further supporting the importance of electrostatic interactions in the formation of the SNARE-synaptotagmin complex. It is unknown whether the negative surfaces present in the S. cerevisiae and endosomal SNARE complexes are structural features of SNARE proteins or if they are also involved in protein-protein interactions with other regulatory partners such as calmodulin (23Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The +7 layer of the SNARE complex has been proposed to be one of the key differences between SNARE complexes that fuse constitutively and those that undergo triggered fusion (24Lagow R.D. Bao H. Cohen E.N. Daniels R.W. Zuzek A. Williams W.H. Macleod G.T. Sutton R.B. Zhang B. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e72Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For Drosophila SNAREs, the T254I mutation enhances both constitutive and evoked neurotransmitter release, suggesting that the tighter packing of isoleucine promotes SNARE formation and fusion, whereas the presence of threonine prevents good packing (Fig. 6B) and halts full SNARE complex formation. However, the plasma membrane yeast SNARE Sso1p contradicts this simple rule because it is involved in constitutive fusion and yet it has a threonine in the equivalent position (Thr-249). The structure of the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex shows that the +7 layer is well packed despite the presence of threonine (Fig. 6A): The Sec9p valine (Val-493) and leucine (Leu-647), Snc1p Ala-78, and Sso1p Thr249 form a well-packed layer (Fig. 6C). Thus, rather than a particular residue, it is the combination of residues that determines the packing in the +7 layer and perhaps contributes to the difference between constitutive and triggered fusion. SNARE proteins play an important role in vesicle trafficking, which is a fundamental process in all eukaryotic cells for the transfer of proteins, lipids, and metabolites between compartments. Because of the importance of these processes, the SNARE complex has remained conserved throughout evolution. Here we have shown that the S. cerevisiae SNARE complex is structurally similar to SNARE complexes from higher eukaryotes but exhibits more pronounced bending near the ionic layer and contains water-filled cavities. These cavities are in part contributing to the decreased stability of the S. cerevisiae plasma membrane SNARE complex. We thank Tim D. Fenn for helpful discussions and reading of the manuscript.

Both intermediates are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum by promiscuous and HLA-dedicated chaperones and are poorly associated with peptide antigens. In this study, the eight serologically defined HLA-C alleles and the interlocus recombinant HLA-B46 allele (sharing the HLA-C-specific motif KYRV at residues 66–76 of the α1-domain α-helix) were compared with a large series of HLA-B and HLA-A alleles. Pulse-labeling experiments with HLA-C transfectants and HLA homozygous cell lines demonstrated that KYRV alleles accumulate as free heavy chains because of both poor assembly and post-assembly instability. Reactivity with antibodies to mapped linear epitopes, co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and molecular dynamics simulation studies additionally showed that the KYRV motif confers association to the HLA-dedicated chaperones TAP and tapasin as well as reduced plasticity and unfolding in the peptide-binding groove. Finally, in vitro assembly experiments in cell extracts of the T2 and 721.220 mutant cell lines demonstrated that HLA-Cw1 retains the ability to form a peptide-receptive interface despite a lack of TAP and functional tapasin, respectively. In the context of the available literature, these results indicate that a single locus-specific biosynthetic bottleneck renders HLA-C peptide-selective (rather than peptide-unreceptive) and a preferential natural killer cell ligand.

Class I human leukocyte antigens (called HLA) are cell-surface heterotrimers formed by a highly polymorphic heavy (44 kDa) chain, a non-polymorphic light (12 kDa) chain subunit (β2 -microglobulin (β2m) 3The abbreviations used are: β2mβ2-microglobulinNKnatural killerCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidIEFisoelectric focusing. 3The abbreviations used are: β2mβ2-microglobulinNKnatural killerCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidIEFisoelectric focusing.), and a short (8–11-mer) peptide antigen derived from the degradation of intracellular proteins (1Groothuis T.A. Griekspoor A.C. Neijssen J.J. Herberts C.A. Neefjes J.J. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 60-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The assembly pathway of most class I molecules involves an early interaction of the heavy chain, still free of β2m, with calnexin, followed by association with β2m and binding to the so-called peptide-loading complex. This is a supramolecular endoplasmic reticulum structure comprising, among others, two HLA-dedicated chaperones: TAP transporter associated with antigen processing) and the peptide editor/facilitator tapasin (1Groothuis T.A. Griekspoor A.C. Neijssen J.J. Herberts C.A. Neefjes J.J. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 60-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Successful peptide loading results in tight association of the heavy chain with β2m and the release of thermally stable, folded class I conformers (1Groothuis T.A. Griekspoor A.C. Neijssen J.J.

These are exported to the cell surface, where they activate and inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocytes expressing the rearranging T cell receptor and natural killer (NK) cells expressing non-rearranging receptors such as the killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, respectively (4Colonna M.

There are >1000 class I molecules, encoded by three highly polymorphic allelic series: HLA-A, -B, and -C (www.anthonynolan.org.UK/HIG/index.html). They share a conserved general architecture, a common peptide-loading pathway, and a similar set of functions, but also display a number of allele- and locus-specific sequences responsible for distinctive structural properties and specialized functional features (reviewed in Ref. 1Groothuis T.A. Griekspoor A.C. Neijssen J.J. Herberts C.A. Neefjes J.J. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 60-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the case of HLA-C, there are three known locus-specific motifs, one of which (particularly extensive) involves heavy chain residues 66, 67, 69, and 76 (KYRV) in the α1-domain α-helix (5Zemmour J. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Next to the KYRV 66–76 motif, a functional dimorphism involving residues 77 and 80 regulates NK cell recognition by the KIR2DL1/KIR2DL2 inhibitory receptors (4Colonna M. Moretta A. Vély F. Vivier E. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 428-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because crystallographic data show that T cell receptor and killer immunoglobulin-like receptor footprints on HLA-C are largely overlapping and that both encompass the HLA-C-specific motif (6Boyington J.C. Motyka S.A. Schuck P. Brooks A.G. Sun P.D. Nature. 2000; 405: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), it appears that a stretch of polymorphic residues on the α1-domain α-helix encodes a unique recognition structure promiscuously recognized by HLA-C-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells. Relevant to this tight packaging of distinct structural determinants within a narrow region, it appears that HLA-C, although an extremely good ligand for NK cells, is a much poorer antigen-presenting class I molecule than HLA-A and HLA-B (reviewed in Refs. 1Groothuis T.A. Griekspoor A.C. Neijssen J.J. Herberts C.A. Neefjes J.J. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 60-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Zemmour J. Parham P. J. Exp.

Also in contrast to HLA-A and HLA-B, HLA-C is a rather poor assembler. This latter feature has been proposed to correlate with impaired intracellular transport and low surface expression (8Neefjes J.J. Ploegh H.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Neisig A. Melief C.J.M. Neefjes J.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 171-179PubMed Google Scholar), although this conclusion has been questioned (10McCutcheon J.A. Gumperz J. Smith K.D. Lutz C.T. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2085-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Poor assembly of HLA-C is strongly supported by the intracellular accumulation of two broad classes of folding intermediates: β2m-free and β2m-associated class I heavy chains. HLA-C heavy chains free of β2m (free heavy chains) were the first folding intermediates to be identified and extensively characterized (8Neefjes J.J. Ploegh H.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) based on their reactivity with antibodies that bind linear epitopes accessible on unfolded but hidden in β2m-associated heavy chains. More recently, taking advantage of two such antibodies (HC10 and L31) to mapped, nearly contiguous linear epitopes spanning the entire N-terminal region of the α1-domain α-helix (L31 binds an epitope centered on an aromatic amino acid at position 67), we have provided evidence that free HLA-C heavy chains bear an extensive local un/mis-folding involving the HLA-C-specific 66–76 motif and crucial peptide-anchoring positions in the so-called B-pocket of the antigen-binding groove (11Sibilio L. Martayan A. Setini A. Fraioli R. Fruci D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Giacomini P. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have also shown that free HLA-C heavy chains are thermally unstable, peptide-free, and essentially unreceptive to peptides in in vitro assembly assays, i.e. their binding groove is in an “open” (as defined in Refs. 2Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. Yu L. Mitaksov V. Fremont D.H. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 100-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and 3Arosa F.A. Santos S.G. Powis S.J. Trends Immunol. 2007; 28: 115-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) conformation. Consistent with these biochemical features, β2m-free HLA-C heavy chains associate primarily with calnexin and, in much smaller amounts, with members of the peptide-loading complex, including TAP and tapasin (11Sibilio L. Martayan A. Setini A. Fraioli R. Fruci D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Giacomini P. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that β2m-free HLA-C heavy chains accumulate not only at the calnexin/β2m checkpoint in β2m-defective mutants (as would be expected if they just failed to bind β2m), but also at subsequent steps, on several distinct chaperones acting in sequence, and even in the absence of obvious defects in the antigen-processing/peptide-loading machinery (11Sibilio L. Martayan A. Setini A. Fraioli R. Fruci D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Giacomini P. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 12Giacomini P. Beretta A. Nicotra M.R. Ciccarelli G. Martayan A. Cerboni C. Lopalco L. Bini D. Delfino L. Ferrara G.B. Siccardi A.G. Natali P.G. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 50: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The second class of incompletely folded class I heavy chain intermediates are β2m-associated. Like free heavy chains, they are thermally unstable and peptide-free (i.e. they also meet the definition of open conformers), but unlike free heavy chains, they are associated primarily with TAP and are peptide-receptive. It has been proposed that these HLA-C/β2m dimers are intermediates awaiting peptide loading and that they exhibit an exceedingly long “standby” TAP association because the mechanism of in vivo peptide loading of HLA-C is particularly selective (9Neisig A. Melief C.J.M. Neefjes J.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 171-179PubMed Google Scholar). One may therefore ask whether the “backward” accumulation of multiple folding intermediates scattered on distinct chaperones might result from a single downstream bottleneck (i.e. selective peptide loading). Furthermore, one may ask whether a common structural feature, e.g. the KYRV motif (5Zemmour J. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), underlies the holdback of un/misfolded intermediates from the productive assembly pathway. If this is the case, all the heavy chain alleles sharing a given motif would be expected to accumulate as unstable/open conformers. In addition, the same HLA-C-specific motif(s) might confer local and generalized unfolding and promote strong association with TAP as well as tapasin in the peptide-loading complex. To address these issues, we have assessed the accumulation of open heavy chain intermediates of the eight serologically defined HLA-C alleles, of selected HLA-A and HLA-B alleles, and of the interlocus recombinant HLA-B46 (B*4601) allele, in which the HLA-C-specific KYRV motif from HLA-Cw1 (Cw*0102) has been neatly transferred into an HLA-B (B*1501) heavy chain background (13Barber L.D. Percival L. Valiante N.M. Chen L. Lee C. Gumperz J.E. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Bigge J.C. Parekh R.B. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as the result of a gene conversion event. The accumulation of open conformers has been compared, taking advantage of an additional feature of antibody L31 (14Setini A. Beretta A. De Santis C. Meneveri R. Martayan A. Mazzilli M.C. Appella E. Siccardi A.G. Natali P.G. Giacomini P. Hum. Immunol. 1996; 46: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar): its ability to bind all the HLA-C alleles and a few HLA-B alleles (HLA-B7, -B8, -B35 -B51, -B54, and -B56) displaying different abilities to assemble (8Neefjes J.J. Ploegh H.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 15Hill A. Takiguchi M. McMichael A. Immunogenetics. 1993; 37: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments, molecular dynamics simulation studies of the packing forces of conformed class I heavy chains differing in the KYRV motif, and expression of one HLA-C allele (HLA-Cw1) in TAP- and tapasin-defective cells indicate that old and novel (described herein) features of HLA-C have a common denominator in the architecture of the binding groove. Cell Lines—The 721.221 and 721.220 cell lines (referred to as 221 and 220 hereafter, respectively) were obtained in the same γ-irradiation/mutagenesis experiment from parental 721 lymphoblastoid cells (16Greenwood R. Shimizu Y. Sekhon G.S. DeMars R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5525-5536PubMed Google Scholar). The former are completely defective in HLA-A, -B, and -C, but retain HLA-E expression (17Shimizu Y. Geraghty D.E. Koller B.H. Orr H.T. DeMars R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 18Lee N. Goodlett D.R. Ishitani A. Marquardt H. Geraghty D.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4951-4960PubMed Google Scholar); the latter are defective in HLA-A and HLA-B, but retain ∼50% of HLA-Cw*0102 (Cw1) expression and, in addition, lack functional tapasin (16Greenwood R. Shimizu Y. Sekhon G.S. DeMars R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5525-5536PubMed Google Scholar). The TAP-defective 174×CEM.T2 cells (referred to as T2) express HLA-A2, -B51, and -Cw1 (19Steinle A. Schendel D.J. Tissue Antigens. 1994; 44: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) heavy chains in the absence of TAP as a result of somatic hybridization between the TAP-defective 174 cell line (also a derivative of 221) and the T lymphoid cell line CEM. The HLA-A, -B, and -C transfectants in 221 were obtained through the courtesy of several investigators (see “Acknowledgments”) and are referenced elsewhere (14Setini A. Beretta A. De Santis C.

Polyclonal antibodies to calnexin and calreticulin were from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada). Immunochemical Methods—Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (9.25 MBq/ml) as described in the figure legends and solubilized with either 1.0% Nonidet P-40 or 0.5% CHAPS in phosphate-buffered saline (0.01 m phosphate (pH 7.0) and 0.15 m NaCl). For immunoprecipitation, purified antibodies were covalently linked to Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad). The isoelectric focusing (IEF) and Western blot techniques (reducing conditions in all cases) used have been described (11Sibilio L. Martayan A. Setini A. Fraioli R. Fruci D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F.

In vitro assembly experiments were performed exactly as described in the presence of the NCPERIITL Cw1 ligand (11Sibilio L. Martayan A. Setini A. Fraioli R. Fruci D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations—Models of the isolated heavy chains of HLA-B15 (B*1501), HLA-B27 (B*2705), HLA-B46 (B*4601), and HLA-Cw1 (Cw*0102) were created, and molecular dynamics simulations were performed and analyzed using InsightII, Biopolymer, Discover3, and Analysis (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). No explicit water molecules were included, and electrostatic forces were modeled using a distance-dependent dielectric constant (4*r). The combined valence force field was used with cell multipole summation, fourth order Taylor series expansions, and 1.0-Å update width. Initially, heterotrimer models were created either directly from or by homology with appropriate published crystallographically resolved structures in the Macromolecular Structure Database: HLA-B15 and HLA-B46 from HLA-B*1501 (Protein Data Bank code 1XR9) (25Roder G.

Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1300-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), HLA-B27 from HLA-B*2705 (code 1JGE) (26Hulsmeyer M. Hillig R.C. Volz A. Ruhl M. Schroder W. Saenger W. Ziegler A.

Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Unwanted peptide chains, crystallographic water molecules, and heteroatoms were removed, hydrogen atoms were added, and the models were energy-minimized with the Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient method. Peptide and β2m chains were then removed, and the isolated heavy chain models were again energy-minimized as described above. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out with velocity Verlet integration at 1.0-fs intervals using NVT ensembles at the temperatures specified for 100,000 iterations. Initial heating steps of 1000 iterations were used, after which trajectories were saved every 500 iterations. An Abundant Pool of Free HLA-C Heavy Chain Conformers in B Lymphoid Cells—It was shown in a previous study (11Sibilio L. Martayan A. Setini A. Fraioli R. Fruci D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Giacomini P. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that the β2m-free heavy chain conformers reactive with antibody L31 are unable to stably assemble with peptides and β2m, whereas the β2m-associated conformers reactive with F4/326 and W6/32 do assemble with peptides in vivo as well as in vitro. The combined pulse-chase/thermal stability experiment shown in Fig. 1A was carried out in stable Cw1 transfectants of the 221 cell line (221.Cw1) to estimate the turnover of the two conformers and the kinetics of acquisition of thermal stability by β2m-associated conformers. During the first part of the chase (until the 105-min point), L31 conformers slowly and progressively declined, whereas F4/326 conformers gradually increased (lanes 1–5 and 7–11, respectively), as expected (11Sibilio L. Martayan A. Setini A. Fraioli R. Fruci D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Giacomini P. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Setini A. Beretta A. De Santis C. Meneveri R. Martayan A. Mazzilli M.C. Appella E. Siccardi A.G. Natali P.G. Giacomini P. Hum. Immunol. 1996; 46: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although thermal stability (indicative of stable peptide binding) was acquired not earlier than 45 min from synthesis (compare lanes 7–9 and 13–15 and lanes 10 and 16). From this point on, accumulation of F4/326 conformers and acquisition of thermal stability simultaneously increased, peaked at 105 min (lanes 11 and 17), and then simultaneously declined (lanes 12 and 18). Based on these kinetics and turnover profiles, a 2-h continuous metabolic labeling can be predicted to provide a cumulative estimate of the stoichiometry of β2m-free and β2m-associated conformers throughout the crucial period of productive class I assembly, before the beginning of disposal. Conformer ratios (a measure of stable folding/assembly) were therefore evaluated under these metabolic labeling conditions in a panel of 221 cells transfected with single class I alleles, including seven serologically defined HLA-C alleles, two HLA-B alleles (HLA-B7 and HLA-B51) representative of good and poor assembly efficiencies, respectively (15Hill A. Takiguchi M. McMichael A. Immunogenetics. 1993; 37: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), two alleles (HLA-A2 and HLA-B15) lacking the crucial residues forming the optimal L31 epitope (14Setini A. Beretta A. De Santis C. Meneveri R. Martayan A. Mazzilli M.C. Appella E. Siccardi A.G. Natali P.G. Giacomini P. Hum. Immunol. 1996; 46: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the interlocus recombinant HLA-B46 allele. Representative results of immunoprecipitation experiments with L31 and W6/32 (F4/326 gave similar results; data not shown) are depicted in Fig. 1B. Whereas W6/32 conformers were detected at high levels in all the 221 transfectants (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 19, and 23), L31 conformers ranged from barely detectable in 221.B7 (lane 10) to intermediate levels in 221.B51 (lane 7) and up to levels comparable with those of the W6/32 conformers in 221.Cw1 (lane 1), 221.Cw7 (lane 4), 221.Cw3, 221.Cw4, 221.Cw5, 221.Cw6, and 221.Cw8 (data not shown and see below) (12Giacomini P. Beretta A. Nicotra M.R. Ciccarelli G. Martayan A. Cerboni C. Lopalco L. Bini D. Delfino L. Ferrara G.B. Siccardi A.G. Natali P.G.

Giacomini P. Hum. Immunol. 1996; 46: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and, most notably, 221.B46 (lane 22). HLA-B46 (B*4601) carries the HLA-C-distinctive KYRV motif, absent in HLA-B15 (B*1501), at residues 66–76 in the α1-domain α-helix (13Barber L.D. Percival L. Valiante N.M. Chen L. Lee C. Gumperz J.E. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Bigge J.C. Parekh R.B. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but the two alleles are otherwise identical. Consequently, HLA-B15 does not contain residues 66–68 specifying the L31 epitope (also see lane 18) (14Setini A. Beretta A. De Santis C. Meneveri R. Martayan A. Mazzilli M.C. Appella E. Siccardi A.G. Natali P.G. Giacomini P. Hum. Immunol. 1996; 46: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In view of this, a comparison of free heavy chain accumulation between HLA-B46 and HLA-B15 was carried out using Q1/28, an antibody to conserved α3-domain residues preferentially carried by free heavy chains (21Benjamin R.J. Abrams J.R. Parnes J.R. Madrigal J.A. Parham P. Immunogenetics. 1992; 37: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Q1/28 revealed a much greater accumulation of HLA-B46 than HLA-B15 free heavy chains (compare lanes 17 and 21). Thus, HLA-B46 free heavy chains bear at least two local unfolding regions: in the α1-domain α-helix (e.g. the very site of gene conversion, revealed by L31) and in the α3-domain (revealed by Q1/28). It can be concluded from Fig. 1B that the HLA-C-specific 66–76 motif correlates with and confers poor assembly and folding impairment. Impaired and Unstable Assembly Is a Locus-specific Feature of HLA-C—The data in Fig. 1 provide initial evidence that the accumulation of L31 conformers is a feature of HLA-C shared with HLA-B46. It remains to be established whether this accumulation results from (a) poor assembly, (b) increased dissociation, or (c) both. In addition, trivial causes of inaccuracy must be excluded, such as (d) the inclusion of non-classical class I HLA molecules (expressed by 221 cells) in the W6/32 conformer pool and (e) different integrated copy numbers of the transfected class I alleles in distinct 221 transfectants. Different copy numbers may result in different levels of class I heavy chain expression against a background of similar (and possibly limiting) class I chaperoning. To distinguish among features a, b, and c and to rule out features d and e, we determined the extent as well as the kinetics of the accumulation of the different heavy chain conformers by pulse-chase experiments and resolved the individual class I alleles coexpressed in different cell lines by IEF. In addition to 221 transfectants, HLA homozygous B lymphoid heavy chains (17 alleles altogether), three of these (JY, CJO, and EDR) simultaneously express one L31-reactive HLA-B allele and one L31-reactive HLA-C allele, making them suitable for stringent allele comparisons. Representative results in two cell lines are shown in Fig. 2, and a synopsis of the densitometric data of HLA-C- and HLA-B-specific bands for all the tested Y/F67+ HLA-C and HLA-B alleles is shown in Fig. 3.FIGURE 3Densitometry of pulse-chase analysis. The same pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiments performed in the representative cell lines displayed in Fig. 2 were carried out in HLA homozygous cell lines simultaneously expressing two L31-reactive alleles, e.g. JY (B7 and Cw7), CJO (B35 and Cw4), and EDR (B56 and Cw2), as well as HLA homozygous cell lines and single-allele 221 transfectants expressing one L31-reactive allele, e.g. JHAF (B51), WT46 (Cw5), LBF (Cw6), 221.B*0702, 221.B*4601, 221.B*5101, 221.Cw*0102, 221.Cw*0301, and 221.Cw*0802. Class I heavy chain components were assigned to specific alleles based on previous IEF comparisons with HLA-C transfectants (12Giacomini P. Beretta A. Nicotra M.R. Ciccarelli G. Martayan A.

IEF bands were scanned, and densitometric values of all the bands of a given allele in a given immunoprecipitate and at a given time point were summed. This resulted in 104 cumulative estimates of free and β2m-associated heavy chains accumulating over time, sorted by allele (13 panels, one for each L31-reactive allele) and antibody (L31 (▪) and W6/32 (○)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"

It catalyzes the nucleophilic attack of phenolic xenobiotics on UDP-glucuronic acid, leading to the formation of water-soluble glucuronides. The catalytic mechanism proposed for this reaction is an acid-base mechanism that involves an aspartic/glutamic acid and/or histidine residue. Here, we investigated the role of 14 highly conserved aspartic/glutamic acid residues over the entire sequence of human UGT1A6 by site-directed mutagenesis. We showed that except for aspartic residues Asp-150 and Asp-488, the substitution of carboxylic residues by alanine led to active mutants but with decreased enzyme activity and lower affinity for acceptor and/or donor substrate. Further analysis including mutation of the corresponding residue in other UGT1A isoforms suggests that Asp-150 plays a major catalytic role. In this report we also identified a single active site residue important for glucuronidation of phenols and carboxylic acid substrates by UGT1A enzyme family. Replacing Pro-40 of UGT1A4 by histidine expanded the glucuronidation activity of the enzyme to phenolic and carboxylic compounds, therefore, leading to UGT1A3-type isoform in terms of substrate specificity. Conversely, when His-40 residue of UGT1A3 was replaced with proline, the substrate specificity shifted toward that of UGT1A4 with loss of glucuronidation of phenolic substrates. Furthermore, mutation of His-39 residue of UGT1A1 (His-40 in UGT1A4) to proline led to loss of glucuronidation of phenols but not of estrogens.

UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs, 2The abbreviations used are:UGTUDP-glucuronosyltransferase4-MU4-methylumbelliferoneGlcUAglucuronic acid. EC 2.4.1.17) constitute a superfamily of enzymes that are involved in the phase II biotransformation pathway of many drugs and xenobiotics from natural or synthetic origin (1Clarke D.J. Burchell B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 112. Springer, Berlin1994: 3-43Google Scholar). UGTs are inverting glycosyltransferases belonging to the wide family 1 of NDP-sugar hexosyltransferases (2Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). They catalyze the transfer of glucuronic acid from the high energy donor substrate UDP-α-d-glucuronic acid on hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amine groups of structurally unrelated acceptor molecules, leading to the formation of β-d-glucuronides. The hydrophilic glucuronides are readily excreted from the body via urine and bile. Endogenous compounds, such as bilirubin and ligands of nuclear receptors (fatty acids, estrogens, retinoic acid) are also substrates of UGTs. Thus, these enzymes expressed in several tissues such as liver, lung, brain, kidney, and gastro-intestinal tract play a major role in both physiological and toxicological processes (3Tukey R.H. Strassburg C.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 581-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronic acid The UGT1A6 isoform is encoded by the UGT1 gene locus, which is also responsible for the expression of eight other functional UGT1A proteins (UGT1A1, -1A3, -1A4, -1A5, -1A7, -1A8, -1A9, and -1A10). These isoforms present a distinct but overlapping substrate specificity. The preferred substrates are bilirubin for UGT1A1, carboxyl drugs for UGT1A3, anti-psychotic amines for UGT1A4, 1-hydroxy-[a]-benzopyrene for UGT1A5, planar phenols for UGT1A6, and phenolic and carboxyl substances for UGT1A7, -1A8, and -1A9 (4Green M.D. King C.D.

Ther. 2005; 106: 97-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Each isoform results from the alternate splicing of different exons 1 encoding the variable N-terminal half of the protein with the four common 2–5 exons encoding the C-terminal half. The N-terminal sequence of different isoforms is, therefore, predicted to interact with the acceptor substrates and is responsible for the substrate specificity, whereas the invariant C-terminal sequence would interact with the common donor substrate, UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA). UGT1A6 isoform is expressed in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues (6Radominska-Pandya A. Czernik P.J. Little J.M. Battaglia E. Mackenzie P.I. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 817-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and is recognized as one of the main enzymes involved in the glucuronidation of phenols (7Tephly T.R. Burchell B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 276-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibitory antibodies raised against the C-terminal end of UGT1A6 protein indicated that this isoform contributed up to 60% in the glucuronidation of phenolic substances in human liver (8Ouzzine M. Pillot T. Fournel-Gigleux S. Burchell B. Siest G. Magdalou J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, UGT1A6 is involved in glucuronidation of drugs, such as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen, the analgesic drug paracetamol (9Bock K.W. Forster A. Gschaidmeier H. Brück M. Münzel P. Schareck W. Fournel-Gigleux S. Burchell B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1809-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the vasorelaxant naftazone (10Herber R. Hercelin B. Van Cantfort J. De Graeve J. Fournel-Gigleux S. Taguchi T. Magdalou J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 1305-1314PubMed Google Scholar), and carcinogens (hydroxyl polycyclic arylhydrocarbons) (11Bock K.W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 129-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recently, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and its analogs such as 5-hydroxytryptophol have also been identified as substrates for human UGT1A6 (12King C.D. Rios G.R. Assouline J.A. Tephly T.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Krishnaswamy S. Hao Q. Von Moltke L.L. Greenblatt D.J. Court M.H. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of UGTs in the bioavailability of drugs and endogenous compounds, the structural determinants that are critical for the reaction mechanism and the molecular basis of substrate recognition have not been elucidated yet. Recently, the structure of the cofactor binding domain of UGT2B7 has been solved, and several amino acids interacting with the co-substrate (UDP-GlcUA) have been identified (14Miley M.J. Zielinska A Keenan K.J.E. Bratton S.M. Anna Radominska-Pandya A. Redinbo M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the lack of information on the three-dimensional structure of the substrate binding domain and of the full-length protein due to difficulties in crystallizing these membrane proteins has impaired a better understanding of the active site organization and of the glucuronidation process. Among other glycosyltransferases, several members have been crystallized and their three-dimensional structure solved. Interestingly, despite their functional diversity, their structures fall into two different canonical folds only, termed GT-A and GT-B (15Breton C. Snajdrova L. Jeanneau C. Koea J. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). By analogy, the bi-domain organization of the UGTs in which the N- and C-terminal halves appear to be responsible for interaction with the acceptor and donor substrate, respectively, suggests that they would adopt a three-dimensional structure similar to that found in GT-B enzymes. It has been proposed that the reaction mechanism of GT-B involves a general base (histidine, aspartic, or glutamic acid) initiating catalysis by abstracting a proton from the reactive group of aglycone and allowing the direct nucleophilic attack at the donor sugar C1 carbon center (16Unligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Structural analyses and site-directed mutagenesis studies of GT-B members, MurG (17Hu Y. Chen L.

Davis B.G. Tarling C.A. Ford C.M. Bowles D.J. Davies G.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1396-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), and T4-BGT (20Lariviere L. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Morera S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggested that histidine and aspartic acid residues His-19, Asp-13, His-20, and Asp-100, respectively, act as a catalytic base (19Offen W. Martinez-Fleites C. Yang M. Kiat-Lim E. Davis B.G. Tarling C.A. Ford C.M. Bowles D.J. Davies G.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1396-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Furthermore, His-22 has also been found to be critical for catalysis by the plant UGT71G1, whereas Asp-122 was shown to be a key residue that may assist deprotonation of the acceptor substrate by forming an electron transfer chain with the catalytic base, His-22 (21Shao H. He X. Achnine L. Blount J.W. Dixon R.A. Wang X. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3141-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). An acid-base mechanism has also been proposed for the glucuronidation reaction catalyzed by human UGT1A6 based on irreversible inactivation of the recombinant UGT1A6 by the histidyl- and carboxyl-directed electrophilic probes, diethylpyrocarbonate and carbodiimides, respectively (22Battaglia E. Pritchard M. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. Radominska A. Siest G. Magdalou J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Battaglia E. Senay C. Fournel-Gigleux S. Herber R. Siest G. Magdalou J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using this approach along with site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that histidine residue His-370 plays an important role in the catalytic process (24Ouzzine M. Antonio L. Burchell B. Netter P. Fournel-Gigleux S. Magdalou J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Indeed, sequence alignment of GT-B proteins with UGT1A6 revealed that His-370 corresponds to the histidine residue of a common HX7E motif present in GT-B glycosyltransferases, known to play an important role in stabilizing the leaving UDP group of the donor substrate UDP-GlcUA during catalysis (18Mulichak A.M. Losey H.C. Lu W. Wawrzak Z. Walsh C.T. Garavito R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Ha S. Gross B. Walker S. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2001; 1: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this paper we have investigated the role of conserved aspartic and glutamic acid residues of the human UGT1A6 in the glucuronidation mechanism. Each of these amino acids was individually mutated, and the mutant enzymes were analyzed in terms of enzyme activity and kinetic properties. Our results suggest that the aspartic residue Asp-150 plays a key role in the glucuronidation reaction and provide evidence that it participates to the catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, analysis of the role of histidine residue His-38 of UGT1A6, which corresponds to a predicted catalytic base His-22 of the plant UGT71G1, and of its counterpart Pro-40 in UGT1A3 and His-40 in UGT1A4 demonstrated that it governs the substrate specificity of these UGT isoforms toward phenolic and carboxylic substrates. Reagents—Aglycone substrates for glucuronidation assays were of the highest purity available and were purchased from Sigma. UDP-[U-14C]glucuronic acid (418 mCi/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction enzymes were provided by New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and Advantage® 2 polymerase mix was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The yeast culture medium was from Difco. The Pichia pastoris expression system was from Invitrogen. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies for Western blot detection were from Sigma. All other reagents were of the best quality and commercially available. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—cDNA sequences encoding human UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT1A4, UGT1A3, and UGT1A1 were cloned from human liver library (Clontech) and inserted into EcoRI-XhoI or PmlI-XhoI sites of the yeast expression vector pPICZB. The recombinant vectors pPICZ-UGT1A6, pPICZ-UGT1A9, pPICZ-UGT1A4, pPICZ-UGT1A3, and pPICZ-UGT1A1 were used for expression of recombinant UGTs in P. pastoris as previously described (24Ouzzine M.

Stable transformants were selected on YPD plates (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose) containing 100 μg/ml zeocin. Transformed cells were grown in BMGY medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, and 1% (v/v) glycerol) for 24 h at 30 °C. Expression was induced by methanol in BMGM medium (BMGY with 1% (v/v) glycerol replaced by 2% (v/v) methanol) and carried out for 48 h at 30 °C in a rotary shaker at 215 rpm (26Ouzzine M. Magdalou J. Burchell B. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31401-31409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation of Recombinant Yeast Cells—Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min and further submitted to subcellular fractionation as previously described (24Ouzzine M. Antonio L. Burchell B. Netter P. Fournel-Gigleux S. Magdalou J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, after harvesting, cells were washed once and suspended in cold breaking buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% (v/v) glycerol). The cells were then broken with glass beads. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Membranes were then pelleted from the supernatant by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was resuspended by Dounce homogenization in 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). Immunoblot Analysis—Protein concentration was evaluated by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217486) Google Scholar). 30 μg of membrane proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting using anti-C-terminal peptide anti-UGT1A6 antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies, as described previously (24Ouzzine M. Antonio L. Burchell B. Netter P. Fournel-Gigleux S. Magdalou J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Enzyme Activity—Glucuronidation activity toward 4-MU was measured according to the method of Lilienblum et al. (29Lilienblum W. Walli A.K. Bock K.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurement of the glucuronide at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 380 nm, respectively, was carried out on a Hitachi F2000 spectrofluorimeter (ScienceTec, Les Ullis, France) with 4-MU-β-d-glucuronide (0–10 nmol) as a standard. The activity of recombinant wild-type UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT1A4, and UGT1A3 and of corresponding mutants toward selected substrates was determined by thin layer chromatography as described (30Bansal S.K. Gessner T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, incubation in Eppendorf tubes (total volume 40 μl) consisted of 50 μg of microsomal proteins in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2 containing 0.1 mm UDP-GlcUA and 0.1 μCi UDP-[U-14C]glucuronic acid. The reaction was started by the addition of substrate (0.5 mm, final concentration) dissolved in 2 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide. A control was performed in which the substrate was omitted and contained dimethyl sulfoxide. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the proteins were precipitated by 40 μl ethanol on ice and removed by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto thin layer chromatography plates (LK6DF silica gel, 250 μm, Whatman, Clifton, NJ). The plates were developed with n-butanol, acetone, acetic acid, aqueous ammonia (28%), water (70:50:18:1.5:60, v/v) and with n-butanol, acetone, water, and ammonium hydroxide (35:35:20:10, v/v) in the case of amine substrates. They were dried and sprayed with 1% (v/v) 2-(4-t-butylphenyl)-5(-4-biphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole in toluene. The radioactivity associated to the glucuronide was visualized by autoradiography with X-Omat Kodak film (Sigma) for 3 days or 6 days at -20 °C. The silica gel areas of the glucuronides were scraped off, and the associated radioactivity was quantified on a LKB spectrometer using Fluoran Safe Ultima Gold scintillant mixture (Packard Instrument Co.). The dpm value corresponding to the activity of a given sample was considered significant when it was at least 2-fold that of the control sample. Determination of Kinetic Parameters—Apparent kinetic constants Km and Vmax toward 4-MU were determined by incubating yeast microsomes with increasing concentrations of 4-MU (0.01–2.0 mm) in the presence of a fixed concentration of UDP-GlcUA (5.0 mm). The apparent kinetic constants toward UDP-GlcUA were obtained using a constant amount of 4-MU (1 mm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of UDP-GlcUA (0.025 to 10 mm). Km and Vmax values were determined using nonlinear least squares analysis of the data fitted to Michaelis-Menten rate equation (v = Vmax × [S]/Km + [S]) using the curve-fitter program Sigmaplot 9.0™ (31Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 18-99Google Scholar). Expression and Kinetic Parameters of Wild-type UGT1A6 and Mutants—In an attempt to identify the carboxylic amino acid potentially involved in UGT catalysis, we have performed a sequence alignment of several mammalian UGT isoforms and identified 14 highly conserved aspartic/glutamic acid residues over the entire sequence of human UGT1A6, i.e. Asp-145, Asp-150, Glu-287, Glu-289, Glu-314, Asp-357, Glu-378, Asp-394, Asp-397, Asp-420, Asp-447, Asp-454, Glu-461, and Asp-488 (Fig. 1). To address the importance of these invariant amino acids in glucuronidation mechanism, each of them was mutated to alanine (non-conservative mutation) and to aspartic or glutamic acid (conservative mutation), and the recombinant proteins were produced in yeast P. pastoris. We first examined the role of aspartic acid residues by engineering the corresponding alanine mutants D145A, D150A, D357A, D394A, D397A, D420A, D447A, D454A, and D488A. Upon expression, Western blot analysis showed that recombinant wild-type UGT1A6 and mutants were expressed at similar or higher levels than the wild-type protein (Fig. 2A). The amount of mutant protein was evaluated by scanning densitometry, and all activities were normalized relative to the wild-type UGT1A6. To evaluate the consequences of the mutations on the enzyme function, we analyzed the activity (Fig. 2B) and determined kinetic parameters of recombinant wild-type and mutant enzymes using 4-MU as reference acceptor substrate (Table 2). Interestingly, the results showed that except for D150A and D488A, all the alanine-substituted mutants exhibited enzyme activity, although compared with wild-type it was reduced by 5-, 3.2-, 5.6-, 2-, 29-, and 3-fold for D145A, D357A, D397A, D420A, D447A, and D454A, respectively (Fig. 2B). In the case of D394A mutant, only a slight decrease in activity was observed (about 20%). It is noteworthy that mutation of Asp-447 by alanine (D447A) strongly reduced enzyme activity (29-fold). However, replacement of this residue with glutamic acid (D447E) restored the activity of the enzyme but dramatically increased the Km value (>10 mm) for the donor substrate with no change in the Km for the acceptor substrate (Table 2), suggesting the importance of Asp-447 residue in the interaction of the enzyme with UDP-GlcUA.FIGURE 2Effect of substitution of conserved carboxylic acid residues with alanine on UGT1A6 activity. Immunoblot and enzyme activity analyses of UGT1A6 aspartic acid mutants (A and B) and UGT1A6 glutamic acid mutants (C and D) are shown. 30 μg of membrane proteins from recombinant yeast cells were loaded in each lane (A and C). Glucuronidation activity (B and D) of wild type (WT) and the mutants toward 4-MU substrate was carried out according to the method of Lilienblum et al. (29Lilienblum W. Walli A.K. Bock K.W. Biochem.

Upon expression in P. pastoris, immunoblot analysis showed that all the mutants were produced in similar or higher amounts compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2C). Analysis of the effect of the mutations of glutamic acid to alanine residues on the enzyme activity showed that, in contrast to aspartic acid to alanine substitutions, none of the alanine mutations abrogated the enzyme activity (Fig. 2D). Indeed, all the mutants exhibited enzyme activity, although compared with wild-type, it was reduced by 1.4-, 3.2-, 2-, and 7-fold for E287A, E289A, E297A, E314A, respectively, and by 150- and 350-fold for E378A and E461A mutants, respectively (Fig. 2D). Further analyses were conducted to determine the importance of Glu-378 and Glu-461 residues. For this purpose we constructed and expressed mutants with Glu-378 and Glu-461 individually replaced by a conservative amino acid, aspartic acid, or with serine or glutamine residues, i.e. E378D, E378S, E461D, E461S, and E461Q. Analysis of the enzyme activity showed that E378D and E378S mutants exhibited similar Vmax values compared with the alanine-substituted mutant E378A (Table 2). Similarly, E461D and E461S presented Vmax values close to that of E461A mutant. In contrast, replacement of Glu-461 with glutamine led to E461Q mutant with a Vmax value 25-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme but 20-fold higher than that of E461D and E461S mutants (Table 2). These results showed that both Glu-378 and Glu-461 residues could be replaced to some extent by non-carboxylic amino acids, suggesting that carboxylic amino acids at these positions are i"

They are highly activated in peripheral blood of patients with unstable angina. Moreover, a primed state of circulating neutrophils has been proposed in patients with stable angina. Our aim was to investigate the neutrophil activation status in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) at conventional drug treatment. Methodology and Principal Findings Thirty patients with stable CAD and 30 healthy controls were included using a paired design. The neutrophil expression of CD18 and high-affinity state of CD11b was analysed by flow cytometry before and after stimulation with chemoattractants. Also, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined by chemiluminescence. During basal conditions, the neutrophil expression of CD18 or high-affinity state of CD11b did not differ between patients and controls. Chemoattractants (Interleukin-8 and Leukotriene B4) did not increase either the expression or the amount of high-affinity CD11b/CD18-integrins in CAD patients compared to controls, and had no effect on the production of ROS. On the other hand, the ROS production in response to C3bi-opsonised yeast particles and the neutrophils' inherent capacity to produce ROS were both significantly decreased in patients. Conclusion/Significance We could not find any evidence that neutrophils in patients with stable CAD were primed, i.e. more prone to activation, compared to cells from healthy controls. According to our data, the circulating neutrophils in CAD patients rather showed an impaired activation status. It remains to be elucidated whether the neutrophil dysfunction in CAD is mainly a marker of chronic disease, an atherogenic factor or a consequence of the drug treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2079289285,"A selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element in the 3′-untranslated region and an in-frame UGA codon are the requisite cis-acting elements for the incorporation of selenocysteine into selenoproteins. Equally important are the trans-acting factors SBP2, Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec, and eEFSec. Multiple in-frame UGAs and two SECIS elements make the mRNA encoding selenoprotein P (Sel P) unique. To study the role of codon context in determining the efficiency of UGA readthrough at each of the 10 rat Sel P Sec codons, we individually cloned 27-nucleotide-long fragments representing each UGA codon context into a luciferase reporter construct harboring both Sel P SECIS elements. Significant differences, spanning an 8-fold range of UGA readthrough efficiency, were observed, but these differences were dramatically reduced in the presence of excess SBP2. Mutational analysis of the “fourth base” of contexts 1 and 5 revealed that only the latter followed the established rules for hierarchy of translation termination. In addition, mutations in either or both of the Sel P SECIS elements resulted in differential effects on UGA readthrough. Interestingly, even when both SECIS elements harbored a mutation of the core region required for Sec incorporation, context 5 retained a significantly higher level of readthrough than context 1. We also show that SBP2-dependent Sec incorporation is able to repress G418-induced UGA readthrough as well as eRF1-induced stimulation of termination. We conclude that a large codon context forms a cis-element that works together with Sec incorporation factors to determine readthrough efficiency.

Gene (Amst.). 2003; 312: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Selenoproteins are primarily involved in protecting the cell from oxidative stress, and the concerted effort of several protein factors and RNA elements is required for the production of these proteins (2Driscoll D.M. Copeland P.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2003; 23: 17-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Two cis-elements in the mRNA are required for the incorporation of selenocysteine into a nascent polypeptide. These are an in-frame UGA codon and a structure called the SECIS (Sec insertion sequence) element (3Caban K. Copeland P.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The SECIS element is a stem loop structure consisting of a core stem and a terminal bulge or loop. The SECIS core is comprised of an AUGA motif positioned opposite a GA dinucleotide forming a non-Watson-Crick base-paired quartet, thus making this RNA a member of the kink-turn family of RNA motifs (3Caban K. Copeland P.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The terminus of the SECIS stem consists of either a 9–11-nucleotide loop (designated Form 1) or a 5′ bulge followed by a smaller 6-nucleotide loop (designated Form 2). Both SECIS forms contain a conserved AAR motif within the loop or bulge, respectively (4Grundner-Culemann E. Martin 3rd, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA (N.

Recently ribosomal protein L30 has been found to interact with the SECIS element but whether it is required for Sec incorporation remains to be determined (8Chavatte L. Brown B.A. Driscoll D.M. Nat.

Most selenoprotein mRNAs contain only a single Sec codon and a single SECIS element. The selenoprotein P (Sel P) mRNA is unique because it contains multiple Sec codons ranging from 10 in mammals to a maximum of 18 in some amphibians (9Berry M.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 389-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 10Hill K.E. Lloyd R.S. Yang J.G. Read R. Burk R.F. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition to termination at its naturally occurring stop codon, rat Sel P has protein isoforms resulting from termination at the second, third, and seventh UGAs (12Ma S. Hill K.E. Caprioli R.M. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12749-12754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The in vivo frequency of translation termination at these UGAs is not known, but these isoforms have been observed in preparations of Sel P purified from rat serum (12Ma S. Hill K.E. Caprioli R.M. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12749-12754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The role of the dual SECIS elements has only recently been studied in detail. In 2006 Stoytcheva et al. (13Stoytcheva Z. Tujebajeva R.M. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9177-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) determined that the second SECIS element of zebrafish Sel P was required for readthrough of the first UGA and the first SECIS element was necessary for readthrough of subsequent UGAs and consequently, production of full-length protein (13Stoytcheva Z. Tujebajeva R.M. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9177-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic basis for this distinction of function remains elusive. Studies in bacteria and eukaryotes have shown that translation termination is influenced by the bases near the stop codon, with a strong bias toward nucleotides 3′ of the stop codon (14Mottagui-Tabar S. Bjornsson A. Isaksson L.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Namy O. Hatin I. Rousset J.P.

These findings support the model that translation termination is dictated by more than three residues with the identity of the base at the fourth position (+4 position; hereafter referred to as the “fourth base”) contributing to the efficiency of translation termination. In several organisms including Escherichia coli and mammals, the strength of a translation termination context follows the order of A > G > C > U, where an mRNA with a stop codon followed by an A is terminated more efficiently than one with a U at the same position (16Poole E.S. Brown C.M. Tate W.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 17Cridge A.G. Major L.L. Mahagaonkar A.A. Poole E.S. Isaksson L.A. Tate W.P.

A. 1995; 92: 5431-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that translation termination is determined by a combination of the identity of the stop codon and the nucleotide at the fourth base (16Poole E.S. Brown C.M. Tate W.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 17Cridge A.G. Major L.L. Mahagaonkar A.A. Poole E.S. Isaksson L.A. Tate W.P.

Studies have shown the ratio of Sec incorporation to termination also to be affected by the base immediately 3′ of the Sec codon. The rules for termination at a Sec codon differ from the A > G > C > U rule observed in non-Sec codons in mammals and E. coli. A study examining the effect of the fourth base on the porcine phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase UGA readthrough found it to be highest with the native fourth base, a G (20Nasim M.T. Jaenecke S. Belduz A. Kollmus H. Flohe L. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14846-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A gradual decrease in readthrough was observed when the fourth base was mutated to a C or a U. An A at the fourth base of the same construct resulted in the most drastic reduction in readthrough (20Nasim M.T. Jaenecke S. Belduz A. Kollmus H. Flohe L. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14846-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A separate study of Sec incorporation in a Type 1 deiodinase reporter showed that when the Sec codon was followed by a strong termination context, an A as the fourth base, readthrough was much greater than when the codon was followed by any of the remaining three bases (21Grundner-Culemann E. Martin G.W. Tujebajeva R. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These previous studies have contributed to the model that the efficiency of Sec incorporation is not simply inversely proportional to the efficiency of translation termination, suggesting that other determinants are required for processive and efficient Sec incorporation. Previously we showed that in vitro, Sec incorporation in a monocistronic luciferase reporter bearing the rat phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase SECIS element occurs with a maximum of ∼8% efficiency. This contrasted with an ∼40% efficiency when full-length Sel P was translated in the same system, suggesting that one or more elements within the Sel P mRNA sequence were providing increased efficiency (22Mehta A. Rebsch C.M. Kinzy S.A. Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37852-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This study determines how Sel P sequences contribute to the efficiency of Sec incorporation and its interplay with translation termination. Codon Context Plasmid Construction—A firefly luciferase construct containing an in-frame UGA at position 258 was created as previously described (22Mehta A. Rebsch C.M. Kinzy S.A. Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37852-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The coding region of this construct was further mutated, 12 nucleotides upstream and downstream of UGA 258, to create AflIII and SgfI restriction sites. PacI and NotI linkers were used to clone the first 770 nucleotides of the Sel P 3′-UTR downstream of the Luc UGA open reading frame. This stretch of 3′-UTR contained both SECIS elements. Oligos, 27 nucleotides long and containing each Sel P UGA codon and its context (12 nucleotides flanking on either side), were synthesized with AflIII and SgfI linkers. These oligos were then phosphorylated and ligated into the firefly luciferase vector pre-digested with AflIII and SgfI. The reading frame of the original firefly luciferase construct was not shifted by cloning the 27-nucleotide Sel P oligos. All constructs were in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and regulated by the bacteriophage T7 promoter. Generation of Point Mutants—Point mutants were created using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Mutants were verified by automated DNA sequencing. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Constructs were linearized with either XhoI or PacI. XhoI digestion generated a template with a 3′-UTR downstream of the T7 promoter, allowing transcription of the coding region and the 770 nucleotides of the Sel P 3′-UTR. PacI digestion created a template that had the 3′-UTR, including the SECIS elements, upstream of the T7 promoter, thereby allowing transcription of only the coding region and not the 3′-UTR. The eRF1 and eEFSec constructs were digested with XbaI and HindIII, respectively. Linearized DNA was then transcribed with the T7 mMessage kit (Ambion). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) was used for in vitro translations. In vitro translations were performed with [35S]Met according to the manufacturer's protocol and three separate translations were done for each construct. Briefly, 12.5-μl reactions contained 8 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), 0.25 μl of 40 units/μl of RNasin (Promega), 0.25 μl of 1 mm amino acid mixture minus methionine, 0.5 μl of [35S]Met at 10 mCi/ml, 100 ng of reporter mRNA and varying amounts of CTSBP2 or 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The amount of CTSBP2 added to the reactions was either 0.2 or 2 pmol, but the total volume of CTSBP2 was 3 μl. CTSBP2 was diluted in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Two microliters of the translation reactions were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. As translations carried out in the absence of added SBP2 yielded a full-length product of low intensity, these reactions were exposed for up to 8 days. An overnight exposure was sufficient for reactions carried out with CTSBP2. To quantitate the bands, a rectangle or a polygon was drawn around each full-length and UGA-termination product. The background was subtracted by copying and pasting the rectangles or polygons directly above our product of interest. For co-translation experiments, 25 ng of human eRF1 and 100 ng of mouse eEFSec mRNAs were translated with the specified Sel P contexts. 75Se Labeling—Selenium 75 (400 μm at 380 mCi/mg), in the form of selenous acid (obtained from the University of Missouri Research Reactor) was first neutralized with NaOH and diluted to a working concentration of 0.8 μm. The final concentration of 75Se in our reactions was 0.064 μm. Except for the addition of 75Se, in vitro translations were carried out exactly as explained above. After the 1-h incubation, 16% of the translation reactions were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. To account for potential differences in sample loading, the SDS gel was stained with Gel Code Blue (Pierce) and an unknown protein consistently present in each sample was used to normalize the 75Se-labeled product. Preparation of CTSBP2—Recombinant Xpress/His-tagged CTSBP2 was made as previously described (23Kinzy S.A. Caban K. Copeland P.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5172-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic Analysis—Mouse, human, bovine, and orangutan Sel P Sec codons and their 12 flanking nucleotides on either side were aligned to the corresponding conserved Sec codons and their contexts in rat Sel P. WebLogo was used to graph homology (29Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8442) Google Scholar). Sel P Codon Contexts—To understand the impact of codon context on Sec incorporation, we used each of the 10 rat Sel P UGAs, along with their four flanking codons on both sides, replacing the corresponding sequence in the open reading frame of a firefly luciferase construct (Fig. 1, Sec1–Sec10). This monocistronic luciferase construct contained an in-frame UGA at codon 258 (Fig. 1, Luc UGA). A Sec codon at this position had been previously shown to permit Sec incorporation at an efficiency of ∼5–8% (22Mehta A. Rebsch C.M. Kinzy S.A. Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37852-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition to the Sel P UGA codons and their native codon contexts, our constructs also contained the first 770 nucleotides of the rat Sel P 3′-UTR including both of its SECIS elements (Fig. 1). In rat Sel P, the seventh to the 10th Sec codons are closely clustered. Consequently, Sec constructs 7–10 contained more than one inframe UGA and common or overlapping nucleotides. The overlapping UGAs, which are underlined in Fig. 1, were mutated to the UGU cysteine codon, thus generating constructs designated Sec UGU. Sec10 was further mutated to change the natural rat Sel P stop codon, UAA, to the tyrosine UAU codon, enabling us to assess its readthrough ability. As a control, we used the parent firefly luciferase construct with the in-frame UGA at amino acid 258 (Fig. 1, Luc UGA). Like the Sec constructs, the Luc UGA construct also contained the first 770 nucleotides of the rat Sel P 3′-UTR including both of the rat Sel P SECIS elements. Because RRL contains all of the factors so far identified to be required for Sec incorporation (5Copeland P.R. Fletcher J.E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Driscoll D.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 22Mehta A. Rebsch C.M. Kinzy S.A. Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37852-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we used this system to assess any differences in readthrough of the Sel P codon contexts. As expected, all of our in vitro translation reactions produced two predominant products. The larger product corresponded to the full-length polypeptide resulting from UGA readthrough, whereas the smaller product was the pre-Sec peptide resulting from termination at the UGA codon. The efficiency of translation for each construct was reported as the percent readthrough calculated by dividing the amount of fulllength polypeptide produced by the sum of the full-length and pre-Sec peptides. Most of the experiments make use of [35S]Met to label both termination and readthrough products so that we can evaluate both nonspecific readthrough as well as that resulting from Sec incorporation. Because Sec incorporation in RRL is limiting for SBP2 (22Mehta A. Rebsch C.M. Kinzy S.A. Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37852-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), all of our in vitro translations were carried out either in the absence of added SBP2 or with recombinant rat SBP2 corresponding to the fully functional C-terminal 445 amino acids and bearing an N-terminal Xpress/His tag (CTSBP2) (22Mehta A. Rebsch C.M. Kinzy S.A. Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37852-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The amount of CTSBP2 needed to reach intermediate (0.2 pmol) and saturating (2 pmol) levels of Sec incorporation was experimentally determined by using varying amounts of SBP2 in the luciferase-based Sec incorporation assay (data not shown). Assessing the efficiency of Sec incorporation in the absence of added CTSBP2 presented a challenge in that long exposures were required to acquire accurate quantitation of the readthrough product. These exposures resulted in a saturation of signal for the termination product and thus in these cases the value for efficiency was slightly overestimated. When the full-length products were normalized by comparing them to that obtained for the Luc UGA control, we calculated the level of overestimation to be a factor of 1.4 (data not shown). Sec Incorporation in Sel P Is Regulated by Codon Context—Each Sel P codon context was first in vitro translated in the absence of added SBP2, thus making use of the limiting amount of endogenous SBP2 in RRL (5Copeland P.R. Fletcher J.E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Driscoll D.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Of all the Sel P contexts with a single Sec codon, Sec1 might be expected to have the greatest readthrough because it has what is classically described as the weakest context for translation termination, i.e. a U as the fourth base (Fig. 1). Yet, based on our in vitro translation data, Sec1 provided lower readthrough than Sec4–Sec6, each of which has a stronger predicted context for termination with a C at the fourth base (Fig. 2A, compare lane 2 with lanes 5–7). In the absence of CTSBP2, several contexts provided virtually no readthrough including the Luc UGA control, Sec3, and Sec7–Sec10. Interestingly, significant differences in readthrough efficiency were observed among Sec3–Sec6, all of which share a C residue at the fourth base. Sec3 was ∼5-fold less efficient at readthrough than Sec6 and 8-fold less efficient than Sec4 and Sec5 (Fig. 2A compare lanes 4–7). The striking lack of readthrough for Sec7–Sec10 with endogenous SBP2 is likely due to the presence of dual UGA codons in each of these contexts. A graphical representation of the amount of readthrough supported by the Sel P UGA codon contexts is shown in Fig. 2C (white bars). Fig. 2, A and C, clearly show that the Sel P Sec codon contexts had readthrough efficiencies that did not correlate with the fourth base hierarchy for translation termination. These results, together with previous studies of the role of the fourth base in regulating Sec incorporation, confirm that the fourth base of a Sec codon context is not a good predictor of readthrough efficiency thus alluding to the involvement of either a larger codon context determinant, a role for the SECIS elements, or both. To analyze the differences in readthrough efficiency under conditions where Sec incorporation levels were increased, we supplemented the translation reactions with 0.2 pmol of CTSBP2, which is in the middle of the linear range of response for the in vitro Sec incorporation assay (data not shown). Under these conditions, there was a 3–16-fold increase in readthrough for most constructs (Fig. 2B) and a general reduction in the differences in readthrough efficiency between constructs (Fig. 2C, gray bars). The Luc UGA control appears to generate a higher level of full-length product, but the amount of termination product is consistently higher. The basis for this, as well as the fact that the pre-Sec peptide runs at a slightly lower apparent molecular weight, is unknown. With 0.2 pmol of CTSBP2, average readthrough of Sec1 rose from 3.1 to 10% (compare lane 2 in Fig. 2, A and B), whereas average readthrough for Sec3 rose almost 16-fold from 0.7 to 11% (compare lane 4 in Fig. 2, A and B). Sec4–Sec6, all of which had the highest average readthrough with endogenous SBP2, maintained their high readthrough profile in the presence of 0.2 pmol of CTSBP2. Average readthrough of Sec4 and Sec5 rose 3-fold from ∼5 to ∼15%, respectively, whereas average readthrough of Sec6 rose 4-fold from 3 to 13% (compare Fig. 2, A, lanes 5–7 to B, lanes 5–7). These data are shown graphically in Fig. 2C (gray bars). Interestingly, in the contexts that contained a single Sec codon, the differences in readthrough that existed in the presence of endogenous SBP2 or 0.2 pmol of CTSBP2 were eliminated with saturating levels of SBP2. When saturating levels of SBP2 (2 pmol of CTSBP2) were added to the reactions, readthrough was again substantially increased in the constructs containing a single in-frame Sec codon (Sec1–Sec6) but to a lesser extent in the dual UGA contexts (Sec7–Sec10). Fig. 2C (black bars) shows that with saturating amounts of SBP2, average readthrough reaches its peak with an efficiency of ∼20%, still below the maximum of 40% achieved with full-length Sel P in vitro (22Mehta A.

The contexts containing two Sec codons (Sec7–Sec10) yielded uniformly lower readthrough both in the presence and absence of CTSBP2 when compared with all other contexts (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 8–11). With saturating amounts of SBP2, readthrough of Sec7–Sec10 was still restricted to ∼7% (Fig. 2C, black bars). That excess SBP2 could not promote maximum Sec incorporation efficiency (∼20%; Fig. 2C, black bars) suggested that the decoding of dual UGA codons as Sec may require other cis-elements present in full-length Sel P. Sel P SECIS Elements Differentially Regulate Readthrough and Sec Incorporation—Because the addition of SBP2 to RRL reduced the differences in readthrough dictated by codon context, we set out to determine the specific contributions of readthrough resulting from Sec incorporation versus nonspecific readthrough (translational infidelity) using Sec1 and Sec5 as examples of low and high efficiency, respectively. As a control to test for UGA specificity, we mutated the Sec codon of Sec1 and Sec5 to the UAA stop codon. This nonsense mutation yielded no readthrough even in the presence of added SBP2 showing our readthrough was UGA-specific (data not shown). In addition, to assess the potential role of eEFsec in regulating Sec incorporation efficiency, Sec1 and Sec5 mRNAs were co-translated with 100 ng of eEFSec mRNA, which had no effect on readthrough (data not shown). This result was not unexpected because we have previously established that RRL is limiting only for SBP2 (22Mehta A. Rebsch C.M. Kinzy S.A. Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37852-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To create constructs that were unable to support Sec incorporation, both SECIS elements were mutated at the core region (AUGA to AUCC), a mutation that eliminates the 5′ side of the essential GA quartet and that prevents SBP2 binding and Sec incorporation for other SECIS elements (24Lesoon A. Mehta A. Singh R. Chisolm G.M. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1977-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 3N. Rodriguez and P. R. Copeland, unpublished results. Fig. 3A (lanes 4, 5, 9, and 10) shows the results of translating Sec1 and Sec5 mRNAs harboring double mutant SECIS elements (M1M2) with endogenous SBP2 or 0.2 pmol of CTSBP2. With endogenous SBP2, the double mutation in Sec5 decreased readthrough from ∼5 to ∼3% (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 3 and 5), indicating that the efficiency of Sec incorporation is only about 2% (Fig. 3C, white bars). In the case of Sec1, with endogenous SBP2, the double SECIS mutants reduced readthrough from ∼3 to ∼1% (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 2 and 4) thus indicating the same relative amount of Sec incorporation as found for Sec5 (Fig. 3C, white bars). As expected, the addition of 0.2 pmol of CTSBP2 had no stimulatory effect on readthrough for either Sec1 M1M2 or Sec5 M1M2 (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 4 and 5 to lanes 9 and 10). That Sec5 M1M2 retained significantly higher readthrough relative to Sec1 M1M2 indicates that most of the readthrough apparent for Sec5, in the absence of added SBP2, is the result of translation infidelity as opposed to Sec incorporation. Table 1 shows the amount of readthrough due to Sec incorporation for Sec1 and Sec5 calculated as the difference between readthrough observed with wild-type SECIS elements and that observed with the double SECIS mutants. These results reiterate that most of the readthrough obtained for Sec5 in the absence of added SBP2 is the result of translational infidelity. However, this activity is suppressed in the presence of saturating levels of SBP2, suggesting that when Sec incorporation is relatively efficient, it is able to suppress nonspecific readthrough of UGA codons.TABLE 1Absolute percentage of Sec incorporation of Sec1 and Sec5 (when translated with 0, 0.2, or 2 pmol of CTSBP2) as calculated by subtracting readthrough of their respective double SECIS mutants (Sec1-Sec1 M1M2 or Sec5-Sec5 M1M2)ConstructAbsolute % of Sec incorporation±S.E.Sec1; 0 pmol of CTSBP22.190.29Sec5; 0 pmol of CTSBP22.340.7Sec1; 0.2 pmol of CTSBP290.7Sec5; 0.2 pmol of CTSBP212.850.79Sec1; 2 pmol of CTSBP2190.97Sec5; 2 pmol of CTSBP2200.7 Open table in a new tab"
https://openalex.org/W2025681366,"Tumor suppressor p53 protein is the transcription factor responsible for various genes including DNA repair, growth arrest, apoptosis and antiangiogenesis. Recently, we showed that clathrin heavy chain (CHC), which was originally identified as a cytosolic protein regulating endocytosis, is present in nuclei and functions as a coactivator for p53. Here, we determined the detailed p53-binding site of CHC and a CHC deletion mutant containing this region (CHC833-1406) behaved as a monomer in cells. Monomeric CHC833-1406 still had a higher ability to transactivate p53 than wild-type CHC although this CHC mutant no longer had endocytic function. Moreover, similar to wild-type CHC, monomeric CHC enhances p53-mediated transcription through the recruitment of histone acetyltransferase p300. Immunofluorescent microscopic analysis exhibited that CHC833-1406 is predominantly localized in nuclei, suggesting that there may be a certain regulatory domain for nuclear export in the C-terminus of CHC. Thus, the trimerization domain of CHC is not necessary for the transactivation of p53 target genes and these data provide further evidence that nuclear CHC plays a role distinct from clathrin-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2079282593,"The two low affinity IgG Fc receptors (FcγR), FcγRIII and FcγRIIB, are coexpressed on myeloid effector cells, and their genes, as reported here, are positively and negatively regulated by both C5a and interferon-γ through different signaling mechanisms. Two 48- and 43-bp sequences (C5a-inductive region (CIR) and C5a-suppressive region (CSR)) in the FcγRIII and FcγRIIB 5′-flanking regions that are necessary for C5a induction and suppression, respectively, are defined. Sequence analysis of the CIR and CSR, which localize apart from the interferon-γ-responsive regions in each gene, revealed the presence of a novel element that differs by two nucleotides between FcγRIII and FcγRIIB. Mutation analysis of the CIR and CSR showed that this small difference determines inverse responsiveness in an FcγR gene context-dependent manner. Our study suggests that C5a uses similar DNA motifs (defined as GTGA<i>XX</i>TCCA) in both pathways of transcriptional induction and suppression of FcγRIII and FcγRIIB."

The overexpression of PLC-ϵ led to an increase in receptor recycling and decreased the down-regulation of the EGF receptor in COS-7 cells. Adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2) was identified as a novel binding protein that associates with the PLC-ϵ RA2 domain independently of Ras. The interaction of PLC-ϵ with AP2 was responsible for the suppression of EGF receptor down-regulation, since a perturbation in this interaction abolished this effect.

Growth factor receptors control a wide variety of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration. The ligand-induced activation of receptor tyrosine kinases leads to the assembly of signaling protein complexes and the subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways. The inappropriate activation and aberrant signaling of particular growth factor receptors have been associated with a number of diseases, including cancers. There are over 30 receptor tyrosine kinases tightly associated with cancer pathogenesis (1Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced receptor down-regulation plays a key role in the tight regulation of the intensity and duration of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to avoid aberrant cellular stimulation. Ligand-induced activation of receptors leads to the recruitment of the endocytic machinery and subsequently to endosomal sorting, which can result in lysosomal degradation of the receptor or in the recycling of the receptor back to the cell surface (2Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). The dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase down-regulation has recently been suggested as another potential cause of neoplastic growth. For example, alterations that uncouple receptor tyrosine kinases from c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and thereby from down-regulation are tightly associated with cancer pathogenesis (3Bache K.G. Slagsvold T. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2707-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, the aberrant expression or dysregulation of the machinery for the endocytosis or the lysosomal targeting of receptor tyrosine kinases is directly implicated in tumorigenesis.

Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Phospholipase C (PLC) is activated by various growth factors or G protein-coupled receptor ligands and hydrolyzes phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphate into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which are implicated in calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation, respectively (14Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). PLC-ϵ was identified to be a mammalian counterpart of PLC210, which was found to be a binding protein of LET-60, the nematode Ras (15Shibatohge M. Kariya K. Liao Y. Hu C.-D. Watari Y. Goshima M.

PLC-ϵ contains a CDC25 homology domain at its amino terminus and a pair of RA domains at the carboxyl terminus (16Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V.

These structural features suggest that PLC-ϵ is involved in the signaling promoted by the Ras superfamily GTPases. In fact, the RA domain of PLC-ϵ specifically binds to the activated Ras, or Rap1A, which is known to be an important step in the activation and subcellular localization of PLC-ϵ (17Song C. Hu C.D.

In this study, we suggest a novel function of PLC-ϵ that is independent of its PLC activity. PLC-ϵ suppressed the down-regulation of the EGF receptor through an RA domain-mediated interaction with AP2. The PLC-ϵ-dependent up-regulation of the EGF receptor led to an increase in EGF-induced cell growth, which provided evidence that the novel mechanism was an involvement in the mitogenic role of PLC-ϵ. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibody of PLC-ϵ was generated by immunizing CDC25 domain of PLC-ϵ obtained from Escherichia coli or obtained from Dr. Tohru Kataoka (Kobe University). Other antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-μ2 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), mouse monoclonal anti-α-adaptin antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), and rabbit polyclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgA, IgM, and IgG were from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum (BCS), antibiotics, and glutamine, and OVCAR-3 cells and immortalized MEF cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and glutamine. Cells were grown to ∼90% confluence for immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments or 50% confluence for immunofluorescence experiments. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—PLC-ϵ RA domains (amino acids 1990–2218) were cloned into the pLexA (BD Clontech) in frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain (referred to as pLexA-PLC-ϵ). The yeast strain, EGY48, carrying the reporter gene was cotransformed with the bait plasmid, pLexA-PLC-ϵ and a human HeLa cDNA library fused to the VP16 activation domain. Transformation was carried out using the lithium acetate method (20Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods K.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Leucine-positive colonies were identified by a filter-lifting assay for β-galactosidase activity. Library-derived DNA was prepared from candidate clones and analyzed by DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed with TGH buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with anti-HA, anti-FLAG, or anti-PLC-ϵ antibody-coupled Protein A-Sepharose for 3 h and then washed with TGH buffer three times. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. EGF Receptor Internalization Assay—After 24 h of serum starvation, cells were incubated with 1 ng/ml of 125I-labeled EGF for 5 min at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were washed rapidly three times with cold DMEM. The cells were then incubated for 5 min with 0.2 m acetic acid (pH 2.8) containing 0.5 m NaCl at 4 °C. The acid wash was combined with another short rinse in the same buffer, and used to determine the amount of surface-bound 125I-EGF. The cells were lysed in 1 m NaOH to determine the intracellular radioactivity. Internalized 125I-EGF was expressed as a percentage of the total (internalized and surface-bound). EGF Receptor Recycling Assay—After 24 h of serum starvation, cells were incubated with 125I-labeled EGF for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed with binding medium (1% bovine serum albumin in DMEM), and surface-bound EGF was removed by incubation with acidic solution (0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0) for 5 min two times. Cells were rinsed again and chased with binding medium containing 100 ng/ml cold EGF for 15 min. The medium and cells were collected after the incubation. Cells were harvested by scraping with 1 m NaOH. Proteins in the medium were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid, and cells (internalized EGF), medium pellet (recycled EGF), and medium supernatant (degraded EGF) were counted in a γ-counter. Each data point was collected in duplicate. Recycled 125I-EGF was expressed as a percentage of total (internalized, degraded, and recycled). Analysis of EGF Trafficking—After 24 h of serum starvation, cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated EGF for the indicated times. To inhibit EGF receptor recycling, cells were pretreated with 100 μm monensin for 30 min before the addition of 0.5 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated EGF for 30 min. After incubation, cells were washed, fixed, and stained for the indicated antibodies. Thymidine Incorporation Assay—Cells were seeded in triplicate into 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and were transfected with PLC-ϵ siRNA or control scrambled siRNA. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM for 24 h to reach quiescence. The cells were then incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml EGF for 18 h prior to the addition of [3H]thymidine for an additional 6 h. Thymidine incorporation was measured as previously reported (21Coward P. Wada H.G. Falk M.S. Chan S.D.H. Meng F. Akil H. Conklin B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent Labeling and Confocal Microscopy—COS-7 cells expressing FLAG-tagged PLC-ϵ were cultured on poly-l-lysine slides. After incubation with rhodamine-EGF, cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking with 1% horse serum in PBS, the cells were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody diluted in blocking solution for 3 h at room temperature. After extensive washing in PBS, the cells were incubated for an additional 1 h with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. To visualize recycled EGF receptors in the plasma membrane, we expressed EGFR-RFP in the presence or absence of PLC-ϵ in COS-7 cells. After incubation for 12 h, the cells transfected with EGFR-RFP alone were mixed with the cells transfected with both EGF receptor and PLC-ϵ. After serum starvation for 24 h, cells were either fixed or incubated with EGF for 15 min. After incubation of EGF, cells were either fixed or washed with cold PBS and acidic solution (0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0) and then chased for another 15 min at 37 °C to induce EGF receptor recycling. The fixed cells were stained for PLC-ϵ with anti-FLAG antibody. Cells were viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with LSM 510 version 2.02 software, an argon (458- and 488-nm) laser, and a helium/neon (543- and 633-nm) laser. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—FLAG-tagged mouse PLC-ϵ DNA was a generous gift from Dr. Tohru Kataoka (Kobe University). The lipase-inactive mutant of PLC-ϵ (referred to as PLC-ϵ LIM) was generated by substitution of His1142 with Leu. PLC-ϵ ΔCT was generated by PCR amplification of PLC-ϵ fragment containing amino acids 1–1988. For the construction of the AP2 binding-deficient mutant, KLKE (residues 2214–2217) sequence was changed into AAAA, or each amino acid in KLKE was changed into Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. Mouse μ2 DNA was kindly provided by Dr. Jacques H Camonis (Institut Curie) and introduced into pcDNA-HA vector by PCR amplification. EGFP-μ2 was a generous gift from Dr. Margarita Martin (University of Barcelona). Previously, the μ2 subunit tagged with EGFP (μ2-EGFP) was found to integrate into the endogenous AP2 complex by transient expression (22Del Valle J.M. Engel P. Martín M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17430-17437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The EGF receptor tagged with C-terminal RFP (EGFR-RFP) was previously described (23Matsuda M. Paterson H.F. Rodriguez R. Fensome A.C. Ellis M.V. Swann K. Katan M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For the inhibition of PLC-ϵ-AP2 interaction, oligonucleotides corresponding to binding region peptide (GKFILKLKEQVQ; 2211–2220) were synthesized and subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma). To generate siRNA-resistant mouse PLC-ϵ cDNA, 5′-TAT TCC TAC AGC-3′ was changed into 5′-TAC AGT TAT TCA-3′ using site-directed mutagenesis. Knockdown of PLC-ϵ and AP2—Synthetic siRNA against PLC-ϵ and control scrambled siRNA was introduced into OVCAR-3 or MEF cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). PLC-ϵ siRNA (GCCAAATATTCCTACAGCA) and control scrambled siRNA (ACTGTCACAAGTACCTACA) have been previously described (24Kelley G.G. Kaproth-Joslin K.A. Reks S.E. Smrcka A.V. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J.

These domains have been considered to be important regulatory modules for the specific function of PLC-ϵ; thus, the elucidation of protein complexes involving these domains may lead to a better understanding of the roles of PLC-ϵ. Given that the sequence conservation between RA domain family members is quite low, it has been suggested that the RA domains of PLC-ϵ may interact with other proteins rather than with members of the small GTPase superfamily (26Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We sought to identify binding partners of the PLC-ϵ RA domain and performed a yeast two-hybrid analysis using bait containing the serial RA1 and RA2 domain of PLC-ϵ. We screened ∼5 × 106 clones from a HeLa cell cDNA library. In total, five types of clones interacted specifically when tested for nutritional selection and β-galactosidase activity. Three of these clones were identified as the μ2 subunit of AP2. The cDNA encoded amino acids 160–385 of μ2. AP2 is a heterotetrameric complex that acts as an adaptor molecule during endocytosis (8Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We attempted to confirm the interaction between PLC-ϵ and AP2 using biochemical analysis (Fig. 1, A–C). As shown in Fig. 1A, immunoprecipitation of PLC-ϵ confirmed the interaction of endogenous AP2 with PLC-ϵ in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. In addition, Fig. 1B demonstrated that deletion of the C terminus containing the RA1 and RA2 domain of PLC-ϵ abolished this interaction; however, a lipase-inactive mutant showed the same affinity for AP2 in COS-7 cells. We performed in vitro binding analysis using purified PLC-ϵ RA domain and μ2 to examine whether interaction between PLC-ϵ and AP2 is direct or mediated by other proteins. As shown in Fig. 1C, GST pull-down analysis demonstrated that AP2 directly binds with the PLC-ϵ RA domain. We compared the intracellular localization of endogenous PLC-ϵ and AP2 in cells in order to provide additional evidence for an association between PLC-ϵ and AP2 (Fig. 1D). In a previous study, immunostaining analysis with the α-PLC-ϵ antibody showed strong perinuclear staining and a less pronounced distribution throughout the cytoplasm in various cells (27Sorli S.C. Bunney T.D. Sugden P.H. Paterson H.F. Katan M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We used the μ2 subunit tagged with EGFP (μ2-EGFP), which was found to integrate in the endogenous AP2 complex by transient expression (22Del Valle J.M. Engel P. Martín M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17430-17437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, PLC-ϵ was observed around the perinuclear area and cytoplasm, which is consistent with the previous finding. μ2 was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm as punctuate structures and also detected in the plasma membrane. Interestingly, PLC-ϵ was also detected at those punctuate structures around the perinuclear area and cell periphery. These results suggest that the association of the RA domain with the μ2 subunit induces the formation of the PLC-ϵ-AP2 complex in a PLC-ϵ lipase activity-independent manner. RA2 Domain of PLC-ϵ Binds with AP2 in a Ras-independent Manner—The RA domain of PLC-ϵ is composed of the RA1 and RA2 domains, which are homologous and structurally related to one another. However, the critical charged residues in the interface of the RA2 domain that would face Ras are not conserved in the RA1 domain; thus, the RA1 domain is unable to interact with Ras family proteins (28Bunney T.D. Harris R. Gandarillas N.L. Josephs M.B. Roe S.M. Sorli S.C. Paterson H.F. Rodrigues-Lima F. Esposito D. Ponting C.P. Gierschik P. Pearl L.H. Driscoll P.C. Katan M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We first tried to elucidate the binding region of the RA domain in order to determine the functional role of the interaction between PLC-ϵ and AP2 (Fig. 2, A and B). As shown in Fig. 2B, GST pull-down analysis revealed that the RA2 domain alone is responsible for the interaction with the μ2 subunit of AP2. We deleted either the N terminus or C terminus from the RA2 domain in an effort to further narrow down the binding region (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, the deletion of the N terminus of the RA2 domain had no effect on its interaction with AP2; however, the deletion of the C terminus abolished the interaction between AP2 and the RA2 domain. In particular, the deletion of the last four amino acids in the RA2 domain (KLKE; 2214–2217) was sufficient to abolish the interaction between AP2 and the RA2 domain. We then changed each amino acid or all four amino acids of KLKE into alanines and examined the interaction between PLC-ϵ and AP2. As shown in Fig. 2C, the E2217A and AAAA mutants did not co-immunoprecipitate with AP2 in the cells, which revealed that the glutamate residue of KLKE in the RA2 domain is essential to binding. Recent structural analysis revealed that the β1, β2, and the α1–α3 loop of the RA2 domain interact with switch I and switch II of Ras (28Bunney T.D. Harris R. Gandarillas N.L. Josephs M.B. Roe S.M. Sorli S.C. Paterson H.F. Rodrigues-Lima F. Esposito D. Ponting C.P. Gierschik P. Pearl L.H. Driscoll P.C. Katan M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The AP2 binding region is located at the end of β5. We examined whether Ras affects the interaction between AP2 and the RA2 domain (Fig. 2, D and E). As shown in Fig. 2D, we initially expressed constitutively active Ras (Ras V12) or a dominant negative mutant (Ras N17) of Ras in COS-7 cells and performed a pull-down analysis using GST-RA2 fusion proteins. The RA2 domain effectively associates with endogenous AP2 as well as with Ras, and co-incubation with Ras V12 did not change the association between the RA2 domain and AP2. Similarly, Fig. 2E shows that neither the constitutively active form nor the dominant negative form of Ras had an effect on the association between AP2 and PLC-ϵ in the cells. Overall, these results suggest that the RA2 domain of PLC-ϵ has a specific binding module that is utilized for the interaction with AP2 as well as that for Ras and that each interaction seems to be independent. PLC-ϵ Promotes the Recycling of EGF Receptor—AP2 is an important adaptor molecule that is involved in the endocytosis of cell surface receptors. This led us to investigate whether PLC-ϵ can affect the endocytosis of cell surface receptors. Among various receptors, we focused on EGF receptor endocytosis, since EGF stimulation induces the translocation of PLC-ϵ into plasma membrane and subsequent hydrolysis of PIP2 (17Song C. Hu C.D. Masago M. Kariyai K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2752-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To trace the endocytosis and trafficking of EGF receptors, COS-7 cells transfected with PLC-ϵ cDNA were incubated with rhodamine-EGF for various times at 37 °C (Fig. 3A). The α-FLAG antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody were used to detect the expression of FLAG-tagged PLC-ϵ. As shown in Fig. 3A (a–c), the initial uptake of rhodamine-EGF was not altered by the overexpression of PLC-ϵ. However, after a 30-min incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 3A, g–i), the amount of intracellular rhodamine-EGF was significantly decreased in the PLC-ϵ-transfected cells. We used monensin, a carboxylic ionophore that disrupts the recycling of internalized EGF receptors, to determine whether the reduced amount of EGF in PLC-ϵ-transfected cells was the result of enhanced EGF receptor recycling (Fig. 3A, j–l). Pretreatment with monensin restored the accumulation of rhodamine-EGF, which suggests the possibility that PLC-ϵ can promote the recycling of EGF receptors. We sought to measure the effects of PLC-ϵ on EGF receptor recycling. First, we examined whether PLC-ϵ affects the internalization of EGF receptors using 125I-EGF (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3A, EGF receptor internalization was not altered by PLC-ϵ overexpression. We then measured EGF receptor recycling by monitoring the trafficking of internalized 125I-EGF (Fig. 3C). The results indicated that the extrinsic expression of PLC-ϵ can lead to an increase in EGF receptor recycling to the cell surface. To further confirm the effects of PLC-ϵ on EGF receptor recycling, we expressed RFP-tagged EGF receptors with PLC-ϵ and tried to detect recycled EGF receptors on the plasma membrane (Fig. 3D). As shown in Fig. 3D (a–c), the EGF receptor was primarily localized in the plasma membrane before stimulation, and the incubation of EGF for 15 min led to the almost complete internalization of the EGF receptors in both PLC-ϵ-transfected cells and nontransfected cells (Fig. 3D, d–f). After removing EGF from the media, the cells were chased for another 15 min to induce EGF receptor recycling (Fig. 3D, g–i). EGF receptors located in the plasma membrane were prominently detected in PLC-ϵ-transfected cells compared with nontransfected cells, which supports the positive role of PLC-ϵ in EGF receptor recycling. We then examined whether endogenous PLC-ϵ is involved in EGF receptor recycling using the siRNA-mediated reduction of PLC-ϵ in cells (Fig. 3, E and G). Fig. 3E indicates that PLC-ϵ is specifically reduced by the PLC-ϵ siRNA without affecting the levels of other PLC isozyme, such as PLC-γ1 or PLC-β3, in OVCAR-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, F and G, the internalization of EGF receptor was not altered by PLC-ϵ knockdown, but recycling was significantly decreased by PLC-ϵ knockdown, which demonstrates that endogenous PLC-ϵ is involved in the enhancement of EGF receptor recycling. Taken together, these results suggest that PLC-ϵ can promote EGF receptor recycling. PLC-ϵ Suppresses EGF Receptor Degradation—Internalized receptors are delivered to early endosomes, which mature into multivesicular bodies, where EGF receptors undergo sorting to the plasma membrane for recycling or to the lysosome for destruction (2Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). We examined whether PLC-ϵ overexpression affected the degradation of EGF receptors (Fig. 4). Fig. 4A showed that following the addition of EGF to vector-transfected cells, total receptor levels as detected by Western blotting with an α-EGF receptor antibody were significantly reduced over a time period of 15–90 min. However, cells expressing PLC-ϵ showed a marked reduction in the rate of EGF receptor down-regulation. We examined whether PLC-ϵ affects the synthesis of EGF receptor after EGF stimulation, thus leading to the higher remaining EGF receptor levels in PLC-ϵ-transfected cells compared with vector-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, the blockade of protein synthesis by cycloheximide did not abolish the PLC-ϵ-dependent increase of remaining EGF receptor level after EGF stimulation, which suggests that PLC-ϵ is involved in the EGF receptor degradation pathway and not in the synthesis pathway. We then examined EGF receptor degradation in PLC-ϵ siRNA-transfected cells in order to investigate the role of endogenous PLC-ϵ (Fig. 4C). Consistent with results from the overexpression of PLC-ϵ, EGF receptor degradation was accelerated by PLC-ϵ knockdown. These results demonstrate that PLC-ϵ plays a negative role in EGF receptor degradation. The Interaction between PLC-ϵ and AP2 Is Responsible for the Decreased EGF Receptor Down-regulation—We investigated whether the PLC-ϵ-dependent suppression of EGF receptor down-regulation was the result of the binding between AP2 and PLC-ϵ (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5A, overexpression of wild type PLC-ϵ or a lipase-inactive mutant of PLC-ϵ led to increased EGF receptor recycling, but the expression of the PLC-ϵ E2217A mutant did not increase the recycling of the EGF receptor. Concomitantly, as shown in Fig. 5B, EGF receptor degradation was suppressed in cells transfected with wild type PLC-ϵ and the lipase-inactive mutant in comparison with cells transfected with a vector or with E2217A mutant. These results are consistent with the findings of the recycling experiments and suggest that PLC-ϵ affects EGF receptor down-regulation by interacting with AP2 and that PLC activity is not required for this process. We attempted to block the interaction between endogenous proteins in order to further confirm the importance of the AP2-PLC-ϵ interaction in the regulation of EGF receptor trafficking (Fig. 5, C and D). To block the binding between PLC-ϵ and AP2, we constructed a fusion construct encompassing 10 amino acids (2211–2220) in the AP2-binding region of the RA domain. Fig. 5C demonstrates that transfection of this construct in COS7 cells effectively inhibited the interaction between PLC-ϵ and AP2 (bottom). Furthermore, this construct suppressed EGF receptor recycling (top). In addition, as shown in Fig. 5D, EGF receptor degradation was facilitated by the expression of this construct. These results further support the conclusion that the PLC-ϵ-mediated regulation of EGF receptor down-regulation is dependent on the interaction between PLC-ϵ and AP2. We then investigated whether knockdown of AP2 affects PLC-ϵ-dependent promotion of EGF receptor recycling. μ2 siRNA effectively reduced AP2 level in MEF cells (Fig. 5E). As shown in Fig. 5F, knockdown of μ2 subunit increased EGF receptor recycling. Furthermore, the PLC-ϵ-dependent increase of EGF receptor recycling was abolished by AP2 knockdown. The results confirmed that AP2 is involved in PLC-ϵ-dependent regulation of EGF receptor recycling. PLC-ϵ Promotes EGF-dependent Thymidine Incorporation by Up-regulating the EGF Receptor—The enhanced recycling of EGF receptors can reportedly lead to increased EGF-dependent proliferation (29Tran D.D. Russell H.R. Sutor S.L. van Deursen J. Bram R.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Palmieri D. Bouadis A. Ronchetti R. Merino M.J. Steeg P.S. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2006; 100: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We investigated whether PLC-ϵ overexpression promotes EGF-dependent thymidine incorporation by increasing EGF receptor recycling (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6A, the expression of wild type PLC-ϵ or a lipase-inactive mutant of PLC-ϵ significantly increased the EGF-dependent thymidine incorporation of COS-7 cells; however, the E2217A mutant had no effect. These results suggest that PLC-ϵ is capable of promoting EGF-dependent cell growth by an RA domain-mediated interaction with AP2. We then examined whether PLC-ϵ knockdown led to the suppression of EGF-dependent thymidine incorporation. Fig. 6B indicates that PLC-ϵ knockdown in MEF cells led to a significant inhibition of EGF-induced thymidine incorporation, which is recovered by the add-back of PLC-ϵ construct, which is resistant to the PLC-ϵ siRNA. In all, these results corroborate the contribution of PLC-ϵ in growth factor-dependent cell growth. Thus far, the RA domain of PLC-ϵ was considered to be a binding module for Ras family G-proteins, and it was thought to play an important role in the activation of PLC-ϵ (17Song C. Hu C.D. Masago M.

However, our yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that this domain interacts with various binding proteins as well as with Ras family proteins. Among the novel binding partners of the RA2 domain of PLC-ϵ, AP2 plays a key role in the PLC-ϵ-dependent regulation of the EGF receptor. Although both AP2 and Ras utilized the RA2 domain as a binding region for PLC-ϵ, the binding of AP2 with the RA2 domain was not affected by Ras, and vice versa. The reported NMR and x-ray crystallography analyses indicate that the AP2 binding region of RA2 corresponds to the end of the β5 sheet, which is separate from the interaction surface for switch I or switch II of Ras (28Bunney T.D. Harris R. Gandarillas N.L. Josephs M.B. Roe S.M. Sorli S.C. Paterson H.F. Rodrigues-Lima F. Esposito D. Ponting C.P. Gierschik P. Pearl L.H. Driscoll P.C. Katan M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, EGF receptor down-regulation was suppressed in cells transfected with the Ras-binding deficient mutant of PLC-ϵ (K2151E/K2153E) (data not shown). We speculate that the RA2 domain of PLC-ϵ can mediate novel binding in a manner independent of Ras family proteins and that it may be involved in the novel function of PLC-ϵ. There have been several reports on the role of PLC-ϵ in cell growth. PLC-ϵ was shown to induce platelet-derived growth factor-dependent cell growth in BaF3 cells expressing a platelet-derived growth factor receptor mutant that was incapable of activating PLC-γ (31Song C. Satoh T. Edamatsu H. Wu D. Tadano M. Gao X. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8105-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Carcinogen-induced skin tumor formation was also reduced in PLC-ϵ knock-out mice, which suggests a mitogenic function of PLC-ϵ (32Bai Y. Edamatsu H. Maeda S. Saito H. Suzuki N. Satoh T. Kataoka T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8808-8810Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast, SW480 cells derived from colorectal tumors microinjected with PLC-ϵ DNA showed a reduction in cell proliferation and an increase in cell death (27Sorli S.C. Bunney T.D. Sugden P.H. Paterson H.F. Katan M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our results support the mitogenic function of PLC-ϵ, since the expression of PLC-ϵ elicits EGF-dependent cell growth, and a reduction in PLC-ϵ expression in several cancer cells led to a reduction in cell growth. However, the mechanism underlying PLC-ϵ-dependent cell growth elucidated in this study is different from those of previous reports, suggesting that small G-protein-dependent PLC-ϵ activity is critical for cell growth or tumor formation (31Song C. Satoh T. Edamatsu H. Wu D. Tadano M. Gao X. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8105-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32Bai Y. Edamatsu H. Maeda S. Saito H. Suzuki N. Satoh T. Kataoka T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8808-8810Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that PLC-ϵ increased EGF receptor recycling, which enhanced the receptor-mediated cell growth. The lipase activity of PLC-ϵ was dispensable for this process. Recent studies have established that the enhanced recycling of surface receptors effectively leads to augmented ligand-induced proliferation by continuously replenishing the surface receptor levels necessary for prolonged signaling (29Tran D.D. Russell H.R. Sutor S.L. van Deursen J. Bram R.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Palmieri D. Bouadis A. Ronchetti R. Merino M.J. Steeg P.S. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2006; 100: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells with growth factors induces the activation of both PLC-γ1 and PLC-ϵ, but the isozyme-specific functions remain elusive (33Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Our analysis revealed that both PLC-γ1 and PLC-ϵ are involved in different stages of EGF receptor down-regulation. We previously determined that PLC-γ1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for dynamin-1 and that it is important for the internalization of the EGF receptor (34Choi J.H. Park J.B. Bae S.S. Yun S. Kim H.S. Hong W.P. Kim I.S. Kim J.H. Han M.Y. Ryu S.H. Patterson R.L. Snyder S.H. Suh P.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3785-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PLC-ϵ altered the endosomal trafficking of EGF receptors and enhanced receptor recycling. PLC-ϵ effectively inhibits EGF receptor down-regulation in PLC-γ1 knock-out cells, which implies that PLC-ϵ regulates EGF receptor trafficking independent of PLC-γ1 (Supplemental Fig. 1). Both PLC-γ1 and PLC-ϵ seem to promote mitogenic signaling via different underlying mechanisms. Although PLC-γ1 activates endosomal Erk and downstream signaling, PLC-ϵ blocks the termination of EGF receptor signaling, leading to cell growth. Previous reports have suggested that AP2 can be detected in early endosomes and that the EGF receptor-AP2 interaction may persist after the internalization of the receptor (35Sorkina T. Bild A. Tebar F. Sorkin A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 317-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Beck et al. (36Beck K.A. Chang M. Brodsky F.M. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) suggested the possible role of AP2 in endosome formation through their in vitro vesicle aggregation experiments. Furthermore, the L1010A/L1011A EGF receptor mutant, which is incapable of associating with AP2, showed a reduction in EGF-induced degradation, although its internalization rate was unchanged (37Huang F. Jiang X. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43411-43417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Also, our analysis revealed that knockdown of endogenous AP2 increased the EGF receptor recycling in MEF cells (Fig. 5F). Taken together, these results suggest that AP2 can promote the endosomal trafficking of the EGF receptor to degradative pathways. PLC-ϵ seems to associate with the AP2 on endocytic vesicles and thereby negatively regulate the function of AP2 in EGF receptor trafficking to degradative pathways. The interaction between PLC-ϵ and AP2 is induced by EGF stimulation (Supplemental Fig. 2), and this suggests that PLC-ϵ is recruited into AP2 engaged in EGF receptor trafficking. The fact that the μ2 subunit of AP2 is responsible for the interaction with EGF receptor suggests that PLC-ϵ may inhibit the EGF receptor-AP2 interaction. The detailed mechanism underlying the PLC-ϵ-dependent regulation of EGF receptor trafficking remains to be revealed. The results of our study demonstrate that PLC-ϵ promotes growth factor-dependent cell growth. They also provide evidence for a novel function of PLC-ϵ in the up-regulation of growth factor receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2048677712,"The propensity of proteins to form β-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils is related to a variety of biological phenomena, including a number of human neurodegenerative diseases and prions. A subset of amyloidogenic proteins forms amyloid fibrils through glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich domains, such as pathogenic polyglutamine (poly(Q)) proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease, as well as yeast prions. In the former, the propensity of an expanded poly(Q) tract to abnormally fold confers toxicity on the respective protein, leading to neuronal dysfunction. In the latter, Q/N-rich prion domains mediate protein aggregation important for epigenetic regulation. Here, we investigated the relationship between the pathogenic ataxin-3 protein of the human disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) and the yeast prion Sup35, using Drosophila as a model system. We found that the capacity of the Sup35 prion domain to mediate protein aggregation is conserved in Drosophila. Although select yeast prions enhance poly(Q) toxicity in yeast, the Sup35N prion domain suppressed poly(Q) toxicity in the fly. Suppression required the oligopeptide repeat of the Sup35N prion domain, which is critical for prion properties in yeast.

In the former, an expanded poly(Q) tract confers toxic gain-of-function properties on the host protein, leading to neuronal dysfunction (1Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 2Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The intrinsic propensity for expanded poly(Q) proteins to misfold is thought to underlie poly(Q) pathogenesis (3Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Wanker E.E. Amzel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the latter situation with yeast, the Q/N-rich domains are critical for prion states, which are characterized by the capacity of the prion protein to pass on dominant, epigenetic effects through changes in protein conformation (4Chien P. Weissman J.S. DePace A.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 5Shorter J. Lindquist S. Nat. Rev.

The prion state of Sup35 (referred to as [PSI+]), one of the best-studied yeast prions, is characterized by aggregation of the protein which causes protein inactivation and a dominant nonsense suppression effect. [PSI+] is tightly correlated with select Sup35 conformations that can be detected as amyloid-like structures (7Glover J.R. Kowal A.S. Schirmer E.C. Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Lindquist S. Cell. 1997; 89: 811-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 8Paushkin S.V. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Science. 1997; 277: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). That is, similar to the pathogenic activities of expanded poly(Q) proteins, Sup35 prion states depend on changes of protein conformation.Unlike the glutamine tract of expanded poly(Q) disease proteins, the Q/N-rich region of yeast prion domains is interspersed with other amino acids. However, pathogenic poly(Q) proteins and yeast prions are thought to aggregate through similar mechanisms. For example, studies in vitro suggest that hydrogen bonds formed between Q/Q or Q/N side chains can stabilize β-sheet conformations of the protein (9Gsponer J. Haberthur U. Caflisch A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5154-5159Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 10Perutz M.F. Pope B.J. Owen D. Wanker E.E. Scherzinger E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), indicating that poly(Q) tracts and Q/N-rich prion domains may function as conserved motifs to mediate protein-protein interactions. In support of this hypothesis, studies have shown that a pure poly(Q) domain can replace the Q/N-rich region (amino acids 1–40) of the Sup35N prion domain without altering its prion capacity (11DePace A.H. Santoso A. Hillner P. Weissman J.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 1241-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 12Osherovich L.Z. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Weissman J.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E86Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, pathogenic activities of poly(Q) proteins and the activities of yeast prions are both modulated by molecular chaperones (13Bonini N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16407-16411Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 14Jones G.W. Tuite M.F. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S.

These findings suggest that poly(Q) aggregates and yeast prion aggregates may share mechanisms and be modulated by common cellular pathways. Indeed, studies have shown that yeast prions and pathogenic poly(Q) proteins each promote the aggregation of the other in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (16Derkatch I.L. Uptain S.M. Outeiro T.F.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that interactions may occur between protein accumulations formed by poly(Q) proteins and prions.To examine potential physiological effects of a yeast prion domain on poly(Q) toxicity in the organism in vivo, we investigated interactions between pathogenic poly(Q) protein and the yeast prion domain Sup35N in Drosophila. Our findings suggest that Sup35 prion aggregation is conserved in the cellular environment of Drosophila and implicate a trans effect of the Sup35 prion conformation on the toxicity of pathogenic poly(Q) protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructs—Sup35N was amplified from yeast genomic DNA by PCR with primers: forward, 5′-CCGGCCGAATTCTCGACATGTCGGATTCAAACCA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGGCCAGATCTCACTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAACCTCCCATACCTTGAGAC-3′. A hemagglutinin (HA) tag was added to the C terminus of Sup35N peptide by PCR. Constructs for S2 cell culture were as follows. Sup35N-YFP was generated by replacing NM (nucleotides 1–759) of the construct p425CpSUPeYFP (yellow fluorescent protein; gift from J. Weissman) with Sup35N (nucleotides 1–369) between restriction enzyme sites SacI and BglII and then subcloned into the fly cell culture vector pRmHa-3 (gift from R. Fehon). The Sup35N region was amplified from p425CpSUPeYFP with primers: forward, 5′-CCGGCCGAGCTCACAATGTCGGATTCAAA-CCA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGGCCAGATCTCATACCTTGAGAC-3′.Sup35M-YFP and Sup35NRΔ-YFP were then generated by replacing the Sup35N region of Sup35N-YFP with Sup35M (nucleotides 370–759) and Sup35NRΔ region, respectively, which were amplified from constructs p425CpSUPeYFP and p316RΔ2–5-GFPSG (gift from S. Lindquist) (21Liu J.J. Lindquist S. Nature. 1999; 400: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) by PCR with primers: forward, 5′-CCGGCCGTCGACACAATGTCTTGAACGAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGGCCAGATCTATCGTTAACAAC-3′. SCA3trQ60-DsRed was generated by replacing the MJDQ20 region of the construct MJDQ20-GFP (gift from J. Weissman) (20Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2001; 106: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) with SCA3trQ60 cDNA amplified from the fly line bearing UAS-SCA3trQ60 (22Chan H.Y. Warrick J.M. Gray-Board G.L. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The GFP tag was replaced by DsRed2 (Clontech) between restriction enzyme sites BglII and SacI. The New-CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) construct was a gift from J. Weissman (20Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2001; 106: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).Fly Lines—General fly lines were from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. Flies were grown at 25 °C on standard medium unless otherwise indicated. SCA3Q84 fly lines are described (23Warrick J.M. Morabito L.M. Bilen J. Gordesky-Gold B. Faust L.Z. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For generating new transgenic lines, appropriate constructs described above were subcloned into the pUAST transformation vector, and transformant lines were generated by standard procedures using w1118 as the parental line, with mapping and balancing following standard procedures.S2 Cell Culture—Fly S2 cells were maintained on Schneider's medium (Sigma) at room temperature. S2 cells were transfected according to standard calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method, using 6 μg of total DNA. In transfections with a single construct, empty vector of pRmHa-3 was used to bring the total amount of DNA to 6 μg. 40 h after transfection, transient expression was induced by adding 0.7 m CuSO4 to a final concentration of 0.7 mm. Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy at time points indicated for each experiment (Leica DMRBE microscope), and only cells with fluorescence were counted as transfected.Serial Extraction Assay—40 fly heads were homogenized in 100 μl of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,175 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1:20 dilution of protease inhibitor (P8340; Sigma)). 50 μl of the above solution were analyzed by Western immunoblot as total protein. 50 μl was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was then collected as Tris-HCl soluble fraction, whereas the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 5% SDS TBS and re-centrifuged with the same conditions. The supernatant was collected as the SDS soluble fraction, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 8 m urea, 5% SDS TBS. All the fractions mentioned above were mixed with equal amount of 2× SDS sample buffer (Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad), with 1:20 β-mercaptoethanol) before loading onto Tris-HCl pre-cast 12.5% gels (Bio-Rad) to analyze by Western immunoblot.Immunohistochemistry and Western Analysis—Immunohistochemistry was performed on cryostat tissue as described (23Warrick J.M.

Primary antibodies included anti-HA (1:50, Y-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Myc (1:50, 9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit) were coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (1:100; Molecular Probes). Chromatin was stained with Hoechst (1 μg/ml). For Western immunoblots, primary antibodies included anti-HA (1:500, 3F10 rat-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, Roche Applied Science), anti-Myc (1:500, 9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-tubulin (1:10,000, mouse monoclonal; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). Secondary antibodies included horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:4000; Chemicon).RESULTSThe Sup35N Prion Domain Forms Aggregates and Is Recruited into Poly(Q) Inclusions in Drosophila S2 Cells—The yeast protein Sup35 has three distinctive domains (24Uptain S.M. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 703-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region (amino acids 1–124), termed Sup35N, is the prion domain that is necessary and sufficient for prion activity of Sup35. The C-terminal region (amino acids 253–685) is the functional domain with translation-termination activity. The middle (M) region (amino acids 125–252) can modulate the solubility of the protein. In yeast, the prion states of Sup35N are reflected by the formation of fluorescent foci: Sup35NM-GFP fusion protein forms foci in yeast cells with prion proteins in prion states and remains soluble in yeast cells with prion proteins in nonprion states (21Liu J.J.

Weissman J.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 1241-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), such as deletion of the second through fifth R2–5 PQGGYQQYN oligopeptide repeats, result in loss of Sup35NM-GFP fluorescent foci (12Osherovich L.Z.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6683-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Sup35N can mediate foci formation related to its prion state in Drosophila, we made a series of Sup35N-YFP fusion proteins, including Sup35N (wild type) and Sup35NRΔ (deleted for the R2–5 repeats) (Fig. 1A) and expressed the constructs in Drosophila S2 cells.Sup35N-YFP formed fluorescent foci in 28 ± 15% of transfected S2 cells, which is similar to the reported percentage of Sup35N-GFP foci in yeast cells (15 ± 8.4%) (27Zhou P. Derkatch I.L. Liebman S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, Sup35N-YFP foci in S2 cells required the R2–5-repeat region, as Sup35M-YFP and Sup35NRΔ-YFP remained evenly distributed in all transfected cells over time (Fig. 1, B and C). These results suggested that the capacity of Sup35N to undergo foci formation is conserved in Drosophila S2 cells.To further examine whether Sup35N showed characteristics reminiscent of prion states, we investigated potential interactions between Sup35N and poly(Q) protein. Studies indicate that yeast prions promote the aggregation of and, in some cases, colocalize to poly(Q) proteins in yeast (17Duennwald M.L. Jagadish S. Giorgini F. Muchowski P.J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11051-11056Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J.

Cell. 2001; 106: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The prion state of Sup35 in particular has been shown to promote poly(Q) toxicity in yeast (18Gokhale K.C. Newnam G.P. Sherman M.Y. Chernoff Y.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22809-22818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether Sup35N affected poly(Q) inclusion formation in S2 cells. To do this, we made ataxin-3-DsRed fusion proteins (SCA3tr, a truncated form that reflects the disease situation) (30Goti D. Katzen S.M. Mez J. Kurtis N. Kiluk J. Ben-Haiem L. Jenkins N.A.

When Sup35N was coexpressed with Q60, Sup35N was recruited to poly(Q) inclusions in all transfected cells (Fig. 2B, and data not shown); however, the Sup35N expression pattern was not altered with coexpression of Q22 (Fig. 2C). This suggested that Sup35N selectively interacted with the pathogenic-length poly(Q) protein.FIGURE 2Sup35N is recruited to poly(Q) inclusions in Drosophila S2 cells. A, ataxin-3-DsRed fusion protein forms poly(Q) length-dependent inclusions in S2 cells. 100% of cells transfected with SCA3trQ60 (Q60) have fluorescent foci by 48 h after transfection, whereas SCA3trQ22 (Q22) remains soluble. B, Sup35N makes foci (green), and colocalizes into Q60 inclusions (red) when the two are cotransfected. C, distribution of the non-pathogenic Q22 (red) protein and Sup35N (green) is not affected upon coexpression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether the colocalization of Sup35N to Q60 inclusions was specific to the prion domain, we coexpressed Q60 with Sup35NRΔ and Sup35M. These data showed that Sup35NRΔ was also recruited to Q60 inclusions (Fig. 3B), whereas Sup35M was not (Fig. 3C). We further examined whether colocalization of Sup35N and Q60 was a general result of coexpressing any two proteins that form foci in S2 cells by expressing another prion domain from the New1p protein (New-CFP fusion protein) (20Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2001; 106: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, coexpression of Sup35N or Q60 with New1p did not result in colocalization to the same foci (Fig. 3, D and E). We confirmed that the effects of Q60 on Sup35N foci did not depend on DsRed because Q60-CFP protein showed colocalization similar to Q60-DsRed (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggested a specific interaction between Sup35N and the pathogenic ataxin-3 protein.FIGURE 3Interactions of ataxin-3, Sup35 domains, and New in Drosophila S2 cells.

Transgenic fly lines were generated that expressed Sup35N or Sup35NRΔ with an HA tag. Because the Sup35 prion domain has an intrinsic propensity to form amyloid-like aggregates (7Glover J.R.

Scherzinger E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we first examined whether this characteristic of Sup35N was conserved in the fly. Biochemical analysis revealed that when expressed in the eye photoreceptor neurons and associated cells with gmr-GAL4, both Sup35N and Sup35NRΔ proteins could be dissociated by SDS and detected as monomers at day 2, but formed SDS-insoluble complexes by day 23 (Fig. 4A). As a control, GFP remained monomeric in 23-day flies (Fig. 4A). This indicated that the Sup35N prion domain undergoes age-dependent protein complex formation in the fly.FIGURE 4Sup35N forms SDS-insoluble accumulations in Drosophila. A, Western immunoblot of flies expressing GFP, Sup35N, and Sup35NRΔ at day 2 and day 23. Sup35N and Sup35NRΔ (* marks protein at day 2) form age-dependent complexes at day 23 (bracket, high molecular weight complexes).

C, at day 2, the majority of Sup35N is in the SDS-insoluble pellet but is able to be dissociated to the monomeric form by urea (Fraction 3, arrowhead). At day 23, high molecular weight complexes of Sup35N are present, which are unable to be fully dissociated to monomeric protein by urea (Fraction 3, bracket). Genotype: gmr-GAL4/UAS-Sup35N. D, the Sup35NRΔ protein, like Sup35N (see panel C), forms protein complexes unable to be fully dissociated to a monomeric form by urea (Fraction 3, bracket) by day 23 when expressed in the fly eye. Genotype gmr-GAL4/+; UAS-Sup35NRΔ/+. E, the control protein GFP remains primarily Tris-HCl-soluble (Fraction 1) when expressed over time (23 days) in the fly eye. Genotype gmr-GAL4/UAS-EGFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In yeast, the prion conformation of Sup35 forms insoluble pellets, but the nonprion conformation remains in the salt-soluble supernatant upon centrifugation (8Paushkin S.V. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Science. 1997; 277: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). We therefore used a serial extraction assay to determine the solubility of Sup35N in the fly (Fig. 4B). These studies showed that the SDS-insoluble Sup35N complexes in 23-day flies were also unable to be dissociated to monomeric protein by urea (Fig. 4C). Moreover, although at day 2 Sup35N protein could be dissociated by SDS, it partitioned to the SDS-insoluble pellet upon high-speed centrifugation, suggesting that Sup35N may form intermediate aggregates that became enriched by centrifugation (Fig. 4C). These properties were similar to Sup35NRΔ (Fig. 4D). In contrast, the GFP control protein remained Tris-HCl-soluble (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these results suggested that the ability of Sup35N to undergo prion-like protein aggregation is conserved in the fly, but is not affected by the R2–5 repeats (see “Discussion”).Because abnormal protein accumulation and misfolding is associated in many human diseases, we next examined whether Sup35N caused abnormalities when expressed in flies. Immunohistochemistry revealed irregular inclusions formed by both Sup35N and Sup35NRΔ in 23-day flies (Fig. 5, G–I), consistent with the results of biochemical analysis. However, such accumulations did not affect the morphology of the eye externally or internally compared with controls (Fig. 5, A–F). We also examined the effects of Sup35N when expressed in a variety of additional tissues; no obvious abnormalities were found (Fig. 5, J–L). Thus, although Sup35N formed SDS-insoluble aggregates resembling those of pathogenic poly(Q) protein, the Sup35N prion domain did not cause obvious deleterious effects in the fly.FIGURE 5Expression of Sup35N in Drosophila does not cause obvious effects.

https://openalex.org/W2004692242,"Identification of visual field loss in people with retinal disease is not straightforward as people with eye disease are frequently unaware of substantial deficits in their visual field, as a consequence of perceptual completion (""filling-in"") of affected areas.We attempted to induce a compelling visual illusion known as the induced twinkle after-effect (TwAE) in eight patients with retinal scotomas. Half of these patients experience filling-in of their scotomas such that they are unaware of the presence of their scotoma, and conventional campimetric techniques can not be used to identify their vision loss. The region of the TwAE was compared to microperimetry maps of the retinal lesion.Six of our eight participants experienced the TwAE. This effect occurred in three of the four people who filled-in their scotoma. The boundary of the TwAE showed good agreement with the boundary of lesion, as determined by microperimetry.For the first time, we have determined vision loss by asking patients to report the presence of an illusory percept in blind areas, rather than the absence of a real stimulus. This illusory technique is quick, accurate and not subject to the effects of filling-in."

Here, we utilize representational difference analysis to identify the transcripts that are up-regulated in the presymptomatic stage of SOD1(G93A) mice. Unexpectedly, three predominant clones were 18S or 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) segments. One of these clones corresponded to a capped and polyadenylated transcript containing a large portion of 18S rRNA, named MSUR1 (mutant SOD1-up-regulated RNA 1). In vitro expression experiments show that MSUR1 is able to rescue SOD1(G93A)-mediated cell death. Expression of MSUR1 significantly reduces SOD1(G93A)-induced free radical levels and oxidative damage. Further, MSUR1 can reduce hydrogen peroxide-mediated cytotoxicity. MSUR1 does not encode a protein, suggesting its role as a functional noncoding RNA. It is widely expressed in various tissues. Searching the database of GenBank revealed that a large number of expressed sequence tag (EST) clones contain large portions of rRNA sequence, potentially indicating a heretofore overlooked class of mRNAs with functional significance."
https://openalex.org/W2095421959,"The current emphasis on translational research is starting to blur differences between research environments in academia and industry. This has opened up a two-way street for academic researchers to go to work in industry and, in some cases, to then return to academia. The current emphasis on translational research is starting to blur differences between research environments in academia and industry. This has opened up a two-way street for academic researchers to go to work in industry and, in some cases, to then return to academia. Earlier this year, cell biologist Ira Mellman traded a house on five acres and a tenured position at Yale University for the ups-and-downs of city living in San Francisco and a job at Genentech. This might seem a surprising move for someone so entrenched in academia, but Mellman follows in the footsteps of other well-known scientists who have made the jump to industry, notably Philip Needleman, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, Roger Perlmutter, Dennis Choi, and Roy Vagelos, among others. Going from academia to industry (and less commonly, the other way) is nothing new, of course. But a squeeze in funding for academic laboratories, the creation of quasi-university-like research organizations by big pharma, and PhD and postdoctoral students educated in an environment where applied research is more common have contributed to lowering the barrier to making the switch. According to Charlene Ledbetter of LedbetterStevens, a life sciences executive search firm in New York, “10 to 30 percent more senior roles [in industry] are being filled by academics than 10 years ago.” These, says Ledbetter, are senior scientists with tenure moving into top positions at biopharma companies. At the same time, research institutions funded by big pharma—such as Merck's department of experimental medicine in Rahway, New Jersey and the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) in San Diego—are forming a bridge between research in academia and industry. GNF, for example, strives to combine for-profit resources with hiring from academia, a relatively flat personnel structure, and encouragement to publish, says Peter Schultz, GNF's director and a faculty member at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. “The dividing lines between industry and academia have become progressively more porous,” says Dennis Choi, executive director of the Comprehensive Neuroscience Initiative at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. “There's a blurring of those careers,” making it not only more accepted to go from academia to industry, but also back again, he says. Choi has already been down this two-way street. Before taking up his post at Emory two months ago and after a stint at Boston University as a professor of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics, Choi had been executive vice president for neuroscience at Merck Research Laboratories in West Point, Pennsylvania for five years. Prior to joining industry, he was head of the neurology department at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis and was director of the McDonnell Center for Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology. “My time in industry was regarded as an asset” by academic recruiters, says Choi. “My direct understanding and appreciation of what is required in development of drugs is viewed as helpful by my colleagues.” “In the Bay Area, it is totally culturally acceptable to go from academia to biopharma and back. It's quite normal, actually, lots of people do both,” says Frank McCormick, director of the University of California, San Francisco Comprehensive Cancer Center and Cancer Research Institute and a professor in the department of microbiology and immunology. McCormick himself embodies that path, having previously served as the chief scientific officer of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, which he founded, and as vice president for research at both Chiron Corporation and Cetus. “The quality of science is so high [in both academia and industry] that one's peers recognize it as perfectly acceptable to do,” says McCormick. Patrick Griffin, chair of molecular therapeutics and director of translational research at Scripps Florida (a division of The Scripps Research Institute), agrees. “I think it's not a clear distinction between academic and for-profit at Scripps,” he says. There is a “need for good communications skills and leadership, you have to be doing cutting edge science in all cases.” Originally, he made the decision to leave academia after getting his doctorate at the University of Virginia working in proteomics. I was “thinking I wasn't cut out for academia. My impression was you spent a lot of time writing grants and papers, not enough time in the lab.” He first went to Genentech; “I was a scientist, a real live job, but the salary and cost of living in South San Francisco were not compatible.” He then switched to the California Institute of Technology to work on mass spectrometry systems biology with Lee Hood. That led to a collaboration and eventually a full-time job with Merck in their immunology division. “When I left to go from Harvard to Millennium, enough people questioned my sanity, I was a Howard Hughes investigator at Harvard, why would I leave that?” says Geoffrey Duyk, now a San Francisco-based healthcare investor and partner in the investment firm TPG (formerly the Texas Pacific Group). “Access to genomics tools was an uphill battle at Harvard at that moment in time” in the early ‘90s, he says. “The private sector was willing to invest, I went for the tools.” Duyk, an MD/PhD, in addition to being on the founding scientific staff of Millennium Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, MA has since served as president of research and development at Exelixis in South San Francisco. “I've been able to move between these communities and act as a peer. I'm more of an entrepreneurial scientist than anything else,” says Duyk. Patrick Vallance, now head of drug discovery at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in London, UK, was formerly chief of the department of medicine at University College London and was tapped for an industry position after serving on GSK's research advisory board for two years. He acknowledges that some academics consider a move to industry as selling out, but he says that is changing. And he has been “incredibly invigorated, ideas I haven't thought about for a long time” are bubbling to the surface. It has taken “me right outside my comfort zone, gave me a buzz that once again I would be challenged.” For all the movement back and forth between academia and industry, there remain significant differences between the two environments and in the kind of people who thrive in one place or the other. “If we went back and looked at top people's CVs, people who lead R&D commercial organizations, what would be their biomarkers?” asks Charlene Ledbetter of LedbetterStevens. Her answer: “Howard Hughes investigators, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, other key scientific awards, a willingness to learn, and the ability to build teams rather than be a sole contributor.” Choi echoes the importance of being a team player “You basically think more in terms of ‘we,’ you redefine ego to encompass team, you can only succeed in industry as a team,” he says. And, say people who have successfully made the transition, academics joining pharma need to tuck away their egos. “It's very easy to believe, if you're a success in anything, that you can develop a drug by the metric ton instead of micrograms at a lab bench,” says Joseph Miletich, senior vice president of research and development at Amgen in Thousand Oaks, California. “But unless you actually work at it for a while, you don't understand how complicated it is, no matter where you come from. If you can't sit in a room and admit to someone else that they know more than you, you aren't going to make it” in industry, says Miletich, who was also senior vice president for worldwide preclinical development at Merck as well as chief of the division of laboratory medicine at Washington University Medical School. Whether you are a researcher in academia connected with translational research or “a doctor in a medical center and then go over to a Pfizer, you may be leading a medical team, but the business people have all the power. That is a huge adjustment, and for some, a narcissistic blow,” explains Kerry J. Sulkowicz, a clinical professor of psychiatry at NYU Medical Center and founder of the Boswell Group, a consulting firm focusing on the psychology of business for CEOs and other business leaders. “The rewards of [industry] work are promotion and financial. Academia tends to be much more intellectual. For academics, whether scientists or clinicians, the more they can see themselves as business people, albeit with [a science] background, the more successful they will be. When they start to work for Pfizer, they will be, first and foremost, business people.” Collaborative processes as well as milestones, project plans, and go/no-go decisions are not typical in the academic setting, points out Giulio Superti-Furga, scientific director of the Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. Superti-Furga, who spent a year at Genentech as a PhD student before becoming a staff scientist and team leader at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, is cofounder of the biotech company Cellzome. “You need a higher degree of social competence in the industry setting,” he says. Also, you are up against a bias from current employees. “There is a certain skepticism in the pharma setting for people coming from academia,” says Superti-Furga. “Industrial researchers need to give people who come from academics some time to learn.” Neuroscientist Marc Tessier-Lavigne, who became senior vice president of research drug discovery at Genentech in 2003, consulted for companies while a Howard Hughes investigator at Stanford University. But, he says, it's “not the same thing as doing it, as being inside. There was a learning curve on the research side, in translation,” he recalls of first going to Genentech. “And learning about drug discovery and development, what makes a good drug… I was thrown in the deep end, sink or swim, but given a lot of help and mentoring.” There are also other aspects of the transition to industry that take some getting used to for senior researchers immersed in the academic environment. “When you go into industry, your public record is diminished,” points out Philip Needleman, who spent 25 years at Washington University School of Medicine as a professor and chairman of the department of pharmacology before becoming senior vice president of Monsanto and president of Searle Research and Development. “You are no longer on study sections. In industry, you have meetings for decisions, not discussion. I forgot how academia is so Talmudic.” But industry is not for everyone. Nathanael S. Gray was at GNF in San Diego for more than seven years before moving to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston as an assistant professor. He says he was getting too removed from the bench. “Most pharmas have two tracks: management and a scientific ladder track. If you want to grow, you pretty much need to take the management track, and pushed away from science, it becomes personnel management. I wanted to stay closer to the science,” he says. Gray, who works on kinase inhibitors relevant to oncology at Dana Farber, says he has brought his experiences and contacts from industry to his new position. “For me, it was a very valuable experience, it was a start-up environment which had the resources of Novartis. There are a large number of people you meet and rub shoulders with. In academia, it is more cloistered.” Roy Vagelos, former CEO of Merck, tells the story of two top researchers at the company who eventually returned to academia. It hadn't been their scientific acumen or, necessarily, their rate of making significant discoveries. “The difference with those folks,” says Vagelos, was that “they never got the bug that I went to Merck with, that drug discovery is the most important thing you can do in your life.” Genentech has been particularly successful in recruiting top academic researchers, including most recently Ira Mellman, to work at its headquarters in South San Francisco. This is partly because Genentech has created an environment where academics feel at home. “I was intrigued enough to take the position realizing I could have my cake and eat it too,” says Vishva Dixit, a vice president and staff scientist at Genentech. (Dixit was lured to the company 10 years ago from his tenured position at the University of Michigan Medical School.) “I could continue to run my own research program while contributing to” translational research at the company, says Dixit. The ability of academic researchers to move to Genentech with their labs is a major asset. Points out Mellman, “I took my lab…, one part of my existence is still defined by that, being a basic scientist, addressing fundamental questions in the laboratory.” “If you give up a lab, participation changes with the international community of scientists, you don't control your own research position,” he says. But having a lab means that you need to publish your research. Mellman says that at Genentech while research is vetted for proprietary or possible trade secrets prior to submission to a journal, publication is encouraged. Another example of the academic aspect to Genentech is their postdoctoral fellows program run by Dixit, which currently has about 100 postdocs. In this program “the funding is guaranteed for four years, they are free to work on anything they want with their mentors, as long as it is cutting edge research and they publish, …[and they are] not allowed to work on a product-related project,” says Dixit. After four years in the program, on average about 10 percent of postdocs get hired by Genentech, 10 percent go back to academia, and 80 percent go to other jobs or law school, etc., he says. But aside from being a potential employee pool, the postdoctoral program also helps to lure leading academics to the campus. “I was invited to Genentech by postdocs to do a seminar,” says Ira Mellman. “I ran into an old friend, Richard Scheller.” (Scheller, executive vice president of research at Genentech, used to be an HHMI investigator at Stanford.) “We talked, he started a process of trying to convince me to come here.” For Mellman, who was scientific director of the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, the offer struck a nerve. His mother had died of ovarian cancer, and recently his lab manager from Yale also died of the disease. When she was diagnosed, Mellman recalls his wife saying to him, “if you guys are so smart, why can't you do something to help her?” “Why indeed?” says Mellman. “It almost becomes a moral obligation to do it.” And, by this time, he had shed any illusions about academic research. “Once you become a PI you say you have great academic freedom, on paper it's true, but in reality you don't,” says Mellman. “You're not free, you're a slave to your own success… You need to keep building on your base to keep grant renewals. It's an illusion to think you are completely unfettered. You can't wake up and decide to work on worms, in two years when grants are due you would be laughed out of study sections.” A major difference for him between life in academia and in industry at Genentech, he says, is that “in academia you can be a success by being interesting. Here, it is assured that you are interesting, but you have to be useful. It's a different kind of intellectual challenge.”"
