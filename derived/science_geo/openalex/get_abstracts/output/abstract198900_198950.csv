https://openalex.org/W2007959075,"My conclusions are these: (i) The cells which mediate primary rewarding effects are located in a midline system running from the midbrain through the hypothalamus and midline thalamus and into the subcortical and cortical groups of the rhinencephalon. (ii) The cell groups which mediate primary rewarding effects are different from those which mediate primary punishing effects. (iii) Despite this relative independence, there are, undoubtedly, relationships of mutual inhibition existing between these two systems. Rewards do, among other things, tend to reduce sensitivity to pain, and punishments do tend to reduce rewarding effects. (iv) These primary reward systems of the brain are subdivided into specific drive-reward subsystems mediating the specific drives such as hunger and sex. (v) Because there are also subsystems of this set of rewarding structures sensitive to different chemical effects, it is reasonable to hope that eventually it will be possible to control the reward systems pharmacologically in cases where behavior disorders seem to result from deficits or surfeits of positive motivation."

Congdon et al. 2 have worked on the lines that this condition might be due to recovery of the host animals' capacity to eliminate the foreign graft. We3 and Uphoff4 have favoured the idea that it was due to reaction by the graft against the host."

https://openalex.org/W1986775557,"DURING some experimental work carried out on the cytology of early oocysts of Plasmodium cynomolgi in Anopheles stephensi an interesting observation was made. Three batches of laboratory-bred Anopheles stephensi were fed on a rhesus monkey (M. 172) infected with P. cynomolgi. Dissections of 4–10 mosquitoes on each subsequent day showed that the first and third batches of these mosquitoes were also infected with a microsporidian (Plistophora culicis). (Such infections have previously been described by Garnham1 and Canning2.) Nearly 50 per cent of the dissected mosquitoes showed a moderate infection of P. culicis in the first batch, a light infection of about 5 per cent in the second batch, and approximately 100 per cent with heavy infections of P. culicis in the third batch. A poor rate of infection by P. cynomolgi was found in the first and third batches of A. stephensi, and this was considered due to the partial inhibitory influence of P. culicis on the development of the oocysts in these mosquitoes. This view was supported by the findings of good oocysts counts in the mosquitoes dissected from batch two in which the P. culicis infections were very light."

This organ is useful for investigating the fine structure of sweat glands with the electron microscope, since the conglomerated body of the gland is easily seen with the naked eye and most of the glandular tissue is found within the small field of the electron microscope. The tissue was fixed in 1 per cent osmic acid and buffered at pH 7.4 with acetate–veronal or phosphate buffer, washed for a short time and then dehydrated with ethanol in a graded series of concentrations. The specimens were embedded in a mixture of n-butyl and methyl methacrylate (7 : 3), and were cut into sections less than 0.05µ thick with a thermal expansion microtome (JUM-4) fitted with a glass knife. Embedded sections were examined in a JEM-3 electron microscope."
https://openalex.org/W2058586835,"THE time taken for Russell viper venom to accelerate the clotting of fasting human plasma poor in platelets—the Stypven time—is relatively long. The addition of very small quantities of some active phospholipids1,2 to this system produces a shortening of the Stypven time, and the shortening is proportional to the quantity added. It may be concluded that there is very little available active phospholipid in fasting platelet-poor plasma. A simple phospholipid extraction of fasting platelet-poor plasma yields a material that greatly accelerates the Stypven time of platelet-poor plasma. It is concluded that there are molecules of active phospholipids in plasma, but that they are ‘unavailable’ for this test and presumably are bound in the plasma proteins."

Most of the work has been done in normal animals, using simple antigens. Few direct comparisons have been made of the distribution of labelled antigens in normal and immune animals, and no work seems to have been done along these lines with a killed bacterial antigen."

https://openalex.org/W2054029157,"RECENTLY, suggestions have been made that acetylcholine in nerve tissue is associated with structural entities termed ‘vesicles’1. The ideas are compatible with a quantum concept of nerve transmission2. The evidence that acetylcholine is released from mammalian nerve tissue by physical means3 lends further support to the structural inclusion of acetylcholine within the nerve cell and casts doubt on the hypothesis that it is held in chemical combination. The following results on the release of acetylcholine from cockroach thoracic cord by osmotic pressure and homogenization makes the existence of a chemical combination in insects doubtful."
https://openalex.org/W1991349869,"IT is well known that the administration of large amounts of cortisone to experimental animals is associated with the production of hyperglycaemia1. There is also evidence from clinical cases that in diabetes the therapeutic use of cortisone increases considerably the daily amount of insulin required to maintain the blood-sugar within normal limits2. The nature of this contra-insulin effect of cortisone is uncertain, but it has been suggested that it may be due to excessive destruction of insulin since there is no definite evidence that contra-insulin factors are responsible for a marked increase in the peripheral requirements for insulin3."

https://openalex.org/W1996660618,"THE characteristic mass of sex chromatin, first observed by Barr and Bertram1 in the nerve cells of the female cat, can be identified in the cells of several different tissues in the human female2. The method of ‘nuclear sexing’ is now a well-recognized technique of exceptional importance in the investigation of disorders of human sexual development. The technique has been applied to the study of human tumours and, provided that good histological preparations have been available, it has been found, in most cases, that sex chromatin was recognizable in the cells of tumours of female patients but not in those of males, that is, the tumour is of the same sex as the host3–5. The principal exception is in the case of teratomata, which are always of female nuclear sex if the host is female, but may be male or female if the host is male3–6. Two alternative hypotheses have been postulated in explanation of this anomaly: one presumes that the tumour arises by parthenogenesis of haploid germ cells followed by endomitosis to restore the diploid chromosome number; the other supposes that the tumour arises by conjugation of two haploid germ cells."
https://openalex.org/W1999627191,"IN order to investigate the mechanical aspects of digestion in the ruminant stomach, pressure variations occurring within the reticulo-rumen have been measured on many occasions1–3, using balloons connected to liquid-filled manometers or to recording tambours. Wester1 reported that the intra-ruminal pressure in the cow showed phasic fluctuations of 2.5 cm. mercury, while Quin, Van der Wath and Myburgh2 recorded a maximal rise of 10.0 cm. water in the sheep; in both instances the basal intra-ruminal pressure was close to atmospheric pressure. Balch, Kelly and Heim3, using a balloon connected to a writing tambour, recorded pressure-changes from within the reticulum of the cow and showed a basic level of 2.5–3.5 cm. mercury above atmospheric pressure rising by 1–2 cm. mercury with contraction of the reticulum. It is probable that in the latter case the higher resting pressure is due to the hydrostatic effect of the liquid contents of the reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2032221332,"JINKS1 suggests that where phenotypic variation is caused by a cytoplasmic system, the range of phenotypic expression attainable by the system would have quite definite limits imposed by the system itself (cytoplasmic limits) or, by the non-viability of phenotypes lying outside these limits (physiological limits). Cytoplasmic limits would result where further changes in cytoplasmic content are impossible, as when all cytoplasmic elements involved in the change are lost. Physiological limits would result where although more extreme changes in the cytoplasm are possible they would lead only to non-viable phenotypes. Jinks's results suggested a physiological basis to limits of variation obtained in Aspergillus glaucus."
