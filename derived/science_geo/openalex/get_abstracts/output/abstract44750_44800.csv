https://openalex.org/W1980979311,"We have isolated and analyzed eight strict maternal effect mutations identifying four genes, par-1, par-2, par-3, and par-4, required for cytoplasmic localization in early embryos of the nematode C. elegans. Mutations in these genes lead to defects in cleavage patterns, timing of cleavages, and localization of germ line-specific P granules. Four mutations in par-1 and par-4 are fully expressed maternal effect lethal mutations; all embryos from mothers homozygous for these mutations arrest as amorphous masses of differentiated cells but are specifically lacking intestinal cells. Four mutations in par-2, par-3, and par-4 are incompletely expressed maternal effect lethal mutations and are also grandchildless; some embryos from homozygous mothers survive and grow to become infertile adults due to absence of functional germ cells. We propose that all of these defects result from the failure of a maternally encoded system for intracellular localization in early embryos."
https://openalex.org/W1586986973,"Hepatocytes obtained from rats fed a choline-deficient diet for 3 days were cultured in a medium +/- choline (100 microM) or methionine (200 microM). We investigated how choline deficiency affected hepatic lipogenesis, apolipoprotein synthesis, and lipoprotein secretion. The mass of triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine secreted was increased about 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively, by the addition of either choline or methionine to the cultured cells. Similarly, a 3-fold stimulation in the secretion of [3H]triacylglycerol and [3H]phosphatidylcholine derived from [3H]oleate was observed after the addition of choline or methionine. Fractionation of secreted lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation revealed that the reduced secretion of triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine from choline-deficient cells was mainly due to impaired secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (but not high density lipoproteins (HDL)). Fluorography of L-[4,5-3H]leucine-labeled lipoproteins showed a remarkable inhibition of VLDL secretion by choline deficiency. The addition of choline or methionine stimulated the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and increased the cellular phosphatidylcholine levels to that in normal cells. While there was little effect of choline on the synthesis and amount of cellular phosphatidylethanolamine, the addition of methionine diminished cellular phosphatidylethanolamine levels. Choline deficiency did not change the rate of incorporation of L-[4,5-3H]leucine into cellular VLDL apolipoproteins, nor the rate of disappearance of radioactivity from L-[4,5-3H]leucine-labeled cellular apoB, apoE, and apoC. These results suggest that hepatic secretion of VLDL, but not HDL, requires active phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Secondly, the inhibitory effect of choline deficiency on VLDL secretion can be compensated by the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine."
https://openalex.org/W1984126072,"Large nuclear proteins must possess a signal sequence to pass through the nuclear pores. Using an in vitro system, we have been able experimentally to dissect nuclear protein transport into two distinct steps: binding and translocation. In the absence of ATP, we observe a binding of nuclear proteins to the pore that is signal sequence-dependent. Translocation through the pore, on the other hand, strictly requires ATP. These steps, visualized in the fluorescence and electron microscopes, were observed both with a natural nuclear protein, nucleoplasmin, and a synthetic nuclear protein, composed of the signal sequence of SV40 T antigen coupled to HSA. When a mutant signal sequence was coupled to HSA, neither transport nor binding were observed, indicating that both result from the presence of a functional signal sequence. An inhibitor of transport, the lectin WGA, also arrested nuclear proteins in a bound state at the cytoplasmic face of the pore. Therefore, only the translocation step is sensitive to the inhibitor WGA, which is known to bind specifically to proteins of the nuclear pore."
https://openalex.org/W2007319015,"We have generated a series of rat fibroblast cell linesthat stably overexpress a full-length cDNA encoding the Î²1 form of protein kinase C (PKC). These cell lines contain a 20-to 53-fold increase in PKC activity and exhibit dramatically enhanced morphologic changes following exposure to the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). They grow to a high saturation density in monolayer cultures and, when maintained at postconfluence, develop small, dense foci. In contrast to control cells, which display complete anchorage dependence, PKC-overproducing cells form small colonies in soft agar in the absence of TPA and large colonies in the presence of TPA. Thus, the mere overproduction of a single form of PKC is sufficient to confer multiple growth abnormalities in rat fibroblasts. These results provide direct evidence that PKC plays a critical role in growth control and that it mediates several of the cellular effects of the phorbol ester tumor promoters. They also suggest that the activation of PKC may be of central importance in the process of multistage carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1990748978,"Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies. The role of sand fly saliva in transmission of the disease was investigated by injecting mice with Leishmania major parasites in the presence of homogenized salivary glands from Lutzomyia longipalpis. This procedure resulted in cutaneous lesions of Leishmania major that were routinely five to ten times as large and contained as much as 5000 times as many parasites as controls. With inocula consisting of low numbers of Leishmania major, parasites were detected at the site of injection only when the inoculum also contained salivary gland material. This enhancing effect of sand fly salivary glands on cutaneous leishmaniasis occurred with as little as 10 percent of the contents of one salivary gland of one fly. Material obtained from other bloodsucking arthropods could not mediate the phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2032850298,"Functionally distinct subpopulations of endosomes involved in targeting internalized materials to specific intracellular destinations were resolved as two distinct peaks by free-flow electrophoresis. The less anodally shifted peak contained a population of early endosomes selectively labeled by brief exposures to endocytic tracers or by receptor-bound transferrin. Late endosomes, labeled only after longer periods of internalization, migrated more toward the anode. While both fluid phase and certain receptor-bound markers could be rapidly chased from early to late endosomes, transferrin remained in vesicles comigrating with early endosomes even after prolonged uptake. Thus early and late endosomes are kinetically related but functionally distinct: early endosomes serve as the major site of recycling membrane and surface receptors and late endosomes are involved in delivery to lysosomes. The subpopulations each contain unique polypeptides not found on the plasma membrane. Thus, endosomes cannot be derived entirely from internalized cell surface components, and may have at least partly independent biosynthetic origins."
https://openalex.org/W2167721895,"Mutations in the single-minded (sim) gene of Drosophila results in the loss of the precursor cells giving rise to the midline cells of the embryonic central nervous system. We have examined the structure of the sim product by sequencing a sim cDNA clone, and have also determined the subcellular localization of the protein and its developmental expression by staining embryos with an antiserum against a sim fusion protein. The results indicate that sim is a nuclear protein specifically expressed along the midline of the neuroepithelium, the same subset of cells that are missing in the mutant. No similarity is observed between sim and any known nuclear protein, but, surprisingly, it is similar to the Drosophila period (per) locus gene product, which controls the periodicity of biological rhythms."

The model learns to position an arm so that it reaches a cylinder arbitrarily positioned in space. The model uses a new neural architecture and a new algorithm for modifying neural-connection strengths. Computer simulations show that the model performs with an average position error of 4% of the arm's length and with an average orientation error of 4 degrees. The model is designed to be generalized for coordinating any number of topographic sensory inputs with limbs of any number of joints."
https://openalex.org/W1970627065,Urate oxidase (E.C. 1.7.3.3) catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin in most mammals except humans and certain primates. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence for porcine urate oxidase was determined and used in a novel procedure for generating complementary DNA (cDNA) probes to this amino acid sequence. The procedure is based on the polymerase chain reaction and utilizes mixed oligonucleotide primers complementary to the reverse translation products of an amino acid sequence. This rapid and simple cDNA cloning procedure is generally applicable and requires only a partial amino acid sequence. A cDNA probe developed by this procedure was used to isolate a full-length porcine urate oxidase cDNA and to demonstrate the presence of homologous genomic sequences in humans.
https://openalex.org/W1553656745,"The effect of glucocorticoids on the regulation of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA was studied in two different cell lines, human IM-9 lymphocytes and rat pancreatic acinar AR42J cells. Using a glucocorticoid receptor cDNA probe, glucocorticoid receptor mRNA was examined by Northern blot hybridization and quantitated by slot-blot hybridization. In IM-9 and AR42J cells, dexamethasone decreased steady-state glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels to approximately 50% of control. This decrease occurred with a one-half time of 3 h for IM-9 cells and 6 h for AR42J cells. Dexamethasone was the most potent steroid tested with a one-half maximal effect occurring at 10 nM and a maximal effect occurring at 100 nM. Glucocorticoid receptor mRNA half-life and gene transcription were then studied to determine the mechanism of decreased mRNA levels. The glucocorticoid mRNA half-life was approximately 120 min in IM-9 cells and 240 min in AR42J cells; these rates were not affected by dexamethasone treatment. In contrast, the rate of glucocorticoid gene transcription as measured by run-on assays in IM-9 cells was decreased to 50 +/- 6% of control by dexamethasone. These results indicate therefore that glucocorticoids regulate glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels by influencing gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1570484367,"The asparagine-linked sugar chains of human erythropoietin produced by recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells and naturally occurring human urinary erythropoietin were liberated by hydrazinolysis and fractionated by paper electrophoresis, lectin affinity chromatography, and Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography. Both erythropoietins had three asparagine-linked sugar chains in one molecule, all of which were acidic complex type. Structural analysis of them revealed that the sugar chains from both erythropoietins are quite similar except for sialyl linkage. All sugar chains of erythropoietin produced by recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells contain only the NeuAc alpha 2----3Gal linkage, while those of human urinary erythropoietin contain the NeuAc alpha 2----6Gal linkage together with the NeuAc alpha 2----3Gal linkage. The major sugar chains were of fucosylated tetraantennary complex type with and without N-acetyllactosamine repeating units in their outer chain moieties in common, and small amounts of 2,4- and 2,6-branched triantennary and biantennary sugar chains were detected. This paper proved, for the first time, that recombinant technique can produce glycoprotein hormone whose carbohydrate structures are common to the major sugar chains of the native one."
https://openalex.org/W1519008651,"The effect of the middle T oncogene of polyoma virus was studied in vivo using a replication-defective selectable retrovirus. Injection of virus into newborn and adult mice resulted in the rapid appearance of cavernous hemangiomas. Infection of embryos did not yield transgenic mice; therefore, embryonal stem (ES) cells were used as an alternative system. Several infected ES cell clones were established that constitutively expressed middle T and its associated tyrosine kinase activity. Chimeric embryos obtained by blastocyst injection of individual ES cell clones were specifically arrested at midgestation, when multiple hemangiomas disrupted blood vessel formation. From these tumors endothelial cell lines were established that retained expression of von Willebrand factor yet were tumorigenic in vivo. These results suggest that middle T acts in endothelial cells as a single-step oncogene and that ES cells provide a valuable system for the study of growth control during embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2063751484,"The embryonic neuroepithelium of Drosophila gives rise to the central nervous system. We have studied the mutant phenotype and expression of a gene, single-minded (sim), which is involved in generating a specific region of this neuroepithelium. In sim mutant embryos, a subset of neuronal and nonneuronal precursor cells lying along the midline fail to emerge with the rest of the neuroepithelium. We have identified the sim transcription unit and have shown by in situ hybridization to embryos that the sim gene is expressed specifically in the midline neuroepithelium. Both the mutant phenotype and the temporal and spatial expression of transcripts suggest that the sim gene plays a key role in the emergence of this subset of cells along the midline of the developing central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2018737282,"Prolactin gene expression is negatively regulated by glucocorticoids, and by estrogens when positive estrogen regulatory elements in the prolactin gene are removed. Mutational analysis of estrogen receptor confirms that inhibition is a function of receptor, and that transcriptional activation and inhibition require distinct, separable structural elements. Inhibition is dependent on a 63 amino acid region (amino acids 251-314) distinct from the DNA-binding and steroid-binding domains. The comparable region of glucocorticoid receptor confers inhibitory actions on a hybrid receptor. Multiple, nonoverlapping sequences in the rat prolactin 5'-flanking genomic region that confer inhibition by both steroid hormones contain related cis-active elements that bind a common, tissue-specific positive transcription factor, called Pit-1. Experimental results indicate that positive and negative transcriptional effects of estrogen receptor are mediated by separate functional domains, and suggest the protein-protein interactions between steroid hormone receptors and other transcription factor(s) mediate inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1997820230,"Functional nicotinic cholinergic receptors are found on mammalian retinal ganglion cell neurons in culture. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) can be detected in the medium of many of these retinal cultures, after release presumably from the choline acetyltransferase-positive amacrine cells. The postsynaptic effect of endogenous or applied ACh on the ganglion cells can be blocked with specific nicotinic antagonists. Here it is shown that within 24 hours of producing such a pharmacologic blockade, the retinal ganglion cells begin to sprout or regenerate neuronal processes. Thus, the growth-enhancing effect of nicotinic antagonists may be due to the removal of inhibition to growth by tonic levels of ACh present in the culture medium. Since there is a spontaneous leak of ACh in the intact retina, the effects of nicotinic cholinergic drugs on process outgrowth in culture may reflect a normal control mechanism for growth or regeneration of retinal ganglion cell processes that is exerted by ACh in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1553117981,"Through substitution mutagenesis we identified the promoter elements responsible for basal expression and sterol-mediated repression of transcription of the gene for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a rate-controlling enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. Mutant promoters containing 277 base pairs (bp) of reductase 5' flanking sequence were inserted into recombinant plasmids upstream of the coding region for bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The plasmids were transfected into hamster fibroblasts, and transcription was measured in the presence and absence of sterols. Mutations in three regions that are known to bind nuclear proteins markedly reduced transcription. Mutation of another protein-binding region of 20 bp in length did not reduce transcription, but it did abolish sterol-mediated repression, producing an operator constitutive phenotype. This mutation also abolished protein binding to the corresponding 20-bp region of DNA as determined by footprinting assays. When a DNA fragment containing these 20 bp was inserted into the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, sterol-mediated repression was observed. This sequence contains an octanucleotide that shows a 7/8-bp match with a previously identified regulatory sequence in repeat 2 of the low density lipoprotein receptor promoter, another sterol-repressible gene. We hypothesize that this octanucleotide, GTGGCGGTG, is the core binding site for a sterol-dependent protein that represses transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1974949994,"Two-dimensional crystals of cholera toxin bound to receptors in a lipid membrane give diffraction extending to 15 Ã resolution. Three-dimensional structure determination reveals a ring of five B subunits on the membrane surface, with one-third of the A subunit occupying the center of the ring. The remaining mass of the A subunit appears to penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. Cleavage of a disulfide bond in the A subunit, which activates the toxin, causes a major conformational change, with the A subunit mostly exiting from the B ring."
https://openalex.org/W1489931243,"Previous studies have indicated that at least part of the selection of proteins for degradation takes place at a binding site on ubiquitin-protein ligase, to which the protein substrate is bound prior to ligation to ubiquitin. It was also shown that proteins with free NH2-terminal alpha-NH2 groups bind better to this site than proteins with blocked NH2 termini (Hershko, A., Heller, H., Eytan, E., and Reiss, Y. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11992-11999). In the present study, we used simple derivatives of amino acids, such as methyl esters, hydroxamates, or dipeptides, to examine the question of whether the protein binding site of the ligase is able to distinguish between different NH2-terminal residues of proteins. Based on specific patterns of inhibition of the binding to ligase by these derivatives, three types of protein substrates could be distinguished. Type I substrates are proteins that have a basic NH2-terminal residue (such as ribonuclease and lysozyme); these are specifically inhibited by derivatives of the 3 basic amino acids (His, Arg, and Lys) with respect to degradation, ligation to ubiquitin, and binding to ligase. Type II substrates (such as beta-lactoglobulin or pepsinogen, that have a Leu residue at the NH2 terminus) are not affected by the above compounds, but are specifically inhibited by derivatives of bulky hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Trp, Phe, and Tyr). In these cases, the amino acid derivatives apparently act as specific inhibitors of the binding of the NH2-terminal residue of proteins, as indicated by the following observations: (a) derivatives in which the alpha-NH2 group is blocked were inactive and (b) in dipeptides, the inhibitory amino acid residue had to be at the NH2-terminal position. An additional class (Type III) of substrates comprises proteins that have neither basic nor bulky hydrophobic NH2-terminal amino acid residues; the binding of these proteins is not inhibited by homologous amino acid derivatives that have NH2-terminal residues similar to that of the protein. It is concluded that Type I and Type II proteins bind to distinct and separate subsites of the ligase, specific for basic or bulky hydrophobic NH2-terminal residues, respectively. On the other hand, Type III proteins apparently predominantly interact with the ligase at regions of the protein molecule other than the NH2-terminal residue."
https://openalex.org/W1555680215,"Adrenodoxin is an iron-sulfur protein serving as an electron transport intermediate for two mitochondrial steroidogenic cytochromes P450. We have cloned and sequenced three human adrenal adrenodoxin cDNAs. The longest 5â-untranslated region was 131 bases long, and the coding sequences, identical in all three clones, predict a preprotein of 180 amino acids. The 3â-untranslated regions were 235, 596, and 776 bases long due to the presence of alternate polyadenylation sites. RNA transfer blots showed multiple size species of adrenodoxin mRNA consistent with finding multiple polyadenylation sites. Similar sized cross-hybridizing RNA species are found abundantly in the adrenal and testis and to a lesser degree in RNA from human fetal brain, spleen, placenta, kidney, liver, and intestine, as well as in cultured fibroblasts, suggesting the same or a very similar iron-sulfur protein is found in mitochondria of nonsteroidogenic tissues. JEG-3 cells, a transformed progesterone-producing line of trophoblastic origin, accumulate mRNAs for cytochrome P450scc (the mitochondrial cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme), adrenodoxin, and the fos oncogene when stimulated with 8-bromo-cyclic AMP. Addition of actinomycin D to such cultures blocked cAMP-induced accumulation of mRNAs for cytochrome P450scc and adrenodoxin. Addition of cycloheximide or puromycin to such cultures substantially reduced basal levels and markedly attenuated the cAMP-induced accumulation of cytochrome P450scc mRNA, but augmented the accumulation of adrenodoxin and fos mRNAs in additive and multiplicative fashions, respectively. These data indicate that the cAMP-induced synthesis of the steroidogenic machinery is not wholly dependent on cycloheximide-sensitive protein mediators."
https://openalex.org/W1555656146,"Abstract The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, which exhibits intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity, undergoes a rapid, intramolecular self-phosphorylation reaction following EGF activation. The primary sites of tyrosine self-phosphorylation in vivo are located in the extreme carboxyl-terminal region of the molecule, principally Tyr-1173. To test the biological and biochemical consequences of this EGF receptor self-phosphorylation, we made the mutation Tyr----Phe-1173. Membranes containing the mutated receptor exhibited an ED50 for EGF activation of tyrosine kinase activity equivalent to control receptor at both high and low substrate levels, but exhibited reduced basal and EGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity at low, non-saturating substrate levels. The Tyr----Phe-1173 mutant possessed high affinity EGF binding and could still self-phosphorylate other tyrosine sites in an intramolecular fashion with a low Km for ATP (200 nM), suggesting that this alteration did not grossly change receptor structure. When EGF-dependent growth of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing comparable levels of control or mutant EGF receptor was measured, the ability of the mutant receptor to mediate cell growth in response to EGF was reduced by approximately 50%, yet both receptors exhibited a similar affinity and ED50 for EGF. These results support the concept that this self-phosphorylation site can act as a competitive/alternate substrate for the EGF receptor, and that this region of the molecule is important in modulating its maximal biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1594838119,"A testicular paracrine factor, P-Mod-S, was purified from conditioned medium obtained from serum-free cultures of peritubular cells. Stimulation of testicular transferrin production by cultured Sertoli cells was utilized as a bio-assay for P-Mod-S. A bioactive protein with an apparent molecular weight of 50,000 under physiological conditions was isolated by high pressure size exclusion chromatography. P-Mod-S was found to have an affinity for heparin and bound to a heparin affinity column. Two forms of P-Mod-S were purified with reverse-phase chromatography. The less hydrophobic form was referred to as P-Mod-S (A) and is a 56,000 molecular weight protein. The more hydrophobic form was referred to as P-Mod-S (B) and is a 59,000 molecular weight protein. Purification of P-Mod-S (A) and P-Mod-S (B) from peritubular cell-radiolabeled secreted proteins revealed that both proteins contain radioactivity. This result demonstrates active synthesis and secretion of P-Mod-S by peritubular cells. Although the amino acid composition of the two proteins indicates distinct differences in the content of several amino acids, the relationship of P-Mod-S (A) and P-Mod-S (B) is unknown at present. A greater than 1000-fold increase in the specific activity of P-Mod-S was achieved with the purification procedure utilized. P-Mod-S can account for essentially all the bioactivity present in crude peritubular cell-secreted protein preparations. The effects of the two forms of P-Mod-S on both transferrin and androgen-binding protein production by Sertoli cells was examined. Purified forms of P-Mod-S were found to have a greater effect on Sertoli cell function than any individual regulatory agent previously known to influence the cell, including follicle-stimulating hormone. The significance of peritubular cell-Sertoli cell interactions mediated via P-Mod-S to spermatogenesis and testicular function is discussed, as well as insight provided into general mesenchymal-epithelial cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2027813738,"Initiation of DNA replication from ori beta of plasmid R6K requires the presence of the ori gamma sequence in cis. We demonstrate that binding of initiator protein to the seven strong, tandem binding sites in gamma increases binding of the protein at the very weak binding site present in ori beta by cooperativity at a distance. The gamma-beta interaction via the initiator results in a DNA loop, as revealed by the novel technique of cyclization enhancement and as confirmed by exonuclease III protection, electron microscopy, and chemical footprinting. The protein-mediated gamma-beta interaction in vitro suggests that the cooperative interaction of gamma-bound protein with the beta sequence by DNA looping is an early step in the initiation of DNA replication at the beta origin of R6K."
https://openalex.org/W2081393029,"A complementary DNA encoding the human low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor under control of the mouse metallothionein-I promoter was injected into fertilized mouse eggs, and a strain of mice expressing high levels of LDL receptors was established. After administration of cadmium, these mice cleared intravenously injected 125I-labeled LDL from blood eight to ten times more rapidly than did normal mice. The plasma concentrations of apoproteins B-100 and E, the two ligands for the LDL receptor, declined by more than 90 percent after cadmium treatment, but the concentration of another apoprotein, A-I, was unaffected. Therefore, overexpression of an endocytotic receptor can dramatically lower the ambient concentration of its ligand in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1483715738,"The release of free arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids is believed to be the rate-controlling step in the production of the prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and related metabolites in inflammatory cells such as the macrophage. We have previously identified several different phospholipases in the macrophage-like cell line P388D1 potentially capable of controlling arachidonic acid release. Among them, a membrane-bound, alkaline pH optimum, Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2 is of particular interest because of the likelihood that the regulatory enzyme has these properties. This phospholipase A2 has now been solubilized from the membrane fraction with octyl glucoside and partially purified. The first two steps in this purification are butanol extractions that yield a lyophilized, stable preparation of phospholipase A2 lacking other phospholipase activities. This phospholipase A2 shows considerably more activity when assayed in the presence of glycerol, regardless of whether the substrate, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, is in the form of sonicated vesicles or mixed micelles with the nonionic surfactant Triton X-100. Glycerol (70%) increases both the Vmax and the Km with both substrate forms, giving a Vmax of about 15 nmol min-1 mg-1 and an apparent Km of about 60 microM for vesicles and a Vmax of about 100 nmol min-1 mg-1 and an apparent Km of about 1 mM for mixed micelles. Vmax/Km is slightly greater for vesicles than for mixed micelles. The lyophilized preparation of the enzyme is routinely purified about 60-fold and is suitable for evaluating phospholipase A2 inhibitors such as manoalide analogues. Subsequent steps in the purification are acetonitrile extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography on an Aquapore BU-300 column and a Superose 12 column. This yields a 2500-fold purification of the membrane-bound phospholipase A2 with a 25% recovery and a specific activity of about 800 nmol min-1 mg-1 toward 100 microM dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine in mixed micelles. When this material was subjected to analysis on a Superose 12 sizing column, the molecular mass of the active fraction was approximately 18,000 daltons."
https://openalex.org/W1607473045,"Addition of Hg2+ to mitochondria of rat kidney induces efflux of intramitochondrial Ca2+. This reaction is accompanied by a diminution of the NAD(P)H/NAD(P) ratio and a decrease of the internal negative membrane potential. These effects were enhanced by dithiothreitol. The binding of mercuric ions to mitochondria saturates with a maximal binding of 9 nmol min-1 mg-1. The stoichiometry between Ca2+ released and Hg2+ bound showed that in the presence of dithiothreitol, the binding of approximately 1 nmol of Hg2+/mg of protein suffices to induce the release of the accumulated Ca2+. In the electrophoretic analysis of Hg-labeled mitochondrial proteins it was found that 203Hg2+ bound mainly to proteins that have molecular masses of 20 and 30 kDa. It is proposed that Hg2+-induced Ca2+ release is due to modification of--SH groups of these latter proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1551661793,"Proteoglycans exist in cartilage as complexes in which many proteoglycan molecules are bound to a central filament of hyaluronic acid. Many studies have investigated changes taking place in proteoglycan monomer structure during cartilage catabolism usually under the assumption that hyaluronic acid is a relatively inert metabolic component of the complex. In this paper we present organ culture data supporting a new hypothesis that the catabolism of proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid are coordinately regulated by chondrocytes. The data indicates that: 1) newly synthesized hyaluronate and proteoglycan maintain a nearly constant ratio, almost identical to that existing for the total chemical amounts of these two components in cartilage tissue; 2) these two components are catabolized with virtually identical kinetics; and 3) this catabolic relationship in vitro reflects the loss of hyaluronate and proteoglycans from native, undissociated aggregates as isolated from the tissue. We conclude that hyaluronate catabolism is an integral part of the overall mechanism of proteoglycan resorption in cartilage and that further understanding of this process may be key to the elucidation of the regulatory pathways for proteoglycan resorption in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1603747702,"Oxidative decarboxylation and transamination of 1-14C-branched chain amino and alpha-keto acids were examined in mitochondria isolated from rat heart. Transamination was inhibited by aminooxyacetate, but not by L-cycloserine. At equimolar concentrations of alpha-ketoiso[1-14C]valerate (KIV) and isoleucine, transamination was increased by disrupting the mitochondria with detergent which suggests transport may be one factor affecting the rate of transamination. Next, the subcellular distribution of the aminotransferase(s) was determined. Branched chain aminotransferase activity was measured using two concentrations of isoleucine as amino donor and [1-14C]KIV as amino acceptor. The data show that branched chain aminotransferase activity is located exclusively in the mitochondria in rat heart. Metabolism of extramitochondrial branched chain alpha-keto acids was examined using 20 microM [1-14C]KIV and alpha-ketoiso[1-14C]caproate (KIC). There was rapid uptake and oxidation of labeled branched chain alpha-keto acid, and, regardless of the experimental condition, greater than 90% of the labeled keto acid substrate was metabolized during the 20-min incubation. When a branched chain amino acid (200 microM) or glutamate (5 mM) was present, 30-40% of the labeled keto acid was transaminated while the remainder was oxidized. Provision of an alternate amino acceptor in the form of alpha-keto-glutarate (0.5 mM) decreased transamination of the labeled KIV or KIC and increased oxidation. Metabolism of intramitochondrially generated branched chain alpha-keto acids was studied using [1-14C]leucine and [1-14C]valine. Essentially all of the labeled branched chain alpha-keto acid produced by transamination of [1-14C]leucine or [1-14C]valine with a low concentration of unlabeled branched chain alpha-keto acid (20 microM) was oxidized. Further addition of alpha-ketoglutarate resulted in a significant increase in the rate of labeled leucine or valine transamination, but again most of the labeled keto acid product was oxidized. Thus, catabolism of branched chain amino acids will be favored by a high concentration of mitochondrial alpha-ketoglutarate and low intramitochondrial glutamate."

https://openalex.org/W1592243477,"Transport of 3,5-[3'-125I]triiodo-L-thyronine ([125I]T3) was studied in isolated rat liver hepatocytes. T3 transport was temperature-sensitive, the initial velocity of uptake, at low substrate concentration, was 60 times higher at 25 degrees C than at 0 degrees C. The activation energy of cellular uptake (26 kcal/mol) was different from that of binding to cytosolic proteins (6 kcal/mol), indicating that the latter was not the rate-limiting step. Uptake obeyed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with an apparent Km of 0.34 microM and a Vmax of 0.15 fmol/min/cell at 25 degrees C. No simple diffusion occurred. Unlabeled T3, L-thyroxine (T4), 3,5,3'-triiodo-D-thyronine, and triiodothyroacetic acid inhibited T3 uptake with Kl values of 0.32, 1.4, 4.1, and 5.4 microM, respectively, indicating specificity of uptake which was different from specificity of intracellular binding sites. [125I]T4 was also taken up by a saturable process (Km = 0.65 microM and Vmax = 0.16 fmol/min/cell at 25 degrees C). T3 was a better competitor than T4 for the uptake of [125I]T4, indicating that both hormones were taken up by the same carrier system. Metabolic inhibitors had either no effect on T3 uptake or inhibitory effects unrelated to cellular ATP depletion. Uptake was not affected by modification of the membrane potential or the sodium ion gradient. T3 and T4 uptake was pH-dependent. It is suggested that the un-ionized 4'-OH form of the hormones was preferentially taken up. Inhibition of uptake by various compounds was compared to inhibition of thyroid hormone binding to transthyretin, nuclear receptor, and cytosolic-binding proteins. We conclude that, in freshly isolated hepatocytes, thyroid hormones are taken up by a saturable, stereospecific, Na+-independent carrier system."
https://openalex.org/W2277205034,"The biosynthesis and post-translational modification of placental alkaline phosphatase were studied in human choriocarcinoma cells, JEG-3. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine demonstrated that placental alkaline phosphatase was synthesized as a major precursor form with Mr 63,000, which was then converted to a mature form with Mr 66,000, by processing of its N-linked oligosaccharides from the high-mannose type to the complex type. In addition, the two forms of the protein were found to be modified by a glycophospholipid, components of which were characterized by metabolic incorporation into placental alkaline phosphatase of 3H-labeled compounds such as myo-inositol, palmitic acid, stearic acid, mannose, glucosamine, and ethanolamine. When placental alkaline phosphatase labeled with these compounds was treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C or papain, the phospholipase C removed only the 3H-labeled fatty acids, whereas papain, that is known to cleave the C-terminal region, released all the radioactive glycolipid components including [3H]ethanolamine. More detailed analysis with shorter pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that placental alkaline phosphatase was primarily synthesized as a form with Mr 64,500 which was not yet labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. This form was converted by papain digestion to the above-mentioned major precursor with Mr 63,000. Taken together, these results suggest that placental alkaline phosphatase is initially synthesized as the precursor with Mr 64,500, which is immediately converted to the intermediate form with Mr 63,000 by simultaneously occurring proteolysis of the C terminus and replacement by the glycophospholipid, and finally to the mature form with Mr 66,000 by terminal glycosylation of its N-linked oligosaccharides. The glycophospholipid thus attached is considered to function as the membrane-anchoring domain of placental alkaline phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1564788695,"Alkanes are widely distributed in nature and impaired alkane synthesis was implicated in certain neurological disorders. However, the mechanism of synthesis of alkanes in animals is unknown. Our search to find a convenient animal tissue to study alkane biosynthesis resulted in the finding that the uropygial gland (a modified sebaceous gland) of the eared grebe (Podiceps nigricollis) produces large amounts of alkanes. These alkanes, which constitute 35-41% of the total lipid produced, are mainly C21, C23, C25, and C27 n-alkanes. Cell free homogenates of this tissue synthesized alkanes from both fatty acid and aldehyde in the absence of O2. Differential centrifugation of the homogenates indicated that this activity was located in the microsomal fraction. With isolated microsomes conversion of fatty acid to alkane required CoA, ATP, and NADH whereas conversion of an aldehyde to alkane did not require the addition of cofactors. That the final step in alkane synthesis is a decarbonylation was shown by the stoichiometric production of heptadecane and CO from octadecanal. CO was identified by adsorption to RhCl [(C6H6)3P]3 and oxidation of the trapped CO to CO2 by watergas shift reaction. The enzyme preparation also catalyzed incorporation of 14C from 14CO into octadecanal showing the reversible nature of the decarbonylase. This decarbonylase had a sharp pH optimum at 7.0, a Kapp of 180 microM and a V1/2 of 90 rho mol/min/mg protein for octadecanal. The enzyme was inhibited by the metal chelators EDTA, O-phenanthroline, and 8-hydroxyquinoline, but not by KCN. It was stimulated nearly 3-fold by 5 microM 2-mercaptoethanol and inhibited by the presence of O2. During the conversion of [1-3H]octadecanal to heptadecane, 3H was lost to water and 3H from 3H2O was incorporated into the alkane generated from unlabeled octadecanal. The mechanism of the decarbonylation and the nature of the enzyme remain to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1568442781,"We have purified luteinizing hormone/human choriogonadotropin (hCG) receptor from rat ovary by sequential affinity column on wheat germ lectin-Sepharose and hCG-Sepharose chromatography. The purified receptor, previously identified as a single protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Kusuda, S., and Dufau, M.L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16161-16168), was further characterized by radioiodination with 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3 alpha, 6 alpha-diphenylglycouril, and column chromatography on wheat germ lectin-Sepharose. Autoradiography of SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions showed a single radiolabeled band of Mr = 80,000. The radioiodinated receptors treated with peptide:N-glycosidase F migrated at Mr = 54,000. Treatment with neuraminidase alone caused only a minor reduction in molecular weight, and subsequent treatment with endo-alpha-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminidase had little further effect on the receptor. When the radioiodinated receptor was analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography, a single broad peak was eluted with Mr of approximately 350,000. The higher Mr of radioiodinated receptors than that of native receptors (Mr = 190,000 dimeric form) could be due to the aggregation of labeled molecules. These complexes dissociated into the monomeric form in the presence of SDS. To determine whether the monomers can bind hormone, the purified unlabeled receptors resolved with SDS were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with 125I-hCG. Autoradiograms of the blots showed a band of monomer (Mr = 78,000) as well as one of dimer (Mr approximately 150,000). These studies have demonstrated that the luteinizing hormone/hCG receptors are predominantly N-linked glycosylated and suggest that the native receptor is a dimer of identical hormone binding subunits associated by noncovalent interactions. Although the individual subunits can bind hormone, it is conceivable that the dimeric form is necessary for signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1591157154,"Studies were conducted to explore in rats the role of retinol in the regulation of the synthesis and secretion of retinol-binding protein (RBP) by the visceral yolk sac compared to the liver. Previous studies have shown that in retinol deficiency, hepatic RBP secretion is specifically inhibited, whereas hepatic RBP synthesis rate is unchanged. Retinol-depleted, retinoic acid-supplemented female rats were mated, and maternal liver, fetal liver, and visceral yolk sac were obtained at 14 days of gestation (retinol-depleted group). A group of identically treated, retinol-depleted rats were repleted with retinol on the 14th day of gestation, and the same tissues were collected 6 h later (retinol-repleted group). Normal female rats were used as controls. RBP was assayed by radioimmunoassay and RBP mRNA levels by RNase protection assay using a rat RBP cDNA clone. RBP levels in the visceral yolk sac were elevated 10-fold in the retinol-depleted as compared to the control rats and had declined to near normal values in the retinol-repleted animals. The relative levels of RBP mRNA in the visceral yolk sac were very similar in all three groups of rats. Thus, as in the liver, in the visceral yolk sac retinol deficiency inhibits RBP secretion without altering RBP mRNA levels. In the visceral yolk sac, as in the liver, retinol status appears to regulate RBP secretion specifically, without affecting the rate of RBP biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1502624094,"The possibility has been examined that peptidylmethyl sulfonium salts might affinity label proteases by an alkyl transfer from sulfur to an active center residue. The synthesis of a number of agents of this type is described as well as initial results of their effect on cysteinyl proteases, papain and cathepsin B. These are readily inactivated by reagents in which the peptidyl portion contains features that promote binding to the proteases such as a penultimate phenylalanine residue. Irreversible inactivation ensues by transfer of the peptidyl portion, not methyl groups. Peptidylmethyl sulfonium salts lose a proton to form an ylide structure which may be the prevalent form at physiological pH values. The ylide may also be the active affinity labeling form of the reagent since the rate of inactivation of cathepsin B increases with pH. In contrast, the action of another affinity labeling reagent for cathepsin B, benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-AlaCHN2, a diazomethyl ketone, is relatively independent of pH."
https://openalex.org/W1592653162,"The effects of ligands on the structure of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase were studied by small angle neutron scattering. The radius of gyration, RG, decreases by about 1 A in the presence of the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate, but increases by about the same magnitude in the presence of the allosteric inhibitor phenylalanine. With increasing pH or in the absence of Mg2+ and K+, the RG of pyruvate kinase increases. Hence, there is a 2-A difference in RG between two alternative conformations. Length distribution analysis indicates that, under all experimental conditions which increase the radius of gyration, there is a pronounced increase observed in the probability for interatomic distance between 80 and 110 A. These small angle neutron scattering results indicate a contraction and expansion of the enzyme when it transforms between its active and inactive forms. Using the alpha-carbon coordinates of crystalline cat muscle pyruvate kinase, a length distribution profile was calculated, and it matches the scattering profile of the inactive form. These observations are expected since the crystals were grown in the absence of divalent cations (Stuart, D. I., Levine, M., Muirhead, H., and Stammers, D. K. (1979) J. Mol. Biol. 134, 109-142). Hence, results from neutron scattering, x-ray crystallographic, and sedimentation studies (Oberfelder, R. W., Lee, L. L.-Y., and Lee, J.C. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 3813-3821) are totally consistent with each other. With the aid of computer modeling, the crystal structure has been manipulated in order to effect changes that are consistent with the conformational change described by the solution scattering data. The structural manipulation involves the rotation of the B domain relative to the A domain, leading to the closure of the cleft between these domains. These manipulations resulted in the generation of new sets of atomic (C-alpha) coordinates, which were utilized in calculations, the result of which compared favorably with the solution data."
https://openalex.org/W1510784632,"The regulation of bile acid synthesis was studied in rabbits after interruption of the enterohepatic circulation by choledochoureteral anastomosis. Total daily bile acid output was 772 +/- 130 (SD) mumol/24 h, of which greater than 95% was glycocholic acid. Administration of deoxycholic or cholic acid or their conjugates (300-800 mumol) or gall-bladder bile failed to down-regulate endogenous bile acid synthesis. In contrast, chenodeoxycholic acid administration did down-regulate bile acid synthesis, but this effect was related to the formation and excretion of lithocholic acid. This observation was confirmed by the finding that i.v. infusion of 10-20 mumol of either lithocholic acid or 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid significantly reduced cholic acid synthesis. Thus monohydroxy bile acids, derived from either hepatic or intestinal sources, participate in the down-regulation of bile acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1489149251,"Conducting airway epithelial cells requires vitamin A or its synthetic chemicals (retinoids) for their survival and for the expression of normal mucociliary functions. By using molecular cloning, we have shown that one of the effects of retinol on cultured human tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells is the enhancement (from 2- to 4-fold) of the mRNA encoding the elongation factor EF-1 alpha. Sequence analysis has shown that clone HT7, which was identified by differential hybridization procedures, contained a cDNA insert which encoded a protein closely resembling (81%) elongation factor EF-1 alpha from brine shrimp and completely identical to the published sequence of human elongation factor EF-1 alpha (Brands, H.H.G.M., Maassen, J.A., Van Hemert, F.J., Amons, R., and Moller, W. (1986) Eur. J. Biochem. 155, 167-171). Regions of homology of HT7 to EF-Tu from yeast mitochondria, plant chloroplasts, and Escherichia coli are also evident. A single RNA band at 1700 bases was observed for both untreated and retinol-treated HTBE cells, and for mouse liver and parotid glands when Northern transfer from denaturing agarose gel was probed with a 32P-labeled HT7 insert. An enhanced amino acid incorporation and increased protein content per cell for HTBE cells grown in the presence of retinol were observed. Results presented by these studies indicate that retinol may regulate the transcription of a factor required for translation."

https://openalex.org/W1565187280,"L-Cysteinesulfonate (L-cysteate) is present in plasma, urine, and tissues in concentrations comparable to that of L-cysteinesulfinate, the primary oxidative metabolite of L-cysteine. Although cysteinesulfonate is known to be decarboxylated to taurine by cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase, the occurrence and importance of other metabolisms has not been examined. The present studies indicate that cysteinesulfonate partitions in vivo between decarboxylation and transamination; the latter reaction is catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase and yields beta-sulfopyruvate. Whereas beta-sulfinylpyruvate, the product of cysteinesulfinate transamination, decomposes spontaneously, beta-sulfopyruvate is stable and is reduced by malate dehydrogenase to beta-sulfolactate. When L-[1-14C]cysteinesulfonate is given to mice, 60-75% is decarboxylated to taurine and about 25% is excreted in the urine as beta-sulfolactate. beta-Sulfo[1-14C] pyruvate is found to partition about equally between beta-sulfolactate and cysteinesulfonate formation; greater than 90% of the latter is decarboxylated. Parenterally administered beta-sulfo[1-14C]lactate is mostly excreted in the urine, but 12% is metabolized via beta-sulfopyruvate and cysteinesulfonate to 14CO2 and taurine. beta-Sulfopyruvate is not excreted, and only traces of sulfoacetate, perhaps formed by oxidative decarboxylation, are detected. These studies establish that cysteinesulfonate, beta-sulfopyruvate, and beta-sulfolactate are reversibly interconverted in vivo. Since only cysteinesulfonate is directly metabolized to CO2, the rate of 14CO2 formation from L-[1-14C]cysteinesulfonate is a valid measure of total cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase activity in vivo; use of this assay permits inhibitor effects to be accurately determined in intact mice. Thus, whereas in vitro assays indicate that beta-methyleneaspartate inhibits brain, liver, and kidney cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase by 0, greater than 60, and 90%, respectively, in vivo studies with L-[1-14C]cysteinesulfonate show net metabolic inhibition is about 40%."
https://openalex.org/W1579288022,"The binding of estradiol to uterine cytosoluble receptors from 24-day-old rats was reduced or potentiated by unsaturated fatty acids (NEFAs), depending on the concentrations of estradiol and unsaturated NEFAs. At estradiol concentrations of up to 1.5 x 10(-8) M, unsaturated NEFAs inhibited estradiol binding to the 8 S cytosol receptor. This inhibition was dose-dependent (10-70%, p less than 0.001) and a function of NEFA unsaturation. Scatchard analysis indicated that unsaturated NEFAs caused a large decrease in receptor affinity for estradiol. Polyunsaturated NEFAs had no apparent effect on estradiol binding at estradiol concentrations of 2-4 x 10(-8) M. At high estradiol concentrations (above 4 x 10(-8) M), estradiol binding was increased 130-250% (p less than 0.01) by polyunsaturated NEFAs. This increased binding was particularly associated with proteins sedimenting at 12.5 S and the 8 S binding was, in fact, reduced. Metabolic studies showed that the reduced binding in the presence of unsaturated fatty acids was correlated with a decrease in reversibly bound estradiol at low estradiol concentrations. The increase in estradiol binding at high estradiol concentrations is the result of a reduction in reversibly bound estradiol and an increase in nonorganic solvent-extractable (water-soluble) estradiol. The amounts of these water-soluble estradiol derivatives depended on both estradiol and unsaturated NEFA concentrations. 70% of the water-soluble estradiol derivatives were trichloroacetic acid-precipitable, suggesting a covalent protein-steroid link. Thus, changes in the hydrophobic fatty acid environment of the uterine cytosol estrogen receptor could modify estrogen-receptor function by altering binding site conformation and/or by inducing changes in estradiol metabolism."

Chem. 257, 15105-15109), we have labeled calf terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) with [32P]dTTP. The specificity of dTTP cross-linking at the substrate binding site in TdT is demonstrated by the competitive inhibition of the cross-linking reaction by other deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and ATP and its analogues, requiring concentrations consistent with their kinetic constants. Tryptic peptide mapping of the [32P]dTTP-labeled enzyme showed the presence of a single radioactive peptide fraction that contained the site of dTTP cross-linking. The amino acid composition and sequence analysis of the radioactive peptide fraction revealed it to contain two tryptic peptides, spanning residues 221-231 and 234-249. Since these two peptides were covalently linked to dTTP, the region encompassed by them constitutes a substrate binding domain in TdT. Further proteolytic digestion of the tryptic peptide-dTTP complex, using V8 protease, yielded a smaller peptide, and its analysis narrowed the substrate binding domain to 14 amino acids corresponding to residues 224-237 in the primary amino acid sequence of TdT. Furthermore, 2 cysteine residues, Cys-227 and Cys-234, within this domain were found to be involved in the cross-linking of dTTP, suggesting their participation in the process of substrate binding in TdT."

https://openalex.org/W1605641841,"The specific binding of soluble 125I-labeled human plasma fibronectin (125I-HFN-P) to confluent cultures of early and late passage human skin fibroblasts was investigated. Previous studies of HFN-P bound to fibroblast cell layers indicated that HFN-P was present in the cultures in two separate pools, distinguishable on the basis of their solubility in 1% deoxycholate. Pool I contained deoxycholate-soluble fibronectin (cell-associated), whereas Pool II contained deoxycholate-insoluble fibronectin (matrix-associated). Time course studies indicated that HFN-P was initially incorporated into Pool I and then accumulated into Pool II (McKeown-Longo, P.J., and Mosher, D.F. (1983) J. Cell Biol. 97, 466-472). Examination of the kinetics of 125I-HFN-P binding to Pool I of early and late passage cultures revealed that both cultures required 2-4 h to approach steady-state conditions. Other kinetic studies showed that the rates of loss of 125I-HFN-P from either Pool I or Pool II were similar for both cultures. However, the late passage cultures bound greater than twice as much fibronectin into Pool I, per cell, than the early passage cultures. This difference was not related to a difference in the level of endogenously produced fibronectins accumulating in the medium. Late passage cultures incorporated 125I-HFN-P into the deoxycholate-insoluble Pool at an average rate 2.6 times greater than early passage cultures. The late passage cultures also chased a greater percent of their Pool I-bound fibronectin into Pool II and a lower percent into the chase medium. These results indicate that early and late passage cultures of human fibroblasts exhibit differences in the binding of soluble fibronectin and in the extent to which they incorporate soluble fibronectin into the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2152419950,"Administration of estradiol-17 beta to male Xenopus laevis induces the hepatic mRNA coding for the serum retinol binding protein (RBP) approximately 10-fold, both in vivo and in primary liver cultures. Estrogen induction of RBP mRNA is completely blocked by the anti-estrogen, hydroxytamoxifen. Testosterone administration reduces the elevated level of RBP mRNA observed in livers of female X. laevis to the constitutive level seen in livers of control male animals, and partially blocks the estrogen induction of RBP mRNA. Intracellular RBP mRNA levels therefore represent a balance between the opposing effects of estradiol-17 beta and testosterone. In marked contrast to the estrogen induction of vitellogenin mRNA, which requires the continuous presence of exogenous estrogen, induction of RBP mRNA persists for at least 4 months after a single injection of estrogen. Runoff transcription measurements demonstrate that persistent induction of RBP mRNA is due to an increased rate of RBP gene transcription. Administration of hydroxytamoxifen abolishes persistent induction of RBP mRNA, suggesting that residual hormone receptor complex plays a role in the persistent induction of RBP gene transcription. The persistent estrogen induction of RBP mRNA provides the first demonstration of long-term activation of the transcription of a hormone-responsive gene in response to a transient dose of a steroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1584584854,"Abstract Previous studies from several laboratories have shown that thrombin is inactivated by tetranitromethane with the formation of nitrotyrosine. The inactivation is characterized by an apparently greater loss of fibrinogen-clotting activity than activity toward synthetic ester substrates, suggesting that the residues modified by tetranitromethane are involved in the interaction of thrombin with fibrinogen. This study was designed 1) to determine the effect of solvent conditions on the rate of modification and the stoichiometry of the reaction of tetranitromethane with bovine alpha-thrombin; 2) to identify the residue(s) modified; and 3) to characterize the modified enzyme with respect to its interaction with peptide nitroanilide substrates and fibrinogen. The inactivation of thrombin by tetranitromethane proceeded more rapidly in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, than in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0. Approximately 10% fibrinogen-clotting activity remained at maximal inactivation. A study of the effect of tetranitromethane concentration on the rate of inactivation suggested that the loss of activity was the result of the modification of 1 mol of tyrosine/mol of thrombin. A similar result was obtained from the analysis of the extent of inactivation as a function of the extent of protein modification. Structural analysis of the modified protein showed substantial modification at both Tyr71 and Tyr85. Enzyme kinetic studies were performed with the modified protein and a control thrombin with N2-tosylglycylprolylarginine p-nitroanilide. H-D-phenylalanylpipecolylarginine p-nitronailide, and purified bovine fibrinogen. With all three substrates, a substantial decrease in kcat was observed, whereas there was essentially no change in Km. These results suggest that, contrary to previous suggestions, the modification of Tyr71 and Tyr85 in thrombin does not influence the binding of substrates, but rather influences active site reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1847593871,"Crystallographic analysis of the binding of mercaptoacetyl-L-valyl-L-tryptophan to thermolysin suggests that this inhibitor is hydrolyzed by the crystalline enzyme. The apparent product of hydrolysis, L-valyl-L-tryptophan (Val-Trp), occupies the S1'-S2' subsites of the active site, not the S1-S1' subsites as observed previously for the dipeptide L-alanyl-L-phenylalanine (Ala-Phe). The difference in binding of Val-Trp and Ala-Phe is consistent with the specificity requirements and preferences of thermolysin. The binding of Val-Trp illustrates the mode of interaction of one of the products of peptide hydrolysis. High resolution crystallographic refinement indicates that the valyl amino group makes three hydrogen bonds to the enzyme and to solvent and, in addition, is 2.8 A from the carboxylate of Glu-143. This is the first instance in which a direct interaction has been observed between Glu-143 and the scissile nitrogen. As such, the study directly supports the mechanism of action for thermolysin proposed by Hangauer et al. (Hangauer, D. G., Monzingo, A. F., and Matthews, B. W. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 5730-5741) and, by analogy, indirectly supports the similar mechanism proposed for carboxypeptidase A (Monzingo, A. F., and Matthews, B. W. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 5724-5729)."
https://openalex.org/W1563372804,"A membrane preparation from the testis of maturing Dorset-Leicester-Suffolk sheep, capable of discriminating pituitary LH (lutropin) from placental gonadotropins human choriogonadotropin (hCG) and equine choriogonadotropin is described. Maximum binding of 125I-oLH (ovine lutropin) to the testicular receptors occurred at 4 degrees C in a rapid manner, attaining equilibrium in 12-16 h. Under such optimal conditions, only unlabeled ovine LH or the structurally identical bovine LH effectively competed for receptor occupation. Other highly purified pituitary LH preparations from rat and human pituitaries were weakly (4-10%) active in displacement assays. Purified hCG or equine choriogonadotropin, which were highly potent in rat testicular LH receptor assays, could not compete with 125I-oLH for binding to the sheep LH receptor at 4 degrees C. Thus, the sheep testicular LH receptor was highly specific in recognizing pituitary LH conformation. The presence of an ovine/bovine LH alpha- or beta-subunit in recombinants with hCG subunit counterparts was required to generate an effective conformation capable of receptor recognition. Chemically deglycosylated hCG, containing 75% less carbohydrate and which showed greater binding to other LH receptors, failed to recognize sheep LH receptor, suggesting that excess carbohydrate in hCG was not a factor in hindering binding of the native placental hormone. Scatchard analysis using 125I-hCG/125I-oLH revealed that there were separate sites with similar affinities but vastly different capacities. The hCG binding sites, which could also be effectively occupied by oLH, were less than 10% of oLH binding sites. Thus, the Dorset-Leicester-Suffolk sheep testicular receptor provides an important and unique in vitro test system to distinguish pituitary LH from placental LH-like hormones. We infer that temperature-dependent conformational restrictions of the sheep testicular LH receptor are involved in recognizing differences in these highly similar and structurally homologous hormones."
