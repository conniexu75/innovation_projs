https://openalex.org/W4306181817,"Neuroepithelial crosstalk is critical for gut physiology. However, the mechanisms by which sensory neurons communicate with epithelial cells to mediate gut barrier protection at homeostasis and during inflammation are not well understood. Here, we find that Nav1.8+CGRP+ nociceptor neurons are juxtaposed with and signal to intestinal goblet cells to drive mucus secretion and gut protection. Nociceptor ablation led to decreased mucus thickness and dysbiosis, while chemogenetic nociceptor activation or capsaicin treatment induced mucus growth. Mouse and human goblet cells expressed Ramp1, receptor for the neuropeptide CGRP. Nociceptors signal via the CGRP-Ramp1 pathway to induce rapid goblet cell emptying and mucus secretion. Notably, commensal microbes activated nociceptors to control homeostatic CGRP release. In the absence of nociceptors or epithelial Ramp1, mice showed increased epithelial stress and susceptibility to colitis. Conversely, CGRP administration protected nociceptor-ablated mice against colitis. Our findings demonstrate a neuron-goblet cell axis that orchestrates gut mucosal barrier protection."
https://openalex.org/W4306149992,"Nociceptive pain is a hallmark of many chronic inflammatory conditions including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs); however, whether pain-sensing neurons influence intestinal inflammation remains poorly defined. Employing chemogenetic silencing, adenoviral-mediated colon-specific silencing, and pharmacological ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors, we observed more severe inflammation and defective tissue-protective reparative processes in a murine model of intestinal damage and inflammation. Disrupted nociception led to significant alterations in the intestinal microbiota and a transmissible dysbiosis, while mono-colonization of germ-free mice with Gram+ Clostridium spp. promoted intestinal tissue protection through a nociceptor-dependent pathway. Mechanistically, disruption of nociception resulted in decreased levels of substance P, and therapeutic delivery of substance P promoted tissue-protective effects exerted by TRPV1+ nociceptors in a microbiota-dependent manner. Finally, dysregulated nociceptor gene expression was observed in intestinal biopsies from IBD patients. Collectively, these findings indicate an evolutionarily conserved functional link between nociception, the intestinal microbiota, and the restoration of intestinal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4305016438,"Ambient RNA contamination in single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) is a significant problem, but its consequences are poorly understood. Here, we show that ambient RNAs in brain snRNA-seq datasets have a nuclear or non-nuclear origin with distinct gene set signatures. Both ambient RNA signatures are predominantly neuronal, and we find that some previously annotated neuronal cell types are distinguished by ambient RNA contamination. We detect pervasive neuronal ambient RNA contamination in all glial cell types unless glia and neurons are physically separated prior to sequencing. We demonstrate that this contamination can be removed in silico and show that previous single-nuclei RNA-seq-based annotations of immature oligodendrocytes are glial nuclei contaminated with ambient RNAs. After ambient RNA removal, we detect rare, committed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells not annotated in most previous adult human brain datasets. Together, these results provide an in-depth analysis of ambient RNA contamination in brain single-nuclei datasets."

https://openalex.org/W4306663576,"Abstract In eukaryotes, CREB‐binding protein (CBP), a coactivator of CREB, functions both as a platform for recruiting other components of the transcriptional machinery and as a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that alters chromatin structure. We previously showed that the transcriptional activity of cAMP‐responsive element binding protein (CREB) plays a crucial role in neuronal plasticity in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis . However, there is no information on the molecular structure and HAT activity of CBP in the Lymnaea central nervous system (CNS), hindering an investigation of its postulated role in long‐term memory (LTM). Here, we characterize the Lymnaea CBP (LymCBP) gene and identify a conserved domain of LymCBP as a functional HAT. Like CBPs of other species, LymCBP possesses functional domains, such as the KIX domain, which is essential for interaction with CREB and was shown to regulate LTM. In‐situ hybridization showed that the staining patterns of LymCBP mRNA in CNS are very similar to those of Lymnaea CREB1. A particularly strong LymCBP mRNA signal was observed in the cerebral giant cell (CGC), an identified extrinsic modulatory interneuron of the feeding circuit, the key to both appetitive and aversive LTM for taste. Biochemical experiments using the recombinant protein of the LymCBP HAT domain showed that its enzymatic activity was blocked by classical HAT inhibitors. Preincubation of the CNS with such inhibitors blocked cAMP‐induced synaptic facilitation between the CGC and an identified follower motoneuron of the feeding system. Taken together, our findings suggest a role for the HAT activity of LymCBP in synaptic plasticity in the feeding circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W4305013886,"The role of the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) in working memory (WM) is debated. Non-human primate (NHP) electrophysiology shows that the lPFC stores WM representations, but human neuroimaging suggests that the lPFC controls WM content in sensory cortices. These accounts are confounded by differences in task training and stimulus exposure. We tested whether long-term training alters lPFC function by densely sampling WM activity using functional MRI. Over 3 months, participants trained on both a WM and serial reaction time (SRT) task, wherein fractal stimuli were embedded within sequences. WM performance improved for trained (but not novel) fractals and, neurally, delay activity increased in distributed lPFC voxels across learning. Item-level WM representations became detectable within lPFC patterns, and lPFC activity reflected sequence relationships from the SRT task. These findings demonstrate that human lPFC develops stimulus-selective responses with learning, and WM representations are shaped by long-term experience, which could reconcile competing accounts of WM functioning."

https://openalex.org/W4306167690,"Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor latrophilin 3 (ADGRL3), a cell adhesion molecule highly expressed in the central nervous system, acts in synapse formation through trans interactions with its ligands. It is largely unknown if these interactions serve a purely adhesive function or can modulate G protein signaling. To assess how different structural elements of ADGRL3 (e.g., the adhesive domains, autoproteolytic cleavage site, or tethered agonist (TA)) impact receptor function, we require constructs that disrupt specific receptor features without impacting others. While we showed previously that mutating conserved Phe and Met residues in the TA of ADGRL3-C-terminal fragment (CTF), a CTF truncated to the G protein-coupled receptor proteolysis site, abolishes receptor-mediated G protein activation, we now find that autoproteolytic cleavage is disrupted in the full-length version of this construct. To identify a construct that disrupts TA-dependent activity without impacting proteolysis, we explored other mutations in the TA. We found that mutating the sixth and seventh residues of the TA, Leu and Met, to Ala impaired activity in a serum response element activity assay for both full-length and CTF constructs. We confirmed this activity loss results from impaired G protein coupling using an assay that acutely exposes the TA through controlled proteolysis. The ADGRL3 mutant expresses normally at the cell surface, and immunoblotting shows that it undergoes normal autoproteolysis. Thus, we found a construct that disrupts tethered agonism while retaining autoproteolytic cleavage, providing a tool to disentangle these functions in vivo. Our approach and specific findings are likely to be broadly applicable to other adhesion receptors."
https://openalex.org/W4306179888,"Cerebral white matter undergoes a rapid and complex maturation during the early postnatal period. Prior magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of early postnatal development have often been limited by small sample size, single-modality imaging, and univariate analytics. Here, we applied nonnegative matrix factorization, an unsupervised multivariate pattern analysis technique, to T2w/T1w signal ratio maps from the Developing Human Connectome Project (n = 342 newborns) revealing patterns of coordinated white matter maturation. These patterns showed divergent age-related maturational trajectories, which were replicated in another independent cohort (n = 239). Furthermore, we showed that T2w/T1w signal variations in these maturational patterns are explained by differential contributions of white matter microstructural indices derived from diffusion-weighted MRI. Finally, we demonstrated how white matter maturation patterns relate to distinct histological features by comparing our findings with postmortem late fetal/early postnatal brain tissue staining. Together, these results delineate concise and effective representation of early postnatal white matter reorganization."

https://openalex.org/W4304889335,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 dramatically alters the architecture and protein composition of cellular membranes during infection, but its effects upon membrane lipid composition remain unclear. HSV-1 pUL21 is a virus-encoded protein phosphatase adaptor that promotes dephosphorylation of multiple cellular and virus proteins, including the cellular ceramide (Cer) transport protein CERT. CERT mediates nonvesicular Cer transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network, whereupon Cer is converted to sphingomyelin (SM) and other sphingolipids that play important roles in cellular proliferation, signaling, and membrane trafficking. Here, we use click chemistry to profile the kinetics of sphingolipid metabolism, showing that pUL21-mediated dephosphorylation activates CERT and accelerates Cer-to-SM conversion. Purified pUL21 and full-length CERT interact with submicromolar affinity, and we solve the solution structure of the pUL21 C-terminal domain in complex with the CERT Pleckstrin homology and steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer domains using small-angle X-ray scattering. We identify a single amino acid mutation on the surface of pUL21 that disrupts CERT binding in vitro and in cultured cells. This residue is highly conserved across the genus Simplexvirus. In addition, we identify a pUL21 residue essential for binding to HSV-1 pUL16. Sphingolipid profiling demonstrates that Cer-to-SM conversion is severely diminished in the context of HSV-1 infection, a defect that is compounded when infecting with a virus encoding the mutated form of pUL21 that lacks the ability to activate CERT. However, virus replication and spread in cultured keratinocytes or epithelial cells is not significantly altered when pUL21-mediated CERT dephosphorylation is abolished. Collectively, we demonstrate that HSV-1 modifies sphingolipid metabolism via specific protein-protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W4306410232,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a group of fatal malignancies characterized by high metastatic capacity, the underlying mechanisms of which remain largely elusive. We have found here that insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) is highly expressed in TNBC and correlates clinically with distant metastasis-free survival of TNBC patients. IGF2BP3 promotes the migration and invasion capabilities of TNBC cells dependent upon cellular RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. Mechanistically, IGF2BP3 binds to and destabilizes m6A–methylated mRNA of the extracellular matrix glycoprotein, SLIT2, impairs its downstream signaling via the cognate receptor ROBO1, and consequently triggers the activation of canonical PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways. The IGF2BP3/SLIT2 axis is critically involved in the regulation of TNBC metastasis in vivo. These findings shed light into the regulatory network of distant metastasis of breast cancer and provide rationale for targeting the m6A machinery in the treatment of TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W4306630473,"Background The administration of a third (booster) dose of COVID-19 vaccines in Peru initially employed the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) mRNA vaccine. The national vaccination program started with healthcare workers (HCW) who received BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm) vaccine as primary regimen and elderly people previously immunized with BNT162b2. This study evaluated the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the “booster” dose in these two groups in Lima, Peru. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study, recruiting participants from November to December of 2021 in Lima, Peru. We evaluated immunogenicity and reactogenicity in HCW and elderly patients previously vaccinated with either two doses of BBIBP-CorV (heterologous regimen) or BTN162b2 (homologous regimen). Immunogenicity was measured by anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels immediately before boosting dose and 14 days later. IgG geometric means (GM) and medians were obtained, and modeled using ANCOVA and quantile regressions. Results The GM of IgG levels increased significantly after boosting: from 28.5±5.0 AU/mL up to 486.6±1.2 AU/mL (p&lt;0.001) which corresponds to a 17-fold increase. The heterologous vaccine regimen produced higher GM of post-booster anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, eliciting a 13% increase in the geometric mean ratio (95%CI: 1.02–1.27) and a median difference of 92.3 AU/ml (95%CI: 24.9–159.7). Both vaccine regimens were safe and well tolerated. Previous COVID-19 infection was also associated with higher pre and post-booster IgG GM levels. Conclusion Although both boosting regimens were highly immunogenic, two doses of BBIBP-CorV boosted with BTN162b2 produced a stronger IgG antibody response than the homologous BNT162b2 regimen in the Peruvian population. Additionally, both regimens were mildly reactogenic and well-tolerated."
https://openalex.org/W4306155068,"Behavioral states can influence performance of goal-directed sensorimotor tasks. Yet, it is unclear how altered neuronal sensory representations in these states relate to task performance and learning. We trained water-restricted mice in a two-whisker discrimination task to study cortical circuits underlying perceptual decision-making under different levels of thirst. We identified somatosensory cortices as well as the premotor cortex as part of the circuit necessary for task execution. Two-photon calcium imaging in these areas identified populations selective to sensory or motor events. Analysis of task performance during individual sessions revealed distinct behavioral states induced by decreasing levels of thirst-related motivation. Learning was better explained by improvements in motivational state control rather than sensorimotor association. Whisker sensory representations in the cortex were altered across behavioral states. In particular, whisker stimuli could be better decoded from neuronal activity during high task performance states, suggesting that state-dependent changes of sensory processing influence decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W4306167168,"Enterocin K1 (EntK1), a bacteriocin that is highly potent against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, depends on binding to an intramembrane protease of the site-2 protease family, RseP, for its antimicrobial activity. RseP is highly conserved in both EntK1-sensitive and EntK1-insensitive bacteria, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between RseP and EntK1 and bacteriocin sensitivity are unknown. Here, we describe a mutational study of RseP from EntK1-sensitive Enterococcus faecium to identify regions of RseP involved in bacteriocin binding and activity. Mutational effects were assessed by studying EntK1 sensitivity and binding with strains of naturally EntK1-insensitive Lactiplantibacillus plantarum-expressing various RseP variants. We determined that site-directed mutations in conserved sequence motifs related to catalysis and substrate binding, and even deletion of two such motifs known to be involved in substrate binding, did not abolish bacteriocin sensitivity, with one exception. A mutation of a highly conserved asparagine, Asn359, in the extended so-called LDG motif abolished both binding of and killing by EntK1. By constructing various hybrids of the RseP proteins from sensitive E. faecium and insensitive L. plantarum, we showed that the extracellular PDZ domain is the key determinant of EntK1 sensitivity. Taken together, these data may provide valuable insight for guided construction of novel bacteriocins and may contribute to establishing RseP as an antibacterial target."
https://openalex.org/W4306179651,"High-throughput experimental platforms have revolutionized the ability to profile biochemical and functional properties of biological sequences such as DNA, RNA and proteins. By collating several data modalities with customizable tracks rendered using intuitive visualizations, genome browsers enable an interactive and interpretable exploration of diverse types of genome profiling experiments and derived annotations. However, existing genome browser tracks are not well suited for intuitive visualization of high-resolution DNA sequence features such as transcription factor motifs. Typically, motif instances in regulatory DNA sequences are visualized as BED-based annotation tracks, which highlight the genomic coordinates of the motif instances but do not expose their specific sequences. Instead, a genome sequence track needs to be cross-referenced with the BED track to identify sequences of motif hits. Even so, quantitative information about the motif instances such as affinity or conservation as well as differences in base resolution from the consensus motif are not immediately apparent. This makes interpretation slow and challenging. This problem is compounded when analyzing several cellular states and/or molecular readouts (such as ATAC-seq and ChIP–seq) simultaneously, as coordinates of enriched regions (peaks) and the set of active transcription factor motifs vary across cell states."
https://openalex.org/W4306403617,"During tendon healing, macrophages are thought to be a key mediator of scar tissue formation, which prevents successful functional restoration of the tendon. However, macrophages are critical for successful tendon healing as they aid in wound debridement, extracellular matrix deposition, and promote fibroblast proliferation. Recent work has sought to better define the multi-faceted functions of macrophages using depletion studies, while other studies have identified a tendon resident macrophage population. To begin to delineate the functions of tendon-resident versus circulation-derived macrophages, we examined the tendon healing phenotype in Chemokine Receptor 2 (CCR2) reporter (CCR2GFP/+), and knockout mice. CCR2 is a chemokine receptor primarily found on the surface of circulating bone marrow-derived monocytes, with CCR2 being an important mediator of macrophage recruitment to wound environments. Surprisingly, CCR2GFP/+ cells were present in the tendon during adult homeostasis, and single-cell RNA sequencing identified these cells as tendon-resident macrophages and T cells. During both homeostasis and healing, CCR2 knockout resulted in a substantial decrease in CCR2GFP+ cells and pan-macrophages. Additionally, loss of CCR2 resulted in reduced numbers of myofibroblasts and impeded functional recovery during late healing. This study highlights the heterogeneity of tendon-resident and recruited immune cells and their contributions following injury, and establishes an important role for CCR2 in modulating both the adult tendon cell environment and tendon healing process."
https://openalex.org/W4306409512,"Chronic inflammation is one of the definite factors leading to the occurrence and development of tumors, including prostate cancer (PCa). The androgen receptor (AR) pathway is essential for PCa tumorigenesis and inflammatory response. However, little is known about the AR-regulated NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway in human PCa. In this study, we explored the expression of inflammatory cytokine and AR in high-grade PCa and observed that NLRP3 inflammasome-associated genes were upregulated in high-grade PCa compared with that in low-grade PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia and were associated with AR expression. In addition, we identified circAR-3—a circRNA derived from the AR gene—which is involved in the AR-regulated inflammatory response and cell proliferation by activating the NLRP3 inflammatory pathway. While circAR-3 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and the inflammatory response, its depletion induced opposite effects. Mechanistically, we noted that circAR-3 mediated the acetylation modification of NLRP3 by KAT2B and then promoted NLRP3 inflammasome complex subcellular distribution and assembly. Disturbing NLRP3 acetylation or blocking inflammasome assembly with an inhibitor suppressed the progression of PCa xenograft tumors. Our findings provide the first evidence that targeting NLRP3 acetylation or inflammasome assembly may be effective in inhibiting PCa progression."

We find motor neurons attract vessels with long-range VEGF signaling, but endothelial cells in the axonal pathway are an obstacle for establishing connections with muscles. It is unclear how this paradoxical interference from heterotypic neurovascular contacts is averted. Through a mouse mutagenesis screen, we show that Plexin-D1 receptor is required in endothelial cells for development of neuromuscular connectivity. Motor neurons release Sema3C to elicit short-range repulsion via Plexin-D1, thus displacing endothelial cells that obstruct axon growth. When this signaling pathway is disrupted, epaxial motor neurons are blocked from reaching their muscle targets and concomitantly vascular patterning in the spinal cord is altered. Thus, an integrative system of opposing push-pull cues ensures detrimental axon-endothelial encounters are avoided while enabling vascularization within the nervous system and along peripheral nerves.

https://openalex.org/W4306155136,"The macrophage mannose receptor (MR, CD206) is a transmembrane endocytic lectin receptor, expressed in selected immune and endothelial cells, and is involved in immunity and maintaining homeostasis. Eight of the ten extracellular domains of the MR are C-type lectin domains (CTLDs) which mediate the binding of mannose, fucose, and GlcNAc in a calcium-dependent manner. Previous studies indicated that self-glycosylation of MR regulates its glycan binding. To further explore this structure-function relationship, we studied herein a recombinant version of mouse MR CTLD4-7 fused to human Fc-portion of IgG (MR-Fc). The construct was expressed in different glycosylation-mutant cell lines to study the influence of differential glycosylation on receptor glycan-binding properties. We conducted site-specific N- and O-glycosylation analysis and glycosylation site characterization using mass spectrometry by which several novel O-glycosylation sites were identified in mouse MR and confirmed in human full-length MR. This information guided experiments evaluating the receptor functionality by glycan microarray analysis in combination with glycan-modifying enzymes. Treatment of active MR-Fc with combinations of exoglycosidases, including neuraminidase and galactosidases, resulted in the loss of trans-binding (binding of MR CTLDs to non-MR glycans), due to unmasking of terminal, nonreducing GlcNAc in N-glycans of the MR CTLDs. Regalactosylation of N-glycans rescues mannose binding by MR-Fc. Our results indicate that glycans within the MR CTLDs act as a regulatory switch by masking and unmasking self-ligands, including terminal, nonreducing GlcNAc in N-glycans, which could control MR activity in a tissue- and cell-specific manner or which potentially affect bacterial pathogenesis in an immunomodulatory fashion."
https://openalex.org/W4306168779,"Metastatic tumour progression is facilitated by tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) that enforce pro-tumour mechanisms and suppress immunity. In pulmonary metastases, it is unclear whether TAMs comprise tissue resident or infiltrating, recruited macrophages; and the different expression patterns of these TAMs are not well established. Using the mouse melanoma B16F10 model of experimental pulmonary metastasis, we show that infiltrating macrophages (IM) change their gene expression from an early pro-inflammatory to a later tumour promoting profile as the lesions grow. In contrast, resident alveolar macrophages (AM) maintain expression of crucial pro-inflammatory/anti-tumour genes with time. During metastatic growth, the pool of macrophages, which initially contains mainly alveolar macrophages, increasingly consists of infiltrating macrophages potentially facilitating metastasis progression. Blocking chemokine receptor mediated macrophage infiltration in the lung revealed a prominent role for CCR2 in Ly6C+ pro-inflammatory monocyte/macrophage recruitment during metastasis progression, while inhibition of CCR2 signalling led to increased metastatic colony burden. CCR1 blockade, in contrast, suppressed late phase pro-tumour MR+Ly6C- monocyte/macrophage infiltration accompanied by expansion of the alveolar macrophage compartment and accumulation of NK cells, leading to reduced metastatic burden. These data indicate that IM has greater plasticity and higher phenotypic responsiveness to tumour challenge than AM. A considerable difference is also confirmed between CCR1 and CCR2 with regard to the recruited IM subsets, with CCR1 presenting a potential therapeutic target in pulmonary metastasis from melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W4306168861,"Abstract The PI3K pathway is commonly activated in breast cancer, with PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors used clinically. However, mechanisms that limit or enhance the therapeutic effects of PI3K-AKT inhibitors are poorly understood at a genome-wide level. Parallel CRISPR screens in 3 PTEN-null breast cancer cell lines identified genes mediating resistance to capivasertib (AKT inhibitor) and AZD8186 (PI3Kβ inhibitor). The dominant mechanism causing resistance is reactivated PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling, but not other canonical signalling pathways. Deletion of TSC1/2 conferred resistance to PI3Kβi and AKTi through mTORC1. However, deletion of PIK3R2 and INPPL1 drove specific PI3Kβi resistance through AKT. Conversely deletion of PIK3CA , ERBB2 , ERBB 3 increased PI3Kβi sensitivity while modulation of RRAGC , LAMTOR1 , LAMTOR4 increased AKTi sensitivity. Significantly, we found that Mcl-1 loss enhanced response through rapid apoptosis induction with AKTi and PI3Kβi in both sensitive and drug resistant TSC1/2 null cells. The combination effect was BAK but not BAX dependent. The Mcl-1i + PI3Kβ/AKTi combination was effective across a panel of breast cancer cell lines with PIK3CA and PTEN mutations, and delivered increased anti-tumor benefit in vivo. This study demonstrates that different resistance drivers to PI3Kβi and AKTi converge to reactivate PI3K-AKT or mTOR signalling and combined inhibition of Mcl-1 and PI3K-AKT has potential as a treatment strategy for PI3Kβi/AKTi sensitive and resistant breast tumours."
https://openalex.org/W4306169201,"Most eukaryotic secretory proteins are cotranslationally translocated through Sec61 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Because these proteins have evolved to fold in the ER, their mistargeting is associated with toxicity. Genetic experiments have implicated the ER heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) Hspa13/STCH as involved in processing of nascent secretory proteins. Herein, we evaluate the role of Hspa13 in protein import and the maintenance of cellular proteostasis in human cells, primarily using the human embryonic kidney 293T cell line. We find that Hspa13 interacts primarily with the Sec61 translocon and its associated factors. Hspa13 overexpression inhibits translocation of the secreted protein transthyretin, leading to accumulation and aggregation of immature transthyretin in the cytosol. ATPase-inactive mutants of Hspa13 further inhibit translocation and maturation of secretory proteins. While Hspa13 overexpression inhibits cell growth and ER quality control, we demonstrate that HSPA13 knockout destabilizes proteostasis and increases sensitivity to ER disruption. Thus, we propose that Hspa13 regulates import through the translocon to maintain both ER and cytosolic protein homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W4306409445,"Upon chronic damage to the liver, multiple cytokines stimulate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), causing the alterations of gene expression profiles and thus leading to HSC activation, a key step in liver fibrogenesis. Activated HSCs are the dominant contributors to liver fibrosis. Bromodomain containing protein 4 (BrD4), an important epigenetic reader, was demonstrated to concentrate on hundreds of enhancers associated with genes involved in multiple profibrotic pathways, thereby directing HSC activation and the fibrotic responses. The present studies were designed to examine the effect of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1), the most potent pro-fibrotic cytokine, on BrD4 expression in HSCs and, if so, elucidated the underlying mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. The experiments employed the heterogeneous TGFβ1 knockout (TGFβ1+/−) mice, gene knockdown in vivo, and a model of thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver injury. The results revealed that TGFβ1 enhanced BrD4 expression in HSCs, which was mediated, at least, by Smad3 signaling and early-immediate gene Egr1 (early growth response-1). TGFβ1-induced Smad3 signaling increased Egr1 expression and promoted Egr1 binding to BrD4 promoter at a site around −111 bp, promoting BrD4 expression. Egr1 knockdown reduced BrD4 expression in HSCs in a mouse model of TAA-induced liver injury and lessened liver fibrosis. Double fluorescence staining demonstrated a strong increase in BrD4 expression in activated HSCs in fibrotic areas of the human livers, paralleling the upregulation of p-Smad3 and Egr1. This research suggested novel molecular events underlying the roles of the master pro-fibrotic cytokine TGFβ1 in HSC activation and liver fibrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4306409912,"Abstract Fragile X‐associated premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is among a family of disorders caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat sequence located in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 ( FMR1 ) gene on the X chromosome. Women with FXPOI have a depleted ovarian follicle population, resulting in amenorrhea, hypoestrogenism, and loss of fertility before the age of 40. FXPOI is caused by expansions of the CGG sequence to lengths between 55 and 200 repeats, known as a FMRI premutation, however the mechanism by which the premutation drives disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Two main hypotheses exist, which describe an mRNA toxic gain‐of‐function mechanism or a protein‐based mechanism, where repeat‐associated non‐AUG (RAN) translation results in the production of an abnormal protein, called FMRpolyG. Here, we have developed an in vitro granulosa cell model of the FMR1 premutation by ectopically expressing CGG‐repeat RNA and FMRpolyG protein. We show that expanded CGG‐repeat RNA accumulated in intranuclear RNA structures, and these aggregates were able to cause significant granulosa cell death independent of FMRpolyG expression. Using an innovative RNA pulldown, mass spectrometry‐based approach we have identified proteins that are specifically sequestered by CGG RNA aggregates in granulosa cells in vitro, and thus may be deregulated as consequence of this interaction. Furthermore, we have demonstrated reduced expression of three proteins identified via our RNA pulldown (FUS, PA2G4 and TRA2β) in ovarian follicles in a FMR1 premutation mouse model. Collectively, these data provide evidence for the contribution of an mRNA gain‐of‐function mechanism to FXPOI disease biology."
https://openalex.org/W4306630437,"Mastitis is a most common disease of dairy cows and causes tremendous economic loss to the dairy industry worldwide. Somatic cell counts (SCC) reflect the inflammatory response to infections and is a metric used as key indicator in mastitis screening programs, typically within the framework of national milk recording schemes. Besides the determination of total SCC, the differentiation of cell types has been described to be beneficial for a more definite description of the actual udder health status of dairy cows. Differential somatic cell count (DSCC) represents the combined proportion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and lymphocytes expressed as a percentage of the total. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between SCC and differential somatic cell count (DSCC) in individual quarter milk samples collected at different time points: at dry-off, after calving and at the lactation peak. We used individual quarter data from farms representing the specialized production system of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese in Northern Italy. Average DSCC values ranged between 44.9% and 56.3%, with higher values (60.4%-72.1%) in milk samples with ≥ 1 million SCC/ml (where the proportion of samples with DSCC > 70% can be as high as 0.73). Moderate overall correlations between DSCC and log(SCC) were estimated (Pearson = 0.42, Spearman = 0.38), with a clear increasing trend with parity and around the lactation peak (e.g. Pearson = 0.59 at 60 DIM in parity 4). Taking SCC values as indicators of subclinical mastitis, DSCC would diagnose mastitis with 0.75 accuracy. Data editing criteria do have an impact on results, with stricter filtering leading to lower correlations between log(SCC) and DSCC. In conclusion DSCC and SCC provide different descriptions of the udder health status of dairy cows which, at least to some extent, are independent. DSCC alone doesn't provide more accurate information than SCC at quarter level but, used in combination with SCC, can be of potential interest within the framework of milk recording programs, especially in the context of selective dry-cow therapy (SDCT). However, this needs further investigation and updated threshold values need to be selected and validated."
https://openalex.org/W4306663862,"Cell heterogeneity has impeded the accurate interpretation of the bulk transcriptome data from patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). We performed an analysis by integrating bulk and single-cell transcriptome datasets to uncover novel mechanisms leading to DN, especially in the podocytes. Microdissected glomeruli and tubules transcriptome datasets were selected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Then the consistency between datasets was evaluated. The analysis of the bulk dataset and single-nucleus RNA dataset was integrated to reveal the cell type-specific responses to DN. The candidate genes were validated in kidney tissues from DN patients and diabetic mice. We compared 4 glomerular and 4 tubular datasets and found considerable discrepancies among datasets regarding the deferentially expressed genes (DEGs), involved signaling pathways, and the hallmark enrichment profiles. Deconvolution of the bulk data revealed that the variations in cell-type proportion contributed greatly to this discrepancy. The integrative analysis uncovered that the dysregulation of spermatogenesis-related genes, including TEKT2 and PIAS2, was involved in the development of DN. Importantly, the mRNA level of TEKT2 was negatively correlated with the mRNA levels of NPHS1 (r = −.66, p < .0001) and NPHS2 (r = −.85, p < .0001) in human diabetic glomeruli. Immunostaining confirmed that the expression of TEKT2 and PIAS2 were up-regulated in podocytes of DN patients and diabetic mice. Knocking down TEKT2 resisted high glucose-induced cytoskeletal remodeling and down-regulation of NPHS1 protein in the cultured podocyte. In conclusion, the integrative strategy can help us efficiently use the publicly available transcriptomics resources. Using this approach and combining it with classical research methods, we identified TEKT2 and PIAS2, two spermatogenesis-related genes involved in the pathogenesis of DN. Furthermore, TEKT2 is involved in this pathogenesis by regulating the podocyte cytoskeleton."

Here, we demonstrated that CD44v10 promotes stemness and chemoresistance of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) individually. Next, we identified that genes differentially expressed in response to ectopic expression of CD44v10 are mostly related to glycolysis. Further, we showed that CD44v10 upregulates glucose transporter 1 to facilitate glycolysis by activating the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. This glycolytic reprogramming induced by CD44v10 contributes to the stem-like properties of TNBC cells and confers resistance to paclitaxel treatment. Notably, we determined that the knockdown of glucose transporter 1 could attenuate the enhanced effects of CD44v10 on glycolysis, stemness, and paclitaxel resistance. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the function of CD44v10 in TNBCs and suggest that targeting CD44v10 may contribute to future clinical therapy.

Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the function of CD44v10 in TNBCs and suggest that targeting CD44v10 may contribute to future clinical therapy. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal subtype of breast cancers (BrCas), in which the higher frequency of cancer stem cells (CSCs) correlates with a dismal prognosis. Despite the current standard cure modalities, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, most TNBC patients inevitably suffer from drug resistance and tumor recurrence. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular basis for TNBC progression is urgently needed to discover new and more effective therapeutic targets for patients. CD44 is a major adhesion molecule and has been implicated in various biological behaviors, such as cell differentiation and cell motility, as well as tumor growth and metastasis (1Zöller M.

CD44: from adhesion molecules to signalling regulators.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar). The human CD44 gene consists of 19 exons and undergoes extensive alternative splicing that generates two families of isoforms, the standard CD44 form (CD44s) and the variant CD44 isoforms (CD44v). In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of CD44s, CD44v, which contains one or more variant exons, seems to be restricted to subpopulations endowed with stem cell potential and tumor development. Among CD44v, CD44v10-containing isoforms encompass a group of isoforms, such as CD44v8-10, CD44v3-10, and CD44v2-10, which have been identified as the most abundant variants (2Ponta H. Sherman L.

It has also been reported that CD44v10-containing isoforms are involved in regulating metastasis, stemness, and chemoresistance of several cancers (4Bourguignon L.Y. Gunja-Smith Z. Iida N. Zhu H.B.

Blockade of CD44v10 could downregulate the expressions of all isoforms containing exon-v10 and consequently delay tumor growth and metastasis (7Guo Q. Liu Y. He Y. Du Y. Zhang G.

Therefore, targeting CD44v10-positive cancer cells arises as a promising cancer therapy option. However, the question of whether it is CD44v10 alone or CD44v10 cooperates with its related isoforms together that influences cancer behaviors remains unanswered. In this study, we first demonstrated that CD44v10 is preferentially expressed in TNBC patients and correlates with tumor progression. Next, we generated a breast cancer cell line transfected with CD44v10 cDNA and identified that glycolysis-related genes were significantly upregulated in response to CD44v10 overexpression. As reported before, abnormal glycolysis metabolism is usually adopted by CSCs, such as glucose uptake, glycolytic enzyme expression, and lactate production which are elevated in CSCs as compared with their differentiated offspring (10Sancho P.

Moreover, certain CD44v isoforms, such as CD44v3, CD44v6, and CD44v8-10, could act as CSCs markers and play critical roles in promoting the properties of CSCs (5Lau W.M. Teng E. Chong H.S. Lopez K.A.

These findings raise the possibility that CD44v10 may be involved in regulating the stem-like features. We next performed transcriptomic analysis and determined that CD44v10 enhances glycolysis through glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) upregulation, which could maintain TNBC cells stem-like properties and confer paclitaxel (PTX) resistance. Notably, silencing of GLUT1 could markedly suppress the enhanced effects of CD44v10 on glycolysis and stem-like properties. Taken together, our findings suggested that CD44v10 could promote BrCas stemness individually without cooperating with other CD44 variants. The underneath mechanism of CD44v10-GLUT1 may point to CD44v10 as a specific therapeutic target to the clinic in TNBC. To investigate the potential role of CD44v10 in BrCas, we first analyzed its expression in a cohort of 25 paired BrCas tissues. The results of immunohistochemical staining showed that CD44v10 levels were dramatically elevated in cancer tissues than adjacent noncancerous tissues (Fig. 1A). Next, to identify the correlation between CD44v10 and BrCas heterogeneity, we detected CD44v10 expressions among distinct molecular subtypes by using another cohort, which contains 30 cases of luminal BrCas, 13 cases of BrCas with HER2 overexpression, and 28 cases of TNBCs. Our results revealed that CD44v10 expression was significantly elevated in TNBCs compared with that in HER2-overexpression and luminal BrCas (Fig. 1B), implicating an important role of CD44v10 in the carcinogenesis of TNBCs. Similar results were obtained by utilizing several human BrCa cell lines showing that CD44v10 expression was higher in four TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, Hs578t, and BT-549) than human normal breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A) (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, we analyzed the correlation between CD44v10 and clinicopathological features in cohort 1 and cohort 2 BrCa patients. We did not find an obvious correlation of CD44v10 expression with age, tumor size, and lymph node status; however, tumors with high CD44v10 expression had higher histopathological grades and more advanced Tumor, Lymph Node, Metastasis stages (Table 1). Moreover, Kaplan–Meier curves were measured in an additional tissue microarray containing 135 human BrCas to identify the correlation between CD44v10 and survival time. The results revealed that BrCas patients with higher expression of CD44v10 showed shorter overall survival time (Fig. S1). Collectively, these data suggested that CD44v10 is preferentially expressed in TNBC patients and may play a vital role in the development of human BrCas.Figure 2Analysis of transcriptional changes upon CD44v10 overexpression.

Our previous study showed that expressions of all isoforms containing exon-v10 were significantly decreased in MDA-MB-231 cells after CD44v10 siRNA transfection (7Guo Q. Liu Y. He Y. Du Y. Zhang G. Yang C. et al.CD44 activation state regulated by the CD44v10 isoform determines breast cancer proliferation.Oncol. Rep. 2021; 45: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In the present study, similar results were obtained by using other TNBC cell lines (BT-549, Hs578t, and MDA-MB-468) (Fig. 2B). To determine the roles of CD44v10 itself in TNBC progression, we established a stable cell line by transfection of CD44v10 cDNA into BT-549 cells which contains little endogenous CD44v10 (Fig. 2C). The global transcriptome profiles in BT-549 cells transduced with vector or CD44v10 were examined by RNA sequencing. Differential expression analysis (fold change >1.5, p < 0.05) highlighted 898 and 1164 genes significantly upregulated and downregulated in BT-549 CD44v10 cells compared with vector samples, respectively (Fig. 2D). Functional annotation revealed that genes upregulated in CD44v10 overexpression cells were significantly enriched for pathways related to glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and angiogenesis (Fig. 2E). To further extend this observation, we applied gene set enrichment analysis and confirmed a significant positive enrichment of glycolysis gene sets in BT-549 CD44v10 group compared with BT-549 vector cells (Fig. 2F). Taken together, our results suggested that CD44v10 may be involved in glycolysis. To validate the RNA sequencing results, we next examined the changes in glycolytic metabolism altered by CD44v10 expression. In addition to BT-549 cells, we also knocked down CD44v10 in MDA-MB-231 cells, which contain a high level of endogenous CD44v10 (Fig. 3A). Given that glycolytic phenotype is characterized by increased glucose consumption and lactate secretion along with reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (16Gao R. Li D. Xun J. Zhou W. Li J. Wang J. et al.CD44ICD promotes breast cancer stemness via PFKFB4-mediated glucose metabolism.Theranostics. 2018; 8: 6248-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we examined whether alteration of CD44v10 expression affects levels of glucose, lactate, and ROS. Our results indicated that ectopic expression of CD44v10 increases glucose consumption and lactate secretion as well as decreases intracellular ROS level, while the knockdown of CD44v10 reverses such effects (Fig. 3, B–D). These findings suggested that CD44v10 could promote the glycolytic processes of TNBC cells. To gain insight into the mechanism by which CD44v10 potentiated TNBC glycolytic phenotypes, the gene expression patterns of key glycolytic enzymes in the glucose metabolic pathway were compared between BT-549 vector and BT-549 CD44v10 overexpression groups. As expected, most of the glycolysis-related genes were upregulated in CD44v10 overexpression cells (Fig. 4A). We further validated these gene expression levels by qPCR assay and selected three candidates (GLUT1, PGK1, and ENO2) that were robustly upregulated upon CD44v10 overexpression (Figs. 4B and S2). Next, the protein expressions of the three genes were detected, and the results showed that GLUT1, the key rate-limiting factor of cellular glucose uptake, was significantly increased in CD44v10 overexpression cells, while no obvious changes of PGK1 and ENO2 were observed upon CD44v10 ectopic expression (Figs. 4C and S2). These results suggested that GLUT1 may be principally responsible for the CD44v10-induced glycolysis. To substantiate the contribution of GLUT1 in CD44v10-mediated glycolysis, we next investigated whether the knockdown of GLUT1 affects the activated glycolytic processes caused by CD44v10 overexpression. The CD44v10 overexpression cells were transfected with control siRNA or GLUT1 siRNA (Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 4E, the silence of GLUT1 attenuated the increased levels of glucose consumption and lactate production induced by CD44v10 overexpression. A similar result was also obtained on ROS generation, which showed that the knockdown of GLUT1 rescued the reduced ROS level caused by CD44v10 overexpression (Fig. 4F). Further, we explored the mechanism by which CD44v10 induces GLUT1 expression. As we previously reported that CD44v10 could activate MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways (7Guo Q. Liu Y. He Y. Du Y. Zhang G. Yang C. et al.CD44 activation state regulated by the CD44v10 isoform determines breast cancer proliferation.Oncol. Rep. 2021; 45: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and others have indicated that such signaling could induce the GLUT1 expression (17Wu H. Song C. Zhang J. Zhao J. Fu B. Mao T. et al.Melatonin-mediated upregulation of GLUT1 blocks exit from pluripotency by increasing the uptake of oxidized vitamin C in mouse embryonic stem cells.FASEB J. 2017; 31: 1731-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Li C. Chen Q. Zhou Y. Niu Y. Wang X. Li X. et al.S100A2 promotes glycolysis and proliferation via GLUT1 regulation in colorectal cancer.FASEB J. 2020; 34: 13333-13344Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we next asked whether MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT cascades are engaged in the CD44v10-induced upregulation of GLUT1. As expected, the inhibition of the signaling pathways could impair the CD44v10-triggered GLUT1 upregulation (Fig. 4G). Collectively, the data suggested that CD44v10 may upregulate GLUT1 via activating MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in facilitating glycolysis. Metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells has been reported to support the maintenance of CSCs properties (12Feng W. Gentles A. Nair R.V. Huang M. Lin Y. Lee C.Y. et al.Targeting unique metabolic properties of breast tumor initiating cells.Stem Cells. 2014; 32: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Additionally, it is now accepted that CD44v has been identified as one of the important markers of CSCs in many malignant tumors, which prompted us to further investigate whether CD44v10-activated glycolysis could contribute to the stemness properties of TNBC cells. After carrying out sphere formation assays, we found that CD44v10 overexpression remarkably increased the formation of spheroids compared to the control cells in BT-549 cells, whereas CD44v10 knockdown greatly hindered the sphere numbers (Fig. 5A). As the knockdown of CD44v10 could interfere the expressions of all CD44v10-containing isoforms, we next performed a rescue experiment by re-expressing CD44v10 in MDA-MB-231 shCD44v10 cells to further verify the role of individual CD44v10 in mediating TNBC stemness. The results showed that the re-expression of CD44v10 could restore the reduced sphere-forming ability of MDA-MB-231 caused by CD44v10 knockdown (Fig. S3). In addition, Oct4, Klf4, c-Myc, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)1, and Nanog are essential renewing and pluripotent regulators of stem cells and CSCs (19Yang L. Shi P. Zhao G. Xu J. Peng W. Zhang J. et al.Targeting cancer stem cell pathways for cancer therapy.Signal Transduct. Target Ther. 2020; 5: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). We next examined the effects of CD44v10 on the expressions of these CSC-related factors and found that their expressions were upregulated in BT-549 CD44v10 overexpression cells while downregulated in the MDA-MB-231 shCD44v10 group (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, ALDH-positive populations are believed to contain breast CSC subsets (20Ginestier C. Hur M.H. Charafe-Jauffret E. Monville F. Dutcher J. Brown M. et al.ALDH1 is a marker of normal and malignant human mammary stem cells and a predictor of poor clinical outcome.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 555-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3199) Google Scholar). In line with these observations, the proportions of ALDH-positive cells increased from 13.00% to 23.63% in BT-549 CD44v10 overexpression compared with control cells, whereas it decreased from 12.12% to 6.75% in MDA-MB-231 siCD44v10 compared with sicontrol cells (Fig. 5C). To further corroborate the function of CD44v10 on stemness, we then analyzed the expression of CD44v10 in TNBC cell lines grown as either adherent monolayers or nonadherent spheres enriched in CSCs. The results showed that both mRNA and protein levels of CD44v10 were elevated in spherical cells compared to their adherent cells (Fig. 5, D and E). To confirm the contribution of GLUT1 in CD44v10-mediated stemness, we investigated whether the knockdown of GLUT1 could attenuate the enhanced stemness caused by CD44v10 overexpression. As shown in Fig. 5, F and G, GLUT1 knockdown abrogated the upregulation of tumorsphere and stemness gene expression induced by elevated expression of CD44v10 in BT-549 cells. Taken together, these results indicated that CD44v10 confers TNBC stem cell-like phenotype by upregulating GLUT1 expression. CSCs are inherently responsible for tumor resistance to conventional chemotherapy. PTX is a predominantly used systemic treatment for TNBC patients. In light of the crucial role of CD44v10 in CSCs regulation, we sought to investigate whether the CD44v10 isoform is associated with chemosensitivity to PTX. Western blot results showed that PTX treatment increased the expression of CD44v10 along with CSC-related genes (Oct4, Klf4, ALDH, c-Myc, and Nanog) in a dose-dependent manner in both BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (Fig. 6A). In addition, concerning chemical sensitivity, the cytotoxic effects of different concentrations of PTX on CD44v10-regulated cells and their respective control cells were detected after 48 h treatment of PTX by CCK-8 assays. The results indicated that the upregulation of CD44v10 in BT-549 cells resulted in resistance to PTX and its knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells enhanced drug sensitivity to PTX-induced growth inhibition (Fig. 6B). To further verify the role of individual CD44v10 in regulating PTX sensitivity, we performed rescue experiments and found that the re-expression of CD44v10 could attenuate the increased PTX sensitivity caused by CD44v10 knockdown (Fig. S4). Similar results were also obtained in plate colony formation assay (Fig. 6C). These findings indicated that CD44v10 is associated with tumor resistance to chemotherapy. To confirm the contribution of glycolysis in CD44v10-mediated PTX sensitivity, we downregulated GLUT1 in BT-549 CD44v10 overexpression cells and found that the knockdown of GLUT1 could rescue the reduced PTX sensitivity caused by CD44v10 overexpression (Fig. 6D). CD44v10-containing isoforms have been concerned for their overt activities in tumor growth, metastasis, and stemness. However, little is known about whether CD44v10 itself plays role in cancer progression compared to others such as CD44v6 and CD44v3. In this study, we demonstrated that CD44v10 independently promotes stem-like properties and decreases PTX sensitivity of TNBC cells at in vitro experiments. More importantly, we reported a novel mechanism of CD44v10 on BrCas stemness through glucose metabolism, which is mediated by GLUT1-induced glycolysis. Although high-level expression of CD44v10 has been observed in several cancers and correlates with a worse prognosis (21Li N. Tsuji M. Kanda K. Murakami Y. Kanayama H. Kagawa S.

Herein, we evaluated the clinical significance of CD44v10 in breast cancer patients and found that CD44v10 was preferentially expressed in TNBC patients compared with HER2-positive or luminal BrCas. Notably, BrCa patients with high CD44v10 expression had higher histopathological grades and Tumor, Lymph Node, Metastasis stages, as well as shorter overall survival time, implying a potential role of CD44v10 in BrCas progression. Accumulating evidences have indicated that CD44v10-containing isoforms, such as CD44v8-10, CD44v4-10, and CD44v3,8 to 10, are related to cancers in diversity (4Bourguignon L.Y. Gunja-Smith Z. Iida N.

However, the function of CD44v10 alone was largely unknown. Given the fact that the knockdown of exon-v10 could downregulate all expressions of CD44v10-containing isoforms (7Guo Q. Liu Y. He Y. Du Y. Zhang G. Yang C. et al.CD44 activation state regulated by the CD44v10 isoform determines breast cancer proliferation.Oncol. Rep. 2021; 45: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), we performed transcriptomic analysis by establishing a CD44v10 overexpression cell line instead of CD44v10 knockdown to search for mechanisms on CD44v10 in regulating BrCas progression. We found that the differentially expressed genes induced by ectopic expression of CD44v10 were mostly associated with glycolytic processes. We then confirmed that CD44v10 upregulation could promote glycolytic phenotypes, including glucose consumption and lactate production along with ROS defense, whereas CD44v10 downregulation reverses such effects. These findings were consistent with previous studies showing that CD44 is involved in the regulation of the glycolytic pathway in cancer cells (25Tamada M. Nagano O. Tateyama S. Ohmura M. Yae T.

After transcriptomic analysis of TNBC cells, we identified that GLUT1 was the most robustly upregulated gene in CD44v10 overexpression cells. As illustrated before, GLUT1 is the main transporter for cellular glucose uptake and has been reported to be significantly elevated in TNBCs (27Hussein Y.R. Bandyopadhyay S. Semaan A. Ahmed Q.

Our study firstly connected GLUT1 with CD44v10 for the findings that inhibiting GLUT1 could attenuate CD44v10-enhanced glycolysis in TNBC cells. However, it should be noted that GLUT1 downregulation did not completely disrupt the glycolytic phenotype, we hypothesized that CD44v10 may facilitate glycolysis through upregulation of GLUT1 expression along with other genes which need further confirmation. In supporting with our results, a previous study indicated that CD44 ablation could suppress GLUT1 expression (25Tamada M. Nagano O. Tateyama S. Ohmura M. Yae T.

https://openalex.org/W4306155142,"Type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) represent a family of pentameric GABA-gated Cl-/HCO3- ion channels which mediate inhibitory transmission in the central nervous system. Cell surface expression of GABAARs, a prerequisite for their function, is dependent on the appropriate assembly of the receptor subunits and their transient interactions with molecular chaperones within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Here, we describe a highly conserved amino acid sequence within the extracellular N-terminal domain of the receptor subunits adjoining the first transmembrane domain as a region important for GABAAR processing within the ER. Modifications of this region in the α1, β3, and γ2 subunits using insertion or site-directed mutagenesis impaired GABAAR trafficking to the cell surface in heterologous cell systems although they had no effect on the subunit assembly. We found that mutated receptors accumulated in the ER where they were shown to associate with chaperones calnexin, BiP, and Grp94. However, their surface expression was increased when ER-associated degradation or proteosome function was inhibited, while modulation of ER calcium stores had little effect. When compared to the wt, mutated receptors showed decreased interaction with calnexin, similar binding to BiP, and increased association with Grp94. Structural modeling of calnexin interaction with the wt or mutated GABAAR revealed that disruption in structure caused by mutations in the conserved region adjoining the first transmembrane domain may impair calnexin binding. Thus, this previously uncharacterized region plays an important role in intracellular processing of GABAARs at least in part by stabilizing their interaction with calnexin.

Type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAAR) are members of a large family of Cys-loop receptors, pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. GABAARs are inhibitory GABA-gated Cl/HCO3 ion channels expressed by the vast majority of neurones in the adult brain to coordinate the activity and counterbalance the excess excitation. As such, they have a pivotal role in the normal brain function as well as in various neurological and psychiatric diseases (1Sallard E. Letourneur D. Legendre P.

Bambino M.J. Jacob T.C. gamma2 GABAAR trafficking and the consequences of human genetic variation.Front. Cell Neurosci. 2018; 12: 265Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). GABAARs are functionally and pharmacologically diverse heteropentameric assemblies of subunits which have multiple isoforms and are classified as follows: α(1–6), β(1–3), γ(1–3), δ, ε, π, and θ (5Sieghart W. Structure, pharmacology, and function of GABAA receptor subtypes.Adv. Pharmacol. 2006; 54: 231-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), with a common transmembrane topology comprising a large N-terminal extracellular domain (N-ECD), four transmembrane domains (TMs), a major intracellular domain between TMs 3 and 4, and a short C-terminal extracellular domain (6Scott S. Aricescu A.R. A structural perspective on GABAA receptor pharmacology.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 54: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the most common in the brain are GABAARs composed of two α1, two β2, and a γ2 subunit (5Sieghart W. Structure, pharmacology, and function of GABAA receptor subtypes.Adv. Pharmacol. 2006; 54: 231-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The β-subunits play a role in subcellular localization of GABAARs to axons, dendrites or soma, and insertion into the plasma membrane (7Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J.

In order to reach the neuronal cell surface, which is a prerequisite for their function, GABAARs undergo a complex process of assembly from the newly synthesized subunits and posttranslational processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (12Mele M. Costa R.O. Duarte C.B. Alterations in GABAA-receptor trafficking and synaptic dysfunction in brain disorders.Front. Cell Neurosci. 2019; 13: 77Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Lorenz-Guertin J.M. Jacob T.C. GABA type a receptor trafficking and the architecture of synaptic inhibition.Dev. Neurobiol. 2018; 78: 238-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This includes precise coordination of protein–protein interactions between GABAARs and numerous resident proteins, including molecular chaperones which control for the correct folding, glycosylation, maturation and forward trafficking, as well as degradation of misfolded receptors. Our understanding of these processes has been drawn largely from the studies of GABAARs mutations associated with epileptic disorders, many of which impair the ER processing leading to reduced cell surface levels of fully functional receptors (14Macdonald R.L. Kang J.Q. Gallagher M.J. Mutations in GABAA receptor subunits associated with genetic epilepsies.J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 1861-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). At the subunit level, these mutations are grouped within the N-ECD and TMs (15Hernandez C.C. Macdonald R.L. A structural look at GABAA receptor mutations linked to epilepsy syndromes.Brain Res. 2019; 1714: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), indicating that these domains are critical for GABAAR interactions with ER chaperones, including the BiP-quality control mechanism as well as the proteins operating within the glycosylation-dependent calnexin/calreticulin cycle. BiP (Grp78) is the most abundant member of the ER-resident heat shock chaperones that interacts with the hydrophobic parts of proteins, including some of the mutants of GABAARs (16Fu Y.L. Han D.Y. Wang Y.J. Di X.J. Yu H.B. Mu T.W. Remodeling the endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis network restores proteostasis of pathogenic GABAA receptors.PLoS One. 2018; 13e0207948Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which become exposed due to irregular folding. BiP, assisted by several cofactors, can prevent aggregation of misfolded proteins and facilitate their folding, but, if unsuccessful, it can also initiate the unfolded protein response and ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (17Adams B.M. Canniff N.P. Guay K.P. Hebert D.N. The role of endoplasmic reticulum chaperones in protein folding and quality control.Prog. Mol. Subcell Biol. 2021; 59: 27-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The newly synthesized and Asparagine N-glycosylated GABAARs are also subjected to calnexin/calreticulin binding cycle in the ER as the main quality control step. The glycosylation state changes from tri- to monoglucosylated glycans before GABAARs are processed by calnexin/calreticulin and other ER chaperones until correctly folded and trafficked to the Golgi, where they acquire the final glycosylation state with seven N-linked glycans in N-ECDs of the α1(murine N137/human N138), β3 (N105, N174), and γ2 subunits (murine N246/human N247) of the GABAAR heteropentamer (6Scott S.

A number of epilepsy-linked mutations in GABAAR subunits have been shown to reduce their entry into this cycle (14Macdonald R.L. Kang J.Q. Gallagher M.J.

Mutant GABA(A) receptor subunits in genetic (idiopathic) epilepsy.Prog. Brain Res. 2014; 213: 55-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and instead cause their targeting to ERAD pathway, where misfolded receptors interact with the glucose-regulated protein 94 (Grp94), an ER-specific Hsp90, and osteosarcoma amplified 9 protein to be subsequently ubiquitinated by Hrd1, translocated to the cytosol, and degraded by proteosome (20Di X.J. Wang Y.J. Han D.Y. Fu Y.L. Duerfeldt A.S.

However, several pharmacological chaperones have recently been shown to facilitate forward trafficking of GABAAR mutants likely by stabilizing the natively folded receptors allowing them to be transported from the ER to Golgi (16Fu Y.L.

The entry into the calnexin/calreticulin cycle thus represents a critical step for the forward trafficking of GABAARs yet how these interactions are regulated in addition to N-linked oligosaccharide recognition remains unknown. In this study, we have uncovered a highly conserved region in the N-terminal extracellular domains of GABAAR subunits close to the TM1 region which plays a role in positioning of the calnexin lectin domain close to the N-linked oligosaccharide group, thus facilitating the binding of calnexin to GABAARs. The N-ECDs of GABAARs are highly conserved, structurally complex, and essential for GABA-dependent activation, as well as allosteric modulation of these receptors by various clinically important compounds such as benzodiazepines (6Scott S. Aricescu A.R. A structural perspective on GABAA receptor pharmacology.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 54: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). They also participate in the formation of GABAergic synapses by facilitating synaptic adhesion (25Brown L.E. Nicholson M.W. Arama J.E. Mercer A. Thomson A.M. Jovanovic J.N. Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor subunits play a direct structural role in synaptic contact formation via their N-terminal extracellular domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 13926-13942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The aim of our study was to develop an approach which would allow purification of the heteropentameric N-ECDs of GABAARs from the fully assembled and posttranslationally modified receptor pools expressed at the surface of heterologous cells in culture. To achieve this, we used extension overlap mutagenesis to insert a canonical cleavage site for the protease thrombin (LVPRGS) at the end of the N-ECDs of GABAAR α1, β3, and γ2 subunits at the position K248/I249, N242/I243, and M271/G272, respectively (Fig. 1A), taking into consideration the TM1 starting residue for each subunit as shown previously (26Laverty D. Desai R. Uchański T. Masiulis S. Stec W.J. Malinauskas T. et al.Cryo-EM structure of the human α1β3γ2 GABA A receptor in a lipid bilayer.Nature. 2019; 565: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Mutated GABAAR subunits were thus termed Thrombin Cleavage Site (TCS) 1 mutants. This region was selected because it retains a loose structure (Fig. 1B; (18Laverty D. Desai R. Uchanski T. Masiulis S. Stec W.J. Malinauskas T. et al.Cryo-EM structure of the human alpha1beta3gamma2 GABAA receptor in a lipid bilayer.Nature. 2019; 565: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)) with no specific function or interaction reported so far. Importantly, this region faces the outer surface of the receptor pentamer (Fig. 1B), which suggests that it would be easily accessible for thrombin cleavage. This region, however, contains several highly conserved amino acid residues in all main GABAAR subunits (Fig. 1C). Following transient transfection of TCS1-α1, -β3, and -γ2 mutants into HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, A and C) or COS-7 cells (Fig. 2, B and D), immunoblotting analysis of protein lysates confirmed their expression at the MW similar to that of the wt subunits (Fig. 2, A and B). Further analysis of these mutants using immunocytochemistry with antibodies specific for the extracellular epitopes of the receptor subunits demonstrated that mutated subunits were not expressed at the surface of either HEK293 or COS7 cells, although they were abundantly expressed intracellularly in both cell types (Fig. 2, C and D). Although unexpected, these results indicated that insertion mutagenesis in this region impairs cell surface trafficking of GABAARs, guiding us to further explore the underlying mechanism and its functional implications. Given that efficient targeting of the newly synthesized GABAAR subunits to the cell surface is dependent on their correct assembly (7Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Assembly and cell surface expression of heteromeric and homomeric gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), we first tested if TCS1 mutant subunits are assembled with each other in the ER. In these experiments, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with TCS1-α1, -β3, and -γ2 subunit cDNA and their lysates were incubated with either α1-, β3-, or γ2-specific antibodies, followed by analysis of coimmunoprecipitated complexes using SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting with specific antibodies. The results show that in their respective precipitated complexes, TCS1-α1 (Fig. 3A), TCS1-β3 (Fig. 3B), or TCS1-γ2 (Fig. 3C) were accompanied by the other two remaining subunits, indicating that the assembly of mutated subunits into heteropentameric receptors in the ER was not impaired. Thus, TCS mutants were able to form receptor complexes in the ER, but their targeting to the cell surface was inhibited. To test if altering the site of insertion could impact on processing of the mutated receptors and increase their cell surface expression, we have introduced thrombin sequence at the position (K240/R241) in TCS2 and (R238/L239) in TCS3 mutants of the β3 subunit (Fig. 4A). We have also altered the existing sequence in this region of the β3 subunit using site-directed mutagenesis to replace K with G at position 240 and N with G at position 242 to mimic the minimum consensus sequence for thrombin cleavage (Gly-Arg-Gly-X; (27Chang J.Y. Thrombin specificity. Requirement for apolar amino acids adjacent to the thrombin cleavage site of polypeptide substrate.Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)) in the mutant termed ShGG-β3 (Fig. 4A). The new mutants of the β3 subunit were expressed in COS7 cells and detected at the MW similar to that of the wt-β3 subunit in immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 4B). However, quantification of their expression revealed that ShGG and TCS3 were expressed at significantly lower levels of 46.6 ± 3.3 % and 55.7 ± 15.1 % of the wt-β3 expression, respectively (mean ± SD; n = 3 independent biological replicates; p < 0.05; One-Way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni test; Fig. 4B and Table S1). The expression levels of TCS1 and TCS2 were similar to the wt-β3 subunit with 76.1 ± 9.2 % and 83.6 ± 12.5 % of the wt-β3 expression, respectively (mean ± SD; n = 3 independent biological replicates; Fig. 4B and Table S1). To assess the intracellular processing of these mutants, we incubated cell lysates with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or peptide-N-glycosidase F enzymes, followed by SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting to detect various glycosylated forms. The two enzymes have different specificity, such that Endo H selectively cleaves after asparaginyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in the N-linked glycans while PNGase selectively cleaves between the innermost N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and asparagine residue in N-linked glycoproteins yielding the unglycosylated forms. After Endo H digestion, proteins running at a molecular weight similar to the unglycosylated (PGNase processed) forms represent the Endo H–sensitive protein pools, while the higher molecular weight forms represent glycosylated pools resistant to Endo H which have been processed in the Golgi after leaving the ER. While the wt-β3 subunit contained both Endo H–sensitive and Endo H–resistant forms, with Endo H–sensitive form showing 27.1 ± 1.4 % (mean ± SD; n = 3 independent biological replicates) of total β3 immunoreactivity, TCS2-β3 and ShGG-β3 mutants only contained the Endo H–sensitive forms (Fig. 4C; Endo H-S and Endo H-R), suggesting that their exit from the ER was impaired. When transfected into COS7 cells, these mutants showed limited expression at the cell surface in comparison with the wt-β3 subunit, which was successfully targeted to the cell surface as shown previously (Fig. 4D, surface; (8Connolly C.N. Wooltorton J.R. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Subcellular localization of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors is determined by receptor beta subunits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Identification of amino acid residues within GABA(A) receptor beta subunits that mediate both homomeric and heteromeric receptor expression.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6360-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), However, they were expressed intracellularly in abundance (Fig. 4D, total). The surface expression of TCS1-, TCS2-, TCS3-, and ShGG-β3 mutants was quantitatively assessed and compared to that of the wt-β3 subunit using cell surface ELISA (29Nicholson M.W. Sweeney A. Pekle E. Alam S. Ali A.B. Duchen M. et al.Diazepam-induced loss of inhibitory synapses mediated by PLCdelta/Ca(2+)/calcineurin signalling downstream of GABAA receptors.Mol. Psych. 2018; 23: 1851-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As shown in the Figure 4E, these mutants showed a low level of cell surface expression, with TCS1 showing 17.1 ± 8.5 %, TCS2 28.6 ± 23.1 %, TCS3 18.6 ± 13.5 %, and ShGG 19.3 ± 12.4 % of the wt-β3 surface expression (mean ± SD; n = 4 independent biological replicates; Table S2), although they were detected intracellularly in abundance, with TCS1 showing 53.1 ± 19.5%, TCS2 59.7 ± 31.9 %, TCS3 50.4 ± 25.6 %, and ShGG 44.3 ± 22.9 % of the wt-β3 expression (mean ± SD; n = 4 independent biological replicates; Fig. 4F and Table S2). The low level of surface expression of TCS and ShGG mutants was deemed insufficient for attempting to proceed with the thrombin cleavage and purification of N-terminal domains, as originally planned. Thus, modifications of the highly conserved region at the end of the extracellular N-ECD of GABAAR α1, β3, and γ2 subunits do not appear to impair their assembly but, nevertheless, result in significant reduction in cell surface expression of these receptors. These findings suggest that this region may be important for various molecular interactions in the ER that facilitate forward trafficking of GABAAR to the cell surface. To characterize further the intracellular localization of TCS2-β3 and ShGG-β3 mutants, we have carried out immunocytochemical analysis using a β3-specific antibody in combination with antibodies specific for calnexin or Grp94, as ER markers, or Receptor-binding Cancer Antigen expressed on SiSo cells (RCAS1), as a Golgi marker (Fig. 5). The wt-β3 subunit, expressed in control samples, showed expression at the cell surface, as well as intracellularly in the ER and Golgi, where it was partially colocalized with calnexin (Fig. 5A; upper panel), Grp94 (Fig. 5B; upper panel), and RCAS1 (Fig. 5C, upper panel). In contrast, labeled TCS2-β3 and ShGG-β3 were predominantly detected intracellularly in the ER showing a high degree of colocalization with calnexin and Grp94 (Fig. 5, A and B, middle and lower panels) and less colocalization with the Golgi marker RCAS1 (Fig. 5C, middle and lower panels) and, as expected, low level, if any, at the cell surface (Fig. 5, A–C, middle and lower panels). The intracellular localization of TCS mutants was further characterized by subcellular fractionation using discontinuous sucrose gradients and immunoblotting (Fig. S1). GABAARs composed of the wt-α1/β3/γ2 subunits were predominantly detected in the membrane Fraction 3 collected at the interface between 500 mM and 1 M sucrose in lysates of cultured cortical neurones and HEK293 cells (Fig. S1, A and B) where Grp94, calnexin, Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI), RCAS1, and Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP1) were also detected in abundance, indicating that this fraction is enriched in ER and Golgi membranes. In contrast, GABAARs composed of TCS2-α1/β3/γ2 subunits were predominantly detected in the membrane Fraction 4 collected at the interface between 1 M and 1.3 M sucrose, in which Grp94, calnexin, PDI, and LAMP1 could also be detected, but not RCAS1 (Fig. S1C). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that TCS mutants of GABAARs accumulate in the ER. Cell surface expression of newly formed GABAARs is a tightly controlled process which can be upregulated in several ways, including modulation of ER function (21Wang Y.J. Di X.J. Mu T.W. Using pharmacological chaperones to restore proteostasis.Pharmacol. Res. 2014; 83: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), inhibition of receptor degradation by the proteosome (30Saliba R.S. Pangalos M. Moss S.J. The ubiquitin-like protein Plic-1 enhances the membrane insertion of GABAA receptors by increasing their stability within the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18538-18544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), or GABA-mediated chaperoning (31Wang P. Eshaq R.S. Meshul C.K. Moore C. Hood R.L. Leidenheimer N.J. Neuronal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors undergo cognate ligand chaperoning in the endoplasmic reticulum by endogenous GABA.Front. Cell Neurosci. 2015; 9: 188Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To test if regulation of any of these processes using well-established pharmacological approaches could increase targeting of TCS mutants to the cell surface, we have carried out cell surface ELISA with COS7 cells transiently expressing the wt or TCS2 mutants of the α1/β3-Myc/γ2 GABAAR subunits. Following transfection, cells were incubated with 2-APB (100 μM), an IP3-receptor antagonist, Ochratoxin A (10 μM), a SERCA ATPase stimulator, or Thapsigargin (10 μM), a SERCA ATPase inhibitor, for 4 h, fixed and subjected to cell surface ELISA using a Myc tag-specific antibody. These treatments caused no significant change in cell surface levels of TCS2 mutant in comparison with the control DMSO treatment (2-APB: 99.2 ± 20.6 %, Ochratoxin A: 90.9 ± 16.0 %, Thapsigargin: 93.7 ± 19.3 % of control DMSO; all mean ± SD; n = 4 independent biological replicates; Figure 6A, upper graph; Table S3). These treatments also had no significant effect on cell surface expression of the wt-GABAARs (2APB: 84.8 ± 9.9 %; Ochratoxin A: 95.9 ± 5.9 %, Thapsigargin: 92.9 ± 32.1 % control DMSO; all mean ± SD; n = 4 independent biological replicates; Figure 6B, upper graph; Table S3). Total levels of expression of TCS2-mutant showed no change with 2-APB (96.5 ± 6.1 %; mean ± SD; n = 4 independent biological replicates; Figure 6A, lower graph; Table S3) but a significant decrease with Ochratoxin and Thapsigargin (Ochratoxin: 65.1 ± 30.1 %; Thapsigargin: 60.2 ± 23.5 % control DMSO; both mean ± SD; n = 4 independent biological replicates; p < 0.05; One-Way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test; Figure 6A, lower graph; Table S3). Total levels of expression of the wt GABAAR were unchanged following these treatments (2-APB: 107.1 ± 31.5 %, Ochratoxin: 75.5 ± 48.2 %, Thapsigargin: 93.1 ± 12.6 % control DMSO; all mean ± SD; n = 4 independent biological replicates; Figure 6B, lower graph; Table S3). Furthermore, we have tested the effects of prolonged 24-h incubation with GABA (100 μM) on cell surface expression of TCS2 or wt GABAARs. Surface levels were also quantified using cell surface ELISA showing that surface expression of TCS2 mutant or wt GABAAR remained unchanged (TCS2: 90.7 ± 10.3 % control; wt:107.1 ± 8.6 % control DMSO; mean ± SD; n = 4 independent biological replicates; Fig. S2, A and B; upper graphs; Table S7). Total expression was also unchanged, with TCS2 mutants showing 82.6 ± 13.6 % control and wt receptor showing 104.7 ± 15.9 % control (mean ± SD; n = 4 independent biological replicates; Fig. S2, A and B, lower graphs; Table S7). In a separate set of experiments, we have assessed whether 24-h treatments with Verapamil (VPM; 4 μM and 16 μM), a L-type Ca2+ blocker which leads to a decrease in ER Ca2+ efflux and depletion (32Ong D.S. Mu T.W. Palmer A.E. Kelly J.W. Endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ increases enhance mutant glucocerebrosidase proteostasis.Nat. Chem.

However, cell surface levels of TCS2 mutant as well as the wt GABAARs remained unchanged following these treatments (TCS2 at 4 μM: 100.9 ± 6.1 %, TCS2 at 16 μM: 111.5 ± 7.5 %, WT at 4 μM:"
https://openalex.org/W4306167195,"Mutations in the hyperpolarization-activated nucleotide-gated channel 4 (HCN4) are known to be associated with arrhythmias in which QT prolongation (delayed ventricular repolarization) is rare. Here, we identified a HCN4 mutation, HCN4-R666Q, in two sporadic arrhythmia patients with sinus bradycardia, QT prolongation, and short bursts of ventricular tachycardia. To determine the functional effect of the mutation, we conducted clinical, genetic, and functional analyses using whole-cell voltage-clamp, qPCR, Western blot, confocal microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation. The mean current density of HEK293T cells transfected with HCN4-R666Q was lower in 24 to 36 h after transfection and was much lower in 36 to 48 h after transfection relative to cells transfected with wildtype HCN4. Additionally, we determined that the HCN4-R666Q mutant was more susceptible to ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated protein degradation than wildtype HCN4. This decreased current density for HCN4-R666Q could be partly rescued by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. Therefore, we conclude that HCN4-R666Q had an effect on HCN4 function in two aspects, including decreasing the current density of the channel as a biophysical effect and weakening its protein stability. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of the HCN4-R666Q mutation."
https://openalex.org/W4306403596,"Stricture formation is a common complication of Crohn's disease (CD), driven by enhanced deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and expansion of the intestinal smooth muscle layers. Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that exhibits anti-proliferative effects in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). We hypothesized that NR4A1 regulates intestinal SMC proliferation and muscle thickening in the context of inflammation. Intestinal SMCs isolated from Nr4a1+/+ and Nr4a1−/− littermates were subjected to shotgun proteomic analysis, proliferation, and bioenergetic assays. Proliferation was assessed in the presence and absence of NR4A1 agonists, cytosporone-B (Csn-B) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). In vivo, we compared colonic smooth muscle thickening in Nr4a1+/+ and Nr4a1−/− mice using the chronic dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model of colitis. Second, SAMP1/YitFc mice (a model of spontaneous ileitis) were treated with Csn-B and small intestinal smooth muscle thickening was assessed. SMCs isolated from Nr4a1−/− mice exhibited increased abundance of proteins related to cell proliferation, metabolism, and ECM production, whereas Nr4a1+/+ SMCs highly expressed proteins related to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and contractile processes. SMCs isolated from Nr4a1−/− mice exhibited increased proliferation and alterations in cellular metabolism, whereas activation of NR4A1 attenuated proliferation. In vivo, Nr4a1−/− mice exhibited increased colonic smooth muscle thickness following repeated cycles of DSS. Activating NR4A1 with Csn-B, in the context of established inflammation, reduced ileal smooth muscle thickening in SAMP1/YitFc mice. Targeting NR4A1 may provide a novel approach to regulate intestinal SMC phenotype, limiting excessive proliferation that contributes to stricture development in CD."
https://openalex.org/W4306409935,"Circular RNAs participate in the pathogenesis of various tumors, including gastric cancer (GC). In this study, we investigated the role of circBGN in regulating proliferation and invasion of GC cells and elucidated the mechanism. The expression of circBGN was assessed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and in situ hybridization. In addition, loss- and gain-of-function investigations in vitro and in vivo were performed to determine the biological functions of circBGN. Luciferase reporter assays and rescue experiments were applied to investigate the interaction between circBGN and miR-149-5p as well as the relationship between miR-149-5p and IL6. Our results showed that circBGN expression was significantly elevated in GC tissues and cells. Knockdown of circBGN dramatically suppressed GC cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. Xenograft experiments revealed that knockdown of circBGN delayed tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, circBGN can directly bind to miR-149-5p, thereby preventing miR-149-5p from binding to its target mRNA [IL6 mRNA], thus activating IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway. Rescue assays indicated that circBGN regulates GC cell proliferation and invasion by upregulating miR-149-5p/IL6 axis output. Taken together, our investigation indicates that circBGN supports GC progression by activating IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway, thus pointing to a new possible therapeutic target in GC."
https://openalex.org/W4306410088,"Kinesin family member 26b (Kif26b) is essential for kidney development, and its deletion in mice leads to kidney agenesis. However, the roles of this gene in adult settings remain elusive. Thus, this study aims to investigate the role of Kif26b in the progression of renal fibrosis. A renal fibrosis model with adenine administration using Kif26b heterozygous mice and wild-type mice was established. Renal fibrosis and the underlying mechanism were investigated. The underlying pathways and functions of Kif26b were evaluated in an in vitro model using primary renal fibroblasts. Kif26b heterozygous mice were protected from renal fibrosis with adenine administration. Renal expressions of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and myofibroblast accumulation were reduced in Kif26b heterozygous mice. The expression of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II (NMHCII), which binds to the C-terminus of Kif26b protein, was also suppressed in Kif26b heterozygous mice. The in vitro study revealed reduced expressions of CTGF, α-smooth muscle actin, and myosin heavy chain 9 (Myh9) via transfection with siRNAs targeting Kif26b in renal fibroblasts (RFB). RFBs, which were transfected by the expression vector of Kif26b, demonstrated higher expressions of these genes than non-transfected cells. Finally, Kif26b suppression and NMHCII blockage led to reduced abilities of migration and collagen gel contraction in renal fibroblasts. Taken together, Kif26b contributes to the progression of interstitial fibrosis via migration and myofibroblast differentiation through Myh9 in the renal fibrosis model. Blockage of this pathway at appropriate timing might be a therapeutic approach for renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4306410971,"Metabolic effector(s) driving cell fate is an emerging concept in stem cell biology. Here we showed that Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit 6B2 (Cox6B2) is essential to maintain the stemness of trophoblast stem (TS) cells. RNA interference of Cox6b2 resulted in decreased mitochondrial Complex IV activity, ATP production, and oxygen consumption rate in TS cells. Furthermore, depletion of Cox6b2 in TS cells led to decreased self-renewal capacity indicated by compromised BrdU incorporation, Ki67 staining, and decreased expression of TS cell genetic markers. As expected, the consequence of Cox6b2 knockdown was the induction of differentiation. TS cell stemness factor CDX2 transactivates Cox6b2 promoter in TS cells. In differentiated cells, Cox6b2 is post-transcriptionally regulated by two microRNAs, miR-322-5p and miR-503-5p, leading to its downregulation as demonstrated by the gain-in or loss of function of these miRNAs. Cox6b2 transcripts gradually rise in placental trophoblast gestation progresses in both mice and rats with predominant expression in labyrinthine trophoblast. Cox6b2 expression is compromised in the growth-restricted placenta of rats with reciprocal up-regulation of miR-322-5p and miR-503-5p. These data highlight the importance of Cox6B2 in the regulation of TS cell state and uncompromised placental growth."

For this reason, traditional education and training have shifted to an online learning format. This study explores the challenges of and barriers to e-learning experienced by trainers and training coordinators in the Saudi Ministry of Health during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.A cross sectional survey was distributed among participants by email. The sample included 262 trainers and training coordinators currently working for the Saudi Ministry of Health in hospitals, primary health care centers, and training centers (including general directorates of regions and clusters) in all 13 administrative regions of the country.Most participants exhibited an intermediate level of experience with e-learning (58.4%) and found the task of adapting to unfamiliar technology to be a challenge (22.1%). Limited social interaction in relation to cheating/plagiarism contexts, frequent technological failures, and a lack of policies or standards for e-learning were significant barriers for participants; these were mentioned by 46.9%, 43.5%, and 40.1% of participants, respectively.This study highlights the challenges and barriers encountered in the adoption of e-learning by trainers and training coordinators in the Saudi Ministry of Health. The challenges of and barriers to e-learning included but were not limited to communication, assessment of trainees, adaptation to a lack of policy, and frequent technology failure. Adapting to new technologies is challenging for trainers and training coordinators, which is exacerbated by a lack of adequate policies and standards to eliminate cheating and avoid technological failures. These results could help bridge gaps in the use of e-learning by improving policies, holding workshops and training sessions, and providing continuous information technology support in e-learning."
https://openalex.org/W4304889637,"G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that can generate cytosolic NADPH for biosynthesis and oxidative defense. Since cytosolic NADPH can be compensatively produced by other sources, the enzymatic activity deficiency alleles of G6PD are well tolerated in somatic cells but the effect of null mutations is unclear. Herein, we show that G6PD KO sensitizes cells to the stresses induced by hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, hypoxia, and the inhibition of the electron transport chain. This effect can be completely reversed by the expressions of natural mutants associated with G6PD deficiency, even without dehydrogenase activity, exactly like the WT G6PD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that G6PD can physically interact with AMPK (AMPK-activated protein kinase) to facilitate its activity and directly bind to NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) to promote its activity and maintain the NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ homeostasis. These functions are necessary to the antistress ability of cells but independent of the dehydrogenase activity of G6PD. In addition, the WT G6PD and naturally inactive mutant also can similarly regulate the metabolism of glucose, glutamine, fatty acid synthesis, and GSH and interact with the involved enzymes. Therefore, our findings reveal the previously unidentified functions of G6PD that can act as the important physiological neutralizer of stresses independently of its enzymatic activity.

Therefore, our findings reveal the previously unidentified functions of G6PD that can act as the important physiological neutralizer of stresses independently of its enzymatic activity. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a metabolic pathway derived from the first product, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), of glycolysis (1Stincone A. Prigione A. Cramer T. Wamelink M.M. Campbell K. Cheung E. et al.The return of metabolism: biochemistry and physiology of the pentose phosphate pathway.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 2015; 90: 927-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). It generates NADPH for biosynthesis and carbohydrates with different carbons, in particular the pentose, ribose-5-phosphate, for the synthesis of nucleotides. The PPP consists of two distinct phases. G6P is first catalyzed by G6P dehydrogenase (G6PD) to initiate the oxidative phase that produces NADPH and rublose-5-phosphate. In the following nonoxidative phase, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-carbon sugars are synthesized, and they can be interconverted to fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate that are incorporated into and connected with glycolysis. All the transformations in the second stage are reversible, thus the metabolic intermediates including ribose-5-phosphate can also be initially produced from glycolytic fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, without NADPH being generated. Therefore, the two phases are often designated as the oxidative PPP (oxPPP) and nonoxidative PPP (non-oxPPP). The reducing power NADPH is mainly utilized for oxidative defense and biosynthesis, in particular, lipogenesis and nucleotides biosynthesis (2Patra K.C. Hay N. The pentose phosphate pathway and cancer.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2014; 39: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 3Jiang P. Du W. Wu M. Regulation of the pentose phosphate pathway in cancer.Protein Cell. 2014; 5: 592-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The oxPPP is the major regenerator source of cytosolic NADPH, and its rate-limiting enzyme, G6PD, has been extensively studied (1Stincone A. Prigione A. Cramer T. Wamelink M.M. Campbell K. Cheung E. et al.The return of metabolism: biochemistry and physiology of the pentose phosphate pathway.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 2015; 90: 927-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that the cytosolic NADPH can also be substantively compensated by NADPH-generating enzymes, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and malic enzyme 1 (ME1), when G6PD is knocked out in cells (4Chen L. Zhang Z. Hoshino A. Zheng H.D. Morley M. Arany Z. et al.NADPH production by the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway supports folate metabolism.Nat. Metab. 2019; 1: 404-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It can explain why G6PD deficiency alleles are well tolerated, except that it could bring a risk of acute nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia triggered by exogenous oxidative stressors in red blood cells (5Cappellini M.D. Fiorelli G.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 2016; 30: 373-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). G6PD deficiency is the commonest disease of human enzyme defect, and its variants are divided into several types based on the report from the World Health Organization (7WHO W.G. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.Bull. World Health Organ. 1989; 67: 601-611PubMed Google Scholar), class-I G6PD mutants with activity often less than 1% of normal are associated with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia; class-II has an activity less than 10% of normal; class-III shows 10% to 60% of residual enzyme activity; class-IV are nearly normally active. Intriguingly, up to date, 85 class-I mutants, accounting for about 45% of the total, are identified, but no null mutation has been reported (6Luzzatto L. Nannelli C. Notaro R.

Dis. 2012; 48: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Moreover, the KO of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) in the oxPPP, the downstream enzyme of G6PD, even protects cells against oxidative stress (9Dubreuil M.M. Morgens D.W. Okumoto K. Honsho M. Contrepois K.

These observations suggest that G6PD protein could have other function(s) than the mediation of the oxPPP, which is indispensable to embryonic development. The complete KO of G6PD is indeed reported to be embryonically lethal in mice (10Longo L. Vanegas O.C. Patel M. Rosti V. Li H.

Recently, we built up an electron balance model to integrate the metabolic behaviors in the stress conditions and revealed that the oxPPP was shut down and shifted to the non-oxPPP to reduce electron production under hypoxia and the electron transport chain (ETC) inhibition (12Liu M.

Although G6PD KO sensitized cells to the stresses of oxidation, hypoxia, and ETC inhibition (4Chen L. Zhang Z. Hoshino A. Zheng H.D. Morley M.

Ther. 2021; 6: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we found that the naturally mutated G6PD sufficiently restored the antioxidant activity as the WT enzyme does (14Zhong B. Jiang D. Hong Y.

Ther. 2021; 6: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that G6PD exerts antistress effects depending on its interaction with many proteins instead of its dehydrogenase activity. G6PD is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the oxPPP that can generate NADPH (Fig. S1A), and thus, it was thought to exert a critical antioxidant role. To determine whether the dehydrogenase activity is required for its antioxidant ability, we used CRISPR/cas9–mediated KO system (15Sanjana N.E. Shalem O. Zhang F. Improved vectors and genome-wide libraries for CRISPR screening.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 783-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar) to delete G6PD in HeLa cells and then re-expressed the WT or mutated enzyme. The mutated G6PDs tested here involved natural G6PD deficiency–associated variants including R166H, R257G, 242 to 243Δ with two residues missed, R393H, V394L, N363K, G488V, R198S, and R198P (8Minucci A.

Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2A). Our results confirmed that G6PD loss significantly sensitized HeLa cells to hydrogen peroxide (Fig. S2B), consistent with recent reports (4Chen L. Zhang Z. Hoshino A. Zheng H.D. Morley M. Arany Z. et al.NADPH production by the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway supports folate metabolism.Nat. Metab. 2019; 1: 404-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Zhong B. Jiang D.

Ther. 2021; 6: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Similar to WT G6PD, all the natural variants completely prevented cells from hydrogen peroxide treatment (Fig. S2B). In sharp contrast, mechanism-based mutants almost showed no effect (Fig. S2B). Meantime, we measured the dehydrogenase activity of these enzymes using cellular lyses. Most natural mutants showed impaired activities, but R198S and R198P, as well as all the mechanism-based mutants, had no detectable activity (Fig. S2C). Next, we further investigated the functions of G6PD using WT HeLa cells (HeLa/WT), G6PD KO HeLa cells (HeLaKO), and KO cells re-expressing Flag-tagged WT G6PD (HeLaWT), natural R198P variant (HeLaR198P), or mechanism-based H263A mutant (HeLaH263A). First, we confirmed again that cellular lyses from HeLaKO, HeLaR198P, or HeLaH263A did not have G6PD activity, while those from HeLa/WT or HeLaWT cells showed robust activity (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, the product of G6PD, 6-phosphoglucono-σ-lactone (6PGL) (Fig. 1B), and the [3-2H]-glucose-labeled NADPH m + 1 generated from oxPPP (18Lewis C.A. Parker S.J. Fiske B.P. McCloskey D. Gui D.Y.

The most important product of PPP, ribose 5-phosphate, can be immediately used for de novo biosynthesis of IMP, AMP, and GMP (Fig. S1A), and their cellular levels did not decline in HeLaKO cells (Fig. S1B). We also observed compensatively increased [3-2H]-glucose–labeled NADPH m + 2 in HeLaKO, as well as HeLaR198P or HeLaH263A cells (Fig. 1C), which resulted from the newly synthesized NADPH incorporating ribose 5-phosphate m + 2 derived from the non-oxPPP (14Zhong B. Jiang D. Hong Y. Li L. Qiu L. Yang R. et al.Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase neutralizes stresses by supporting reductive glutamine metabolism and AMPK activation.Signal Transduct. Target. Ther. 2021; 6: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the non-oxPPP compensatively supplies the oxPPP-derived intermediates for biosynthesis (Fig. S1A). To further determine the enzymatic activity of these G6PD mutants, we used anti-Flag M2 beads to purify G6PD from HeLaWT, HeLaR198P, and HeLaH263A cells (Fig. S2D) and measured their activities. Our results showed that Flag-G6PD-WT exerted dose- and time-dependent activity, while Flag-R198P and Flag-H263A did not at all (Fig. 1D). Next, we purified His-tagged recombinant G6PD proteins expressed in bacteria (Fig. S2D) and again demonstrated that G6PD-WT had a robust activity, whereas R198P and H263A mutants were totally inactive (Fig. 1E). In addition to hydrogen peroxide, G6PD-R198P also prevented G6PD-KO HeLa cells from death induced by a superoxide inducer, phenazine methosulfate (PMS) (19Chan E. Weiss B. Endonuclease IV of escherichia coli is induced by paraquat.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3189-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), hypoxia, or ETC inhibition with antimycin A, exactly like G6PD-WT (Fig. 1F). In fact, even the re-expression of G6PD-H263A also slightly protected HeLaKO cells against hydrogen peroxide, PMS, antimycin A, and hypoxia (Fig. 1F). We also observed that HeLaR198P and HeLaWT cells had better colony formation ability and tumor growth in nude mice, compared with HeLaKO cells (Fig. 1, G and H). Our previous report demonstrated that hypoxia and antimycin A reduced the activity of oxPPP (12Liu M. Wang Y. Yang C. Ruan Y. Bai C. Chu Q. et al.Inhibiting both proline biosynthesis and lipogenesis synergistically suppresses tumor growth.J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217e20191226Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Herein, we found that hydrogen peroxide decreased the [3-2H]-glucose–labeled NADPH m + 1 generated from oxPPP and the total level of cellular NAPDH (Fig. S1C), suggesting the suppression of the oxPPP. Therefore, these data, taken together, clearly manifest that the dehydrogenase activity and the oxPPP are not required for the antistress ability of G6PD. We next further tested the sensitivity of HeLa cells expressing G6PD variants to PMS. As shown in Figure 2A, HeLaKO and HeLaH263A cells were much more sensitive to PMS treatment, while HeLaWT and HeLaR198P cells displayed similar resistance to PMS, compared with HeLa/WT cells. PMS-induced death in HeLaKO cells was significantly prevented by z-VAD-FMK (an apoptosis inhibitor) (20Fearnhead H.O. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. An interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme-like protease is a common mediator of apoptosis in thymocytes.FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but not by necrostatin-1 (a necroptosis inhibitor) (21Wang K. Li J. Degterev A. Hsu E. Yuan J. Yuan C. Structure-activity relationship analysis of a novel necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-5.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2007; 17: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), or ferrostatin-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) (22Bogacz M. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Tryparedoxin peroxidase-deficiency commits trypanosomes to ferroptosis-type cell death.Elife. 2018; 7e37503Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B), suggesting the occurrence of caspases-mediated apoptosis. This speculation was further confirmed by results that PMS treatment led to a significant increase in annexin V-staining, cleaved PARP1, and cleaved caspase-3, three indicators of apoptosis, in HeLaKO and HeLaH263A cells but not in HeLaWT and HeLaR198P cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Next, to expand the generality, we deleted G6PD in MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells and re-expressed WT, R198P, or H263A G6PD, respectively. Indeed, G6PD-WT and R198P similarly enabled the G6PD-KO cells resistance to PMS treatments, whereas H263A mutant did not (Fig. 2, E and F). Therefore, these data suggest that G6PD protects cells against oxidative stress–induced apoptosis independently of its dehydrogenase activity. Recently, it had been reported that G6PD product 6PGL potentially promoted AMPK activation through Src (23Gao X. Zhao L. Liu S. Li Y. Xia S. Chen D. et al.gamma-6-Phosphogluconolactone, a byproduct of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, contributes to AMPK activation through inhibition of PP2A.Mol. Cell. 2019; 76: 857-871.e9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our recent report also showed that G6PD supported the activation of AMPK pathway (14Zhong B. Jiang D. Hong Y. Li L. Qiu L. Yang R. et al.Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase neutralizes stresses by supporting reductive glutamine metabolism and AMPK activation.Signal Transduct. Target. Ther. 2021; 6: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Herein, we used 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) (24Sullivan J.E. Brocklehurst K.J. Marley A.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. Inhibition of lipolysis and lipogenesis in isolated rat adipocytes with AICAR, a cell-permeable activator of AMP-activated protein kinase.FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) to activate AMPK in HeLaWT and HeLaKO cells and measured the phosphorylation of AMPKα at Thr172 and its specific substrate ACC1 at Ser79. Our results confirmed that the phosphorylations of AMPKα-Thr172 and ACC1-Ser79 in HeLaKO cells were obviously slower than those in HeLaWT cells upon AICAR treatment (Fig. 3A). Moreover, pretreatment of AICAR significantly prevented HeLaKO cells from death induced by antimycin A (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the dehydrogenase activity of G6PD is required for the activation of AMPK pathway, we used a selective AMPK activator, A-769662, to act on HeLaKO, HeLaWT, HeLaR198P, and HeLaH263A cells and found that it effectively induced the phosphorylation of AMPK-Thr172 and ACC1-Ser79 in HeLaWT and HeLaR198P cells but not in HeLaKO and HeLaH263A cells (Fig. 3C). As expected, the pretreatment of HeLaKO cells with A-769662 also prevented antimycin A-induced, PMS-induced, and hydrogen peroxide–induced death (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that G6PD exerts antistress roles at least by supporting the activation of AMPK pathway, which does not require its dehydrogenase activity. Meanwhile, we observed higher basic levels of pAMPK in HeLaKO and HeLaH263A cells than those in HeLaWT and HeLaR198P cells but no apparent difference in the basic levels of pACC1 in these cells (Fig. 3, A and C). Therefore, G6PD is probably favorable to the activity of AMPK, and its deletion compensatively enhanced the activation of AMPK and the phosphorylations of AMPKα-Thr172. Now, we used an in vitro system to test whether G6PD contributed to the activity of AMPK. To simulate the intracellular environment to a greater extent, we expressed Flag-tagged AMPKα1 in HeLaKO cells and the enriched AMPKα1 using anti-Flag M2 beads. The immunoprecipitates should contain the upstream kinases, so that the addition of ATP to the immunoprecipitates largely increased the level of pAMPKα-Thr172 (Fig. 3E). In addition, the immunoprecipitates also contained the downstream substrate ACC1 of AMPK, and we observed that G6PD significantly promoted the phosphorylation of ACC1, indicating the enhanced activity of AMPK by G6PD (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, we found that G6PD-R198P also promoted the activity of AMPK, similar to G6PD-WT (Fig. 3F). Next, to determine how G6PD facilitates AMPK activity, we carried out immunoprecipitation (IP) combined with mass spectrometry (MS) to identify different proteins binding to G6PD-WT over to G6PD-H263A (Fig. S3A). AMPKγ was found to strongly interact with G6PD-WT (Fig. S3A and Table S1). Next, we expressed Flag-tagged G6PD-WT, R198P, and H263A in 293T cells, and our coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) results showed that G6PD-WT and R198P mutant obviously precipitated with AMPKα, AMPKβ, and AMPKγ (Fig. 4A). By contrast, G6PD-H263A mutant only weakly interacted with AMPK (Fig. 4A). We then purified His-tagged G6PD, glutathione-S-transferase (GST)–tagged AMPKα1, AMPKβ1, and AMPKγ1 expressed in the bacterial system and demonstrated that G6PD-WT directly interplayed with AMPKα1 (Fig. 4B). Purified His-G6PD R198P, but not H263A, also directly interacted with AMPKα1 (Fig. S3B). In addition, we also observed the interaction between endogenous AMPKα and G6PD (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, we applied Venus-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualize the interaction between proteins using mCherry as the intercontrol (Fig. 4D). In order to ensure that these proteins were expressed in equal proportions, we constructed the genes for these proteins in a single ORF, with a self-cleaving P2A peptide inserted between them (Fig. 4D). When this plasmid is expressed in cells, the translated protein will be self-cleaved into a Vn (Venus N-terminal 2–173 amino acid residues)-fused protein (PA), mCherry, and a Vc (Venus C-terminal 155–238 amino acid residues)-fused protein (PB). If PA and PB interacted with each other, Vn and Vc would get close and form a functional Venus to emit yellow fluorescence. We fused Vn to G6PD and Vc to AMPKα1 and observed much stronger yellow fluorescence upon G6PP WT-AMPKα1 and R198P-AMPKα1 interactions than upon H263A-AMPKα1 interaction (Fig. 4D). AMPKα consisted of the N-terminal kinase domain and C-terminal regulation domain that was responsible for the binding of AMPKβ and AMPKγ (25Kim J. Yang G. Kim Y. Kim J. Ha J. AMPK activators: mechanisms of action and physiological activities.Exp. Mol. Med. 2016; 48e224Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4E). Our Co-IP assay showed that G6PD was mainly bound to the kinase domain of AMPKα1 (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, the stress induced by PMS appeared to enhance the interaction between G6PD and AMPK complex (Fig. 4F), indicating the involvement of G6PD and AMPK in the stress response. Taken together, these results suggest that G6PD supports AMPK activity probably by physical interaction, regardless of its dehydrogenase activity. Similar to the previous report (4Chen L. Zhang Z. Hoshino A. Zheng H.D. Morley M. Arany Z. et al.NADPH production by the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway supports folate metabolism.Nat. Metab. 2019; 1: 404-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), NADPH/NADP+ ratio was dramatically reduced in HeLaKO cells, but it was totally reversed by re-expression of G6PD-WT or R198P mutant but not by H263A (Fig. 5A). Notably, the cellular NADPH levels kept less changeable in all the cell lines. In contrast, the NADP+ contents were dramatically enhanced in HeLaKO and HeLaH263A cells (Fig. 5A). Meanwhile, we measured an increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio but a decrease in the cellular levels of both NADH and NAD+ in HeLaKO cells and HeLaH263A, compared to HeLa/WT, HeLaWT, and HeLaR198P cells (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that G6PD can maintain the NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ homeostasis, and this effect does not depend on its dehydrogenase activity. The biosynthesis of NAD+ and NADP+ is accomplished through either de novo pathway from tryptophan or the salvage pathway from nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, or nicotinic acid riboside (Fig. S4A). We detected the expressions of the involved enzymes and found no phenotype-associated difference between HeLaKO, HeLaWT, and HeLaR198P cells (Fig. S4B). We then used [2,4,5,6-2H]-nicotinamide to trace the biosynthesis of NAD+ and NADP+ (Fig. 5C) (26Liu L. Su X. Quinn 3rd, W.J. Hui S. Krukenberg K. Frederick D.W. et al.Quantitative analysis of NAD synthesis-breakdown fluxes.Cell Metab. 2018; 27: 1067-1080.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and our results showed that the fraction of newly synthesized NAD+ m + 3 significantly decreased in HeLaKO cells, which was reversed by re-expression of G6PD-WT and R198P mutant (Fig. 5D). In contrast, the labeled fractions of NADP+ were similar in HeLa/WT, HeLaWT, HeLaR198P, HeLaKO, and HeLaH263A cells (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that G6PD KO could suppress NAD+ biosynthesis while promoting NADP+ biosynthesis. Recently, it has been reported that G6PD promotes NADP+ biosynthesis by directly binding to NADK to activate its activity (27Zhang Y. Xu Y. Lu W. Ghergurovich J.M. Guo L. Blair I.A. et al.Upregulation of antioxidant capacity and nucleotide precursor availability suffices for oncogenic transformation.Cell Metab. 2021; 33: 94-109.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, we expressed Flag-G6PD in 293T cells and the Co-IP assay did not detect the interaction between G6PD and NADK (Fig. S4C). Furthermore, we purified G6PD and NADK and still did not observe the interaction between them in the in vitro pull-down assay (Fig. S4D). Moreover, we found that G6PD did not significantly affect the activity of NADK (Fig. S4E). Therefore, we further detected the interaction of G6PD with nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and NMNAT2, the two enzymes involved in NAD+ biosynthesis, and found that G6PD did not physically bind to NMNAT2 (Fig. S4F) but coimmunoprecipitated with NAMPT (Fig. 5E). Moreover, G6PD-WT and R198P mutant showed much stronger binding to NAMPT than H263A (Fig. 5E). In reverse, NAMPT also coprecipitated with G6PD (Fig. 5F). We then purified the recombinant GST-NAMPT and His-G6PD and demonstrated the direct interaction between them (Fig. 5G). The Co-IP results also detected the interaction between the endogenous G6PD and NAMPT (Fig. 4C). The bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay further confirmed that G6PD interacted with NAMPT but not NADK (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data emphasize that G6PD bind to NAMPT. Therefore, we next investigated whether G6PD affected the activity of NAMPT using an in vitro assay. Our results showed that G6PD-WT and R198P mutant accelerated the activity of NAMPT in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 5H and S5, A and B). By contrast, H263A mutant only slightly activated NAMPT (Figs. 5H and S5A). Now we overexpressed Flag-tagged WT NAMPT and inactivated NAMPT-H247A mutant in HeLaKO cells (Fig. S5C). We observed that Flag-NAMPT, not Flag-NAMPT-H247A, significantly restored the cellular levels of NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH (Fig. S5, D and E) and maintained the homeostasis of NADH/NAD+ and NADPH/NADP+, under the normal condition or treatment with PMS (Fig. 5I). NAD+ is the substrate of NADK but NADH potently inhibited NADK (Fig. S5F). Therefore, the ratio of NADH/NAD+ should tightly control the biosynthesis of NADP+. In addition, the forced expression of Flag-NAMP significantly protected HeLaKO cells against the treatments with PMS, antimycin A, or hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 5J). These results suggest that G6PD maintains the homeostasis of NADH/NAD+ and NADPH/NADP+ independently of its dehydrogenase activity, at least partially through promoting NAMPT activity. Although the aforementioned results demonstrated that G6PD supported AMPK activat"

https://openalex.org/W4306169156,"Oligoribonucleases (Orns) are highly conserved DnaQ-fold 3'-5' exoribonucleases that have been found to carry out the last step of cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) degradation, that is, pGpG to GMP in several bacteria. Removal of pGpG is critical for c-di-GMP homeostasis, as excess uncleaved pGpG can have feedback inhibition on phosphodiesterases, thereby perturbing cellular signaling pathways regulated by c-di-GMP. Perturbation of c-di-GMP levels not only affects survival under hypoxic, reductive stress, or nutrient-limiting conditions but also affects pathogenicity in infection models as well as antibiotic response in mycobacteria. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of MSMEG_4724, the Orn of Mycobacterium smegmatis (Ms_orn) to 1.87 Å resolution to investigate the function of its extended C-terminal tail that is unique among bacterial Orns. Ms_orn is a homodimer with the canonical RNase-H fold of exoribonucleases and conserved catalytic residues in the active site. Further examination of the substrate-binding site with a modeled pGpG emphasized the role of a phosphate cap and ""3'OH cap"" in constricting a 2-mer substrate in the active site. The unique C-terminal tail of Ms_orn aids dimerization by forming a handshake-like flap over the second protomer of the dimer. Our thermal and denaturant-induced unfolding experiments suggest that it helps in higher stability of Ms_orn as compared with Escherichia coli Orn or a C-terminal deletion mutant. We also show that the C-terminal tail is required for modulating response to stress agents in vivo. These results will help in further evaluating the role of signaling and regulation by c-di-GMP in mycobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4306403663,"Neurite outgrowth is a fundamental process in neurons that produces extensions and, consequently, neural connectivity. Neurite damage and atrophy are observed in various brain injuries and disorders. Understanding the intrinsic pathways of neurite outgrowth is essential for developing strategies to stimulate neurite regeneration. Insulin is a pivotal hormone in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. There is increasing evidence for the neurotrophic functions of insulin, including the induction of neurite outgrowth. However, the associated mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that insulin potentiates neurite outgrowth mediated by the small GTPases ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) through the neuronal adaptor FE65. Moreover, insulin enhances atypical protein kinase Cι/λ (PKCι/λ) activation and FE65 phosphorylation at serine 459 (S459) in neurons and mouse brains. In vitro and cellular assays show that PKCι/λ phosphorylated FE65 at S459. Consistently, insulin potentiates FE65 S459 phosphorylation only in the presence of PKCι/λ. Phosphomimetic studies show that an FE65 S459E mutant potently activates ARF6, Rac1, and neurite outgrowth. Notably, this phosphomimetic mutation enhances the FE65-ARF6 interaction, a process that promotes ARF6-Rac1-mediated neurite outgrowth. Likewise, insulin treatment and PKCι/λ overexpression potentiate the FE65–ARF6 interaction. Conversely, PKCι/λ knockdown suppresses the stimulatory effect of FE65 on ARF6-Rac1-mediated neurite outgrowth. The effect of insulin on neurite outgrowth is also markedly attenuated in PKCι/λ knockdown neurons, in the presence and absence of FE65. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism linking insulin with ARF6-Rac1-dependent neurite extension through the PKCι/λ-mediated phosphorylation of FE65."
https://openalex.org/W4306409611,"Obesity is among the strongest risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D). The CREBRF missense allele rs373863828 (p. Arg457Gln, p. R457Q) is associated with increased body mass index but reduced risk of T2D in people of Pacific ancestry. To investigate the functional consequences of the CREBRF variant, we introduced the corresponding human mutation R457Q into the porcine genome. The CREBRFR457Q pigs displayed dramatically increased fat deposition, which was mainly distributed in subcutaneous adipose tissue other than visceral adipose tissue. The CREBRFR457Q variant promoted preadipocyte differentiation. The increased differentiation capacity of precursor adipocytes conferred pigs the unique histological phenotype that adipocytes had a smaller size but a greater number in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of CREBRFR457Q variant pigs. In addition, in SAT of CREBRFR457Q pigs, the contents of the peroxidative metabolites 4-hydroxy-nonenal and malondialdehyde were significantly decreased, while the activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, was increased, which was in accordance with the declined level of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CREBRFR457Q pigs. Together, these data supported a causal role of the CREBRFR457Q variant in the pathogenesis of obesity, partly via adipocyte hyperplasia, and further suggested that reduced oxidative stress in adipose tissue may mediate the relative metabolic protection afforded by this variant despite the related obesity."

Human intestinal organoid (HIO)-derived tissue-engineered intestine is a potential cure for IF. Research to date has demonstrated successful HIO transplantation (tHIO) into mice with significant in vivo maturation. An area lacking in the literature is exploration of murine host sex as a biological variable (SABV) in tHIO function. In this study, we investigate murine host SABV in tHIO epithelial barrier function and muscle contractility. HIOs were generated in vitro and transplanted into nonobese diabetic, severe combined immunodeficiency gamma chain deficient male and female mice. tHIOs were harvested after 8–12 weeks in vivo. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were conducted to compare tight junctions and contractility-related markers in tHIOs. An Ussing chamber and contractility apparatus were used to evaluate tHIO epithelial barrier and muscle contractile function, respectively. The expression and morphology of tight junction and contractility-related markers from tHIOs in male and female murine hosts is not significantly different. Epithelial barrier function as measured by transepithelial resistance, short circuit current, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran permeability is no different in tHIOs from male and female hosts, although these results may be limited by HIO epithelial immaturity and a short flux time. Muscle contractility as measured by total contractile activity, amplitude, frequency, and tension is not significantly different in tHIOs from male and female hosts. The data suggest that murine host sex may not be a significant biological variable influencing tHIO function, specifically epithelial barrier maintenance and muscle contractility, though limitations exist in our model."

Although it is known that C3aR is protective in several models of acute bacterial infections, the role for C3aR in chronic infection is largely unknown. Here we show that C3aR is protective in experimental chronic pyelonephritis. Global C3aR deficient (C3ar−/−) mice had higher renal bacterial load, more pronounced renal histological lesions, increased renal apoptotic cell accumulation, tissue inflammation and extracellular matrix deposition following renal infection with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strain IH11128, compared to WT control mice. Myeloid C3aR deficient (Lyz2-C3ar−/−) mice exhibited a similar disease phenotype to global C3ar−/− mice. Pharmacological treatment with a C3aR agonist reduced disease severity in experimental chronic pyelonephritis. Furthermore, macrophages of C3ar−/− mice exhibited impaired ability to phagocytose UPEC. Our data clearly demonstrate a protective role for C3aR against experimental chronic pyelonephritis, macrophage C3aR plays a major role in the protection, and C3aR is necessary for phagocytosis of UPEC by macrophages. Our observation that C3aR agonist curtailed the pathology suggests a therapeutic potential for activation of C3aR in chronic infection."

The results show that the new network has faster convergence, better robustness and higher accuracy. No overfitting has occurred. A heatmap visualization method was introduced for analysis.

https://openalex.org/W4306630449,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat. SCA7 predominantly causes a loss of photoreceptors in the retina and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Severe infantile-onset SCA7 also causes renal and cardiac irregularities. Previous reports have shown that SCA7 results in increased susceptibility to DNA damage. Since DNA damage can lead to accumulation of senescent cells, we hypothesized that SCA7 causes an accumulation of senescent cells over the course of disease. A 140-CAG repeat SCA7 mouse model was evaluated for signs of disease-specific involvement in the kidney, heart, and cerebellum, tissues that are commonly affected in the infantile form. We found evidence of significant renal abnormality that coincided with an accumulation of senescent cells in the kidneys of SCA7140Q/5Q mice, based on histology findings in addition to RT-qPCR for the cell cycle inhibitors p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 and senescence-associated ß-galactosidase (SA-ßgal) staining, respectively.

A sensor node array model was established to detect ball collision point on the table tennis table. This model clearly illuminated the working mechanism of the proposed umpiring system. And an improved particle swarm optimization (level-based competitive swarm optimization) was applied to optimize the arrayed sensor nodes distribution by redefining the representations and update rules of position and velocity. The optimized results showed that the number of sensors decreased from 58 to 51. Also, the reliability of the optimized nodes distribution of the table tennis umpiring system has been verified theoretically. The results revealed that our system achieved a precise detection of the ball collision point with uniform error distances below 3.5 mm.

https://openalex.org/W4306631529,"Hearing loss (HL) is a global health problem with a high prevalence and profound socioeconomic impact. Pyrethroids are one of the most commonly used insecticides. Although previous studies have reported the relationship between pyrethroids and neurotoxicity, little is known about the effect of pyrethroid exposure on the auditory system among the general population. This study is aimed to investigate the association of pyrethroid exposure with hearing threshold shifts of adults in the United States. A total of 726 adults, aged from 20 to 69 years from the 2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data were included in the study. Urinary 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a general pyrethroid metabolite, was used as a biomarker for pyrethroid exposure. HL was defined as a pure-tone average (PTA) at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz ≥ 20 dB in the better ear. Analyses by using multivariate linear regressions were conducted to explore the associations of urinary 3-PBA with PTA hearing threshold shifts. There were no statistically significant correlations between Ln-transformed 3-PBA and either low-frequency or high-frequency hearing thresholds after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, firearm noise exposure, occupational noise exposure, recreational noise exposure, serum cotinine, BMI, hypertension, and diabetes. However, associations of 3-PBA with both low-frequency and high-frequency hearing thresholds depended on age ( P interaction &lt; 0.0396 and 0.0017, respectively). Positive associations between Ln-transformed 3-PBA and both low-frequency and high-frequency hearing thresholds were observed in participants aged 20–39 years after adjusting confounders (β = 1.53, 95% CI: 0.04–3.01, and β = 3.14, 95% CI: 0.99–5.29, respectively) with the highest tertile (≥ 0.884 μg/g creatinine) of 3-PBA compared with the lowest tertile (&lt; 0.407 μg/g creatinine). The possibility of interaction between 3-PBA and age on the hearing threshold shifts indicated that pyrethroid insecticides were prone to be more toxic to auditory system in younger adults than in older ones. Further studies will be required to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W4306664305,"Abstract While oxidative stress is known as key element in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and calcific aortic valve disease, its role in the degeneration of biological cardiovascular grafts has not been clarified yet. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the impact of oxidative stress on the degeneration of biological cardiovascular allografts in a standardized chronic implantation model realized in rats exhibiting superoxide dismutase 3 deficiency (SOD3 (−) ). Rats with SOD3 loss‐of‐function mutation ( n = 24) underwent infrarenal implantation of cryopreserved valved aortic conduits, while SOD3‐competent recipients served as controls ( n = 28). After a follow‐up period of 4 or 12 weeks, comparative analyses addressed degenerative processes, hemodynamics, and evaluation of the oxidative stress model. SOD3 (−) rats presented decreased circulating SOD activity ( p = .0079). After 12 weeks, 58% of the implant valves in SOD3 (−) rats showed regurgitation (vs. 31% in controls, p = .2377). Intima hyperplasia and chondro‐osteogenic transformation contributed to progressive graft calcification ( p = .0024). At 12 weeks, hydroxyapatite deposition ( p = .0198) and the gene expression of runt‐related transcription factor‐2 (Runx2) ( p = .0093) were significantly enhanced in group SOD3 (−) . This study provides the first in vivo evidence that impaired systemic antioxidant activity contributes to biological cardiovascular graft degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4306669789,"Renal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs), which are closely related to regulation of vascular reactivity and modulation of inflammation, play a crucial role in the process of renal ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury. Previous studies have reported the protective effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) against renal I/R injury, but little is known about the role of DEX on RMECs. This study aimed to investigate whether DEX alleviated renal I/R injury via acting on the RMECs. Mice underwent bilateral renal artery clamping for 45 min followed by reperfusion for 48 h, and the cultured neonatal mice RMECs were subjected to hypoxia for 1 h followed by reoxygenation (H/R) for 24 h. The results suggest that DEX alleviated renal I/R injury in vivo and improved cell viability of RMECs during H/R injury in vitro. Gene sequencing revealed that the PI3K/Akt was the top enriched signaling pathway and the endothelial cells were widely involved in renal I/R injury. DEX activated phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt, increased eNOS expression, and attenuated inflammatory responses. In addition, the results confirmed the distribution of α2 adrenoreceptor (α2-AR) in RMECs. Furthermore, the protective effects of DEX against renal I/R injury were abolished by α2-AR antagonist (atipamezole), which was partly reversed by the PI3K agonist (740 Y-P). These findings indicated that DEX protects against renal I/R injury by activating the PI3K/Akt-eNOS pathway and inhibiting inflammation responses via α2-AR in RMECs."
