https://openalex.org/W1992454900,"IT is widely known that different individuals give very different reactions to the bites of insects, and also that repeated exposure may a ter the reactions of one individual (Boycott1, Hecht2), but surprisingly little work has been done on this subject. The availability of a group of human volunteer subjects for medical research made it possible to investigate the effect of the bites of various species on individuals who could be kept under observation for long periods."

T.) which has been found extremely useful in studying the movements of Elaterid beetles of the genus Agriotes Esch. As these beetles are known to fly but rarely in Britain, a study of the extent to which they may move by walking is of considerable interest."

https://openalex.org/W2059160669,"It is a well-known fact that the intravenous injection of high diabetogenic doses of alloxan (80–100 mgm. per kgm.) in the dog produces a very severe diabetic-uræmic syndrome. With such doses the death of the animals follows as a rule within one week, the cause of the death being probably due to the disturbance of the renal function1,2,3. In the course of our experiments on alloxan diabetes in the dog, we have been faced with this fact, which prevented us from keeping the animals with severe diabetes for further study. It was thought that clamping of the renal vessels previous to the alloxan injection, maintained a few minutes after the end of the injection, would avoid the kidney damage, since we have been able to demonstrate the rapid inactivation of the alloxan in contact with the blood and body tissues4. Our former experience shows, in fact that after ten minutes of contact with blood at 37° C. in vitro a diabetogenic dose of 100 mgm. alloxan per kgm. does not evoke its diabetogenic effect."

https://openalex.org/W2068944671,"In a previous communication1 we reported that the rate of glucose resorption from the small intestine of alloxan-diabetic animals is increased with the degree of diabetes, and that administration of insulin brings this rate down again to its normal value. Starting from the now proved fact that the rate of glucose resorption is dependent on the rate of phosphorylation, we examined whether alloxan-diabetic rats show an increase of the rate of phosphorylation. We found that the rate of glycogen phosphorylysis in muscles of alloxan-diabetic rats was increased by 63 per cent after 15 minutes and by 69 per cent after 30 minutes incubation time. By adding insulin in vitro, the rate of glycogen phosphorylation is diminished. We were able to confirm the results of Schumann2 and those of Verzar and Montigel3 that glycogen phosphorylysis in muscle of adrenalectomized rats is lowered."

https://openalex.org/W2079169768,"IT has been known since 1941 that sulphonamides influence the thyroid gland. MacKenzie, MacKenzie and MacCollum1 note that rats on a purified diet containing 1–2 per cent of sulphanilylguanidine show hypertrophy of the thyroid gland. The action is not influenced by yeast, p-aminobenzoic acid, or excess of iodine. Somewhat later2, sulphadiazine, sulphathiazole, sulphapyridine and sulphanilamide were found to produce a similar effect. Basal metabolism is lowered by any sulphonamide, and sulphanilamide is the least active one. Taurog, Chaikoff and Franklin3 showed that sulphonamides and similar products inhibit the formation of diiodotyrosine and thyroxin by living tissue slices of thyroid in vitro, in presence of radioactive inorganic iodine."

https://openalex.org/W1981860760,"WE wish to record the first known occurrence in the British Isles of Linognathus pedalis (Osborn), the foot louse of sheep. In June 1946 a heavy infestation of this parasite was reported by Mr. C. T. Murphy on the legs of a flock of a hundred cross-bred Suffolk sheep, near Colchester, Essex. The lice were identified in this laboratory as L. pedalis, and a part of the material has been placed in the collections at the British Museum (Natural History)."
https://openalex.org/W1995945603,"THE association between the adrenal glands and pathological pigmentation is well established, and it has been suggested that these glands may also control the physiological process1,2,3. The influence of sodium chloride on melanin formation in vitro has been demonstrated4, and it follows that if physiological pigmentation is controlled by this mechanism, then deeply pigmented animals should have a low chloride concentration. To confirm this the concentration of chloride in the blood of agouti and black mice has been investigated, using a cross between the CBA (Strong) and C57 (Little) strains which segregates for these colours."

https://openalex.org/W4244814150,"IN October 1944 the Standard Oil Development Co. in America made silver anniversary the occasion for a “Forum on the Future of Industrial Research”. The proceedings were issued by the Company in the following year in book form, and the volume makes intresting reading at the present time in view of topical discussions and trends in Great Britain. The papers and discussions centred round three themes: what should be the guiding principles and objectives for the commercial programmes of industrial research and development organisations; how small business can serve itself and be served by industrial research and development; and the place industrial research and development organisations should allocate to future work directed primarily toward national security. They thus canvassed questions that were afterwards discussed in Dr. Vannevar Bush's report, “Science: the Endless Frontier”, and one discussion at least covered the same theme as that of the conference arranged by the Manchester Joint Research Council for October 16, 1945, on “Research and the Smaller Firm”."
