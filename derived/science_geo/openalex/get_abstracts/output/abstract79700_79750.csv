https://openalex.org/W1516001873,"(Na,K)-ATPase in an active-transport protein that couples the energy obtained from the hydrolysis of ATP to the transport of Na+ and K+ across animal cell membranes. In order to investigate the enzymatic mechanism of this activity, a peptide derived from the ATP-binding site of (Na,K)-ATPase has been purified and its amino acid sequence has been determined. The peptide was identified by the covalent incorporation of a fluorescent probe, fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate, into the active site before trypsin digestion of the protein. The labeling of (Na,K)-ATPase by fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate was associated with the irreversible inhibition of enzymatic activity, and both the labeling of the tryptic peptide and inhibition of activity were prevented when the reaction was performed in the presence of ATP. An apparent KD of 5.7 microM was calculated when the reaction between (Na,K)-ATPase and fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate was performed under pseudo first-order conditions. The amino acid sequence of the active-site peptide, His-Leu-Leu-Val-Met-Lys-Gly-Ala-Pro-Glu-Arg, is similar to the sequence of a fluorescein-labeled peptide derived from the active site of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-transport ATPase (Mitchinson, C., Wilderspin, A. F., Trinaman, B. J., and Green, N. M. (1982) FEBS Lett. 146, 87-92)."
https://openalex.org/W1509551118,"Cardiac cells in culture (from rat and chick heart) have a membrane Na+/H+ exchange system that is inhibited by amiloride (K0.5 = 5 microM) and by its more potent N-5-disubstituted derivatives dimethylamiloride (K0.5 = 300 nM) and ethylisopropylamiloride (K0.5 = 30 nM). The properties of the cardiac Na+/H+ exchange system are similar to those found for the Na+/H+ exchanger in other cellular types. The Na+/H+ exchange system is a major pathway for Na+ uptake by cardiac cells. Ouabain which inhibits the (Na+,K+)-ATPase, a major pathway for Na+ efflux, is known to provoke Na+ accumulation and to stimulate 45Ca2+ entry via the Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism, thereby producing an inotropic effect. N-5-Disubstituted amiloride derivatives, by blocking Na+ entry into cardiac cells, antagonize both ouabain-induced intracellular Na+ accumulation and the ouabain-induced acceleration of 45Ca2+ uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1532195648,"The triphosphate form of 9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)-methyl]guanine (acyclovir), ACVTP, inactivates the herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA polymerase. ACVTP does not innately inactivate resting polymerase, but becomes an inactivator only while being processed as an alternative substrate. Pseudo first-order rates of inactivation were measured at varying concentrations of ACVTP and fixed concentrations of the natural substrate, deoxyguanosine triphosphate. These studies indicated that a reversible enzyme-ACVTP (Michaelis-type) complex is formed at the active site prior to inactivation. The formation of this complex was competitively retarded by deoxyguanosine triphosphate. An apparent dissociation constant (KD) of 3.6 +/- 0.2 (S.D.) nM was determined for ACVTP from this reversible complex. A second method for the estimation of the KD which used the extrapolated initial velocities produced a value of 5.9 +/- 0.4 (S.D.) nM. The rate of conversion of the reversible complex to the inactivated complex, at saturating ACVTP, was calculated to be 0.24 min-1. No reactivation of enzyme activity was detected following isolation of the inactivated complex by rapid desalting on Sephadex G-25. Under these conditions, an overall reactivation rate of 1.5 X 10(-5) min-1 could have been easily detected. Therefore, the overall inhibition constant must have been less than 3 pM. In contrast, when host DNA polymerase alpha was incubated with 14 microM ACVTP, only 60% inhibition of enzyme activity was observed, but inactivation was not detected. These data indicate that ACVTP functions as a suicide inactivator of the herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA polymerase, and is only a weak reversible inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1607177112,"The specific mammalian collagenase isolated from cultures of metastatic mouse PMT sarcoma cells cleaves murine procollagen IV into two segments, of approximate mass ratio 3:1. These fragments were separated by velocity sedimentation, visualized by electron microscopy, and analyzed. The longer COOH-terminal procollagen segment has a 270-nm collagenous portion with a knob at one end. This knob consists of the three previously identified, noncollagenous carboxyl propeptides, of approximately 30,000 daltons each. These carboxyl propeptides are chain-specific, and the three chains of each segment have the same amino to carboxyl orientation. The collagenase cuts through all three chains at one site, and the three-component chains of both the longer COOH-terminal procollagen segment and the shorter NH2-terminal procollagen segment are linked by interchain disulfide bridges. The enzyme cuts off the same COOH-terminal procollagen segment from procollagen IV monomers and tetramers, and the flexibility of this segment is similar to that of interstitial helices. The amino ends of the NH2-terminal procollagen segments derived from tetramers remain joined as the 32-nm long 7 S collagen junctional complex, and the remaining 89-nm long projecting threads are significantly more flexible than the COOH-terminal procollagen segment. The electrophoretic mobilities of the enzyme cleavage products are consistent with a heterotrimeric composition of this procollagen IV."
https://openalex.org/W1540707536,"Studies on the interaction of calcineurin with its activator, calmodulin, showed that the 1:1 complex is the activated species. Concomitant with activation, a time-dependent deactivation of the phosphatase was observed. The process followed first order kinetics and was dependent on the presence of both Ca2+ and calmodulin. The deactivation rate constant at pH 7.6 and 30 degrees C was 0.06 min-1, which was increased by the substrate, p-nitrophenylphosphate (Km = 11 mM), to 0.47 min-1. PPi and nucleotides inhibited the enzyme competitively and accelerated the deactivation. The first order rate constant was increased to 2.3 min-1 by PPi (Ki = 55 microM) and to 8.0 min-1 by ADP (Ki = 0.94 mM). A theory dealing with the deactivation (applicable to chemical modification, etc.) of an enzyme in the absence and presence of various ligands is presented. The deactivated enzyme remained bound to calmodulin and was not reactivated by dissociation-reassociation of the calcineurin-calmodulin complex. Calcineurin was found to contain covalently bound phosphate; however, no difference in its content was detected upon deactivation, indicating that self-dephosphorylation was not involved. The deactivation could be reversed, as well as prevented, by divalent metal ions such as Ni2+ and Mn2+. Atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed nearly stoichiometric amounts of tightly bound Fe and Zn (but little other ions) on purified calcineurin, which remained bound during the calmodulin-dependent deactivation; removal of tightly bound metals is, therefore, not the cause of deactivation. Our results indicate that calcineurin is a metallophosphatase and not simply a Ca2+- and calmodulin-stimulated enzyme. In addition to the nondissociable Zn and Fe and the Ca2+ bound to the B subunit and calmodulin, the enzyme requires a divalent metal ion for structural stability and full activity."

https://openalex.org/W1556340556,"The Escherichia coli dnaK+ gene was cloned into the runaway plasmid vector pMOB45 resulting in a large overproduction of the dnaK protein. The dnaK protein was purified by following its ability to complement the replication of single-stranded M13 bacteriophage DNA in a reaction system dependent on the presence of the lambda O and P DNA replication proteins. The DNA replication activity of the dnaK protein is also essential for lambda dv DNA replication in vitro, since antibodies against it were shown to inhibit the reaction. Purified dnaK protein preparations possess a weak ATPase activity and an autophosphorylating activity which copurify with its DNA replication activity throughout all purification steps. The dnaK protein is an acidic largely monomeric protein of Mr = 72,000 and 78,400 under denaturing and native conditions, respectively. The amino acid composition and N-terminal amino acid sequence match those predicted from the DNA sequence of the dnaK gene (Bardwell, J.C.A., and Craig, E. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 848-852)."
https://openalex.org/W1535470439,"Preincubation of turkey erythrocytes with beta-adrenergic agonists leads to an attenuation of the responsiveness of adenylate cyclase to subsequent hormonal stimulation. Recently, our laboratory has shown (Stadel, J. M., Nambi, P., Shorr, R. G. L., Sawyer, D. D., Caron, M. G., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 3173-3177) using 32Pi incorporation that phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor accompanies this desensitization process. We now report that, as determined from intracellular [gamma-32P] ATP specific activity measurements, this phosphorylation reaction occurs in a stoichiometric fashion. Under basal conditions there exists 0.75 +/- 0.1 mol of phosphate per mol of receptor whereas under maximally desensitized conditions this ratio increases to 2.34 +/- 0.13 mol/mol. This phosphorylation of the receptor is dose-dependent with respect to isoproterenol and exhibits a dose-response curve coincidental with that for isoproterenol-induced desensitization of adenylate cyclase. The time courses for receptor phosphorylation and adenylate cyclase desensitization are identical. In addition, the rate of resensitization of adenylate cyclase activity is comparable to the rate of return of the phosphate/receptor stoichiometries to control levels. Both the phosphorylation and desensitization reactions are pharmacologically specific as indicated by the high degree of stereoselectivity, rank order of catecholamines, and blockade by the specific beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. Incubation of turkey erythrocytes with cAMP and cAMP analogs maximally activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase but only partially mimics isoproterenol in promoting phosphorylation of the receptor in concordance with their partial effects in inducing desensitization. Conversely, activators or inhibitors of Ca2+/calmodulin kinase or protein kinase C do not affect the isoproterenol-induced desensitization. These results indicate that desensitization of turkey erythrocyte adenylate cyclase is highly correlated with phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor and that these events are mediated, at least partially, by cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1485256421,"A 414-base pair fragment from a Leishmania tarentolae kinetoplast DNA minicircle has unusual physical properties. We reported previously that in comparison to phi X174 and pBR322 control fragments, the kinetoplast fragment behaves in gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and electric dichroism experiments as if it has an unusually compact conformation. We accounted for these unusual properties by proposing that the fragment is a systematically bent helix (Marini, J.C., Levene, S.D., Crothers, D.M., and Englund, P.T. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 7664-7668). In this paper, we further explore the properties of the kinetoplast fragment. Because of its compact conformation, the kinetoplast fragment has difficulty in snaking through polyacrylamide gels and therefore migrates unusually slowly in electrophoresis experiments. Warming (53 degrees C) and ethanol (5-20%) partially normalize gel migration; glyoxal treatment results in denatured strands with electrophoretic mobility close to that expected for their size. In vivo modification does not appear to be responsible for the fragment's properties; its anomalous electrophoretic behavior persists after proteinase K treatment, phenol extraction, or after cloning into pBR322 and reisolation. Velocity sedimentation experiments rule out fragment aggregation. Secondary structure, such as a cruciform, is not detectable by S1 or mung bean nuclease digestion. The kinetoplast fragment has circular dichroism spectra characteristic of a B-type helix. With increasing temperature, there is an increase in the 270/280 ellipticity ratio. Circular dichroism spectra taken in the presence of ethanol show a B to A helix transition at unusually low ethanol concentrations (between 44 and 54% (w/w]. Thermal denaturation reveals a triphasic melting curve."
https://openalex.org/W1636454465,"The interaction between catecholamines and insulin in regulating glucose transport in isolated rat adipose cells has been evaluated. In the absence of insulin, 1 microM isoproterenol stimulates 3-O-methylglucose transport approximately 2-fold. However, isoproterenol in combination with adenosine deaminase inhibits glucose transport activity approximately 60%. N6-Phenylisopropyladenosine, a nonmetabolizable adenosine analogue, substantially reverses this inhibitory effect and actually stimulates glucose transport activity approximately 2-fold in the absence of isoproterenol. Dibutyryl cAMP inhibits glucose transport activity approximately 75% regardless of adenosine deaminase. While none of these agents significantly influences the basal concentration of plasma membrane glucose transporters, as assessed by specific D-glucose-inhibitable cytochalasin B binding, isoproterenol or dibutyryl cAMP in combination with adenosine deaminase reduces that in the low density microsomes 19 and 58%, respectively. In the presence of insulin, both isoproterenol and adenosine deaminase alone inhibit glucose transport activity approximately 25%. However, only the latter is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the insulin-stimulated concentration of plasma membrane glucose transporters. Together, isoproterenol and adenosine deaminase inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity approximately 75%, even in the presence of 5 mM glucose to maintain cellular ATP levels. A similar inhibition is observed with dibutyryl cAMP. However, these agents decrease the insulin-stimulated concentration of plasma membrane glucose transporters only approximately 45%. Nevertheless, all of these inhibitory effects occur through decreases in the transport Vmax. In addition, N6-phenylisopropyladenosine partially reverses the inhibitory effects induced by the presence of adenosine deaminase. These results suggest that catecholamines counter-regulate basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in rat adipose cells through a cAMP-mediated mechanism, but only in part by modulating the translocation of glucose transporters."
https://openalex.org/W1480605357,"We have isolated a strongly mitogenic, type beta transforming growth factor (beta TGF) released by Snyder-Theilen feline sarcoma virus-transformed rat embryo (FeSV-Fre) cells that induces phenotypic transformation of normal NRK cells when they are concomitantly stimulated by analogues of epidermal growth factor (EGF). Molecule filtration chromatography separates beta TGF from an EGF-like TGF (eTGF) which is also present in acid extracts from medium conditioned by FeSV-Fre cells (J. Massague, (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13606-13613). Final purification of beta TGF is achieved by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on octadecyl support, molecular filtration HPLC, and nonreducing dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis steps, yielding a 300,000-fold purified polypeptide with a final recovery of 21%. The purified rat beta TGF consists of two Mr = 11,000-12,000 polypeptide chains disulfide-linked as a Mr = 23,000 dimer. Induction of anchorage-independent proliferation of NRK cells by rat beta TGF depends on the simultaneous presence of eTGF or EGF. In the presence of a saturating (300 pM) concentration of either rat eTGF or mouse EGF, half-maximal anchorage-independent proliferation of NRK cells is obtained with 4-6 pM rat beta TGF. In the presence of a saturating (20 pM) concentration of rat beta TGF, half-maximal anchorage-independent proliferation of NRK cells is obtained with either rat eTGF or mouse EGF at a 50-70 pM concentration. Rat beta TGF is also able to induce DNA synthesis and cell proliferation on growth-arrested NRK, human lung, and Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblast monolayers, this effect being half-maximal at 2-3 pM beta TGF for NRK cells. These results identify eTGF and beta TGF as the two synergistically acting factors responsible for the transforming action of culture fluids from FeSV-Fre cells."
https://openalex.org/W1484673988,"Highly purified preparations of cytosolic brain RII contain a tightly associated polypeptide with a Mr of 75,000 (P75). When purified brain and heart RII were preincubated with Ca2+ and 125I-calmodulin and then were subjected to polyacrylamide gel gelectrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions a major calmodulin-binding component was found only in the brain RII sample. The calmodulin-binding activity exhibited a higher sedimentation coefficient (9 S) than free RII (5 S) indicating that it might be a complex of P75 and RII dimers. This possibility was investigated using two specific monoclonal antibodies. Western blot analyses revealed that monoclonal antibody 918 exclusively bound to P75 in the brain RII preparation while monoclonal antibody 107 complexed RII. The calmodulin-binding component was noncovalently labeled with 125I-calmodulin and separated from excess free RII by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. The identity of the polypeptides comprising the binding protein was subsequently established by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Polypeptides with Mrs values of 55,000 and 75,000 that bound monoclonal antibodies 107 and 918, respectively, were observed. Thus the calmodulin-binding component in brain RII preparations is a complex containing an RII dimer and one or two molecules of P75. P75 was also present in high concentrations in Triton X-100 extracts prepared from cerebral cortex and liver membranes. P75 is phosphorylated by both cAMP-dependent and calcium-phospholipid-activated protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1608488562,"We have studied the hepatic uptake of human [14C] cholesteryl oleate labeled acetyl low density lipoprotein (LDL). Acetyl-LDL injected intravenously into rats was cleared from the blood with a half-life of about 10 min. About 80% of the injected acetyl-LDL was recovered in the liver after 1 h. Initially, most of the [14C]cholesterol was recovered in liver endothelial cells (about 60%). Some radioactivity (about 15%) was also recovered in the hepatocytes, while the Kupffer cells and stellate cells contained only small amounts of the label (less than 5%). About 1 h after injection, radioactivity started to disappear from endothelial cells and appeared instead in hepatocytes. Radioactivity subsequently declined in hepatocytes as well. After a lag phase of 4 h, significant amounts of radioactivity were recovered in bile. The in vitro uptake and hydrolysis of [14C]cholesteryl oleate-labeled acetyl-LDL were saturable in isolated rat liver endothelial cells. Native LDL does neither affect the uptake nor the hydrolysis of acetyl-LDL. Ammonia and monensin reduced the hydrolysis of acetyl-LDL in isolated liver endothelial cells. Furthermore, monensin at concentrations above 10 microM completely blocked the binding of acetyl-LDL to the liver endothelial cells, suggesting that the receptor for acetyl-LDL is trapped inside the cells. The liver endothelial cells may be involved in the protection against atherogenic lipoproteins, e.g. liver endothelial cells may mediate uptake of cholesterol from plasma and transfer of cholesterol to the hepatocytes for further secretion into the bile."
https://openalex.org/W1589475186,"The D-2 dopamine receptor mediates inhibition of adenylate cyclase in rat intermediate lobe; this receptor is linked to cyclase by the inhibitory guanyl nucleotide-binding protein (Ni). The functioning of components in the inhibitory system was compared in control and pertussis toxin-treated tissues. (-)-N-n-Propylnorapomorphine ((-)-NPA), a dopamine agonist, and 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase in control tissue. Pertussis toxin abolished dopamine receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase but did not alter Gpp(NH)p-induced inhibition of cyclase. In control tissue, GTP blocked Gpp(NH)p inhibition of cyclase in the absence, but not in the presence of (-)-NPA. Following pertussis toxin treatment, GTP blocked the inhibitory effect of Gpp(NH)p either in the absence or in the presence of (-)-NPA. Pertussis toxin did not alter the number of dopamine receptors or the affinity of the receptor for [3H]spiroperidol, a dopamine antagonist. However, pertussis toxin decreased the potency of (-)-NPA in the binding assay and abolished the ability of GTP to affect agonist binding. Furthermore, pertussis toxin abolished the dopamine receptor-mediated inhibition of immunoreactive alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone release, and induced the ADP-ribosylation of the Mr = 41,000 subunit of Ni."

https://openalex.org/W1547011037,"Calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase from bovine brain is found to be composed of two distinct subunits, 60,000- and 63,000-dalton polypeptides. Peptide mapping of the subunits by partial proteolysis demonstrated that the 60-kDa polypeptide is not derived from the 63-kDa species. The interaction of the enzyme with three monoclonal antibodies, A6, C1, and A2, and the analysis of immunocomplexes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed that calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase exists in three different forms, i.e. (a) homodiamer of 60-kDa, (b) heterodimer of 60- and 63-kDa, and (c) homodimer of 63-kDa. A6 antibody reacts with both 60- and 63-kDa polypeptides indicating that they are immunologically related. C1 and A2 antibodies react with only 60-kDa polypeptide species. By using C1 Sepharose 4B affinity column chromatography, the 63-kDa homodimer which did not bind to the column (Fraction I) was separated from the 60-kDa polypeptide containing isozymes (the heterodimer and the 60-kDa homodimer) which were retained on the column and later eluted as a mixture (Fraction II). Fraction I, the 63-kDa homodimer enzyme, has higher Vmax toward cGMP as substrate than cAMP whereas the opposite was found with Fraction II. The specific activity of Fraction II enzyme toward cAMP was approximately 500 mumol/min/mg, the highest value ever reported for brain calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1572857016,"This study examines whether changes in cGMP concentration initiated by illumination of frog rod photoreceptors occur rapidly enough to implicate cGMP as an intermediate between rhodopsin activation in the disc membrane and permeability changes in the plasma membrane. Previous studies using whole retinas or isolated outer segments have provided conflicting evidence on the role of cGMP in the initial events of phototransduction. The rod photoreceptor preparation employed in this work consists of purified suspensions of outer segments still attached to the mitochondria-rich ellipsoid portion of the inner segment. These photoreceptors are known to retain normal electrophysiological responses to illumination and have cGMP levels comparable to those measured in the intact retina. When examined under several different conditions, changes in cGMP concentrations were found to occur as rapidly or more rapidly than the suppression of the membrane dark current. Subsecond changes in cGMP concentration were analyzed with a rapid quench apparatus and confirmed by comparison with a rapid freezing technique. In a 1 mM Ca2+ Ringer's solution, cGMP levels decrease to 65% of their final extent within 200 ms after bright illumination; changes in membrane dark current follow a similar time course. When the light intensity is decreased to 8000 rhodopsins bleached per rod per s, the light-induced cGMP decrease is completed within 50 ms, with 7 X 10(5) cGMP molecules hydrolyzed per rhodopsin bleached. During this time the dark current has not yet begun to change. Thus, under physiological conditions it is clear that changes in cGMP concentration precede permeability changes at the plasma membrane. The correlation of rapid changes in cGMP levels with changes in membrane current leave open the possibility that changes in cGMP concentration may be an obligatory step in the reaction sequence linking rhodopsin activation by light and the resultant decrease in sodium permeability of the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1522917327,"We have employed the technique of chromosome walking to determine the structure of 240 kilobases of amplified DNA surrounding the dihydrofolate reductase gene in methotrexate-resistant mouse cell lines. Within this region, we have found numerous DNA rearrangements which occurred during the amplification process. DNA subclones from regions flanking the dihydrofolate reductase gene were also utilized as hybridization probes in other cell lines. Our results show that: 1) amplification-specific DNA rearrangements or junctions are unique to each cell line; 2) within a given cell line, multiple amplification-specific DNA sequence rearrangements are found; 3) the degree of amplification of sequences flanking the dihydrofolate reductase gene shows quantitative variation among and within cell lines; and 4) both the arrangement of amplified sequences as well as the magnitude of gene amplification may vary with prolonged culture even under maintenance selection conditions. These studies indicate that there is no static repetitive unit amplified in these cells. Rather, a dynamic and complex arrangement of the amplified sequences exists which is continually changing."
https://openalex.org/W1516357030,"A431 cells have been used as an immunogen for generating monoclonal antibodies against the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Two immunoglobulin M and eight immunoglobulin G3 anti-EGF receptor antibodies were cloned. All ten antibodies immunoprecipitated biosynthetically labeled mature A431 cell EGF receptor and were able to recognize the receptor in Western blotting. However, none of the antibodies immunoprecipitated precursor polypeptides of the A431 cell EGF receptor, neither did they recognize EGF receptors from human foreskin fibroblasts, human placenta, nor a human-mouse hybrid cell expressing EGF receptor. The antibodies were found to bind to glycolipids from A431 cells and it was shown that the determinant involved was the blood group A antigen. It appears that this determinant is present on both the EGF receptor and glycolipids of A431 cells but is not expressed on EGF receptors from other human cells tested. One of the monoclonal antibodies raised was used for immunoaffinity purification of the EGF receptor. The procedure took advantage of the carbohydrate nature of the antigenic determinant by employing sugar-specific elution. The mild conditions permitted the purification of A431 cell EGF receptor (70-80% pure) that possessed an intrinsic EGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity with a specific activity of about 20 nmol/min/mg."
https://openalex.org/W1593876346,"Calcineurin purified from bovine brain was found to be active towards beta-naphthyl phosphate greater than p-nitrophenyl phosphate greater than alpha-naphthyl phosphate much greater than phosphotyrosine. In its native state, calcineurin shows little activity. It requires the synergistic action of Ca2+, calmodulin, and Mg2+ for maximum activation. Ca2+ and Ca2+ X calmodulin exert their activating effects by transforming the enzyme into a potentially active form which requires Mg2+ to express the full activity. Ni2+, Mn2+, and Co2+, but not Ca2+ or Zn2+, can substitute for Mg2+. The pH optimum, and the Vm and Km values of the phosphatase reaction are characteristics of the divalent cation cofactor. Ca2+ plus calmodulin increases the Vm in the presence of a given divalent cation, but has little effect on the Km for p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The activating effects of Mg2+ are different from those of the transition metal ions in terms of effects on Km, Vm, pH optimum of the phosphatase reaction and their affinity for calcineurin. Based on the Vm values determined in their respective optimum conditions, the order of effectiveness is: Mg2+ greater than or equal to Ni2+ greater than Mn2+ much greater than Co2+. The catalytic properties of calcineurin are markedly similar to those of p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity associated with protein phosphatase 3C and with its catalytic subunit of Mr = 35,000, suggesting that there are common features in the catalytic sites of these two different classes of phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1524301687,"The hepatic glucagon receptor was covalently labeled with [125I-Try10]monoiodoglucagon [( 125I]MIG) by use of the heterobifunctional cross-linker hydroxysuccinimidyl p-azidobenzoate. Labeling of the Mr = 63,000 peptide was sensitive to glucagon and GTP at concentrations at which they affect [125I]MIG binding to the receptor. The labeled receptor was solubilized with Lubrol-PX, and the hydrodynamic characteristics of the receptor were determined. The molecular parameters of the solubilized receptor are: S20,w = 4.3 +/- 0.1, Stokes radius = 6.3 +/- 0.1 nm, frictional coefficient f/f0 = 1.8, and a calculated Mr = 119,000. Incubation of liver membranes at 32 degrees C for 15 min prior to the addition of [125I]MIG permitted us to identify the high molecular weight form (Mr = approximately 113,000) of the receptor by direct sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoretic analysis. The Mr = 63,000 peptide can be adsorbed to wheat germ lectin-Sepharose. The glycoprotein nature of the receptor has been utilized to develop an assay for the detergent-solubilized receptor that uses wheat germ lectin-Sepharose as a solid matrix to adsorb the [125I] MIG-receptor complex. The free hormone remains in the liquid phase and is removed in the supernatant after low speed centrifugation. 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS) solubilizes receptors with retention of [125I]MIG binding activity. [125I]MIG binding to the CHAPS-solubilized receptor is specifically affected by unlabeled glucagon. Interaction of [125I]MIG with the soluble receptor is insensitive to the presence of GTP. IC50 for glucagon using the soluble receptor was 33-70 nM, irrespective of the presence or absence of GTP, while when the membrane-bound receptor was used, the IC50 in the absence of GTP was 2-4 nM and in the presence of GTP was 35-80 nM. These data allow us to conclude that the hepatic glucagon receptor in the membrane and in the nondenaturing detergent solution is a dimer of the Mr = 63,000 hormone-binding subunit and a glycoprotein. The soluble receptor does not display any functional interaction with the stimulatory regulator."
https://openalex.org/W1552627359,"An in vitro mitochondrial system, which makes use of intact yeast mitochondria, has been developed in order to study mitochondrial gene expression and its control by nuclear-coded proteins. Studies with this system have revealed that: isolated mitochondria synthesize polypeptide gene products which can be radiolabeled to high specific radioactivities when incubated in a protein-synthesizing medium that has been optimized with respect to each of its components; two energy-generating systems, endogenous oxidative phosphorylation and an exogenous ATP-regenerating system, support the highest level of protein synthesis; and the omission of an oxidizable substrate results in the synthesis of two new polypeptides (19.5 and 18 kDa) and a decrease in the amounts of cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II which are synthesized. They have also revealed that added adenine and guanine nucleotides increase the overall level of protein synthesis and that the added guanine nucleotides facilitate polypeptide chain elongation. Although isolated mitochondria which have been optimized for protein synthesis synthesize normal gene products (McKee, E. E., McEwen, J. E., and Poyton, R. O., (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 9332-9338) they still respond to an added dialyzed S-100 fraction from yeast cells by increasing their level of protein synthesis. This stimulation is observed in the presence of optimal concentrations of GTP, making it unlikely that guanyl nucleotides or enzymes which synthesize them are the sole stimulatory factors present in cellular cytosolic fractions, as suggested by Ohashi and Schatz (Ohashi, A., and Schatz, G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 7740-7745)."
https://openalex.org/W1550792250,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulates hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) by a phospholipase C (or phosphodiesterase) and elevates cytoplasmic-free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in GH3 pituitary cells. To explore whether hydrolysis of PtdIns-4,5-P2 is secondary to the elevation of [Ca2+]i, we studied the effects of Ca2+ ionophores, A23187 and ionomycin. In cells prelabeled with [3H]myoinositol, A23187 caused a rapid decrease in the levels of [3H]PtdIns-4,5-P2, [3H]PtdIns-4-P, and [3H]PtdIns to 88 +/- 2%, 88 +/- 4%, and 86 +/- 1% of control, respectively, and increased [3H]inositol bisphosphate to 200 +/- 20% at 0.5 min. There was no increase in [3H] Ins-P3; the lack of a measurable increase in [3H]Ins-P3 was not due to its rapid dephosphorylation. In cells prelabeled with [14C]stearic acid, A23187 increased [14C]diacylglycerol and [14C]phosphatidic acid to 166 +/- 20% and 174 +/- 17% of control, respectively. In cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid, A23187, but not TRH, increased unesterified [3H]arachidonic acid to 166 +/- 8% of control. Similar effects were observed with ionomycin. Hence, Ca2+ ionophores stimulate phosphodiesteratic hydrolysis of PtdIns-4-P but not of PtdIns-4,5-P2 and elevate the level of unesterified arachidonic acid in GH3 cells. These data demonstrate that Ca2+ ionophores affect phosphoinositide metabolism differently than TRH and suggest that TRH stimulation of PtdIns-4,5-P2 hydrolysis is not secondary to the elevation of [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1522690900,"The regulation of the hepatic uptake of chylomicron remnants and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) remnants was studied in the rat using a nonrecirculating liver perfusion system. The hepatic removal of remnant lipoproteins was shown to be by receptor-mediated processes since the concentration-dependent uptake was saturable and reductive methylation of the particles reduced the uptake of each lipoprotein by two-thirds. Treatment of liver donor rats with 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol resulted in a 2-fold increase in the hepatic uptake of VLDL remnants, while cholesterol feeding of liver donor rats caused complete suppression of the receptor-mediated uptake of VLDL remnants. Chylomicron remnant removal was unaffected by estradiol administration and only slightly diminished by cholesterol feeding. The results of competition studies also indicated that a specific chylomicron remnant receptor exists in the liver. Apoprotein E was shown to be required for the receptor-mediated uptake of both remnant lipoproteins. Chylomicron remnants which contained no apoprotein E and VLDL remnants which contained reductively methylated apoprotein E were removed by the liver to about one-third of the extent of native particles. Thus the hepatic uptake of remnant lipoproteins occurs by receptor-mediated processes and the specific removal of both particles is mediated by apoprotein E. In addition, the uptake of VLDL remnants is regulated by the same factors that control hepatic low-density lipoprotein removal, while chylomicron remnant removal is unaffected by these factors."
https://openalex.org/W1536456825,"We have used a variety of methods, including lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, proteolysis, and photolabel incorporation, to determine whether exposure to the acidic pH encountered during receptor-mediated endocytosis causes observable conformational changes in receptor proteins. Two receptor systems were chosen for this study: the asialoglycoprotein receptor and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. The purified asialoglycoprotein receptor protein was reconstituted into lipid membranes by spontaneous incorporation into phosphatidylcholine liposomes with the binding site facing outward. The EGF receptor was studied in living A-431 cells and was identified by immunoprecipitation using monoclonal antibodies. Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of both receptor systems, carried out with the external pH equal to 7.4 or 5.6, showed that the extent of receptor protein iodination was less at the lower pH even though lactoperoxidase has an acidic pH optimum. Using the nonspecific hydrophilic photolabeling agent [35S]N-(4-azido-3-nitrophenyl)-2-aminoethylsulfonic acid-taurine, we observed less incorporation into both the asialoglycoprotein receptor in liposomes and the EGF-receptor in A-431 cells when the external pH was reduced to 5.6. Also, using the enzyme papain, we have found that both receptors become resistant to proteolysis when the external pH is lowered from 7.0 to 5.6. These results suggest a conformational change in both of these receptors in which they become less exposed to the external aqueous environment at low pH. Such a conformational change may be responsible for the pH dependence of binding for both of these ligands. Also, this conformational change may serve to protect receptors from enzymatic degradation within endocytic or lysosomal compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1507209746,"The biosynthesis of osteonectin, a major glycoprotein of bone, has been studied in vitro using bone cells from fetal porcine calvariae. The calvarial cells, which were shown to produce osteonectin by immunotransfer and immunocytochemical analysis, were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine and the radiolabeled osteonectin in the cell layers and in the chase-medium was isolated by specific immunoprecipitation. The osteonectin, representing 0.1% of the radiolabeled cell layer and 1% of the medium proteins, co-migrated with authentic bovine osteonectin on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reduced and nonreduced conditions (Mr approximately 40,000), and was bound selectively to hydroxyapatite in the presence of 4 M guanidine HCl. The co-migration of the osteonectins indicates that the tissue-extracted osteonectin represents an intact protein and that a pro- form of osteonectin is unlikely. However, a preosteonectin form (Mr approximately 46,000) could be immunoprecipitated from cell-free translation of calvarial mRNA. The minimal secretion time for osteonectin synthesized in serum-containing medium was found to be approximately 40 min but maximal accumulation did not occur until 2 h postlabeling. In serum-free media, extensive degradation of osteonectin, characterized by the presence of two immunoprecipitable fragments (Mr approximately 36,000 and 31,000), was evident."
https://openalex.org/W1591612106,"Interferon-sensitive (IFN-S) and IFN-resistant (IFN-R) Daudi lymphoblastoid cells were studied for IFN-alpha receptor expression and regulation by steady state and kinetic procedures, utilizing a homogeneous 125I-IFN-alpha 2 probe. Heterogeneity in the binding of this probe to IFN-S cells was determined to result from negatively cooperative interactions between an initially homogeneous class of IFN receptor. No such heterogeneity was noted in the IFN-R cells, indicating an apparent difference in the interaction of IFN-alpha 2 with these cells. The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) for IFN-S cell receptors were calculated to be 1 X 10(-10) M and 1 X 10(-8) M, for the high and low affinity sites, respectively. The Kd for sites on the IFN-R cells was estimated to be 4 X 10(-9) M. IFN-R and IFN-S cells expressed 2.4 X 10(4) and 3.5 X 10(4) binding sites per cell, respectively, representing an increase of at least 6-fold over previous reports of IFN-S Daudi IFN receptor density. Both IFN-S and IFN-R cells were capable of down-regulating expression of the IFN-alpha receptor in response to low concentrations of IFN-alpha 2. Furthermore, both cell lines were shown to be capable of internalizing specifically bound 125I-IFN-alpha 2 to an equivalent degree. Accordingly, we propose that the relative insensitivity of the Daudi IFN-R phenotype involves the loss of a high affinity interaction between cellular receptors and IFN-alpha 2, in addition to the reduced level of expressed low affinity binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1571034940,"The effect of acetylglyceryl ether phosphorylcholine (AGEPC) on glycogenolysis and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate has been studied in rat hepatocytes. Previously, this laboratory demonstrated that AGEPC stimulated glucose output from the perfused rat liver and promoted the breakdown of phosphoinositides in rat hepatocytes (Shukla, S. D., Buxton, D. B., Olson, M.S., and Hanahan, D.J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10212-10214). In the present study, addition of AGEPC (10(-13) to 10(-9) M) to rat hepatocytes failed to stimulate glucose output, whereas epinephrine (10(-5)M) and glucagon (10(-7)M) stimulated glucose output by 100% or more in these same cells. The effects of AGEPC, epinephrine, vasopressin, and glucagon on glycogen phosphorylase activity and the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were compared in hepatocytes. AGEPC (10(-9)M) promoted the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in a fashion similar to epinephrine (10(-5)M) and vasopressin (10(-7)M). In contrast to the two calcium-mobilizing hormones, epinephrine and vasopressin, AGEPC did not cause an activation of glycogen phosphorylase. Glucagon activation of glycogen phosphorylase was not accompanied by a significant effect on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis. Thus, AGEPC is a chemical mediator which induces the degradation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate without activating glycogenolysis in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1511437540,"The mechanism of N6,O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (Bt2cAMP) induction of pro-vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)/PHM-27 biosynthesis was investigated in human neuroblastoma cells in culture. When neuroblastoma cells were grown for 48 h in the presence of 1 mM Bt2cAMP, the synthesis of pro-VIP/PHM-27 was stimulated 11-fold. The amount of prepro-VIP/PHM-27 mRNA determined both by hybridization with cloned prepro-VIP/PHM-27 cDNA and a reticulocyte cell-free translation assay was also increased 11-fold in the Bt2cAMP-induced cells. Transcription of prepro-VIP/PHM-27 mRNA in isolated nuclei was observed in induced cells, but not in uninduced cells. Blot hybridization with prepro-VIP/PHM-27 cDNA of total nuclear RNA isolated from neuroblastoma cells revealed an RNA species corresponding to mature prepro-VIP/PHM-27 mRNA, and the amount of the RNA was markedly increased in the induced cells. The quantity of VIP/PHM-27 gene in the DNA of neuroblastoma cells was analyzed after hydrolysis with a restriction endonuclease, EcoRI. However, VIP/PHM-27 gene was not amplified in the induced cells. These results indicate that Bt2cAMP-induced pro-VIP/PHM-27 synthesis is achieved by enhancing the transcription rate of prepro-VIP/PHM-27 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1605167663,"The structure of the mRNA for apolipoprotein II (apo-II), a major avian estrogen-responsive yolk protein, has been investigated. Primer extension using a cDNA probe-primer revealed six forms of mature apo-II mRNA. S1 and primer extension analysis with intron probes showed that only three of these forms arise due to multiple sites of transcription initiation on the apo-II gene. To investigate the basis for the additional forms of apo-II mRNA, we examined their nucleotide sequence. The sequence obtained between -10 and -42, relative to translation initiation, is identical to that reported by Wieringa et al. (Wieringa, B., AB, G., and Gruber, M. (1981) Nucleic Acids Res. 9, 469-499). At position -43, however, sequence heterogeneity appears. The minor form of the sequence starting at -43 and extending in a 5' direction corresponds exactly to the published mRNA sequence. The major form of the sequence has the insertion, 5'-CAG-3', at this position. The apparent basis for this heterogeneity is an unusual intron-exon border which violates the consensus sequence found in comparable positions in most eukaryotic genes by the existence of two adjacent 5'-CAG-3' triplets after the pyrimidine (Y)-rich track. The processing ratio between intron removal at the upstream and downstream AG dinucleotide is approximately 2.5:1. This result demonstrates that the splicing mechanism allows spatial flexibility in the positioning of the highly conserved YAG triplet within the consensus sequence at the 3' splice site."
https://openalex.org/W1557005194,"Intracellular localization of two molecular species of calpain (Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteinase) was studied by immunocyto- and histochemical methods employing antibodies strictly monospecific for the respective antigens. Apparent immunological cross-reactivity between the larger subunits of calpain I (low Ca2+-requiring form) and calpain II (high Ca2+-requiring form) was calculated to be 15-17%, and two steps of affinity chromatography were needed to obtain antibodies which can discriminate between the two proteases. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of cultured PK 15 cells revealed diffuse staining of the cytoplasm with both antibodies against calpain I and calpain II. Preincubation with Ca2+-ionophore had no effect on the staining patterns. Sections of porcine kidney were stained by the avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex method. The proximal and distal tubules and collecting duct were stained, but the glomerulus, macula densa, and vascular vessels were not stained by either anti-calpain I or anti-calpain II antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1581031885,"The complete gene encoding yeast ribosomal protein 29, a component of the 60 S ribosomal subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been isolated and its nucleotide sequence determined. The coordinates of transcription initiation and termination of the rp29 gene have been mapped. Transcription appears to start at several sites, spanning nearly 30 nucleotides. The gene is transcribed into a precursor RNA molecule of 1110 to 1085 nucleotides from which an intron of 458 nucleotides is spliced out. The splice junction has been determined by comparing the nucleotide sequences of the rp29 gene with those of a homologous cDNA clone. Interestingly, the intron of the rp29 gene resides in the 5' untranslated region of the rp29 mRNA, the first instance where this has been observed in yeast. The single open reading frame in the rp29 gene encodes a very basic protein of 155 amino acid residues."
https://openalex.org/W1911488345,"Using cultured GH1 cells, a growth hormone and prolactin-producing rat pituitary cell line, we have shown that n-butyrate and other short chain carboxylic acids stimulate histone acetylation and elicit a reduction of thyroid hormone nuclear receptor which is inversely related to the extent of acetylation (Samuels, H. H., Stanley, F., Casanova, J., and Shao, T. C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2499-2508). In this study, we compared the n-butyrate and propionate modulation of receptor levels to regulation of the growth hormone and prolactin response by 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (L-T3). n-Butyrate (0.1-10 mM) did not stimulate growth hormone production. L-T3 stimulated the growth hormone response 4- to 5-fold and n-butyrate (0.5-1 mM) increased L-T3 stimulation of growth hormone production 1.5- to 2-fold compared to L-T3 alone. L-T3 stimulation of growth hormone production at higher n-butyrate concentrations decreased in parallel with the n-butyrate-mediated reduction of receptor levels. In contrast with the growth hormone response, n-butyrate (0.5 mM) increased basal prolactin production about 5-fold. Prolactin production, which is inhibited 25 to 50% by L-T3, was stimulated between 20- and 70-fold by L-T3 + n-butyrate (0.5-1 mM) and this decreased at higher n-butyrate levels. Prolactin mRNA and growth hormone mRNA levels paralleled the changes in prolactin and growth hormone production rates. These effects of L-T3, n-butyrate, or L-T3 + n-butyrate appeared unrelated to changes in cAMP levels or global changes in DNA methylation of the growth hormone or prolactin genes. Propionate elicited the same effects as n-butyrate but at a 5- to 10-fold higher concentration consistent with their relative effect on stimulating acetylation of chromatin proteins. These results suggest that prolactin gene expression is under partial regulatory repression which is reversed by a carboxylic acid-mediated postsynthetic modification event which allows for stimulation of the prolactin gene by thyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1506519761,"We have constructed cDNA clones from size-selected mRNA of developing soybean seeds to identify genes encoding the Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor. Recombinant clones containing sequences coding for the Bowman-Birk inhibitor were identified by mRNA hybrid selected translation and immunoprecipitation. The nucleotide sequence of the insert of plasmid pB38 corresponds to the mRNA for the Bowman-Birk inhibitor, although it is missing a portion of the coding sequence at the 5' end. Northern hybridization analysis of total RNA isolated from developing soybean seeds showed that the mRNA for the inhibitor is approximately 450 nucleotides long and that it accumulates early in embryogeny. Southern hybridization analysis of restriction enzyme-digested soybean nuclear DNA indicated that the gene encoding the Bowman-Birk inhibitor is not highly reiterated in the genome. We have isolated a gene encoding the Bowman-Birk inhibitor from a soybean genomic library constructed in Charon 4A. DNA sequence analysis of the genomic clone reveals that it is similar, although not identical, to the cDNA clone and that it contains no intervening sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1677616940,"The cross-linking reagents succinimidyl-4-(p-maleimidophenyl)-butyrate and N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate were used to covalently attach antibodies against human erythrocytes to the thiol-containing paraffin, dodecanethiol. The complex formed, dodecanethiol-maleimidophenylbutyrate (or pyridyldithiopropionate)-antibody was inserted into the membranes of reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes. This was achieved by addition of the dodecanethiol-maleimidophenylbutyrate-antibody to a detergent solution (Triton X-100) containing the viral envelope phospholipids and glycoproteins. Removal of the detergent led to the formation of vesicles containing the viral glycoprotein and the dodecanethiol-maleimidophenylbutyrate (or pyridyldithiopropionate)-antibody complexes within the same membrane. Reconstituted Sendai virus envelope-bearing antibodies against human erythrocytes were able to fuse with human erythrocytes (as was reflected by reconstituted Sendai virus envelope-induced hemolysis) from which the natural virus receptors were removed by treatment with neuraminidase. Thus, it appears that anti-human erythrocyte antibodies could substitute for the viral binding protein (hemagglutinin/neuraminidase glycoprotein) in mediating functional binding of the virus particles to the cell plasma membranes. Furthermore, from the results of the present work, it may be inferred that in addition to being the viral-binding protein, hemagglutinin/neuraminidase glycoprotein actively participates in the process of virus-cell fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1591268310,"Effects of divalent cations on the regulation of glucose transport and cAMP phosphodiesterase in isolated rat epididymal adipocytes were studied. EDTA (5 mM) moderately inhibited the binding of insulin to adipocytes in Krebs-Henseleit Hepes buffer. In the same buffer, A-23187 (an ionophore specific for divalent cations; 50 microM) plus EDTA (5 mM) almost completely blocked the insulin- or hydrogen peroxide-dependent stimulation of phosphodiesterase. This inhibition was not secondary to the loss of ATP. When cells that had been treated with A-23187 plus EDTA were washed and then exposed to 1-10 mM of divalent cations, the cellular phosphodiesterase activity was elevated. Mn2+ was most stimulatory, Mg2+ was next, and Ca2+ was least effective. The stimulatory effects were enhanced by insulin. In the presence of insulin, Mn2+ at 10 mM was less stimulatory than that at 1 mM. In regular Krebs-Henseleit Hepes buffer, Mn2+ greatly stimulated phosphodiesterase if cells were first exposed to A-23187. The Mn2+-dependent stimulation was blocked by treatment of cells with 2,4-dinitrophenol. Results essentially parallel to those described above were also obtained when the rate of glucose transport was determined. The above results indicate that divalent cations mildly support the extracellular binding of insulin to its receptor, facilitate the physiological actions of insulin, and mimic the hormone actions, presumably by stimulating an intracellular enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2102540587,"We have developed a reverse-phase HPLC method to purify 125I-labeled products resulting from the chloramine-T-based iodination of glucagon and have used the products [(125I)iodoTyr13]glucagon, [(125I)iodoTyr10,13]glucagon, and [(125I)iodoTyr10]glucagon) to study the receptor binding of glucagon and the cell-mediated metabolism of the hormone by isolated canine hepatocytes. The extent of binding of the three labeled glucagons to cell receptors differed at steady state (8.5, 11.9, and 12.6% of the three peptides, respectively, becoming cell-associated), but each of the labeled glucagons approached steady state binding at the same rate. Further, unlabeled glucagon competed for the binding of each of the labeled peptides in parallel under steady state conditions, and each of the peptides showed potent activity in inhibiting [14C]fructose incorporation into glycogen. Gel filtration of the acetic acid-extracted, cell-associated products of radiolabeled glucagon binding revealed 10-20% of the material as a shoulder on the descending limb of the peak of hormone for each of the three labeled peptides. Trypsin digestion of the lower molecular weight peptide derived from [(125I)iodoTyr13]glucagon resulted in a fragment containing residues 13 to 17 as the only detectable radiolabeled product. On the other hand, trypsin digestion of the analogous peptide derived from [(125I)iodoTyr10]glucagon revealed, in addition to the radiolabeled fragment containing residues 1 to 12, a major fragment identified by radiosequence analysis to contain residues 4 to 12 and a minor fragment identified to contain residues 7 to 12. We conclude that (a) notwithstanding apparent differences in affinities exhibited by [(125I)iodoTyr13]glucagon, [(125I)iodoTyr10,13]glucagon, and [(125I)iodoTyr10]glucagon for binding to canine hepatocytes, the interactions of all three peptides with the glucagon receptor are functionally equivalent, and (b) the cell-mediated metabolism of receptor-bound glucagon involves the formation of hormone-derived peptides in which the biologically important NH2-terminal region of the hormone has been modified by limited proteolytic cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1524032955,"3T3 cells have a large, pericellular coat which contains 30 times more hyaluronate than the amount of cell surface hyaluronate associated with simian virus 40-transformed 3T3 (SV-3T3) cells. On the other hand, SV-3T3 cells have high affinity binding sites for exogenously added hyaluronate, whereas 3T3 cells have much lower affinity sites. Removal of cell surface hyaluronate from SV-3T3 cells by treatment with hyaluronidase caused a reproducible increase in their maximum binding capacity for exogenous hyaluronate but no significant change in binding affinity or specificity. For 3T3 cells, however, the maximum amount of binding decreased and the affinity of binding increased after hyaluronidase treatment. When endogenous cell surface hyaluronate was labeled metabolically and then the cells incubated in the presence of exogenous unlabeled hyaluronate, the labeled cell surface hyaluronate was quantitatively displaced from the SV-3T3 cells but was not displaced from the 3T3 cells. Chondroitin sulfate and heparin did not displace cell surface hyaluronate from either cell type. Membranes isolated from SV-3T3 cells bound hyaluronate specifically and with high affinity, whereas membranes from 3T3 cells did not consistently bind a significant amount of hyaluronate. We conclude from these studies that the retention of endogenous hyaluronate on the surface of SV-3T3 cells is mediated by binding sites similar to those detected by the addition of exogenous hyaluronate, and the mechanism of retention of endogenous hyaluronate on the surface of 3T3 cells differs from SV-3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1548084873,"Our approach to the modeling of beta-endorphin has been based on the proposal that three basic structural units can be distinguished in the natural peptide hormone: a highly specific opiate recognition sequence at the N terminus (residues 1-5) connected via a hydrophilic link (residues 6-12) to a potential amphiphilic helix in the C-terminal residues 13-31. Our previous studies showed the validity of this approach and have demonstrated the importance of the amphiphilic helical structure in the C terminus of beta-endorphin. The present model, peptide 5, has been designed in order to evaluate further the requirements of the amphiphilic secondary structure as well as to determine the importance of this basic structural element as compared to more specific structural features which might occur in the C-terminal segment. For these reasons, peptide 5 retains the three structural units previously postulated for beta-endorphin; the major difference with regard to previous models is that the whole C-terminal segment, residues 13-31, has been built using only D-amino acids. In aqueous buffered solutions as well as in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol-containing solutions, the CD spectra of peptide 5 show the presence of a considerable amount of left-handed helical structure. Enzymatic degradation studies employing rat brain homogenate indicate that peptide 5 is stable in this milieu. In delta- and mu-opiate receptor-binding assays, peptide 5 shows a slightly higher affinity than beta-endorphin for both receptors while retaining the same delta/mu selectivity. In opiate assays on the guinea pig ileum, the potency of peptide 5 is twice that of beta-endorphin. In the rat vas deferens assay, which is very specific for beta-endorphin, peptide 5 displays mixed agonist-antagonist activity. Most remarkably, peptide 5 displays a potent opiate analgesic effect when injected intracerebroventricularly into mice. At equal doses, the analgesic effect of peptide 5 is less than that of beta-endorphin (10-15%) but longer lasting. In conjunction with our previous model studies, these results clearly demonstrate that the amphiphilic helical structure in the C terminus of beta-endorphin is of predominant importance with regard to activity in rat vas deferens and analgesic assays. The similarity between the in vitro and in vivo opiate activities of beta-endorphin and peptide 5, when compared to the drastic change in chirality in the latter model, demonstrates that even a left-handed amphiphilic helix formed by D-amino acids can function satisfactorily as a structural unit in a beta-endorphin-like peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1592306001,A genomic library of the winter flounder in lambda phage Charon 4 was screened with antifreeze protein cDNA. Nine genomic clones were isolated from three haploid genome equivalents of phage and were grouped into three classes on the basis of restriction mapping and heteroduplex analysis. The three chromosomal regions are non-overlapping and each contain two antifreeze protein genes spaced from 3 to 7 kilobase pairs apart. Genomic Southern blots indicate that these six non-allelic genes represent only 10-20% of the complement of this large multigene family. One gene has been identified by sequencing as a variant of the gene encoding the most abundant antifreeze protein. This gene is 1.0 kilobase pair long and contains an intervening sequence of 0.6 kilobase pairs between the coding region for the bulk of the signal sequence and that coding for the proprotein.

We observed a biphasic peak of albumin production, with the first peak at 4-6 and the second at 10-20 days after plating. A 2- to 3-fold increase in the second peak was observed when albumin production by SV40-infected cultures was compared with that by uninfected cultures. No increase in cell number in SV40-infected cultures was observed during this 20-day period. By 25-35 days, albumin production by uninfected cultures ceased but was detected in 50-60% of SV40-infected cultures. SV40-induced stimulation and persistence occurred regardless of the attachment surface and did not require collagen. Transformation occurred regardless of whether stimulation or persistence of albumin production was seen; however, stimulation and persistence were necessary to yield transformed cultures that produced albumin."
https://openalex.org/W1481858976,"An inhibitor of procine brain calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase was purified about 940-fold from rat testis. This inhibitor inhibited the calmodulin-induced activation of the enzyme without affecting its basal activity. The inhibitor activity was counteracted by a high concentration of calmodulin, but was not by a high concentration of Ca2+. The analysis on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the inhibitor and calmodulin form a complex in the presence of Ca2+ but not in the presence of excess amount of EGTA. This inhibitor also inhibited the calmodulin-induced activation of Ca2+, Mg2+ -ATPase of human erythrocytes. The inhibitor appeared to be a heat-stable protein, since the inhibitor activity was not attenuated by boiling up to 9 min but was completely abolished by tryptic or chymotryptic digestion. The molecular weights of the inhibitor determined by linear polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were 40,000 and 32,000, respectively. Thus, the inhibitor is suggested to be a calmodulin-binding protein composed of a monomer which has unique properties different from those of other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1587924920,"Investigations of developmental changes in energy metabolism in guinea pig liver mitochondria showed that mitochondria from the newborn were well coupled, with respiratory control ratios and membrane energy potentials similar to those obtained with mitochondria from the 1-day-old and the adult. In contrast, there was a 3-fold increase in the rate of mitochondrial respiration and a 2-fold increase in adenine nucleotide content during the first 24 h of extrauterine life. There was no significant change in the ATP/ADP ratio and only a 30% increase in the uncoupled rate of respiration during this same time period. Titrations of the adenine nucleotide translocase with the specific inhibitor, carboxyatractyloside, showed that the newborn had only 50% of the adenine nucleotide translocase activity of the adult. Furthermore, by applying flux control theory to these inhibitor titrations, it was possible to demonstrate that the adenine nucleotide translocase exerted greater control over respiration in the newborn than in the adult, and at maximal rates of coupled respiration the translocase had a control strength of 0.98. The consequences of this finding on cellular energy metabolism are discussed in relation to adaptation of the newborn to extrauterine life."

The extent and rate of phosphorylation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-P2) by yeast cAMP-dependent protein kinase were dependent on fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase inhibitors, 5'-AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2). In the absence of inhibitor, the enzyme was slowly phosphorylated with a maximum incorporation of 1 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme. The presence of both inhibitors greatly increased the phosphorylation rate with a maximum incorporation of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme. The presence of only one inhibitor led to an intermediate rate of phosphorylation with 2 mol of phosphate incorporated/mol of enzyme. There was no significant change in enzymatic activity after phosphorylation. The estimated sedimentation coefficient of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was lowered by 5'-AMP from 8.2 to 5.7 while Fru-2,6-P2 increased the S value to 8.5. The presence of either Fru-1,6-P2 or Fru-2,6-P2 prevented the 5'-AMP lowering of S value. The susceptibility of enzyme to partial tryptic digestion was not changed by the presence of 5'-AMP. The presence of both Fru-2,6-P2 and 5'-AMP led to the protection of Mr = 35,000 subunit from tryptic digestion while Fru-2,6-P2 alone led to a protection of an Mr = 30,000 peptide fragment. This peptide fragment did not contain the phosphorylation sites. Our results suggest that the rapid regulation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase following glucose addition is controlled mainly by enzyme inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1593687942,"The activity of alpha-thrombin and chemically modified derivatives of this enzyme in stimulating cGMP formation in murine neuroblastoma clone N1E-115 cells is reported. The rank order potency of the compounds falls into three classes: 1) alpha-thrombin is the most potent and effective; 2) the catalytically active enzymes gamma-thrombin, trypsin, and nitro-alpha-thrombin are approximately 50-fold less potent than alpha-thrombin; and 3) active site blocked derivatives of alpha-thrombin are 100 to 1000-fold less potent than alpha-thrombin. Native alpha-thrombin consistently produces the most effective response, usually 1.5 to 3-fold greater than any of the other compounds tested. Preincubation of cells with quinacrine, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2, or with the lipoxygenase inhibitors 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid or nordihydroguaiaretic acid prior to thrombin challenge resulted in a concentration-dependent attenuation of the response. Indomethacin was without effect in modifying the response. These results suggest that thrombin stimulation of neuroblastoma cells involves the release of arachidonic acid and its metabolism by lipoxygenase. These results clearly demonstrate the activity of alpha-thrombin in stimulating a receptor-mediated response in cultured nerve cells. The results are discussed in relation to the interaction of endogenous alpha-thrombin with nerve cells following invasive trauma and to the possible presence of endogenous proteinases with a neurotransmitter-like function."
https://openalex.org/W1562499982,"The promoter region of Bacillus subtilis subtilisin E was found to be composed of two overlapping promoters with their transcription starting sites separated from each other by 15 base pairs (Wong, S.-L., Price, C. W., Goldfarb, D. S., and Doi, R. H. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 1184-1188). At least one of the promoters is transcribed by a minor form of B. subtilis RNA polymerase with a sigma factor of 37,000 daltons. In vitro transcription analyses and in vivo studies with promoter probe plasmids pKO-1 and pCED-6 demonstrated that Escherichia coli RNA polymerase was able to initiate transcription from the subtilisin promoter cluster. S1 nuclease-mapping studies with both in vivo and in vitro transcribed RNA from E. coli and B. subtilis illustrate that E. coli can initiate transcription from both promoters with the same transcription start points as B. subtilis. The promoter strength of this promoter cluster in E. coli, as expressed in terms of galactokinase units, was 64 units and represents weak promoter activity in the E. coli system. These data indicate that either the single E. coli RNA polymerase is able to recognize the minor sigma 37 promoter or E. coli contains a hitherto unrecognized minor RNA polymerase holoenzyme which is capable of recognizing a B. subtilis sigma 37 promoter. On the other hand the B. subtilis RNA polymerase holoenzymes have been quite promoter-specific in our experiments to date."
https://openalex.org/W1512524390,"Adenylate kinase from Escherichia coli K12 (strains CR341 and CR341 T28, a temperature-sensitive mutant) was purified by a two-step chromatographic procedure. Denaturation by heat above 60 degrees C of pure or crude preparations of adenylate kinase from both strains of bacteria was shown to be reversible if the enzyme was converted to the random coiled state by guanidinium chloride after heat treatment. Like other small monomeric proteins, adenylate kinase refolded rapidly to the native active state by dilution of guanidinium chloride. Adenylate kinase from the mutant strain was irreversibly inactivated by exposure of crude extracts at 40 degrees C. This inactivation is due to proteolysis which follows thermal denaturation (or transconformation) of mutant adenylate kinase at 40 degrees C. ATP, P1, P5-di(adenosine 5')-pentaphosphate, and anti-adenylate kinase antibodies protected the thermosensitive adenylate kinase in crude extracts against denaturation and proteolysis at 40 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1487398561,"Abstract To assess the relative of individual ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) in the large and small subunits of the bovine mitochondrial ribosome, we used a double label iodination technique. Regions of r-proteins in purified ribosomal subunits were labeled with 131I using the lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination system, and additional reactive groups available upon denaturing the r-proteins in urea were labeled with 125I using the chloramine-T mediated reaction. The ratio of 131I to 125I incorporated into individual proteins under these conditions is representative of the degree of for each of the proteins in the subunits. In this manner, the r-proteins have been grouped into 3 classes depending on their degree of exposure: high exposure, exposure, and essentially buried. While both subunits have a few proteins in the highly exposed group, and a large number of proteins in the intermediate exposure group, only the large ribosomal subunit has an appreciable number of proteins which appear essentially buried. The more buried proteins may serve mainly structural roles, perhaps acting as assembly proteins, since many from this group bind to ribosomal RNA. The more superficially disposed proteins may comprise binding sites for macromolecules that interact with ribosomes during protein synthesis, as well as stabilizing the association of the large and small subribosomal particles."
https://openalex.org/W1590609621,"Preliminary x-ray data have been obtained from large single crystals of pig kidney fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, grown from polyethylene glycol. The crystals have the symmetry of space group P3(1)21 or its enantiomorph P3(2)21, contain two subunits of the 146,000-dalton tetramer/asymmetric unit, and diffract to 2.9-A resolution on still photographs. The unit cell dimensions are a = b = 132.5 A and c = 68.0 A. Small single crystals have been grown in the presence of the inhibitor fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, with and without the allosteric effector AMP added. Crystals grown in the presence of both ligands are isomorphous with native crystals and generate diffraction patterns that show significant intensity changes."
