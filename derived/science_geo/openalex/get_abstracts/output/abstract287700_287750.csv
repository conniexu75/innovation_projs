https://openalex.org/W2095362488,"The ability to fabricate nanometer-sized structures that are stable in air has the potential to contribute significantly to the advancement of new nanotechnologies and our understanding of nanoscale systems. Laser light can be used to control the motion of atoms on a nanoscopic scale. Chromium atoms were focused by a standing-wave laser field as they deposited onto a silicon substrate. The resulting nanostructure consisted of a series of narrow lines covering 0.4 millimeter by 1 millimeter. Atomic force microscopy measurements showed a line width of 65 +/- 6 nanometers, a spacing of 212.78 nanometers, and a height of 34 +/-+ 10 nanometers. The observed line widths and shapes are compared with the predictions of a semiclassical atom optical model."

Large cages of In(74) (D3h) and M(60) (= In(48)Na(12), D3d) share pentagonal faces to generate a double-hexagonal close-packed analog of NiAs. All these polyhedra are centered by partially disordered In(10)Z clusters within deltahedra of sodium atoms that cap all inner faces of the cages, namely, Z@In(10)@Na(39)@In(74) and Z@In(10)@Na(32)@Na(12)In(48) ""onions"" The highest filled bands in these compounds apparently involve localized electron pairs on surface features on In(74)-based layers. Structural and electronic relations between diamond and Naln (stuffed diamond structure) parallel those between certain fullerenes and Na(96)In(97)Z(2) and, presumably, other valence-driven intermetallic phases."

https://openalex.org/W2094740303,"The Cosmic Background Explorer satellite has recently made the most accurate measurement of the temperature of the universe, determining it to be 2.726 ± 0.01 kelvin. In trying to understand why the temperature has this value, one is led to discover the most fundamental features of the universe—an early, radiation-dominated epoch, enormous entropy per nucleon, synthesis of the light elements around 3 minutes after the bang, and a small excess of matter over antimatter—as well as some of the most pressing issues in cosmology today—the development of structure in the universe and the identification of the nature of the ubiquitous dark matter."
