https://openalex.org/W2905447079,"In vitro cancer cultures, including three-dimensional organoids, typically contain exclusively neoplastic epithelium but require artificial reconstitution to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment (TME). The co-culture of primary tumor epithelia with endogenous, syngeneic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as a cohesive unit has been particularly elusive. Here, an air-liquid interface (ALI) method propagated patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from >100 human biopsies or mouse tumors in syngeneic immunocompetent hosts as tumor epithelia with native embedded immune cells (T, B, NK, macrophages). Robust droplet-based, single-cell simultaneous determination of gene expression and immune repertoire indicated that PDO TILs accurately preserved the original tumor T cell receptor (TCR) spectrum. Crucially, human and murine PDOs successfully modeled immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with anti-PD-1- and/or anti-PD-L1 expanding and activating tumor antigen-specific TILs and eliciting tumor cytotoxicity. Organoid-based propagation of primary tumor epithelium en bloc with endogenous immune stroma should enable immuno-oncology investigations within the TME and facilitate personalized immunotherapy testing."

Systems-level analysis of how flaviviruses hijack cellular processes through virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) provides information about their replication and pathogenic mechanisms. We used affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to compare flavivirus-host interactions for two viruses (DENV and ZIKV) in two hosts (human and mosquito). Conserved virus-host PPIs revealed that the flavivirus NS5 protein suppresses interferon stimulated genes by inhibiting recruitment of the transcription complex PAF1C and that chemical modulation of SEC61 inhibits DENV and ZIKV replication in human and mosquito cells. Finally, we identified a ZIKV-specific interaction between NS4A and ANKLE2, a gene linked to hereditary microcephaly, and showed that ZIKV NS4A causes microcephaly in Drosophila in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. Thus, comparative flavivirus-host PPI mapping provides biological insights and, when coupled with in vivo models, can be used to unravel pathogenic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2904210096,"Vibrio cholerae uses a quorum-sensing (QS) system composed of the autoinducer 3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-ol (DPO) and receptor VqmA (VqmAVc), which together repress genes for virulence and biofilm formation. vqmA genes exist in Vibrio and in one vibriophage, VP882. Phage-encoded VqmA (VqmAPhage) binds to host-produced DPO, launching the phage lysis program via an antirepressor that inactivates the phage repressor by sequestration. The antirepressor interferes with repressors from related phages. Like phage VP882, these phages encode DNA-binding proteins and partner antirepressors, suggesting that they, too, integrate host-derived information into their lysis-lysogeny decisions. VqmAPhage activates the host VqmAVc regulon, whereas VqmAVc cannot induce phage-mediated lysis, suggesting an asymmetry whereby the phage influences host QS while enacting its own lytic-lysogeny program without interference. We reprogram phages to activate lysis in response to user-defined cues. Our work shows that a phage, causing bacterial infections, and V. cholerae, causing human infections, rely on the same signal molecule for pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2904827199,"Transcriptional regulation in metazoans occurs through long-range genomic contacts between enhancers and promoters, and most genes are transcribed in episodic “bursts” of RNA synthesis. To understand the relationship between these two phenomena and the dynamic regulation of genes in response to upstream signals, we describe the use of live-cell RNA imaging coupled with Hi-C measurements and dissect the endogenous regulation of the estrogen-responsive TFF1 gene. Although TFF1 is highly induced, we observe short active periods and variable inactive periods ranging from minutes to days. The heterogeneity in inactive times gives rise to the widely observed “noise” in human gene expression and explains the distribution of protein levels in human tissue. We derive a mathematical model of regulation that relates transcription, chromosome structure, and the cell’s ability to sense changes in estrogen and predicts that hypervariability is largely dynamic and does not reflect a stable biological state."

Engrams are the specific changes in the brain that are formed by experience (Semon, 1921Semon R.W. The mneme.

Memory engram storage and retrieval.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2015; 35: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Stability of engram cell connectivity contributes to memory storage and is therefore necessary for the normal process of memory retrieval. But the efficacy of memory retrieval is strongly influenced by environmental factors such as cue availability and cue competition (Riccio et al., 1984Riccio D.C. Richardson R. Ebner D.L. Memory retrieval deficits based upon altered contextual cues: a paradox.Psychol. Bull. 1984; 96: 152-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The success of memory retrieval can influence the balance between avoidance of threatening situations and exploitation of the environment, both necessary processes for the survival of an animal (Passano, 1957Passano M.L. Prey-predator recognition in the lower vertebrates. University of Oregon Press, Eugene1957Google Scholar). Under natural circumstances, when cue availability is limited, memory retrieval may take advantage of a mnemonic process called pattern completion, the ability to retrieve an entire memory from a partial or degraded sensory cue (Marr, 1971Marr D. Simple memory: a theory for archicortex.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1971; 262: 23-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). Furthermore, situations may arise in which multiple conflicting cues are present, and their discrimination requires an additional process called pattern separation, in which the overlap between representations is minimized (O’Reilly and McClelland, 1994O’Reilly R.C. McClelland J.L. Hippocampal conjunctive encoding, storage, and recall: avoiding a trade-off.Hippocampus. 1994; 4: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). While stability of synaptic connectivity between specific engram cells is a necessary condition for the retrieval of a specific memory, plasticity of whole-engram-cell excitability could, in principle, optimize the efficacy of retrieval by maximizing separation and completion, resulting in an improvement of accuracy and efficiency of recognition. Excitability is an intrinsic physiological property of neurons that sets the threshold for spike generation and controls signal transmission (Hille, 1992Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes.Second Edition. Sinauer Associates Inc, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Plasticity of the degree of excitability is regulated through changes in membrane conductance that can be induced by Hebbian forms of synaptic activation (Aizenman and Linden, 2000Aizenman C.D.

Nevertheless, it is unknown whether recall cues can drive excitability changes in engram cells and how such changes may influence memory retrieval. Here, we investigated the dynamics of excitability of dentate gyrus (DG) engram cells upon their reactivation by recall cues after contextual fear conditioning. We found that reactivation of DG engram cells by contextual cues resulted in a transient enhancement of excitability, which was specific to engram cells, immediately after recall. This rapid but transient change in the state of the engram cell excitability increased the accuracy and efficiency of context recognition and thereby augmented the efficacy of memory retrieval. We employed our previously established method for labeling the DG component of a contextual fear memory engram with ChR2-EYFP (Liu et al., 2012Liu X. Ramirez S. Pang P.T. Puryear C.B. Govindarajan A. Deisseroth K. Tonegawa S. Optogenetic stimulation of a hippocampal engram activates fear memory recall.Nature. 2012; 484: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). An AAV9-TRE-ChR2-EYFP was injected into the DG of transgenic mice engineered to express tTA under the control of the c-fos promoter (c-fos-tTA) (Reijmers et al., 2007Reijmers L.G. Perkins B.L. Matsuo N. Mayford M. Localization of a stable neural correlate of associative memory.Science. 2007; 317: 1230-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Temporal control over the expression was achieved by administering a doxycycline diet (DOX, 40 mg/Kg) (Figures 1A and S1A–S1C). Mice were taken off of DOX 24 hr prior to contextual fear conditioning (CFC) to tag DG engram cells with ChR2-EYFP. After CFC, mice were returned to the home cage on a DOX diet. On a second day, mice were re-exposed to the conditioned context to elicit memory recall and then sacrificed to examine the physiological properties of engram (ChR2-EYFP+) and non-engram (ChR2-EYFP−) cells by ex vivo patch-clamp recordings. Intrinsic properties were determined in whole-cell configuration in three experimental groups (Figures 1B and 1C): a no recall group (NR), a 5-min-post recall group (5m) and a 3-hr-post recall group (3h) (Figures 1D–1F). The resting membrane potential and action potential threshold were unaltered across engram and non-engram cells of all groups (Figure S2A). Membrane resistance and rheobase displayed similar values between engram and non-engram cells for the NR and 3h groups. However, we detected a significant increase in membrane resistance and a reduction in the rheobase in engram cells from the 5m group (Figure 1E). These results revealed an enhanced neuronal excitability due to membrane changes in response to engram cell reactivation induced by re-exposure to the conditioned context (Figures S1D–S1G). Analysis of the current to spike frequency discharge confirmed the result (Figure S2B). Spike rate accommodation (Figure S2B), action potential after hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude and duration (Figure S2C), and post-burst AHP (Figure S2D) were unaltered across engram and non-engram cells of all groups. Membrane excitability wasn’t correlated to the intercellular distance between engram and non-engram cells (Figure S2E). This engram-cell-specific increase in membrane excitability was still detected at 10 min, 30 min, and 1 hr after recall and decayed to baseline in 2 hr (Figure 1G). Importantly, these changes were still triggered by recall of a purely contextual memory formed in the absence of associative conditioning (Figures S3A–S3E). When a novel context (context C) was substituted for the conditioned context (context A) at the recall step, membrane properties of engram cells were not altered, demonstrating the context specificity of the transient increase in engram cell excitability (Figures S3F and S3G). Direct optogenetic activation of engram cells in a novel context did not alter engram cell membrane properties as measured 5 min post-stimulation (Figures S3H and S3I). The recall-induced increase in membrane excitability of engram cells was abolished by injection of an NMDA receptor antagonist before recall (Figure 1H), and its decay was prevented by injection of a protein synthesis inhibitor immediately after recall (Figure 1I), suggesting the importance of avoiding a prolonged hyper-excitation of engram cells. Membrane excitability can be regulated by changes in intrinsic conductances, and most commonly, inward-rectifier potassium channels (Kir2 family) can influence the membrane resistance of DG granule cells (Young et al., 2009Young C.C. Stegen M. Bernard R. Müller M. Bischofberger J. Veh R.W. Haas C.A. Wolfart J. Upregulation of inward rectifier K+ (Kir2) channels in dentate gyrus granule cells in temporal lobe epilepsy.J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 4213-4233Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). DG granule cells displayed a strong inward rectification (Figures 2A and 2B ). We performed a voltage-clamp recording of DG granule cells, holding the membrane potential at −70 mV and recording the current evoked by a negative step voltage (−30 mV). Bath application of a Kir2.1 blocker (ML133, 50 μM) suppressed 68% of the total current (Figure 2C). Pharmacological profiling that targeted the contribution of each leaky potassium conductance confirmed the specificity of the result (Figure S4A). The Kir2.1 current was significantly correlated with the membrane resistance, suggesting a direct control of this specific ion channel over the membrane excitability (Figure 2D). Importantly, 5 min after recall we found a reduction of the engram cell leaky current relative to that of non-engram cells. This reduction was dependent on the decrease of Kir2.1 current and not on a change of residual non-Kir2.1 current (Figures 2E–2H). The dominant contribution of Kir2.1 channels in regulating DG cell excitability and the effect of protein-synthesis inhibitor in abolishing the return to baseline excitability level suggested a mechanism for an engram cell high-excitability state based on a downregulation of Kir2.1 channels. To test this hypothesis, we injected an AAV9-TRE-ChR2-EYFP into the DG of c-fos-tTA mice, subjected them to CFC while off DOX, and re-exposed them to the conditioned context to elicit memory recall. Mice were grouped according to previous criteria (NR, 5m, 3h) with the addition of an anisomycin group (ANI 150 mg/Kg). We performed a Kir2.1 immunostaining and compared Kir2.1 expression in pairs of adjacent engram and non-engram cells. Confocal analysis revealed a downregulation of this channel exclusively in engram cells of the 5m and ANI groups, but not of the NR or 3h groups relative to non-engram cells (Figures 2I–2L, Figures S4B and S4C), providing a molecular mechanism for the recall-induced transient increase of engram cell excitability. We then investigated a potential role of the recall-induced transient increase of engram cell excitability in recall-associated behaviors. We first examined context discrimination by training mice in a CFC paradigm in context A. We assessed freezing in a similar context, AB, in which the prominent visual cues of context A were retained but other cues including odor, lighting, floor material, cage shape, and experimental room were derived from a distinct context B (Figure 3A). On day 2, mice were either directly exposed to context AB (no recall, NR), or were exposed to context AB 5 min (5m) or 3 hr (3h) after the exposure to context A. In context A, the 5m and 3h groups froze at similar levels (Figure 3B). In context AB, the NR and the 3h group showed robust and similar levels of freezing; however, the 5m group displayed negligible freezing (Figure 3B), a result also confirmed in a 1 hr group (Figures S5A and S5B). On day 3, all three groups showed robust and similar levels of freezing to context AB. On day 4, all groups showed similar freezing levels in context A, and the slightly lower levels of freezing displayed by the 5m and 3h groups can be attributed to fear extinction (Quirk and Mueller, 2008Quirk G.J. Mueller D. Neural mechanisms of extinction learning and retrieval.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2008; 33: 56-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar) due to repeated exposures to context A. Thus, we have shown that a transient increase of the engram cell excitability caused by a re-exposure to the conditioned context correlates with an increase in the animal’s ability to discriminate between the conditioned context and its degraded variant (pattern separation). The recall-induced decrease in freezing in the 5m group only occurred in degraded context AB, not in the intact context A (Figures S6A and S6B). Exposure to a novel context C did not attenuate freezing to context AB 5 min later (Figures S6C and S6D), demonstrating the context specificity of this effect and ruling out any non-mnemonic explanation such as arousal. We then investigated the effect of the prior exposure to the conditioned context on the strength of subsequent pattern-completion-based recall. For this purpose, we modified the pre-exposure-dependent CFC paradigm (Fanselow, 1986Fanselow M.S. Associative vs topographical accounts of the immediate shock-freezing deficit in rats: Implications for the response selection rules governing species-specific defensive reactions.Learn. Motiv. 1986; 17: 16-39Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar, Fanselow, 1990Fanselow M.S. Factors governing one-trial contextual conditioning. Animal Learning &amp.Behaviour. 1990; 18: 264-270Google Scholar). On Day 1, we exposed all mice to context A for 10 min without shock to allow the formation of a saturated level of contextual memory (Figure 3C). On Day 2, mice were subjected to either no recall (NR group) or recall (5m and 3h groups) of context A memory with a 3-min-long re-exposure to context A. Then, half of each group was subjected to a 5 s and the other half to a 10 s “immediate shock” procedure (Fanselow, 1990Fanselow M.S. Factors governing one-trial contextual conditioning.

On day 3, all groups of mice subjected to 10 s PSI immediate shock conditioning displayed a general increase in freezing compared to the groups subjected to 5 s PSI conditioning (Figure 3D), revealing an enhanced pattern completion. However, the 5m group displayed significantly more freezing than NR and 3h groups, which displayed similar levels of freezing (Figures 3D and 3E). This result was also confirmed in a 1 hr group (Figures S5C and S5D). These data suggest that the transient increase of excitability of context A memory engram cells correlates with a greater pattern completion capability of conditioned stimuli. To test whether the high-excitability state of engram cells is causally linked with the enhanced context recognition capabilities, we expressed exogenous Kir2.1 ion channels in DG engram cells formed during CFC in context A using an AAV9-TRE-Kir2.1-RFP virus (Figure 4A). When tested 5 min after recall in context A, Kir2.1-RFP+ engram cells showed reduced input resistance and increased rheobase relative to Kir2.1-RFP− non-engram cells. This demonstrated the effect of the exogenous Kir2.1 channel expression in preventing the excitability increase of DG engram cells by recall (Figures 4B and 4C). The expression of Kir2.1 in DG engram cells during CFC had no effect on encoding, memory consolidation, reconsolidation, maintenance, or further learning (Figures S7A–S7C). However, Kir2.1 expression in DG engram cells specifically abolished the recall-induced enhancement of pattern separation as well as the augmented pattern completion (Figures 4D and 4E). This effect was context-specific, since exogenous expression of Kir2.1 channels in engram cells specific to a different context C did not abolish the recall-induced enhancement of pattern separation as well as the augmented pattern completion related to context A (Figures S7D and S7E). In this study, we investigated the memory retrieval process using contextual fear conditioning as a model of episodic-like memory. We identified a previously unknown engram cell state defined by heightened intrinsic excitability and induced rapidly and specifically in engram cells by re-exposure to conditioned stimuli. This rapid increase in DG engram cell excitability is mediated by an internalization of Kir2.1 inward-rectifier potassium channels. The high-excitability state is transient and reverts to the baseline state within 2 hr through a process that requires protein synthesis. This process ensures the reset of engram cell excitability to a steady state. We found that this transient window of high engram cell excitability was causally linked with a short-term increase of the animal’s recognition accuracy for relevant contextual configurations, discriminating them from similar but irrelevant ones. Furthermore the same transient high-excitability state causally enhanced the strength of cue recognition, which manifested as a greater capacity for pattern-completion-mediated recall. Our study revealed that recall of an episodic memory consists of two consecutive functional states of engram cells. In the first state, which corresponds to the quiescent period, the excitability of the engram cells is at a baseline level, and exposure to conditioned stimuli activates them, causing neural transmission and a consequent behavioral reaction. The reactivation of the engram cells triggers a second state by increasing their cellular excitability for 1 hr (Figure 5A). In the first engram cell state, the baseline excitability level does not allow fully accurate and efficient recognition of the context in the presence of conflicting cues or when cues are partially available (Figure 5B). In contrast, the second state enhances the engram cell response to partial cues, augmenting the capability of context recognition (Figure 5B). Recall cues selectively reactivate engram cells supported by the neuronal connectivity pattern established during learning (Poo et al., 2016Poo M.M. Pignatelli M. Ryan T.J. Tonegawa S. Bonhoeffer T.

Our results suggest that the synaptic activation of NMDA receptors triggers a cascade of events causing the internalization of Kir2.1 channels and resulting in an increase of engram cell excitability. Several leaky conductances can contribute to the regulation of the excitability state, and DG granule cells are influenced by many of these conductances (Aller and Wisden, 2008Aller M.I. Wisden W.

https://openalex.org/W2903803657,"Abasic sites are one of the most common DNA lesions. All known abasic site repair mechanisms operate only when the damage is in double-stranded DNA. Here, we report the discovery of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) binding, ESC-specific (HMCES) as a sensor of abasic sites in single-stranded DNA. HMCES acts at replication forks, binds PCNA and single-stranded DNA, and generates a DNA-protein crosslink to shield abasic sites from error-prone processing. This unusual HMCES DNA-protein crosslink intermediate is resolved by proteasome-mediated degradation. Acting as a suicide enzyme, HMCES prevents translesion DNA synthesis and the action of endonucleases that would otherwise generate mutations and double-strand breaks. HMCES is evolutionarily conserved in all domains of life, and its biochemical properties are shared with its E. coli ortholog. Thus, HMCES is an ancient DNA lesion recognition protein that preserves genome integrity by promoting error-free repair of abasic sites in single-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2950310631,"Computational modeling of brain mechanisms of cognition has largely focused on the cortex, but recent experiments have shown that higher-order nuclei of the thalamus participate in major cognitive functions and are implicated in psychiatric disorders. Here, we show that a pulvino-cortical circuit model, composed of the pulvinar and two cortical areas, captures several physiological and behavioral observations related to the macaque pulvinar. Effective connections between the two cortical areas are gated by the pulvinar, allowing the pulvinar to shift the operation regime of these areas during attentional processing and working memory and resolve conflict in decision making. Furthermore, cortico-pulvinar projections that engage the thalamic reticular nucleus enable the pulvinar to estimate decision confidence. Finally, feedforward and feedback pulvino-cortical pathways participate in frequency-dependent inter-areal interactions that modify the relative hierarchical positions of cortical areas. Overall, our model suggests that the pulvinar provides crucial contextual modulation to cortical computations associated with cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2904243413,"Ebola virus (EBOV) infection often results in fatal illness in humans, yet little is known about how EBOV usurps host pathways during infection. To address this, we used affinity tag-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to generate an EBOV-host protein-protein interaction (PPI) map. We uncovered 194 high-confidence EBOV-human PPIs, including one between the viral transcription regulator VP30 and the host ubiquitin ligase RBBP6. Domain mapping identified a 23 amino acid region within RBBP6 that binds to VP30. A crystal structure of the VP30-RBBP6 peptide complex revealed that RBBP6 mimics the viral nucleoprotein (NP) binding to the same interface of VP30. Knockdown of endogenous RBBP6 stimulated viral transcription and increased EBOV replication, whereas overexpression of either RBBP6 or the peptide strongly inhibited both. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of biologics that target this interface and identify additional PPIs that may be leveraged for novel therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2904926540,"Uncontrollable itch-scratching cycles lead to serious skin damage in patients with chronic itch. However, the neural mechanism promoting the itch-scratching cycle remains elusive. Here, we report that tachykinin 1 (Tac1)-expressing glutamatergic neurons in the lateral and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (l/vlPAG) facilitate the itch-scratching cycle. We found that l/vlPAG neurons exhibited scratching-behavior-related neural activity and that itch-evoked scratching behavior was impaired after suppressing the activity of l/vlPAG neurons. Furthermore, we showed that the activity of Tac1-expressing glutamatergic neurons in the l/vlPAG was elevated during itch-induced scratching behavior and that ablating or suppressing the activity of these neurons decreased itch-induced scratching behavior. Importantly, activation of Tac1-expressing neurons induced robust spontaneous scratching and grooming behaviors. The scratching behavior evoked by Tac1-expressing neuron activation was suppressed by ablation of spinal neurons expressing gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), the key relay neurons for itch. These results suggest that Tac1-expressing neurons in the l/vlPAG promote itch-scratching cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2904991918,"In early mammalian embryos, it remains unclear how the first cell fate bias is initially triggered and amplified toward cell fate segregation. Here, we report that a long noncoding RNA, LincGET, is transiently and asymmetrically expressed in the nucleus of two- to four-cell mouse embryos. Overexpression of LincGET in one of the two-cell blastomeres biases its progeny predominantly toward the inner cell mass (ICM) fate. Mechanistically, LincGET physically binds to CARM1 and promotes the nuclear localization of CARM1, which can further increase the level of H3 methylation at Arginine 26 (H3R26me), activate ICM-specific gene expression, upregulate transposons, and increase global chromatin accessibility. Simultaneous overexpression of LincGET and depletion of Carm1 no longer biased embryonic fate, indicating that the effect of LincGET in directing ICM lineage depends on CARM1. Thus, our data identify LincGET as one of the earliest known lineage regulators to bias cell fate in mammalian 2-cell embryos."

This developmental arrest occurs at an earlier stage than following CARM1 depletion, indicating that paraspeckles act upstream of CARM1 but also have additional earlier roles in fate choice. Nuclear organization during pre-implantation development of the mouse embryo displays features necessary for the reprogramming of chromatin (Morgan et al., 2005Morgan H.D. Santos F. Green K. Dean W. Reik W. Epigenetic reprogramming in mammals.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R47-R58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). These involve histone modifications, nuclear repositioning, and the reorganization of chromatin associated with activation of specific genes. These changes occur in the embryo after fertilization and are necessary for establishment of the three lineages of the blastocyst: the pluripotent epiblast (EPI), which gives rise to the future body of the animal and that, together with extra-embryonic primitive endoderm (PE), is derived from the inner cell mass (ICM), and the trophectoderm (TE), the other extra-embryonic tissue that forms the placenta. It has been shown that differences in epigenetic modification between early blastomeres are linked to their fate. Therefore, cells with increased histone H3 arginine 26 methylation (H3R26me2), considered an activating mark, show higher expression of a subset of pluripotency genes that include Nanog and Sox2 and are destined to contribute to embryonic rather than extra-embryonic tissues (Torres-Padilla et al., 2007Torres-Padilla M.E.

However, nuclear organization and its potential effect on gene expression and, specifically, lineage allocation during pre-implantation development have not been addressed extensively and await further investigation. The nuclei of higher eukaryotes contain multiple nuclear bodies that mediate distinct molecular processes, ranging from DNA replication to RNA transcription and processing.

It has been demonstrated that CARM1 interacts with paraspeckles through p54nrb (Hu et al., 2015Hu S.B. Xiang J.F. Li X. Xu Y. Xue W. Huang M. Wong C.C. Sagum C.A. Bedford M.T. Yang L. et al.Protein arginine methyltransferase CARM1 attenuates the paraspeckle-mediated nuclear retention of mRNAs containing IRAlus.Genes Dev. 2015; 29: 630-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although it is known that CARM1 is associated with transcriptional activation and that its differential activity between blastomeres has an effect on lineage allocation, its exact mechanism of action needs further investigation. Here we wished to test the hypothesis that nuclear organization of blastomeres has an effect on proper lineage allocation and pre-implantation development and that this process involves CARM1. Histone H3R26 methylation mediated by CARM1 has been reported to be heterogeneously distributed between blastomeres of 4-cell stage mouse embryos (Torres-Padilla et al., 2007Torres-Padilla M.E. Parfitt D.E. Kouzarides T. Zernicka-Goetz M. Histone arginine methylation regulates pluripotency in the early mouse embryo.Nature. 2007; 445: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), but the nuclear distribution of CARM1 remained unknown. To study CARM1’s nuclear distribution, we first selected an antibody with high specificity against CARM1 in immunofluorescence and western blots (Figures S1A–S1E). Using this specific anti-CARM1 antibody, we identified numerous bright foci of CARM1 staining appearing in the nucleoplasm of 2- and 4-cell stage embryos that became weaker and diffuse in the nucleoplasm by the late 8-cell stage (Figure 1B). Because CARM1 speckles showed a marked increase in number (Figure 1C), intensity (Figure 1D), and size (Figure 1E), specifically in the 2- and 4-cell stage embryo, we focused on analyzing their distribution at these stages. We found that, at the 2-cell stage, the number of CARM1 speckles differed between sister blastomeres, with one cell having an average of 16 such speckles (17.25 ± 1.244, n = 12) and the other 28 (28.00 ± 2.198, n = 12). This difference did not correlate with any changes in histone H3R26me2 staining between blastomeres at this stage (Figures 1F and 1G). Similarly, the number of CARM1 speckles differed between cells in the 4-cell embryo, with one blastomere having a significantly lower number of CARM1 speckles (26 on average; 26.30 ± 1.55, n = 16) in comparison with others (40 on average; 40.30 ± 1.713, n = 16) (Figures 1H and 1I). This difference directly correlated with differential levels of H3R26me2 and was maximal in blastomeres with the highest level of H3R26me2 (Figure 1I; Figures S1F and S1G), shown previously to bias blastomeres to an embryonic rather than extra-embryonic fate. These results indicate that heterogeneity of the numbers of CARM1 speckles and the extent of the histone H3R26me2 modification correlate at the 4-cell stage. Our above observations suggested that the pattern of CARM1 staining resembles “nuclear speckles” or IGCs (Mintz et al., 1999Mintz P.J. Patterson S.D. Neuwald A.F. Spahr C.S. Spector D.L. Purification and biochemical characterization of interchromatin granule clusters.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4308-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Among the IGCs are paraspeckles that characteristically contain a core component, p54nrb, that is also a substrate for CARM1 (Hu et al., 2015Hu S.B. Xiang J.F. Li X. Xu Y. Xue W. Huang M. Wong C.C. Sagum C.A. Bedford M.T. Yang L. et al.Protein arginine methyltransferase CARM1 attenuates the paraspeckle-mediated nuclear retention of mRNAs containing IRAlus.Genes Dev. 2015; 29: 630-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To assess whether CARM1 colocalizes with paraspeckles in the mouse embryo, we next co-stained embryos to reveal CARM1 and two core paraspeckle components, p54nrb and PSPC1. We found an extensive overlap of the staining pattern of CARM1 with either p54nrb or PSPC1 at the 2- and 4-cell stages (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A), suggesting that the majority of CARM1 was associated with paraspeckles. However, a significant proportion of CARM1 was also present in other nuclear speckles. Specifically, 65% ± 7.5% of CARM1 speckles (mean ± SD) co-stained for p54nrb, and 75% ± 9.7% of CARM1 speckles (mean ± SD) were PSPC1-positive (Figure 2C). The presence of CARM1 in the close vicinity of paraspeckle components at the 4-cell stage was also suggested by proximity ligation assays (Figure S2B) and by its immuno-localization at the site of Neat1 RNA detected by in situ hybridization (Figure S2C). Although approximately one-third of CARM1 was present in bodies not associated with paraspeckle markers, 97% ± 1% of p54nrb and 96% ± 2% of PSPC1 speckles co-stained for CARM1 (Figure 2D). These results indicate that, effectively, all paraspeckle structures in the 4-cell stage mouse embryo contain CARM1 and that these represent about two-thirds of the CARM1 speckles (Figure 2E). They also indicate that CARM1 speckles may represent distinct subpopulations of nuclear bodies in the embryo, with the major proportion associated with paraspeckles.Figure S2CARM1 Colocalizes with Paraspeckle Components, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Segmentation of a single nucleus from the 4-cell stage embryo.

Because our results revealed that the majority of CARM1 is associated with paraspeckles, we next wished to determine the consequences of disrupting paraspeckle function by depleting their essential components in the early embryo. We first depleted p54nrb in the zygote by injecting small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting p54nrb, together with synthetic mRNA for membrane-bound Gap43-GFP to mark the injected cells and examined the distribution of CARM1-labeled speckles at the 4-cell stage (Figure 3A). The efficiency of p54nrb knockdown was confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 3B). We found that both the number of CARM1 speckles and CARM1 intensity were reduced upon depletion of p54nrb (Figures 3C–3E). Detailed analysis showed that, in p54nrb-depleted embryos, CARM1-positive structures were reduced by 2.7-fold and the average intensity of CARM1 by 4.0-fold (Figures 3D and 3E). This observation was confirmed when p54nrb was depleted in a single blastomere of the 2-cell stage embryo (Figures S3A and S3B). These results are in accord with the finding that depletion of p54nrb from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) also resulted in loss of both p54nrb and CARM1 (Figures S3C–S3E). A residual pool of CARM1 containing nuclear structures, not affected by 54nrb depletion, could possibly represent the 35% of CARM1 structures not associated with paraspeckles.Figure S3CARM1 Levels Depend on p54nrb and Neat1, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Scheme of p54nrb knockdown experiment.

The above findings raised the question of whether p54nrb might act in partnership with CARM1 to regulate CARM1 expression and/or activity. Because one function of CARM1 is to methylate histone H3 at R26, we asked whether depletion of p54nrb from the zygote stage onward would also reduce H3R26me2 levels. Indeed, we found that downregulation of p54nrb led to a reduction of CARM1 speckles and a reduction in H3R26me2 at distinct nuclear sites (Figures 3F and 3G). This observation was confirmed when p54nrb was downregulated in one of the 2-cell stage blastomeres, allowing us to compare CARM1 speckles and H3R26me2 in the treated and control halves of the embryo (Figures S3A and S3F). Thus, the association of CARM1 with paraspeckles reflects its ability to methylate H3R26 in the 4-cell stage embryo. Paraspeckle integrity also requires ongoing transcription of Neat1, suggesting that paraspeckles are linked to Neat1 biogenesis (Naganuma et al., 2012Naganuma T. Nakagawa S. Tanigawa A. Sasaki Y.F. Goshima N. Hirose T. Alternative 3′-end processing of long noncoding RNA initiates construction of nuclear paraspeckles.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 4020-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, Sasaki and Hirose, 2009Sasaki Y.T.

MENepsilon/beta noncoding RNAs are essential for structural integrity of nuclear paraspeckles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 2525-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We argued, therefore, that if we were to deplete Neat1, then this might have a similar outcome as depleting p54nrb. To address this possibility, we injected zygotes with anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against Neat1 and examined the structure of paraspeckles by analyzing their components, p54nrb and CARM1, at the 4-cell stage (Figure 3H). The efficiency of Neat1 knockdown was confirmed with RT-PCR (Figure 3I). We observed that, in the majority of nuclei (97% ± 1.2%, mean ± SD), paraspeckles were disrupted, as judged by the re-localization of p54nrb from paraspeckles to the periphery of the nucleoli (Figures 3J and 3K). Both the number and the average intensity of CARM1 speckles were reduced by 2.0-fold (Figures 3L and 3M). To verify this result, we injected a single blastomere of 2-cell stage embryos with Neat1 ASOs or control ASOs and cultured embryos until the 4-cell stage. We found that Neat1 depletion resulted in re-localization of p54nrb from paraspeckles around the nucleoli and a reduced number of CARM1 speckles compared with control blastomeres (Figures S3A and S3G). Together, these results suggest that the functional ability of CARM1 to modify H3R26me2 requires paraspeckle integrity, itself dependent on Neat1 RNA and p54nrb. CARM1 is enriched at the Neat1 promoter to inhibit Neat1 transcription, and its deficiency promotes the expression of both isoforms of Neat1 (Hu et al., 2015Hu S.B. Xiang J.F. Li X. Xu Y. Xue W. Huang M. Wong C.C. Sagum C.A. Bedford M.T. Yang L. et al.Protein arginine methyltransferase CARM1 attenuates the paraspeckle-mediated nuclear retention of mRNAs containing IRAlus.Genes Dev. 2015; 29: 630-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We therefore anticipated that elevating CARM1 levels might have similar consequences for paraspeckles as depleting Neat1 transcripts. To test this possibility, we overexpressed CARM1 by injecting increasing concentrations of synthetic Carm1 mRNA into the zygote (Figures 4A and S4A). We found that overexpression of CARM1 indeed reduced the levels of Neat1 transcript (Figure 4B) and led to disruption of paraspeckles and re-localization of their components, including p54nrb, around the nucleoli in 58%, 61%, and 87% ± 3% (mean ± SD) of analyzed nuclei (depending on the concentration of the synthetic mRNA injected) at the 4-cell stage, just as with Neat1 depletion (Figures 4C and 4D; Figures S4B and S4C; Figures 3J and 3K). CARM1 overexpression did not change the expression level of p54nrb, as judged by its average staining intensity, but only its localization (Figures 4C and 4E; Figures S4C and S4D). This observation was confirmed when CARM1 was overexpressed in half of the embryo (Figures S4E and S4F).Figure S4CARM1 Levels Modulate Paraspeckle Body, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Scheme for overexpression of wild-type (WT) Carm1 synthetic mRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2904288379,"Background Depression and anxiety symptoms are prevalent among university students in both developed and developing settings. Recently, grit, defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, has emerged as an indicator of success and well-being. However, the relationship between grit and poor mental health outcomes among university students is largely unknown. The current study investigates the relationship of grit with depression and anxiety among university students in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted from January to March 2018 among university students aged 18–24 years from Chiang Mai University, the first largest university in Chiang Mai Province. Depression and anxiety were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scales, respectively. Grit was measured using the 8-item Short Grit Scale (GRIT-S). Grit scores were grouped into three categories: low (below the 25th percentile); average (from the 25th to the 75th percentiles); and high (above the 75th percentile). The other covariates included variables such self-esteem and socio-demographic variables. Results Of the 800 participants included in the study, 405 (50.6%) were female and 395 (49.4%) were male. Respectively 21.4% and 7.8% of the participants had depression and clinical symptoms of GAD. Increasing levels of grit negatively correlated with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores. Participants with high level of grit scored respectively 1.69 points (P <0.001) and 1.71 points (P < 0.001) lower on the PHQ-9 scale and GAD-7 scores. Similarly, self-esteem was negatively associated with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores. Conclusion Our findings highlight the negative correlation of grit with poor mental health outcomes, particularly depression and anxiety. Interventions designed to improve grit could play an essential role in the prevention of adverse mental health outcomes among university students."

Although pup-directed attacks by males require vomeronasal function, the specific infant cues that elicit this behavior are unknown. We developed a behavioral paradigm based on reconstituted pup cues and showed that discrete infant morphological features combined with salivary chemosignals elicit robust male aggression. Seven vomeronasal receptors were identified based on infant-mediated activity, and the involvement of two receptors, Vmn2r65 and Vmn2r88, in infant-directed aggression was demonstrated by genetic deletion. Using the activation of these receptors as readouts for biochemical fractionation, we isolated two pheromonal compounds, the submandibular gland protein C and hemoglobins. Unexpectedly, none of the identified vomeronasal receptors and associated cues were specific to pups. Thus, infant-mediated aggression by virgin males relies on the recognition of pup's physical traits in addition to parental and infant chemical cues."

Our results demonstrate that tightly regulated axon-glia adhesion is essential for proper myelin targeting and subsequent membrane wrapping and lateral extension. Myelination in the central nervous system (CNS) involves a complex set of intercellular contacts between oligodendrocytes (OLs) and their underlying axons. These interactions are believed to regulate distinct stages of myelinogenesis, including target selection, membrane ensheathment, longitudinal extension of the myelin unit, and functional organization of the axonal membrane (Osso and Chan, 2017Osso L.A.

During development, OLs send multiple exploratory cellular processes that contact numerous axons. Some of these processes are stabilized and develop into myelin internodes while the rest eventually retract (Czopka et al., 2013Czopka T. Ffrench-Constant C. Lyons D.A.

This process may share some similarities with synaptogenesis, where cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) mediate initial target recognition as well as a second step of stabilization (Almeida and Lyons, 2014Almeida R.G.

To examine the role of axoglial CAMs in myelination, we tested whether enhanced adhesion between OLs and neurons could affect myelination and in what manner. We chose to express the extracellular domain of cell adhesion molecule 4 (Cadm4) on the OL cell surface as this CAM is enriched in myelinating OLs (Marques et al., 2016Marques S. Zeisel A.

Cadm4 is a member of a small group of CAMs (Cadm1–Cadm4), also known as synaptic cell adhesion molecules (SynCAM) or Nectin-like adhesion molecules (Necl), which are characterized by the presence of three immunoglobulin-like domains in their extracellular region (Takai et al., 2008Takai Y.

Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Cadm4 mediates internodal axoglial adhesion by binding to axonal Cadm2 and Cadm3 in both the peripheral (Maurel et al., 2007Maurel P. Einheber S. Galinska J. Thaker P. Lam I. Rubin M.B. Scherer S.S.

However, in line with the presence of multiple members of this family in both neurons and myelinating glia and their combinatorial heterophilic binding properties, as well as their redundant function in other systems (Fowler et al., 2017Fowler D.K.

By using a different experimental approach that relies on the expression of the extracellular domain of Cadm4 in OLs, we reveal a critical role for cell adhesion in myelin targeting, membrane wrapping, and lateral extension of the myelin sheath. To assess the contribution of Cadm-mediated axon-oligodendrocyte adhesion in myelination, we infected rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) co-cultured with sensory neurons with a retroviral vector that directs the expression of only the extracellular and transmembrane domains of Cadm4 (Cadm4dCT) in a tetracycline-inducible manner (STAR Methods). The construct also included a short myc tag that enabled the detection of Cadm4dCT-expressing OLs. We reasoned that while such a protein would still be able to mediate cell-cell adhesion, it would be devoid of intracellular signaling capabilities. Induction of Cadm4dCT expression by doxycycline resulted in a pronounced morphological abnormality of myelinating OLs (Figures 1A and 1B). Immunolabeling for Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) revealed that in contrast to the untreated cells, which produced a limited number (9 ± 4) of long myelin internodes (average segment length of 48 ± 26 μm), Cadm4dCT-expressing OLs formed many (100 ± 30) short segments (average segment length of 9 ± 14 μm) (Figures 1C and 1D). Intriguingly, these short oligodendroglial segments were predominantly aligned with axons (Figure S2A), indicating that Cadm4dCT OLs may form excessive axon-glia contact. To further examine the role of Cadm4-mediated adhesion in vivo, we have analyzed transgenic mice in which Cadm4dCT was placed under the MBP promoter (Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT); Golan et al., 2013Golan N. Kartvelishvily E. Spiegel I. Salomon D. Sabanay H. Rechav K. Vainshtein A. Frechter S. Maik-Rachline G. Eshed-Eisenbach Y. et al.Genetic deletion of Cadm4 results in myelin abnormalities resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10950-10961Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These mice expressed the Cadm4dCT transgene in OLs throughout the white matter (Figure S2B). The expression of Cadm4dCT also caused a slight reduction if the expression of the endogenous Cadm4 (data not shown). Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining of sagittal brain sections showed that, compared to wild-type mice, Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) exhibited pronounced hypomyelination in different brain regions, including the corpus callosum, cerebellar white matter, and spinal cord (Figures 1E–1G). In the cerebellum, hypomyelination was already detected at postnatal day 12 (P12) and was clearly observed at P21 and P90 (Figure S2E). As detected by immunolabeling of cerebellar and cortical sections with antibodies to MBP and PLP, Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) myelin appeared short (WT, 18 ± 12 μm and Cadm4dCT, 6 ± 6 μm) and patchy (Figures 1H–1J), resembling myelinating OLs expressing Cadm4dCT in culture (Figure 1A). In accordance with the aberrant myelination elicited by Cadm4dCT in the cortex, we noted a reduction in the number of Caspr-labeled paranodal junctions (Cadm4dCT 60 ± 18 versus 198 ± 40 in wild-type) (Figures 1K and 1L). Immunolabeling of cerebellar sections using the CC1 antibody demonstrated a comparable number of myelinating OLs in Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) (94 ± 25) and wild-type mice (80 ± 23) (Figures S2C and S2D), indicating that Cadm4dCT did not affect the number of OLs. Similar results were observed in the optic nerve (WT, 84 ± 15 versus 95 ± 22 in Cadm4dCT) (Figures S3D and S3E). Transmission electron microscopy (EM) analysis of the corpus callosum of 3-month-old Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) mice showed a mixed hypo- and hypermyelination phenotype (Figures 2A and 2B ). Compared to wild-type tissue, only one-third of the axons were myelinated (Figure 2C), and many axons were surrounded by abnormally thick myelin (g ratio < 0.65) (Figures 2B and 2D–2F). In addition, Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) corpus callosum and spinal cord displayed a range of myelin abnormalities, including extended myelin outfolds, myelin splitting, and vacuolization (Figures 2G–2M). Vacuolization and myelin loss was more pronounced in the spinal cord and the cerebellum (Figure S2E; data not shown) than in the corpus callosum, possibly resulting from the difference in axonal diameter in these tissues. More than 50% of the myelin profiles in the spinal cord and corpus callosum of Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) were abnormal (Figure 2I). Longitudinal sections of Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) optic nerve showed no apparent hypomyelination but the presence of a remarkably short (10.5 μm) internode (Figure S3A). As expected, the reduction in internodal length in the optic nerve was also reflected by an increase in the number of βIV spectrin-labeled nodes of Ranvier in the mutant (3,200 ± 270 in wild-type versus 3,803 ± 560 in Cadm4dCT), but not in the number of CC1-labeled OLs (Figures S3B–S3E). The increase in nodal density in the optic nerve was in contrast to the observed reduction in the number of paranodes in the cortex (Figure 1L). This observation reflects the inherent difference between white and gray matter myelination and the fact that the former exhibits larger density of OLs and available axons, which allow the formation of a higher number of axoglial contact sites in the transgene. Notably, in peripheral nerves, we also found an increase in nodal density (Figures S3F and S3G; mean of 58 ± 12 in wild-type versus 144 ± 27 in Cadm4dCT), and a marked decrease in internodal length (Figure S3H; e.g., 1,104 μm in wild-type versus 202 ± 28 μm in Cadm4dCT in the presented example). To further examine the phenotype of OLs expressing Cadm4dCT, we co-cultured OPCs isolated from wild-type and Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) brains with sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and traced the cellular processes of individual cells. We found that while each wild-type oligodendrocyte formed a restricted number (average of 24 ± 17 per cell) of MBP-labeled myelin segments, OLs expressing Cadm4dCT formed many more (average of 152 ± 55 per cell) MBP-positive segments around axons (Figures 3A–3E). Cadm4dCT myelin segments were shorter than the ones formed by wild-type cells (average of 6 ± 6 μm Cadm4dCT versus 30 ± 25 μm wild-type), with less than 20% of the segments being longer than 10 μm compared to >80% in the wild-type (Figure 3E). These segments were often formed by a thin cellular process that originated from a proximal short myelin segment that failed to elongate (Figure 3C). As expected, the increased number of short myelin segments resulted in an increased number of Caspr clusters that were associated with individual OLs (Figures 3F and 3G). Recent studies suggest that the balance between positive and negative signals regulate myelin targeting (Almeida et al., 2018Almeida R.G. Pan S. Cole K.L.H. Williamson J.M. Early J.J. Czopka T.

To determine whether the excessive oligodendrocyte adhesion conferred by Cadm4dCT could change myelin targeting, we examined whether Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) OLs myelinate non-axonal structures. We concentrated our attention on neuronal cell bodies since they are not usually myelinated but express the neuronal receptors for Cadm4 as inferred by binding of the extracellular domain of Cadm4 (Figure S4C). As depicted in Figure 3H, we observed neuronal cell body ensheathment in myelinating spinal cord culture prepared from a double transgenic mouse expressing both Cadm4dCT and MAG-GFP (Erb et al., 2006Erb M. Flueck B. Kern F. Erne B. Steck A.J. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Unraveling the differential expression of the two isoforms of myelin-associated glycoprotein in a mouse expressing GFP-tagged S-MAG specifically regulated and targeted into the different myelin compartments.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 31: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Given that early differentiating OLs make transient contact with neuronal cell bodies (Almeida et al., 2018Almeida R.G. Pan S. Cole K.L.H. Williamson J.M. Early J.J. Czopka T. Klingseisen A. Chan J.R. Lyons D.A. Myelination of neuronal cell bodies when myelin supply exceeds axonal demand.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: 1296-1305.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; Figures S3J and S3K), we searched for cell body myelination in adult (P90) mouse brains by labeling for MBP. We detected extensive ensheathment of neuronal cell bodies in the cerebellum of Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT), but not in wild-type, mice (Figures 3I and 3J). Furthermore, in marked contrast to wild-type mice, we noted the ensheathment of neuronal cell bodies in other brain areas such as the olfactory bulb (Figure S3I) and hippocampus (data not shown). In agreement, using TEM, we detected the presence of multiple myelin layers around cell bodies in the cerebellum of Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) mice (Figures 3K–3O). These observations, along with the multiple MBP segments observed in association with Cadm4dCT-expressing OLs, suggest that early OL-neuron interactions are prematurely stabilized in cells expressing Cadm4dCT. Our results indicate that adhesive interactions between oligodendrocyte processes and axons regulate myelin targeting, as well as membrane wrapping and longitudinal extension that are required for the formation of mature myelin internodes. In Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) mice, expression of the extracellular domain of Cadm4 in OLs results in excessive adhesion, leading to both mistargeting (i.e., wrapping of neuronal cell bodies) and myelination failure. We reasoned that if the abnormalities detected in Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) mice are indeed dependent upon neuron-glia adhesion mediated by Cadm4, they would not be detected if these OLs were grown either alone or on nanofibers, which lack specific axonal adhesive molecules but enable membrane ensheathment (Bechler et al., 2015Bechler M.E.

Chan J.R. A culture system to study oligodendrocyte myelination processes using engineered nanofibers.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that when grown in the absence of neurons, the morphology of OLs expressing Cadm4dCT as assessed by MBP immunoreactivity was indistinguishable from wild-type cells (WT 12 ± 6.8 mm2 versus 12 ± 9.8 mm2 in Cadm4dCT) (Figures 4A and 4B ). We next isolated OPCs from wild-type and Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) mice and cultured them for 10 days on either neurons or polystyrene nanofibers before labeling with antibodies to MBP or to opalin, which labels the oligodendrocyte cell soma, processes, and myelinated internodes (Golan et al., 2008Golan N. Adamsky K. Kartvelishvily E. Brockschnieder D. Möbius W. Spiegel I. Roth A.D. Thomson C.E. Rechavi G. Peles E. Identification of Tmem10/Opalin as an oligodendrocyte enriched gene using expression profiling combined with genetic cell ablation.Glia. 2008; 56: 1176-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We found that while Cadm4dCT OLs were clearly distinct from wild-type cells when grown in the presence of neurons, they displayed identical morphology to wild-type OLs when grown on nanofibers (Figure 4C). As an additional approach, we infected rat OPCs with a retroviral vector that enables the induction of Cadm4dCT expression by doxycycline prior to placing the cells on nanofibers (i.e., prior to MBP expression). Similar to the results obtained with Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) isolated cells, we found no difference in the morphology of doxycycline-treated or non-treated OLs (Figure 4D). To further determine whether the phenotype of OLs expressing Cadm4dCT is due to increased neuron-glia adhesion, we isolated OPCs from Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) mice and cultured them with neurons isolated from either wild-type or mice lacking both Cadm2 and Cadm3, which serve as the axonal receptors of Cadm4 (Figures S4A and S4B; Maurel et al., 2007Maurel P.

Peles E. A central role for Necl4 (SynCAM4) in Schwann cell-axon interaction and myelination.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We found that Cadm4dCT OLs grown on Cadm2−/−/Cadm3−/− neurons displayed fewer MBP-labeled processes associated with axons (average of 31 ± 9 per cell) compared to those grown on wild-type neurons (average of 157 ± 41 per cell) (Figures 4E and 4F). This phenotypic attenuation was also accompanied by an increase in process length, with only less than 15% being smaller than 5 μm when Cadm4dCT oligodendrocytes were grown on Cadm2−/−/Cadm3−/− neurons compared to >55% when they were grown on wild-type neurons (Figure 4G). Our results reveal an important role for axoglial CAMs in CNS myelination by regulating target selection, myelin wrapping, and internodal extension. This conclusion is based on the following findings. (1) Expression of the extracellular region of Cadm4 in OLs grown with wild-type neurons in vitro resulted in the formation of excess axonal contacts, which failed to generate myelin internodes. (2) This phenotype could be rescued by removal of the neuronal Cadm4 receptors (i.e., Cadm2 and Cadm3) and was not detected when Cadm4dCT-expressing OLs were cultured either alone or on nanofibers. (3) Transgenic mice expressing Cadm4dCT under the MBP promoter display severe hypomyelination as well as additional myelin abnormalities in both gray and white matter. (4) OLs expressing Cadm4dCT are mistargeted and ensheathe neuronal cell bodies. The inability of Cadm4dCT to form mature elongated internodes in vitro, along with the presence of the unusually short internodes detected in Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) optic nerve, indicates that cell adhesion plays an important role in the lateral extension of the forming myelin segment. Given the coupling of membrane wrapping with internodal extension (Snaidero et al., 2014Snaidero N. Möbius W. Czopka T. Hekking L.H. Mathisen C. Verkleij D. Goebbels S. Edgar J. Merkler D. Lyons D.A. et al.Myelin membrane wrapping of CNS axons by PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent polarized growth at the inner tongue.Cell. 2014; 156: 277-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the lateral extension abnormality may be secondary to a membrane-wrapping defect. During myelination, the leading edge of the myelin sheath grows around the axon while displacing the previously deposited membrane (Snaidero et al., 2014Snaidero N. Möbius W. Czopka T. Hekking L.H. Mathisen C. Verkleij D. Goebbels S. Edgar J. Merkler D.

In addition, Cadm4dCT OLs established numerous short MBP-labeled myelin segments on adjacent axons that were often linked by a single cellular process. These reflect the inability of the mutant OLs to retract the initial contacts made during the early exploratory stage of myelination (Czopka et al., 2013Czopka T. Ffrench-Constant C. Lyons D.A.

In line with this notion, time-lapse microscopy of myelinating spinal cord cultures made from Tg(mag-GFP) and Tg(mag-GFP/mbp-Cadm4dCT) mice showed that while wild-type OLs sent processes that dynamically attached, retracted, and myelinated axons, Cadm4dCT OLs attached axons but remained relatively static (data not shown). Excessive axoglial contact results in the stabilization of early and otherwise transient axoglial interactions as evident by the ensheathment of neuronal somas. In agreement with the observations Almeida et al., 2018Almeida R.G. Pan S. Cole K.L.H. Williamson J.M. Early J.J. Czopka T. Klingseisen A. Chan J.R. Lyons D.A. Myelination of neuronal cell bodies when myelin supply exceeds axonal demand.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: 1296-1305.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar made in vivo in the zebrafish, we found that during early stages of myelination in cultures (3 days in vitro [DIV3]), 27% of O4-positive cell processes attached to neuronal cell bodies, but these processes retracted with further differentiation and myelination and reached only 2.5% at DIV11 (Figures S3J-K). In Cadm4dCT OLs, these early transient contacts persist, leading to ectopic ensheathment and myelination of neuronal cell bodies both in vitro and in vivo. The avoidance of OLs from neuronal cell bodies is controlled by inhibitory signals such as JAM2, an immunoglobulin CAM present at the somatodendritic compartment (Redmond et al., 2016Redmond S.A. Mei F. Eshed-Eisenbach Y. Osso L.A. Leshkowitz D. Shen Y.A. Kay J.N. Aurrand-Lions M. Lyons D.A. Peles E. Chan J.R. Somatodendritic expression of JAM2 inhibits oligodendrocyte myelination.Neuron. 2016; 91: 824-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is also regulated by positive axonal signals, as evident by the recent observation that cell body myelination occurs when the number of OLs exceeds axonal availability (Almeida et al., 2018Almeida R.G. Pan S. Cole K.L.H. Williamson J.M. Early J.J. Czopka T. Klingseisen A. Chan J.R. Lyons D.A. Myelination of neuronal cell bodies when myelin supply exceeds axonal demand.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: 1296-1305.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this case, myelination of non-axonal structures is enabled by the lack of sufficient positive axonal signals. Our results show that myelin targeting is regulated by oligodendrocyte-neuron adhesion and that neuronal cell body myelination could also occur as a result of an increase in adhesion mediated by axoglial CAMs in non-axonal structures. In addition to neuronal cell body myelination, Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) mice exhibit several other myelin abnormalities, including short and aberrant myelin segments, intramyelinic swelling, and myelin outfoldings, all of which demonstrate that regulated axon-glia adhesion is required to form and maintain the intricate myelin unit. Tg(mbp-Cadm4dCT) mice also display a mixed hypo- and hypermyelination phenotype in the corpus callosum. While hypomyelination is in line with the notion that Cadm4dCT expression leads to excessive adhesion and unregulated cell-cell contact, the presence of hypermyelination is less clear and may reflect a requirement for the cytoplasmic domain of Cadm4 in mediating a negative feedback signal from axons undergoing myelination back to the overlying OLs. In support of this idea, expression of the cytoplasmic domain of Cadm4 in Schwann cells inhibits myelination (Spiegel et al., 2007Spiegel I. Adamsky K. Eshed Y. Milo R. Sabanay H. Sarig-Nadir O. Horresh I. Scherer S.S. Rasband M.N. Peles E. A central role for Necl4 (SynCAM4) in Schwann cell-axon interaction and myelination.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus"

Using an hESC-based cardiac differentiation model, we define a class of divergent lncRNAs, termed yin yang lncRNAs (yylncRNAs), that mirror the cell-type-specific expression pattern of their protein-coding counterparts. yylncRNAs are preferentially encoded from the genomic loci of key developmental cell fate regulators. Most yylncRNAs are spliced polyadenylated transcripts showing comparable expression patterns in vivo in mouse and in human embryos. Signifying their developmental function, the key mesoderm specifier BRACHYURY (T) is accompanied by yylncT, which localizes to the active T locus during mesoderm commitment. yylncT binds the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, and its transcript is required for activation of the T locus, with yylncT depletion specifically abolishing mesodermal commitment. Collectively, we report a lncRNA-mediated regulatory layer safeguarding embryonic cell fate transitions."

Here, we characterize conversion of mouse fibroblasts into iPSCs using Gatad2a-Mbd3/NuRD-depleted and highly efficient reprogramming systems. Unbiased high-resolution profiling of dynamic changes in levels of gene expression, chromatin engagement, DNA accessibility, and DNA methylation were obtained. We identified two distinct and synergistic transcriptional modules that dominate successful reprogramming, which are associated with cell identity and biosynthetic genes. The pluripotency module is governed by dynamic alterations in epigenetic modifications to promoters and binding by Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, but not Myc. Early DNA demethylation at certain enhancers prospectively marks cells fated to reprogram. Myc activity drives expression of the essential biosynthetic module and is associated with optimized changes in tRNA codon usage. Our functional validations highlight interweaved epigenetic- and Myc-governed essential reconfigurations that rapidly commission and propel deterministic reprogramming toward naive pluripotency."

A total of 76,247 oil and gas recovery wells were permitted, of which 35,163 (46%) were on land (as of 2010) and 27,483 of which are officially abandoned. There is a direct spatial and temporal relationship between the number of these permits and land loss, attributable to the above and belowground changes in hydrology resulting from the dredged material levees placed parallel to the canal (spoil banks). These hydrologic modifications cause various direct and indirect compromises to plants and soils resulting in wetland collapse. Although oil and gas recovery beneath southern Louisiana wetlands has dramatically declined since its peak in the early 1960s, it has left behind spoil banks with a total length sufficient to cross coastal Louisiana 79 times from east to west. Dragging down the remaining material in the spoil bank back into the canal is a successful restoration technique that is rarely applied in Louisiana, but could be a dramatically cost-effective and proven long-term strategy if political will prevails. The absence of a State or Federal backfilling program is a huge missed opportunity to: 1) conduct cost-effective restoration at a relatively low cost, and, 2) conduct systematic restoration monitoring and hypothesis testing that advances knowledge and improves the efficacy of future attempts. The price of backfilling all canals is about $335 million dollars, or 0.67% of the State's Master Plan for restoration and a pittance of the economic value gained from extracting the oil and gas beneath over the last 100 years."

We examined EGFR T790M and C797S mutations, BRAF V600E mutation, and MET amplification with the MBP-QP method and with droplet digital PCR using ctDNA and re-biopsy samples obtained before and after afatinib treatment. Just before afatinib treatment, 15 of the 20 patients were T790M negative and five were positive. Among the T790M negative patients, 40.0% (6/15) became positive at the time of PD under afatinib. In patients positive for T790M, changes in T790M allele frequency were correlated with afatinib treatment efficacy. C797S was not detected in any patients just before afatinib treatment, but it appeared after treatment in three patients, although with very low allele frequency. Two of these three patients, although positive for both C797S and T790M, achieved PR to osimertinib. However, PFS of these patients was somewhat shorter than that of patients positive for T790M only. BRAF V600E was detected in one patient at PD under afatinib. MET amplification was not detected in this study. T790M is associated with acquired resistance to afatinib, as with 1st generation EGFR-TKI, but with somewhat lower frequency. The influence of C797S on resistance to afatinib is less than that of T790M, but C797S might cause shorter PFS under osimertinib."
https://openalex.org/W2905562204,"Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by transcriptional silencing of the frataxin (FXN) gene, resulting in loss of the essential mitochondrial protein frataxin. Based on the knowledge that a GAA·TTC repeat expansion in the first intron of FXN induces heterochromatin, we previously showed that 2-aminobenzamide–type histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) increase FXN mRNA levels in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived FRDA neurons and in circulating lymphocytes from patients after HDACi oral administration. How the reduced expression of frataxin leads to neurological and other systemic symptoms in FRDA patients remains unclear. Similar to other triplet-repeat disorders, it is unknown why FRDA affects only specific cell types, primarily the large sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia and cardiomyocytes. The combination of iPSC technology and genome-editing techniques offers the unique possibility to address these questions in a relevant cell model of FRDA, obviating confounding effects of variable genetic backgrounds. Here, using scarless gene-editing methods, we created isogenic iPSC lines that differ only in the length of the GAA·TTC repeats. To uncover the gene expression signatures due to the GAA·TTC repeat expansion in FRDA neuronal cells and the effect of HDACi on these changes, we performed RNA-seq–based transcriptomic analysis of iPSC-derived central nervous system (CNS) and isogenic sensory neurons. We found that cellular pathways related to neuronal function, regulation of transcription, extracellular matrix organization, and apoptosis are affected by frataxin loss in neurons of the CNS and peripheral nervous system and that these changes are partially restored by HDACi treatment."

On coral reefs, fish living within the branches of coral colonies can promote coral performance, and it has been hypothesized that the enhanced water flow and nutrients provided by fish to corals could ameliorate coral bleaching. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of small, aggregating damselfish on the health of their host corals (physiology, recovery, and survival) before, during, and after a thermal-bleaching event. When comparing coral colonies with and without fish, those with resident fish exhibited higher Symbiodinium densities and chlorophyll in both field and experimentally-induced bleaching conditions, and higher protein concentrations in field colonies. Additionally, colonies with damselfish in aquaria exhibited both higher photosynthetic efficiency (FV/FM) during bleaching stress and post-bleaching recovery, compared to uninhabited colonies. These results demonstrate that symbiotic damselfishes, and the services they provide, translate into measureable impacts on coral tissue, and can influence coral bleaching susceptibility/resilience and recovery. By mediating how external abiotic stressors influence coral colony health, damselfish can affect the functional responses of these interspecific interactions in a warming ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2904632490,"Basement membrane (BM) is an essential part of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that plays a crucial role in mechanical support and signaling to epithelial cells during lung development, homeostasis and repair. Abnormal composition and remodeling of the lung ECM have been associated with developmental abnormalities observed in multiple pediatric and adult respiratory diseases. Collagen VI (COL6) is a well-studied muscle BM component, but its role in the lung and its effect on pulmonary epithelium is largely undetermined. We report the presence of COLVI immediately subjacent to human airway and alveolar epithelium in the pediatric lung, in a location where it is likely to interact with epithelial cells. In vitro, both primary human lung epithelial cells and human lung epithelial cell lines displayed an increased rate of ""wound healing"" in response to a scratch injury when plated on COL6 as compared to other matrices. For the 16HBE cell line, wounds remained >5-fold larger for cells on COL1 (p<0.001) and >6-fold larger on matrigel (p<0.001), a prototypical basement membrane, when compared to COL6 (>96% closure at 10 hr). The effect of COL6 upon lung epithelial cell phenotype was associated with an increase in cell spreading. Three hours after initial plating, 16HBE cells showed >7-fold less spreading on matrigel (p<0.01), and >4-fold less spreading on COL1 (p<0.01) when compared to COL6. Importantly, the addition of COL6 to other matrices also enhanced cell spreading. Similar responses were observed for primary cells. Inhibitor studies indicated both integrin β1 activity and activation of multiple signaling pathways was required for enhanced spreading on all matrices, with the PI3K/AKT pathway (PI3K, CDC42, RAC1) showing both significant and specific effects for spreading on COL6. Genetic gain-of-function experiments demonstrated enhanced PI3K/AKT pathway activity was sufficient to confer equivalent cell spreading on other matrices as compared to COL6. We conclude that COL6 has significant and specific effects upon human lung epithelial cell-autonomous functions."

Walking training is highly important since the ability to walk is considered to be a meaningful occupation for most people, and is often reduced after a brain injury. This suggests a need to innovate stroke rehabilitation, so that forms of walking training that are user-friendly and enjoyable can be provided. Method An interview study was carried out with persons after stroke (n = 8), or acquired brain injury (n = 2) at a rehabilitation unit at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. We used a semi-structured interview guide to investigate experiences and thoughts about walking on a treadmill with non-immersive virtual reality feedback. The contents were analyzed through an inductive approach, using qualitative content analysis. Results The virtual reality experience was perceived as enjoyable, exciting, and challenging. Participants stressed that the visual and auditory feedback increased their motivation to walk on a treadmill. However, for some participants, the virtual reality experience was too challenging, and extreme tiredness or fatigue were reported after the walking session. Conclusions Participants’ thoughts and experiences indicated that the Virtual Reality walking system could serve as a complement to more traditional forms of walking training. Early after a brain injury, virtual reality could be a way to train the ability to handle individually adapted multisensory input while walking.

However, the role of serum UA level in renal graft survival remains controversial. Objective This study aimed to investigate the effect of mean serum UA level during two different post-KT periods on long-term renal graft outcomes in a large population cohort in which living donor KT prevails. Material and methods A retrospective cohort study was performed using KT data prospectively collected at a single institution. Patients (n = 2,993) were divided into low-, normal-, and high-UA groups according to the mean serum UA level within the first year (1-YR) and 1–5 years (5-YR) after transplantation. Results In the 1-YR Cox proportional hazards analysis, the low- and high-UA groups had a significantly decreased and increased risk, respectively, for overall graft failure (OGF), death-censored graft failure (DCGF), and composite event (return to dialysis, retransplantation, death from graft dysfunction, and 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate) compared with the normal-UA group. Similarly, in the 5-YR analysis, the low-UA group had a significantly reduced risk of DCGF compared with the normal-UA group, whereas the high-UA group had a significantly increased risk of all three graft outcomes. In a marginal structural model, hyperuricemia had a significant causal effect on worsening graft outcomes, with consideration of all confounding variables (OGF: hazard ratio [HR] 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33–3.78; DCGF: HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.09–4.9; composite event: HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.64–5.49). Conclusions A low-to-normal serum UA level within the first year and 1–5 years after KT is an independent factor for better renal allograft outcomes in the long-term follow-up period rather than high serum UA level."
https://openalex.org/W2904504627,"Metastasis to distant organs is a major cause for solid cancer mortality, and the acquisition of migratory and invasive phenotype is a key factor in initiation of malignancy. In this study we investigated the contribution of Mixed-Lineage Kinase 4 (MLK4) to aggressive phenotype of breast cancer cells. Our TCGA cancer genomic data analysis revealed that amplification or mRNA upregulation of MLK4 occurred in 23% of invasive breast carcinoma cases. To find the association between MLK4 expression and the specific subtype of breast cancer, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of multiple datasets, which showed that MLK4 is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer compared to other molecular subtypes. Depletion of MLK4 in cell lines with high MLK4 expression impaired proliferation and anchorage-dependent colony formation. Moreover, silencing of MLK4 expression significantly reduced the migratory potential and invasiveness of breast cancer cells as well as the number of spheroids formed in 3D cultures. These in vitro findings translate into slower rate of tumor growth in mice upon MLK4 knock-down. Furthermore, we established that MLK4 activates NF-κB signaling and promotes a mesenchymal phenotype in breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemical staining of samples obtained from breast cancer patients revealed a strong positive correlation between high expression of MLK4 and metastatic potential of tumors, which was predominantly observed in TNBC subgroup. Taken together, our results show that high expression of MLK4 promotes migratory and invasive phenotype of breast cancer and may represent a novel target for anticancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2903794247,"The development of genetic sexing strains (GSSs) based on classical genetic approaches has revolutionized the application of the sterile insect technique (SIT) against the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae). The global use of Mediterranean fruit fly GSS for SIT applications as part of area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programmes is testimony to their effectiveness. During recent years, transgenic sexing strains (TSSs) have been developed through genetic engineering techniques offering the possibility to produce male-only progeny by introducing female embryonic lethal genes and to increase the efficacy to identify released sterile males by means of the expression of fluorescent transgene markers. Here, we present a comparative analysis of two Mediterranean fruit fly strains: the classical GSS VIENNA 8D53-/Toliman and the transgenic FSEL#32. The strains were compared for production efficiency and quality control indices under semi mass-rearing conditions, response to sterilizing irradiation doses, male mating performance in walk-in field cages, and production cost of male-only pupae. The results showed that, the FSEL #32 TSS had a similar fecundity but a higher production of male-only pupae than the VIENNA 8D53-/Toliman GSS. For some of the quality control parameters tested, such as pupal weight and survival under starvation conditions, the FSEL #32 TSS was inferior to the VIENNA 8D53-/Toliman GSS. Both the transgenic and the classical genetic sexing strains have shown acceptable and similar mating competitiveness when compared with wild males for mating with wild females. The cost production for both strains is similar but the FSEL#32 TSS may potentially be more cost effective at higher production levels. The results are discussed in the context of incorporating the transgenic strain for SIT application."

However, the genetics of the genus Dracaena and the formation mechanism of dragon's blood remain poorly understood. Here, we generate the first draft genome reference assembly of an elite Chinese Dracaena species, Dracaena cambodiana, from next-generation sequencing data with 89.46× coverage. The reads were assembled into 2,640,704 contigs with an N50 length of 1.87 kb, and a 1.05 Gb assembly was finally assembled with 2,379,659 scaffolds. Furthermore, 97.75% of the 267,243 simple sequence repeats identified from these scaffolds were mononucleotide, dinucleotide, and trinucleotide repeats. Among all 53,700 predicted genes, 158 genes involved in cell wall and plant hormone synthesis and reactive oxygen species scavenging showed altered regulation during the formation of dragon's blood. This study provides a genomic characterization of D. cambodiana and improves understanding of the molecular mechanism of dragon's blood formation. This report represents the first genome-wide characterization of a Dracaena species in the Asparagaceae."
https://openalex.org/W2905280724,"Uterine gland development, also known as adenogenesis, is a key uterine morphogenic process indispensable for normal uterine function and fertility. Our earlier studies have reported that overactivation of TGFB receptor 1 (TGFBR1) in the mouse uterus using progesterone receptor (Pgr)-Cre recombinase causes female infertility, defective decidualization, and reduced uterine gland formation, a developmental milestone of postnatal uterus. To understand mechanisms that underpin the disrupted uterine gland formation in mice with sustained activation of TGFBR1, we raised the question of whether early postnatal adenogenesis was compromised in these mice. Experiments were designed using mice with constitutive activation of TGFBR1 driven by Pgr-Cre to determine the timing of adenogenic defects and potential mechanisms associated with dysregulation of adenogenic genes, luminal epithelial cell proliferation and endometrial fibrotic changes. Uterine tissues from mice with constitutive activation of TGFBR1 were collected during the critical time window of adenogenesis and analyzed together with age-matched controls. Multiple approaches including immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Trichrome staining, quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, conditional knockout and human endometrial cell culture were utilized. TGFBR1 activation in the mouse uterus suppressed adenogenesis during postnatal uterine development, concomitant with the aberrant differentiation of uterine stromal cells. Analysis of transcript expression of WNT pathway components revealed dysregulation of adenogenesis-associated genes. Notably, the adenogenic defects occurred in spite of the increased proliferation of uterine luminal epithelial cells, accompanied by increased expression of genes associated with fibrotic changes. Moreover, the adenogenic defects were alleviated in mice where TGFBR1 was activated in presumably half of the complement of uterine cells. Our results suggest that altered differentiation of endometrial stromal cells and formation of stromal compartment promote adenogenic defects."
https://openalex.org/W2905259847,"Background We investigated the role of nutritional risk index (NRI) in predicting 1-year mortality in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Methods Among 5,625 cohort patients enrolled in Korean Acute Heart Failure (KorAHF) Registry, a total of 5,265 patients who were possible to calculate NRI [NRI = (1.519 x serum albumin [g/dl]) + (41.7 x weight [kg]/ideal body weight [kg])] were enrolled. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to the NRI quartile; Q1 <89 (n = 1121, 69.9 ± 14.5 years, 632 males), Q2 89–95 (n = 1234, 69.7 ± 14.4 years, 677 males), Q3 95–100 (n = 1199, 68.8 ± 14.0 years, 849 males), Q4 >100 (n = 1711, 65.6 ± 14.5 years, 779 males). Primary end-point was all-cause mortality at 1-year clinical follow-up. Results The 1-year mortality was significantly increased as the NRI quartile decreased, and the lowest NRI quartile was associated with the highest 1-year mortality (Q1: 27.5% vs. Q2: 20.9% vs. Q3: 12.9% vs. Q4: 8.7%, linear p <0.001). On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the significant inter-quartile difference was observed (p <0.001 for all). In multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard regression, the lowest NRI quartile was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality in patients with ADHF. Conclusions Poor nutritional status as assessed by NRI and quartile grading of NRI was associated with 1-year mortality in Korean patients with ADHF. The assessment of nutritional status by NRI may provide additional prognostic information and thus would be useful in the risk stratification of the patients with ADHF."
https://openalex.org/W2904798581,"Microbubbles (MB) can be compressed to nanometer-sized droplets and reactivated with diagnostic ultrasound; these reactivated MB possess unique imaging characteristics.We hypothesized that droplets formed from compressing Definity MB may be used for infarct-enhancement imaging.Fourteen rats underwent ligation of their left anterior descending (LAD) artery, and five pigs underwent 90 minute balloon occlusions of their mid LAD. At 48 hours in rats, transthoracic ultrasound was performed at two and four minutes following 200 μL intravenous injections (IVI) of Definity droplets (DD), at which point the MI was increased from 0.5 to 1.5 to assess for a transient contrast enhancement zone (TEZ) within akinetic segments. In pigs, 1.0 mL injections of DD were administered and low frame rate (triggered end systolic or 10 Hz) imaging 2-4 minutes post iVI to selectively activate and image the infarct zone (IZ). Infarct size was defined by delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) and post-mortem staining (TTC).Increasing MI to 1.5 (at two or four minutes after IVI) resulted in a TEZ in rats, which correlated with infarct size (r = 0.94, p<0.001). A TEZ was not seen at 2-4 minutes in any rat (n = 8) following Definity MB injections. Fluorescent staining confirmed DD presence within the infarct zone 10 minutes after intravenous injection. In pigs, selective enhancement within the IZ was achieved by using a low frame rate single pulse harmonic mode; IZ size matched the location seen with DE-MRI and correlated with TTC defect size (r = 0.90, p<0.05).DD formulated from commercially available MB can be acoustically activated for selective infarct enhancement imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2904226019,"LIM kinases are located at a strategic crossroad, downstream of several signaling pathways and upstream of effectors such as microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton. Cofilin is the only LIM kinases substrate that is well described to date, and its phosphorylation on serine 3 by LIM kinases controls cofilin actin-severing activity. Consequently, LIM kinases inhibition leads to actin cytoskeleton disorganization and blockade of cell motility, which makes this strategy attractive in anticancer treatments. LIMK has also been reported to be involved in pathways that are deregulated in hematologic malignancies, with little information regarding cofilin phosphorylation status. We have used proteomic approaches to investigate quantitatively and in detail the phosphorylation status of cofilin in myeloid tumor cell lines of murine and human origin. Our results show that under standard conditions, only a small fraction (10 to 30% depending on the cell line) of cofilin is phosphorylated (including serine 3 phosphorylation). In addition, after a pharmacological inhibition of LIM kinases, a residual cofilin phosphorylation is observed on serine 3. Interestingly, this 2D gel based proteomic study identified new phosphorylation sites on cofilin, such as threonine 63, tyrosine 82 and serine 108."

However, our understanding of how H3.3 controls gene expression and epigenome landscape has remained incomplete. This is partly because precise localization of H3.3 in the genome has been difficult to decipher particularly for cells in vivo. To circumvent this difficulty, we generated knockin mice, by homologous recombination, to replace both of the two H3.3 loci (H3f3a and H3f3b) with the hemagglutinin-tagged H3.3 cDNA cassette, which also contained a GFP gene. We show here that the hemagglutinin-tagged H3.3 and GFP are expressed in the majority of cells in all adult tissues tested. ChIP-seq data, combined with RNA-seq, revealed a striking correlation between the level of transcripts and that of H3.3 accumulation in expressed genes. Finally, we demonstrate that H3.3 deposition is markedly enhanced upon stimulation by interferon on interferon-stimulated genes, highlighting transcription-coupled H3.3 dynamics.

Despite the well-acknowledged importance, our understanding of H3.3 has been hampered considerably, because of the difficulties in distinguishing H3.3 from the canonical histone H3. Thus, regulated expression of endogenous H3.3 proteins has remained elusive, including regulated distribution of H3.3 in the genome. Further, it is largely unknown how H3.3 responds to physiological changes in the cells. Exogenous introduction of a tagged H3.3, although useful in some cases, does not substitute for the endogenous H3.3 genes. It is of note that Wen et al. (30Wen D. Noh K.M. Goldberg A.D. Allis C.D.

Genome editing a mouse locus encoding a variant histone, H3.3B, to report on its expression in live animals.Genesis. 2014; 52 (25262655): 959-96610.1002/dvg.22827Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) reported construction of H3f3b-HA 4The abbreviations used are:HAhemagglutininTSStranscription start siteTEStranscription end siteqRT-PCRquantitative RT-PCRIHCimmunohistochemistryMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastIFNinterferonISGIFN-stimulated geneFCfold changeFDRfalse discovery rateEGFPenhanced GFP. mice using a zinc finger genome-editing method. However, there is no mouse model available for the H3.3f3a gene. Because of the lack of a suitable in vivo models, our knowledge on the status and the role of H3.3 in terminally differentiated cells and small populations of specialized cells is very scarce in mammals. hemagglutinin transcription start site transcription end site quantitative RT-PCR immunohistochemistry mouse embryonic fibroblast interferon IFN-stimulated gene fold change false discovery rate enhanced GFP. To study the activity of endogenous H3.3 in vivo, we generated, by homologous recombination, knockin mice that express HA-tagged H3.3 from the H3f3a and H3f3b loci. We report here that H3f3a-HA and H3f3b-HA proteins are expressed broadly in all adult tissues examined and mostly at similar levels, including various cell types in the immune system. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that H3.3 is enriched in expressed genes in a manner closely recapitulating levels of mRNA expression, its localization found from the promoter, the transcription start site (TSS) to the gene body, and the transcription end site (TES). Finally, we demonstrate that interferon stimulation causes rapid H3.3 incorporation within interferon-stimulated genes, highlighting a dynamic nature of H3.3 deposition. Together, these knockin mice would serve as a valuable model for studying the mode and mechanisms of H3.3 activity in cells in vivo, in heath and disease. With the aim of developing new mouse strains expressing tagged H3.3 from the endogenous loci, we replaced part of the H3f3a and H3f3b genes with an HA-tagged H3.3 cDNA cassette by homologous recombination. Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A schematically depict the strategy used. The exon 2 containing the ATG through exon 3 of the H3f3a and H3f3b loci were replaced by the cassette containing H3.3 cDNA fused to the HA and FLAG tag (hereafter H3f3A-HA and H3f3b-HA). An IRES-EGFP was inserted at the 3′ end, enabling independent monitoring of free EGFP expression from each locus. In addition, loxP sites were placed flanking the cassettes for potential conditional deletion. At the 3′ end of EGFP cDNA, drug selection marker, neomycin- or hygromycin-resistant gene flanked by FRT was placed in the H3f3a and H3fb targeting vector, respectively. The drug makers were later removed by crossing with FLP mice. The inserted HA-FLAG tag sequence is shown in Fig. S1B. Mice with germ line transmission were genotyped by PCR (Fig. 1A, lower panel, and Fig. S1C). Thus, the recombination at either locus did not alter the regulatory regions, promoters, 5′- and 3′-UTRs and introns (except a sequence between exon 2 and exon 3). Heterozygous mice were born as expected and grew with a comparable weight increase with WT mice. In addition, both males and females were fertile. Because the replacement of a single allele was sufficient to detect HA-tagged H3.3 and GFP expression, all experiments in this work were carried out with heterozygous mice. The number of homozygous H3f3a-HA and H3f3b-HA pups appeared somewhat lower than expected. In addition, the number of double knockin mice carrying both H3f3a-HA and H3f3b-HA pups appeared lower. The precise ratios of homozygous mice and double knockin mice await results of additional, mating experiments. In Fig. 1B, expression of WT or HA-tagged H3.3 mRNA was compared by qRT-PCR. H3f3a-HA and H3f3b-HA mRNA were expressed at varying levels in all adult tissues examined, closely paralleling that of WT mRNA for both loci. The expression was generally higher in the reproductive organs and tissues of the immune system but lower in liver, heart, and kidney. Expression of HA-tagged H3.3 protein was detected in various adult tissues by immunoblot analysis using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1C). H3.3A-HA and H3.3B-HA both migrated between 14- and 24-kDa molecular masses as expected and found in all tissues at similar levels. To examine detailed expression of HA-tagged H3.3, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for adult tissues. spleen, thymus, liver, kidney, brain, testis, and ovary. Our purpose was to assess whether H3.3 expression varies among tissues and among cells within a given tissue. In Fig. 2 (A–D), 5-μm sections from indicated organs from H3f3a-HA mice were stained with anti-HA antibody (right panel). Matching sections were stained with control IgG, counterstained with hematoxylin to localize the nuclei (left panel). Images acquired at low and high magnifications are shown. In spleen, most lymphocytes, residing in the white pulp and red pulp displayed robust HA stain. Similarly, most cells in thymus, both in medulla and cortex were positive for HA signals. In liver, HA stain was found widely in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Likewise, in kidney most cells, including those in the glomerular tubules were stained with anti-HA antibody. In the brain, again, neurons clustered in the hippocampus area exhibited strong HA signals, showing exclusive localization in the nuclei. In testis, spermatocytes and round spermatids were stained along with non–germ line Leydig cells and granulosa. In ovary, HA stain was found mostly in the nuclei of theca cells and oocytes but more sparsely in granulosa cells. Essentially, the same results were obtained from IHC analyses from the H3f3b-HA mice (Fig. S2). Thus, H3.3-HA is expressed broadly in most, if not all types of cells, in all adult tissues tested. To assess H3.3 expression in different cell types in further detail, we opted for monitoring GFP signals by flow cytometry. H3.3 expression was tested for T lymphocytes (CD3+), B lymphocytes, and myeloid cells from thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. Fig. 3 shows flow cytometry profiles of GFP-positive cells with CD3, B220, and CD11b markers. The cells from both H3f3a-HA and H3f3b-HA mice were tested, with cells from WT mice serving as a negative control for GFP. A large majority of cells in spleen (T cells, B lymphocytes, and myeloid cells) were GFP-positive in both H3f3a-HA and H3f3b-HA mice. Similarly, most of the thymic T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) expressed GFP. Likewise, most of B cells and myeloid cells residing in bone marrow were positive for GFP. The histograms in Fig. 3 (right panels) showed that GFP from H3f3a-HA and H3f3b-HA mice are expressed at comparable levels in each cell type in these tissues. Furthermore, in all cases GFP signals exhibited a narrow monophasic peak, indicating that H3.3 expression levels are largely uniform within each cell type. These results were reproducibly observed with samples from additional four mice aged from 6 to 10 weeks. We also found that the majority of macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells in spleen expressed GFP signals (Fig. S3). H3.3 deposition has traditionally been investigated by using exogenously introduced epitope-tagged H3.3 as a surrogate vector. The use of exogenous H3.3 vector has been accredited, because exogenous H3.3 was shown to be incorporated into nucleosomes and deposited in chromatin. Nevertheless, the use of exogenous vector has a potential caveat, in that regulated expression of endogenous H3.3 is not easily reproduced by an exogenous H3.3. The use of the knockin mice would obviate this caveat, presumably allowing more accurate assessment of H3.3 deposition. We thus examined genome-wide distribution of H3.3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) established from H3f3b-HA embryos. Confocal image of H3f3b-HA MEFs showed that H3.3-HA immunoreactivity was found predominantly in the “euchromatic” regions of the nucleus (Fig. 4A). On the other hand HA signals were generally low in 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole–dense “heterochromatic” regions, consistent with the results with exogenous H3.3 (5Tamura T. Smith M. Kanno T.

No HA stain was found in WT MEFs. ChIP-seq analysis was performed for growing MEFs using anti-HA antibody. We found a total of ∼40,700 H3.3-HA peaks, which were localized to three genomic regions, genic (blue), intergenic (red), and regulatory/promoter (green and other colors) (Fig. 4B). Nearly 60% of H3.3 signals were found in the genic regions (TSS, exons, and introns). Goldberg et al. (11Goldberg A.D. Banaszynski L.A. Noh K.M. Lewis P.W. Elsaesser S.J. Stadler S. Dewell S. Law M.

We thus tested whether H3.3 is enriched in telomeres in MEFs as well. We found that H3.3 signals were enriched in the consensus telomere repeats TTAGGGn and closely related telomeric repeats TTAGGn and TTAGGCn. As shown in Fig. 4C, H3.3 signals were significantly enriched in telomere repeats. On the other hand, H3.3 signals on other repeat sequences, LINE, SINE, LTR, SAT, or simple repeats were near or below the background. These results closely resemble those of Goldberg et al.(11Goldberg A.D. Banaszynski L.A. Noh K.M. Lewis P.W. Elsaesser S.J. Stadler S. Dewell S. Law M. Guo X. Li X. Wen D. Chapgier A. DeKelver R.C.

To correlate H3.3 deposition with transcription, we performed RNA-seq for the MEFs. In Fig. 4D, RNA-seq peak signals found on all annotated mouse genes were fractioned into 10 bins according to increasing transcripts levels (x axis), where the number of genes in each bin is shown on the y axis. Bin 1 represented 7,158 silent genes, and bin 10 denoted most highly expressed genes. Majority of expressed genes were in bin 5 to bin 7, peaking at bin 6. We next plotted average H3.3 deposition for genes in each bin (Fig. 4E). Strikingly, the amount of H3.3 deposition closely paralleled that of mRNA levels, i.e. the higher the RNA expression, the higher the H3.3 deposition and vice versa. It is interesting to note that for genes expressed at moderate levels (bins 3–6), H3.3 deposition peaked at/near the TSS, with fewer H3.3 signals over the gene body. This pattern of H3.3 accumulation has been reported as a general feature of H3.3 accumulation in many studies (11Goldberg A.D. Banaszynski L.A. Noh K.M. Lewis P.W. Elsaesser S.J. Stadler S. Dewell S.

However, for genes expressed at higher levels (bins 7–10), H3.3 signals increased more significantly over the gene body, with the greatest rise near or at the TES and beyond. H3.3 signals were virtually absent in silent genes (bin 1). Fig. 4F provides IGV screenshots of H3.3 deposition and RNA peaks for a low (bin 3: Vegfa) and high expressed genes (bin 10: Vim). Heat maps in Fig. S4A show H3.3 distribution on individual genes in each bin. Fig. 4 (F–I) shows average H3.3 deposition patterns over all genes, constitutively expressed genes and silent genes, respectively. Detailed heat maps for constitutive and silent genes Fig. 4 (H–I) are shown in Fig. S4 (B–D). We previously showed that IFN stimulation causes marked accumulation of H3.3 in a number of genes transcriptionally activated by IFN. In these studies, we monitored the deposition of virally transduced H3.3-HA in fibroblasts (5Tamura T. Smith M. Kanno T. Dasenbrock H. Nishiyama A. Ozato K. Inducible deposition of the histone variant H3.3 in interferon-stimulated genes.J. Biol.

To substantiate these observations for endogenous H3.3 and at a genome-wide level, ChIP-seq was performed for MEFs expressing H3f3b-HA stimulated by IFNβ for 6 h, in parallel with RNA-seq. We found ∼49,000 H3.3 peaks in IFN-treated cells, a significant increase over untreated cells, which had 40,700 peaks (Fig. 5A). This increase was presumably due to increased incorporation of the existing H3.3 into the chromatin rather than increased H3.3 expression (see H3f3a and H3f3b RNA peaks in Fig. S5A). Nevertheless, global pattern of H3.3 distribution in the genome was not substantially different between untreated and IFN-treated samples (pie chart in Fig. 5A). The Venn diagram in Fig. 5B shows that a large majority of H3.3 peaks were common in untreated and IFN-treated cells. RNA-seq found 932 genes up-regulated after IFN treatment (>1.5-fold change (FC) and FDR of 0.1), which were designated as ISGs (Fig. 5C and Table S1). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed enrichment in the type I IFN signaling, anti-viral, host defense, cytokine categories, as expected (Fig. S5B), whereas 699 genes were down-regulated by IFN treatment (Fig. 5C). Fig. 5D depicts H3.3 accumulation on ISGs, where H3.3 signals are plotted on three groups of ISGs, according to the degree of mRNA induction. The data showed that H3.3 deposition increased greatly in all ISGs. Interestingly, ISGs with the greatest induction (log2 FC > 4) showed the greatest increase in H3.3 deposition, those with intermediate induction (log2 FC 2–4) showed intermediate increase, and those with the least induction (log2 FC 1.5–2) showed the least increase in H3.3"

We reevaluated the relationship between CD25 expression and the leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) properties of AML using a patient-derived xenograft model. We divided lineage marker-negative (Lin–) CD34+CD38– or Lin–CD34+ cells from CD25-positive AML into CD25-positive and -negative populations, and then transplanted each population into NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/Sz mice. Leukemic engraftment was observed with both CD25-positive and -negative populations from three of nine CD25-positive AML patients. In two of those three patients, CD25-positive and -negative Lin–CD34+ cells engrafted at the primary transplantation led to leukemic engraftment at the secondary transplantation, in which engrafted cells contained both CD25-positive and -negative Lin–CD34+ AML cells. In an in vitro culture system, expression of CD25 was considerably induced in the CD25-negative population of Lin–CD34+ cells from two cases of CD25-positive AML. In one case, CD25-positive Lin–CD34+ cells gave rise to CD25-negative as well as -positive CD34+ cells. These observations suggest that there exist CD25-positive and -negative populations that can reconstitute CD25-positive AML in a patient-derived xenograft model, and that CD25 expression fluctuates in the LICs of AML."
https://openalex.org/W2905034540,"Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is one of the most common overuse injuries of the knee. Previous research has found that individuals with PFP exhibit differences in peak hip kinematics; however, differences in peak knee kinematics, where the pain originates, are difficult to elucidate. To better understand the mechanism behind PFP, we sought to characterize differences in knee gait kinematic waveform patterns in individuals with PFP compared to healthy individuals using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Sixteen control and sixteen individuals with PFP participated in a fast walk protocol. FFT was used to decompose the sagittal, frontal and transverse plane knee gait waveforms into sinusoidal signals. A two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc analysis compared group, limb and interaction effects on sagittal, frontal and transverse amplitude, frequency and phase components between control and PFP individuals gait waveforms. Differences in frequency and phase values were found in the sagittal and frontal plane knee waveforms between the control and PFP groups. The signal-to-noise ratio also reported significant differences between the PFP and control limbs in the sagittal (p<0.01) and frontal planes (p = 0.04). The findings indicate that differences in gait patterns in the individuals with PFP were not the result of amplitude differences, but differences attributed to temporal changes in gait patterns detected by the frequency and phase metrics. These changes suggest that individuals with PFP adopted a more deliberate, stiffer gait and exhibit altered joint coordination. And the FFT technique could serve as a fast, quantifiable tool for clinicians to detect PFP."
https://openalex.org/W2905176039,"The corneal endothelium, which originates from the neural crest via the periocular mesenchyme (PM), is crucial for maintaining corneal transparency. The development of corneal endothelial cells (CECs) from the neural crest is accompanied by the expression of several transcription factors, but the contribution of some of these transcriptional regulators to CEC development is incompletely understood. Here, we focused on activating enhancer-binding protein 2 (TFAP2, AP-2), a neural crest–expressed transcription factor. Using semiquantitative/quantitative RT-PCR and reporter gene and biochemical assays, we found that, within the AP-2 family, the TFAP2B gene is the only one expressed in human CECs in vivo and that its expression is strongly localized to the peripheral region of the corneal endothelium. Furthermore, the TFAP2B protein was expressed both in vivo and in cultured CECs. During mouse development, TFAP2B expression began in the PM at embryonic day 11.5 and then in CECs during adulthood. siRNA-mediated knockdown of TFAP2B in CECs decreased the expression of the corneal endothelium–specific proteins type VIII collagen α2 (COL8A2) and zona pellucida glycoprotein 4 (ZP4) and suppressed cell proliferation. Of note, we also found that TFAP2B binds to the promoter of the COL8A2 and ZP4 genes. Furthermore, CECs that highly expressed ZP4 also highly expressed both TFAP2B and COL8A2 and showed high cell proliferation.

The TFAP2 family members have a similar amino acid sequence and play an important role in various developmental stages. TFAP2A, TFAP2B, and TFAP2C are important in neural crest and facial formation. TFAP2D is highly expressed in the heart and retina, and TFAP2E is essential for differentiation and maturation of the olfactory bulb (10Eckert D. Buhl S. Weber S. Jäger R. Schorle H.

The TFAP2 family proteins form a dimer via a helix-span-helix motif and bind to DNA, which is thought to be composed of homodimers or heterodimers (10Eckert D. Buhl S. Weber S. Jäger R. Schorle H.

In one of these studies, RNA-Seq data showed only TFAP2B to be consistently expressed, and TFAP2A, TFAP2C, and TFAP2D were rarely expressed in adult and fetal CECs.

Regarding their use in regenerative medicine, cultured CECs have limited proliferative ability.

In our previous study, we found that the ZP4 molecule was a novel CEC-specific marker and was expressed in both in vivo and in vitro cultured CECs (20Yoshihara M. Ohmiya H. Hara S. Kawasaki S. FANTOM consortium Hayashizaki Y. Itoh M. Kawaji H. Tsujikawa M. Nishida K. Discovery of molecular markers to discriminate corneal endothelial cells in the human body.PLoS One. 2015; 10 (25807145): e011758110.1371/journal.pone.0117581PubMed Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few reports on specific transcription factors regulating CEC-specific functions, which are presumably controlled by several CEC-specific genes. The transcriptional regulation mechanism of TFAP2B in other tissues is not clear, and it is important to explore how it relates to the physiological function of the corneal endothelium. In this study, we examined the transcriptional regulation mechanism of the TFAP2B gene, which may lead to the elucidation of differentiation mechanisms important for the study of cell-based therapy in corneal endothelial regeneration. The expression pattern of the AP-2 family in the human corneal endothelium was confirmed by RT-PCR. TFAP2B mRNA was detected, whereas the mRNAs of other family members, TFAP2A, TFAP2C, TFAP2D, and TFAP2E, were not detected (Fig. 1A). TFAP2B protein was expressed in human CECs in vivo (Fig. 1B) with varying expression levels; the expression level in the peripheral region was 2.5-fold greater than that in the central region (Fig. 1C), and cells highly expressing TFAP2B were localized in the vicinity of the transition zone. Additionally, the TFAP2B protein was also expressed in in vitro cultured CECs (Fig. 1D). It has been reported that TFAP2B is important for mouse corneal endothelial development, particularly at E11.5 (when the PM migrates between the lens and corneal epithelium) and at E15.5 (when the corneal endothelium forms a single cell layer) (21Swamynathan S.K. Ocular surface development and gene expression.J. Ophthalmol. 2013; 2013 (23533700): 10394710.1155/2013/103947Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To investigate the distribution of TFAP2B during development, we performed immunofluorescence studies using both mouse embryos and adult mice. At E11.5, TFAP2B-expressing cells were localized in the PM (Fig. 2, A–D), whereas at E15.5 (Fig. 2, E–H) and adulthood (Fig. 2, I–L), TFAP2B was expressed in mouse CECs. These results suggested that TFAP2B protein was expressed in the PM and during subsequent steps and that it might be involved in gene regulation during CEC differentiation. TFAP2B was expressed in mouse CECs throughout all developing stages, from E11 to adulthood, possibly indicating that TFAP2B protein controls the expression of key molecules in CEC development and homeostasis. Then, to test whether genes are regulated by TFAP2B in cultured human CECs, we first analyzed its contribution using siRNA-mediated knockdown. The expression patterns of the neural crest marker SOX9; periocular mesenchyme markers PITX2, FOXC1, and FOXC2; and CEC markers ZO-1, Na+/K+-ATPase, COL8A1, COL8A2, and ZP4 were investigated using qRT-PCR in siRNA-treated CECs. Interestingly, the expression levels of COL8A2 and ZP4 mRNA in TFAP2B siRNA–transfected cells were significantly lower than those in the control siRNA–transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we validated their protein expression levels by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). COL8A2, which is the main component of the Descemet’s membrane synthesized from CECs, and ZP4, which is a plasma membranous protein, were selectively expressed in vivo in the corneal endothelium (Fig. 3C). In a whole-mount immunofluorescence study of the human corneal endothelium tissue, we found that ZP4 protein was strongly expressed in cells highly expressing TFAP2B (Fig. 3D) compared with those weakly expressing TFAP2B. In the cell proliferation assay, the proliferative capacity of TFAP2B siRNA–treated CECs also decreased compared with that of control siRNA–treated CECs (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that TFAP2B regulates the corneal endothelial cell–specific markers COL8A2 and ZP4 and promotes cell proliferation. Next, we determined the effect of TFAP2B on transcriptional activity in the COL8A2 and ZP4 promoters. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify the TFAP2B-binding motif in cultured CECs. In previous reports, a sequence consisting of nine nucleotides, 5′-S(G/C)CCTSR(A/G)GGS-3′, was reported to be a common binding sequence of the AP-2 family genes (22Woodfield G.W. Chen Y. Bair T.B. Domann F.E. Weigel R.J. Identification of primary gene targets of TFAP2C in hormone responsive breast carcinoma cells.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010; 49 (20629094): 948-96210.1002/gcc.20807Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Zhao F.

Genet. 2001; 69 (11505339): 695-70310.1086/323410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This AP-2–binding consensus sequence was found in the upstream region of the human COL8A2 and ZP4 promoters, both at approximately −3.0 kbp from their respective transcriptional start sites (Fig. 4, A and E). First, we performed EMSA to determine whether TFAP2B binds to the sequences of COL8A2 and ZP4. The results showed that the shifted bands were located in the WT sequences, but the artificially introduced mutation sequences did not bind to TFAP2B proteins (Fig. 4, B and F). The luciferase activity was found to be markedly high in the promoter region–containing vectors compared with that in the basic control vector (Fig. 4, C and G). The artificially introduced mutation within the TFAP2B candidate binding sites in the COL8A2 and ZP4 promoter regions significantly decreased luciferase activity in TFAP2B-overexpressing 293T cells (Fig. 4, B and E). For each gene, we also performed ChIP-PCR with anti-TFAP2B antibody in CECs. The assay confirmed the binding of TFAP2B proteins to the candidate binding site within the promoters of the COL8A2 and ZP4 genes in the primary CECs (Fig. 4, D and H). These data indicate that TFAP2B protein directly regulates the transcriptional activities of the COL8A2 and ZP4 genes in CECs. Because ZP4 has been reported as one of the cell-surface proteins (24da Cunha J.P. Galante P.A. de Souza J.E. de Souza R.F. Carvalho P.M. Ohara D.T. Moura R.P. Oba-Shinja S.M. Marie S.K.

To confirm the relationship between the expression of TFAP2B and ZP4, we performed purification experiments with cultured human CECs using an anti-ZP4 antibody. Among the cultured CECs, 14.4% of the cells were positively stained by ZP4 (Fig. 5A). qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the ZP4-expressing cells had significantly higher expression levels of TFAP2B and COL8A2, but those of COL8A1 were not significantly different (Fig. 5B). When ZP4-positive and ZP4-negative cells were respectively cultured, it was found that TFAP2B expression was high in ZP4-positive cells by immunofluorescence (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, ZP4-positive cells had a higher proliferative ability than ZP4-negative cells (Fig. 5, D and E). These data suggest that ZP4-expressing CECs may have a high proliferative potential. We previously identified TFAP2B as one of the corneal endothelium–specific transcription factors (13Yoshihara M. Hara S. Tsujikawa M. Kawasaki S. Hayashizaki Y. Itoh M. Kawaji H. Nishida K. Restricted presence of POU6F2 in human corneal endothelial cells uncovered by extension of the promoter-level expression atlas.EBioMedicine. 2017; 25 (29113774): 175-18610.1016/j.ebiom.2017.10.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear which genes were transcriptionally controlled by TFAP2B in CECs. Here, we demonstrate that the expression levels of functional markers such as ZO-1 and Na+/K+-ATPase and periocular mesenchymal markers such as PITX2 and FOXC1 were not affected by the knockdown of TFAP2B in CECs. It is possible that TFAP2B may play a different role between corneal endothelium–specific genes such as COL8A2 and ZP4 and functional markers that are not specific to CECs such as ZO-1 and Na+/K+-ATPase. However, it was previously reported that TFAP2B is required for the expression of ZO-1 in the corneal endothelium and is responsible for the barrier function during corneal development (25Chen L. Martino V. Dombkowski A. Williams T. West-Mays J. Gage P.J. AP-2β is a downstream effector of PITX2 required to specify endothelium and establish angiogenic privilege during corneal development.Invest. Ophthalmol Vis. Sci. 2016; 57 (26968737): 1072-108110.1167/iovs.15-18103Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Systemically, the expression of TFAP2B has been found in various tissues such as the skin, spinal cord, renal tubular epithelia, facial mesenchyme, and cornea (26Nelms B.L. Labosky P.A. Transcriptional Control of Neural Crest Development. Morgan and Claypool Life Sciences, San Rafael, CA2010Crossref Google Scholar). Mutation of the TFAP2B gene is known to cause Char syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease characterized by facial dysmorphism (27Satoda M. Zhao F. Diaz G.A. Burn J. Goodship J. Davidson H.R. Pierpont M.E. Gelb B.D. Mutations in TFAP2B cause Char syndrome, a familial form of patent ductus arteriosus.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25 (10802654): 42-4610.1038/75578Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Additionally, TFAP2B-deficient mice die in the postnatal period due to polycystic kidney disease (28Moser M. Rüschoff J. Buettner R. Comparative analysis of AP-2α and AP-2β gene expression during murine embryogenesis.Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208 (8989526): 115-12410.1002/(SICI)1097-0177(199701)208:1<115::AID-AJA11>3.0.CO;2–5Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recently, in the eye, the TFAP2B gene was suggested to be an early-onset glaucoma-causing gene in an analysis of periocular mesenchyme–specific TFAP2B knockout mice (29Martino V.B. Sabljic T.

COL8A2 is one of the major components of the Descemet's membrane along with COL8A1 and is generated from CECs (30Muragaki Y. Mattei M.G. Yamaguchi N. Olsen B.R. Ninomiya Y.

Moreover, the COL8A1/COL8A2 double-null mouse phenotype was found to be associated with anterior segment abnormality in the cornea (33Hopfer U. Fukai N. Hopfer H. Wolf G. Joyce N. Li E. Olsen B.R. Targeted disruption of Col8a1 and Col8a2 genes in mice leads to anterior segment abnormalities in the eye.FASEB J. 2005; 19 (16051690): 1232-124410.1096/fj.04-3019comCrossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We speculate that the relationship between TFAP2B and COL8A2 may be crucial in the developmental stage in CECs. We also identified ZP4 as a target gene of TFAP2B wherein TFAP2B binds to the ZP4 promoter region and directly induces the expression of the ZP4 protein. Furthermore, we found that ZP4 is a specific surface marker of human CECs (20Yoshihara M. Ohmiya H. Hara S. Kawasaki S. FANTOM consortium Hayashizaki Y. Itoh M. Kawaji H. Tsujikawa M. Nishida K.

Several corneal endothelial markers have previously been isolated such as sodium bicarbonate transporter–like protein 11, COL8A2, cysteine- and tyrosine-rich protein 1, glypican-4, cluster of differentiation 200 (CD200), and ZP4 (34Chng Z.

We previously showed that ZP4 was expressed in human CECs, oocytes, and other eye tissues but had little to no expression elsewhere in the body (20Yoshihara M. Ohmiya H. Hara S. Kawasaki S.

Although the specific function of ZP4 in CECs remains unclear, our data indicate that it is expressed in CECs with high proliferative capacity. We were able to isolate ZP4-expressing cells via FACS and found that ZP4 protein–expressing cells correlated with the increased expression of TFAP2B and COL8A2.

B. tropica) strain Ppe8, isolated from sugarcane, is part of the bacterial consortium recommended as inoculant to sugarcane. However, little information has been accumulated regarding this plant-bacterium interaction considering that it colonizes internal sugarcane tissues. Here, we made use of the RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis to study the influence of sugarcane stalk apoplast fluid on Ppe8 gene expression. The bacterium was grown in JMV liquid medium (100 ml), divided equally and then supplemented with 50 ml of fresh JMV medium or 50 ml of apoplast fluid extracted from sugarcane variety RB867515. Total RNA was extracted 2 hours later, the rRNAs were depleted and mRNAs used to construct libraries to sequence the fragments using Ion Torrent technology. The mapping and statistical analysis were carried out with CLC Genomics Workbench software. The RNA-seq data was validated by RT-qPCR using the reference genes fliP1, paaF, and groL. The data analysis showed that 544 genes were repressed and 153 genes were induced in the presence of apoplast fluid. Genes that induce plant defense responses, genes related to chemotaxis and movements were repressed in the presence of apoplast fluid, indicating that strain Ppe8 recognizes the apoplast fluid as a plant component. The expression of genes involved in bacterial metabolism was regulated (up and down), suggesting that the metabolism of strain Ppe8 is modulated by the apoplast fluid. These results suggest that Ppe8 alters its gene expression pattern in the presence of apoplast fluid mainly in order to use compounds present in the fluid as well as to avoid the induction of plant defense mechanisms. This is a pioneer study showing the role played by the sugarcane apoplast fluid on the global modulation of genes in P. tropica strain Ppe8."
https://openalex.org/W2905544513,"The bacterial leaf nodule symbiosis is a close interaction between endophytes and their plant hosts, mainly within the coffee family. The interaction between Rubiaceae species and Burkholderia bacteria is unique due to its obligate nature, high specificity, and predominantly vertical transmission of the endophytes to the next generation of host plants. This vertical transmission is intriguing since it is the basis for the uniqueness of the symbiosis. However, unequivocal evidence of the location of the endophytes in the seeds is lacking. The aim of this paper is therefore to demonstrate the presence of the host specific endophyte in the seeds of Psychotria punctata and confirm its precise location. In addition, the suggested location of the endophyte in other parts of the host plant is investigated.To identify and locate the endophyte in Psychotria punctata, a two-level approach was adopted using both a molecular screening method and fluorescent in situ hybridisation microscopy.The endophytes, molecularly identified as Candidatus Burkholderia kirkii, were detected in the leaves, vegetative and flower buds, anthers, gynoecium, embryos, and young twigs. In addition, they were in situ localised in leaves, flowers and shoot apical meristems, and, for the first time, in between the cotyledons of the embryos.Both independent techniques detected the host specific endophyte in close proximity to the shoot apical meristem of the embryo, which confirms for the first time the exact location of the endophytes in the seeds. This study provides reliable proof that the endophytes are maintained throughout the growth and development of the host plant and are transmitted vertically to the offspring."

Sentinel hospital-based surveillance, in three different Italian regions, revealed increased prevalence of norovirus infection in children (<15 years) in 2016 (14.4% versus 9.8% in 2015) and the emergence of GII.P16 strains in late 2016, which accounted for 23.0% of norovirus infections. The majority of the strains with a GII.P16 polymerase showed a GII.2 capsid genotype (79.5%). Also, a marked circulation of strains with a GII.17 capsid (14.0%) was observed, chiefly in early 2016. The emergence and global spread of non-GII.4 noroviruses pose challenges for the development of vaccine strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2905060723,"Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) provides important prognostic information of coronary atherosclerosis. We investigated intraobserver and interobserver QCT reproducibility in asymptomatic individuals, patients with acute chest pain without acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and patients with acute chest pain and ACS.Fifty patients from each cohort, scanned between 01/02/2010-14/11/2013 and matched according to age and gender, were retrospectively assessed for inclusion. Patients with no coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and poor image quality were excluded. Coronary atherosclerosis was measured semi-automatically by 2 readers. Reproducibility of minimal lumen area (MLA), minimal lumen diameter (MLD), area stenosis, diameter stenosis, vessel remodeling, plaque eccentricity, plaque burden, and plaque volumes was assessed using concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), Bland-Altman, coefficient of variation, and Cohen's kappa.A total of 84 patients (63 matched) were included. Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility estimates were acceptable for MLA (CCC = 0.94 and CCC = 0.91, respectively), MLD (CCC = 0.92 and CCC = 0.86, respectively), plaque burden (CCC = 0.86 and CCC = 0.80, respectively), and plaque volume (CCC = 0.97 and CCC = 0.95, respectively). QCT detected area and diameter stenosis ≥50%, positive remodeling, and eccentric plaque with moderate-good intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility (kappa: 0.64-0.66, 0.69-0.76, 0.46-0.48, and 0.41-0.62, respectively). Reproducibility of plaque composition decreased with decreasing plaque density (intraobserver and interobserver CCC for dense calcium (>0.99; 0.98), fibrotic (0.96; 0.93), fibro-fatty (0.95; 0.91), and necrotic core tissue (0.89; 0.84). Reproducibility generally decreased with worsening clinical risk profile.Semi-automated QCT of coronary plaque morphology is reproducible, albeit with some decline in reproducibility with worsening patient risk profile."
https://openalex.org/W2905070026,"The present study analyzes the relationship between three distal antecedents-financial literacy, confidence in retirement, and economic well-being-and financial planning for retirement evaluated at two different times. We used longitudinal data with repeated measures of financial planning for retirement obtained from a sample (N = 269) of active Spanish workers aged 45-62 years. The results confirm that self-perceived financial knowledge, confidence in retirement, and economic well-being are associated with financial planning for retirement at three and six months. The stability of financial planning for retirement over time was a relevant finding in the present research, even though different measures have been employed in the two waves and financial planning decreases slightly at three months. While the first step of planning, at three months, has predictive power over the second, at six months, there are possible moderators in the relationship between financial planning for retirement at time 1 and time 2, which were not explored. The implications of the results both for financial education and Policy-makers are discussed. Future lines of research can explore these relationships including objective measures of income, as wealth accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2905571351,"The membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) family of membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligases regulates the levels of cell-surface membrane proteins, many of which are involved in immune responses. Although their role in ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis and degradation of cell-surface proteins is extensively documented, the features of MARCH proteins and their substrates that drive the molecular recognition events leading to ubiquitin transfer remain poorly defined. In this study, we sought to determine the features of human MARCH9 that are required for regulating the surface levels of its substrate proteins. Consistent with previous studies of other MARCH proteins, we found that susceptibility to MARCH9 activity is encoded in the transmembrane (TM) domains of its substrates. Accordingly, substitutions at specific residues and motifs within MARCH9’s TM domains resulted in varying degrees of functional impairment. Most notably, a single serine-to-alanine substitution in the first of its two TM domains rendered MARCH9 completely unable to alter the surface levels of two different substrates: the major histocompatibility class I molecule HLA-A2 and the T-cell co-receptor CD4. Solution NMR analysis of a MARCH9 fragment encompassing the two TM domains and extracellular connecting loop revealed that the residues contributing most to MARCH9 activity are located in the α-helical portions of TM1 and TM2 that are closest to the extracellular face of the lipid bilayer. This observation defines a key region required for substrate regulation. In summary, our biochemical and structural findings demonstrate that specific sequences in the α-helical MARCH9 TM domains make crucial contributions to its ability to down-regulate its protein substrates.

How this unusual family of membrane-bound E3 ligases recognizes this wide variety of substrate proteins and what, specifically, identifies a membrane protein for MIR/MARCH-mediated regulation remain open questions. Several lines of evidence indicate that substrates are recognized through interactions encoded in the membrane-associated domains of substrates and MIR/MARCH proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2903854395,"Introduction Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is a common reason for presentation to emergency departments (ED), but the management of these episodes is often heterogeneous regardless of their potential impact on short-term adverse outcomes. Methods This was a longitudinal, retrospective study of all patients >40 years old admitted to the ED of two Spanish teaching hospitals for an AECOPD between January 1st and May 31st, 2016. All data were collected from electronic medical records. The primary outcomes were patient treatment at discharge and 90-day mortality. Logistic regression was used to model the determinants of 90-day mortality. Results Of the 465 included patients, 56% were prescribed a 3-drug combination at hospital discharge, 22% a 2-drug combination, 19% a single drug, and 4% other or no treatment. Approximately 8% of patients died within 90 days after an AECOPD. Multivariate logistic models revealed that having more than 2 severe exacerbations within the last 12 months (OR (95% CI): 15.12 (4.22–54.22)) and being prescribed a single drug at discharge (OR (95% CI): 7.23 (2.44–21.38)) were the main determinants of 90-day mortality after an AECOPD. Conclusions This study reflects the real-life heterogeneity in the pharmacological treatments prescribed after an ED admission for an AECOPD and suggests the potential impact of suboptimal inhaled treatment strategies on 90-day mortality rates."
https://openalex.org/W2906337567,"Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), encoded by the glyA gene, is a ubiquitous pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the formation of glycine from serine. The thereby generated 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate (MTHF) is a major source of cellular one-carbon units and a key intermediate in thymidylate biosynthesis. While in virtually all eukaryotic and many bacterial systems thymidylate synthase ThyA, SHMT and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) are part of the thymidylate/folate cycle, the situation is different in organisms using flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase ThyX. Here the distinct catalytic reaction directly produces tetrahydrofolate (THF) and consequently in most ThyX-containing organisms, DHFR is absent. While the resulting influence on the folate metabolism of ThyX-containing bacteria is not fully understood, the presence of ThyX may provide growth benefits under conditions where the level of reduced folate derivatives is compromised. Interestingly, the third key enzyme implicated in generation of MTHF, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), has a universal phylogenetic distribution, but remains understudied in ThyX-containg bacteria. To obtain functional insight into these ThyX-dependent thymidylate/folate cycles, we characterized the predicted SHMT from the ThyX-containing bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity was confirmed by functional genetic complementation of a glyA-inactivated E. coli strain. A H. pylori ΔglyA strain was obtained, but exhibited markedly slowed growth and had lost the virulence factor CagA. Biochemical and spectroscopic evidence indicated formation of a characteristic enzyme-PLP-glycine-folate complex and revealed unexpectedly weak binding affinity of PLP. The three-dimensional structure of the H. pylori SHMT apoprotein was determined at 2.8Ǻ resolution, suggesting a structural basis for the low affinity of the enzyme for its cofactor. Stabilization of the proposed inactive configuration using small molecules has potential to provide a specific way for inhibiting HpSHMT."
https://openalex.org/W2903698742,"The widespread use of remifentanil during total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) has raised concerns about the risk of postoperative remifentanil-associated pain. Although a recent meta-analysis suggests that remifentanil-associated pain is unlikely to occur in patients with TIVA because of the protective effect of co-administered propofol, the evidence is not conclusive. We retrospectively assessed 635 patients who received robotic thyroid surgery under TIVA to evaluate the risk of remifentanil-associated pain. Postoperative pain was evaluated using 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). Time dependent Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors of treatment-requiring pain (NRS > 4) during the first 48 postoperative hours. Postoperative pain rapidly decreased, and treatment-requiring pain remained in 12.8% (81 out of 635) of patients at 48 hours postoperatively. After adjusting for the time-dependent analgesic consumption, intraoperative use of remifentanil > 0.2 mcg/kg/min was a positive predictor of postoperative pain with a hazard ratio of 1.296 (95% C.I., 1.014–1.656, P = 0.039) during 48 hours after surgery. In conclusion, excessive use of remifentanil during TIVA was associated with increased risk of pain after robotic thyroid surgery. Prospective trials are required to confirm these results and determine whether decreasing remifentanil consumption below the threshold can reduce postoperative pain."
https://openalex.org/W2903724481,"Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including Ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1), are hypermethylated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TET1 catalytic domain (TET1-CD) induces genome-wide DNA demethylation to activate TSGs, but so far, anticancer effects of TET1-CD are unclear. Here we showed that after HCC cells were transiently transfected with TET1-CD, the methylation levels of TSGs, namely APC, p16, RASSF1A, SOCS1 and TET1, were distinctly reduced, and their mRNA levels were significantly increased and HCC cells proliferation, migration and invasion were suppressed, but the methylation and mRNA levels of oncogenes, namely C-myc, Bmi1, EMS1, Kpna2 and c-fos, were not significantly change. Strikingly, HCC subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice remained to be significantly repressed even 54 days after transient transfection of TET1-CD. So, transient transfection of TET1-CD may be a great advance in HCC treatment due to its activation of multiple TSGs and persistent anticancer effects."
https://openalex.org/W2905286696,"This study, conducted in the Netherlands, evaluated the association between ethnic background and children's TV viewing time at multiple time points and its trajectory. We analyzed 4,833 children with a Dutch, Moroccan, Turkish, or Surinamese ethnic background from the Generation R Study, a population-based study in the Netherlands. Parent-reported television viewing time for children at ages 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 years was collected by questionnaires sent from April 2004 until January 2015. Odds ratios of watching television ≥1 hour/day at each age were calculated for children from the various ethnic backgrounds. Generalized logistic mixed models (GLMMs) were used to assess the association between ethnic background and television viewing time trajectory. The effect modification by family socioeconomic status was examined in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. The percentage of children viewing television ≥1 hour/day increased from age 2 to 9 years for children from all ethnic backgrounds. After adjusting for maternal educational level and net household income, children from all ethnic subgroups had greater odds of watching television ≥1 hour/day at some time points compared with children with a Dutch background (Surinamese: all ages; Moroccan: at ages 4 and 6 years; Turkish: at ages 4 and 9 years). The GLMMs indicated that television viewing trajectories differed between ethnic subgroups. The associations between ethnic background and children's television viewing time were moderated by maternal educational level for child ages 4 and 6 years (p < 0.05). In longitudinal analyses, the ethnic differences in probability of watching television ≥1 hour/day were larger in children from high-educated mothers than in children from low-educated mothers. In conclusion, ethnic differences in television viewing time were present at all measuring time points. The discrepancy between children with a Dutch background and children with another background was larger in high maternal educational subgroups."
https://openalex.org/W2905527947,"Distance to health services is known to be negatively associated with usage and needle and syringe programs (NSPs) for people who inject drugs (PWID) are no different. Australia has a mixture of NSP modalities (primary or secondary fixed-site NSPs), which may present unique barriers to access. In this study, we explore 1) the effect of distance to NSPs on individual-level needle and syringe coverage, and 2) differences in coverage dependent on NSP modality. Using data from 219 PWID in an ongoing cohort study in Melbourne, Australia, we measured the straight-line distance from participants’ residence to their nearest primary or secondary fixed-site NSP. We analysed the relationship between geographical distance and coverage via regression analysis. The median distance to any type of NSP was 1872 metres. Regardless of service type, 52% of participants lived within 2 kms of a fixed-site NSP and 87% lived within 5 kms. We found no association between distance to NSPs and syringe coverage or a significant difference in coverage by nearest service type. Our findings suggest that the number and distribution of NSPs in Melbourne, Australia caters adequately for the population of PWID."

We compared the risk of infant mortality with a composite of fetal-infant mortality risk that would occur after expectant management for one additional week and evaluated the optimal time of delivery, in SGA and non-SGA pregnancies.In the total population, the risk of expectant management became significantly higher than the risk of delivery, at 39 weeks and beyond, similar with non-SGA group. In the SGA group, the risk of stillbirth was significantly greater at all GAs than for non-SGA pregnancies, and the risk of infant death was significantly increased until 38 weeks (25.8 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI 20.11-32.47), and the risk of stillbirth was significantly increased at 41 weeks (11.65 per 10,000 ongoing pregnancies, 95% CI 6.95-18.09), compared to 39 weeks (12 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI 8.98-15.64 and 5.12 per 10,000 ongoing pregnancies, 95% CI 3.84-6.66, respectively).In Korean women, delivery between 39 and 41 weeks minimizes fetal/infant mortality, in non-SGA pregnancies. In uncomplicated SGA pregnancies, delivery between 39 and 40 weeks can be considered to decrease risk of infant death and stillbirths."
