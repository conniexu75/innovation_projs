https://openalex.org/W2074276238,"Intracellular current administration evokes rapid, graded, and bidirectional mechanical responses of isolated outer hair cells from the mammalian inner ear. The cells become shorter in response to depolarizing and longer in response to hyperpolarizing currents in the synaptic end of the cell. The cells respond with either an increase or decrease in length to transcellular alternating current stimulation. The direction of the movement with transcellular stimuli appears to be frequency dependent. Iontophoretic application of acetylcholine to the synaptic end of the cell decreases its length. The microarchitecture of the organ of Corti permits length changes of outer hair cells in a manner that could significantly influence the mechanics of the cochlear partition and thereby contribute to the exquisite sensitivity of mammalian hearing."
https://openalex.org/W2014715442,"The consequences of two different mutations in the single essential actin structural gene of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were studied. Both conditional-lethal actin mutants exhibit six phenotypes at the restrictive temperature: disruption of the asymmetric staining pattern of actin assembly; delocalized deposition of chitin on the cell surface; partial inhibition of secretion of the periplasmic protein, invertase; an intracellular accumulation of secretory vesicles; death of cells in the budded portion of the cell cycle upon prolonged incubation at the restrictive condition; and osmotic sensitivity. These results implicate actin in the organization and polarized growth of the yeast cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2029377254,"A colony color assay that measures chromosome stability is described and is used to study several parameters affecting the mitotic maintenance of yeast chromosomes, including ARS function, CEN function, and chromosome size. A cloned ochre-suppressing form of a tRNA gene, SUP11, serves as a marker on natural and in vitro-constructed chromosomes. In diploid strains homozygous for an ochre mutation in ade2, cells carrying no copies of the SUP11 gene are red, those carrying one copy are pink, and those carrying two or more copies are white. Thus, the degree of red sectoring in colonies reflects the frequency of mitotic chromosome loss. The assay also distinguishes between chromosome loss (1:0 segregation) and nondisjunction (2:0 segregation). The most dramatic effect on improving mitotic stability is caused by increasing chromosome size. Circular chromosomes increase in stability through a size range up to approximately 100 kb, but do not continue to be stabilized above this value. However, linear chromosomes continue to increase in mitotic stability throughout the size range tested (up to 137 kb). It is possible that the mitotic stability of linear chromosomes is proportional to chromosome length, up to a plateau value that has not yet been reached in our synthetic constructions."
https://openalex.org/W2114138957,"The influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) mediates viral entry into cells by a low pH induced membrane-fusion event in endosomal vesicles. Mutant viruses with altered pH dependence for both hemolysis and the HA conformational change required for fusion were selected for their ability to grow in cells treated with amantadine hydrochloride, which raises the endosomal pH. The amino acid sequence and three-dimensional location of 19 substitutions on the HA are reported. The mutations fall into two groups, one that results in the destabilization of the pH 7.0 location of the hydrophobic N-terminal HA2 peptide, and a second that results in the alteration of intersubunit contacts, suggesting a large distortion or disruption of these contacts in the ""fusion-active"" conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1982765102,"Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 60 to 61 weeks to air containing 0, 625, or 1250 parts per million 1,3-butadiene. These concentrations are somewhat below and slightly above the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard of 1000 parts per million for butadiene. The study was designed for 104-week exposures but had to be ended early due to cancer-related mortality in both sexes at both exposure concentrations. There were early induction and significantly increased incidences of hemangiosarcomas of the heart, malignant lymphomas, alveolar-bronchiolar neoplasms, squamous cell neoplasms of the forestomach in males and females and acinar cell carcinomas of the mammary gland, granulosa cell neoplasms of the ovary, and hepatocellular neoplasms in females. Current workplace standards for exposure to butadiene should be reexamined in view of these findings."

https://openalex.org/W2085889764,"We have performed in vitro kinetic analyses of transcription from the 5S gene promoter in order to resolve the rate-limiting events which lead to accurate transcription of the 5S RNA gene. We demonstrate that a rate-limiting intermediate can be formed during an extended incubation prior to initiation of transcription. Formation of such a complex is temperature-dependent, requires magnesium and ATP, consists of stoichiometric amounts of the known class III transcription factors and RNA polymerase III on 5S DNA, and eliminates the normal lag in attainment of a steady-state rate of transcription. This complex is therefore different from the “stable complex” minimally required for template commitment. Further analyses demonstrate that TFIIIB, like TFIIIA and TFIIIC, can be stably sequestered on the 5S gene and also allow us to formulate the following order of factor interactions on the 5S gene: TFIIIA, TFIIIC, TFIIIB, RNA polymerase III."
https://openalex.org/W1481171004,"Short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases were purified to homogeneity from rat liver mitochondria by sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-50, hydroxyapatite, Matrex Gel Blue A, agarose-hexane-CoA, and Bio-Gel A-0.5m. Molecular, immunological, and catalytic properties of the pure acyl-CoA dehydrogenases were investigated. The native molecular weights of these three enzymes were 160,000, 180,000, and 180,000, respectively. The subunit molecular weights of the three enzymes were estimated to be 41,000, 45,000, and 45,000, respectively, indicating that these enzymes are each composed of four subunits of equal size. The FAD content was calculated to be 1 mol/mol of subunit. While FAD binding by short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was very tight, that by medium-chain acyl-CoA and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases was less tight. The medium- and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases were also purified to homogeneity as FAD-free apoenzymes. The apoenzymes were converted to the fully active holoenzymes by incubation with FAD. The three acyl-CoA dehydrogenases were immunologically distinct from each other, i.e. the antibodies raised against the individual enzymes were monospecific and did not cross-react with any other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Our preparations of the three enzymes exhibited substrate specificities (as defined in Vappmax and Kappmax) significantly more specific than those of the previous preparations isolated from other sources. The substrate specificities were assessed also by measuring the activities in mitochondrial sonicates after selectively precipitating each enzyme with their individual monospecific antibodies. Butyryl-CoA was almost exclusively dehydrogenated by short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase while C6-C10 acyl-CoAs were mainly dehydrogenated by medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. C14-C22 acyl-CoAs were exclusively dehydrogenated by long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. C24 acyl-CoAs were not dehydrogenated by this enzyme. Lauroyl-CoA appeared to be jointly dehydrogenated by the latter two enzymes. Branched-chain acyl-CoAs were not dehydrogenated by short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. In the presence of electron-transfer flavoprotein or phenazine methosulfate, 2-enoyl-CoAs were identified as products from the corresponding enzyme/acyl-CoA reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2018313564,"The cell migration pathway in the intestinal epithelium of DDK in equilibrium C57BL/6JLac mouse chimeras is demonstrated using Dolichos biflorus agglutinin-peroxidase as strain-specific marker. Cell sheets of one genotype extend in relatively straight lines from crypt to villus apex. Narrow sheets are mostly interrupted in the distal two-thirds of duodenal but not ileal villi, suggesting that in the duodenum cell loss occurs below the apical extrusion zone. These differences between duodenum and ileum correspond to differences in villus shape. The pattern of cell migration in Peyer's patch epithelium is consistent with that of the duodenum. In chimeric colon, sharply demarcated territories of crypts with a narrow cuff of surface epithelium represent the counterpart of the villus/crypt unit of the small intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1632209234,"Polysialosyl chains containing alpha 2-8-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid have been suggested to modulate the biological activity of a neural cell adhesion molecule. Polysialosyl glycopeptides isolated from developing brain were incubated with a bacteriophage containing endosialidase. Sialic acid oligomers up to 7 residues long were liberated both from the glycopeptides and colominic acid. The substrate specificity of the endosialidase was studied with sialic acid oligomers of different sizes prepared from colominic acid. It was found that the endosialidase required the simultaneous presence adjacent to the site of cleavage a minimum of 3 sialic acid residues on the distal side and a minimum of 5 sialic acid residues on the proximal (reducing end) side. From the fragments liberated by the enzyme the existence of polysialic acid chains up to at least 12 residues long in the glycopeptides were concluded. This was also supported by the interaction of the glycopeptides with a meningococcal group B polysaccharide antiserum, which was found to require 10 residues or more for binding. The results indicate that the brain polysialosyl glycopeptides contain a long polysialic acid segment, which is also specifically needed for certain molecular interactions. The implications of the findings for the biological properties of the neural cell adhesion molecule are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1482988026,"The metabolism of type I procollagen mRNAs was studied in confluent cultures of human skin fibroblasts using the recombinant plasmids Hf677 and Hf32, which contain DNA sequences complementary to human pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) mRNAs, respectively. The ratio for the amount of pro-alpha 1(I) mRNAs to pro-alpha 2(I) mRNAs was 2.06:1. These mRNAs were labeled during in vitro transcription of isolated nuclei in the ratio 2.16:1 and during a pulse in cellulo in the ratio 1.96:1, suggesting that the two species are synthesized in the ratio 2:1. No significant differences were found in the rates of degradation, the half-lives of the pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) mRNAs being 9.2 and 8.4 h, respectively. Addition of 10 microM cortisol to the growth medium reduced the amounts of the type I procollagen mRNAs by half in 6 h, leaving their ratio unaltered. Incubation of the cells with cortisol had only minor effects on the subsequent synthesis of the mRNAs in isolated nuclei in vitro, whereas the degradation rates in cellulo were distinctly accelerated."
https://openalex.org/W1995545446,"Reproductive isolation is induced by microorganisms in diverse geographic strains of the flour beetle Tribolium confusum (Coleoptera:Tenebrionidae). The incompatibility between populations is due to nongenetic cytoplasmically inherited factors. Males of infected strains produce no progeny when crossed with females of noninfected strains; however, they produce ""normal"" numbers of progeny when crossed with infected females. Males from noninfected strains show no reproductive isolation. Infected strains of T. confusum can be cured when tetracycline or other antibiotics are added to the flour medium. ""Cured"" strains become partially reproductively isolated from all noncured strains including the source strain"
https://openalex.org/W1525939685,"The cytochrome P1-450-dependent activity, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, and cytochrome P1-450 messenger RNA levels were studied in wild-type Hepa1c1c7 cells and in aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase-deficient mutants derived from this line. Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) induced both parameters approximately 50-fold in Hepa1c1c7 cells. Mutants in genes B and C that are affected in the functioning of the Ah receptor required for hydroxylase induction and dominant mutants had nondetectable or much reduced P1-450 mRNA levels and hydroxylase activities after TCDD treatment. Hybrids between wild-type cells and the dominant mutants were also deficient in these parameters. The dominant mutants therefore appear to express a trans-acting repressor of cytochrome P1-450 transcription. Mutants in gene A were heterogenous. Some lacked the mRNA completely; others were inducible for it; while still others (subgroup IV) had high levels even when they were grown without TCDD. These results suggest strongly that gene A is the structural gene for cytochrome P1-450. When subgroup IV mutants were cultured together with wild-type cells, they failed to express P1-450 mRNA in the absence of TCDD treatment. These cells probably accumulate an inducer that can be metabolized by aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase. The inducer did not appear to be a component of the medium and therefore may be an endogenous ligand of the Ah receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2051193061,"Left-handed Z-DNA binds tightly to Ustilago recl protein. The binding reaction is strongly dependent on ATP, but complexes formed are rapidly dissociated by ADP. The parallel between the kinetics of Z-DNA binding and the synaptic pairing reaction leading to paranemic joint molecules suggests that formation of nascent heteroduplex structures in recombination is coupled with formation of left-handed Z-like DNA on the protein. Equilibrium and kinetic studies show that recl protein appears to have a strong Z-DNA binding site that binds Z-DNA 75 times tighter than the B form of the DNA. We propose that DNA with a structure approximated best by a left-handed Z-DNA conformation is a key intermediate in homologous pairing promoted by recl protein."
https://openalex.org/W1567855625,"A novel calcium-binding protein named CAB-63 (formerly called calregulin) has been purified from bovine liver 100,000 X g supernatant. The purified protein has been characterized with respect to its physical, chemical, and calcium-binding properties. It has an apparent molecular weight of 63,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 55,000 by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation under nondenaturing conditions. It is an asymmetric molecule with a frictional coefficient of 1.69 and a Stokes radium of 44.2 A. Amino acid analysis has revealed 34.0% acidic residues, 14.0% basic residues, and 4.0% tryptophan. The acidic nature of the molecule is further confirmed by its isoelectric point of 4.65. In the presence of 3 mM MgCl2 and 150 mM KCl, CAB-63 binds 3.0 mol of calcium/mol of protein with an apparent Kd = 0.1 microM. Immunoblotting and Ouchterlony double-diffusion procedures have identified CAB-63 in a variety of bovine tissues. Immunocytochemical staining of both fibroblasts and cryotome-sectioned bovine liver further indicates that CAB-63 immunoreactivity is restricted to an elaborate system of perinuclear membranous vacuoles and cisternae indistinguishable from immunocytochemical staining of the endoplasmic reticulum. It is concluded that CAB-63 represents a major calcium-binding protein whose subcellular organization suggests a possible role in the function of the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1573954448,"The internalization of a fluorescent analogue of phosphatidylethanolamine following its insertion into the plasma membrane of cultured Chinese hamster fibroblasts was examined. When liposomes composed of 50 mol % 1-acyl-2-(N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)-aminocaproyl phosphatidylethanolamine (C6-NBD-PE) and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine were incubated with monolayer cell cultures at 2 degrees C, a spontaneous transfer of the fluorescent lipid from liposomes to cells occurred. As long as the cells were kept at 2 degrees C, the fluorescent lipid remained at the plasma membrane. However, if, after removing the fluorescent liposomes, the cultures were warmed to 37 degrees C, the C6-NBD-PE was internalized and resided in the nuclear envelope, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus in addition to the plasma membrane. Delivery of the fluorescent lipid to the Golgi apparatus could be blocked by the addition of 2-deoxyglucose plus sodium azide to the incubation medium. Evidence is presented suggesting that while delivery of the fluorescent lipid to the Golgi apparatus was mainly dependent on endocytosis, delivery to the nuclear envelope and mitochondria occurred by rapid transbilayer movement of the lipid across the plasma membrane followed by translocation of lipid monomers. Rapid transbilayer movement of C6-NBD-PE across the plasma membrane was found to be a temperature-dependent process that was blocked below 7 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W2991986622,"A crude membrane fraction from promastigotes of Leishmania donovani grown in a liquid culture medium containing 20% fetal calf serum was prepared by freeze-thawing, centrifugation (200,000 X g, 30 min), and extraction with 2% (w/v) sodium cholate. After removal of the bile salt by chromatography on a Sephadex G-75 column, the solubilized membrane protein fraction, rich in acid phosphatase activity, was chromatographed on columns containing concanavalin A-Sepharose, QAE-Sephadex, and Sephadex G-150 and G-100. Three distinct acid phosphatases were resolved: the major phosphatase activity (70% of the total) was L-(+)-tartrate-resistant (designated ACP-P1) and corresponds to the acid phosphatase localized to the outer surface of the parasite's plasma membrane; the other two phosphatases (ACP-P2 and ACP-P3) account for the remaining 30% of the particulate acid phosphatase activity, and both of these enzymes are L-(+)-tartrate-sensitive. Using a combination of sucrose density gradient centrifugation, gel filtration chromatography, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it was determined that ACP-P1 is a 128,000-dalton protein composed of two subunits of 65,000-68,000 daltons. ACP-P1 has an isoelectric point of 4.1, a pH optimum of 5.5, hydrolyzes fructose 1,6-diphosphate, but no other sugar phosphates and dephosphorylates phosphotyrosine, yeast mannan, and the phosphorylated form of rat liver pyruvate kinase. ACP-P2 (pI, 5.4) and ACP-P3 (pI, 7.1) with molecular masses of 132,000 and 108,000 daltons, respectively, are both tartrate-sensitive and are distinguished from each other on the basis of their sensitivity to inhibition by polyanionic molybdenum complexes. These two phosphatases also have their pH optima in the pH 5.0-6.0 range, but have a considerably broader substrate specificity than ACP-P1."

This coupling could be due to an electrical synapse and could provide the basis for the flare associated with the axon reflex.
https://openalex.org/W1570124205,"Isoprene formation in a rat liver cytosolic fraction is shown to be increased 146-fold by acid treatment. This acid catalysis is dependent upon prior incubation of the cytosolic fraction with DL-mevalonate and is stimulated when the incubation also contains ATP. Formation of isoprene proceeds linearly through 5 h of acid treatment and is nearly complete at 10 h. These results suggest that the acid-catalyzed isoprene formation arises from the decomposition of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate via a carbonium ion mechanism. Chemical model studies using 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol and 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol (the alcohols corresponding to dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate, respectively) confirm this hypothesis. At a pH less than or equal to 1, an 85% decomposition of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol to isoprene occurred after 24 h, while 3% of 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol was converted to isoprene under identical conditions and time. It is concluded that the predominant immediate precursor of isoprene is dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and at low pH the ultimate fate of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate is complete conversion to isoprene. These conclusions have important biochemical and methodological implications."
https://openalex.org/W1526415700,"Monolayer cultures of hepatocytes isolated from cholestyramine-fed rats and incubated in serum-free medium converted exogenous [4-14C]cholesterol into bile acids at a 3-fold greater rate than did cultures of hepatocytes prepared from untreated rats. Cholic acid and beta-muricholic acid identified and quantitated by gas-liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography were synthesized by cultured cells for at least 96 h following plating. The calculated synthesis rate of total bile acids by hepatocytes prepared from cholestyramine-fed animals was approximately 0.058 micrograms/mg protein/h. beta-Muricholic acid was synthesized at approximately a 3-fold greater rate than cholic acid in these cultures. Cultured hepatocytes rapidly converted the following intermediates of the bile acid pathway; 7 alpha-hydroxy[7 beta-3H]cholesterol, 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-[6 beta-3H] cholesten-3-one, and 5 beta-[7 beta-3H]cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol into bile acids. [24-14C]Chenodeoxycholic acid and [3H]ursodeoxycholic acid were rapidly biotransformed to beta-muricholic acid. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity measured in microsomes of cultured hepatocytes decreased during the initial 48 h following plating, but remained relatively constant for the next 72 h. In contrast, cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity appeared to decrease during the first 48 h, followed by an increase over the next 48 h. Despite the apparent changes in enzyme activity in vitro, the rate of bile acid synthesis by whole cells during this time period remained constant. It is concluded that primary monolayer cultures of rat hepatocytes can serve as a useful model for studying the interrelationship between cholesterol and bile acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1565663925,"The amounts of the various forms of DNA polymerase (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, and gamma) have been determined in oocytes, eggs, and embryos of the frog, Xenopus laevis. During oogenesis the relative proportions and absolute levels of all forms changed dramatically. In stage I (early) oocytes, DNA polymerase-gamma, the mitochondrial polymerase, was the predominant form. During oocyte growth, DNA polymerase-alpha 1 and -alpha 2 increased by more than 100-fold, DNA polymerase-beta by 15-fold, and DNA polymerase-gamma by only 8-fold. During oocyte maturation and ovulation, the levels of all forms of DNA polymerase roughly doubled. The mature stage VI oocyte contained 5 orders of magnitude more DNA polymerase activity than is found in an individual somatic cell. DNA polymerase-alpha 1 and -alpha 2, the replicative polymerases, were the predominant forms in mature oocytes and ovulated unfertilized eggs. During fertilization, the relative proportions and absolute levels of the four forms remained constant. During subsequent stages of embryogenesis, the total amounts of DNA polymerase-alpha 1 and -alpha 2 declined slightly from cleavage through gastrulation, the stages of most rapid chromosomal DNA replication. The rapid increase in cell number during early embryogenesis establishes the same levels of DNA polymerase/cell as are present in adult somatic cells. After neurulation, the absolute levels of DNA polymerase-alpha 1 and -alpha 2 increased in proportion to increases in cell number. The absolute levels of DNA polymerase-beta remained constant, and the levels of DNA polymerase-gamma increased 2-fold throughout embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2141455660,"Menkes' disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, is characterized by the accumulation of excess copper-metallothionein in certain tissues and cell types. Using cultured fibroblasts, we show that this is due to the ability of low concentrations of copper to induce metallothionein mRNA synthesis in Menkes' but not normal cells. We also show that copper, which is unusually toxic to Menkes' cells, induces the synthesis of 84 kd and 68 kd polypeptides tentatively identified as heat shock proteins. Transfection experiments with a cloned metallothionein fusion gene show that this is due to a defect in a diffusible factor involved in either metallothionein gene transcriptional regulation or copper metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2091211001,"It has been generally accepted that infected fleas do not pass on Rickettsia mooseri, or indeed any other known pathogen, to their progeny. It is reported here that such transovarial transmission does occur in laboratory-infected Xenopsylla cheopis fleas. By means of the direct fluorescent antibody test, Rickettsia mooseri was observed in cells of the hemolymph of infected fleas. As many as 11 percent of the adults and 2.9 percent of the larvae of the generation reared therefrom, had demonstrable rickettsiae. Moreover, batches of the F1 fleas were capable of transmitting the infection to more than 18 percent of the rats they infested. The data support the contention that Xenopsylla cheopis fleas play an important role in the maintenance of murine typhus in rats in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2045622186,"It has previously been shown that a yeast RNA polymerase III transcription factor binds stably to tRNA genes. The principal protein-DNA contacts have now been mapped, by dimethylsulfate footprinting, to the vicinity of the A and B block promoter regions of the S. cerevisiae tRNALeu3 gene. Single-stranded DNA preferentially interferes with the binding of the transcription factor to one of the promoter regions. The effect of temperature on the formation of the transcription factor-DNA complex has been examined: the complex has the kind of ""opening"" property that has been previously associated with prokaryotic RNA polymerase-promoter complexes, with stability increasing as the temperature is raised."
https://openalex.org/W2076820575,"Experimental chimeras were produced by aggregating morulae from congenic strains of PVG rats differing in the major histocompatibility complex (RTI). Monoclonal antibodies against variant class I antigens of the two strains were directly conjugated to iodine-125 and applied to tissue sections. Autoradiograms allowed examination of most internal tissues. The proportion of PVG-RTIa cells in the erythrocyte populations of the chimeras varied from 8 to 70 percent, as determined with fluorescence-activated flow cytometry. Digital analysis of autoradiograms demonstrated that the contribution of PVG-RTIa cells to the livers of the chimeras ranged from 34 to 86 percent. Patches of cells of each genotype in the liver were geometrically complex, with large variations in size. The thymus, but not the spleen, showed evidence of oligoclonal development. The adrenal cortex revealed a radially striped pattern, suggestive of clonal expansion of stem cells. With this approach it is possible to measure cell distribution in chimeras through direct histological visualization, which may prove useful in the study of rat organogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1494530774,"Alkaline phosphatase of matrix vesicles isolated from fetal bovine epiphyseal cartilage was purified to apparent homogeneity using monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography. The enzyme from the butanol extract of matrix vesicles bound specifically to the immobilized antibody-Sepharose in the presence of 2% Tween 20 whereas the major portion of nonspecific protein was removed by this single step. Of various agents tested, 0.6 M 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, pH 10.2, was the most effective in eluting 80-100% of the enzyme initially applied. Both Tween 20 and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol associated with the eluted enzyme were effectively removed by the sequential application of DEAE-cellulose and Sepharose CL-6B chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme preparation treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol showed the presence of a dominant band (using silver staining) corresponding to a molecular weight of 81,000. This molecular weight was nearer reported values for rat liver (Ohkubo, A., Langerman, N., and Kaplan, M. M. (1974) J. Biol Chem. 249, 7174-7180) and porcine kidney (Cathala, G., Brunel, C., Chapplet-Tordo, D., and Lazdunski, M. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 6040-6045) alkaline phosphatase, than to previously reported values for chicken (Cyboron, G. W., and Wuthier, R. E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 7262-7268) and fetal calf (Fortuna, R., Anderson, H. C., Carty, R. P., and Sajdera, S. W. (1980) Calcif. Tissue Int. 30, 217-225) cartilage matrix vesicle alkaline phosphatase. The purified alkaline phosphatase was activated by micromolar Mg2+. The amino acid composition of cartilage alkaline phosphatase was found to be similar to that previously described for porcine kidney (Wachsmuth, E. D., and Hiwada, K. (1974) Biochem. J. 141, 273-282). Double immunoprecipitation data indicated that monoclonal antibody against cartilage alkaline phosphatase cross-reacted with fetal bovine liver or kidney enzyme but failed to react with calf intestinal or rat cartilage enzyme. Thus these observations suggest that alkaline phosphatase of matrix vesicles from calcifying epiphyseal cartilage is a liver-kidney-bone isozyme."

Vaccination with an antigen having a molecular weight of 155,000 gave partial protection against challenge in some batches of mice and in a group of cynomolgus monkeys. Vaccination with an antigen having a molecular weight of 53,000 gave similar levels of protection in mice. The results demonstrate that protection can be obtained with single antigens, but the precise requirements for reproducible vaccination are as yet unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1480141269,"The mechanisms of the initial interactions of three rat liver acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases) and their fatty acyl-CoA substrate were studied using enzyme-catalyzed deuterium exchange. The reaction products were identified and quantitated using mass spectroscopy and 1H-NMR. When fatty acyl-CoA substrates were incubated with catalytic amounts of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase in D2O in the absence of an electron acceptor, a rapid monodeuteration of the substrate occurred to replace one of the prochiral C-2 hydrogens, while no C-3 hydrogens were exchanged with deuterium. The C-2 monodeuteration proceeded to the extent of 80% of the total amount of substrate added at 90 min and almost to completion at 120 min. The pKa values and optimum pD values for the C-2 proton/deuteron exchange reactions were 6.0 and 7.5, respectively, for each of the three acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. The apparent turnover numbers were 3.0, 3.3, and 0.5 s-1 for short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, respectively. These results provide the first direct evidence for carbanion formation via abstraction of a C-2 hydrogen by a base in the enzyme, as the first step of the catalytic pathway of acyl-CoA dehydrogenation. When the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases were reacted with moderate excesses of acyl-CoA substrates in D2O in the absence of an electron acceptor, maximum bleaching of the FAD absorbance and the appearance of the long wavelength absorbance, attributed to a charge transfer complex, were observed. However, the dehydrogenation products, 2-enoyl-CoAs, were produced either not at all or in an amount which represented only a minor fraction of the amount of the enzyme added, while the substrates in the enzyme-substrate complexes rapidly turned over as indicated by the extensive monodeuteration which concomitantly occurred. Unlike previous hypothesis, these results indicate that the hydride ion transfer from C-3 of the substrate to the enzyme-FAD is not yet complete in the charge-transfer complex. The transfer of the hydride ion to alloxazine N-5 and the release of products are completed only in the presence of electron-transfer flavoprotein or another suitable electron acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1569391429,"Local amine anesthetics appear to exert their effects in the charged (protonated) form on the cytoplasmic side of excitable membranes. Two features of interest are the mechanism whereby these drugs move across the membrane to the inner monolayer and the actual membrane concentrations achieved. In this work, we have investigated the influence of a K+ diffusion potential, delta psi, on the transmembrane distribution and concentration of the local anesthetic dibucaine employing large unilamellar vesicle systems. It is demonstrated that egg phosphatidylcholine large unilamellar vesicles exhibiting a delta psi (interior negative) actively accumulate dibucaine to achieve high interior concentrations. 31P and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance studies show that the internalized drug is localized to the vesicle inner monolayer, and suggest that the protonated form of the anesthetic is the species that is actively transported. The inner monolayer anesthetic concentrations thus achieved can be an order of magnitude or more larger than predicted on the basis of anesthetic lipid-water partition coefficients. It is suggested that these effects may be related to the mechanisms whereby local anesthetics are localized and concentrated at their sites of action in nerve membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1518062260,"The kinetics of reduction of oxidized Clostridium pasteurianum rubredoxin (Rdox) by free flavin semiquinones generated by the laser flash photolysis technique and by spinach ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (FNR) semiquinone (also produced by flavin semiquinone reduction) have been investigated under anaerobic conditions. 5-Deazariboflavin semiquinone (5-dRf) rapidly reduces oxidized rubredoxin (Rdox) (k = 3.0 X 10(8) M-1 S-1) and oxidized ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (FNRox) to the semiquinone level (k = 5.5 X 10(8) M-1 S-1). Lumiflavin semiquinone reduces Rdox more slowly (k = 1.3 X 10(7) M-1 S-1) and is not measurably reactive with FNRox. Absorption difference spectroscopy and difference CD indicate that Rdox and FNRox form a 1:1 complex at low ionic strength (10 mM), which is completely dissociated at higher ionic strength (310 mM). Apparent second order rate constants for reduction of Rdox in its free and complexed state by lumiflavin semiquinone are the same. Reduction of Rdox (both free and complexed) by free FNR semiquinone and intracomplex electron transfer were investigated using 5-dRf as the reductant. At I = 10 mM, a first order rate constant of 2.0 X 10(3) S-1 was obtained, which corresponds to the processes involved in intracomplex electron transfer from FNR semiquinone to Rdox. A second order reaction between free FNR semiquinone and complexed Rdox was also observed to occur (k = 5 X 10(7) M-1 S-1). At I = 310 mM, these reactions are not observed and the reaction of FNR semiquinone with free Rdox is second order (k = 4 X 10(6) M-1 S-1)."
https://openalex.org/W1565298428,"Cleavage of parathyroid hormone by cathepsin D was studied. Four primary products were detected and separated by high performance liquid chromatography. Two of the fragments are fluorescent and therefore contain residue 23 (tryptophan). These fragments are NH2-terminal in origin. The other two cross-react with antisera directed against COOH-terminal portions of the hormone; they are the complementary COOH-terminal fragments. Microsequencing and amino acid analysis showed that the two COOH-terminal fragments are 35-84 and 38-84 bovine parathyroid hormone. By CNBr cleavage and amino acid analysis, the two NH2-terminal fragments were shown to be the complementary 1-37 and 1-34 fragments. The 1-37 fragment is transitory and is rapidly hydrolyzed to 1-34, so that only relatively small amounts are detected at any one time. However, 34-84 was not converted to 38-84, although cleavage at other sites in the COOH-terminal fragments was observed with more exhaustive digestion. The 1-34 fragment appears to be the final product of the action of cathepsin D on parathyroid hormone. Both enzymatically produced NH2-terminal fragments were fully active in the renal membrane adenylyl cyclase assay system."
https://openalex.org/W1530572244,"There is considerable evidence that tubulin exists in multiple isotypes, differing in amino acid sequence and tissue distribution. Little is known, however, about the functional significance of these isotypes. Chicken erythrocyte beta-tubulin has been shown by peptide mapping to differ significantly from chicken brain beta-tubulin (Murphy, D. B., and Wallis, K. T. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7870-7875). We now find that when the two tubulins, in their native states, are incubated with N,N'-ethylenebis(iodoacetamide) (EBI), a bifunctional sulfhydryl-directed reagent, microtubule assembly by brain tubulin is much more sensitive to inhibition by EBI than is erythrocyte tubulin assembly. The resistance of erythrocyte microtubule assembly to inhibition by EBI is correlated with a low reactivity of erythrocyte tubulin with [14C]EBI. This difference is most marked in the beta subunit which reacts 15 and 17% as well, respectively, with [14C]EBI as do the beta 1 and beta 2 subunits of brain tubulin. Also, erythrocyte beta reacts about 33% as well as does brain beta with iodo[14C]acetamide. These results suggest that a reactive sulfhydryl group, whose oxidation prevents microtubule assembly, is present in brain tubulin but absent or inaccessible in erythrocyte tubulin. Since purified erythrocyte tubulin self-aggregates much more readily than does brain tubulin, it is conceivable that erythrocyte and brain tubulin may differ in that the latter may have its assembly subject to a complex regulation, while erythrocyte tubulin assembly may be regulated by a simpler mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1580561229,"DNA polymerase-alpha and -beta were fractionated from the chromatin of regenerating liver of young and old mice. The DNA polymerases were resolved from each other and partially purified by DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, and DNA-cellulose column chromatography. No significant age-related difference in the kinetics of heat inactivation was observed for either DNA polymerase. No age-dependent difference was found in the fidelity with which these enzymes copied phi X174 DNA. These results suggest that the functional properties of these DNA polymerases do not change with age as is postulated in some theories of aging."
https://openalex.org/W1547053328,"We have examined the selectivity of rat liver microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EC 3.3.2.3) toward all of the possible positional isomers of benzo-ring diol epoxides and tetrahydroepoxides of benz[a]anthracene, as well as the 1,2-diol 3,4-epoxides of triphenylene. This set includes compounds with no bay region in the vicinity of the benzo-ring, a bay-region diol group, a bay-region epoxide group, and (for the triphenylene derivatives) both a bay-region diol and a bay-region epoxide. In all cases where both the tetrahydroepoxides and the corresponding diol epoxides were examined, there is a large retarding effect of hydroxyl substitution on the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed hydration. When the tetrahydroepoxides are fair or poor substrates (epoxide group in the 1,2-, 8,9-, or 10,11-position), the additional retardation introduced by adjacent hydroxyl groups causes the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the corresponding diol epoxides to be insignificantly slow or nonexistent. In contrast, a benz[a]anthracene derivative with an epoxide group in the 3,4-position, (-)-tetrahydrobenz[a]anthracene (3R,4S)-epoxide, has been identified as the best substrate known for epoxide hydrolase, with a Vmax at 37 degrees C and pH 8.4 of 6800 nmol/min/mg of protein, and the two diastereomeric (+/-)-benz[a]anthracene 1,2-diol 3,4-epoxides, unlike all the other diol epoxides examined to date, are moderately good substrates for epoxide hydrolase. This novel observation is accounted for by the fact that the very high reactivity of the tetrahydrobenz[a]anthracene 3,4-epoxide system towards epoxide hydrolase is large enough to overcome a kinetically unfavorable effect of hydroxyl substitution. The enantioselectivity and positional selectivity of the enzyme have been determined for the tetrahydro-1,2- and -3,4-epoxides of benz[a]anthracene as well as the 1,2-diol 3,4-epoxides. When the epoxide is located in the 3,4-position, the benzylic carbon is the preferred site of attack, whereas for the enantiomers of the bay-region tetrahydro-1,2-epoxides, the chemically less reactive non-benzylic carbon is preferred. The regio- and enantioselectivity of epoxide hydrolase are discussed in terms of a possible model for the hydrophobic binding site of this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1548710149,"Ten murine monoclonal antibodies have been produced that are specific for bovine milk lipoprotein lipase. One monoclonal antibody, bLPL-mAb-7, inhibited completely the apolipoprotein C-II (apo-C-II)-dependent enzymic hydrolysis of trioleoylglycerol in a phospholipid-stabilized emulsion, but had no effect on the hydrolysis of the water-soluble substrate p-nitro-phenylacetate. Four times more bLPL-mAb-7 was required to achieve 50% inactivation of lipoprotein lipase activity when the enzyme was preincubated with excess apo-C-II. Disruption of the binding of a dansyl-labeled apo-C-II peptide to lipoprotein lipase by bLPL-mAb-7 was demonstrated by resonance energy transfer, both in the presence and absence of lipid. This antibody thus appears to recognize the apo-C-II binding site of lipoprotein lipase. In addition, bLPL-mAb-7 also inhibited the lipoprotein lipase activity of human post-heparin plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1597210536,"Medium-chain and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases from rat liver have been purified in two forms, holoenzymes containing FAD and apoenzymes which do not contain this cofactor. In contrast, short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase can only be isolated as the holoenzyme. Marked differences in the reactivity to organic sulfhydryl reagents were observed between the apo and holo forms of these enzymes. While the two apoenzymes were severely inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB), and iodoacetate (IAA), the two corresponding holoenzymes were not susceptible to these reagents. The inactivation of the two apoenzymes by NEM followed pseudo-first order kinetics. Incubation of the apoenzymes with FAD completely prevented the inactivation by the organic sulfhydryl reagents. Methylmercury halides (iodide or chloride) inactivated both the apo and holo forms of medium-chain and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. On the other hand, holo-short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase behaved somewhat differently from the other two holoenzymes in that it was inactivated by pCMB (but not NEM or IAA) following a pseudo-first order process. The titration of the two apoenzymes with [14C]NEM and that of the holo-short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase with [14C]pCMB indicated that all three acyl-CoA dehydrogenases contain a single essential cysteine residue/subunit. In the inactivation of holo-medium-chain and holo-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases with methylmercury halide, the same essential cysteine residue was modified without perturbing or releasing the enzyme-bound FAD. The inactivations of the three holoenzymes by appropriate organic sulfhydryl reagents were prevented by prior incubation with substrate. These experimental results indicate that the essential cysteine residue is located in the vicinity of the FAD- and substrate-binding sites within the active center of the enzymes. It appears, however, that this cysteine residue does not participate directly in FAD binding."
https://openalex.org/W1551044157,"Tetranitromethane inhibits acetylcholinesterase with respect to the hydrolysis of both acetylthiocholine and indophenyl acetate. The loss of activity with indophenyl acetate, a poor substrate, is preceded by an increase in enzyme activity. Only 12 of the 21 tyrosine residues/monomer of enzyme are susceptible to nitration. Loss of activity with respect to indophenyl acetate occurs well after no further nitration of tyrosines occurs and must be due to the modification of other residues. Incubation of the enzyme with arsenite before nitration results in the nitration of only 10 tyrosines. This experiment reveals that the structural basis for the binding of arsenite is the formation of a diester with two tyrosine residues."

The dissociation constants are 25 nM and 13 microM, respectively. Direct comparisons between spectroscopic and enzymatic properties of the two enzymesterol complexes and the 22-amino-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3 beta-ol complex are made, underlining the importance of the stereochemistry at the C-22 position."

https://openalex.org/W1546898579,"The 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase from calf thymus has been purified and characterized. Two species of Mr = 42,000 and 27,000 +/- 5% and Stokes radius of 27.5 and 22.4 A, respectively, were found. Only the lower molecular weight species were present in the nucleus; it was bound to chromatin and could be dissociated in the presence of 0.25 M KCl. The enzymatic properties of the two species appeared to be identical. Both enzyme species released 3-methyladenine, 7-methylguanine, and 3-methylguanine, listed in the order of decreasing activity. The chromatin-associated enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity and found to be a basic protein having a pI greater than 9. It was completely inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, but this inhibition could be fully reversed by addition of excess 2-mercaptoethanol. Kinetic studies, heat inactivation, and inhibition experiments demonstrated that the 3-methyladenine and 7-methylguanine releasing activities were located on the same protein molecule. The enzymes showed no activity on methylated single-stranded DNA. No product inhibition was observed for any of the enzyme species, and the enzyme activity was optimal when the incubation was performed in the presence of 50 mM NaCl or KCl at pH values between 8 and 9."
https://openalex.org/W2008983317,"Localized inflammation of the lungs was induced with the neutrophil chemoattractant, N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (FMLP) in combination with magnetically responsive albumin microspheres, a drug carrier that provides efficient, extremely rapid localization in tissue. Intravenous targeting to rat lungs was accomplished by means of an external thoracic magnet. This caused progressive local accumulation of neutrophils, extravascular cell migration, and acute tissue injury. Microscopic findings favored chemotaxis as the principal mechanism of cell accumulation. This system provides a new experimental model for acute alveolar damage, a rapid in vivo assay for drugs that modulate neutrophil chemotaxis, and a new therapeutic approach to focusing inflammation in patients with chemotactic defects."
https://openalex.org/W1512759847,"The mechanism of ATP hydrolysis in myofibrils can be studied by following the time course of tryptophan fluorescence. Stoichiometric quantities of ATP produce an enhancement of the tryptophan fluorescence in stirred suspensions of rabbit psoas myofibrils at pCa greater than 7. Approximately 1 mol of ATP/myosin head is required to obtain the maximum fluorescence enhancement of 4-6%. Upon the addition of quantities of ATP greater than 1 mol/mol of myosin head, the fluorescence rapidly increases to a steady state, which lasts for a period that is proportional to the amount of ATP added. The fluorescence then decays to the initial level with a half-time of approximately 40 s at 20 degrees C. Hydrolysis of [gamma-32P]ATP at pCa greater than 7 in myofibrils has an initial burst of approximately 0.7 mol/mol of myosin head that is followed by a constant rate of hydrolysis. The duration of the steady state hydrolysis is identical to the duration of the enhancement of tryptophan fluorescence. A lower limit of 5 X 10(5) M-1 S-1 was obtained for the second order rate constant of the fluorescence enhancement by ATP. At pCa of 4, the duration of the fluorescence enhancement is one-tenth to one-twentieth as long as at pCa greater than 7; this is consistent with the increased steady state rate of ATP hydrolysis at higher calcium concentrations. The time course of the fluorescence enhancement observed in myofibrils during ATP hydrolysis is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that observed with actomyosin-S1 in solution. These results suggest that the kinetic mechanism of ATP hydrolysis that has been well established by studies of actomyosin-S1 in solution also occurs in myofibrils."
https://openalex.org/W1523265045,"The acyl protein synthetase component (50K) of the fatty acid reductase complex from the luminescent system of Photobacterium phosphoreum has been found to catalyze the activation of fatty acid via formation of an enzyme bound acyl-AMP (carboxyphosphate mixed anhydride) immediately prior to the acylation of the enzyme. PPi-ATP exchange and nucleotide binding experiments are dependent on fatty acid and indicate that the fatty acyl-AMP is directly formed and that an adenylated enzyme intermediate is not part of the mechanism. The formation of acyl-AMP from fatty acid and ATP is reversible with a standard free energy of -2 kcal/mol, and is dependent on Mg2+. The fatty acyl-AMP intermediate has been isolated and shown to be part of the pathway of fatty acid reduction. The 34K component of the complex, which strongly stimulates the acylation of the 50K protein by fatty acyl-AMP or fatty acid and ATP, is not required for the formation of acyl-AMP showing that it differentially affects the fatty acid activation and acylation steps catalyzed by the 50K protein."
https://openalex.org/W1548982714,"Purified single-chain human coagulation factor V (Mr approximately 330,000) was visualized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The molecule was found to be composed of four major domains. Three similar sized (approximately 90 X 70 A) globular domains were linked via thin (approximately 30 A) spacers to a somewhat larger (approximately 165 X 138 A) central domain. The center-to-center distances between the larger central domain and each of the peripheral domains were found to be approximately 120 A. Incubation of factor V with thrombin resulted in a separation of the peripheral domains from the central domain. This indicates that the factor V domains now observed correspond to the previously characterized factor V fragments formed by limited proteolysis using thrombin. From these results, a model of the three-dimensional factor V structure, distinct from previous models, is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1519884615,"Abstract 4-Aminobutyrate aminotransferase is inactivated by preincubation with N-(1-pyrene)maleimide (mixing molar ratio 10:1) at pH 7. The reaction with N-(1-pyrene)maleimide was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy and the degree of labeling of the enzyme determined by absorption spectroscopy. The blocking of 2 cysteinyl residues/enzyme dimer is needed for inactivation of the aminotransferase. The time course of the reaction is significantly affected by the substrate alpha-ketoglutarate, which afforded complete protection against the loss of catalytic activity. Trypsin digestion of pyrene-labeled aminotransferase, followed by gel filtration and fingerprint analysis, revealed the presence of only one peptide tagged with the fluorescent probe. The reaction of approximately 1.9 SH residues/dimer with iodosobenzoate resulted in enzyme inactivation together with a formation of an oligomeric species of Mr = 100,000 detectable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The cross-linked subunits are dissociated by addition of 2-mercaptoethanol which also restores full catalytic activity. Altogether, these observations are consistent with the concept that inactivation of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase by iodosobenzoate proceeds through disulfide bond formation between vicinal cysteinyl residues of the protein. It is postulated that the critical sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme are situated on opposite sides of the dimeric structure at the subunit interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1555843065,"Treatment of S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioester hydrolase from the uropygial gland of Peking duck with pyrenebutylmethanephosphonofluoridate resulted in inactivation of the enzyme with covalent attachment of the pyrene derivative to the enzyme. One mole of the derivative was attached/mol of protein, most probably at the active serine. When avian fatty acid synthase was added to the modified thioesterase, the fluorescence anisotropy of the pyrene derivative increased dramatically. That this increase represented the functionally significant binding between the two proteins was suggested by the fact that increasing salt concentration resulted in concomitant loss in enzyme activity and fluorescence anisotropy. As the synthase concentration increased, anisotropy increased giving a saturation pattern. From a Scatchard plot analysis the association constant for the binding of the two proteins was calculated to be 10(6) M-1 and one-to-one stoichiometry was shown for this association. These results show that fluorescence anisotropy of the pyrene derivative attached to the thioesterase can be used to directly measure the binding of this enzyme to fatty acid synthase."
