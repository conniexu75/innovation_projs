https://openalex.org/W2042119456,"Histone H2AX is a ubiquitous member of the H2A histone family that differs from the other H2A histones by the presence of an evolutionarily conserved C-terminal motif, -KKATQASQEY. The serine residue in this motif becomes rapidly phosphorylated in cells and animals when DNA double-stranded breaks are introduced into their chromatin by various physical and chemical means. In the present communication we show that this phosphorylated form of H2AX, referred to as γ-H2AX, appears during apoptosis concurrently with the initial appearance of high molecular weight DNA fragments. γ-H2AX forms before the appearance of internucleosomal DNA fragments and the externalization of phosphatidylserine to the outer membrane leaflet. γ-H2AX formation is inhibited byN-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone and the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase, and it is induced when DNase I and restriction enzymes are introduced into cells, suggesting that any apoptotic endonuclease is sufficient to induce γ-H2AX formation. These results indicate that γ-H2AX formation is an early chromatin modification following initiation of DNA fragmentation during apoptosis.

Typical apoptosis is distinguished from necrosis as the former involves the activation of specific pathways that result in characteristic morphological features including DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, cytoplasmic and nuclear pycnosis, and the formation of apoptotic bodies (1.Kerr J.F.R.

Although many stimuli can trigger various pathways to apoptosis, all these pathways converge to a common process involving the activation of a cascade of highly homologous endopeptidases, named caspases, that specifically cleave substrates at aspartic acid residues (5.Salvesen G.S.

Subsequently, the activated execution caspases (e.g. caspase-3, -6, and -7) cleave other polypeptide substrates including lamin (6.Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Although the significance of these cleavages in apoptosis is not fully understood, it seems that execution caspases exert their roles either by blocking pathways that might interfere with the apoptotic program or by activating pathways that advance the program (14.Wyllie A. Nature. 1998; 391: 20-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Whereas caspase activation follows a decision-making step, where the Bcl-2 family members seem to play a crucial role (15.Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar), activated caspases can also be controlled by endogenous inhibitors (16.Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). These factors attest to the complex organization and tight control of the apoptotic program. A caspase-activated DNase (CAD)1 and its inhibitor (ICAD) have been identified in mouse lymphoma cells, whereas in human cells DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) has been identified as a heterodimer of 40- (DFF40) and 45-kDa subunits (17.Liu X.

Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). DFF40 has been shown to induce chromatin condensation and formation of apoptotic bodies in isolated nuclei (20.Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Although chromatin changes are a hallmark of apoptosis, little is known about the specific events and mechanisms involved in this process. H2AX is a member of the H2A histone family, which includes three distinct subfamilies as follows: H2A1-H2A2, H2AZ, and H2AX (21.West M.H.P. Bonner W.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3238-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Each H2A member occupies an analogous position in different nucleosomes, an attribute leading to considerable nucleosomal diversity. Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that histone H2AX becomes phosphorylated on serine residue 139 in the unique C-terminal motif SQEY within seconds after the induction of DNA double-strand breaks in mammalian cells and tissues (22.Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar). The rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks is essential if a cell is to remain capable of proliferation. However, during apoptosis a cell is rendered not only incapable of proliferation but is fragmented into apoptotic bodies to be reabsorbed by the organism. We examined whether H2AX is phosphorylated on serine residue 139 (a form referred to as γ-H2AX) as a result of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. We demonstrate that γ-H2AX formation is a cellular response to endonuclease-mediated DNA fragmentation downstream from caspase activation during apoptosis. The HL60 cell line was a gift from Dr. T. Breitman (NCI). The Jurkat and MCF7 cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The NCI/ADR-RES cell line, formerly known as MCF7/adr, was obtained from the DTP Human Tumor Cell Line Screen (Developmental Therapeutics Program, NCI). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. For Jurkat cell cultures, apoptosis was induced by addition of 0.5 μg/ml of a mouse monoclonal activating antibody to human FAS (IgM, CH-11, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), 0.5 μm staurosporine (Sigma), or 50 μm etoposide (Calbiochem). For HL60 cells, apoptosis was induced with 0.5 μm staurosporine or 10 mmEGTA. For NCI/ADR-RES and MCF7 cells, apoptosis and cell death was induced with 1 μm 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) (Kyowa Hakko Co., Tokyo, Japan). For measurements of MCF7 and NCI/ADR-RES cell viability, 300 cells were seeded in triplicate in T25 flasks and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were then incubated with 1 μm UCN-01 for 24 h. After extensive washing, growth was continued for 10–14 days. Colonies were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.05% methylene blue, and counted. Suspension cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 0 °C at 1,000 ×g for 20 min. Attached cultures were scraped and pelleted as described above. The pellets were washed twice in PBS and histones were extracted in 3 volumes of 0.5 n HCl for 30 min on ice. Histones were subjected to high resolution gel electrophoresis (23.Bonner W.M. West M.H.P. Stedman J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and quantitative analysis was performed as described in Rogakouet al. (22.Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar). Briefly, the acid extracts were prepared and loaded onto 8 m urea, 10% first dimension acetic acid/urea/Triton X-100 (AUT) gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The regions of interest of the first dimension gels were excised and subjected to electrophoresis in second dimension acetic acid/urea/cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (AUC) gels. Images of the H2A region of the Coomassie Blue R-250-stained two-dimensional gels were imaged as TIF files in an EagleEye II gel documentation system with Eaglesight software (version 3.2, Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). The γ-H2AX and unmodified H2AX spots were quantitated with ImageQuant software (version 2, Molecular Dynamics Corp., San Diego, CA). The amount of γ-H2AX is expressed as its percentage of total H2AX. DNA fragmentation was assayed by three methods. For nucleosomal ladders, the phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol procedure was used to extract DNA from aliquots of cell lysates (5 × 106 cells per sample) that had been digested with proteinase K. The DNA was ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer, incubated with RNase A (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then subjected to analysis by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels. For quantitative studies, DNA filter elution analysis was performed as described in Bertrand et al. (24.Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Solary E. Pommier Y. Drug Dev. Res. 1995; 34: 138-144Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing cells were labeled with [methyl-14C]thymidine (58.6 μCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) at 0.02 μCi/ml for 24–30 h. After an overnight chase, the cells were harvested, loaded onto Metricel filters (0.8 μm pore size, Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI), washed with 0.02m EDTA, and lysed with LS-10 buffer (0.2% sodium Sarkosyl, 2 m NaCl, 0.04 m EDTA, pH 10.0). The wash and lysis fractions were allowed to drip through the filters into scintillation vials. The filters were placed in scintillation vials, and the DNA was solubilized in 1 n HCl at 65 °C. After measuring the radioactivity in each sample, DNA fragmentation was determined as the percentage of dpm in the lysis and wash fractions (fragmented DNA) divided by the total dpm (total DNA). The background fragmentation was subtracted in order to compare the results of different experiments. In order to determine the timing of the initial large size fragmentation of DNA during apoptosis, aliquots of Jurkat cell cultures were taken at various times after addition of anti-Fas and subjected to pulse-field gel analysis according to standard protocols. Briefly, cells were embedded in agarose plugs and digested with proteinase K. The plugs were placed in the wells of a long 0.8% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE. Electrophoresis was ramped for 144 h at 60 V from 600 to 3600 s in a CHEF II apparatus (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and imaged with the EagleEye II (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). DNA breaks in single cells were detected using the TUNEL assay (APO-BRDUTM kit, PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Subsequently, samples were processed through a fluorescent-activated cell analyzer, using the Cell Quest software (version 1.2, FACScan, Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). 105–106 Jurkat cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 20 °C and washed with 0.5 ml of cold PBS. Phosphatidylserine externalization to the outer cell membrane leaflet was assayed with annexin-V (TACSTM Annexin-V FITC Kit, Trevigen). Cell suspensions were subsequently processed using the FACScan as described above. pEF-mICAD-Ldm, which carries FLAG-tagged caspase-resistant mouse ICAD-L in a mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS (18.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyamma H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar, 19.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. S. Nagata. pEF-mICAD-Ldm was transiently transfected into Jurkat cells with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flag epitope was detected under confocal microscope (Nikon eclipse TE300, PCM 2000) with anti-Flag antibody (clone M2, Eastman Kodak Co.). Electroporation was performed as described (25.Morgan W.F. Day J.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 48: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in electroporation buffer at a concentration of 6.5 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots containing 0.8 ml of the cell suspension were transferred to electroporation cuvettes (0.4-cm electrode gap). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), RNase-free DNase I (final concentrations of 125 or 375 units/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), AluI, and Sau3AI (final concentrations of 30 units/ml, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) were added to the cell samples that were subjected to electroporation with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) set at 0.3 kV and 125 microfarads. After electroporation, cells were incubated in complete RPMI 1640 for 20 min at 37 °C. Each sample was then split into 2 aliquots for parallel γ-H2AX analysis by gel electrophoresis and DNA break analysis by the TUNEL assay as described above. Our laboratory recently reported that H2AX becomes phosphorylated on serine 139 when double-strand breaks are introduced into the DNA of cells exposed to a variety of environmental and exogenous agents (22.Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar). These DNA-damaging agents include ionizing radiation, radiomimetic compounds, and 365 nm light when the cellular DNA contains bromodeoxyuridine (22.Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar). Since chromatin fragmentation involving DNA double-stranded break formation is a hallmark of apoptosis, we examined whether H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139, termed γ-H2AX, was formed in several cell lines undergoing apoptosis in response to a variety of inducers including some that do not interact with DNA (Fig. 1). Jurkat cells, derived from a human acute T cell leukemia, undergoes apoptosis upon incubation with a variety of chemical and biological agents (Fig. 1,A–D). The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, a general and highly effective apoptotic inducer (26.Shao R.-G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27.Bertrand R. Solary E. Kohn K.W. O'Connor P.O. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), also induced γ-H2AX formation (Fig. 1 B). Thus, staurosporine apparently does not inhibit the kinase responsible for γ-H2AX formation during apoptosis. Etoposide (VP-16), a specific inhibitor of topoisomerase II, was also found to induce γ-H2AX during apoptosis in Jurkat cells (Fig.1 C). Jurkat plasma membranes contain Fas receptors that become aggregated when the cells are exposed to the appropriate antibody (28.Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). The antibody acts similarly to an endogenously formed apoptotic inducer, Fas ligand. Thus this system mimics biologically programmed initiation of apoptosis (31.Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar, 32.Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugal T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar, 33.Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Mattmann C. Scuderi P. Terskikh A. Peitsch M.C. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18827-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). γ-H2AX was formed when Jurkat cell cultures were incubated with anti-Fas (Fig. 1 D), and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was formed in Jurkat cells in response to the three apoptotic inducers (Fig. 1, B–D, insets). HL60 is a human leukemia cell line that also easily undergoes apoptosis upon incubation with a variety of chemical agents (29.Solary E. Bertrand R. Pommier Y. Leuk. & Lymphoma. 1994; 15: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As with Jurkat cells, staurosporine induced the formation of both γ-H2AX and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HL60 cells (Fig. 1 F, main panel and inset). EGTA, a chelating agent of divalent cations, particularly Ca+2, also induced both DNA fragmentation and γ-H2AX formation (Fig. 1 G, main panel and inset). Whereas many types of endonuclease activities require divalent cations in vitro, DNA fragmentation does take place in HL60 cells in EGTA-containing medium. In contrast to the Jurkat and HL60 cell lines that grow in suspension, NCI/ADR-RES is an attached human breast carcinoma line that undergoes apoptosis when incubated with 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), a clinical derivative of staurosporine (30.Nieves-Neira W. Pommier Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The DNA of NCI/ADR-RES cells does become fragmented during apoptosis but not extensively enough to form internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (30.Nieves-Neira W. Pommier Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). γ-H2AX was found in NCI/ADR-RES cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 1, H andI). Thus, the results obtained with three cell lines and five inducers of apoptosis indicate that the appearance of γ-H2AX is a general characteristic of apoptosis. The demonstration that γ-H2AX formation was detectable in several cell lines during apoptosis (Fig. 1) prompted a more detailed examination to determine the timing of γ-H2AX formation. Since the formation of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation is a late event in apoptotic progression, resulting from digestion of large DNA fragments formed earlier in apoptosis (34.Bicknell G.R. Snowden R.T. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Walker R.P. Sikorska M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the filter elution procedure (24.Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Solary E. Pommier Y. Drug Dev. Res. 1995; 34: 138-144Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was utilized to detect large double-stranded DNA fragments in a quantitative manner. DNA analysis by filter elution was coupled with histone gel analysis to examine Jurkat cell cultures incubated for various times in the presence of anti-Fas (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3,A and B). γ-H2AX was not detectable in the control culture or in the treated culture at 0.5 h (Fig. 2,A and B) and was at the limit of detection at 1 h (Fig. 2 C). However, γ-H2AX was clearly detectable at 1.5 h (Fig. 2 D) and increased further until 3 h (Fig. 2, E–G). The amount of γ-H2AX then declined somewhat but remained at significant levels even at 8 h (Fig.2 I). When γ-H2AX formation was quantified (Fig.3 A) and compared with DNA fragmentation measured by neutral filter elution in parallel samples (Fig. 3 B), the former appeared abruptly at 1.5 h while γ-H2AX increased gradually and became substantially above background after 1.5 h.Figure 3Kinetics of γ-H2AX formation compared with DNA fragmentation during apoptosis.γ-H2AX formation (A and C) and DNA fragmentation (B and D) were quantitated using filter elution analysis for the latter (“Experimental Procedures”).A and B, Jurkat cell cultures incubated with 0.5 μg/ml anti-Fas for the times indicated. C andD, NCI/ADR-RES (solid lines) and MCF7 (dotted lines) cell cultures incubated with 1 μm UCN-01 for the times indicated. Each data point represents the average of three determinations; error barsindicate the standard deviation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results suggested γ-H2AX to be a sensitive and early indicator of the double-stranded DNA fragmentation that occurs during apoptosis. Similar studies were performed with NCI/ADR-RES cells, a human breast carcinoma cell line that undergoes apoptosis more slowly than Jurkat or HL60 cells when incubated with UCN-01 (29.Solary E. Bertrand R. Pommier Y. Leuk. & Lymphoma. 1994; 15: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In these cells, γ-H2AX was found in substantial amounts by 8 h (Fig. 3 C), while DNA fragmentation was not detected until after 8 h (Fig.3 D). These data show that, irrespective of the different stimuli and different apoptosis initiation events, γ-H2AX appears early during apoptosis concurrently with small levels of initial double-stranded breakage of the genomic DNA. In contrast to NCI/ADR-RES, MCF7, another breast carcinoma from the NCI Anticancer Drug Screen, undergoes cell death without exhibiting the typical apoptotic phenotype (30.Nieves-Neira W. Pommier Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). 2W. Nieves-Neira and Y. Pommier, unpublished observations. This difference is possibly because MCF7 cells lack caspase-3 (37.Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), an enzyme known to activate downstream apoptotic events including DNA fragmentation. In the presence of 1 μm UCN-01, both the MCF7 and the NCI/ADR-RES cell lines had greatly decreased clonogenic survival values, 2% for MCF7 and 8% for NCI/ADR-RES. These results indicated that cell death had occurred in both lines to similar extents. However, the MCF7 cells, when incubated with UCN-01, exhibited neither DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3 D) nor γ-H2AX formation (Fig.3 C). This observation indicates that γ-H2AX formation is observed in dying cells only if and when their DNA is fragmented. As shown above (Fig. 2 D), γ-H2AX is present in substantial amounts in Jurkat cultures 1.5 h after addition of anti-Fas. Changes in the plasma membranes of cells are also known to occur early in apoptosis. One of these changes, externalization of phosphatidylserine to the outer plasma membrane, can be assayed by annexin-V binding (38.Naito M. Nagashima K. Mashima T. Tsuruo T. Blood. 1997; 89: 2060-2066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry for the externalization of phosphatidylserine, the major increase in the number of cells capable of binding annexin-V was apparent after 3 h incubation with anti-Fas, although smaller increases were apparent at 2 and 2.5 h (Fig. 4). However, since γ-H2AX was already present in substantial amounts at 1.5 h (Figs.2 D and 3 A), these results demonstrate that γ-H2AX is formed in the chromatin before phosphatidylserine externalization is detectable in the outer plasma membrane of apoptotic cells. DNA fragmentation during apoptosis is the result of an endonuclease that becomes activated by caspase action (17.Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 18.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyamma H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation can be inhibited by incubating cultures withN-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (ZVAD), a peptide that inhibits caspase activity (39.Dolle R.E. Hoyer D.

When Jurkat cell cultures were incubated for 3 or 8 h with anti-Fas in the continuous presence or absence of ZVAD, the ZVAD-containing cultures exhibited background levels of DNA fragmentation and no detectable γ-H2AX formation (Fig. 5, Aand B). Similarly, NCI/ADR-RES cultures, when incubated with 1 μm UCN-01 plus 50 μm ZVAD for 12 or 24 h, exhibited only background levels for both DNA fragmentation and γ-H2AX formation (Fig. 5, C and D). 10 μm ZVAD, which only partially inhibited DNA fragmentation in this system, also only partially inhibited γ-H2AX formation (data not shown). These results suggest that γ-H2AX formation during apoptosis is a downstream consequence of caspase activation. The initial DNA fragments formed during apoptosis are in the size range 0.3–2.0 Mbp (34.Bicknell G.R. Snowden R.T. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Walker R.P. Sikorska M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In order to determine when γ-H2AX appears relative to the 0.3–2.0-Mbp DNA fragmentation, aliquots from Jurkat cell cultures undergoing apoptosis with anti-Fas were subjected to pulse-field electrophoretic analysis (Fig.6). The 0.3–2.0-Mbp DNA fragments appear in substantial amounts 1.5 h after the addition of anti-Fas; with longer times, more DNA material is seen at progressively shorter lengths. Whereas the apoptotic samples on the pulse-field gel contained increasing amounts of DNA fragments as large as 2.0 Mbp, there was no detectable amount of DNA in the 3–6- Mbp region, even in the samples taken at 0.5 and 1 h. This observation substantiates that the 0.3–2.0-Mbp fragments may be the initial fragments cleaved from intact chromatin during apoptosis (34.Bicknell G.R. Snowden R.T. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Walker R.P. Sikorska M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The presence of ZVAD in the cultures prevented the formation of DNA fragments of any size (Fig. 6). Thus, these findings indicate that γ-H2AX is formed concurrently with the initiation of DNA double-stranded breaks resulting from the apoptotic endonuclease activation. Caspases are known to trigger multiple pathways that result in the global apoptotic phenotype. One major pathway involves the activation of CAD/DFF40, which leads to DNA fragmentation and apparently to chromatin condensation (17.Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). mICAD was transiently transfected into Jurkat cells (Fig. 7). Nineteen hours after transfection, transfectants and mock transfectants were treated with 1 μm staurosporine for 3 h. γ-H2AX formation was inhibited when mICAD was overexpressed (Fig. 7, A andB). The extent of inhibition was similar to the fraction of the cells found to express the FLAG epitope of the recombinant ICAD. Yet, the possibility that other apoptotic"

In some systems, GPCRs stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation by inducing the “transactivation” of a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). The mechanisms underlying GPCR-induced RTK transactivation have not been clearly defined. Here we report that GPCR activation mimics growth factor-mediated stimulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with respect to many facets of RTK function. β2-Adrenergic receptor (β2AR) stimulation of COS-7 cells induces EGFR dimerization, tyrosine autophosphorylation, and EGFR internalization. Coincident with EGFR transactivation, isoproterenol exposure induces the formation of a multireceptor complex containing both the β2AR and the “transactivated” EGFR. β2AR-mediated EGFR phosphorylation and subsequent β2AR stimulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 are sensitive to selective inhibitors of both EGFR and Src kinases, indicating that both kinases are required for EGFR transactivation. β2AR-dependent signaling to ERK1/2, like direct EGF stimulation of ERK1/2 activity, is sensitive to inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, suggesting that signaling downstream of both the EGF-activated and the GPCR-transactivated EGFRs requires a productive engagement of the complex with the cellular endocytic machinery. Thus, RTK transactivation is revealed to be a process involving both association of receptors of distinct classes and the interaction of the transactivated RTK with the cells endocytic machinery.

Such short term regulation of intermediary metabolism by GPCRs appears distinct from the long term proliferative or differentiative effects of growth factor receptor stimulation. This distinction has been blurred, however, by the demonstration that many GPCRs induce the activation of mitogenic signaling cascades classically associated with receptors for growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) or platelet-derived growth factor. In many cell types, activation of GPCRs stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades that mediate cell growth or proliferation through transcriptional regulation (1.van Biesen T.

Ras-dependent activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAP kinase cascade by RTKs such as the EGFR follows a series of well defined events. Binding of ligand to the monomeric EGFR induces EGFR dimerization, activation of intrinsic EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, and transphosphorylation of the dimerized EGFR monomers (3.Yarden Y. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1443-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This tyrosine phosphorylation creates docking sites for adapter proteins that possess Src homology 2 domains such as Gab-1, Shc, and Grb2. Src homology 2 domain-mediated recruitment of the Grb2-associated Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, mSos, allows the formation of a complex that activates small G proteins, such as Ras. Recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex induces Ras turnover and initiates the multi-enzyme ERK signaling cascade (4.Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Recently, Vieiraet al. (5.Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Google Scholar) have found that EGFR-stimulated ERK activation is sensitive to a dominant inhibitory mutant of dynamin, suggesting that either endocytosis of the EGFR itself or targeting of the receptor to clathrin-coated vesicles is also required for efficient Ras-dependent ERK activation. In many systems the early convergence of growth regulatory signals originating from GPCRs and RTKs reflects GPCR-mediated “transactivation” of an RTK. RTK transactivation is associated with increased tyrosine autophosphorylation and dimerization of EGFR or platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and association of these receptors with the tyrosine-phosphorylated adapters, Shc, Gab1, and Grb2-Sos (6.Luttrell L.M.

Little is known, however, about the mechanisms whereby the activated GPCR and its dissociated G protein regulate RTK activity.

Subsequent activation of the ERK cascade by β2ARs is dependent upon Gβγ subunits derived from Bordetella pertussis (PTX) toxin-sensitive G proteins acting upon unknown effectors. In the present study, we have examined the mechanism of β2AR-mediated transactivation of the EGFR. We find that stimulation of the β2AR induces the formation of a multi-receptor complex containing both the β2AR and EGFR. Subsequent β2AR-mediated EGFR transactivation and ERK1/2 stimulation requires both EGFR and Src kinase activity. As with EGF-stimulated ERK activation (5.Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Google Scholar), β2AR-mediated ERK1/2 activation is sensitive to inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, consistent with a role for the endocytic machinery in activation of the ERK cascade by “transactivated” as well as by ligand-activated EGFRs. The EGF receptor-specific inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478, the Src kinase-specific inhibitors 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo-d-3,4-pyrimidine (PP1), 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2), and herbimycin A, epidermal growth factor (EGF), Ro-31-8220, and cytochalasin D were obtained from Calbiochem. PP1 and PP2 were employed interchangeably in our assays and demonstrated indistinguishable potency and specificity in our hands (data not shown). B. pertussis toxin was from List Biologicals. ICI-118,551 was obtained from RBI. Isoproterenol, monodansylcadaverine (MDC), 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM), and M2 anti-Flag affinity agarose were obtained from Sigma. The cDNA encoding β-arrestin 1(319–418) was a gift of J. Benovic. The cDNA encoding the EGFR-GFP chimera was a gift of A. Sorkin. The cDNA constructs for c-Src and HA-ERK1 were generously provided by D. Fujita and J. Pouyssegur, respectively. COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin (10,000 units/ml)/streptomycin (10,000 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (6.Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Prior to stimulation, appropriately transfected COS-7 cells at 80% confluence were incubated in serum-free media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 16 h. Agonist stimulations were performed at 37 °C in serum-free media following pre-incubation with inhibitors as described in the figure legends. Dimerization of the monomeric EGFR was determined following covalent cross-linking using the water soluble, non-hydrolyzable cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Stimulation of cell monolayers was performed in 4.6 ml/100-mm plate of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) supplemented with 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. Following agonist exposure, 400 μl of a 25 mm BS3 solution (in Me2SO) was added to the monolayers to generate a final concentration of 2 mm. Monolayers were then rocked gently at 5 °C for 30 min. After cross-linking, monolayers were placed on ice and washed three times with ice-cold DPBS containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and once with ice-cold DPBS. Monolayers were then lysed in Nonidet P-40 solubilization buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of EGFRs were performed as described. After stimulation, cell monolayers were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold DPBS, and lysed in the Nonidet P-40 solubilization buffer. Solubilized lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min and diluted to an approximate concentration of 1 mg/ml. Where appropriate, a 50-μl aliquot of clarified whole-cell lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for confirmation of plasmid expression or determination of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by protein immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation of the Flag-tagged β2AR (Fβ2AR) was achieved using 25 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-Flag epitope M2 affinity agarose (Sigma) with agitation for 16 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of the endogenous COS-7 cell EGFR was performed using 5 μg of sheep anti-human EGFR polyclonal IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) plus 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G plus/protein A-agarose (Calbiochem) with agitation for 16 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times with ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer and transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube before addition of 25–50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane for protein immunoblotting. PVDF membranes were blocked in a 4% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 blocking solution. Immunoblotting of endogenous EGFR was performed using sheep anti-human EGFR polyclonal IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1:1000 dilution with a 1:1000 dilution of HRP-conjugated polyclonal anti-sheep IgG as secondary antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Flag epitope-tagged β2AR protein was detected by a 1:500 dilution of anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) using a 1:5000 dilution of HRP-conjugated monoclonal anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunochemicals) as secondary antibody. β-Arrestin 1 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal IgG directed against the arrestin carboxyl terminus (20.Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG as a secondary antibody. c-Src was detected with anti-Src rabbit polyclonal IgG (Src2; Santa Cruz) using an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG as the secondary antibody. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by a 1:1000 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20H (Transduction Laboratories). Visualization of HRP-labeled proteins was performed using enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified by scanning laser densitometry. To determine ERK1/2 phosphorylation from whole cell lysates, agonist was removed by aspiration, monolayers were washed once with room temperature DPBS, lysed in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane. Immunoprecipitation of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ERK1 was performed using 20 μl of anti-HA affinity agarose (BAbCo) with agitation for 4 h at 4 °C. Phosphorylation of endogenous ERK1/2 from whole-cell extracts or immunoprecipitated HA-ERK1 was detected with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-phospho-specific MAP kinase polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs). Identical PVDF filters were immunoblotted in parallel for total amount of ERK1/2 present using a 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). HRP-conjugated IgG (Jackson Immunochemicals) was employed as a secondary antibody for both phospho- and total ERK1/2. Subsequent quantitation of phospho-ERK1/2 immunoblots was normalized to the total amount of ERK1/2 present. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope using a Zeiss 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture water immersion lens. COS-7 cells expressing HA epitope-tagged β2ARs (HAβ2AR) and an EGFR-green fluorescent protein (EGFR-GFP) chimera were grown on 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes (Nunclon). Where appropriate, HAβ2ARs were stained using a 1:100 dilution of anti-HA rhodamine-conjugated monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 37 °C in serum-free media. Cell monolayers were subsequently stimulated for 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice in room temperature DPBS, and fixed by the addition of 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS. The subcellular distribution of EGFR-GFP constructs was detected using single-line excitation at 488 nm. Colocalization studies of the EGFR-GFP and rhodamine-labeled HAβ2AR were performed using dual line switching excitation (488 nm for GFP, 568 nm for rhodamine) and emission (515–540 nm GFP, 590–610 nm rhodamine) filter sets. Serum-starved COS-7 monolayers expressing Fβ2AR were incubated with 10 μmisoproterenol in 0.1 mm ascorbate for 30 min. The agonist-promoted sequestration of β2ARs was determined as the loss of cell surface receptors measured by immunofluorescence flow cytometry as described previously (21.Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, stimulation of serum-starved COS-7 cells with either isoproterenol or EGF increased phosphorylation of the endogenous p42 (ERK2)/p44 (ERK1) ERKs. While each ligand produced a maximal response within 3–5 min of stimulation, the maximal EGF response exceeded the maximal isoproterenol response by 2–3-fold. As expected, the isoproterenol- but not the EGF-induced signal was inhibited by the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. In contrast, both signals were sensitive to the specific EGFR kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478 (AG1478), suggesting that EGFR kinase activity is required for β2AR activation of the ERK cascade. The specific Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 also caused a significant reduction of the isoproterenol-mediated ERK activation while having no significant effect upon EGF-mediated ERK activation (Fig.1 A). As previously reported (18.Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), the β2AR signal, but not the EGF signal, was inhibited by both PTX and by transient overexpression of the Gβγ subunit binding carboxyl terminus of βARK-1 (βARK1-CT), indicating that the β2AR signal is dependent upon the presence of Gβγ subunits from PTX-sensitive G proteins (Fig. 1 B). In COS-7 cells neither β2AR nor EGFR-stimulated ERK phosphorylation was significantly affected by Ca2+chelation or by inhibition of classical and novel PKC isoforms (Fig.1 C). Neither the cell permeant calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, nor the PKC inhibitor, Ro-31-8220, had any significant effect upon isoproterenol- or EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation. Pre-treatment of cells with cytochalasin D (1 μm), which inhibits focal adhesion-based signaling by depolymerizing the actin cytoskeleton, also had no significant effect upon either isoproterenol- or EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that calcium or PKC-dependent activation of focal adhesion kinases such as the calcium-regulated, focal adhesion kinase family kinase, Pyk2 (10.Dikic I. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14301-14308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), does not contribute significantly to β2AR-stimulated ERK activation in these cells. The inhibition of both β2AR- and EGF-stimulated ERK activation by the EGFR-specific tyrphostin, AG1478, suggests that the isoproterenol- and EGF-induced signals converge upon the EGFR. To determine whether β2AR activation results in activation of the EGFR, we assessed EGFR dimerization, phosphorylation, and internalization in response to β2AR stimulation. Both monomeric (p180) and covalently cross-linked dimeric (p360) forms of the EGFR were resolved by SDS-PAGE following stimulation and cross-linking with the water-soluble, non-hydrolyzable covalent cross-linker BS3. As shown in Fig.2 A, stimulation of COS-7 cells with either isoproterenol or EGF resulted in EGFR dimerization. To assay the effects of β2AR stimulation upon EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, EGFR immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 2 B, both isoproterenol and EGF stimulation increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. The extent of isoproterenol-driven EGFR dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation was less robust than that mediated by direct EGF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2 C, both isoproterenol- and EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation were abolished by AG1478. Like β2AR-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, β2AR-mediated EGFR phosphorylation was significantly more sensitive to the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 than EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, while the intrinsic catalytic activity of the EGFR is necessary for the tyrosine phosphorylation of both the ligand-activated and the GPCR-transactivated EGFR, the data suggest that Src activity is required for efficient β2AR-mediated EGFR phosphorylation. β2AR-induced internalization of the EGFR was studied in COS-7 cells transiently expressing a chimeric EGFR-GFP, which functions like the wild type EGFR with respect to receptor dimerization and phosphorylation (22.Carter R.E. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopic images of cells expressing the EGFR-GFP construct were obtained from paraformaldehyde-fixed cells following a 30-min stimulation with either isoproterenol or EGF. As shown in Fig. 2 D, unstimulated cells (left panel) typically demonstrated a linear plasma membrane GFP fluorescence with some small amount of nascent EGFR-GFP in a diffuse pattern in the cell interior. Stimulation of cells with EGF (right panel) or to a lesser extent isoproterenol (center panel) caused the coalescence of GFP fluorescence into bright patches, as well as the loss of plasma membrane fluorescence and the appearance of internalized EGFR-GFP, consistent with EGFR endocytosis. Recently, we have reported that the binding of β-arrestins to agonist-occupied β2ARs promotes formation of a multi-protein complex containing the β2AR, β-arrestin, and c-Src (23.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). To determine whether β2AR-mediated EGFR transactivation might reflect a direct protein-protein interaction between the β2AR and the EGFR, immunoprecipitates of Fβ2AR were probed for co-precipitated EGFR. As shown in Fig. 3 A, endogenous EGFR was present in Fβ2AR immunoprecipitates from transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Due to variable glycosylation, the immunoprecipitated Fβ2AR typically migrates on SDS-PAGE as a diffuse band of 40–50 kDa. Isoproterenol stimulation increased both the amount of EGFR in Fβ2AR immunoprecipitates and the phosphotyrosine content of the co-immunoprecipitated EGFR. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the time courses of isoproterenol-stimulated Fβ2AR-EGFR complex formation and EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation paralleled the time course for isoproterenol-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Thus, the assembly of the β2AR-EGFR complex occurs with a time course consistent with a role for this complex in the GPCR-induced activation of ERK1/2. As shown in Fig. 4 A, Fβ2AR immunoprecipitates contained co-precipitated EGFR even in the absence of isoproterenol. This might reflect the presence of pre-formed β2AR-EGFR complexes. Alternatively, transient overexpression of Fβ2AR could be sufficient to increase the number of conformationally active (R*) β2ARs even in the absence of agonist (24.Samama P. Cotecchia S Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in detectable complex formation between EGFR and β2ARs in the R* conformation. To distinguish these alternatives, we assessed the effect of a β2AR inverse agonist, ICI-118,551 (25.Samama P. Pei G. Costa T. Cotecchia S. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 290-294Google Scholar), upon basal complex. ICI-118,551 preferentially binds to β2ARs in the inactive R conformation and competitively inhibits spontaneous transition to the active R* conformation. Thus, a loss of basal β2AR-EGFR complex following ICI 118,551 treatment would suggest that β2AR-EGFR complex formation is driven by conformational activation of the β2AR. As shown in Fig. 4 B, application of ICI-118,551 reduced both basal β2AR-EGFR complex and the phosphotyrosine content of the β2AR-associated EGFR by approximately 60%. This effect of ICI-118,551 was dose-dependent with an IC50 of approximately 1 μm (data not shown) and was reversed by acute application of a 50-fold excess of isoproterenol. Isoproterenol stimulation of ICI-118,551-treated cells markedly increased the phosphotyrosine content of the β2AR-associated EGFR with the maximal effect occurring within 5 min of isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 4 C). ICI-118,551 treatment caused a decrease in basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation that paralleled the decrease in basal β2AR-EGFR complex and that was similarly reversed by the addition of isoproterenol. Supportive of the hypothesis that the basal β2AR-EGFR complexes reflect the existence of a pool of overexpressed Fβ2ARs that are spontaneously in the R* conformation, we found that Fβ2AR overexpression was sufficient to increase basal β2AR-EGFR complex formation and EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4 D, the amount of Fβ2AR in immunoprecipitates of endogenous EGFR increased with Fβ2AR overexpression. In these EGFR immunoprecipitates, EGFR phosphotyrosine content increased in parallel with the formation of the β2AR-EGFR complex, suggesting that formation of the β2AR-EGFR complex triggered EGFR transactivation. We have previously reported that the binding of β-arrestin 1 to c-Src mediates the agonist-dependent recruitment of Src kinases to β-arrestin-bound β2ARs (23.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, isoproterenol stimulation of COS-7 cells expressing Fβ2AR, c-Src, and β-arrestin-1 increased the amount of Fβ2AR-associated EGFR, β-arrestin-1, and c-Src, suggesting that β2AR activation induced the formation of a multi-protein complex containing the Fβ2AR, EGFR, β-arrestin-1, and c-Src. As shown in Fig. 5 B, pre-treatment of the cells with the Src-selective kinase inhibitors PP2 or herbimycin A attenuated both the isoproterenol-induced formation of the β2AR-EGFR complex and isoproterenol-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These data suggest that Src catalytic activity is required for β2AR-EGFR complex assembly, as well as for “downstream” activation of the ERK cascade. Vieira et al. (5.Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Google Scholar) have reported that EGF-stimulated activation of the ERK cascade is selectively impaired by cellular expression of a dominant inhibitory (K44A) mutant of dynamin I. Since β2AR-mediated ERK1/2 activation in COS-7 cells involves EGFR transactivation, a similar sensitivity to inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis might be predicted. To test this hypothesis, three mechanistically distinct inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis were assayed for their effect upon β2AR-mediated ERK activation in COS-7 cells. Cells were transfected with a dominant negative mutant of dynamin I (Y231F/Y597F dynamin I; Ref. 26.Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol.

Loss of the first phase leads to mild glucose intolerance, whereas reduced insulin output is consistent with observed neonatal hyperglycemia.

ATP-sensitive K+ channels sulfonylurea receptor persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy potassium inward rectifier Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATPchannels)1 are a unique combination of a K+ inward rectifier (either KIR6.1 or KIR6.2) and a sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1 or SUR2) transport ATPase superfamily members (1.Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2.Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement IV J.P. Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol.

These channels respond to changes in ATP/ADP and can couple metabolism to membrane electrical activity. SUR1 and KIR6.2 comprise the KATP channels in pancreatic β-cells that regulate the ionic pathway mediating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by setting the resting membrane potential below the activation threshold for voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (4.Cook D.L. Taborsky G.J. Porte D. Sherwin R.S. Elleberg and Rifkin's Diabetes Mellitus. 5th Ed. Appleton and Lange, Stamford, CT1997: 49-73Google Scholar). Mutations in human Sur1 or KIR6.2 cause a recessive form of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) characterized by oversecretion of insulin despite severe hypoglycemia (1.Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 5.Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 336-346Google Scholar). Surprisingly, two recent studies involving disruption of KATP channels in mice produced a quite different picture. Targeted overexpression of a dominant-negative KIR6.2 subunit, KIR6.2G132S, in β-cells reduced channel activity producing animals that were hypoglycemic at birth but became increasingly hyperglycemic secondary to β-cell death (6.Miki T. Tashiro F. Iwanaga T. Nagashima K. Yoshitomi H. Aihara H. Nitta Y. Gonoi T. Inagaki N. Miyazaki J. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11969-11973Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). KIR6.2 null mice, KIR6.2–/–, on the other hand, completely lack β-cell KATP channels but exhibit a less severe phenotype (7.Miki T. Nagashima K. Tashiro F. Kotake K. Yoshitomi H. Tamamoto A. Gonoi T. Iwanaga T. Miyazaki J. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The KIR6.2–/– animals have nearly normal blood glucose levels, showing mild glucose intolerance when challenged with glucose. These animals are reported to release a small amount of insulin in response to glucose, whereas isolated, perifused islets show a small first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and no second phase. The normal blood glucose levels have been attributed to insulin hypersensitivity secondary to the loss of SUR2A/KIR6.2 KATP channels in skeletal muscle. SUR1 null mice, Sur1 –/–, unlike their KIR6.2–/– counterparts, are not insulin-hypersensitive. Isolated Sur1 –/–islets exhibit a pattern of glucose-stimulated insulin release consistent with regulation by an underlying KATP-independent pathway (or pathways), the nature of which is unknown (8.Panten U.

The Sur1 –/– mice are both significantly more hyperglycemic when glucose-loaded and significantly more hypoglycemic when fasted than the control animals. Potential physiologic mechanisms of regulation of blood glucose by KATP-independent insulin secretion are discussed. The 5′-end of the mouseSur1 gene was cloned from a mouse genomic library constructed in λ phage. The approved symbol for the Sur1gene is Abcc8. A targeting vector was constructed that contained 5.5 kilobase pairs of DNA, including the 5′- and 3′-intronic sequence flanking a puromycin resistance cassette that replaced the second exon of Sur1. Thymidine kinase was included downstream of the 3′ region of homology for negative selection. The vector was linearized and used to electroporate RW4 embryonic stem cells (Genome Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Transfected cells were selected with puromycin (3 μg/ml) and 1-(-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil (3.5 nm); colonies were picked after 12 days and screened for targeted disruption by Southern blotting. Correct recombination was verified by polymerase chain reaction from both the 5′- and 3′-ends of the targeted region. Embryonic stem cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts using standard techniques. Chimeric males were selected and crossed with wild type C57BL/6 females to generateSur1 +/– heterozygotes, which were bred to obtain Sur1 +/+, Sur1 +/–, and Sur1 –/– animals. Animals were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed standard rodent chow. Brains from control andSur1 –/– mice were used to isolate membranes as described (13.Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement IV J.P. Nelson D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 732-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Sur1 was identified by photolabeling with [125I]azidoiodoglibenclamide as described previously (14.Clement IV J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Blood glucose levels were measured using Precision Q·I·D glucose sensors (MediSense, Inc., Bedford, MA). Microtainer® serum separator tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were used to extract serum. Plasma insulin was measured with a rat insulin ELISA kit using mouse insulin as a standard (Crystal Chem, Inc., Chicago, IL). Medium insulin was measured using a rat insulin RIA kit (Linco Research, Inc., St. Charles, MO). Fed and fasted tail blood samples were taken from randomly feeding animals or following a 16-h fast. Intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests were done on 12–16-week-old male mice following a 16-h fast. Animals were injected intraperitoneally with glucose (1.2 g/kg of body weight) or insulin (0.1 units/kg of body weight) solubilized in 0.9% NaCl. Animals were anesthetized with 65 mg/kg of body weight of sodium pentobarbital approximately 15 min prior to drawing blood from the retro-orbital venous sinus. Animals were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital as described above. Islets were isolated after digestion of the pancreas by intraductal injection of 1 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) dissolved in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB) solution as described elsewhere (15.Sutton R. Peters M. McShane P. Gray D.W. Morris P.J. Transplantation. 1986; 42: 689-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 16.Kakei M. Nakazaki M. Kamisaki T. Nagayama I. Fukamachi Y. Tanaka H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 1226-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Collected islets were used directly or dispersed mechanically into single cells in a Ca2+-free KRBB solution for electrophysiological measurements. For batch experiments, islets were preincubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.8 mm glucose, and then the islets (10 islets/well in 24-well plates on TranswellTM permeable supports, 6.5 mm in diameter, 8.0 μm pore size; Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were incubated overnight in 0.75 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and test concentrations of glucose equilibrated with 5% CO2/95% air, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Perifusion was done following Komatsu et al. (17.Komatsu M. Aizawa T. Yokokawa N. Sato Y. Okada N. Takasu N. Yamada T. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), with modifications. One hundred islets in a column of Bio-Gel P-10 (Bio-Rad) were continuously perifused at 37 °C with Hepes-NaHCO3 KRBB with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (equilibrated with 5% CO2/95% air, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. After perifusion for 40 min under 2.8 mm glucose, solutions were changed as indicated in the figure. Test substances were added to the basal medium without adjustment of the final osmolarity. Dispersed islet cells were cultured for 1–3 days in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11.1 mm glucose with 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Standard patch clamp techniques were used to record ion channel currents (18.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). The pipette solution used for cell-attached recording contained 140 mmKCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 11 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The standard internal solution for whole-cell recording contained 50 mm KCl, 35 mmK2SO4, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 1. mm0 CaCl2, and 11 mm HEPES, and with or without ATP at the indicated concentrations, pH 7.2. The pipette solution for perforated patch recording contained 40 mm K2SO4, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2.0 mmMgCl2, and 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.2. Amphotericin B (240 μg/ml dissolved in 0.4% Me2SO) was included in the pipette to perforate the membrane. Isolated islet cells were superfused with KRBB containing 2.8 mm glucose, 129 mmNaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, and 5.0 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.4, for at least 30 min before recording. Currents were recorded using an AXOPATCH-1C (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) amplifier and analyzed using pCLAMP (Axon Instruments Inc.). All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). β-Cells were identified by a combination of their morphology and the presence of ATP-sensitive potassium currents. One-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of measurements. Tukey's post-test was used to compare pairs of group means. Statistical calculations were done using GraphPad Instat (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). We have summarized the results using mean values and standard deviations to accurately reflect the variability of the population. The Sur1gene was inactivated by replacing the second exon in mouse embryonic stem cells with a puromycin resistance cassette (Fig.1 A). The targeting vector was transfected into 129/SvJ embryonic stem cells by electroporation. Puromycin resistant clones were isolated and screened by Southern blotting to identify homologous recombinants. Two clones were injected into C57 BL/6 blastocysts to generate germline chimeras. The identification of Sur1 +/+,Sur1 –/+ and Sur1 –/–mice is shown (Fig. 1, B and C). The absence of SUR1 was confirmed using neuronal membranes. Sur1 was identified by photolabeling with [125I]azidoiodoglibenclamide as described previously (14.Clement IV J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) and is detectable in heterozygous, but not homozygous,Sur1 –/– animals (Fig. 1 D). The heterozygous and homozygous animals are viable, fertile, and phenotypically normal. The Sur1 –/– mice showed no obvious changes in birth weights, weight gains, or behavior to distinguish them from their wild type littermates. The loss of KATP channels in isolated pancreatic islet cells, predominantly β-cells, was established using the patch clamp technique. In the whole cell recording mode, control cells show a marked increase in K+ current that peaks at approximately 2 min (3.21 ± 0.62 nS/pF) after membrane rupture and dialysis of intracellular nucleotides and then proceed to “rundown” in the absence of ATP (Fig.2 A). TheSur1 –/– cells exhibit no comparable K+ currents. Comparison of the peak values of the normalized conductances of control versus heterozygous β-cells indicates that their densities of KATP channels are the same (Fig. 2 A, inset), implying a mechanism for regulation of channel density although the number of genes has been halved. Inclusion of ATP (1 mm) in the patch pipette reduces the peak currents and rate of channel rundown. The electrical activity ofSur1 +/+ and Sur1 –/–β-cells in low glucose solutions is markedly different. KATP channels are active in control cells (downward deflections in Fig. 2 B, top trace); the average resting membrane potential was –62.4 ± 12.3 mV, n = 48. By contrast, the membrane potential of theSur1 –/– cells fluctuated between –45 and –25 mV (82%, n = 28; average value, –32.6 ± 6.2 mV,n = 28) as a result of spontaneous action potentials (Fig. 2 B, bottom traces) that were not suppressed by diazoxide but were inhibited by the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transfer-mediated nick end labeling assays on control and Sur1 –/– adult islets showed no differences in apoptosis. Staining for insulin and somatostatin showed no differences, whereas glucagon staining revealed that the peripheral distribution of α-cells was disrupted with an increased number of glucagon positive cells within the interior of the central β-cell mass (data not shown). The cause of this redistribution is unclear, but it has been reported for the KIR6.2–/– mice (7.Miki T. Nagashima K. Tashiro F. Kotake K. Yoshitomi H. Tamamoto A. Gonoi T. Iwanaga T. Miyazaki J. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and for the β-cell specific knockout of the insulin receptor mice (19.Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), among others. Short term perifusion of islets revealed marked differences in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Control islets showed a brisk first phase of insulin secretion after an up-shift in glucose concentration that was entirely absent in theSur1 –/– islets (Fig.3 A). TheSur1 –/– islets exhibited a rise in insulin output that we interpret as an attenuated second phase release. This second release, measured as the average rate of release during the plateau period between 18 and 38 min, was approximately 35% of the control value. The control islets in 16.7 mm glucose exhibited a marked hypersecretion of insulin in response to tolbutamide, whereas the Sur1 –/– islets showed no increased secretion. Short term static incubation experiments confirmed this lack of response to tolbutamide. Glucose-stimulated insulin release from control andSur1 –/– islets over an 8-h period is summarized in Fig. 3 B. Note the broken time line and the change of scale on the y axis. TheSur1 –/– islets showed about a 4-fold increase in their rate of insulin release within 5 min; both the control andSur1 –/– islets exhibited a slow, parallel increase in insulin output through 500 min. The rate of insulin release of the Sur1 –/– islets at 400 or 500 min was approximately 30% of the controls. The results imply regulation of insulin release by a slow, KATP-independent, glucose-stimulated mechanism. To determine whether KATP channels play a role in returning insulin secretion to a basal level after a down-shift in glucose, the control and Sur1 –/– islets were switched to 2.8 mm glucose. Insulin output from the control islets dropped rapidly, t 12 = ∼5 min. By contrast, insulin output from Sur1 –/– islets fell slowly, t 12 = ∼67 min, averaged for these two experiments (Fig. 3 C). The results indicate KATPchannels, presumably by lowering the resting membrane potential, play a major role in wild type β-cells in “switching off” insulin release when glucose levels fall. The Sur1 –/–results show that the KATP-independent mechanism(s) has a much slower response time. The glucose-responsiveness of isolated islets was tested in extended static incubations at various glucose concentrations. Insulin release from bothSur1 –/– and control islets, integrated over 20 h, increased with glucose concentration (Fig.4), with half-maximal stimulation between 9 and 10 mm. Insulin output at the lowest glucose concentrations was indistinguishable, whereas the maximum output from the Sur1 –/– islets was ∼60% of the control value (285.1 ± 60.2 versus 494.5 ± 88.9,p < 0.0005). This insulin secretion requires Ca2+ influx and is sensitive to the Ca2+channel blocker nifedipine (Fig. 4, inset), implying that insulin output is coupled with glucose concentration via a Ca2+-sensitive mechanism. In Fig. 4, the hatched bar centered at ∼6.5 mm glucose indicates the range of glucose values in randomly feeding adult control andSur1 –/– mice (see Fig. 6).Figure 6Adult and neonatal glucose and insulin levels. Glucose and insulin values were measured in male and female adult mice, 12–16 weeks of age, in the fed and fasted states.A, the blood glucose levels of control and knockout animals drop in response to fasting, but the Sur1 –/–animals have lower values (males: 2.76 ± 0.65 versus3.63 ± 0.44 mm, p < 0.05,n = 20 or 19; females: 2.76 ± 0.94versus 3.82 ± 0.52 mm, p< 0.05, n = 16 or 15). There were no significant differences by one-way analysis of variance in the glucose values of the control versus Sur1 –/– animals in the fed state (p > 0.05 for +/+ versus–/– males and for +/+ versus –/– females,n = 21, 20, 15, and 16, respectively; the average value was 6.53 ± 0.99 mm, n = 72).B, the insulin/glucose ratios of theSur1 –/– animals were higher than the controls, although only the difference for males was significant (0.33 ± 0.13 versus 0.146 ± 0.07 ng/ml/mm,p < 0.001, n = 20 or 19). The insulin/glucose ratios for randomly feeding animals were not significantly different (p > 0.05, for +/+versus –/– males and for +/+ versus –/– females, n = 21, 20, 15, and 16, respectively; the average value was 0.172 ± 0.085 ng/ml/mm,n = 69). Error bars are ±S.D. Neonatal glucose and insulin levels were measured in control andSur1 –/– mice at 1 and 5 days of age and plotted against body weights. C, the 1- and 2-day blood glucose values show little correlation with body weight (r = –0.22, –0.31, and 0.048, n = 10, for 1-day control animals (open circles), 1-daySur1 –/– animals (open squares), and 2-day Sur1 –/– animals (gray squares), respectively). The mean 1-day blood glucose values for the control (3.73 ± 0.53 mm) andSur1 –/– pups (1.73 ± 0.49 mm) are both hypoglycemic relative to the mean adult level (6.53 ± 0.99 mm), but theSur1 –/– pups have lower glucose values, normalized against body weight, than controls (1.12 ± 0.32versus 2.56 ± 0.44 mm/gm,n = 10, p < 0.001; seeinset). The 5-day values for theSur1 –/– pups (filled squares) exhibit a strong correlation with body weight (r = 0.91, n = 12), whereas the control values (filled circles) exhibit only a weak correlation (p = 0.55, n = 14). Comparison of the blood glucose values normalized against body weight (inset) show that the hypoglycemia of the Sur1 –/– pups resolves within 36–48 h, and by 5 days, the Sur1 –/–pups are significantly hyperglycemic relative to controls (2.11 ± 0.28, n = 12 versus 2.82 ± 0.25 mm/gm, p < 0.001, n = 14).D, comparison of the 1-day plasma insulin values shows that the Sur1 –/– pups are hyperinsulinemic relative to control animals (3.62 ± 2.16 versus 1.58 ± 1.28 ng/ml, p < 0.01, n = 26 and 10, respectively). Within 5 days, the plasma insulin values of theSur1 –/– animals (0.72 ± 0.28 ng/ml) were lower than the controls (1.29 ± 0.88 ng/ml), but the difference is not significant at the p = 0.05 level (n = 12 and 14, respectively). The insetcompares the plasma insulin/blood glucose ratios (see text). Theerror bars in the insets are ±S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In response to a glucose challenge the Sur1 –/–animals exhibit mild glucose intolerance (Fig.5 A); their peak glucose values are higher and their clearance times longer versus control mice (15.1 ± 3.2 versus 13.5 ± 2.6 mm at 15 min, p < 0.01, and 12.8 ± 2.0 versus 7.4 ± 0.8 mm at 60 min,p < 0.001). Consistent with the lack of first phase release from isolated islets, the Sur1 –/–animals showed little increase in insulin output after intraperitoneal glucose injection, in marked contrast to the robust increase seen in control animals (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that mice have both insulin-induced and insulin-independent pathways for glucose disposal. In contrast to what has been reported for the KIR6.2–/– mice (7.Miki T. Nagashima K. Tashiro F. Kotake K. Yoshitomi H. Tamamoto A. Gonoi T. Iwanaga T. Miyazaki J. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), theSur1 –/– animals showed no increased insulin sensitivity. Following intraperitoneal injection of insulin. the glucose values of both groups dropped with no significant differences (Fig. 5 C). The blood glucose levels of random-fed adultSur1 –/– mice were normal, and their plasma insulin/blood glucose ratios did not differ significantly from those of the controls (Fig. 6, A andB). By contrast, Sur1 –/– animals fasted for 16 h were significantly more hypoglycemic than similarly fasted control animals (2.76 ± 0.65 versus3.63 ± 0.44 mm, p < 0.05 for males, and 2.76 ± 0.94 versus 3.82 ± 0.52 mm, p < 0.05, for females). This result is consistent with the inability of Sur1 –/–islets to restrict their insulin output rapidly when glucose levels fall. The data in Fig. 3 C suggest the plasma insulin levels of the Sur1 –/– mice will be higher than those of the controls for nearly 3 h. Although the insulin levels are expected to equalize before the end of the fast, theSur1 –/– mice appear to be unable to compensate for the increased insulin and bring their glucose levels back to the fasted control level. The fasted plasma insulin/blood glucose ratios support this interpretation; both male and femaleSur1 –/– mice have higher mean ratios than controls (0.33 ± 0.13 versus 0.15 ± 0.07 for males and 0.24 ± 0.11 versus 0.15 ± 0.05 ng/ml/mm for females), although only the males are significantly different (p < 0.001). Loss of β-cell KATP channel activity and appearance of spontaneous Ca2+ action potentials in PHHI patients is associated with unregulated insulin release (20.Kaiser N. Corcos A.P. Tur S.A. Ariav Y. Glaser B. Landau H. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 1990; 33: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and severe neonatal hypoglycemia (21.Dunne M.J. Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Sanchez J.A. James R.F.L. Johnson P.R.V. Aynsley-Green A. Lu S. Clement IV J.P. Lindley K.J. Seino S. Aguilar-Bryan L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The clinical phenotype of PHHI patients strongly suggested that the Sur1 –/–mice would show severe, persistent hypoglycemia. This was not the case. The Sur1 –/– pups were hypoglycemic 1 day after birth (1.73 ± 0.49 mm), and their insulin/blood glucose ratios were inappropriately high versus control values (2.31 ± 1.56 versus 0.42 ± 0.33 ng/ml/mm, p < 0.001), but this hypoglycemia reversed during the second day, and the insulin/glucose ratio reached a normal value (Fig. 6, C andD). The blood glucose values of the 5-day Sur1 –/–pups display a correlation with body weight that was not apparent in the controls, and the 5-day Sur1 –/– pups were significantly hyperglycemic versus controls (8.29 ± 1.71 versus 6.23 ± 0.47 mm,p < 0.001). The Sur1 –/–insulin/blood glucose ratio was half that of the controls, although the difference is not significant (0.09 ± 0.04 versus0.20 ± 0.13 ng/ml/mm, p > 0.05). This hyperglycemia in the 5-day Sur1 –/– pups is consistent with the reduced insulin output of their islets at high glucose concentrations (Fig. 4). The interaction of SUR and KIR6.x subunits is tightly integrated with both required to form KATP channels (1.Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2.Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement IV J.P. Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). On the other hand, K+ currents have been reported when KIR6.2 subunits are overexpressed using strong promoters (22.John S.A. Monck J.R. Weiss J.N. Ribalet B. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23.Mikhailov M.V. Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or when the endogenous ER retention signals described by Zerangue et al. (24.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) are removed (25.Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M.

Although homomeric KIR6.2 channels have the same conductance as wild type KATP channels and exhibit low sensitivity to inhibitory ATP, they differ in all other respects. We saw no indication that KIR6.2 subunits reach the cell surface without SUR1, and we expected that their presence in the plasma membrane, unregulated by SUR1, would result in hyperpolarization, reduced insulin secretion, and profound hyperglycemia. There was no indication that other K+ channels arise to compensate for the loss of SUR1/KIR6.2 channels. The loss of KATP channel activity leads to a specific β-cell “electrophysiological” phenotype now described in three systems: human PHHI (21.Dunne M.J. Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Sanchez J.A. James R.F.L. Johnson P.R.V. Aynsley-Green A. Lu S. Clement IV J.P. Lindley K.J. Seino S. Aguilar-Bryan L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 28.Kane C. Shepherd R.M.

Tashiro F. Kotake K. Yoshitomi H. Tamamoto A. Gonoi T. Iwanaga T. Miyazaki J. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and Sur1 –/– β-cells. This phenotype is characterized 1) by the loss of K+ currents activated by reduced intracellular nucleotides (shown for all three systems), 2) by an elevated membrane potential (also shown for all three systems), and 3) by spontaneous Ca2+ action potentials (shown for PHHI and Sur1 –/– β-cells) that increase [Ca2+]i (shown for PHHI and KIR6.2–/– β-cells). This KATP–/– β-cell phenotype agrees with the “classical ionic mechanism,” or KATP-dependent pathway, proposed to rapidly control glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (4.Cook D.L. Taborsky G.J. Porte D. Sherwin R.S. Elleberg and Rifkin's Diabetes Mellitus. 5th Ed. Appleton and Lange, Stamford, CT1997: 49-73Google Scholar, 29.Atwater I. Mears D. Rojas E. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippencott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 78-102Google Scholar). The loss of KATP channel activity produces remarkably different alterations in glucose homeostasis in PHHI neonatesversus KATP–/– mice. Although PHHI is a heterogeneous disorder (1.Aguilar-Bryan"
https://openalex.org/W2033818790,"We have isolated from the rat cerebellum cDNA library a complementary DNA encoding a new member of the tandem pore K+ channel family. Its amino acid sequence shares 54% identity with that of TASK-1, but less than 30% with those of TASK-2 and other tandem pore K+ channels (TWIK, TREK, TRAAK). Therefore, the new clone was named TASK-3. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that TASK-3 mRNA is expressed in many rat tissues including brain, kidney, liver, lung, colon, stomach, spleen, testis, and skeletal muscle, and at very low levels in the heart and small intestine. When expressed in COS-7 cells, TASK-3 exhibited a time-independent, noninactivating K+-selective current. Single-channel conductance was 27 pS at −60 mV and 17 pS at 60 mV in symmetrical 140 mm KCl. TASK-3 current was highly sensitive to changes in extracellular pH (pHo), a hallmark of the TASK family of K+channels. Thus, a change in pHo from 7.2 to 6.4 and 6.0 decreased TASK-3 current by 74 and 96%, respectively. Mutation of histidine at position 98 to aspartate abolished pHosensitivity. TASK-3 was blocked by barium (57%, 3 mm), quinidine (37%, 100 μm), and lidocaine (62%, 1 mm). Thus, TASK-3 is a new member of the acid-sensing K+ channel subfamily (TASK).

Mammalian K+ channels can now be grouped into three main structural classes with each subunit possessing two, four, or six transmembrane segments (1.Rudy B.

Despite the structural diversity, all K+ channel subunits share a conserved P domain that is essential for providing K+ selectivity (7.Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, ∼50 putative K+ channels subunits possessing two pore-forming domains and four transmembrane segments (2P/4TM)1 have been identified by searching the genome sequences (10.Wei A. Jegla T. Salkoff L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 805-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 11.Wang Z.W. Kunkel M.T. Wei A. Butler A. Salkoff L. Annu. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 286-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recent cloning efforts have led to the identification of several members of the 2P/4TM K+ channels. Open rectifier K+ channel (ORK1) from Drosophila melanogaster and tandem of P domains in a weak inward rectifying K+ channel (TWIK-1) from human kidney were the first two members of this family to be cloned (12.Goldstein S.N. Price L.A. Rosenthal D.N. Pausch M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13256-13261Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13.Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Recent studies now indicate that TWIK-1 does not form a functional ion channel, whereas the open rectifier K+ channel 1 does (14.Goldstein S.A.N. Wang K.-W. Ilan N. Pausch M.H. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,15.Pountney D.J. Gulkarov I. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Holmes D. Saganich M. Rudy B. Artman M. Coetzee W.A.

Subsequently, other members of this family were cloned using expressed sequence tags identified by searching the GenBankTM data base for TWIK-1-like sequences or using degenerate primers designed to amplify a DNA fragment with sequences homologous to TWIK-1. Electrophysiological studies of 4TM K+ channels suggest that most behave as background K+ currents (ORK1, TASK, TREK, TRAAK), although some have additional properties such as sensitivity to mechanical stretch, free fatty acids (TREK, TRAAK (16.Fink M.

Two other 4TM K+ channel members (KCNK6/7) were not expressed in the plasma membrane when transfected intoXenopus oocytes, COS-7, or HEK293 cells (22.Salinas M. Reyes R. Lesage F. Fosset M.

As 2P/4TM K+ channels generally share less than 30% amino acid identity, they are likely to be involved in diverse physiological processes. Of the 2P/4TM K+ channel family, two members have been named TASK-1 and TASK-2 (for TWIK-relatedAcid-sensitive K+channel), as they exhibit high sensitivity to extracellular pH near the physiological range (20.Duprat M. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 21.Reyes R. Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Salinas M. Farman N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30863-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Despite the overall structural conservation (2P/4TM) and similar pH sensitivity, TASK-1 and TASK-2 share only 27% amino acid identity, and the expression patterns of their mRNA transcripts in mouse tissues are different (21.Reyes R. Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Salinas M. Farman N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30863-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). According to Northern blot analysis, TASK-1 is expressed mainly in the mouse heart and lung, whereas TASK-2 is expressed primarily in the kidney, pancreas, liver, and placenta. Both TASK-1 and TASK-2 exhibit functional K+ currents with properties of a “background” current when expressed heterologously, suggesting that one of their functions may be to help set the resting membrane potential. In rat atrial and ventricular myocytes where TASK-1 mRNA are expressed (23.Kim D. Fujita A. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24.Kim Y. Bang H.W. Kim D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1669-H1678PubMed Google Scholar), we were able to identify a K+channel with kinetic properties indistinguishable from those of TASK-1 transiently expressed in mammalian cells (24.Kim Y. Bang H.W. Kim D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1669-H1678PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that TASK-1 encodes a functional K+ channel that exists in mammalian cells. In this study, we report the cloning of TASK-3 (KCNK9) 2TASK3 has been given the gene name KCNK9 (approved by HUGO).2TASK3 has been given the gene name KCNK9 (approved by HUGO)., a new member of the TASK family, and describe its electrophysiological and pharmacological properties and tissue expression. TASK-3 shares 54% amino acid identity with TASK-1 but less than 30% with other 2P/4TM K+ channels. Our results show that TASK-3 mRNA is expressed in many tissues but at relatively very low levels in the heart, indicating that TASK-3 is unlikely to be the functional partner for TASK-1 in the rat heart. When expressed in COS-7 cells, TASK-3 exhibited an instantaneous and noninactivating K+-selective current with high sensitivity to extracellular pH. The sensitivity to pHo was conferred by the histidine residue at position 98 that is located near the selectivity filter of the channel pore. Thus, TASK-3 may help to set the resting membrane potential and contribute to the pHo-dependent K+ conductance in different types of cells. Rat heart and cerebellum cDNA libraries (λZAPII, Stratagene) were screened with theHindIII-KpnI DNA fragment (560 bp) of mouse TASK-1 using a mild stringency wash condition as described previously (23.Kim D. Fujita A. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). No positive plaque was obtained from the heart cDNA library. Of 106 plaques screened using the cerebellum cDNA library, one positive colony was found to contain a 1.7-kb insert. DNA sequencing showed that this clone (designated 4f) contained a partial sequence of a new 4TM K+ channel, as judged by the presence of two P domains with amino acids Gly-Tyr-Gly and Gly-Phe-Gly within these regions, respectively. A search of the GenBankTM data base indicated that the new K+ channel clone was ∼60% similar to TASK-1. To obtain the full sequence, we prepared a 496-bp DNA fragment of 4f by PCR using two specific primers (5′-TGACTACTATAGGGTTCGGC-3′ and 5′-AAGTAGGTGTTCCTCAGCACG-3′) as a probe to rescreen the rat cerebellum cDNA library. After several rounds of screening, the inserts from positive plaques were excised from the phage DNA into pBluescript SK− vector. The inserts were analyzed by restriction enzymes and by sequencing of both strands using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. One clone contained the entire coding sequence of the new K+ channel, which we named TASK-3. Single amino acid mutations were performed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Rat multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. A TASK-3-specific probe (827 bp) was prepared by PCR using a primer pair (5′-AGCTTCAGAGAGGATGGGCCTCTAT-3′ and 5′-AAGTAGGTGTTCCTCAGCACG-3′) and included the 3′-end of the coding sequence that has low homology with TASK-1. Prehybridization (4 h, 42 °C) and hybridization (overnight, 42 °C) were carried out using 32P-labeled DNA probe. Blots were washed in solution containing 0.1% SDS and 2× SSC for 20 min at room temperature and then in solution containing 0.1% SDS and 0.2% SSC for an additional 10–20 min at 50 °C. Blots were exposed to x-ray film for 24–72 h before developing. For RT-PCR experiments, total RNA was isolated from 14 rat tissues (cerebrum, cerebellum, aorta, atrium, ventricle, kidney, liver, lung, colon, stomach, spleen, testis, skeletal muscle, and small intestine) using RNA STAT-60 (TEL-TEST). Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed to generate first strand cDNA with a Superscript Pre-amplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was carried out with TASK-3-specific primers that yield the 496-bp TASK-3 fragment (see above). As control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified using specific primers (CLONTECH). PCR conditions were 30 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. Amplified products were subcloned into pCR2.1 vector and sequenced on one strand to confirm the PCR product as TASK-3. For transfection into the COS-7 cell, 2.1-kb DNA containing the entire coding region was subcloned into pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) by ligating into theEcoRV-HindIII sites after cutting TASK-3/pBluscript SK− with DraI andHindIII. COS-7 cells were seeded at low density (25,000 cells/35-mm dish) for 1 day prior to transfection. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with TASK-3 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CLONTECH) in pcDNA3.1 using LipoTaxi (Life Technologies, Inc.) transfection reagent. Green fluorescence from GFP-expressing cells was identified using a Nikon microscope equipped with excitation and barrier filters (470–510 nm) and a mercury lamp light source. Gigaseals were formed using Sylgard-coated thin walled borosilicate pipettes (Kimax). Single channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments), digitized with a digital data recorder (VR10, Instrutech), and stored on video tape using a video tape recorder. The recorded signal was filtered at 3 kHz using an 8-pole Bessel filter (−3 dB, Frequency Devices) and transferred to a computer (Dell) using the Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments) at a sampling rate of 10 kHz. The filter dead time was ∼100 μs (0.3Fc), and therefore events shorter than ∼50 μs will be missed in our analysis. Single channel currents were analyzed using a pCLAMP program to obtain duration histogram, amplitude histogram, and channel activity (NPo).N is the number of channels in the patch, andPo is the probability of a channel being open.NPo was determined from ∼1–2 min of current recording. Macroscopic currents from COS-7 cells were recorded using the whole-cell or large outside-out configuration. Current tracings shown in figures were filtered at 1 kHz. Data are shown as mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used to test for significance between two values at the level of 0.05. For single channel studies at high [K+]o, the pipette and bath solutions contained 140 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.2). When studying the effect of pH and protein kinases, macroscopic currents were recorded using a physiological bath solution containing 118 mm NaCl, 1.3 mmKH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 4.7 mm KCl, and 1 mmMgSO4. All experiments were performed at 23–25 °C. We used a 560-bp DNA fragment that encompasses the pore and C-terminal region of rat TASK-1 and screened rat cardiac and cerebellum cDNA libraries. One positive clone containing a partial sequence (1.7 kb) of a novel two-domain K+ channel was obtained from screening the cerebellum cDNA library. After several rounds of screening using the 3′-region of the 1.7-kb DNA fragment as a probe, one positive clone containing the entire open reading frame of 1185 bases encoding a 395-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 44 kDa was finally isolated (Fig. 1 A). This clone had only a partial 3′-noncoding region and did not include the poly(A) sequence. Hydrophobicity analysis (25.Kyte J. Doolittle R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 162-166Crossref Scopus (16899) Google Scholar) of the amino acid sequence showed that the new clone belongs to the K+ channel family with two pore-forming domains and four transmembrane segments (Fig.1 B). We placed the N terminus in the intracellular side, similar to those of other tandem pore K+ channels. Thus, the putative K+ channel subunit has a short N terminus, an extended extracellular loop between M1 and P1, and a long C terminus, structural features typical of nearly all 4TM K+ channels (Fig. 1 C). One N-glycosylation site is present in the extended extracellular loop between M1 and P1, similar to that found in several other K+ channels of this class, including TASK-1 and TASK-2. The amino acid sequence of the new clone shows several potential phosphorylation sites. Consensus sites for protein kinase A are found in the intracellular loop between M2 and M3 (Thr-134), at the proximal site in the C terminus (Thr-247), and at the end of the C terminus (Ser-394). Three sites for protein kinase C are found all in the C terminus (Ser-277, Ser-340, Ser-352). Potential phosphorylation sites for tyrosine kinase were not present. Searching the GenBankTM data base using the BLAST sequence alignment program (26.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) indicated that the DNA sequence of the new clone is most similar to that of TASK-1, a 4TM K+ channel that was cloned earlier (20.Duprat M.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 868-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 2P/4TM K+ channel clone named TASK-2 has been described recently but has low homology with that of TASK-1 or the new clone (21.Reyes R. Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Salinas M. Farman N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30863-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We therefore named our new clone TASK-3. A putative homologue of rat TASK-3 was identified in the genome data base of human chromosome 8 (GenBank TM accession number AC007869; locus D8S1741). Combined partial sequences from two locations with an intervening sequence of ∼84 kb showed 72% identity in the amino acid sequence with rat TASK-3. Within the first 250 amino acids of rat TASK-3 and the human homologue, the identity was 94%. Fig. 2 A shows alignment of three TASK sequences, which reveal high homology between TASK-1 and TASK-3, especially within the transmembrane and pore-forming domains. TASK-1 and TASK-3 share 54% identity and 61% similarity in amino acid sequences, whereas TASK-2 is distantly related with 27% amino acid identity with TASK-1 and 26% with TASK-3. Therefore, TASK-1 and TASK-3 probably share close functional similarity, although this has yet to be demonstrated. The dendrogram of all tandem pore K+ channels identified in the mammalian system is shown in Fig. 2. The percentage indicates amino acid identity. To determine which tissues express TASK-3 mRNA, Northern blot analysis was performed using rat multiple tissue blots (OriGene Technologies). No TASK-3 transcripts could be detected in the 12 tissues (Brain, heart, kidney, stomach, small intestine, muscle, spleen, thymus, liver, lung, testis, and skin), suggesting that TASK-3 mRNA is expressed at low levels or not expressed at all. To be sure of this result, we repeated the same experiment three times with new blots. In all three cases, no TASK-3 transcripts were detected. Under similar conditions and blots, we could clearly detect expression of TASK-1, as reported previously (23.Kim D. Fujita A. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 27.Leonoudakis D. Gray A.T. Winegar B.D. Kindler C.H. Harada M. Taylor D.M. Chavez R.A. Forsayeth J.R. Yost C.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 868-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used RT-PCR to further examine the tissue distribution of TASK-3. Of the 14 tissues examined, the 496-bp PCR product of TASK-3 could be detected in most tissues. The relative signal was low in ventricle and barely detectable in the aorta, atria, and small intestine (Fig. 3). To determine whether TASK-3 is capable of forming a functional ion channel, cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA3.1) and transfected along with DNA that encodes GFP into COS-7 cells. Whole cell currents were first recorded in solution containing 140 mm KCl (pipette and bath). Cell membrane potential was held at 0 mV and stepped to various potentials for a 500-ms duration. In cells transfected with GFP alone, only very small currents of less than 50 pA were recorded. In cells transfected with TASK-3/GFP, the same voltage steps produced large instantaneous and noninactivating currents (Fig. 4 A). The whole-cell current varied nearly linearly with voltage as shown by the current-voltage relationship. A large fraction of the inward currents was reversibly blocked by 3 mm Ba2+ applied extracellularly. These results show that TASK-3 forms functional ion channels in COS-7 cells. To characterize single channel properties of TASK-3, cell-attached patches were first formed. Nearly all COS-7 cells transfected with TASK-3 exhibited robust channel activity that did not decrease with time. Inside-out patches showed similar channel activity, indicating that TASK-3 is not regulated by soluble intracellular molecules in the cell under basal conditions. COS-7 cells transfected with GFP alone showed no such channel activity. Channel openings at different membrane potentials are shown in Fig. 4 B when both pipette and bath solutions contained 140 mm KCl. An amplitude histogram obtained from channel openings at −60 mV shows a single peak (Fig.4 C). The duration histogram obtained from a patch with only one level of channel opening shows that TASK-3 has a mean open time of 1.1 ± 0.1 ms at −60 mV (Fig. 4 D; n = 5). The single channel current-voltage relationship shows that TASK-3 is a weak inward rectifier K+ channel (Fig. 4 E) similar to that observed with TASK-1 (23.Kim D. Fujita A. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24.Kim Y. Bang H.W. Kim D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1669-H1678PubMed Google Scholar). The conductances of TASK-3 were 27.1 ± 1.6 pS at −60 mV and 17.0 ± 2.2 pS at +60 mV. Ion selectivity of TASK-3 was studied by changing the concentration of K+ in the bath solution from 10 to 280 mm while maintaining the pipette [K+] constant at 140 mm. As shown in Fig.5 A, the reversal potential shifted to the right as [K+] in the bath solution was elevated, as expected of an ion channel that is permeable to K+ but not to Cl−. The plot of the reversal potential as a function of [K+] showed that the slope was 51 ± 3 mV/10-fold change in [K+], close to the calculated Nernst value of 58 mV (Fig. 5 B). These results confirm that TASK-3 is a relatively K+-selective ion channel, similar to TASK-1 and other two pore K+channels. The effects of various pharmacological agents were examined on the TASK-3 current using outside-out patches from COS-7 cells. TASK-3 was insensitive to low concentrations of Ba2+ (<100 μm) and was blocked only at high concentrations (>300 μm). Ba2+ at 3 mm applied extracellularly blocked the inward TASK-3 current by 56 ± 9% (n = 4). TASK-3 was insensitive to 1 mm tetraethylammonium, 100 μm zinc chloride, and 170 mm ethanol. Quinidine (100 μm), lidocaine (1 mm), and bupivacaine (100 μm) caused 37 ± 6%, 62 ± 9%, and 56 ± 13%, respectively, inhibition of TASK-3 current (n = 3). Intracellular application of 10 μm Ca2+, 30 mm Na+, and 4 mm MgATP using inside-out patches had no significant effect on TASK-3 current (n = 3). However, GTPγS applied intracellularly produced a 30 ± 3% (n = 4) decrease in TASK-3 current, suggesting that a GTP-binding protein-dependent pathway regulates TASK-3 activity. Arachidonic acid (10 μm) showed a strong inhibitory activity from the intracellular side of the membrane, reducing TASK-3 current by 59 ± 4% (n = 3). TASK-3 channel activity in cell-attached or inside-out patches was insensitive to suction pressure applied to the patches (0 to −60 mm Hg). TASK-3 possesses potential phosphorylation sites for both protein kinase A and C. Extracellular application of phorbol myristate acetate (100 nm), an activator of protein kinase C, failed to alter TASK-3 whole-cell current (n = 5). Application of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (300 μm) and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (100 μm) together, which should increase cAMP concentration in the cell and activate protein kinase A, also failed to alter TASK-3 current. Forskolin (10 μm), an activator of adenylyl cyclase and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (100 μm) together, also did not affect TASK-3 current. Therefore, TASK-3 does not appear to be regulated via phosphorylation by protein kinases A and C. A hallmark of TASK-1 and TASK-2 K+ channels is their sensitivity to pHo. To determine whether TASK-3 also possesses similar pH sensitivity, we first examined TASK-3 current using large outside-out patches from COS-7 cells transfected with TASK-3 and GFP. Cell membrane potential was held at −80 mV and then a voltage ramp (−100 to +100 mV; 640 ms duration) was applied. TASK-3 currents were measured at different pHo values (Fig. 6 A). TASK-3 was markedly inhibited by extracellular acidification (pH 6.0–7.2) at all membrane potentials. At pHo 6.4 and 6.0, the current decreased to 74 ± 17% and 96 ± 3%, respectively, of that observed at pHo 7.2. An increase in pHo above 7.2 caused a small rise in TASK-3 current, showing that TASK-3 is less sensitive to changes in pHo in the alkaline range (7.2–8.4). Averaged currents at different pHo values at −20, +20, and +60 mV were determined from three experiments and plotted in Fig.6 B. The data were fitted to a Hill equation of the form:y = 1/(1 + (k 1/2/[H+]) n), where k 1/2 is the [H+] at which half maximal inhibition occurs and n is the Hill coefficient. At −20 mV, apparent k 1/2 was 1.8 × 10−7m corresponding to a pK of 6.7, and the Hill coefficient was 2.0 (mean values,n = 3). At +20 mV, the pK and Hill coefficient were 6.7 and 1.8, respectively. For currents recorded at +60 mV, the pK and the Hill coefficient were 6.6 and 1.7, respectively. To study in more detail the effect of changes in pHo and pHi on TASK-3 kinetics, we recorded single channel currents from outside-out and inside-out patches, respectively, at different pHo values. Fig. 6 C shows channel openings from an outside-out patch showing the effect of changing the pHo of the bath solution from 7.2 to 6.4, 6.0, 8.0 and then back to 7.2. Amplitude histograms obtained from such tracings at different pHo values are also shown. Current-voltage relationships show that the single channel conductance is not significantly altered between pHo6.0 and 7.2 (Fig. 6 D). However, changing pHo from 7.2 to 8.0 caused a significant increase in single channel conductance. Relative channel current was obtained by multiplyingNPo and single channel current (i) at −60 mV and then plotted as a function of pHo. Fig.6 E shows that TASK-3 is particularly sensitive to changes in pHo ranging from 6.0 and 7.2. These results show that the marked decrease in channel activity observed at low pHo is predominantly because of a decreased frequency of opening. Fig.6 F shows results obtained from inside-out patches in which the pH of the bath solution (pHi) was sequentially changed from 8.0 to 7.2, 6.4, and 6.0. Changing pHi did not significantly affect the single channel conductance. At pH 6.4 and 6.0, TASK-3 current was 81 ± 9% and 77 ± 11%, respectively, of that observed at pH 7.2. These results show that TASK-3 is much more sensitive to pHo than to pHi and that the effect of pHo is not mediated via changes in pHi. To identify the amino acid residue responsible for the marked sensitivity to pHo, we mutated two histidine residues (His-72 and His-98) that are conserved in TASK-1 and TASK-3 (see Fig. 1). Four mutant TASK-3 (H72D, H72Q, H98D, and H72Q/H98D) were generated and tested for their pHo sensitivity. Outside-out patches from COS-7 cells were used to measure single channel activity at different pHo. The single channel conductance at pH 7.2 was 26 ± 2 pS for the H98D mutant and 33 ± 2 pS for the H72D mutant (n = 4), indicating that modifications of the long extracellular loop between TM1 and TM2 alter channel conductance. As shown in Fig. 7 A, pHo sensitivity of the H72D mutation was similar to that of wild type TASK-3. pHo sensitivity of the H72Q mutant was also similar to that of the wild type TASK3, showing greater than 90% reduction in current by a decrease in pHo from 7.2 to 6.0. However, the H98D or H72Q/H98D mutation abolished the acid-induced decrease"

Here we show that Notch1 endogenously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is modified with O-linked fucose andO-linked glucose saccharides, two unusual forms ofO-linked glycosylation found on epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) modules. Interestingly, both modifications occur as monosaccharide and oligosaccharide species. Through exoglycosidase digestions we determined that the O-linked fucose oligosaccharide is a tetrasaccharide with a structure identical to that found on human clotting factor IX: Sia-α2,3-Gal-β1,4-GlcNAc-β1,3-Fuc-α1-O-Ser/Thr. The elongated form of O-linked glucose appears to be a trisaccharide. Notch1 is the first membrane-associated protein identified with either O-linked fucose orO-linked glucose modifications. It also represents the second protein discovered with an elongated form ofO-linked fucose.

O-Linked fucose and O-linked glucose are two unusual forms of glycosylation where the sugars, fucose or glucose, are attached directly to proteins through the hydroxyls of serine or threonine residues. They were discovered within the past 10 years on a small number of secreted proteins, most of which are involved in the blood coagulation cascade or clot dissolution. Both modifications occur exclusively within epidermal growth factor-like (EGF1) modules (for review see Ref. 1.Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). EGF modules, which are typically 30 to 40 amino acids in length, are a common structural motif found on numerous secreted and cell-surface proteins (2.Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). They often mediate protein-protein interactions. The hallmarks of the EGF module are six conserved cysteine residues, which participate in three disulfide bridges, giving the module a distinct three-dimensional fold. Other than the conserved cysteine residues, the sequences of different EGF modules are highly divergent. Comparison of the sequences surrounding the O-linked fucose and O-linked glucose modification sites led to the identification of putative consensus sequences for the addition of these sugars (3.Harris R.J. Van Halbeek H. Glushka J. Basa L.J. Ling V.T. Smith K.J. Spellman M.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6539-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The O-linked fucose consensus site is located between the second and third conserved cysteines of the EGF module (C2 XXGGS/TC3, whereX represents any amino acid), whereas theO-linked glucose consensus site resides between the first and second conserved cysteines (C1 XSXPC2). Because the sites are at distinct locations, both modifications can occur within a single EGF module. Indeed, some proteins are known to bear both modifications on the same EGF module (e.g. clotting factors VII and IX), demonstrating that the addition of one sugar does not interfere with the addition of the other. Interestingly, proteins bearing these modifications have been reported to be stoichiometrically modified (1.Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cellular glycosylation machinery is extremely efficient. O-Linked fucose is now known to exist as both monosaccharide and elongated species. Human clotting factor IX was reported to containO-linked fucose elongated into a tetrasaccharide with the structure Sia-α2,6-Gal-β1,4-GlcNAc-β1,3-Fuc-α1-O-Ser (3.Harris R.J. Van Halbeek H. Glushka J. Basa L.J. Ling V.T. Smith K.J. Spellman M.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6539-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4.Nishimura H. Takao T. Hase S. Shimonishi Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17520-17525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding was surprising since fucose is typically thought of as a terminal (non-elongated) modification in mammalian systems. All otherO-linked fucose-modified proteins were reported to bear a simple monosaccharide. Recently, we demonstrated thatO-linked fucose can also be elongated into the disaccharide Glc-β1,3-Fuc-α1-O-Ser/Thr (5.Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, fucose may be elongated through the addition of a β-linked glucose to form the disaccharide or, alternatively, through the addition of a β-linkedN-acetylglucosamine, which subsequently results in the formation of the tetrasaccharide. We also showed that elongation ofO-linked fucose is a protein-specific phenomenon (5.Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The signals that direct the protein-specific elongation ofO-linked fucose are currently unknown. O-Linked glucose in all cases has been shown to be elongated by either one or two xyloses to yield a di- or trisaccharide, respectively (6.Nishimura H. Kawabata S. Kisiel W. Hase S. Ikenaka T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20320-20325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have begun to identify some of the enzymes responsible for addition of these sugars. Enzyme activities capable of catalyzing the addition of O-linked glucose to proteins (the peptideO-glucosyltransferase (7.Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1998; 8 (abstr.): 1110Google Scholar)) and of elongatingO-linked glucose (theO-glucose-α1,3-xylosyltransferase (8.Omichi K. Aoki K. Minamida S. Hase S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the xylose-α1,3-xylosyltransferase (9.Minamida S. Aoki K. Natsuka S. Omichi K. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Hase S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1002-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) have been identified and characterized. The peptide O-fucosyltransferase responsible for the addition of O-linked fucose to protein has been purified and characterized from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (10.Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, we have identified the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the O-linked fucose disaccharide (theO-fucose β1,3-glucosyltransferase) (11.Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These enzymes are found in a variety of tissues and species, suggesting that these carbohydrate modifications are widespread in biology. Notch is a large (>300 kDa) cell-surface receptor that contains 36 tandem EGF modules comprising the majority of its extracellular domain (12.Wharton K.A. Johansen K.M. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1985; 43: 567-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). It is known to play a key role in many developmental cascades including neurogenesis, somite formation, angiogenesis, and lymphoid development (13.Fleming R.J. Purcell K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Homologous components of the Notch signaling pathway are present in organisms ranging from Caenorhabditis elegansto humans. Although Drosophila contains just one Notch homolog, four Notch homologs are present in mammalian systems designated Notch1–4. The EGF modules of Notch are known to be involved in ligand binding (13.Fleming R.J. Purcell K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Notch signaling is induced upon binding to its cell-surface ligands, Delta and Jagged (or Serrate), on adjacent cells (13.Fleming R.J. Purcell K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Defects in Notch signaling caused by mutations in the EGF modules of Notch have been demonstrated to result in human disease states, including T cell leukemia (14.Ellisen L.W. Bird J. West D.C. Soreng A.L. Reynolds T.C. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1991; 66: 649-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar) and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) (15.Joutel A. Corpechot C. Ducros A. Vahedi K. Chabriat H. Mouton P. Alamowitch S. Domenga V. Cecillion M. Marechal E. Maciazek J. Vayssiere C. Cruaud C. Cabanis E.-A. Ruchoux M.M. Weissenbach J. Bach J.F.

Data base searches using the putative consensus sequences forO-linked fucose and O-linked glucose addition reveal that Notch contains more predicted sites than any other protein in the data base (12 O-linked fucose and 17O-linked glucose sites are found on human Notch1). In this report, we used CHO cells with defects in glycosylation (specifically Lec1 and Lec8 cells (16.Stanley P. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17.Stanley P. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18.Stanley P. Mol. Cell.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)) to investigate whether Notch1 is modified with O-linked fucose and O-linked glucose saccharides. We found that the Notch1 protein is endogenously expressed in CHO cells and contains both O-linked fucose andO-linked glucose modifications. Interestingly, a portion of the O-linked fucose found on Notch1 was in the form of the tetrasaccharide previously observed on human clotting factor IX. Many of the glycosylation sites of Notch are conserved across species, suggesting a biological significance for these unique carbohydrates. Lec1 and Lec8 cells were developed by Dr. Pamela Stanley (16.Stanley P. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17.Stanley P.

The synthesis and characterization of the β-linked GlcNAc-fucose disaccharide standards (GlcNAc-β1,2-fucose, GlcNAc-β1,3-fucose, and GlcNAc-β1,4-fucose) will be described elsewhere. 2J. Xia, R. Locke, and K. L. Matta, manuscript in preparation. They were synthesized as α-methyl glycosides and characterized by NMR. The free disaccharides were generated using acetolysis in acetic anhydride containing 2–3% sulfuric acid. Reduction of the resulting free disaccharides to their corresponding sugar alcohols was performed by reduction with sodium borohydride as described (24.Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2563-2568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lec1 cells or Lec8 cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of medium containing 20 μCi/ml [6-3H]fucose or 20 μCi/ml [6-3H]galactose, respectively. Cells were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl) and collected by centrifugation (1000 ×g, 3 min). Cell pellets (approximately 106cells/ml of lysis buffer) were lysed on ice in Tris-buffered saline with 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixtures I and II (22.Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8049-8057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (12000 ×g, 2 min, 4 °C). Chromatographic peaks from size fractionation on Superdex columns containing radioactivity were pooled, dried in a Speed-Vac evaporator (Savant), and resuspended in 50 μl of sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. N-Acetyl neuraminidase I (α2,3-specific sialidase) (10 milliunits), β1,4-galactosidase (D. pneumoniae) (5 milliunits), or β-hexosaminidase (jack bean) (250 milliunits) were added to appropriate samples (or mock-digested without enzyme) and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. Incubations were terminated by diluting the samples with 50 μl of water and heating for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were then re-chromatographed on the Superdex sizing column in the presence of size standards. To test for the presence of terminal nonreducing GlcNAc, β1,4-galactosyltransferase was used (25.Haltiwanger R.S. Grove K. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3611-3617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled peak (from Fig. 3 C) from Superdex size chromatography was pooled, dried in a Speed-Vac evaporator (Savant), and resuspended in 50 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, and 1 mmUDP-galactose. Bovine milk β1,4-galactosyltransferase (25 milliunits) was then added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by diluting the sample with 50 μl of water and heating for 5 min at 100 °C. The sample was then re-chromatographed on the Superdex sizing column in the presence of size standards. Charge analysis was performed essentially as described (20.Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). OS was either digested or mock-digested with sialidase (as described above). The resulting species were dried and resuspended in 500 μl of 2 mmTris-base. Samples were then passed through a 330-μl QAE-Sephadex column equilibrated in 2 mm Tris-base. Four fractions, 0.5 ml each, of stepwise increments of NaCl in 2 mm Tris-base was passed through the column and collected. The unbound fractions (0 mm NaCl) represent neutral species. Elution with increasing amounts of NaCl released species with negative charges: 20 mm NaCl, 1 negative charge; 70 mm NaCl, 2 negative charges; 100 mm NaCl, 3 negative charges; 140 mm NaCl, 4 negative charges; and 1 m NaCl, 5 or more negative charges. Flow-through and eluted radiolabel was monitored by scintillation counting. Saccharides were hydrolyzed in 2m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 2 h. The hydrolyzed samples were then dried in a Speed-Vac evaporator (Savant) and resuspended in water before analysis by high pH anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC). HPAEC was performed on a Dionex DX300 high performance liquid chromatography system equipped with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD-2 cell). Monosaccharide samples (after acid hydrolysis) were chromatographed on a CarboPac MA-1 column (Dionex) at 0.4 ml/min using the following gradient: 0–11 min, 0.1 mNaOH; 11–21 min, 0.1–0.7 m NaOH; 21–40 min, 0.7m NaOH. Radioactive samples were mixed with appropriate standards (1 nmol each fucitol, fucose, and glucose for [3H]fucose-labeled Lec1 samples or 1 nmol each galactosaminitol, glucose, glucitol, galactose, and galactitol for [3H]galactose-labeled Lec8 samples) before injection. Fractions (0.5–1 min) were collected and monitored for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Disaccharide samples were chromatographed on the MA-1 column at 0.4 ml/min isocratically at 0.1 m NaOH, collecting 0.25-min fractions. Standards were followed by pulsed amperometric detection. Immunoprecipitations, Western blots, peptideN-glycosidase F digestions, alkali-induced β-eliminations, and size fractionation of O-linked sugars on Pharmacia (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) Superdex columns were all performed essentially as described before (5.Moloney D.J.

Previous observations suggested to us that Notch1 is present in CHO cells and modified with O-linked fucose. To study O-linked fucose in CHO cells, we have used a CHO cell line that is deficient in the enzymeN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, called Lec1 (17.Stanley P. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27.Brüggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M. Cell. 1991; 64: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These cells are unable to synthesize complex or hybrid-typeN-linked glycans. Incorporation of [3H]fucose into N-linked glycans is significantly reduced in these cells and allows for a better observation of O-linked fucose saccharides (5.Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In a recent report, we metabolically labeled Lec1 cells with [3H]fucose and analyzed total Lec1 proteins by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (5.Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We observed a prominent band at approximately 200 kDa whose labeling was resistant to PNGase F, an enzyme that specifically removes N-linked glycans from protein. Notch1 is synthesized as an ∼300-kDa polypeptide that is proteolytically processed in the Golgi into two fragments, an ∼200-kDa extracellular domain (ECD) and an ∼110-kDa transmembrane/intracellular domain (T/ICD) (28.Blaumueller C.M. Qi H.L. Zagouras P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1997; 90: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) (see Fig.1 A). The two Notch1 fragments, ECD and the T/ICD, are held together by disulfide bonds to form the functional receptor. Because of the similarity of the molecular masses between the Notch1 ECD and the prominent 200-kDa band we observed in Lec1 cells, we decided to investigate if the band is the Notch1 ECD. To determine if Notch1 is expressed in the Lec1 cells, we analyzed Lec1 protein by Western blot using a Notch1-specific antibody, Na (23.Lu F.M. Lux S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5663-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A specific band that migrates at approximately 110 kDa was detected (Fig.1 B), consistent with the Notch T/ICD. Lower molecular weight species also appear on the blot but are commonly reported degradation fragments of Notch (29.Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The finding of Notch1 protein in Lec1 cell extracts was not surprising, since it has been reported that Notch1 is widely expressed in mammalian tissues (30.Kmiécik D. Herman V. Stroop C.J.M. Michalski J.C. Mir A.M. Labiau O. Verbert A. Cacan R. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since Notch1 was detected in Lec1 cells, we decided to see if it is modified with O-linked fucose, and if so, what form ofO-linked fucose it contains. Lec1 cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]fucose, and an immunoprecipitation using the Na antibody was performed. The immunoprecipitation specifically brought down a single-labeled band with mass approximately 200 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lane 1), the expected mass of the Notch1 ECD separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Because the two Notch1 fragments are held together by disulfide bonds, an immunoprecipitation using an antibody against the T/ICD is expected to precipitate both fragments, but only the ECD is expected to be labeled with [3H]fucose. The radiolabel was resistant to PNGase F digestion (Fig. 1 C, lane 2), suggesting that the Notch1 ECD is modified with O-linked fucose. There is a detectable shift in molecular mass of the ECD upon PNGase F digestion (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that Notch is also modified, as expected (31.Johansen K.M. Fehon R.G. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2427-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), withN-linked glycosylation. To confirm that Notch1 is modified withO-linked fucose and to analyze the size of the modification(s), the O-linked sugars were released from immunoprecipitated Notch1 protein (after PNGase F digestion) by alkali-induced β-elimination. The [3H]fucose-labeledO-linked carbohydrates were then analyzed by size chromatography. As shown in Fig.2 A, two major species were observed: a monosaccharide (MS) migrating at approximately one glucose-unit, and an OS. The MS peak was the predominant species and was identified as fucitol (Fig. 2 B) by HPAEC. The OS peak was subjected to acid hydrolysis (to break it down to monosaccharides) and then analyzed by HPAEC. The label in OS was also determined to be fucitol (Fig. 2 C). This indicates that both MS and OS are derived from O-linked fucose. During the β-elimination process, only the sugar that is directly attached to the protein becomes reduced to the alditol form of the sugar (e.g. fucose becomes fucitol). The ratio of MS to OS shown in Fig.2 A may suggest that only a few of the many predictedO-linked fucose sites contain elongated O-linked fucose, whereas most sites contain the monosaccharide. One of the minor peaks in Fig. 2 A (labeled *) contains [3H]fucitol (data not shown) and, based on the analysis below, probably represents an intermediate in the synthesis of OS. The two other minor peaks (labeled N) contain unreduced [3H]fucose (data not shown) and are believed to be residual N-glycans not released by PNGase F. To identify the structure of the O-linked fucose OS, we subjected it to sequencing by exoglycosidase digestions. OS was sensitive to an α2,3-specific sialidase treatment, causing a large shift in migration when re-analyzed by size chromatography (see Fig.3, A and B), indicating the removal of an α2,3-linked sialic acid. OS did not shift after treatment of β-galactosidase or β-hexosaminidase (data not shown). Charge analysis of the OS species demonstrated it to contain a single negative charge (i.e. a single sialic acid residue) (Fig. 3 E). The presence of the negatively charged sialic acid can have a hydration effect, which makes a glycan fractionate much larger than expected during size chromatography performed in water (32.Jacob G.S. Scudder P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This explains the aberrant size of the OS and the large shift upon removal of the sialic acid. The α2,3-linkage of the sialic acid is consistent with the fact that CHO cells express α2,3- but not α2,6-sialyltransferases (33.Hokke C.H. Bergwerff A.A. Van Dedem G.W.K. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 981-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Digestion of the sialidase product with Diplococcal β-galactosidase (specific for β1,4-galactose) caused a one glucose unit shift (Fig.3 C), indicating loss of a single β1,4-galactose. The sialidase product was not sensitive to β-hexosaminidase (data not shown). Digestion of the β-galactosidase product with jack bean β-hexosaminidase caused a two glucose unit shift (Fig.3 D), consistent with the removal of a single β-linkedN-acetylhexosamine (32.Jacob G.S. Scudder P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), yielding the final product, [3H]fucitol, migrating at approximately one glucose unit. The N-acetylhexosamine was demonstrated to be GlcNAc by incubating the β-galactosidase product with bovine milk galactosyltransferase and UDP-galactose. This resulted in an increase in size of one glucose unit (Fig. 3 G). Since galactosyltransferase will specifically add galactose to GlcNAc but not to GalNAc (26.Haltiwanger R.S. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), this indicates that the N-acetylhexosamine is GlcNAc and not GalNAc. The GlcNAc was shown to be linked to the 3′-hydroxyl of the fucose by demonstration that the disaccharide co-migrates with a GlcNAc-β1,3-fucitol standard under conditions that separate it from the two positional isomers (GlcNAc-β1,2-fucitol and GlcNAc-β1,4-fucitol, Fig. 3 H). Thus, the structure of the OS on Notch1 is the same as the O-linked fucose tetrasaccharide found on human clotting factor IX: Sia-α2,3-Gal-β1,4-GlcNAc-β1,3-Fuc. Once we knew that Notch1 was expressed in Lec1 cells and modified withO-linked fucose saccharides, we examined whether it was also modified with O-linked glucose. Since glucose can be interconverted to numerous other species such as amino acids in cells, results from metabolic radiolabeling with [3H]glucose can be difficult to interpret. To get around this problem, we labeled cells metabolically with [3H]galactose. When galactose is activated to UDP-galactose inside cells, a significant portion is epimerized to UDP-glucose (34.Varki A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 16-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This allows selective labeling of the UDP-glucose pool with tritium and minimal labeling of the glucose-6-phosphate pool in cells. To prevent incorporation of [3H]galactose into glycoproteins, we took advantage of a CHO cell line with a defect in UDP-galactose transport into the Golgi apparatus, Lec8 cells (19.Stanley P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, upon labeling Lec8 cells with [3H]galactose, the major radiolabeled species incorporated into proteins should be [3H]glucose. In a similar fashion to what was described for O-linked fucose, we tested for O-linked glucose on Notch1. First, we examined total cell protein from Lec8 cells radiolabeled as described. One of the major bands on the fluorograph migrates at approximately 200 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 1). Immunoprecipitation using the Na antibody revealed a single specific band of approximately 200 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 2), consistent with the Notch1 ECD. O-Linked sugars were then released from the immunoprecipitated, radiolabeled Notch1 protein by alkali-induced β-elimination as before. Size chromatography of the releasedO-linked sugars revealed a major species that migrates as a trisaccharide and a minor species that migrates as a monosaccharide (Fig. 5 A). The knownO-linked glucose-modified proteins were reported to be elongated with one or two xyloses to form either a di- or trisaccharide (6.Nishimura H. Kawabata S. Kisiel W. Hase S. Ikenaka T. Taka"
https://openalex.org/W2010670456,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein is stabilized in response to ionizing radiation and accumulates in the nucleus. Stabilization is thought to involve disruption of the interaction between the p53 protein and Mdm2, which targets p53 for degradation. Here we show that the direct association between a p53 N-terminal peptide and Mdm2 is disrupted by phosphorylation of the peptide on Thr18 but not by phosphorylation at other N-terminal sites, including Ser15 and Ser37. Thr18 was phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase (CK1); this process required the prior phosphorylation of Ser15. Thr18 was phosphorylated in vivo in response to DNA damage, and such phosphorylation required Ser15. Our results suggest that stabilization of p53 after ionizing radiation may result, in part, from an inhibition of Mdm2 binding through a phosphorylation-phosphorylation cascade involving DNA damage-activated phosphorylation of p53 Ser15 followed by phosphorylation of Thr18.

These responses are important for preserving the integrity of the genome of a cell, thus preventing the transformation of a normal cell into a tumor cell. p53 normally is a short-lived protein that is maintained at low levels in unstressed cells. After cells are exposed to DNA-damaging agents, nucleotide depletion, or hypoxia, the p53 protein is transiently stabilized and accumulates in the nucleus. DNA damage also activates p53 as a transcription factor, which in turn induces or represses the transcription of several genes, including WAF1 and MDM2, that regulate cell cycle progression. Both stabilization of the p53 protein and activation of its sequence-specific DNA binding ability are widely believed to be mediated, at least in part, by post-translational modifications to the p53 protein. p53 is phosphorylated on several sites in its N-terminal transactivation domain as well as on several sites in the C-terminal tetramerization/regulatory domain (4.Meek D.W. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and recent studies have shown that serines 15, 33, and 37 become phosphorylated after cells are exposed either to ionizing radiation (IR)1 or to UV light (5.Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar, 6.Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). In undamaged cells, p53 levels are low because the protein is rapidly degraded through a ubiquitin-mediated pathway (8.Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar, 9.Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar) that is mediated by the Mdm2, a protein that binds to the N terminus of p53 (10.Picksley S.M. Vojtesek B. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2523-2529PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P.

Recently, it was reported that incubating p53 with DNA-PK, a protein kinase activated by DNA strand breaks that phosphorylates human p53 in vitro on both Ser15 and Ser37 (13.Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), inhibited the binding of p53 to Mdm2 (5.Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar, 12.Honda R. Yasuda H.

Thus, phosphorylation of these sites in vivo may stabilize p53 by preventing Mdm2 binding. To test this prediction, we measured the binding constant for peptides corresponding to the N terminus of p53 and a human Mdm2 fragment that binds p53 (11.Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, phosphorylation of Ser15, of Ser37, or of both residues had only a small effect on the binding constant. Hence, either the inhibition of p53-Mdm2 binding by DNA-PK was not due to its phosphorylation of p53 or the observed effects were an indirect consequence of that phosphorylation. Here, we show that the latter explanation may be correct. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of Thr18 of p53 by casein kinase 1 (CK1) or a CK1-like activity is activated by phosphorylation of Ser15 and that this phosphorylation can account, in part, for the inhibition of p53 binding by Mdm2 observed after exposing cells to ionizing radiation. A549 (ATCC CCL-185), a human lung carcinoma cell line that expresses wild-type p53, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); NCI-H1299 (ATCC CRL-5803), a human lung carcinoma cell line that is null for both p53 alleles (15.Mitsudomi T. Steinberg S.M. Nau M.M. Carbone D., D., D.A. Bodner S. Oie H.K. Linnoila R.I. Mulshine J.L. Minna J.D. et al.Oncogene. 1992; 7: 171-180PubMed Google Scholar), was obtained from A. Fornace, Jr. (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Cells were grown to 50–70% confluency in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 nm glutamine in 150-mm dishes. Cultures were transfected with 10 μg of DNA/plate by the LipofectAMINE Plus procedure as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). One day after transfection, cultures were exposed to 8 gray by using a Shepherd Mark I 137Cs irradiator or treated with ALLN, a proteasome inhibitor, as described (7.Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). After the times indicated (see Fig. 3), cultures were harvested and processed for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Antibodies specific for p53 phosphorylated at Thr18 or Ser20 were prepared as described (7.Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Briefly, the PabSer(P)20 and PabThr(P)18 antibodies were made by immunizing rabbits with the p53 phosphopeptides Ac-15–26(20P)C (i.e.Ac-Ser-Gln-Glu-Thr-Phe-Ser(P)-Asp-Leu-Trp-Lys-Leu-Leu-Cys-NH2) or Ac-13–24(15, 18P)C (i.e.Ac-Pro-Leu-Ser(P)-Gln-Glu-Thr(P)-Phe-Ser-Asp-Leu-Trp-Lys-Cys-NH2) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, respectively. Phosphorylation site-specific antibodies were affinity purified from the resulting serum using the corresponding phosphorylated peptides attached to SulfoLink (Pierce). In the case of PabThr(P)18, the antibody was depleted of Ser15(P) cross-reacting activity by also passing the preparation through a column of Ac-p53(13–24)(15P)C attached to SulfoLink. The antibody to p53 phosphorylated at Ser15 was made by immunizing a rabbit with the peptide human p53(13–19(15F2Pab))A(13–19(15F2Pab))AC coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, i.e.PL(F2Pab)QETAPL(F2Pab)QETAC-KLH. F2Pab is a phosphoserine mimetic (16.Otaka A. Miyoshi K., T.R. Burke J. Roller P.P. Kubota H. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 927-930Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and was incorporated as the BOC-F2Pab(OEt2-OH) derivative. Phosphoserine 15-specific antibodies were purified using the natural phosphopeptide (p53(Ac-11–22(15P)Cys)-SulfoLink conjugate. Peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method with Fmoc chemistry using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 430A peptide synthesizer. Phosphoserine was incorporated as Fmoc-Ser(PO(OBzl)OH)-OH, and phosphothreonine was incorporated as Fmoc-Thr(PO(OBzl)OH)-OH (Novabiochem, San Diego, CA). Peptide p53(15–29) was labeled with 5-carboxyfluorescein, succinimidyl ester (Pierce) on the resin. Peptides were cleaved from the resin, and side chain protecting groups were removed by incubating in reagent K (trifluoroacetic acid:phenol:thioanisole:H2O:EDT, 82.5:5:5:5:2.5) for 3 h at room temperature. The p53(1–39) peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a pH-stable Vydac C-8 column (Hesperia, CA) with 0.2% hexafluoroacetone-NH4OH, pH 7.0, acetonitrile. The masses of peptides were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Finnigan MAT SSQ 7000 (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA). The dissociation constants (K d) for unlabeled p53 peptides from the Mdm2 fragment were determined by a competition assay with fluorescein-labeled p53(15–29) in 25 mm MES, pH6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4°C (17.Heyduk T. Ma Y. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18.Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Fluorescence anisotropy was measured in a PanVera Beacon 2000 instrument with temperature control (PanVera Corporation, Madison, WI). Binding constants were determined as follows. The binding constant of the labeled peptide was first determined by titrating 50 nm fluorescein-labeled p53(15–29) with increasing amounts of Mdm2(17–125) and measuring the fluorescence anisotropy at each concentration. In separate experiments, 50 nm of fluorescein labeled p53(15–29) was mixed with several different concentrations of unlabeled peptides, and these mixtures were titrated with the Mdm2 fragment. Fluorescence anisotropy was recorded at each concentration. The binding constant of the fluoresceinated p53(15–29) peptide was determined by fitting to a single site binding equation using either SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc., San Rafael, CA) or a BASIC program written by the authors. For the competition assays, binding isotherms at three concentrations were simultaneously fitted by a global-fit program developed by the authors to the following equations.Aobs=Af+(Ac−Af)[P*M]/[P*] TEquation 1 [P*M]=K*[P*] TX/(1+K*·X)Equation 2 X=(((1+K[P] T−K[M] T) 2Equation 3 +4·K[M] T) 1/2−(1+K[P] T−K[M] T))/2K A f is the anisotropy of the free labeled peptide, A c is the anisotropy of the labeled peptide-Mdm2 complex, A obs is the observed anisotropy, K* is the association constant of the labeled peptide with the Mdm2 fragment, K is the association constant of the unlabeled peptide with the Mdm2 fragment, [P*]T is the total concentration of labeled peptide, [P]T is the total concentration of unlabeled competing peptide, [P*M] is the concentration of the labeled peptide-Mdm2 complex, and [M]T is the total concentration of Mdm2 fragment. These equations were derived from the Weber average formula (19.Weber G. Biochem. J. 1952; 51: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) and the mass action law, assuming that [M]f + [PM] ≫ [P*M], where [M]f is the free Mdm2 fragment concentration and [PM] is the concentration of the unlabeled peptide-Mdm2 fragment complex. Because of the concentration of the labeled peptide used and the affinity constants, such an assumption is fully justified. The p53(Ac-1–24) peptides at 200 μm were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with recombinant CK1-δ (New England BioLabs) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 μm ATP containing [γ-32P]ATP. The32P-labeled peptides were separated by chromatography inn-butanol:prydine:acetic acid:water (3:2:1:4) on cellulose TLC plates (Merck). A recombinant fusion protein, N47 (20.Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar), containing residues 2–47 of human p53, at 38 μm was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with DNA-PK (Promega) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm ATP, and 10 μg/ml calf thymus DNA. The reactants then were diluted into an equal volume of a CK1-δ reaction as described above, but without peptide, and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (21.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared, and Western immunoblots were performed essentially as described (7.Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar); however, in place of immunoprecipitation with protein G-Sepharose, p53 was collected by centrifugation with a 1:1 mixture of PAb1801- and DO-1-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). 5 μg of each antibody conjugate was used for 1300 μg of extract protein; after incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times by centrifugation. To avoid possible interference by the IgG heavy chain, the reducing agent was omitted from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. To examine directly the effect of N-terminal phosphorylation on the interaction of p53 and Mdm2, we determined the dissociation constants for various phosphorylated p53(1–39) peptides with Mdm2(17–125) by measuring the changes in fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein-labeled p53(15–29) complexed with Mdm2(17–125) in response to added p53(1–39) (Fig.1 and TableI). Different amounts of Mdm2 were added to mixtures of the fluorescein-labeled probe and p53(1–39) or p53(1–39) phosphorylated at different positions. The dissociation constant for each peptide with Mdm2 then was determined by fitting the curves using a mathematical model (see “Experimental Procedures”). Unphosphorylated p53(1–39) bound Mdm2 with an apparent dissociation constant of 70 ± 20 nm (Fig. 1 A), whereas p53(1–39) with Ala-Ala replacing Leu22-Trp23exhibited no measurable binding (Fig. 1 D). Surprisingly, p53(1–39) phosphorylated on Ser15 (Fig. 1 B), on Ser37 or on both residues had dissociation constants that were only slightly higher (60–260 nm) on average than the unphosphorylated peptide (Table I). Phosphorylation of the p53 N-terminal peptide on Ser9, Ser20, Ser33, or Ser15 and Ser20 also only slightly affected the interaction of p53 and Mdm2. In contrast, phosphorylation of Thr18 or of Thr18 and Ser15 (Fig. 1 C) dramatically reduced the association (∼30–50-fold). Contrary to previous reports, these data suggest that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and Ser37 does not directly inhibit formation of the p53-Mdm2 complex; rather, phosphorylation of Thr18, which stabilizes the association with Mdm2 through hydrogen bonding of the threonine hydroxyl group (11.Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar), appears to be crucial.Table IBinding affinity of p53(1–39) peptides with Mdm2(17–125)PeptideaHuman p53(1–39) peptides phosphorylated at the site or sites indicated.K dbThe apparent dissociation constants were determined from measurements of the fluorescence anisotropy (see “Experimental Procedures”).±S.D.cEach value is the average of at least three determinations.

Open table in a new tab To explore the question of its phosphorylation, we prepared an antibody that specifically recognizes p53 only when it is phosphorylated on Thr18; we also made antibodies that recognize p53 only when it is phosphorylated on Ser15 or on Ser20. The specificities of these antibodies for p53 phosphorylated at the respective sites were confirmed by peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and/or by peptide dot-blot assays as reported recently for other p53 phosphorylation-specific antibodies (7.Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the specificity of the p53 phospho-Thr18 antiserum as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antiserum recognized the p53(1–39) peptide phosphorylated on Thr18 alone or on Thr18 and Ser15. It also recognized a p53(Ac-13–24) peptide phosphorylated at Thr18 and Ser20, although not so well. It did not recognize the unphosphorylated p53(1–39) peptide, the peptide with Ser15 changed to alanine, the p53(1–39) peptide phosphorylated at Ser15, the peptide phosphorylated at both Ser15 and Ser20, nor several other control peptides; however, the antibody did recognize the p53(1–39) peptide with Ser15 changed to alanine and Thr18phosphorylated (data not shown). These data show that the PAbThr(P)18 antiserum specifically recognizes p53 when phosphorylated on Thr18 but not on other N-terminal p53 phosphorylation sites; its recognition is not abrogated by phosphorylation at Ser15 or Ser20 nor by changing Ser15 to another amino acid. Fig. 3 shows that p53 Thr18was not detectably phosphorylated in unirradiated A549 cells nor in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor ALLN, which stabilizes p53 (22.Dietrich C. Bartsch T. Schanz F. Oesch F. Wieser R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10815-10819Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), as seen with DO-1, a monoclonal antibody specific for the N terminus of p53. However, after cells were exposed to 8 gray of γ-irradiation, a dramatic, transient phosphorylation of Thr18 was observed by 45 min that peaked 2 h after exposure and disappeared between 8 and 24 h. Ser20also was phosphorylated after IR with similar initial kinetics, but it remained phosphorylated at 24 h. As shown previously (5.Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar, 6.Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Ser15 is rapidly induced by IR and was seen within 45 min of exposure; phosphorylation peaked at 2 h and then slowly declined (Fig. 3). Similar to Thr18, Ser15, or Ser20 were not phosphorylated in unirradiated A549 cells nor in cells treated with ALLN. These results show that Thr18 and Ser20 at the N terminus of p53, like Ser15, Ser33, and Ser37, are phosphorylated in response to DNA damage. We caution, however, that in WS1, a human embryonic skin fibroblast cell line (ATTC CRL-1502), and in normal adult human fibroblasts, phosphorylation of Thr18 appeared significantly weaker than in A549 cells even though good phosphorylation at Ser15 was observed after exposure to ionizing radiation (data not shown). This finding suggests that the role of Thr18 phosphorylation may be cell type-specific. The N terminus of mouse p53 is phosphorylated by CK1 (23.Milne D.M. Palmer R.H. Campbell D.G. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1361-1369PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Knippschild U. Milne D.M. Campbell L.E. DeMaggio A.J. Christenson E. Hoekstra M.F. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a ubiquitously expressed protein kinase, the specificity of which can be directed to specific serines and threonines by phosphorylation at the −3 position (25.Flotow H.

Thr18 lies three residues downstream of Ser15 and is followed by Phe19. To ascertain whether CK1 can phosphorylate Thr18, we incubated recombinant human CK1-δ with p53(Ac-1–24) or p53(Ac-1–24) phosphorylated at Ser15, Ser9, and Ser15, or at Ser15 with Thr18, Ser6, Ser9, or Thr18 and Ser20 changed to Ala (Fig.4 A). Little or no phosphorylation was observed unless Ser15 was phosphorylated and Thr18 was present, indicating thatin vitro prior phosphorylation of Ser15specifically activates phosphorylation of Thr18 by CK1. Phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed that Thr18 is the major target for phosphorylation by CK1 (Fig. 4 B). Phosphorylation of Thr18 also was potentiated by prior phosphorylation of an N-terminal p53 fusion protein with DNA-PK (Fig.4 C); without phosphorylation by DNA-PK, Thr18was not phosphorylated by CK1, as shown by immunoblot analysis with the PAbThr(P)18 antibody. If CK1 is responsible for phosphorylating Thr18 in vivo, then this process also should depend on the phosphorylation of Ser15. To address this question, we transfected H1299 lung carcinoma cells, which do not express p53 (15.Mitsudomi T. Steinberg S.M. Nau M.M. Carbone D., D., D.A. Bodner S. Oie H.K. Linnoila R.I. Mulshine J.L. Minna J.D. et al.Oncogene. 1992; 7: 171-180PubMed Google Scholar), with p53 expression vectors for wild-type human p53 or p53 mutated to change Ser15 or Ser37 to Ala (28.Fiscella M. Ullrich S.J. Zambrano N. Shields M.T. Lin D. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Mercer W.E. Appella E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1519-1528PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then either irradiated or not, and extracts were processed for immunoblot analysis with the PAbThr(P)18 antibody. Phosphorylation of Thr18 clearly was observed in H1299 cells transfected with wild-type p53 or with p53 that had Ser37 changed to Ala but not in cells transfected with p53 that had Ser15 changed to Ala (Fig.5). In contrast, Ser20 was phosphorylated in both mutants. No phosphorylation signal was observed from cells transfected with the vector alone. In contrast to endogenous p53 in A549 cells (Fig. 3), phosphorylation of p53 at Ser20and Thr18 in transfected cells was only stimulated by and not dependent on the intentionally applied DNA damage (Fig. 5). We believe that in this case phosphorylation may be induced by the process of transfection or by DNA breaks present in the transfected DNA (29.Bulavin D. Saito S.-i. Hollander M.C. Sakaguchi K. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Fornace J., A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6845-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In vitro, Ser15 can be phosphorylated by DNA-PK (13.Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K.

Genet. 1997; 31: 635-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In vivoefficient phosphorylation of Ser15 after exposing cells to IR requires a functional ATM gene (6.Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), and in ATM-deficient cells, the accumulation of p53 in response to IR also is delayed (33.Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser15 is important for stabilizing p53. An important mechanism that regulates p53 stability is its binding to Mdm2, which targets p53 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In contrast to other reports (5.Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar, 12.Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 14.Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6348-6355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Craig A.L. Burch L. Vojtesek B. Mikutowska J. Thompson A. Hupp T.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), our data suggest that Ser15 phosphorylation indirectly affects the association of p53 with Mdm2 rather than directly (Fig.6). Compared with the unphosphorylated peptide, the association of p53 N-terminal peptides phosphorylated at Ser15, Ser37, or both, with Mdm2(17–125) was barely reduced. Importantly, however, this association was dramatically inhibited by phosphorylation at Thr18 (Table I). The crystal structure of Mdm2(17–125) with the N terminus of p53 shows that p53 residues 18–26 form an amphipathic helix that fits into a deep hydrophobic groove in the Mdm2 structure (11.Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonds made by the side chain hydroxyl of Thr18 with a backbone amide and the side chain carboxyl group of Asp21 of p53 contribute to stabilizing the helical structure of this segment. Phosphorylation of Thr18 would eliminate these bonds and introduce a charge-charge repulsion with Asp21 that would further destabilize the p53-Mdm2 interaction. In contrast, Ser15 and Ser37 lie outside the region of direct contact determined from the crystal structure. Thus, structural considerations support a role for Thr18 phosphorylation in inhibiting the association between p53 and Mdm2. While this report was in preparation, Böttger et al. (35.Böttger V. Böttger A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Ramos Y.F.M. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) reported that phosphorylation of Thr18 or replacement of this threonine by amino acids other than serine substantially decreased the interaction of p53 N-terminal peptides with GST-Mdm2, in agreement with the results reported here. Moreover, Craig et al. (34.Craig A.L. Burch L. Vojtesek B. Mikutowska J. Thompson A. Hupp T.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) recently reported that monoclonal antibodies specific for phosphorylated Thr18 detected p53 in human breast cancers with elevated p53. They also found that a peptide phosphorylated at Thr18 inhibited p53 binding by Mdm2. CK1-δ and CK1-ε are closely related, ubiquitously expressed mammalian homologs of budding yeast Hrr25, a nuclear Ser/Thr protein kinase that was isolated in a screen for mutants sensitive to double-stranded breaks (36.Graves P.R.

Yeast HRR25 mutants are defective in the transcriptional induction of a subset of DNA damage-inducible genes that require Swi6, a transcription factor phosphorylated by Hrr25 in vitro (39.Ho Y. Mason S. Kobayashi R. Hoekstra M. Andrews B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Murine CK1 phosphorylates several residues at the N terminus of mouse p53 (23.Milne D.M. Palmer R.H. Campbell D.G. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1361-1369PubMed Google Scholar,24.Knippschild U. Milne D.M. Campbell L.E. DeMaggio A.J. Christenson E. Hoekstra M.F. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), but these residues are not completely conserved in human p53, and our attempts to phosphorylate the N terminus of unmodified human p53 with recombinant CK1-δ were unsuccessful (Fig. 4). In contrast to unmodified p53, p53(1–24) phosphorylated at Ser15 but not Ser9, and recombinant p53(2–47) phosphorylated at Ser15 and Ser37 with DNA-PK were efficiently phosphorylated by CK1 in vitro. These results are in keeping with the known ability of phosphoserine at the −3 position to potentiate phosphorylation by CK1 (25.Flotow H. Graves P.R. Wang A. Fiol C.J. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14264-14269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser15 is an early event in response to IR (5.Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar, 6.Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3), and CK1 isoforms are ubiquitously expressed; thus, CK1 is a likely candidate for phosphorylating p53 Thr18 in vivo. Consistent with this possibility, we found that phosphorylation of Thr18 in response to DNA damage required the presence of Ser15. Curiously, this experiment also revealed that mutation of Ser37 to alanine enhanced the level of phosphorylation at Thr18, Ser15, and Ser20 (Fig. 5). The reason for this enhancement is not known but presumably reflects changes in substrate recognition for the kinases or phosphatases that control these phosphorylations and that are either dependent on Ser37 itself or modulated by its phosphorylation. This and other recent observations indicate that there is a complex interplay between different N-terminal phosphorylation sites. For example, we recently reported that changing Ser33 to alanine unexpectedly decreased phosphorylation levels of Ser15 and Ser37 (29.Bulavin D. Saito S.-i. Hollander M.C. Sakaguchi K. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Fornace J., A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6845-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr18 certainly is not the only mechanism for stabilizing p53. Phosphorylation of Thr18after exposure to IR is transient, peaking at about 2 h (Fig. 3), and this time course is not completely coincident with p53 accumulation. Recently, Ashcroft et al. (40.Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H.G. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and Blattneret al. (41.Blattner C. Tobiasch E. Litfen M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) reported that p53 mutated to change several phosphorylation sites including Thr18 to alanine is still stabilized after exposure to DNA damage-inducing agents. We therefore postulate that DNA damage-induced modifications to Mdm2 (42.Mayo L.D. Turchi J.J. Berberich S.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5013-5016PubMed Google Scholar) or other components of the targeting system may contribute to stabilizing p53. Furthermore, transfection of HCT-116 p53−/− cells with increasing amounts of Mdm2 expressing plasmid did not differentially affect the stability of wild-type p53 compared with p53-S15A or p53-T18A (data not shown). Thus, under these conditions, phosphorylation of Thr18 is not the dominant regulator of p53 stability. Given the central role of p53 in integrating stress-related signals and the apparent multiple mechanisms of activating p53 sequence-specific DNA binding (2.Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 3.Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), the existence of redundant mechanisms for stabilizing p53 would not be surprising. In other cell types or under other circumstances, phosphorylation of Thr18 could play a more important role. Phosphorylation of Thr18 and other sites at the N terminus of p53 also may regulate the interaction of p53 with other cellular proteins, such as CBP/p300, TFIIH, the TAFs, RPA, and JNK (Fig. 6), and in many cells, the regulation of such interactions may be more important. Investigations of these possibilities are in progress. We are grateful to Cynthia Pise-Masison and Dmitry V. Bulavin for advice and help with transient transfections and to Paul H. Kussie for providing purified recombinant human Mdm2(17–125)."
https://openalex.org/W2043978867,"There are at least two distinct classes of caspases, initiators (e.g. caspases-8, -9, and -10) and effectors (e.g. caspase-3). Furthermore, it is believed that there are two distinct primary apoptotic signaling pathways, one of which is mediated by death receptors controlled by caspases-8/10, and the other by the release of cytochrome c and activation of a caspase-9/Apaf1/cytochrome c apoptosome. However, several recent reports have demonstrated that caspase-8, and its substrate Bid, are frequently activated in response to certain apoptotic stimuli in a death receptor-independent manner. These results suggest that significant cross-talk may exist between these two distinct signaling arms, allowing each to take advantage of elements unique to the other. Here we provide evidence that activation of caspase-8, and subsequent Bid cleavage, does indeed participate in cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis, at least in certain circumstances and cell types. Furthermore, the participation of activated caspase-3 is essential for activation of caspase-8 and Bid processing to occur. Although caspase-8 activation is not required for the execution of a cytochrome c-mediated death signal, we found that it greatly shortens the execution time. Thus, caspase-8 involvement in cytochrome c-mediated cell death may help to amplify weaker death signals and ensure that apoptosis occurs within a certain time frame."

J., Battaglioli, E., Anderson, M. E., Grimes, J., Dallmanm J., Ballas, N., and Mandel, G. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 9873–9878). Here we show that the co-repressor mSin3A also interacts with REST. The REST-mSin3A association involves the NH2-terminal repressor domain of REST and the paired amphipathic helix 2 domain of mSin3A. REST forms complexes with endogenous mSin3A in mammalian cells, and both mSin3A and CoREST interact with REST in intact mammalian cells. REST repression is blocked in yeast lacking Sin3 and rescued in its presence. In mammalian cells, repression by REST is reduced when binding to mSin3A is inhibited. In mouse embryos, the distribution of mSin3A and REST transcripts is largely coincident. The pattern of CoREST gene expression is more restricted, suggesting that mSin3A is required constitutively for REST repression, whereas CoREST is recruited for more specialized repressor functions.

Because of its importance in establishing and maintaining the expression pattern of a large number of genes required for neuronal functioning, it was of interest to identify the molecules involved in the repressor mechanism. Previous studies identified two distinct domains in the NH2and COOH termini of REST that were both necessary and sufficient to repress brain type II sodium channel reporter genes in transient transfection assays (7.Tapia-Ramirez J. Eggen B.J.L. Peral-Rubio M.J. Toledo-Aral J.J. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and showed that repression by each of these two domains required distinct titratable factors (8.Leichter M. Thiel G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recently, repression from the COOH-terminal domain was determined to be mediated by the co-repressor, CoREST (1.Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallmanm J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether, in addition to CoREST, mSin3A, a co-repressor for several regulated repressor complexes, might also be involved in REST repression. We found that mSin3A is indeed a functional co-repressor for REST. mSin3A interacts with REST in vitro, in yeast and in intact mammalian cells, and interestingly, the binding site maps to the NH2-terminal repressor domain in REST. Furthermore, experiments both in yeast and mammalian cells showed that mSin3A is involved in repressor function. In vivo, the expression patterns of the co-repressors mSin3A and CoREST are distinct. Specifically, in early embryogenesis CoREST exhibits a much more restricted pattern of expression compared with REST and mSin3A, suggesting that the composition of the REST repressor complex during development is dynamic. LexA-mSin3A was obtained by cloning full-length mSin3A into pBTM116 by standard PCR1 cloning techniques. pGADmSin3A was made by cloning full-length mSin3A (provided by Carol Laherty and Bob Eisenman, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) into pGADGH (donated by Rolf Sternglanz, SUNY, Stony Brook, NY) using standard PCR-based cloning techniques. pGADNmSin3A was obtained by cloning a restriction fragment encoding the first 530 amino acids of mSin3A into pGADGH. To make a fusion between full-length CoREST and the LexA DNA binding domain, a 3030-base pairNaeI–PstI fragment from pcDNA1.1CoREST (1.Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E.

A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) was cloned between the SmaI and PstI sites of the vector pBTM to generate pBTMCoREST. A fusion of the LexA DNA binding domain to amino acids 102–482 of CoREST has been described previously (1.Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallmanm J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A fusion of the LexA DNA binding domain to amino acids 1–293 of CoREST was made by cloning an EcoRI/EcoRI fragment of Gal4-CoREST (amino acids 1–293) 2N. Ballas, unpublished. into pBTM. Fusions between the LexA DNA binding domain and the amino or carboxyl portions of REST (N-REST and C-REST, respectively) have been described previously (1.Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallmanm J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). GST-REST-(32–122) was made by subcloning anEcoRI/BamHI fragment of VP16 REST (obtained in the two-hybrid screen) into pGEX-3X. An NH2-terminal FLAG epitope was added to REST by cloning it into pCMV-Tag1 (Stratagene) by standard PCR-based cloning techniques. To generate RESTΔNLS FLAG, nucleotides 1535–1566 (encoding the consensus NLS) of REST-FLAG were removed and replaced with a BamHI site by PCR, and the RESTΔNLS FLAG coding sequence was subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). The pTet-On plasmid was purchased fromCLONTECH, and the tetracycline-inducible REST expression vector, pTRE-REST, was made by cloning REST-FLAG into pTRE (CLONTECH) at the EcoRI site. To generate REST Myc, the coding sequence of REST was cloned into pcDNA3.1(−) Myc-His A (Invitrogen) by standard PCR-based cloning techniques. mSin3A Myc was generously donated by Carol Laherty and Bob Eisenman. CoREST Myc has been described previously (1.Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallmanm J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The RE1-containing type II sodium channel reporter gene, pSDK7, has been described previously (9.Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsay H.J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing a 1.1-kilobase pair cDNA fragment spanning the zinc finger DNA binding domain of mouse REST (mREST in pBluescript) has been described previously (2.Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohmann M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Linearization of this plasmid with EcoRI and transcription with T7 RNA polymerase were used to generate antisense transcripts, while digestion with KpnI and transcription with T3 RNA polymerase were used to generate sense transcripts. A mouse expressed sequence tag containing a 1.3-kilobase pair insert spanning the entire open reading frame of CoREST (identified by homology with human CoREST) was purchased from Genome Systems Inc. Linearization withBamHI and transcription with T7 RNA polymerase yielded the antisense transcript, while digestion with XhoI and transcription with T3 RNA polymerase yielded a sense transcript. An 800-base pair NsiI/HindIII fragment spanning amino acids 274–533 of mSin3A was cloned into pBluescript II KS. Antisense and sense riboprobes were transcribed from plasmids linearized with SpeI or EcoRI, using T7 and T3 RNA polymerases, respectively. All fusion protein constructs were sequenced across the junction to ensure that inserts were in frame. All constructs generated by PCR were sequenced completely. pBTM116-Sin3A was transformed into L40 yeast together with a mouse 9.5–10.5 days postcoitum cDNA library ligated into pVP16 as described (10.Lavender P. Vandel L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2721-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An estimated 5 × 106 transformants were screened. Proteins interacting with mSin3A were identified by growth on selective medium in the presence of 5 mm3-aminotriazole and confirmed by assaying for β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids rescued from positive yeast colonies were retransformed into L40 together with either pBTM116-mSin3A or pBTM116-lamin to assess the specificity of the interaction. Positively interacting clones were characterized by sequence analysis. Direct yeast interaction assays were performed using yeast transformed with either LexA-REST, LexA-NREST, or LexA-CREST and either pGAD-mSin3A, pGAD-NmSin3A, or pGAD-CoREST. Activity of HIS3 andLacZ reporter genes was used to identify positive interactions. Expression and purification of GST-fusion proteins and GST pull-down assays were performed as described (11.Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1243-1250PubMed Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription/translation was performed using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based TnT system from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. The in vitro translatable mSin3A deletion series in pCS2 + MT was kindly provided by Carol Laherty and Bob Eisenman. HEK-293 cells were grown as described previously (1.Andres M.E. Burger C.

A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and transfected with pTetOn and pTRE-REST-FLAG using Fugene transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The tetracycline analogue doxycycline was added to the medium to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml to induce expression of REST. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer H (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml antitrypsin, aprotinin, and leupeptin) and passed through a 25-gauge needle five times. Following centrifugation, the nuclear pellet was resuspended and rotated for 20 min at 4 °C in buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml antitrypsin, aprotinin, and leupeptin). After centrifugation, the supernatant consisting of nuclear proteins was diluted to create immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 8.9% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml antitrypsin, aprotinin, and leupeptin). 400-μg aliquots of nuclear extract were precleared by rotating at 4 °C for 5 h with 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5 μg of preimmune rabbit IgG. Nuclear extracts were then recovered by centrifugation and added to 20 μl of fresh protein G-agarose beads and 5 μg of the appropriate polyclonal antibodies for immunoprecipitation. The antibodies used were anti-REST (2.Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohmann M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G.

Samples were immunoprecipitated by rotation overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed 3 times in high salt immunoprecipitation buffer (250 mm NaCl), and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting was performed using a monoclonal anti-FLAG M5 antibody (Sigma) and the K-20 mSin3A antibody. COS-1 cells were cultured as described previously (7.Tapia-Ramirez J. Eggen B.J.L. Peral-Rubio M.J. Toledo-Aral J.J. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After plating on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, cells were transfected with FLAG and Myc epitope-tagged expression constructs using Fugene transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 10 min. Cells were then washed four times in PBS, permeabilized for 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100-PBS (PBST), and incubated for 1 h in 5% nonfat powdered milk in PBST. Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h in anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), both at a 1:500 dilution. Cells were washed four times in PBST before incubating in Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes), both at a dilution of 1:1000, for 1 h in the dark. Coverslips were then washed four times in PBST and once in PBS and mounted in Vectashield H-1000 (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Cells were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Yeast wild type (WT) and Sin3 deletion strains (DY1641 and DY2516, respectively (12.Wang H. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)) were transformed with pMN-REST, pRS313-Sin3 (M1635; Ref. 13.Kasten M.M. Ayer D.E. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4215-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), or the corresponding empty expression constructs. Both yeast strains contain an integrated LexA-LacZ reporter so that repression by Lex-REST expressed from pMN-REST can be assessed by monitoring β-galactosidase activity. HEK293 cells were grown as described previously (1.Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallmanm J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and transfected using Fugene (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of the type II sodium channel CAT reporter gene, pSDK7. Cells were also transfected with either 0.5 μg of the “competitor” Gal4F4 or an equimolar amount of the empty Gal4 vector and either 0.5 μg of mSin3A or an equimolar amount of the empty vector pCS2 + MT. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. CAT assays were performed as described previously (7.Tapia-Ramirez J. Eggen B.J.L. Peral-Rubio M.J. Toledo-Aral J.J. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Digoxygenin-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were generated using a digoxygenin RNA labeling kit (SP6/T7; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), treated with DNase, and purified on G50 Sepharose columns. Embryos were collected from CD-1 mice at embryonic days 8.5 and 11.5. Whole mount embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS with 2 mm EGTA, “bleached” in 6% H2O2 in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, and stored at −20 °C in absolute methanol until used for hybridization. Embryos for paraffin embedding were fixed in Bouin's solution, dehydrated, cleared, embedded in Paraplast, and serially sectioned at 8 μm. Whole mount hybridization was carried out as described previously (14.Wilkinsin D.G. In Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992Google Scholar). Paraffin-sectioned material was hybridized with a modification of the method of Hockfield et al. (15.Hockfield S. Carlson S. Evans C. Levitt P. Pintar J. Silberstein L. Molecular Probes of the Nervous System. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). In brief, sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, proteinase K (10 μg/ml in PBS with Tween)-treated, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, acetylated in 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine, dehydrated, and dried before hybridization. Sections were hybridized overnight at 50 °C in hybridization buffer (0.6 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1× Denhardt's reagent, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% sheared herring sperm DNA, 0.05% yeast total RNA, 0.005% yeast tRNA, 50% formamide, and 10% dextran sulfate) containing a minimum of 0.4 ng/μl/kilobase of cRNA probe. Hybridization signals were detected using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibody to digoxygenin and visualized with the chromogen nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. In a yeast two-hybrid screen in which mSin3A was used as the bait, three cDNAs out of a total of 20 sequenced represented REST fragments. Two cDNAs encoded amino acids 32–122 of REST, and one cDNA encoded amino acids 8–135. To test whether the mSin3A interaction was specific for the NH2 terminus of REST, two LexA-REST fusion proteins were generated, one encoding amino acids 1–525 (N-REST), and the other encoding amino acids 525–1097 (C-REST). The pGAD-mSin3A proteins interacted only with N-REST (Fig.1). Unfortunately, LexA-full-length REST was not stable in yeast, and therefore we were unable to demonstrate interaction of full-length REST with mSin3A using this system. The mSin3A-interacting domain of REST overlapped with a domain that was shown previously to be required and sufficient for repression of type II sodium channel reporter genes (7.Tapia-Ramirez J. Eggen B.J.L. Peral-Rubio M.J. Toledo-Aral J.J. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine whether mSin3A might also interact with the co-repressor that mediates repression from the COOH-terminal repressor domain of REST, CoREST, further two hybrid analyses were performed (Fig. 1). No interactions were observed between mSin3A or an NH2-terminal fragment of mSin3A, with either full-length CoREST (Fig. 1) or NH2-terminal (amino acids 1–293) and COOH-terminal (amino acids 101–482) fragments of CoREST (data not shown). The mSin3A co-repressor contains four domains that mediate protein-protein interactions, and three of the domains (PAH1–3) are clustered at the NH2 terminus of the protein. A yeast interaction assay using pGAD N-mSin3A showed that the interaction of REST was also through the NH2 terminus of mSin3A (Fig. 1). To further characterize the interaction, an in vitro binding assay was performed. A GST fusion protein containing amino acids 32–122 of REST was expressed in bacteria and then purified and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. In vitrotranslated mSin3A protein, labeled with [35S]methionine, bound to a GST-retinoblastoma protein column used as a positive control (16.Tokitou F. Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Yasukawa T. Khono I. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4485-4488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled mSin3A protein also bound to a GST-REST-(32–122) column but not to GST alone (Fig.2). Analysis of binding of truncated mSin3A products showed that REST interacts with amino acids 205–479 of mSin3A, corresponding to a region containing the paired amphipathic helix domain 2 (PAH-2; Fig. 2). The interactions between REST and mSin3A observed in the yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro were confirmed in mammalian cells using two approaches. First, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using nuclear extracts from HEK-293 cells overexpressing REST-FLAG under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. FLAG epitopes were present in immunoprecipitates using REST, CoREST, and mSin3A K-20 antibodies but not in immunoprecipitates using mSin3A AK-11 antibody or preimmune IgG (Fig.3). Conversely, mSin3A was present in immunoprecipitates using REST, CoREST, and mSin3A antibodies (both K-20 and AK-11; Fig. 3). Given that the AK-11 antibodies recognize the PAH-2 domain in mSin3A, while the K-20 antibodies recognize epitopes in the mSin3A amino terminus, these results are consistent with the GST pull-down experiments above indicating REST interaction through the mSin3A PAH-2 domain. Second, REST interacted with CoREST and mSin3A overexpressed in intact mammalian cells. In these studies, an epitope-tagged version of REST cDNA lacking a nuclear localization signal (RESTΔNLS-FLAG) was transfected into COS-1 cells. In contrast to WT REST, which is restricted to the nucleus, RESTΔNLS-FLAG was predominantly cytoplasmic, as visualized by immunocytochemistry using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4). The mutated REST protein caused a dramatic redistribution of both CoREST- and mSin3A-myc fusion proteins to the cytoplasm, whereas they were both strictly nuclear in the presence of WT REST (Fig. 4). Quantitation of the data indicated that mSin3A-myc was redirected to the cytoplasm in 98% of cells expressing RESTΔNLS-FLAG (n = 50). Furthermore, the proteins appeared to co-localize within aggregates in the cytoplasm, indicated by the superimposition of the fluorescence (Fig.4). Similarly, in 96% of cells expressing RESTΔNLS-FLAG in the cytoplasm, CoREST-myc was found in the cytoplasm (n = 50). To eliminate the possibility that there was a fortuitous interaction of the epitopes or that overexpression of the proteinsper se led to coincidental co-localization in the cytoplasm, RESTΔNLS-FLAG was co-transfected with cDNA coding for WT REST-myc. In this case, in 100% of the cells that showed cytoplasmic FLAG staining, REST-myc immunostaining remained strictly nuclear (n = 50). The finding that mSin3A binds to REST through its NH2-terminal repressor domain suggested to us that mSin3A could function as a co-repressor for REST. To test this idea, functional experiments were performed in both yeast and mammalian cells. In a WT yeast strain, expression of the NH2 terminus of REST fused to the LexA DNA binding domain (LexA N-REST) resulted in complete repression of a LexA-βGal reporter gene, whereas LexA N-REST was unable to repress reporter gene expression in a Sin3 minus yeast strain (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, this lack of repressor activity of LexA N-REST in the Sin3 null strain could be rescued by co-expression of Sin3 (Fig. 5 A). To test whether mSin3A is involved in repression by REST in mammalian cells, a competition assay was performed using a peptide from REST containing the mSin3A interaction domain (Gal4F4). HEK293 cells were transfected with a RE1 type II sodium channel CAT reporter gene, pSDK7. This reporter construct is expressed at low levels due to its repression by the endogenous REST protein (Fig. 5 B). In the presence of the competitor peptide, the type II sodium channel reporter gene was derepressed, presumably due to binding of endogenous mSin3A to the competitor peptide. (Fig. 5 B). In the absence of competitor peptide, overexpression of mSin3A has no effect on activity of the reporter gene (data not shown). An in situ hybridization study was performed using antisense riboprobes specific for mouse mSin3A, REST, and CoREST. Sense riboprobes were used as controls in each situation and resulted in no obvious staining (data not shown). At embryonic day 8.5, both the REST and mSin3A genes were expressed widely throughout the embryo, including the somites, the presomitic mesoderm, and the head mesenchyme (Fig. 6). However, at this stage, CoREST exhibited a much more restricted pattern of expression, with strong expression in the head mesenchyme, but no visible staining in either the somites or the presomitic mesoderm (Fig.6). By day 11.5 of development, the disparity between the expression patterns of the two co-repressors was no longer apparent. Both mSin3A and CoREST appeared to be expressed fairly ubiquitously throughout the embryo (Fig. 6). The repressor protein REST/NRSF plays a crucial role in suppressing the neuronal phenotype outside of the developing nervous system. However, until recently, little was known about the mechanism by which REST repressed its target genes. A previous study determined that a newly identified co-repressor, CoREST, mediated repression from the COOH terminus of REST (1.Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E.

In this study, we investigated whether the known co-repressor mSin3A, a crucial component of many inducible repression systems, might also be involved in repression by REST. We found, using several approaches, that mSin3A interacts with the NH2-terminal repressor domain REST and that this interaction is required for function. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that REST is present in a complex with both mSin3A and CoREST in nuclei isolated from HEK293 cells. By exploiting the finding that removal of a consensus NLS in REST relocalized it to the cytoplasm, we were also able to visualize the interaction of REST with mSin3A and CoREST in intact mammalian cells, thus circumventing the potential problem of disruption of complexes during cell extraction procedures. The observation that REST, mSin3A, and CoREST are capable of associating in the cytoplasm indicated that interaction of the co-repressors with REST did not require REST to be bound to its target DNA sequence. REST and mSin3A were also found to interact in an in vitro“GST pull-down” assay. Furthermore, the combination of the GST pull-down and yeast two-hybrid experiments mapped the sites of interaction on the two proteins. Amino acids 32–122 of REST were sufficient for interaction with mSin3A. Importantly, this 90-amino acid region overlaps with the NH2-terminal domain of REST (amino acids 1–83) previously shown to be required for its repressor activity (7.Tapia-Ramirez J. Eggen B.J.L. Peral-Rubio M.J. Toledo-Aral J.J. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that binding of mSin3A is responsible for the repressor activity of this domain. The mSin3A-interacting domain of REST mapped to the region of mSin3A containing PAH-2 and flanking sequences. This was confirmed by the co-immunoprecipitation studies. At present, it is not clear whether the binding of REST to mSin3A is direct or whether it involves other bridging proteins that may be present in the reticulocyte lysate used for the in vitro translation of mSin3A products. The site on mSin3A through which REST interacts is involved in binding of another DNA-binding protein, Mad (13.Kasten M.M. Ayer D.E. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4215-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17.Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), and partially overlaps with the site of interaction of the co-repressors SMRT (18.Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5500-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19.Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M.

Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar) and the general transcription factor TFIIB (18.Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5500-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, alternatively spliced forms of mSin3B, containing only PAH-1 and PAH-2 and lacking the histone deacetylase interaction domain, have been identified (21.Alland L. Muhle R. Hou H. Potes J. Chin L. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these shorter forms of mSin3B may attenuate repressor function. Therefore, since REST also appears to bind to PAH-2, it is possible that repression by REST could also be modulated by interaction with shorter dominant negative forms of mSin3. This could provide a way of dynamically regulating the REST repressor complex. The NH2-terminal repressor domain of REST requires mSin3A for repression. This was most strikingly apparent in yeast, where the ability of the NH2 terminus of REST to repress was abolished in a Sin3-negative yeast strain. In mammalian cells, the ability of endogenous REST to repress reporter genes could be decreased by overexpression of the NH2-terminal repressor domain of REST, and this effect could be reversed by co-expression of mSin3A. Although significant, these effects were relatively small, probably due to the presence the COOH-terminal repression domain of REST. It has been shown that mSin3A/B interacts with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins to recruit multiprotein complexes containing histone deacetylases, resulting in the localized deacetylation of histones in the region around specific promoters (22.Kadosh D. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This is believed to cause nucleosomes to take on a highly condensed structure, preventing access of the transcriptional activation machinery and resulting in transcriptional repression (23.Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 24.Wolffe A.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 16-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, it is known that Sin3 proteins are able to mediate repression even in the absence of histone deacetylase activity, suggesting that mSin3A/B utilizes multiple mechanisms for repression (18.Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5500-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25.Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 682-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, mSin3A is able to bind the general transcription factor TFIIB, suggesting that mSin3A may also repress through direct inhibition of transcriptional initiation (18.Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5500-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, mSin3A-mediated repression through the NH2-terminal repression domain of REST could involve histone deacetylation as reported recently (26.Huang Y. Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 10: 867-872Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and/or direct inhibition of the transcriptional machinery. Unlike the case for the NCoR and SMRT co-repressors, CoREST did not appear to bind to mSin3A. It remains to be determined whether the two co-repressors utilized by REST converge on components of a common repressor complex or whether the two function by completely independent mechanisms. REST may utilize mSin3A and CoREST differentially during development.In situ hybridization data showed that at day 8.5 of mouse development mSin3A was expressed fairly ubiquitously, whereas CoREST expression was restricted only to the head region. After this time, by day 11.5, the expression patterns of mSin3A and CoREST were overlapping and extended to most tissues in the embryo. This result suggests either that REST can repress its target genes through recruitment of mSin3A in the absence of a COOH-terminal co-repressor or that other co-repressors can substitute for CoREST at this stage of development. REST repressor complexes may function differently depending on whether they utilize mSin3A alone or in combination with other co-repressors. Future studies to distinguish between these possibilities will provide insight into the processes by which the neuronal phenotype is established and maintained during development.

Low affinity interactions between zinc and specific zinc fingers in MTF-1 reversibly regulate its binding to the metal response elements in the mouse metallothionein-I promoter. This study examined the subcellular distribution and DNA binding activity of MTF-1 in cells treated with zinc or cadmium. Immunoblot analysis of cytosolic and nuclear extracts demonstrated that in untreated cells, about 83% of MTF-1 is found in the cytosolic extracts and is not activated to bind to DNA. In sharp contrast, within 30 min of zinc treatment (100 μm), MTF-1 is detected only in nuclear extracts and is activated to bind to DNA. The activation to bind to DNA and nuclear translocation of MTF-1 occurs in the absence of increased MTF-1 content in the cell. Furthermore, immunocytochemical localization and immunoblotting assays demonstrated that zinc induces the nuclear translocation of MTF-1-FLAG, expressed from the cytomegalovirus promoter in transiently transfected dko7 (MTF-1 double knockout) cells.

The rapid induction of MT-I and -II gene transcription by heavy metals (1.Andrews G.K. Prog. Food Nutr. Sci. 1990; 14: 193-258PubMed Google Scholar) is mediated by metal response elements (MREs), present in multiple copies in the proximal promoters of MT genes (7.Stuart G.W. Searle P.F. Palmiter R.D. Nature. 1985; 317: 828-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A protein that binds directly and specifically to MREs (8.Koizumi S. Suzuki K. Ogra Y. Yamada H. Otsuka F. Eur. J.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3763-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). MTF-1 is a six-zinc finger protein in the Cys2His2 family of transcription factors. Human, mouse, and pufferfish MTF-1 have been cloned (10.Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W.

Hoppe Seyler. 1999; 380: 175-185Google Scholar), and this protein has been highly conserved, particularly in the zinc finger domain. The C terminus of mammalian MTF-1 contains three transactivation domains, which are acidic, proline-rich, and serine/threonine-rich, respectively (13.Radtke F. Georgiev O. Müller H.-P. Brugnera E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of native and recombinant MTF-1 is reversibly modulated by zinc interactions with the finger domain (14.Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The zinc fingers are heterogeneous in function and at least two exhibit low affinity binding of zinc (15.Chen X.H. Agarwal A.

Treatment of cells with zinc in vivo results in a rapid, dramatic increase in the DNA binding activity of MTF-1 measuredin vitro (10.Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In contrast, the DNA binding activity of MTF-1 is apparently not activated by transition metals other than zinc (8.Koizumi S. Suzuki K. Ogra Y. Yamada H. Otsuka F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17.Koizumi S. Yamada H. Suzuki K. Otsuka F. Eur. J.

Homozygous deletion of the mouse MTF-1 gene revealed that MTF-1 is essential for zinc and cadmium induction, as well as for basal expression of the mouse MT-I and -II genes in embryonic stem cells (19.Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). MTF-1 is also essential for induction of these genes by oxidative stress (3.Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L.C. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and hypoxia (20.Murphy B.J. Andrews G.K. Bittel D. Discher D.J. McCue J. Green C.J. Yanovsky M. Giaccia A. Sutherland R.M. Laderoute K.R. Webster K.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1315-1322PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, several signal transduction pathways may impinge on the activities of MTF-1. Mice homozygous for targeted deletions of the MTF-1 gene die in utero due to failure of liver development, demonstrating that the MTF-1 gene is an essential gene (21.Günes Ç. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Müller K.H. Lichtlen P. Blüthmann H. Marino S. Aguzzi A. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2846-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), unlike the mouse MT-I and -II genes (22.Masters B.A. Kelly E.J. Quaife C.J. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Transition metal regulation of gene expression has been documented in species from every kingdom of organisms. In many instances, the transition metal itself directly interacts with a preexisting metalloregulatory protein, and this interaction leads to a change in conformation of the protein and an alteration in the DNA or RNA binding activity of the protein (23.O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1993; 261: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The available evidence suggests that MTF-1 is a metalloregulatory protein that serves as an intracellular zinc sensor to activate gene expression. This model predicts that MTF-1 would be located in the cytoplasm to facilitate direct interaction with free zinc. Since previous studies have not addressed the subcellular localization of MTF-1, it is not clear whether this cellular response to metal ions is initiated in the cytosol or nucleus. Furthermore, it is unclear how MTF-1 senses the toxic metal cadmium. Therefore, we examined the effects of zinc and cadmium treatment on the subcellular localization and DNA binding activity of mouse MTF-1. The following reagents were used in this study:in vitro TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI); Microcon 10 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA); nonfat dry milk, protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad); NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents and BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce); Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell); ECL Western blotting (immunoblotting) detection reagent, Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL); X-Omat film for autoradiography (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY); LipofectAMINE and LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.); four chamber glass slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL); rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Sp1 (PEP 2), USF1 (C-20) and FLAG-probe (D-8) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA); rat monoclonal antibody against Hsp90 and rabbit anti-rat IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada); and the DAB kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The polyclonal antiserum against purified bacterial recombinant mouse MTF-1 fused to glutathioneS-transferase was raised in rabbits (Covance Research Products, Inc., Denver, CO) and purified by protein A chromatography followed by passage through glutathioneS-transferase-agarose to remove glutathioneS-transferase antibodies (20.Murphy B.J.

Mouse Hepa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose (DMEM) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The mouse dko7 cell line is a simian virus 40 large T-antigen-immortalized fibroblast derived from embryonic stem cells lacking MTF-1 (MTF-1 double knockout) and was a generous gift of Dr. Walter Schaffner, University of Zurich (Zurich, Switzerland) (13.Radtke F. Georgiev O. Müller H.-P. Brugnera E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. For nuclear and cytosolic extract preparations, cells (2 × 106) were plated in 15-cm Petri dishes and grown to 80% confluency. For transfection followed by extract preparation, cells (1.2 × 105) were plated in six-well plates (9.4 cm2) and grown to 50% confluency. For transfection and subsequent immunocytochemistry, cells (2.5 × 104) were plated in four-chamber glass slides (1.8 cm2) and grown to 50% confluency. All FBS was heat-inactivated prior to use; all media were supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Whole cell extracts, nuclear extracts (NEs), and cytosolic extracts (CEs) were prepared essentially as described (14.Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 24.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Briefly, for preparation of nuclear extracts, treated cells were placed on ice, the medium was removed, and cells were washed once with cold PBS. Cells were scraped off the dish and collected by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and immediately centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 2 times the original packed cell volume of cell lysis buffer, allowed to swell on ice for 10 min, and homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (B pestle). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was saved for cytosolic extracts. The nuclei were resuspended, using six strokes of a Teflon-glass homogenizer, in 3 volumes (about 750 μl) of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25% glycerol). The nuclear suspension was stirred on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 89,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and concentrated in a Microcon 10 concentrator by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. For preparation of CE, the supernatant obtained after removal of nuclei was mixed thoroughly with 0.11 volume of 10× cytoplasmic extraction buffer (1× cytoplasmic extraction buffer: 30 mmHEPES (pH 7.9) at 4 °C, 140 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2) and then centrifuged at 89,000 × gfor 1 h. The supernatant was collected and concentrated in a Microcon 10 concentrator by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. In transfection experiments, NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents was used to prepare extracts. However, because of the presence of EDTA, the addition of exogenous zinc was required to activate MTF-1 DNA binding activity in these extracts. SDS lysis of cells was performed on plates using 1× SDS sample buffer without reducing agent or bromphenol blue. Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagent and bovine serum albumin as the standard. EMSA was performed as described previously (3.Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L.C. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Extracts (10–20 μg of protein in 2–5 μl) were incubated in a total volume of 20 μl for 15 min at 4 °C in binding reaction buffer containing 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 μg of dI-dC/μg of protein with 2–4 fmol of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide MRE-s or Sp1 binding sequence (5,000 cpm/fmol) for MTF-1 or Sp1, respectively. Protein-DNA complexes were separated electrophoretically at 4 °C in 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 80:1) at 15 V/cm. The gel was polymerized in running buffer consisting of 0.19 m glycine (pH 8.5), 25 mm Tris, and 0.5 mm EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried, and labeled complexes were detected by autoradiography. Cell extracts (50–100 μg of protein) were separated by 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) under reduced conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with primary antibody diluted in 3% nonfat dry milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase diluted in 3% nonfat dry milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min at room temperature, developed by chemiluminescence, and exposed to hyperfilm ECL. Relative band intensities were quantitated using Biomax 1D image analysis software (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems). Equal protein loading and transfer was verified visually by staining membranes with Ponceau solution. The CMV-MTF-1 expression vector was described previously (14.Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The MTF-1-FLAG construct was created by polymerase chain reaction amplification from this template using a sense primer that encompassed the translation start codon and an antisense primer against the carboxyl terminus that also incorporated the FLAG coding sequence. The amplified product was cloned into the CMV vector. Vectors were verified by DNA sequencing. dko7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown to ∼50% confluence. After washing the cells with serum-free DMEM, DNA and LipofectAMINE mixture prepared in serum-free DMEM was added. For immunocytochemistry, the mixture consisted of 2 μl/well LipofectAMINE, 4 ng/well CMV-MTF-1-FLAG expression vector, and 300 ng/well SV-β-gal, as an internal control for transfection efficiency, in 250 μl of DMEM. In experiments in which preparation of nuclear and cytosolic extracts was performed, cells were treated with 4 μl/well LipofectAMINE, 100 ng/well CMV-MTF-1 expression vector, and 1 μg/well SV-β-gal in 1.2 ml of DMEM. After 5 h, an equal volume of DMEM containing 2× FBS was added, and the incubation was continued overnight. The following morning, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM containing 1× FBS. Zinc treatment was initiated in the afternoon of day 2. After 1 h, cells were processed for either immunocytochemistry, as described below, or for nuclear and cytosolic protein isolation. Twenty-four hours after transfection, dko7 cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and then incubated for 6 h in DMEM containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Cells were then treated for 30 min with 100 μmZnSO4 in this medium, washed with PBS, and fixed with 70% ethanol for 5 min. Slides were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 10% goat serum in PBS-Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal FLAG antibody or Sp1 antibody diluted 1:500 or 1:100, respectively. Slides were then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase and stained with a DAB kit. Synthesis of recombinant mouse MTF-1 was performed using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system (TnT lysate), as described in detail previously (18.Bittel D. Dalton T. Samson S. Gedamu L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7127-7133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that the rabbit polyclonal antisera against bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-MTF-1 was specific for MTF-1 in supershift EMSA (20.Murphy B.J. Andrews G.K. Bittel D. Discher D.J. McCue J. Green C.J. Yanovsky M. Giaccia A. Sutherland R.M. Laderoute K.R. Webster K.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1315-1322PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of this MTF-1 polyclonal antisera was examined by immunoblotting (Fig.1). Recombinant mouse MTF-1 synthesizedin vitro in a TnT lysate system was used as a positive control (Fig. 1, lane 1), and an extract from dko7 (MTF-1 double knockout) cells was used as a negative control (Fig.1, lane 2). Mouse MTF-1 migrates with an apparent molecular mass of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 3), despite its predicted size of 72.5 kDa (10.Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This aberrant mobility may reflect the clustering of acidic, serine, and proline residues in the structure of MTF-1 (10.Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 13.Radtke F. Georgiev O. Müller H.-P. Brugnera E. Schaffner W.

Cell. 1983; 32: 1241-1255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 27.Chan J.Y. Han X.L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The MTF-1 band was absent in extracts from dko7 cells (Fig. 1, lane 2) but was detected in whole cell extracts from mouse Hepa cells (Fig. 1, lane 3) and from dko7 cells transiently transfected with an MTF-1 expression vector (see below). Two other bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼200 and ∼57 kDa were detected in cell extracts from both dko7 and Hepa cells (Fig. 1). The subcellular distribution of MTF-1 in untreated and zinc-treated cells was investigated by immunoblotting. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared from mouse Hepa cells, and it was noted that approximately 4-fold more protein was extracted in the cytosolic versus the nuclear extracts obtained from the same number of cells. On average, these extraction procedures recovered 88 pg of cytosolic protein and 21 pg of nuclear protein per cell. Immunoblotting of these extracts was performed using MTF-1 antiserum, and extracted proteins were normalized per cell for analysis. To account for differences in the amount of protein recovered in nuclear versus cytosolic extracts, 50 μg of nuclear and 200 μg of cytosolic protein were loaded (Fig.2 A, right panel). Quantitation of relative intensities of the MTF-1 bands in these samples suggested that 17 ± 9% of the immunoreactive MTF-1 was extracted in the nuclear fraction whereas 83 ± 9% of the MTF-1 was extracted in the cytosolic fraction from control cells. In the remaining figures, equal quantities of protein per lane were applied to the gels. Some variability between experiments in the amount of MTF-1 extracted from nuclei versus cytosol was noted, as is demonstrated by the S.D. value shown above. This variability was accentuated in the nuclear extracts relative to cytoplasmic extracts and may reflect subtle differences in cell density, cell passage number, or culture conditions. Each experiment contained an internal control of untreated cells cultured in parallel under identical conditions. In contrast to the results obtained using extracts from untreated Hepa cells, immunoblotting revealed that all MTF-1 immunoreactivity was present in nuclear extracts from cells treated with 100 μm ZnSO4 for 1 h. The cytosolic extract was devoid of detectable MTF-1 (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 A(left panel) is an immunoblot where equal amounts of nuclear and cytosolic proteins were applied to the gel. The amount of immunoreactive MTF-1 detected in nuclear extracts increased about 4-fold after zinc treatment of the cells. This is consistent with the data suggesting that about 83% of MTF-1 is initially found in the cytosolic fraction from untreated cells. Immunoblot analysis of proteins remaining in the nuclear pellet fraction after extraction revealed no MTF-1, Sp1, and USF1. Thus, MTF-1 is not preferentially extracted from nuclei of zinc-treated cells (data not shown). In contrast to MTF-1, two other transcription factors, known for their constitutive nuclear localization, Sp1 (Fig. 2 B) and USF1 (Fig. 2 C), were detected only in nuclear extracts, and the amount of immunoreactive protein was unaffected by zinc treatment. Thus, the cytosolic extracts were not significantly contaminated with nuclear transcription factors. Furthermore, immunoblotting with antisera against the predominantly cytosolic heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) (28.Ali A. Bharadwaj S. O'Carroll R. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 29.Kang K.I. Devin J. Cadepond F. Jibard N. Guiochon-Mantel A. Baulieu E.E. Catelli M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) revealed that the majority of Hsp90 was detected in cytosolic extracts (Fig. 2 D). Thus, nuclear extracts were not significantly contaminated with cytosolic proteins. EMSA was used to detect the MRE binding activity of MTF-1 (3.Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L.C. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 10.Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) in extracts from untreated and zinc-treated Hepa cells. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts from untreated cells contained little MTF-1 that was active to bind to DNA (Fig.3 A). Previous studies demonstrated that MTF-1 in whole cell extracts from control cells can be activated in vitro by the addition of zinc (5–30 μm) followed by incubation at 37 °C (14.Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). After zinc treatment, however, the DNA binding activity of MTF-1 increased 8–12-fold in nuclear extracts, while cytosolic extracts exhibited no detectable MTF-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 3 A). The identity of the MTF-1·MRE-s complex was confirmed by supershift EMSA using the MTF-1 antisera (data not shown). The rapid and dramatic increase in MTF-1 DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from cells treated with zinc correlates with the immunoblotting data and suggest that zinc induces the nuclear translocation and activation of MTF-1. Sp1 was detected only in nuclear extracts, and its DNA binding activity was unaffected by exogenous zinc (Fig. 3 B). A time course for zinc-dependent nuclear accumulation of MTF-1 protein and of MRE binding activity of MTF-1 was determined using Hepa cells treated with 100 μm ZnSO4 (Fig.4). The amount of immunoreactive MTF-1 in the nucleus increased about 2-fold by 5 min after the addition of zinc and 4-fold by 30 min (Fig. 4 A). As a control for potential differences in protein loading, MTF-1 was compared with immunoreactive USF1 in these same extracts (Fig. 4 A). Nuclear USF1 levels remained constant during zinc treatment. MRE binding activity of MTF-1 was monitored by EMSA (Fig. 4 B). A 2.5-fold increase in MRE binding activity was detected by 5 min after zinc treatment and a 7-fold increase was detected by 30 min, consistent with previous observations (18.Bittel D. Dalton T. Samson S. Gedamu L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7127-7133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Sp1 DNA binding activity remained constant (Fig.4 B). Immunoblotting of total cell SDS extracts was used to determine whether zinc causes a rapid change in the steady state levels of MTF-1 in Hepa cells. Hepa cells were treated with 100 μm ZnSO4 for 1 h, and the cells were lysed in situ in SDS sample buffer. Equal amounts of SDS-extracted proteins were then examined by immunoblotting. There was no detectable change in the amount of immunoreactive MTF-1 after this zinc treatment (Fig. 5). Likewise, there were no detectable changes in the relative amount of immunoreactive Sp1 or USF1. In addition, levels of immunoreactive MTF-1 in whole cell extracts from control and zinc-treated Hepa cells were unaffected by pretreatment of the cells with cycloheximide (10 nm to 100 μm) for 1 h (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that zinc does not cause a detectable increase in the steady state levels of MTF-1 protein within 1 h in these cells, nor is MTF-1 protein rapidly degraded.

For normal myotubes, hydrolysis remained low after the development of contractile activity. In contrast, after the development of contractile activity, dystrophic mdx myotubes had abnormally high levels of hydrolysis that were dependent on external calcium and that could be abolished by calpeptin, an inhibitor of calpain.

This association suggested a role for dystrophin in strengthening the muscle cell cortex against mechanical disruptions during contraction. Lack of functional dystrophin does lead to greater sarcolemmal fragility in both human Duchenne muscular dystrophy and its model, themdx mouse (13.Petrof B.J. Shrager J.B. Stedman H.H. Kelly A.M.

Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 121-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient plasma membrane disruptions are common in cells under mechanical stress (for review see Ref. 18.McNeil P.L. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Recent work shows that active cellular processes are required for repair of such disruptions (19.Steinhardt R.A. Bi G. Alderton J.M. Science. 1994; 263: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 20.Bi G.Q. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, although the plasma membrane repair system appears to function well in mdx mouse muscle, greater sarcolemmal fragility results in more frequent plasma membrane wounding during muscle contraction. These disruptions, however, are very transient, and the cells survive (14.Clarke M.S. Khakee R. McNeil P.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 121-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the possibility that these transient membrane disruptions eventually lead to the degeneration of muscle cells through long term elevation of calcium-dependent proteolysis resulting from increased calcium influx through abnormally active calcium leak channels. We used the accumulation of the fluorescent product of the artificial calpain substrate Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC (22.Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) to estimate the rate of proteolysis in individual resting myotubes. By using an antagonist of the calcium-specific leak channel, we established a link between the activity of this channel and the higher levels of proteolysis in dystrophic myotubes. Studies of differentiated myotubes in culture have several advantages over studies of whole or homogenized muscle. Because free calcium ion is a potent intracellular messenger that is tightly controlled in the cytoplasm of normal cells and because calcium homeostasis is disrupted by cell homogenization, real time studies of living cells are essential to yield new information on calcium-dependent processes. Observations of individual myotubes in culture allow fluorescence measurements that are not possible in whole muscle. Problems of uneven diffusion of regents into whole muscle are greatly reduced in the myotube system. Lastly, cultured myotubes escape the mechanical stresses that occur during whole muscle isolation. Mechanical stress can accelerate calcium-dependent proteolysis. Only after sustained contraction develops in cultured dystrophic myotubes does resting intracellular free calcium become abnormally elevated (1.Turner P.R. Shultz R. Ganguly B. Steinhardt R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 133: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9.Imbert N.C. Cognard G. Duport G. Guillou C. Raymond G.

Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) by chronic treatment with tetrodotoxin largely prevents the development of this elevated resting intracellular free calcium. Elevated resting intracellular free calcium in dystrophic myotubes has been linked to the persistent activation of a calcium-specific leak channel (7.Turner P.R. Fong P. Denetclaw W.F. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24.Fong P. Turner P.R. Denetclaw W.F. Steinhardt R.A.

There is evidence that the normal function of this voltage-insensitive channel is to facilitate recharging of depleted internal calcium stores (25.Hopf F.W. Reddy P. Hong J. Steinhardt R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22358-22367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After several days of sustained contractile activity in culture, the basal activity of this leak channel is several times higher for resting mdx myotubes than for resting normal myotubes (1.Turner P.R. Shultz R. Ganguly B. Steinhardt R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 133: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 2.Hopf F.W. Turner P.R. Denetclaw W.F. Reddy P. Steinhardt R.A. J. Am. Physiol.

Higher levels of free intracellular free calcium have been shown to be responsible for higher rates of leupeptin-sensitive proteolysis in intact soleus muscle (6.Turner P.R. Westwood T. Regen C.M. Steinhardt R.A. Nature. 1988; 335: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the role of the calcium leak channel in controlling the level of proteolysis in dystrophic and normal myotubes. Chronic treatment with methylprednisolone or its analogs is currently the only effective treatment for human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (26 -30). For myotubes cultured from a dystrophic mouse myoblast cell line, chronic treatment (for many days) with methylprednisolone results in a lowering of elevated resting intracellular free calcium to normal levels, and this effect is correlated with a reduction in45Ca2+ influx (31.Metzinger L. Passaquin A.C. Leijendekker W.J. Poindron P. Rüegg U.T. Brit. J. Pharm. 1995; 116: 2811-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We extended our studies on proteolysis to determine whether shorter treatment with increased levels of methylprednisolone inhibited the higher rate of proteolysis that developed in dystrophic myotubes. The intracellular proteolysis level in individual myotubes was estimated using a modified method of Rosser et al. (22.Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which measures the rate of formation of the fluorescent product of hydrolysis of an artificial calpain substrate, 7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin,t-Boc-l-leucyl-l-methionine amide (Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC)1(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, catalog number A-6520). The myotube culture medium was replaced just before the beginning of each experiment with rodent ringers, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.06 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mmd-glucose, 12.4 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.25 with 1 n NaOH (all ringers reagents from Fisher). CaCl2, 100 mm in deionized water (Calcium Electrode Standard, Orion, Boston, MA) was used to adjust the level of calcium ion in the rodent ringers to 0.09 mm or 1.8 mm. A 1000× stock of Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC was dissolved at 10 mm in anhydrous Me2SO (Sigma), aliquoted, and stored desiccated at −20 °C. Just before use, 3 μl of the Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC stock was thoroughly mixed with an equal volume of Pluronic F-127 (BASF, Mount Olive, NJ) 25% (w/w) in Me2SO. 1 ml of medium (out of 3 ml of total volume) was removed from the Petri dish containing the myotubes to be tested and mixed with the Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC/pluronic. Next, 3 μl of 2 mmtetrodotoxin was added to eliminate the direct effects of contraction on intracellular free calcium levels during the hydrolysis measurements. Finally, the Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC/pluronic/tetrodotoxin mixture was gently added back to the dish. The final concentration of Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC was 10 μm. The tetrodotoxin stock was 2 mm in 50 mm acetic acid. The Pluronic F-127 was added to help disperse the hydrophobic Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC in the aqueous ringers. After addition to the extracellular medium, the nonfluorescent, Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC passively diffuses across the plasma membrane where the thiol-reactive chloromethyl group may either be enzymatically conjugated to glutathione by intracellular glutathioneS-transferase or may react with protein thiols to produce a membrane-impermeant substrate that accumulates in the myotube. Proteolytic hydrolysis between the methionine and MAC-thiol groups unquenches the highly fluorescent MAC-thiol, which is retained within the cell (22.Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calpeptin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) stock solution was 280 μm in Me2SO, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. The antagonist of the calcium-specific leak channel, AN1043, stock solution was 10 mm in Me2SO, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. AN1043 was generously provided by Athena Neurosciences (South San Francisco, CA). The clasto-Lactacystin β-lactone (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) stock was 40 mm in Me2SO, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. Ammonium chloride powder (Mallinckrodt, Paris, KY) was mixed with Ringers just before use to give a final concentration of 20 mm. Prednisolone pro-drug, α-methylprednisolone-21-hemisuccinate, sodium salt (Sigma) was purchased as a lyophilized powder in phosphate buffer of pH less than 6. This pro-drug was made up at 10 mm in glass distilled water, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. When the pro-drug is added to rodent ringers of pH 7.25 at 37 °C, hydrolysis, stimulated by the more alkaline pH, results in the production of the active corticosteroid, methylprednisolone (32.Anderson B.D. Conradi R.A. Knuth K.E. Nail S.L. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 1985; 74: 375-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Light from a xenon lamp (Osram 75 watt, XBO 75 W/2, Berlin, Germany), filtered through a 380HT15 excitation filter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) and attenuated by neutral density filters to about 1% transmission, was used to excite the fluorescent product of hydrolysis. An Omega Optical 430DCLPO2 dichroic filter passed the emitted light around 460 nm (33.Zimmerman J.M. Ashe B. Yurewicz E.C. Patel G. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) to a photomultiplier (Thorn EMI Gencom, Fairfield, NJ) coupled to an IBM AT computer equipped with UMANS software (Chester Regen, Oakland, CA). A circular exit aperture (Leitz, Technical Instruments, San Francisco, CA) was set to be slightly smaller than the myotubes, which were chosen to be at least 18 μm in width. Nucleus-free areas in the middle of the myotubes were chosen for sampling. Measurements were made between 2 and 20 min after Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC addition, during which the rate of fluorogenic substrate hydrolysis was linear. Each myotube was sampled for 6 s. Before the addition of Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC, the background fluorescence was recorded for each myotube sampling site. To calculate the hydrolysis rate, the emission intensity minus the background was converted to counts/min and divided by the time after Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC addition at which the sample reading was taken. None of the protease inhibitors used were significantly fluorescent under the test conditions. In comparison of hydrolysis rates, p values were derived by using the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test. At the beginning and end of each experiment, emission intensity recordings were taken from a single benchmark fluorescent calibration bead (InSpeckTM Blue Microscope Image Intensity Calibration Kit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) centered in the exit aperture. Variation in these readings on any given day was less than 5%. If day to day variation in the emission intensity reading from the benchmark calibration bead was greater than 5%, the data were normalized to allow comparisons between different days. Satellite cell myoblasts were isolated from 8–9 week old normal mouse (C57BL) or mdx mouse hindlimb muscles according to the procedure described by Dimario and Strohman (34.Dimario J. Strohman R.C. Differentiation. 1988; 39: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Myoblasts were proliferated for 3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 20% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) + 2% chick embryo extract (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Life Technologies, Inc. number 15070-022) + 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) in collagen-coated 60-mm Petri dishes (Falcon 3004, Becton-Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ). To initiate differentiation, cultures were washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution without calcium and magnesium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and trypsinized (0.025% trypsin, 0.01% EDTA in normal saline). Cells were replated in differentiation medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 10% horse serum (Hyclone) + 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) on 35-mm-diameter Petri dishes. 2–3 h after the change to differentiation medium, 5 μm cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (Sigma) was added to the cultures to eliminate overgrowth by fibroblasts. The myoblasts were differentiated in 35-mm-diameter plastic Petri dishes (Corning 25000, Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) that had been modified by cementing a number one coverglass over a 20-mm-diameter hole machined in the center of the dish bottom. The coverglass insert created improved optics and allowed efficient transmission of UV light. Dow Corning silicone aquarium sealant was used to cement the coverglass in place. Before plating, the coverglass part of each dish was given three separate applications of 0.5 ml of 0.1% calf skin collagen in 0.1 n acetic acid (Sigma), diluted 1:9 with calcium and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). The collagen solution was air dried, and salt residue was removed by rinsing with Hanks' balanced salt solution after each collagen application. The dishes were UV irradiated for at least 1 h before use. Myoblast and myotube fusion was enhanced by the multiple collagen coats. “Day 12 myotubes,” for example, describes the number of days between the change to differentiation medium and the day of the experiment. Dishes of myotubes were carefully matched for each experiment so that the myotubes in paired dishes had been contracting the same number of days (and for at least 2 days before the day of the experiment, except for the differentiation series). Dishes were also matched for density, size, and quality of myotubes; tested myotubes were at least 18 μm in width, and dishes containing myotubes with large vacuoles (a sign of degeneration) were avoided. All medium changes and drug additions were slowly and carefully performed in a standard manner, because rough medium additions or removals were observed to greatly increase the rate of hydrolysis. Myotubes were at all times covered by a thin layer of medium retained in the well created by the coverglass insert. Excessive excitation light resulted in an artifactual increase in fluorescence, which was controlled by using attenuated excitation light for brief sampling periods (6 s). All experiments were performed on the stage of an inverted microscope with UV passing optics (model IM-35, Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) and a Nikon 40× UV glycerol-emersion lens (Technical Instruments, San Francisco, CA). Temperature was controlled at 36 °C by a Medical Systems Micro-Incubator (Greenvale, NY) mounted above the lens. Early in this study, it was noted that the rate of hydrolysis in individual myotubes varied with the stage of differentiation. Actively proliferating myoblast cells exited the mitotic cycle soon after transfer to medium containing lower levels of growth factors (differentiation medium). A few hours after transfer to differentiation medium, the mitotic inhibitor, cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside, was added to the cultures to eliminate fibroblast cells. The mononucleate myoblasts migrated over the collagen matrix to form linear arrays of mononucleate cells that later fused to form multinucleate myotubes. Myotubes also migrated and fused with other mono- or multi-nucleate muscle cells. Low plating density prolonged the period of myoblast-myotube fusion. After a variable period, migration and fusion ceased. Finally, contractile activity developed in these cultures, which also contained neuronal cells. In vitro differentiation was defined as complete in myotube cultures 2 days after the beginning of sustained contraction. Hydrolysis of a fluorogenic calpain substrate, Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC (22.Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23.Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), was high in both normal and mdx cells during the period of alignment and fusion. Fig.1 A shows the change in the hydrolysis rates for individual normal myotubes cultured between 9 and 24 days in differentiation medium (days 9–24). Low plating densities prolonged the period of myoblast and myotube fusion in these cultures derived from the hindlimb muscles of an 8-week-old normal mouse. Myotubes continued to align and fuse through day 10 for this primary culture. Proteolysis rates, as estimated by the accumulation of the fluorescent product of Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC hydrolysis, were high during myotube alignment and fusion. For mdx myotubes, hydrolysis rates during the alignment and fusion phase are not shown but followed the same pattern as for normal myotubes; high rates during alignment and fusion were followed by a decrease to relatively low rates of hydrolysis (Day 7, Fig. 1 B). The development of contractile activity was correlated with distinctly different fluorogenic substrate hydrolysis patterns for normal andmdx myotubes. For normal myotubes, the development of contractile activity was correlated with a decline in substrate hydrolysis, as shown in Fig. 1 A. In these myotubes, active contraction was first observed on day 12 and continued through day 24. In contrast, the development of contractile activity in mdxcultures was correlated with a pattern of increasing substrate hydrolysis. The longer a culture had been contracting, the higher the rate of substrate hydrolysis. Fig. 1 B shows a differentiation series for myotubes derived from an 8-week-oldmdx mouse. These cultures began contracting on day 6 and continued contracting through day 27. Because we were interested in studying the increase in proteolysis that appears after the development of contraction, we chose day 12 to day 18 cultures for all later proteolysis studies in mdx and normal myotubes (Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). These cultures had been contracting for at least 2 days before testing. At the beginning of all fluorogenic substrate hydrolysis measurements, 2 μm tetrodotoxin was added to eliminate the direct effects of contraction on basal proteolysis rates.Figure 2Low external calcium reduces the proteolysis rate in mdx myotubes. Emission intensity slope for the fluorescent product of Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC hydrolysisversus number of myotubes with a given slope in varied levels of external calcium ion. Normal and mdx myotubes were cultured in differentiation medium 12–18 days before measuring the rate of accumulation of the fluorescent product of Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC hydrolysis. Culture dishes matched for contractile activity, myotube size, and density were changed to either 1.8 or 0.09 mmcalcium rodent ringers 30 min before Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC addition. To eliminate contraction during the experiment, 2 μmtetrodotoxin (RBI/Sigma) was added with the Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC.mdx myotubes tested in 1.8 mm calcium rodent ringers (A) had an average hydrolysis rate about 2.5 times higher than the rate for normal myotubes in 1.8 mm calcium rodent ringers (C). When mdx myotubes were tested in 0.09 mm calcium rodent ringers, the hydrolysis rate was reduced significantly (B), p < 0.0001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For muscle fibers dissected from the flexor digitorum brevis of mdx mice, transfer to low external calcium decreases levels of intracellular free calcium ion measuredin situ using fura-2 directly microinjected into each skeletal muscle fiber (6.Turner P.R. Westwood T. Regen C.M. Steinhardt R.A. Nature. 1988; 335: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The rate of net protein degradation, measured using a tyrosine assay in intact soleus muscle frommdx mice is also sensitive to low external calcium levels (6.Turner P.R. Westwood T. Regen C.M. Steinhardt R.A. Nature. 1988; 335: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To test in situ the effect of low external calcium on the hydrolysis rate of the fluorogenic calpain substrate in individualmdx myotubes, we changed from differentiation medium to rodent ringers containing either 0.09 or 1.8 mm calcium 30 min before Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC addition (Fig. 2). mdx myotubes in 0.09 mm calcium had an overall significantly lower rate of substrate hydrolysis than mdx myotubes in 1.8 mm calcium (p < 0.001); the hydrolysis rate of mdx myotubes in low calcium was not significantly different from the rate for normal myotubes in 1.8 mmcalcium (p = 0.6423) (Figs. 4 and 7). Thus, for the dystrophic mdx myotubes, decreasing the calcium gradient across the sarcolemma reduced the abnormally high protease activity to nearly normal levels. This result suggests that the difference in proteolysis rates between normal and mdx myotubes is due to a calcium-activated protease. Because a short treatment (15–30 min) with low external calcium is sufficient, the decrease in fluorogenic substrate hydrolysis is probably due to decreasing calcium influx and not due to store depletion. In dystrophic mdx myotubes the increased calcium-activated proteolysis is related to abnormal activity of the calcium-specific leak channel (1.Turner P.R. Shultz R. Ganguly B. Steinhardt R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 133: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This channel is found in contractile normal and mdx myotubes but not in earlier developmental stages. After days of contractile activity, the calcium-specific leak channel is open more often in resting mdx myotubes than in resting normal myotubes (1.Turner P.R. Shultz R. Ganguly B. Steinhardt R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 133: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The calcium-specific leak channel is thought to facilitate the refilling of internal calcium stores following contraction (25.Hopf F.W. Reddy P. Hong J. Steinhardt R.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2036848107,"Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is associated with, in addition to impaired insulin release, elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFA) in the blood. Insulin release is stimulated when β-cells are acutely exposed to FFA, whereas chronic exposure may inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion. In the present study we investigated the direct effects of long chain acyl-CoA (LC-CoA), the active intracellular form of FFA, on insulin exocytosis. Palmitoyl-CoA stimulated both insulin release from streptolysin-O-permeabilized HIT cells and fusion of secretory granules to the plasma membrane of mouse pancreatic β-cells, as measured by cell capacitance. The LC-CoA effect was chain length-dependent, requiring chain lengths of at least 14 carbons. LC-CoA needed to be present to stimulate insulin release, and consequently there was no effect following its removal. The stimulatory effect was observed after inhibition of protein kinase activity and in the absence of ATP, even though both kinases and ATP, themselves, modulate exocytosis. The effect of LC-CoA was inhibited by cerulenin, which has been shown to block protein acylation. The data suggest that altered LC-CoA levels, resulting from FFA or glucose metabolism, may act directly on the exocytotic machinery to stimulate insulin release by a mechanism involving LC-CoA protein binding.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), possibly by providing additional acyl groups for LC-CoA formation or complex lipid synthesis. Evidence that a rise in cytosolic LC-CoA plays a role in intracellular signaling is indirect and based on the following findings. First, addition of FFA increases total LC-CoA (3.Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M.C. Regazzi R. Deeney J.T. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, although glucose acutely lowers total LC-CoA, because of a decreased mitochondrial content as FFA oxidation is inhibited (3.Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M.C. Regazzi R. Deeney J.T.

Diabetes. 1991; 40: 327-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it appears to increase the cytosolic pool because complex lipid synthesis, regulated by LC-CoA availability, is stimulated (3.Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M.C. Regazzi R. Deeney J.T. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, stimulation of islets with glucose for 30 min increases total LC-CoA (11.Liang Y. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 327-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial LC-CoA oxidation, which elevates cytosolic LC-CoA, enhances glucose-induced secretion (7.Vara E. Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Metabolism. 1986; 35: 266-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12.Chen S. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Fifth, inhibition of malonyl-CoA production from glucose, which presumably prevents the rise in cytosolic LC-CoA, blocks glucose-induced insulin secretion (12.Chen S. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Sixth, specific antisense mRNA inhibition of expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the enzyme that synthesizes malonyl-CoA, inhibits glucose-induced insulin secretion (13.Zhang S. Kim K.-H. Cell. Signaling. 1998; 10: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Exogenous FFA have been shown to readily traverse cellular membranes by non-carrier-mediated passive diffusion (flip-flop) (14.Hamilton J.A. Civelek V.N. Kamp F. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20852-20856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 16.Kamp F.

Upon entry into the cell FFA must undergo esterification to their intracellular LC-CoA esters to be further metabolized. The roles of cytosolic LC-CoA esters are many and include synthesis of lipids for structural integrity and energy storage as well as second messengers involved in intracellular signaling. In recent years there has been increased interest in the intracellular effects of LC-CoA esters themselves. In a cell free system, LC-CoA esters have been shown to stimulate budding of vesicles from the cis surface of the Golgi apparatus and fusion of vesicles to the medial surface of the Golgi apparatus (17.Glick B.S.

The effects of FFA on isolated islets and clonal pancreatic insulin secreting cells (HIT) are dependent on the exposure time. β-Cells stimulated acutely with FFA exhibit an enhanced secretory response to glucose (3.Prentki M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas chronic exposure results in impaired secretion (1.Deeney J.T. Tornheim K. Korchak H.M. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. J. Biol.

The mechanisms by which these effects are mediated have yet to be elucidated. Acute stimulation by non-cell-permeant LC-CoA on insulin secretion was demonstrated in streptolysin-O-permeabilized clonal insulin-secreting cells (HIT T-15). Acute stimulatory effects of LC-CoA on exocytosis, as measured by changes in β-cell membrane capacitance (28.Neher E. Marty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Clonal insulin-secreting cells (HIT-T15) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin, 10% fetal calf serum, 10−7m selenous acid, and 10 μg/ml glutathione (1.Deeney J.T. Tornheim K. Korchak H.M. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19840-19845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 48-well plates (Costar) and were used between passages 67 and 85. NMRI mouse islets were prepared by collagenase digestion and dispersed in Ca2+-free media (29.Ämmälä C. Eliasson L. Bokvist K. Larsson O. Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1993; 472: 665-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Single β-cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium prior to capacitance measurements. Cells were washed two times in an intracellular buffer containing 140 mmK+ glutamate, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, titrated with Ca2+ to a final free Ca2+ concentration of 100 nm, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.1. Streptolysin-O (Difco, Detroit, MI) was dissolved (4 ml/bottle) in intracellular buffer with 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were then incubated with streptolysin-O (3.2 units/ml, 150 μl/well) for 30 min at 0 °C in an ice water bath. Streptolysin was removed, and the cells were further incubated with intracellular buffer for 10 min at 37 °C and then cooled for 5 min in ice water before media were exchanged for the Ca2+/EGTA test solution. To measure insulin release from streptolysin-O-permeabilized cells in the absence of ATP, cells were permeabilized at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of 2 mm ATP. The cells were then cooled, and the permeabilizing solution was exchanged for the Ca2+/EGTA test solution described below, modified by the substitution of creatine for ATP and creatine phosphate. Permeabilized cells were incubated in Ca2+/EGTA buffers containing 140 mm K+ glutamate, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 2 mm creatine phosphate, 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 with CaCl2 titrated to the designated free [Ca2+]. To measure insulin release from permeabilized cells, in the absence of ATP, Ca2+/EGTA buffers were modified by the substitution of 2 mm creatine for ATP and creatine phosphate. The substitution of creatine for ATP and creatine phosphate was made to create a system that would generate ADP from residual ATP (30.Corkey B.E. Deeney J.T. Glennon M.C. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M.

Free [Ca2+] was determined using a Ca2+-sensitive electrode from Orion (Boston, MA.) and Ca2+/EGTA standards from World Precision Instruments (Sarasota, FL). Acyl-CoA compounds were dissolved in water and added to the Ca2+/EGTA buffers prior to incubation with cells. Free [Ca2+] did not change subsequent to the addition of acyl-CoA esters. Following a 15-min incubation period at 37 °C, media were removed and samples were analyzed for insulin using a radioimmunoassay kit purchased from Linco Research Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Exocytosis was measured as increases in cell capacitance (28.Neher E. Marty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6712-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 29.Ämmälä C. Eliasson L. Bokvist K. Larsson O. Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1993; 472: 665-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier and the Pulse software (v. 8.30; HEKA Elektronik, Lamprecht/Pfalz, Germany). The interval between two successive points was 0.2 s, and the measurements of cell capacitance were initiated <10 s after establishment of the whole cell configuration. The extracellular medium consisted of 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 5 mmd-glucose. The volume of the recording chamber was 0.4 ml, and the solution entering the bath (1.5–2 ml/min) was maintained at +33 °C. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass, coated with Sylgard near their tips, and fire-polished. When filled with pipette solutions, the electrodes had a resistance of 3–4 MW. The pipette solution consisted of 125 mm K+ glutamate, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 3 mm Mg-ATP, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.15 with KOH). The free Ca2+ concentration of the resulting buffer was 0.22 mm using the binding constants of Martell and Smith (31.Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. 1 and 2. Plenum Press, New York1974Google Scholar). Rp-cAMPS was from BIOLOG (Hamburg, Germany). Bisindolylmaleimide and calphostin C were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for unpaired data. Palmitoyl-CoA stimulated insulin release from streptolysin-O-permeabilized insulin-secreting cells (HIT), as shown in Fig. 1. Raising the free Ca2+concentration from 0.01 μm to 10 μmresulted in a 5-fold increase in insulin release from permeabilized HIT cells. To normalize and compare results from eight separate experiments, the data in Fig. 1 were expressed as percentages of release obtained in control cells at 0.01 μmCa2+. Palmitoyl-CoA (10 μm) increased exocytosis of insulin from permeabilized cells at each free [Ca2+] tested. At 1 and 10 μm free [Ca2+], LC-CoA increased exocytosis by 59 and 50%, respectively. The enhancement by LC-CoA was less, 28 and 39%, respectively, at 0.01 and 0.1 μm free [Ca2+]. The effect of LC-CoA in stimulating insulin release from permeabilized insulin-secreting cells was concentration-dependent with a significant increase obtained at 1 μm and a nearly maximum stimulation obtained at 10 μm palmitoyl-CoA (Fig.2 A). There was some variability in the concentration at which the stimulatory effect of LC-CoA on exocytosis was observed, which could be explained by the high affinity of LC-CoA esters for membranes, resulting in differences in free and bound LC-CoA (32.Boylan J.G. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, as a result of variations in cell number, different amounts of free LC-CoA are delivered to the cells because of partitioning into cell membranes. The effect of LC-CoA was also dependent on chain length, with carbon chains of 16 or more causing large increases of about 60% in insulin release from permeabilized cells (Fig. 2 B). Myristoyl-CoA (C14) had an intermediate effect of 30%, whereas shorter chain lengths such as hexanoyl-CoA (C6) were ineffective in stimulating insulin exocytosis from permeabilized insulin-secreting cells. Palmitoyl-carnitine could not substitute for the CoA ester in stimulating exocytosis (data not shown). To explore the possibility that stimulation of exocytosis by LC-CoA was mediated by a classical PKC isoform (cPKC), we examined the effect of LC-CoA in cells in which these isoforms had been inhibited using the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (33.Deeney J.T. Cunningham B.A. Chheda S. Bokvist K. Juntti-Berggren L. Lam K. Korchak H.M. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18154-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Staurosporine, once presumed to be a specific PKC inhibitor (34.Easom R.A. Hughes J.H. Landt M. Wolf B.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), is now used as a general kinase inhibitor because of its rather nonspecific inhibitory action on a number of protein kinases (35.Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 208SCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The presence of 200 nmstaurosporine did not reduce the ability of acyl-CoA to stimulate exocytosis (Fig. 3), suggesting that the effect of LC-CoA was not dependent on phosphorylation induced by cPKC or a number of other kinases. In an attempt to determine the temporal relationship between elevated free LC-CoA concentration and stimulation of exocytosis from permeabilized insulin-secreting cells, insulin release from cells incubated with LC-CoA was compared with insulin release from cells preincubated with palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 4). Enhanced insulin release was obtained only from cells in which LC-CoA had been present during the incubation period. Permeabilized cells, in which LC-CoA was removed following a 15-min preincubation, responded similarly to control cells that were not exposed to LC-CoA. This indicates that the free LC-CoA indeed has to be present to stimulate exocytosis of insulin. To further evaluate the site of action of LC-CoA on the exocytotic machinery, the effect of replacing ATP and phosphocreatine with creatine in the incubation medium was examined. This effectively replaces ATP and the ATP regenerating system with a buffer that converts any ATP formed to ADP (30.Corkey B.E. Deeney J.T. Glennon M.C. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4247-4253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the removal of ATP from the permeabilized cells decreased exocytosis in response to 100 nm free [Ca2+], this did not diminish the ability of LC-CoA to enhance insulin release as shown in Fig.5. These data suggest that the effect of LC-CoA occurs late in the exocytotic process, after ATP-dependent docking of secretory granules. To investigate this possibility further, we employed the patch-clamp technique. The effect of LC-CoA on the cell capacitance of mouse pancreatic β-cells was measured using the standard whole cell configuration to allow exchange of the pipette solution for the cell cytosol. Under these conditions, LC-CoA (1–10 μm) increased the β-cell whole cell capacitance, suggesting that LC-CoA increased fusion of secretory granules to the plasma membrane (Fig.6) (28.Neher E. Marty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6712-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 29.Ämmälä C. Eliasson L. Bokvist K. Larsson O. Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1993; 472: 665-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the capacitance changes revealed that the rapid initial phase of exocytosis was significantly increased by LC-CoA. The initial rate of exocytosis was increased from 29 ± 3 fF/s to 51 ± 9 fF/s with LC-CoA (p < 0.05; n = 4 for control andn = 5 for LC-CoA), whereas the subsequent slower rate increased from 7 ± 3 fF/s to 13 ± 4 fF/s (not significant;n = 4 for control and n = 5 for LC-CoA). It is proposed that distinct functional pools of secretory granules are responsible for the different kinetic phases of exocytosis observed by cell capacitance measurements (36.Eliasson L. Renström E. Ding W.G. Proks P. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1997; 503: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, the rapid kinetics have been proposed to be due to exocytosis of already docked granules, comprising a readily releasable pool (37.Heinemann C. Chow R.H. Neher E. Zucker R.S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2546-2557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), whereas the final slower kinetic rate has been proposed to reflect the mobilization of secretory granules from a reserve pool (38.Parsons T.D. Coorssen J.R. Horstmann H. Almers W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1085-1096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Based on this hypothesis, LC-CoA significantly enhanced release from the docked pool of secretory granules. To further characterize the effect of LC-CoA on the β-cell membrane capacitance we examined the effects of chain length, protein kinase inhibition, removal of ATP, and addition of cerulenin, an inhibitor of protein acylation (Fig. 7). Consistent with our previous results, all LC-CoA tested stimulated exocytosis as shown in Fig. 7 A. Inhibition of PKC using calphostin C (1.5 μm) (39.Ikemoto H. Tani E. Matsumoto T. Nakano A. Furuyama J. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 83: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), bisindolylmaleimide (4 μm) (40.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and staurosporine (100 nm) (35.Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 208SCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) had no effect on the stimulation of exocytosis by LC-CoA (Fig. 7 B). The inhibitor Rp-cAMPS (100 μm) (41.De Wit R.J. Hekstra D. Jastorff B. Stec W.J. Baraniac J. van Driel R. van Haastert P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) also had no effect, suggesting that cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) does not play a role in the LC-CoA effect (Fig. 7 B). In addition, removal of ATP from the pipette solution had no effect on membrane capacitance, consistent with the insulin release data from streptolysin-O-permeabilized HIT cells (Fig. 7 C). Finally, the addition of cerulenin (100 μg/ml), which inhibits acylation of proteins by covalently modifying reactive cysteine residues (42.Moche M. Schneider G. Edwards P. Dehesh K. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6031-6034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), blocked the ability of palmitoyl-CoA to stimulate exocytosis, suggesting the interaction of LC-CoA with a protein in the exocytotic machinery (Fig. 7 D). It is well established that hormone responsiveness is altered by chronic hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia. Although such metabolic alterations are often accompanied by changes in LC-CoA levels, the underlying mechanisms responsive for changes in signal transduction have not been established. LC-CoA esters and products formed from them are potent regulators of enzymes and channels. It has been hypothesized that elevations in LC-CoA, phosphatidic acid, and diacylglycerol resulting from glucose stimulation (43.Dunlop M.E. Larkins R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) directly modulate the activity of enzymes including PKC isoforms (44.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 45.Limatola C. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) or modify the acylation state of key proteins involved in regulation of ion channel activity and exocytosis (46.Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 47.Bouvier M. Moffett S. Loisel T.P. Mouillac B. Hebert T. Chidiac P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 48.Linder M.E. Middleton P. Hepler J.R. Taussig R., G. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3675-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In this study we provide evidence that LC-CoA can directly modulate exocytosis of insulin from the pancreatic β-cell as determined by radioimmunoassay of insulin released from permeabilized HIT cells and capacitance measurements of mouse pancreatic β-cells. The membrane capacitance measurements performed in mouse β-cells suggest that LC-CoA enhances fusion of secretory granules with the β-cell plasma membrane and that this effect is physiologically relevant and not limited to clonal pancreatic cells. The concentration and chain length dependence of LC-CoA-mediated stimulation of exocytosis appear to occur in a physiologically relevant range. Previous studies from our laboratory have estimated that the total cytosolic LC-CoA pool in HIT cells is about 90 μmand that 0.5 μm of this is free (1.Deeney J.T. Tornheim K. Korchak H.M. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19840-19845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effective concentrations (1–10 μm) that stimulated exocytosis in the present study were within this range. The chain length requirements for exocytosis were fairly nonspecific. However, the general requirement for longer chain length compounds may be physiologically important based on their higher degree of partitioning into lipid bilayers (32.Boylan J.G. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the high prevalence of these chain length FFA in cells (49.Corkey B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which LC-CoA esters stimulated insulin release seems to involve a direct effect on exocytosis independent of known modulators of this process. The possibility that the effect of LC-CoA was dependent on cPKC, PKA, or a number of other kinases, was eliminated based on the failure of inhibition by calphostin C, bisindolylmaleimide, staurosporine and Rp-cAMPS to diminish the stimulatory effect of LC-CoA. In addition, the removal of ATP, although decreasing overall insulin release from the permeabilized cells, failed to influence LC-CoA-stimulated insulin release, suggesting that the effect of LC-CoA is not mediated by protein kinase-induced phosphorylation. The persistent effect of LC-CoA in the absence of ATP suggests that the LC-CoA effect is at a late stage of exocytosis, after ATP-dependent vesicle docking. The removal of ATP from the permeabilized system would limit further docking of secretory granules to the plasma membrane, but already docked vesicles would be unaffected and still capable of fusing with the membrane resulting in insulin release (36.Eliasson L. Renström E. Ding W.G. Proks P. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1997; 503: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of LC-CoA on the initial rate of exocytosis, as measured by changes in cell capacitance, supports a role for LC-CoA in stimulating fusion of already docked secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. The stimulatory effect of LC-CoA on the slower subsequent phase of exocytosis, although not significant, may be due to increased turnover of docking sites at the plasma membrane. Thus, increased fusion of granules to the plasma membrane would lead to an increase in the number of available docking sites to which granules in the reserve pool can be bound. Many of the SNAP receptor (SNARE) proteins believed to play a role in exocytosis are acylated, including SNAP-25 (50.Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) (51.Couve A. Protopopov V. Gerst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5987-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and synaptotagmin (52.Chapman E.R. Blasi J. An S. Brose N. Johnston P.A. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the post-translational palmitoylation of SNAP-25 is responsible for anchoring of the protein to the plasma membrane (53.Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It is not known whether palmitoylation plays a functional role in the acute regulation of vesicle fusion by modulating the levels of SNARE proteins available at the membrane. Alternatively, binding of LC-CoA to a SNARE or associated protein at a LC-CoA-specific binding site, as has been shown for the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (21.Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P.-O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22.Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.-O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), may be important in stimulating exocytosis. Binding of LC-CoA to an exocytotic protein such as synaptotagmin may increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of exocytosis, resulting in more of the docked secretory vesicles fusing with the membrane, even at low [Ca2+]i. If the protein-bound form of LC-CoA is the active modulator stimulating exocytosis, then the binding of LC-CoA to its effector must be reversible, because preincubation followed by removal of LC-CoA did not enhance exocytosis. Interestingly, the agonist-induced palmitoylation of endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase has been shown to regulate its association with cellular membranes and to be reversible within minutes (54.Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The effect of LC-CoA on the ATP-sensitive K+channel of the β-cell has also been demonstrated to be readily reversible (21.Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P.-O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The ability of cerulenin to block both protein acylation and the stimulatory effect of LC-CoA on insulin exocytosis suggests that the effect is mediated through an association of LC-CoA with a protein. Our demonstration that LC-CoA stimulates exocytosis of vesicles from an already docked pool suggests that the SNARE proteins are prime targets for such a modification by LC-CoA. The reversibility of the LC-CoA effect suggests that the modulation of cellular LC-CoA levels may play a role in regulation of exocytosis in the β-cell. These findings are consistent with a role for LC-CoA as a prime signal molecule that acts with Ca2+ and ATP to stimulate exocytosis under a variety of conditions associated with increased levels of LC-CoA. The identification of the specific LC-CoA-binding protein responsible for acute stimulation of insulin release and whether this protein is acylated or noncovalently modified by LC-CoA have yet to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2004365070,"DNA-gyrase exhibits an unusual ATP-binding site that is formed as a result of gyrase B subunit dimerization, a structural transition that is also essential for DNA capture during the topoisomerization cycle. Previous structural studies onEscherichia coli DNA-gyrase B revealed that dimerization is the result of a polypeptidic exchange involving the N-terminal 14 amino acids. To provide experimental data that dimerization is critical for ATPase activity and enzyme turnover, we generated mutants with reduced dimerization by mutating the two most conserved residues of the GyrB N-terminal arm (Tyr-5 and Ile-10 residues). Our data demonstrate that the hydrophobic Ile-10 residue plays an important role in enzyme dimerization and the nucleotide-protein contact mediated by Tyr-5 side chain residue helps the dimerization process. Analysis of ATPase activities of mutant proteins provides evidence that dimerization enhances the ATP-hydrolysis turnover. The structure of the Y5S mutant of the N-terminal 43-kDa fragment of E. coli DNA GyrB subunit indicates that Tyr-5 residue provides a scaffold for the ATP-hydrolysis center. We describe a channel formed at the dimer interface that provides a structural mechanism to allow reactive water molecules to access the γ-phosphate group of the bound ATP molecule. Together, these results demonstrate that dimerization strongly contributes to the folding and stability of the catalytic site for ATP hydrolysis. A role for the essential Mg2+ ion for the orientation of the phosphate groups of the bound nucleotide inside the reactive pocket was also uncovered by superposition of the 5′-adenylyl β-γ-imidodiphosphate (ADPNP) wild-type structure to the salt-free ADPNP structure.

It is also involved in catenation and decatenation, knotting and unknotting reactions of circle DNA molecules. All these processes require the binding and the hydrolysis of ATP (1.Gellert M.

Cell. 1980; 20: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). DNA-gyrase is involved in DNA replication, repair, recombination, and transcription (3.Menzel R. Gellert M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 201-225PubMed Google Scholar).Escherichia coli DNA-gyrase is composed of two subunits, GyrA and GyrB of 97 and 90 kDa, respectively. They associate to form an A2B2-active holoenzyme (4.Maxwell A. Gellert M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 69-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5.Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The GyrB subunit possesses two domains, a 43-kDa N-terminal domain (aa1 2–393) that contains the ATPase catalytic site and a 47-kDa C-terminal domain (aa 394–804) that is required for the interaction with GyrA. Kinetic studies of the ATPase activity of the GyrB subunit have provided a model in which the binding of ATP induces dimerization of the 43-kDa ATP-binding domain and activation of the catalytic center of hydrolysis (6.Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Dimerization is a reversible process coupled to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP bound at the dimer interface. X-ray crystallographic studies have provided the structure of the dimer of 43-kDa GyrB fragments complexed with ADPNP. The amino acids directly implicated in the nucleotide-binding site are mainly located in the N-terminal crystallographic subdomain (aa 2–220). The Tyr-5 residue, from the N-terminal extension (aa 2–16) of the second subunit that forms the dimer, partakes in a hydrogen bond to 2′-hydroxyl ribose of the bound ATP (7.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar).Based on biochemical and structural data of eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes, a catalytic clamp model for the ATP-dependent mechanism of DNA transfer into the enzyme has been proposed for type II DNA topoisomerases (8.Roca J. Berger J.M. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4057-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C.

Oudet P. Hancock R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5936-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this model, the binding of ATP promotes dimerization and thus closure of the GyrB N-terminal side of A2B2 tetramer. This structural transition allows entry and capture of a double-stranded DNA molecule (T-DNA). The GyrA subunit catalyzes the reversible formation of a covalent linkage between its Tyr-122 residue and 5′P of another DNA duplex wrapped around the holoenzyme (∼120 base pairs), called G-DNA. This results in the formation of a transient DNA gate through which the T-DNA passes. Following transport, DNA strand breaks are resealed, and the T-DNA molecule is released from the holoenzyme.The mechanism by which ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release are coupled to the various steps in the transport of one DNA double helix through another is of key importance in understanding reactions catalyzed by type II DNA topoisomerases. Pairing between the two N-terminal GyrB domains in the presence of ADPNP or ATP was assumed to be responsible for the conversion of an open clamp into a closed clamp protein conformation that captures a DNA molecule and is able to transfer it across the holoenzyme structure. The protein clamp opens for the next reaction when bound ATP is hydrolyzed, but if ATP is replaced by ADPNP, only a single round of DNA strand passage would occur and the enzyme would be trapped in a frozen conformation (10.Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11.Schultz P. Olland S. Oudet P. Hancock R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1978; 75: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, ATP hydrolysis is considered to be required only for enzyme recycling before a next catalytic round.A key untested prediction of the current models for gyrase function is that dimerization is critical for ATPase activity. To provide experimental evidence, we generated mutants with reduced dimerization by mutating the two most conserved residues of the GyrB N-terminal arm, Tyr-5 and Ile-10. Our data demonstrate that Ile-10 plays an important role in enzyme dimerization, and the nucleotide-protein contact mediated by Tyr-5 side chain residue is essential for helping the dimerization process. Analysis of ATPase activity show that dimerization enhances the turnover for hydrolyzing bound ATP. Our crystallographic study describes the mechanism of dimerization and the ATPase function of this enzyme.DISCUSSIONElectron microscopy studies on purified topoisomerase II enzymes have shown that the human and yeast N-terminal domains, homolog to the GyrB 43-kDa domain, are flexible and can move freely in the absence of nucleotide (11.Schultz P. Olland S. Oudet P. Hancock R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5936-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32.Benedetti P. Silvestri A. Fiorani P. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12132-12137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Upon ADPNP binding, they adopt a closed dimeric conformation similar to that observed in the conformation of E. coli GyrB 43-kDa complexed to ADPNP (7.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). This dimer allows the capture of a DNA duplex that is translocated during topoisomerization reaction (9.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is also associated to the enzyme turnover via activation of the hydrolysis of the bound ATP.Previous biochemical and structural studies have defined a functional model for GyrB ATPase activity (6.Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 7.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Upon the initial binding of one ATP molecule to a free subunit, the primary GyrB monomer-ATP complex dimerizes and becomes highly efficient for hydrolyzing ATP (6.Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step of the ATPase reaction is the dimerization step. However, a key untested prediction of this model is that dimerization is critical for ATPase activity. To provide experimental evidence, we searched for dimerization-deficient mutant proteins in order to study their ATPase activity.The crystal structure of GyrB 43-kDa domain bound to ADPNP displays a frozen conformation of the nucleotide-binding site in its stable dimeric form. Analysis of conserved residues lining the nucleotide-binding site reveals a peculiar role for the Tyr-5 side chain that binds to the 2′-hydroxyl group of the ADPNP ribose in the adjacent subunit, suggesting that this conserved residue plays a critical role in GyrB dimerization and function (7.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We recently showed that phenylalanine and serine substitutions of Tyr-5 severely affect all ATP-dependent reactions catalyzed by DNA-gyrase on DNA,e.g. supercoiling and decatenation of circular DNA molecules (13.Brino L. Mousli M. Oudet P. Weiss E. Plasmid. 1997; 38: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 33.Brino L. Bronner C. Oudet P. Mousli M. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DNA binding did not stimulate the ATPase activity of these mutants. We therefore proposed that Tyr-5 is a crucial residue for GyrB dimerization and thus for DNA transfer during catalytic transfer of DNA duplex catalyzed by gyrase.In the present study, we show that Y5F or Y5S point mutations affect dimer interactions (Fig. 1 A). However, the formation of mutant-WT heterodimers indicates that Tyr-5 plays a role but is not essential at the dimer interface. This is further confirmed by the crystal structure of the Y5S mutant complexed with ADPNP. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the overall three-dimensional structure of the mutant monomer is similar to that previously described for the WT protein (7.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Only minor conformational differences were observed for residues 2–9. At the site normally occupied by the Tyr-5 phenolic group in the WT structure, an extra density interpreted as a bound glycerol was found. In normal physiological conditions, three water molecules that would fill the cavity while maintaining the stabilizing H bond network could easily replace this new cofactor. This finding is in agreement with our observation that the turnover of the ATPase activity of the Y5S and Y5F GyrB mutants is reduced but not inhibited (Fig. 2), (33.Brino L. Bronner C. Oudet P. Mousli M. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).To determine the relative importance of dimerization in the activation of ATP hydrolysis, we looked for mutants unable to dimerize. Upon analysis of the three-dimensional structure, we identified two residues (Ile-10 and Val-12) of the N-terminal arm that form numerous hydrophobic contacts with the adjacent subunit and could be crucial for dimerization (Figs. 3 B and 4). We then chose Ile-10 as the mutagenesis target because, in contrast to Val-12, it does not interact with the flexible loop 99–117 that participates to the nucleotide-binding site. Instead, Ile-10 side chain anchors the invading N-terminal arm through the formation of a strong hydrophobic cluster at the dimer interface (Fig. 3 B). As shown in Figs.1 and 2, Gly mutation of the Ile-10 residue severely affected the ability of the ATPase domain to dimerize without altering the affinity for ATP. Interestingly, the ATPase turnover was severely decreased (10-fold at 10 μm enzyme concentration) but not completely inhibited, and the cooperativity of the ATPase reaction was lost. These results provide evidence that the 43-kDa domain monomer is still able to hydrolyze ATP, but the dimerization process observed with the wild type is essential for the cooperativity of the ATPase reaction.To understand the structural requirement of GyrB dimerization for ATPase activity, we analyzed the nature of intra- and intermonomeric contacts (Fig. 4). The bound nucleotide recruits several amino acids of loops 99–117 and 326–338. Within the dimer structure, these loops form an extensive network of intermolecular van der Waals contacts and direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds. The additional interactions brought by dimerization stabilize the potentially flexible loops of the binding pocket (residues 80–90, 99–117, and 326–338), which are contacted by the N-terminal arm and adjacent helices (aa 2–28) of the dimeric partner. These dimeric contacts most probably affect the P-loop signature motif 114GXXGXG located at the C terminus of the loop 99–117 (31.Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), facilitating the orientation of the γ-phosphate in the catalytic site. More interestingly, additional dimer contacts mediated by Arg-22, Met-25, Tyr-26, and Gly-28 help to position residues 26–28 and loop 326–338 which form the walls of a little channel leading to the γ-phosphate group where solvent molecules including the reactive water molecule (S1) transit to reach the catalytic site of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 5). Therefore, dimerization of GyrB subunits provides a unique structural mechanism to allow water molecules to activate efficiently the hydrolysis of bound ATP molecules. Upon the nucleophilic attack mediated by Glu-42 and S1 on the γ-phosphate group of the ATP molecule (Fig. 6), this little channel formed at the dimer interface may also provide an exit for the Pi liberated during ATP hydrolysis. These observations highlight a new aspect of the structure-function relationship in topoisomerase II ATPase. They provide a better understanding of the mode of action of drugs targeting the N-terminal dimer interface, for example antibiotics belonging to coumarin and cyclothialidin families. DNA-gyrase (EC 5.99.1.3) is a bacterial type II topoisomerase that negatively supercoils plasmid DNA molecules in vitro. It is also involved in catenation and decatenation, knotting and unknotting reactions of circle DNA molecules. All these processes require the binding and the hydrolysis of ATP (1.Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3872-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 2.Kreuser K.N. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1980; 20: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). DNA-gyrase is involved in DNA replication, repair, recombination, and transcription (3.Menzel R. Gellert M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 201-225PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DNA-gyrase is composed of two subunits, GyrA and GyrB of 97 and 90 kDa, respectively. They associate to form an A2B2-active holoenzyme (4.Maxwell A. Gellert M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 69-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5.Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The GyrB subunit possesses two domains, a 43-kDa N-terminal domain (aa1 2–393) that contains the ATPase catalytic site and a 47-kDa C-terminal domain (aa 394–804) that is required for the interaction with GyrA. Kinetic studies of the ATPase activity of the GyrB subunit have provided a model in which the binding of ATP induces dimerization of the 43-kDa ATP-binding domain and activation of the catalytic center of hydrolysis (6.Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Dimerization is a reversible process coupled to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP bound at the dimer interface. X-ray crystallographic studies have provided the structure of the dimer of 43-kDa GyrB fragments complexed with ADPNP. The amino acids directly implicated in the nucleotide-binding site are mainly located in the N-terminal crystallographic subdomain (aa 2–220). The Tyr-5 residue, from the N-terminal extension (aa 2–16) of the second subunit that forms the dimer, partakes in a hydrogen bond to 2′-hydroxyl ribose of the bound ATP (7.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Based on biochemical and structural data of eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes, a catalytic clamp model for the ATP-dependent mechanism of DNA transfer into the enzyme has been proposed for type II DNA topoisomerases (8.Roca J. Berger J.M. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4057-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 10.Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11.Schultz P. Olland S. Oudet P. Hancock R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5936-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this model, the binding of ATP promotes dimerization and thus closure of the GyrB N-terminal side of A2B2 tetramer. This structural transition allows entry and capture of a double-stranded DNA molecule (T-DNA). The GyrA subunit catalyzes the reversible formation of a covalent linkage between its Tyr-122 residue and 5′P of another DNA duplex wrapped around the holoenzyme (∼120 base pairs), called G-DNA. This results in the formation of a transient DNA gate through which the T-DNA passes. Following transport, DNA strand breaks are resealed, and the T-DNA molecule is released from the holoenzyme. The mechanism by which ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release are coupled to the various steps in the transport of one DNA double helix through another is of key importance in understanding reactions catalyzed by type II DNA topoisomerases. Pairing between the two N-terminal GyrB domains in the presence of ADPNP or ATP was assumed to be responsible for the conversion of an open clamp into a closed clamp protein conformation that captures a DNA molecule and is able to transfer it across the holoenzyme structure. The protein clamp opens for the next reaction when bound ATP is hydrolyzed, but if ATP is replaced by ADPNP, only a single round of DNA strand passage would occur and the enzyme would be trapped in a frozen conformation (10.Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11.Schultz P. Olland S. Oudet P. Hancock R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1978; 75: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, ATP hydrolysis is considered to be required only for enzyme recycling before a next catalytic round. A key untested prediction of the current models for gyrase function is that dimerization is critical for ATPase activity. To provide experimental evidence, we generated mutants with reduced dimerization by mutating the two most conserved residues of the GyrB N-terminal arm, Tyr-5 and Ile-10. Our data demonstrate that Ile-10 plays an important role in enzyme dimerization, and the nucleotide-protein contact mediated by Tyr-5 side chain residue is essential for helping the dimerization process. Analysis of ATPase activity show that dimerization enhances the turnover for hydrolyzing bound ATP.

Upon the nucleophilic attack mediated by Glu-42 and S1 on the γ-phosphate group of the ATP molecule (Fig. 6), this little channel formed at the dimer interface may also provide an exit for the Pi liberated during ATP hydrolysis. These observations highlight a new aspect of the structure-function relationship in topoisomerase II ATPase. They provide a better understanding of the mode of action of drugs targeting the N-terminal dimer interface, for example antibiotics belonging to coumarin and cyclothialidin families.

https://openalex.org/W1969309856,"Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB by extracellular signals involves its release from the inhibitor protein IκBα in the cytoplasm and subsequent nuclear translocation. NF-κB can also be activated by the anticancer agent camptothecin (CPT), which inhibits DNA topoisomerase (Topo) I activity and causes DNA double-strand breaks during DNA replication to induce S phase-dependent cytotoxicity. Here we show that CPT activates NF-κB by a mechanism that is dependent on initial nuclear DNA damage followed by cytoplasmic signaling events. NF-κB activation by CPT is dramatically diminished in cytoplasts and in CEM/C2 cells expressing a mutant Topo I protein that fails to bind CPT. This response is intensified in S phase cell populations and is prevented by the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin. In addition, CPT activation of NF-κB involves degradation of cytoplasmic IκBα by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in a manner that depends on the IκB kinase complex. Finally, inhibition of NF-κB activation augments CPT-induced apoptosis. These findings elucidate the progression of signaling events that initiates in the nucleus with CPT-Topo I interaction and continues in the cytoplasm resulting in degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB to attenuate the apoptotic response.

In mammalian cells, NF-κB exists as dimeric complexes composed of p50, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, RelB, or p52. These proteins share a conserved Rel homology domain that encodes dimerization, DNA binding, and nuclear localization functions. NF-κB associates with members of the IκB family of proteins, most notably IκBα, which masks the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB and retains it in the cytoplasm (4.Beg A.A. Ruben S.M.

Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Dissociation from IκBα is essential for NF-κB to enter the nucleus and to activate gene expression. Several signaling cascades that control NF-κB activation converge at an IκB kinase (IKK)1 complex, responsible for site-specific phosphorylation of IκBα at serines 32 and 36 (6.Chen Z.J. Parent L.

Phosphorylation of IκBα induces multiubiquitination of IκBα and its subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent 26 S proteasome (11.Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Orian A. Ciechanover A.

This sequence of events can be induced without de novo protein synthesis by multiple extracellular stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1, phorbol ester (PMA), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and others. However, NF-κB activation can also be achieved through mechanisms that are distinct from the above IKK-dependent model. These include phosphorylation-independent yet proteasome-mediated IκBα degradation induced by ultraviolet irradiation (13.Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 14.Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P.

Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.M. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on the stimuli, NF-κB can be activated through multiple distinct regulatory pathways. Activation pathways of NF-κB typically originate from ligand-receptor interactions on the cell membrane. However, NF-κB can also be activated by a group of agents that damage DNA in the nucleus. A paradox confounding our current understanding of the mechanism of NF-κB activation by agents that damage DNA is that the major source of damaged DNA is in the nucleus, whereas latent NF-κB complex is in the cytoplasm. It was previously hypothesized that a signal may transfer from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (18.Stein B. Kramer M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ponta H. Herrlich P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4540-4544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this model, a recent study by Piette and Piret (19.Piret B. Piette J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4242-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) provides evidence that NF-κB activation by DNA-damaging agents correlates with their capacity to induce DNA breaks. However, the requirement of damaged DNA in the nucleus has not been directly demonstrated. In contrast, Devaryet al. (20.Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) showed that enucleated cells (i.e.cytoplasts) retained full capacity to activate NF-κB following UV irradiation, indicating that nuclear DNA damage is not necessary for NF-κB activation by UV irradiation. There is now substantial evidence to support the notion that UV activation of NF-κB involves activation of cell surface receptors by ligand-independent oligomerization (14.Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar,21.Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M. Peppelenbosch M.P. Bos J.L. Kruijer W.

Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Whether nuclear DNA damage can directly activate an intracellular NF-κB signaling pathway without involving cell surface receptors remains an important question yet to be resolved. We and others have observed that an anti-cancer agent, camptothecin (CPT), can activate NF-κB in pre-B or T cell lines (19.Piret B. Piette J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4242-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26.Miyamoto S. Wuerzberger S.M. Seufzer B. Boothman D.A. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 624Google Scholar). CPT inhibits the activity of DNA topoisomerase (Topo) I (27.Hsiang Y.H. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1722-1726PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Giovanella B.C. Stehlin J.S. Wall M.E. Wani M.C.

Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar). Topo I changes the supercoiling of DNA and therefore plays critical roles in DNA replication, in RNA transcription, and, indirectly, in DNA damage repair (30.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). CPT selectively binds to and stabilizes a covalent Topo I-DNA reaction intermediate, referred to as the cleavable complex, which contains a single-strand DNA break (SSB) (31.Hsiang Y.H. Hertzberg R. Hecht S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14873-14878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Covey J.M. Jaxel C. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5016-5022PubMed Google Scholar). DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are then generated during DNA replication when the replication fork collides with the cleavable complex (33.Hsiang Y.-H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, our objective was to determine whether or not nuclear events associated with the DNA-damaging action of CPT and a clinically utilized derivative of CPT, topotecan (TPT) (34.Slichenmyer W.J. Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 271-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 35.Rothenberg M.L. Ann. Oncol. 1997; 8: 837-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) were required for activation of cytoplasmically localized NF-κB complexes. We also examined whether CPT activation of NF-κB modulated an apoptotic response. Our findings elucidate a series of nuclear events induced by CPT/TPT that converge with cytoplasmic signaling events responsible for the activation of NF-κB, which can provide anti-apoptotic function. Culture conditions for 70Z/3 and 70Z/3-CD14 murine pre-B cells have been described (36.Miyamoto S. Seufzer B. Shumway S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CEMp and CEM/C2 human T cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Pommier (National Institutes of Health) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro, Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratory, Inc.), 1000 units of penicillin G (Sigma), and 0.5 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Sigma) in an humidified 5% CO2-95% air incubator (Forma Scientific). HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells and PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics as above in a 10% CO2-90% air incubator. The human kidney embryonic fibroblast 293 (HEK293) was maintained in the latter medium on 0.1% (w/v) gelatin-coated plastic culture dishes. CPT, VP16, calpain inhibitor I (ALLN), Me2SO, bacterial LPS, PMA, cycloheximide, aphidicolin, and cytochalasin B were purchased from Sigma. TPT was a gift from SmithKline Beecham. Lactacystin was generously provided by Dr. E. J. Corey (Harvard University). Stock solutions were prepared in Me2SO at 10 mm (CPT), 10 mm (VP16), 30 mm (aphidicolin), cytochalsin B (10 mg/ml), and 25 mm (lactacystin, 25% Me2SO-75% H2O). TPT stock was made in water at 30 mm. LPS was prepared in RPMI growth medium at 1 or 10 mg/ml. Human recombinant TNFα was from CalBiochem and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma). A 50 μm PMA stock was made in 100% ethanol. A cycloheximide stock solution was made in water at 50 mg/ml. In each experiment, all samples received the same amounts of Me2SO to control for potential Me2SO effects. All stock solutions were stored in aliquots at either −70 °C or −20 °C. IgGs against IκBα (C21), c-Rel (C), p65 (A and C20), Rel-B (C-19), p52 (I-18), and p50 (NLS) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Kodak, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies and protein A were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Prestained protein molecular weight markers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cell preparation and Western immunoblots were performed as described (36.Miyamoto S. Seufzer B. Shumway S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and developed using the ECL procedure according to the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were then exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). The Igκ-κB oligonucleotide probe and conditions for EMSA were previously described (36.Miyamoto S. Seufzer B. Shumway S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For supershift assays, 1 μg of IgG antibodies specific to members of the NF-κB proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to nuclear extracts for 20 min on ice prior to addition of radiolabeled probe. The AP-1 site used for control EMSA reactions was obtained from Promega. Enucleation was performed as described (37.Poste G. Exp. Cell Res. 1972; 73: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. PC3 or HeLa cells were seeded in 30-mm dishes, grown overnight, and exposed to cytochalasin B (10 μg/ml) for a total of 30 min at 37 °C. Plates were placed upside down in 400-ml centrifuge bottles and bathed in growth medium containing cytochalasin B at the same concentration. Plates were secured at the bottom of the centrifuge bottles by appropriately sized styrofoam. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 37 °C using a Beckman JA-14 rotor. The rotor and centrifuge chamber were prewarmed to ∼37 °C by prior centrifugation without samples. Plates with enucleated cells (i.e. cytoplasts) were then removed from the centrifuge bottle, gently rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with prewarmed growth medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples of enucleated cells were fixed in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid, stained with Hoechst dye 33258, and photographed under a fluorescent microscope equipped with a 4′6,-diamidino-2-phenylindole-specific filter. The enucleation efficiency varied from ∼75 to 95% for PC-3 and HeLa cells. Cells (HEK293, HeLa, or PC-3) were transiently transfected using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (38.Cao Z.D. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). CEMp and CEM/C2 cells were transfected with DEAE-Dextran method (39.Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). An NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter (3xκB-Luc) was constructed by inserting aHindIII-BglII fragment of 3xκB-CAT into theHindIII-BglII sites of the tk-Luc plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. R. Evans, Salk Institutite). 3xMκB-Luc was constructed using a similar cloning strategy starting with the 3xMκB-CAT (40.VanAntwerp D.J. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6037-6045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h following transfection, cells were treated with TPT (30 μm) or CPT (10 μm) for 2 h, rinsed twice with growth medium, and further incubated without drugs for 6 h before termination of the cultures. Positive control samples were treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for a total of 8 h. Control samples were transfected with the LacZ cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pCMX vector (CMV-LacZ). For CEMp and CEM/C2 cells, total proteins were used for normalization. Full-length human IKKα cDNA was provided by Dr. I. M. Verma (Salk Institute). Full-length human IKKβ cDNA was cloned by screening a human kidney cDNA library in λZAPII with a polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragment using a HeLa cDNA library (CLONTECH) and TO237 (5-CTCAGCAGCTCAAGGCCAAG-3′) and TO240 (5′-CCAGAGCTCCTTCTGCCGC-3′) primers. IKKα and IKKβ with a Lys-to-Ala substitution at the conserved ATP binding site were generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant genes were placed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector (CLONTECH). HEK293 cells were transfected with these constructs by calcium phosphate precipitation and then treated with either TNFα (10 ng/ml) or TPT (30 μm) for 2 h. Nuclear extracts were analyzed by EMSA as described above. Cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Kodak) to determine expression levels of respective dominant-negative mutants in each condition. An horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for secondary antibody followed by ECL development. Production and infection of HA-tagged wild-type and HA-tagged S32A/S36A mutant IκBα expression constructs were described (36.Miyamoto S. Seufzer B. Shumway S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other IκBα deletion mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. Stable pools were selected with hygromycin (1 mg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the expression levels of the corresponding proteins were examined by either anti-IκBα (C21, a C-terminal epitope) or anti-HA antibodies. For experiments shown in Figs. 7 B and 9, HA-S32A/S36A clone 5 that expressed a relatively high level of the mutant protein was used. Similar but less pronounced effects were also seen with pooled cultures and in five isolated clones expressing varying levels of mutant protein (not shown).Figure 9Inhibition of CPT activation of NF-κB results in an increased apoptotic response. 70Z/3-CD14 cell clones expressing either WT or S32A/S36A IκBα were exposed to 1 μm CPT for 24 h. These cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by FACS for relative DNA content. Each panel shows the relative levels of cells in each of the cell cycle phases as well as in sub-G1/G0 apoptotic peaks. Average levels of apoptosis ± S.D. from three independent experiments are shown below the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) N-terminally fused GFP-IκBα was generated by subcloning polymerase chain reaction amplified human IκBα (MAD3) into HindIII-BamHI sites of the pEGFP vector (CLONTECH), such that the entire MAD3 coding sequence was in-frame with the GFP coding sequence. Stable HEK293 cell clones were generated by G418 selection and subsequent FACS sorting. Cells were photographed using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped for fluorescence with the aid of a fluorescein-specific filter. For FACS sorting of G1, S, and total cell fractions for EMSA analyses, 70Z/3 cells untreated or treated with CPT, TPT, or LPS for appropriate durations were stained with Hoechst 33342 (stock at 10 mg/ml in water) at the final concentration of 10 μg/ml for 15 min at 37 °C in RPMI growth medium, followed by cell isolation using FACStarPLUS(Becton Dickinson) at 4 °C. 106 cells each were purified, and total cell extracts were prepared for EMSA analyses. The status of the cell cycle of purified fractions was confirmed by propidium iodide staining followed by analysis with FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Detailed protocols for apoptosis analyses using FACS have been published (41.Wuerzberger S.M. Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Byers K.L. Bornmann W.G. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1876-1885PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in ethanol, treated with a citric acid buffer to release fragmented DNA out of the cells, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed using FACSCalibur. NF-κB activity is dictated by its ability to bind cognate κB sites present in responsive genes. We utilized a κB site from the immunoglobulin κ intronic enhancer in EMSA analyses to evaluate NF-κB activation by CPT or TPT treatments. CPT induces dose-dependent (Fig.1 A, saturating at 10 μm) and transient (Fig. 1 B, peaking at 1–2 h) NF-κB binding activity in 70Z/3-CD14 pre-B cells. Addition of 50-fold excess specific and nonspecific oligonucleotides (Fig. 1 C,lanes 1–3) shows that the binding activity is specific to NF-κB. Specificity is further demonstrated by the interaction of binding complex with antibodies to p50, RelA, and c-Rel (Fig.1 C). Antibodies to other NF-κB family members, p52 and RelB, did not alter binding, indicating that these proteins are not components of the NF-κB complex induced by CPT in 70Z/3-CD14 cells. Pretreatment with cycloheximide (Fig. 1 D, lanes 3and 4) did not interfere with this pathway, which shows that CPT action does not require de novo protein synthesis. This activation is not limited to lymphoid cells because it was also induced by both CPT and TPT in CEM T leukemic, PC-3 prostate cancer, HEK293 embryonic kidney fibroblast, and HeLa cervical cancer cell lines (see below, others not shown). Induction of NF-κB DNA binding activity by CPT or TPT treatment resulted in increased NF-κB-dependent transcription of a luciferase reporter gene (see below). Thus, CPT or TPT activation of NF-κB occurs withoutde novo protein synthesis and may utilize pre-existing regulatory component(s). The primary molecular target of CPT or TPT is nuclear Topo I enzyme (27.Hsiang Y.H. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1722-1726PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Covey J.M. Jaxel C. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5016-5022PubMed Google Scholar). However, mitochondria also contain CPT-sensitive Topo I (42.Lin J.H. Castora F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is also possible that CPT activation of NF-κB may involve molecular target(s) other than nuclear Topo I. To evaluate the requirement of a nuclear event in NF-κB activation by CPT, we enucleated PC-3 and HeLa cells by the cytochalasin B-mediated enucleation procedure (37.Poste G. Exp. Cell Res. 1972; 73: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This protocol produced enucleated cells with approximately 90% efficiency as determined by nuclear staining with Hoechst dye (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with a previous report (43.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar), EMSA of total cell extracts prepared from intact and enucleated cells demonstrated that NF-κB activation by activators, such as PMA (Fig. 2 B) or TNF (80.Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), does not require an intact nucleus. By contrast, the NF-κB response by CPT and TPT was dramatically diminished in the enucleated cells (Fig. 2 B). Modest activation by TPT in enucleated cells is likely due to low numbers of intact cells present in the enucleated cell population (Fig. 2 B). NF-κB (p65), and upstream kinases in the signaling pathway, IKKα and IKKβ, are still present in the cytoplasts (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2,4, and 6), demonstrating that the lack of NF-κB activation response in certain enucleated samples (lane 4) is not due to potential leakage of these signaling components. Thus, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that a nuclear event is necessary for NF-κB activation by CPT-related compounds. Although the above data are consistent with the notion that an intact nucleus is required for NF-κB activation by CPT, it is unknown whether Topo I-induced DNA damage is also required for this process. Its DNA-damaging function requires CPT to interact with Topo I-DNA cleavable complexes (33.Hsiang Y.-H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether direct interaction of CPT and a Topo I-DNA complex is necessary for activation of NF-κB, we examined human CEM/C2 cells, which exclusively express a mutant Topo I enzyme (44.Fujimori A. Hoki Y. Popescu N.C. Pommier Y. Oncol. Res. 1996; 8: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant Topo I enzyme contains two amino acid substitutions, Met370 to Thr and Asp722 to Ser. The latter mutation alone makes Topo I enzyme ∼1000-fold more resistant to CPT (or TPT)-mediated inhibition of the religation of DNA nicks, making it incapable of efficiently inducing DNA damage by CPT treatment in vivo (45.Fujimori A. Harker W.G. Kohlhagen G. Hoki Y. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1339-1346PubMed Google Scholar). We compared CPT-induced NF-κB activity in CEM/C2 and the parental CEMp cells by EMSA. Time course and dose response studies (Fig. 3,A and B, respectively), as well as κB-dependent luciferase reporter assay (Fig.3 C), clearly demonstrated that CEM/C2 cells could not mount the NF-κB response by CPT treatment, whereas the parental cell line retained the ability to activate NF-κB. Efficient activation of NF-κB in CEM/C2 cells by TNF (Fig. 3 B) or other DNA-damaging agents, such as VP16 and ionizing radiation (Fig.3 D, others not shown), revealed that the lack of NF-κB activation was specific to CPT treatment. Thus, these results together provide strong evidence that Topo I-mediated nuclear DNA damage is necessary for NF-κB activation by CPT treatment. CPT inhibition of the religation step during the Topo I reaction induces stabilization of the cleavable complexes, resulting in generation of SSB. These SSB are reversible but can be converted into lethal DSB during S phase, when the replication fork collides with the cleavable complex (33.Hsiang Y.-H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that aphidicolin-induced inhibition of DNA polymerase activity prevents DSB liberation (34.Slichenmyer W.J. Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 271-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Aphidicolin prevents S phase-specific toxicity of CPT (46.D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate whether a SSB or DSB is critical for NF-κB activation by CPT, we examined the influence of aphidicolin on CPT induction of NF-κB. FACS analysis confirmed that ∼50% 70Z/3-CD14 cells were in S phase of the cell cycle at the time of CPT treatment (see below). The EMSA demonstrated that CPT activation of NF-κB was efficiently blocked by this treatment (Fig. 4 A,lanes 3–5). Aphidicolin, however, did not block NF-κB activation by bacterial LPS (lanes 10–12). Aphidicolin also did not directly block NF-κB DNA binding activity (lanes 6–8). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the generation of DSB, not SSB, is necessary for efficient NF-κB activation by CPT treatment (19.Piret B. Piette J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4242-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These data also imply that this activation pathway may occur only in the S phase of the cell cycle. We therefore enriched 70Z/3-CD14 cells in the S phase by FACS sorting after cells were stimulated with CPT or LPS for 2 h (Fig.4 B). Compared with a similarly obtained G1 cell population, NF-κB activation was 2.8-fold higher in the S phase population when equivalent amounts of cell extracts were analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 4 C). LPS stimulation did not show any significant differences between S and G1 cells. These findings demonstrate that CPT activation of NF-κB is cell cycle coupled and predominantly takes place during the S phase of the cell cycle in a DNA-polymerase-dependent fashion. This also can explain why NF-κB activation by CPT or TPT is relatively lower in virtually all cell types examined"

During carcinogenesis, the increased motility and invasiveness of tumor cells reflect the loss of characteristic epithelial features, including cell adhesion. While β-catenin, a component of AJ, plays a well characterized dual role in cell adhesion and signal transduction leading to epithelial cell transformation, little is known about possible roles of tight junction components in signaling processes. Here we show that mutants of the TJ protein zonula occludens protein-1 (ZO-1), which encode the PDZ domains (ZO-1 PDZ) but no longer localize at the plasma membrane, induce a dramatic epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of Madin-Darby canine kidney I (MDCKI) cells. The observed EMT of these MDCK-PDZ cells is characterized by a repression of epithelial marker genes, a restricted differentiation potential and a significantly induced tumorigenicity. Intriguingly, the β-catenin signaling pathway is activated in the cells expressing the ZO-1 PDZ protein. Ectopic expression of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene, known to down-regulate activated β-catenin signaling, reverts the transformed fibroblastoid phenotype of MDCK-PDZ cells.

In epithelial monolayers, individual cells are joined to each other by specialized structures including gap junctions, desmosomes, adherens junctions (AJ)1 and tight junctions (TJ). In addition to mediating cell-cell adhesion, TJ regulate the paracellular diffusion across epithelial monolayers and the maintenance of the asymmetric distribution of proteins and lipids to the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains of epithelial cells (1.Stevenson B.R. Keon B.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 89-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 2.Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev.

Physiol. 1998; 60: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The tight junction protein zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) is part of a multi-protein complex and binds directly to the integral TJ proteins occludin and to members of the claudin family (4.Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), thereby linking the TJ to the cytoskeleton via a direct or indirect interaction with actin (5.Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). ZO-1 belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family and contains three PDZ domains (6.Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a guanylate kinase (GUK) homology domain, and a proline rich C-terminal region (see Fig. 1). Since occludin lacks PDZ-binding motifs, binding between occludin and ZO-1 probably does not involve the PDZ domains. The function of the GUK domain, which lacks kinase activity in the MAGUK proteins analyzed so far, is not known but has been suggested to be important for binding of ZO-1 to occludin (5.Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). ZO-2 and ZO-3, two additional members of the MAGUK protein family present in TJ, show extensive homology to each other and to ZO-1. ZO-3 interacts with ZO-1 and the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of occludin, but does not bind ZO-2 (7.Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). ZO-2 binds directly to ZO-1 and occludin. Actin cosedimentation studies showed that ZO-2, ZO-3, and occludin all interact directly with F-actinin vitro and colocalize with actin aggregates at cell boarders in cytocholasin D-treated MDCK cells. The suggested model at the moment is that two independent complexes comprising ZO-1-ZO-2 and ZO-1-ZO-3 exist (rather than a three-member complex, ZO-1-ZO-2-ZO-3), and that these complexes link the tight junction to the actin cytoskeleton (8.Wittchen E., S. Haskins J. Stevenson B., R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35179-35185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Several other proteins have been described to interact with ZO-1, but the domains involved in binding or the physiological relevance of the interactions are, in most cases, unknown. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process well characterized in human colon cancer. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are thought to initiate the process, leading to aberrant crypt foci that develop into areas of benign epithelial hyperplasia or dysplasia and adenomas. Progression of these areas to carcinomas in situand malignant tumors depends on further changes in the transformed cells such as mutations in p21 Ras and p53 and the gradual loss of a number of characteristic features of differentiated epithelial cells. This process, also known as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), includes the disruption of apical-basolateral polarity, the disassembly of AJ and TJ, and the ability of the cells to degrade the basement membrane, to migrate, and to form metastases at distant sites. A reduced intercellular adhesion is a requisite for the higher motility and invasiveness of tumor cells and the expression or integrity of several components of AJ (i.e. α-catenin, β-catenin, γ-catenin/plakoglobin, E-cadherin) is altered or lost in different types of carcinoma (9.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar). β-Catenin plays a dual role as a structural component of AJ (10.Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) and as a signaling molecule in the Wnt signaling pathway (11.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt glycoproteins, the Ser/Thr-specific glycogen synthase kinase 3β phosphorylates β-catenin, APC, and axin/conductin (12.Behrens J. Jerchow B., A. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 13.Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are present as a multi-protein complex in the cytosol. Phosphorylated β-catenin is rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosomal pathway (14.Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Binding of Wnt glycoproteins to the Frizzled family of receptors results in the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β and thereby to an enhanced stability of β-catenin. Stabilized β-catenin can translocate into the nucleus where, in association with members of the Tcf/Lef transcription factor family, it regulates gene expression (15.Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 16.Aoki M. Hecht A. Kruse U. Kemler R. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), probably by recruiting the basal transcription machinery to promoter regions of Wnt target genes such as cyclin D1 (17.Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar, 18.Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar). Oncogenic transformation of mammalian cells is closely linked to the signaling function of β-catenin (19.Smits R. Kielman M.F. Breukel C. Zurcher C. Neufeld K. Jagmohan-Changur S. Hofland N. van Dijk J. White R. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Khan P., M. Fodde R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1309-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Intestinal cells carrying mutations in APC that activate the β-catenin/Tcf/Lef signaling pathway develop into adenomas and adenocarcinomas (20.Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). In addition, human colorectal neoplasms expressing a wild-type APC often show mutations in β-catenin that activate its signaling capacity (9.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice expressing a dominant allele of the β-catenin gene develop adenomatous intestinal polyps and nascent microadenomas, providing further evidence that activated β-catenin signaling contributes to cancer development (21.Harada N. Tamai Y. Ishikawa T. Sauer B. Takaku K. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5931-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). A few observations suggested that TJ components, in addition to their structural role, may also be involved in signaling events. ZO-1 is related to the Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor (Dlg-A), a component of septate junctions inDrosophila implicated in signaling during mitosis. Dlg proteins with mutations in the PDZ and SH3 domains cause neoplastic overgrowth of larval imaginal disc epithelial cells (22.Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). TheDrosophila orthologue of ZO-1, tamou, has been implicated in regulating the expression of extramacrochaetae (23.Takahisa M. Togashi S. Suzuki T. Kobayashi M. Murayama A. Kondo K. Miyake T. Ueda R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the fly orthologue of the inhibitor of differentiation protein. ZO-1 itself has been found in the nucleus of migrating epithelial cells at the edge of wounded monolayers or in epithelial cells induced to migrate by HGF (24.Gottardi C. Arpin M. Fanning S. Louvard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10779-10784Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To explore possible additional functions of ZO-1 besides its role as a structural component of TJ, we expressed progressive C-terminal deletion mutants of the protein in epithelial MDCKI cells. Surprisingly, mutants encoding only the N terminus including the PDZ domains no longer localized at the plasma membrane and induced a dramatic loss of the epithelial phenotype of MDCKI cells. This EMT included changes in the differentiation potential and tumorigenicity of the cells, together with a repression of epithelial (e.g.E-cadherin) and an induction of mesenchymal (e.g.fibronectin) marker genes. Interestingly, β-catenin/Tcf/Lef signaling was activated in MCDK-PDZ cells, indicating an involvement of β-catenin/Tcf/Lef signaling in the induction of the observed EMT. Thus, our results show that the cytosolic localization of the PDZ domains of ZO-1 leads to the transformation of MDCKI cells, most likely through a direct or indirect modulation of the β-catenin/Tcf/Lef signaling pathway. Human ZO-1 cDNA (GenBank™accession no. L14837) was kindly provided by J. Anderson. The following deletion mutants (see Fig. 1) were created by the PCR technique usingPwo polymerase (Roche): ZO-1-PDZ (amino acids 1–568), ZO-1-PS (amino acids 1–759), ZO-1-PSG (amino acids 1–798), and wild-type ZO-1. A FLAG epitope tag (5′-gattacaaagacgatgacgataaa-3′) was introduced into each 3′ oligonucleotide to generate a ZO-1 fusion protein with the FLAG tag at the C terminus. The different PCR products were cloned into the pCRblunt vector (Invitrogen), cut out withEcoRV, and cloned into the eukaryotic retroviral expression vector pLNCX (CLONTECH), cut with HpaI. Full-length human APC cDNA (GenBank™ accession no.M74088) was kindly provided by B. Vogelstein, and a myc tag (5′-gaacaaaaactcatctcagaagaggatctgaat-3′) was introduced at the 3′ end by PCR. The neomycin resistance gene in the retroviral pLNCX vector was replaced by a hygromycin-thymidine kinase fusion cDNA (kindly provided by C. Karreman) to yield the pLHygTkCX vector, into which the myc-tagged APC cDNA was cloned. The plasmid coding for the GST-E-cadherin cytoplasmic fusion protein was kindly provided by A. Ullrich and described elsewhere in detail (25.Müller T. Choidas A. Reichmann E. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10173-10183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). MDCKI cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. MDCKI cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 on 10-cm plates (Nunc) the day before transfection using the calcium phosphate technique as described (26.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Briefly, 16 μg of plasmid DNA (Nucleobond purified) were mixed with 40 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2 to a final volume of 400 μl. An equal volume of 2× BBS (50 mmBES (Sigma), 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 6.5) was added, and after 10 min at room temperature the mixture was added to the cells. The cells were incubated overnight at 3%CO2, washed twice with PBS, and incubated at 5% CO2. For stable transfections, 750 μg/ml G418 or 350 μg/ml hygromycin, respectively (Life Technologies, Inc.), were added 24 h after transfection. Single cell clones were established using either limited dilution or cloning rings. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured 3 days after 5 × 104 cells/cm2 had been plated on Transwell filters (Costar). TER was determined by applying an AC square wave current of 620 mA at 12.5 Hz across a cell monolayer plated on a 6.5-mm diameter Transwell™ filter. The voltage deflection was measured with a pair of Ag/AgCl voltage sensors (EVOM, World Precision Instruments). TER values were calculated by subtracting the blank values from the filter and the medium, and were normalized to the area of the monolayer (filter). 5 × 104cells/cm2 were grown on coverslips to confluence, washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 3% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde for 25 min at room temperature. The cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 10 min at room temperature. Unspecific binding was blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and primary antibodies (M2 monoclonal α-FLAG antibody; Eastman Kodak Co.) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Sigma; diluted 1:100 in 10% goat serum) were added for 2 h at room temperature. After washing the cells several times with PBS, bound primary antibodies were detected with fluorochrome-coupled isotype-specific secondary antibodies (Alexa). Coverslips were mounted (16.7% Mowiol, 33% glycerol in 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) and viewed with a conventional fluorescence microscope (Leica). Cells were trypsinized, and 2 × 104 cells were added to 800 μg of collagen type I (Promocell) in 10× DMEM to yield a final volume of 2 ml in 1× DMEM, 10% FCS and plated in 24-well plates (Costar). The plates were incubated 10 min at room temperature and 45 min at 37 °C before 1 ml of DMEM including 10% FCS was added. Where indicated, HGF (40 ng/ml, kindly provided by W. Birchmeier) was added to the medium and incubation was continued until a ductlike morphology became visible. Cells were fixed with 3% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and stained with 0.2% Carmin-Hemalaun in H2O overnight. Cells were resuspended at a cell density of 2 × 106 cells in 50 μl of DMEM and injected subcutaneously into the flank region of Swiss nude mice (IGR Villejuif, Paris, France) using five animals per cell line. Tumor formation was monitored by measuring the width (W) and length (L) of the tumors with W <L. The tumor volume was calculated according to the formula (W 2 × L × π/6). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 in six-well plates (Costar) the day before transfection. Transfection was performed using the calcium-phosphate technique as described above with 4 μg of luciferase reporter constructs containing either multimerized wild-type (TOP-FLASH) or mutant (FOP-FLASH) Tcf/Lef binding sites (kindly provided by H. Clevers). As a control for transfection efficiency, 1 μg of β-galactosidase construct under the control of the simian virus 40 promoter was included in each transfection. Cells were washed 24 h after transfection, and extracts were prepared in 400 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol using the luciferase assay kit from Promega. The relative luciferase units corresponding to the enzymatic luciferase activities obtained for the TOP or FOP reporter gene transcription, respectively, were normalized to the relative β-galactosidase activity. To allow easier comparison of the transcriptional activities, the background transcriptional activity represented by the FOP values was subtracted from the TOP values. Each transfection was done in triplicate, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities of each sample were measured in triplicate. The assay was performed in three independent experiments. To analyze the expression of proteins or to determine the free pool of β-catenin, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped from the plate in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 20 mm EDTA, 300 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 0.2% Triton X-100, and freshly added protease inhibitors (25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Sigma). The lysates were spun at 15,000 rpm in a table-top centrifuge and the supernatant (Triton X-100-soluble fraction) was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The pellet (Triton X-100-insoluble fraction) was re-extracted in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was spun at 15,000 rpm, and the supernatant was also snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford. To analyze the distribution of the different ZO-1 proteins to membrane and cytosol fractions, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped into homogenization buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). After incubating for 10 min on ice, the cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer and insoluble material was pelleted in a low speed centrifugation (5 min, 500 × g). The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C to obtain a membrane pellet and a cytosol fraction. The membrane pellet was extracted with homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C, and insoluble material was pelleted for 30 min at 4 °C and 100,000 × g. The cytosol and the Triton X-100-soluble membrane fraction were analyzed by Western blot to detect the different ZO-1 proteins. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (BDH Laboratories) using a semidry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). Unspecific antibody binding was blocked with 10% nonfat milk powder in PBS. The membrane was probed with primary antibodies (anti-Flag M2 (Kodak), anti- α, β -catenin, anti-plakoglobin (Transduction Laboratories), anti-E-cadherin (kindly provided by Axel Ullrich), anti-ZO-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or anti-pan cytokeratins (Sigma)) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed several times with PBS, 0.5% Tween20 (Sigma), and immunoreactive bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce) using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson). Equal amounts of cell lysates were precleared with glutathione-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C and incubated with 5 μg of purified GST-E-cadherin cytoplasmic fusion protein or a 3-fold molar excess of GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting complexes were washed three times with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm ammonium molybdate, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate; bound complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and β-catenin was visualized by immunodetection. Total RNA was prepared as described previously (27.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 4 m guanidine thiocyanate (Fulka), 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1% β- mercaptoethanol (Sigma). After the solution had been passed several times through a sterile needle, an equal volume of water-saturated phenol:chloroform (1:1) was added and vortexed for at least 10 s. After centrifugation, the total cellular RNA of the aqueous phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. The RNA was recovered by centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in sterile water, and the RNA was separated on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel to visualize the integrity of the RNA. For semiquantitative analysis, 0.5 μg of total RNA was used for RT-PCR using the TITAN One-Tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reverse transcriptase reaction was performed for 45 min at 50 °C or 40 °C. PCR cycles used to amplify the cDNA were as follows: denaturing step: 45 s 94 °C, annealing step: 45 s at 40–50 °C, and elongation step: 68 °C, 1 min per 1000 bp to be amplified; 25 cycles were used. RT-PCR products were analyzed on 0.5–2% agarose gels. The following primer pairs were used: gapdh, 5′-gggctccttctgctgat-3′ and 5′-gggctgggtggcagtgat-3′; ZO-1, 5′-ggttcttcgagaagctgga-3′ and 5′-ggtttgtctggcctctgccc-3′; E-cadherin, 5′-ccgaattctcccgatgaaattggaaat-3′ and 5′-cgcggatccctagtcgtcctcgccgcc-3′; occludin, 5′-ggggaattcacttcaggcagcctcg-3′ and 5′-gggaagcttttctatgttttctgtcta-3′; fibronectin, 5′-ggtatgaagtgagtgtctatgctct-3′ and 5′-ggttctgccactgttctcc-3′; vimentin, 5′-ggggtgtcctcgtcctcctac-3′ and 5′-ggggaggtcaggcttggaaac-3′. ZO-1 wild-type and deletion mutants encoding the PDZ domains (PDZ), the PDZ and the SH3 domains (PS) or the PDZ, SH3 and GUK domains (PSG) were constructed, each carrying a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag (Fig.1). The different cDNAs were subcloned into the pLNCX expression vector and transfected into MDCKI epithelial cells. These cells possess characteristics similar to the principal cells of the collecting systems in the kidney and polarize under appropriate conditions. Compared with the MDCKII cell line, MDCKI cells show a significantly increased TER (28.Nakazato Y. Suzuki H. Saruta T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1014: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,29.Hansson G.C. Simons K. van Meer G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), 2M. Reichert and W. Hunziker, unpublished observations. indicating the formation of well established TJ. After transfection, G418-resistant cells were selected, pooled, and used for further analysis. Immunofluorescence experiments using M2 anti-Flag antibodies showed that the cells in a given pooled population of G418-resistant cells homogeneously expressed the different ZO-1 proteins (data not shown, see below). To characterize the subcellular distribution of the different ZO-1 proteins, cells were grown to confluence and the localization of the tagged proteins was detected by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2 a). In MDCK-ZO-1 cells, the transfected FLAG-tagged wild-type ZO-1 localized at the plasma membrane to regions of cell-cell contact (Fig2 a, panel A), probably the TJ since these cells displayed an increased TER (see below). Similarly, in MDCKI cells transfected with the PSG construct, the expressed protein was present at regions of cell-cell contact (panel C). In contrast, however, deletion mutants lacking the GUK domain no longer localized at the plasma membrane in transfected MDCK-PS cells (data not shown) or MDCK-PDZ cells (panel B). The apparent cytosolic localization of the ZO-1 PDZ construct observed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2 a, panel B) was confirmed biochemically. MDCK-PDZ and MDCK-PSG cells were homogenized in the absence of detergent; cytosol and membrane fractions were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods” and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2 b, the transfected ZO-1 PSG protein was almost exclusively detected in the membrane fraction. In contrast, the ZO-1 PDZ protein was mostly recovered in the cytosolic fraction. This experiment thus confirms the immunofluorescence data and shows that the ZO-1 PDZ protein no longer localizes at the plasma membrane. These results are consistent with previous data (5.Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar) indicating that the GUK domain may be critical for the localization of ZO-1 at the plasma membrane, presumably by binding to occludin. Neither MDCKI cells expressing the wild-type ZO-1 nor cells transfected with the empty pLNCX vector (MDCK-pLNCX) showed apparent changes in morphology when compared with the parental cell line, and the morphology of MDCK-PSG cells was also not altered. Surprisingly, however, the expression of proteins encoding the PDZ domains but lacking the GUK domain led to a dramatic change in the morphology of MDCK-PDZ and MDCK-PS cells (panel B and data not shown). The cells lost their epithelial phenotype and instead displayed a fibroblast-like morphology with long lamellipodia. Alterations in the morphology of MDCK-PDZ cells correlated with changes in the organization of the cytoskeleton. The typical cortical actin ring of polarized epithelial cells was observed in control MDCK-pLNCX cells (Fig. 2 a, panel F). In contrast, MDCK-PDZ cells displayed actin stress fibers normally absent from polarized epithelial cells but characteristic for fibroblastoid or migrating epithelial cells (panel E). Thus, MDCKI cells expressing the PDZ domains of ZO-1 in the cytosol (i.e. ZO-1 PDZ or ZO-PS) underwent profound changes in morphology and cytoskeletal organization. This loss of epithelial polarity and gain of mesenchymal properties was characterized in more detail using MDCK-PDZ cells. To determine whether MDCK-PDZ cells were still able to form monolayers with functional tight junctions, cells were grown on permeable filter supports. As shown in Fig.3 a, control MDCK-pLNCX cells formed tight monolayers as evidenced by the establishment of a TER characteristic for MDCKI cells. MD"
https://openalex.org/W2040460879,"Xanthine oxidase (XO) is a central mechanism of oxidative injury as occurs following ischemia. During the early period of reperfusion, both nitric oxide (NO⋅) and superoxide (O⨪2) generation are increased leading to the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO−); however, questions remain regarding the presence and nature of the interactions of NO⋅ or ONOO− with XO and the role of this process in regulating oxidant generation. Therefore, we determined the dose-dependent effects of NO⋅ and ONOO−on the O⨪2 generation and enzyme activity of XO, respectively, by EPR spin trapping of O⨪2 using 5-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide and spectrophotometric assay. ONOO− markedly inhibited both O⨪2 generation and XO activity in dose-dependent manner, while NO⋅ from NO⋅ gas in concentrations up to 200 μm had no effect. Furthermore, we observed that NO⋅ donors such as NOR-1 also inhibited O⨪2 generation and XO activity; however, these effects were O⨪2-dependent and blocked by superoxide dismutase or ONOO− scavengers. Finally, we found that ONOO− totally abolished the Mo(V) EPR spectrum. These changes were irreversible, suggesting oxidative disruption of the critical molybdenum center of the catalytic site. Thus, ONOO− formed in biological systems can feedback and down-regulate XO activity and O⨪2 generation, which in turn may serve to limit further ONOO− formation.

Xanthine oxidase (XO),1 a metalloflavoprotein, is an important source of oxygen free radicals (1.Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the reduction of O2, leading to the formation of superoxide (O⨪2) and H2O2, and it has been proposed as a central mechanism of oxidative injury (2.McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4941) Google Scholar, 3.Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Lutty G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Both direct and spin trapping EPR techniques have demonstrated markedly increased oxygen free radical generation in tissues, such as heart, following postischemic reperfusion (4.Zweier J.L.

XO has been shown to be the primary source of the oxygen radical generation, with this process largely triggered by increased formation of the XO substrates, xanthine and hypoxanthine, due to ATP degradation during ischemia (2.McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4941) Google Scholar, 7.Abd-Elfattah A.S. Jessen M.E. Lekven J. Doherty N.E.D. Brunsting L.A. Wechsler A.S.

During ischemia and reperfusion, increased nitric oxide (NO⋅) formation also occurs, and this can interact with XO-derived O⨪2, leading to the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (10.Wang P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29223-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). However, questions remain concerning the effects of NO⋅ and ONOO− on XO itself. The free radical, NO⋅ , is generated in biological tissues and is an important regulator of a wide range of biological functions (11.Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). It is of critical importance in modulating vascular tone and was identified as the mediator of endothelium-derived relaxation (12.Furchgott R.F.

NO⋅ also inhibits the enzyme activity of a number of enzymes including gluthathione peroxidase (15.Asahi M. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Seo H.G. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol.

Major mechanisms attributed to explain NO⋅-mediated inhibitory effects involve heme binding or destruction of enzyme Fe-S centers to yield inactive Fe-S-NO derivatives and thiol oxidation (19.Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 20.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown that O⨪2 plays a critical role in NO⋅-induced toxicity, and previously proposed mechanisms for both O⨪2- and NO⋅-mediated tissue injury now include a role for their combined reaction product, ONOO− (21.Tarpey M.M. Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Gore J.Z. Brock T.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The radical-radical reaction between O⨪2 and NO⋅ is extremely fast and almost diffusionally limited in rate (2 × 109m−1 s−1) (22.Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). ONOO− is a potent oxidant that can attack a wide variety of biological molecules and is produced in diverse inflammatory and pathological processes including postischemic injury (10.Wang P.

ONOO− can directly oxidize sulfhydryls (33.Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also reacts by either one- or two-electron oxidation reactions with various biological target molecules (34.Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). In acid conditions, the homolysis of peroxynitrous acid (HOONO) (pK a 6.8) gives reactive intermediates with OH⋅-like properties that can oxidize DNA and proteins (33.Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. 1995; 322: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). ONOO− directly oxidizes an active site methionine, resulting in inactivation of α1-antiprotease (37.Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). During the early period of reperfusion, both NO⋅ and O⨪2generation are increased, leading to formation of ONOO–(10.Wang P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29223-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Following the postischemic burst of ONOO−generation, it has been observed that XO activity is decreased in the early period of reperfusion in heart tissue (9.Xia Y. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18797-18803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that either NO⋅ or ONOO− could feedback and inhibit XO, however, controversy remains regarding the presence and nature of interactions of NO⋅ or ONOO− with XO and the role of this process in regulating oxidant generation. NO⋅ could inhibit and regulate endothelial cell xanthine dehydrogenase/XO activity (38.Hassoun P.M., Yu, F.S. Zulueta J.J. White A.C. Lanzillo J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L809-L817PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Cote C.G., Yu, F.S. Zulueta J.J. Vosatka R.J. Hassoun P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L869-L874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a recent paper reported that XO and xanthine dehydrogenase are inactivated by NO⋅ under anaerobic conditions (40.Ichimori K. Fukahori M. Nakazawa H. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7763-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, other studies reported that ONOO−inactivates the enzyme, while NO⋅ has no effect (41.Houston M. Chumley P. Radi R. Rubbo H. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To resolve the controversy regarding the effects of NO⋅ and ONOO− on XO activity, we have determined the dose-dependent effects of NO⋅ and ONOO−on XO activity and O⨪2 generation from purified XO. EPR spin trapping techniques were applied to quantitate O⨪2. We demonstrate that ONOO− induces a dose-dependent loss of activity, while its precursor NO⋅ does not. The mechanism of this inactivation is further shown to be due to disruption of the critical molybdenum center of the enzyme. XO (grade III; from buttermilk, chromatographically purified, in 2.3 m(NH4)2SO4, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm sodium salicylate) was obtained from Sigma. The salicylate was removed chromatographically with Sephadex G-25 prior to use. Xanthine, uric acid, and superoxide dismutase were also obtained from Sigma. The ONOO− decomposition catalyst (5,10,15,20-tetrakis(2,4,6-trimethyl-3,3-disulfonatophenyl)porphyrinato Fe(III) (FeTMPS) was obtained from Monsanto Corp. (St Louis, MO). The NO⋅ donor NOR-1 was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The ONOO− was synthesized from acidified nitrite and hydrogen peroxide according to Beckman et al. (34.Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Alternatively, similarly prepared ONOO− was obtained from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). The concentration of ONOO− was checked by optical absorbance measurements at 302 nm at the time of synthesis and again just prior to each experiment, and only ONOO− that was >95% of the original concentration was used. To assure that there was no significant pH change upon the addition of alkaline ONOO−to the reaction mixture, we also monitored the pH and limited the amount of alkaline ONOO− stock used so that the final pH did not significantly change. NO⋅ was scrubbed of higher nitrogen oxides by passage through a trap with solid NaOH pellets and a second trap with 1 m deaerated (bubbled with argon for 30 min) NaOH solution. 500 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), was deaerated by bubbling with argon for 30 min and then bubbled with scrubbed NO⋅ for 30 min (42.Liu X. Miller M.J.S. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 43.Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S.

To further verify the precise NO⋅ concentration from NO⋅ gas-equilibrated solution, electrochemical measurements of NO⋅ concentrations were carried out at 25 °C using a CHI 832 electrochemical detector with a Faraday Cage (CH Instruments, Inc., Cordova, IN) and WPI NO⋅electrode. UV-visible absorption spectra of XO and assays of XO activity were performed with a Varian Cary 300 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlled circulator. To remove the salicylate and other low molecular weight compounds, XO (0.1 μm) was passaged through Sephadex G-25 preequilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4. XO activity was assayed at 25 °C in PBS after the addition of xanthine (360 μm) by measurement of uric acid production from the absorbance change at 295 nm (e = 37,800m−1 cm−1). We determined the effects of ONOO−, NO⋅, and NOR-1 on XO activity as follows. We confirmed that the various concentrations of the alkaline ONOO− stock used were neutralized to pH 7.4 and quantitated the ONOO− concentration spectrophotometrically at 302 nm. As previously reported, ONOO− rapidly decays at pH 7.4 with a half-life of <1 s (34.Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), and after 1 min no detectable ONOO− remains. Therefore, ONOO− (0–200 μm) was added with a gas-tight syringe to the XO reaction mixture in PBS, and after 1 min the reaction mixture was transferred to the spectrophotometer cuvette, and xanthine (360 μm) was added for measurement of enzyme activity. Dissolved NO⋅ gas solutions were used to determine the effects of NO⋅ on XO activity. The dissolved NO⋅ gas (0–200 μm) was preincubated with XO for 10 min in 0.1 m PBS (pH 7.4), after which xanthine was added, and enzyme activity was measured. Electrode measurements confirmed that after a 10-min preincubation, no detectable NO⋅ remained, ensuring that NO⋅ would not significantly scavenge O⨪2 generated from the XO-xanthine system. For the NO⋅ donor NOR-1, the NOR-1 (0–100 μm) and xanthine were added simultaneously to the XO reaction mixture in 0.1 m PBS, and the rate of uric acid production was immediately measured. For the anaerobic experiments, ONOO− (100 μm) and NO⋅ (100 μm) were added to the XO reaction mixture under argon for 10 min. After continued argon purging to remove any remaining NO⋅, the enzyme activity was measured with the addition of xanthine (360 μm) and exposure to air. Anaerobic solutions of the reaction buffer with XO, ONOO−, and xanthine were prepared by purging with argon prior to use. All EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker ER 300 spectrometer operating at X-band with a TM110 cavity. The microwave frequency was measured with an EIP model 575 microwave counter (EIP Microwave, Inc., San Jose, CA). To determine O⨪2 generation, EPR spin trapping studies were performed using the spin trap 5-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DEPMPO) (44.Roubaud V. Sankarapandi S. Kuppusamy P. Tordo P. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The instrument settings used in the spin trapping experiments were as follows: modulation amplitude, 0.32 G; time constant, 0.16 s; scan time, 60 s; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; microwave frequency, 9.76 GHz. The samples were placed in a quartz EPR flat cell, and spectra were recorded at ambient temperature (25 °C). The component signals observed in these spectra were identified and quantified as reported (46.Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1961; 73: 189-195Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The double integrals of DEPMPO-OOH experimental spectra were compared with those of a 1 μm TEMPO sample measured under identical settings to estimate the concentration of O⨪2 adduct. Measurements of the Mo(V) EPR signal of XO were performed as follows. The samples of native XO (10 μm), XO plus xanthine, ONOO−-treated XO, ONOO−-treated XO plus xanthine (360 μm), and ONOO−-treated XO plus dithionite (1 mm) were prepared as described (45.Malthouse J.P. Williams J.W. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (700 μl) in bicine buffer (pH 8.2) was frozen in a 3-mm quartz EPR tube and measured at 77 K. The instrument settings were as follows: modulation amplitude, 5.0 G; time constant, 0.32 s; scan time, 60 s; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; microwave power, 10 milliwatts; microwave frequency, 9.54 GHz. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated a minimum of three times. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test or a one-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was defined at a level of p < 0.05. We investigated the effects of ONOO− and NO⋅ on XO-mediated O⨪2 generation measured by EPR spin trapping with DEPMPO. XO activity was assayed under these same experimental conditions. As reported previously (44.Roubaud V. Sankarapandi S. Kuppusamy P. Tordo P. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), after the addition of xanthine to XO, we observe primarily a characteristic DEPMPO-OOH adduct spectrum with hyperfine splitting giving rise to 12 resolved peaks (Fig.1 A, a). In addition to the large signal of DEPMPO-OOH, a small signal of DEPMPO−OH was observed. The O⨪2-derived DEPMPO-OOH adduct comprised 92% of the total intensity, and the DEPMPO-OH adduct comprised 8%. With ONOO− (100 μm) pretreatment of XO and the subsequent addition of xanthine, the DEPMPO−OOH signal was decreased by more than 5-fold, and a larger signal of DEPMPO−OH was seen (Fig.1 A, b). These data indicate that ONOO− markedly inhibits O⨪2 generation from XO and either forms OH⋅ or hydroxylates DEPMPO in this system. With NO⋅ treatment, however, no alterations in the EPR spectrum were seen with identical DEPMPO−OOH (92%) and DEPMPO−OH (8%) spin adducts as in the absence of NO⋅ (Fig.2 A). Measurements of XO activity confirmed that ONOO− strongly inactivated the enzyme with decreased initial rates of uric acid formation (Fig.1 B, b), while NO⋅ had no effect (Fig.2 B, b). The dose-dependent effects of ONOO− and NO⋅ on O⨪2 generation and XO activity were measured (Fig. 3). It was clearly observed that ONOO− decreased both O⨪2generation and XO activity in a dose-dependent manner with more than 25, 50, and 90% inhibition with ONOO− levels of 10, 30, and 200 μm, respectively (Fig. 3 A); however, NO⋅ in concentrations up to 200 μm did not decrease either O⨪2 generation or XO activity (Fig.3 B).Figure 2Effect of NO⋅ on the O⨪2generation and activity of XO.

It was previously reported that NO⋅ released from NO⋅ donors can inhibit XO function (38.Hassoun P.M., Yu, F.S. Zulueta J.J. White A.C. Lanzillo J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L809-L817PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Cote C.G., Yu, F.S. Zulueta J.J. Vosatka R.J. Hassoun P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L869-L874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, it is unknown if this effect is mediated by NO⋅ or ONOO−generated from the reaction of NO⋅ with XO-derived O⨪2. The time course of NO⋅ release from NOR-1 was measured by the NO⋅ electrode (see “Experimental Procedures”). In contrast to NO⋅ gas, with which a rapid fall in NO⋅ concentration to near zero within 10 min is observed, with NOR-1, NO⋅concentrations in solution initially increase and then persist for more than 15 min (Fig. 4). When NOR-1 was added to XO and this was immediately followed by the addition of xanthine, a dose-dependent inhibition of O⨪2generation and XO activity was observed (Figs.5 and6 A). With NOR-1 concentrations of 100 μm, more than 50% inhibition was seen. This inhibition by 100 μm NOR-1 was completely blocked by superoxide dismutase (250 units/ml) (Fig. 6 B), the ONOO− scavenger urate (10 μm) (Fig.7 A), or the ONOO−decomposition catalyst FeTMPS (10 μm) (Fig.7 B). In similar experiments in which NOR-1 was preincubated with XO for 2 h, a time sufficient for total NO⋅ release and decay, no inhibition of subsequent O⨪2 generation or XO activity occurred (data not shown). Thus, the inhibition of XO function was mediated by ONOO− (Figs. 6 and 7), and EPR measurements demonstrate that the inhibition by the NO⋅ donor on XO activity occurs only when NO⋅ continues to be released at the time of O⨪2 generation from the XO-xanthine system (Figs. 4 and5).Figure 5Effect of the NO⋅ donor NOR-1 on the O⨪2 generation and activity of XO.

Since NO⋅ from gas-equilibrated solution (≤200 μm) did not significantly decrease XO activity under aerobic conditions, we examined effects of NO⋅ and ONOO− on enzyme activity under anaerobic conditions. Similar to the results under aerobic conditions, only ONOO–significantly decreased XO activity, while there was no significant effect on enzyme activity with NO⋅ preexposure (Fig. 8). To examine the effects of ONOO− on the critical molybdenum center of XO, EPR measurements were performed on frozen enzyme at 77 K. In the oxidized state, the molybdenum is present as Mo(VI), which is EPR-silent; however, with reduction to Mo(V), various EPR signals have been reported (45.Malthouse J.P. Williams J.W. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 46.Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1961; 73: 189-195Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 47.Bray R.C. Palmer G. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2667-2676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Bray R.C. Lowe D.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Studies of the Mo(V) EPR signal of XO have provided important information regarding the mechanism of enzyme catalysis and have shown that the oxidative hydroxylation of xanthine to uric acid takes place at the molybdenum center. As previously reported, we observe that native XO exhibits the rapid signal Mo(V) EPR spectrum (Fig. 9 B) in Bicine buffer (pH 8.2), and the intensity of this signal further increases after the addition of xanthine (Fig. 9 C) (45.Malthouse J.P. Williams J.W. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Following the addition of ONOO−, however, the rapid signal of the Mo(V) EPR spectrum is almost totally abolished (Fig. 9 D). The loss of this signal could not be reversed by the addition of xanthine (Fig.9 E) or dithionite (Fig. 9 F). These observations suggest that ONOO− irreversibly oxidizes and disrupts the molybdenum center of XO. XO is an important source of oxygen free radicals in biological cells and tissues and has a particularly important role in oxygen radical generation and pathogenesis of injury following postischemic reperfusion (2.McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4941) Google Scholar). More recently, we have also demonstrated that there is markedly increased NO⋅ generation and accumulation in ischemic and postischemic tissues, such as the heart, and this NO⋅ reacts with O⨪2 generated during the early period of reperfusion, resulting in the formation of ONOO− (10.Wang P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29223-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). However, questions and controversy remain regarding whether NO⋅ or ONOO− modulate XO function and XO-mediated free radical generation. Most prior studies assessed the effects of NO⋅ and ONOO− on XO activity measured by urate production; however, there was a lack of direct monitoring of the concentrations of NO⋅ present along with the process of XO-mediated O⨪2generation. This has led to the present controversy and confusion regarding the role of NO⋅ and ONOO− on XO function. Therefore, we have performed studies to assess the effects of NO⋅ and ONOO− on XO activity and O⨪2generation using electrochemical and EPR methods to monitor NO⋅concentrations and O⨪2 generation directly. Our studies provide direct evidence that ONOO− down-regulates O⨪2generation from XO. ONOO− was shown to decrease both XO activity and O⨪2 generation in a dose-dependent manner, while NO⋅ had no significant effect (Fig. 3). We found that NO⋅ does not directly inactivate XO but must first react with O⨪2 to form ONOO− (Fig. 3). Since in the process of assaying XO activity with the addition of xanthine or other substrates the enzyme generates O⨪2, any NO⋅present at the time of enzyme activation can be converted to ONOO−. Although the NO⋅ donor NOR-1 is reported to provide rapid release of NO⋅, this release was measured to persist for more than 10 min as determined by either polarigraphic electrode or EPR spin trapping methods. While NO⋅ itself was ineffective even at 200 μm concentrations, the much lower but more sustained NO⋅ concentrations, <5 μm, provided by the NO⋅ donor were effective in inhibiting O⨪2 generation and XO activity (Figs. 5 and 6). This NOR-1-mediated XO inhibition was prevented by either superoxide dismutase, the ONOO− scavenger urate, or the ONOO− decomposition catalyst FeTMPS (Figs. 6 and 7). When prolonged periods of time were allowed to assure full decomposition of NOR-1 and NO⋅ decay prior to the addition of xanthine to the enzyme, no inhibition was seen. Thus, the NOR-1-mediated XO inhibition was associated with ONOO− formation from the reaction of O⨪2 formed by the XO-xanthine system and NO⋅ released from NOR-1. We further investigated the effects of ONOO− on the structure of the critical molybdenum center. ONOO−treatment resulted in a near total and irreversible loss of the rapid signal Mo(V) EPR spectrum, indicating oxidative disruption of the molybdenum center (Fig. 9). The near total loss of this spectrum correlated with the loss of enzyme activity, indicating that oxidative disruption of the molybdenum was the basis for the loss of enzyme function. A recent study reported that NO⋅ reacts with reduced XO and converts the enzyme to the inactive desulfo-form under anaerobic conditions (40.Ichimori K. Fukahori M. Nakazawa H. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7763-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Since NO⋅ rapidly decomposes by reaction with oxygen under aerobic conditions (Fig. 4), this could limit the effect of NO⋅ on XO if this reaction with the enzyme proceeds at a slow rate. We observed under aerobic conditions that little if any inhibition of XO occurred with NO⋅ added at initial concentrations of up to 200 μm. The inhibition of the reduced enzyme, however, could be in part the result of ONOO− formation upon exposure of the reduced enzyme to oxygen and xanthine at the time of the assay of XO activity. If NO⋅ was present at the time of reoxygenation or the addition of xanthine, ONOO− would be formed as was the case with the NO⋅ donor NOR-1. The physiological or pathophysiological relevance of the modulation of XO function by ONOO− or NO⋅ can be considered in view of the levels of ONOO− required to modulate XO function. It was observed that ONOO− concentrations greater than 10 μm exerted prominent effects on the function of XO, while NO⋅ concentrations of up to 200 μm had no effect. Furthermore, with NO⋅ donors that resulted in a low level flux of a more sustained production of ONOO−, it was observed that solution NO⋅concentrations of less than 1 μm were sufficient to inhibit XO function when present at the time when XO is activated by its substrate xanthine to produce O⨪2. Thus, a low level flux of ONOO− formation was sufficient to inhibit the enzyme. Since NO⋅ concentrations of 0.1 μm or more occur in postischemic organs or following sepsis or inflammation (49.Zweier J.L. Wang P. Kuppusamy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 304-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 50.Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), it is likely that ONOO− formation would feedback and regulate O⨪2 generation from XO. With ONOO− generated from O⨪2 released from the active site of XO, high local concentrations would be produced near the critical molybdenum and other catalytic centers. Thus, XO function could be particularly sensitive to feedback regulation by the ONOO− derived in part from the enzyme. This could serve a critical function to regulate oxidative tissue injury. It is interesting to also consider that the XO product, uric acid, is an effective ONOO− scavenger so that under conditions with loss of perfusion and stasis this XO product could scavenge ONOO−, limiting this feedback regulation. From prior data in the literature, one can consider if this ONOO−-mediated regulation of XO function may actually occur in biological tissues. We have previously observed in the isolated rat heart with reintroduction of flow following ischemia that there is increased generation of O⨪2 from XO as well as NO⋅ from nitric-oxide synthase or nitrite reduction leading to a burst of ONOO− formation during the early minutes of reflow (5.Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1353-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Wang P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we previously observed that while XO activity is initially increased during ischemia, a 30% decline in XO activity occurs during reperfusion at a time following the burst of reperfusion-associated ONOO− generation (9.Xia Y. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18797-18803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,10.Wang P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29223-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). This suggests that ONOO−-mediated regulation of XO does occur in postischemic tissues. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ONOO− inhibits the O⨪2 generation and activity of XO in a dose-dependent manner, while NO⋅ only exerts significant inhibition in the presence of O⨪2 under conditions in which ONOO− is formed. This ONOO−-mediated XO inhibition could be suppressed by urate. ONOO−inhibited XO function primarily by oxidative disruption of the molybdenum catalytic site. Taken together, ONOO− in biological systems can feedback and down-regulate XO activity that in turn may serve to limit further ONOO− formation and oxidant-derived injury. We thank Dr. P. Kuppusamy, Dr. A. Samouilov, Dr. A. F. Vanin, and Dr. Russ Hille for helpful advice."

In the 1C11 serotonergic cell line andMastomys natalensis carcinoid cells, which naturally express the 5-HT2B receptor, as well as in transfected LMTK− fibroblasts, stimulation of the 5-HT2Breceptor triggers intracellular cGMP production through dual activation of constitutive nitric-oxide synthase (cNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS).

The occurrence of a direct functional coupling between the receptor and cNOS activity is supported by highly significant correlations between the binding constants of drugs on the receptor and their effects on cNOS activity. The 5-HT2B/iNOS coupling mechanisms appear more complex because neutralization of endogenous Gα13 by specific antibodies cancels the cellular iNOS response while not interfering with cNOS activities.

So far, the diversity of 5-HT receptors and the lack of specific pharmacological tools have impaired the investigation of the precise roles of these proteins in the signaling networks that mediate 5-HT physiological functions. This is particularly true in the case of the 5-HT2B receptor, which, like all the 15 known mammalian 5-HT receptor subtypes but one (5-HT3), belongs to the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 5-HT2B receptors cDNA were cloned from the rat stomach fundus, mouse brain, human liver, and neuroblastoma cell lines (see Ref. 3.Baxter G.S. Kennett G. Blaney F. Blackburn T.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar for review). The 5-HT2B receptor could be expressed either by transfection or endogeneously during the serotonergic neuronal differentiation of 1C11 cells, referred to as 1C11*/5HT cells (4.Loric S. Maroteaux L. Kellermann O. Launay J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 458-466PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Tournois C. Mutel V. Manivet P. Launay J.-M. Kellermann O. J. Biol.

In both cases, the receptor couples with PIP2 hydrolysis, similarly to the two other members (5-HT2A and 5-HT2C) of the 5-HT2 receptor family. In contrast, the 5-HT2B receptor stimulation fails to stimulate PIP2 hydrolysis in rat fundus (6.Cox D.A. Cohen M.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Accordingly, 5-HT2B-dependent activations of both the ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (8.Launay J.-M. Birraux G. Bondoux D. Callebert J. Choi D.S. Loric S. Maroteaux L. J. Biol.

The possibility that NO, a major messenger molecule in the cardiovascular, immune, and nervous systems (see Ref. 9.Schmidt H.H.W.H. Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar for review), may behave as a signaling effector associated to the 5-HT2B receptor, is suggested by data obtained in rat vasculature (7.Ellis E.S.

Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The present work provides biochemical evidence for a functional link between NO signaling and the 5-HT2B receptor. NO synthase (NOS), the enzyme responsible for NO synthesis, occurs as three distinct isoforms (11.Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two isoforms are constitutive (cNOS), and their activities are dependent upon the calcium-calmodulin complex. One is expressed in some neurones (13.Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (2671) Google Scholar) and in skeletal muscles (14.Nakane M. Schmidt H.H. Pollock J.S. Forstermann U. Murad F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). It corresponds to the neuronal isoform (NOS-1). The other is the endothelial isoform (NOS-3), abundant in endothelial and epithelial cells (15.Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The third NOS isoform is calcium-independent and inducible (iNOS or NOS-2) (11.Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). It responds to endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria or inflammatory cytokines in a wide variety of cells (most notably in macrophages, glia, or vascular cells). Here, we show that both cNOS and iNOS contribute to NO production upon 5-HT2Breceptor activation in the murine serotonergic lC11*/5HTcells (4.Loric S. Maroteaux L. Kellermann O. Launay J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 458-466PubMed Google Scholar) or in Mastomys natalensis carcinoid tumor primary cultured cells (16.Ganem Y.J. Callebert J. Darmon M.C. Lasneret J. Hosoda S. Mallet J. Launay J.M.

These two in vitro systems, which naturally express 5-HT2B receptors within a complete serotonergic phenotype, allow NO couplings to be studied under conditions close to in vivo physiological situations. The PDZ domains present in a diverse family of structural proteins and enzymes such as cNOS appear to be important elements in protein-protein interactions at the plasma membrane. Interactions between proteins containing either PDZ domains or PDZ recognition motifs are assumed to mediate formation of macromolecular signaling complexes (see Ref. 17.Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholarfor review). For instance, in rat cerebellum and forebrain (18.Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar), the resulting multiprotein clusters contribute to the functional coupling of the NMDA receptor to NOS-1 activity. PDZ target motifs typically consist of 4–11 amino acid residues at the extreme C terminus of the target protein (17.Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a group I PDZ motif, VSYI(D/E), is present at the C terminus of the 5-HT2B receptor. This led us to examine the role of this motif in NO signaling pathways. In mouse LMTK− fibroblasts stably transfected with the full-length cDNA encoding the mouse 5-HT2B receptor (LM6 cells), a 5-HT2B-NO coupling mediated by cNOS and iNOS is observed. Instead, if the transfected cDNA expresses a C-truncated form of the receptor (LM5 cells), NO production is fully abolished. An involvement of the 5-HT2B PDZ target domain in the coupling to cNOS and iNOS could be further indicated upon introduction, in the three cell types studied, of a 20-amino acid competitor peptide whose sequence corresponds to the C terminus of the 5-HT2B receptor. In all cases, the peptide abolished the 5-HT2B-dependent NO production. The observation that the 5-HT2B-NOSs coupling is canceled in LMTK− fibroblasts expressing a 5-HT2B receptor with a point mutation in the VSYI(D/E) motif (LMTK−-VSSI cells) confirms the implication of the PDZ domain of the receptor in its coupling to cNOS and iNOS. The ability of G proteins to directly regulate NO production remains largely to be elucidated. One recent report indicates a regulation of iNOS expression by Gα13 in an epithelial renal cell line (19.Kitamura K. Singer W.D. Star R.A. Muallem S. Miller R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7412-7415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and suggests that proinflammatory agents such as thrombin or thromboxane might induce cellular responses similar to those initiated by bacterial endotoxins or cytokines. In the present study, we observed that introduction of anti-Gα13 antibodies in either LM6, 1C11*/5HT or Mastomys permeabilized cells systematically blocked the 5-HT2B receptor-mediated iNOS activation. Altogether, these findings highlight novel GPCR-dependent regulations of NO production. Dibutyryl cAMP and cyclohexane carboxylic acid were from Sigma-Aldrich. Neurochemicals were from RBI (Natick, MA). All other chemicals, of the purest grade available, were from classical commercial sources. [125I]-(±)-1-(2,5-di-methoxy-4-iodophenyl-2)aminopropane ([125I]DOI) (81.4 TBq/mmol),l-[3H]arginine (1.84 TBqlmmol), andl-[14C]citrulline (1.73 GBqlmmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. The Thermus aquaticus polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer. The peptide sequence LDTLLTENDGDKAEEQVSYI corresponding to the 20 amino acids at the C terminus of the mouse 5-HT2B receptor, as well as peptides harboring mutated versions of the VSYI motif were synthesized and purified by Dr Lam (Hoffmann-LaRoche A.G., Basel). Rabbit antisera against rodent Gαs (C-18), Gαi (C-20), Gαq/11 (C-19) and Gα13 (A-20) as well as the corresponding blocking peptide are from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). To avoid any interfering iNOS induction because of cytokines or undefined components of the media, all cell types were grown, as previously reported (5.Tournois C. Mutel V. Manivet P. Launay J.-M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17498-17503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in a serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) with 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 30 nm selenium, 20 nm progesterone, and 100 μm putrescine).M. natalensis carcinoid tumor primary cultured cells were obtained as previously reported (16.Ganem Y.J. Callebert J. Darmon M.C. Lasneret J. Hosoda S. Mallet J. Launay J.M. Dreux C. Biog. Amines. 1989; 6: 495-511Google Scholar). 1C11 progenitor cells were grown and induced to differentiate toward the serotonergic pathway in the presence of 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP and 0.05% cyclohexane carboxylic acid (20.Buc-Caron M.H. Launay J.M. Lamblin D. Kellermann O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on 1C11 serotonergic cells 2 days after addition of the inducers (1C11*/5HTcells, (4.Loric S. Maroteaux L. Kellermann O. Launay J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 458-466PubMed Google Scholar)). Mouse LMTK− fibroblasts, lacking 5-HT receptors and thus nonresponsive to DOI stimulation, were stably transfected with cDNA encoding either the full-length (LM6 cells) or a truncated (LM5 cells) mouse 5-HT2B receptor and cloned. The 5-HT2B receptor expressed in LM5 cells was deleted for 77 amino acid residues of the C-terminal domain from amino acid 403. LMTK− cells were also transfected with a cDNA encoding the full-length 5-HT2B receptor harboring a point mutation in the VSYI motif (LMTK−-VSSI). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and exposed to 1 hemolytic unit of alveolysin/106 cells at 37 °C under agitation (21.Berthou L. Corvaia N. Geoffroy C. Mutel V. Launay J.M. Alouf J.E. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 377-382PubMed Google Scholar). Alveolysin was purified fromBacillus alvei as described (22.Geoffroy C. Alouf J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9968-9972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One hemolytic unit is equivalent to ∼1 ng of protein (193 pmol). Radioligand binding experiments were performed as previously detailed (4.Loric S. Maroteaux L. Kellermann O. Launay J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 458-466PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). LM6, 1C11*/5HT clones, and Mastomys cells expressed 178 ± 16, 107 ± 12, and 128 ± 14 fmol of 5-HT2B receptor/mg of protein, respectively, as measured by [125I]DOI binding. LM5 and LMTK−-VSSI clones expressed 137 ± 21 and 124 ± 25 fmol of 5-HT2Breceptor/mg of protein, respectively. It is noteworthy that theB max value measured for Mastomyscells may be underestimated and may not accurately reflect the number of 5-HT2B binding sites/cell because measurements are performed on primary cultures of carcinoid tumors. The presence of 5-HT1B/D receptors onto 1C11*/5HT cells led us to use [125I]DOI as 5-HT2B receptor radioligand instead of [3H]serotonin. Cells were washed twice in fresh serum-free medium and incubated for various times at 37 °C with l00 μm isobutylmethylxanthine and test agents. The reaction was stopped by aspiration of the medium followed by addition of 500 μl ice-cold 95% ethanol/5% formic acid (1:1, v/v). After 1 h at 4 °C, the ethanolic phase was collected and lyophilized. cGMP was quantified using an iodinated radio immunoassay kit (cGMP RIA kit RPA 525, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were washed twice with fresh serum-free medium and incubated for various times at 37 °C with 100 nm DOI. After incubation, cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped with a rubber policeman. Intracellular IP3 levels were then measured radioimmunologically as previously detailed (4.Loric S. Maroteaux L. Kellermann O. Launay J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 458-466PubMed Google Scholar). NOS activity was measured by monitoring the conversion of tritium-labeled l-arginine to tritium-labeledl-citrulline as described previously (24.Bush P.A. Gonzalez N.E. Griscavage J.M. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice in fresh serum-free medium and incubated for various times at 37 °C with l00 nm DOI and test agents. The reaction was stopped by aspiration of the medium, followed by addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.40, 1.15% KCl (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm glucose, 0.1 mmdl-dithiothreitol, 200 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 2 mg/liter pepstatin A, 10 mg/liter trypsin inhibitor, and 44 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were scraped and lysed by sonication. Cell cytosols were prepared by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cytosols (30 μl) were incubated in the presence and absence of nitro-l-arginine (1 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C with l-[3H]arginine (1 μm; 1 μCi), 1 mm NADPH, 15 μm(6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin, 1 μm flavine-adenine dinucleotide, and 1 μmcalmodulin in 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.40) containing 1 mmdl-dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.25 mm CaCl2 (final volume, 150 μl). The incubations were quenched by the addition, for 5 min at 4 °C, of 1 ml of ice-cold 100 mm HEPES buffer (pH 5.50) containing 10 mm EGTA and 500 mg of AG 50W-X8 (counter-ion Na+) cation exchange resin, followed by a 5-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g.l-[3H]Citrulline in the supernatant was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Specific NOS activity was calculated as the nitro-l-arginine-sensitive formation ofl-[3H]citrulline/min/mg of protein.l-Citrulline was quantitatively recovered by this batch assay as determined by usingl-[14C]citrulline. In parallel experiments, cell cytosols were incubated in Ca2+-free buffer to determine Ca2+-independent NOS (iNOS) activities. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with oligo(dT)17 primer, using 200 units Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 20-μl reaction volume for 1 h at 37 °C. Primer pairs specific for murine NOS isoforms were selected with the aid of the Oligo 4.0 Primer Design Software (National Biosciences Inc., Plymouth, Minn.). Polylinker sequences in the primers are underlined. NOS-1 (accession number D14552, amplified product 2208–2807), 5′-GTCGAATTCTGAGTACCAGCCTGATCCATGGAA-3′ (sense), 5′-CGCGGATCCTCCAGGAGAGTGTCCACTGCGTG-3′ (antisense); NOS-2 (accession number 87039, amplified product 1946–2171), 5′-CTGCATGGACCAGTATAAGGCAAGC-3′ (sense), 5′-AGCTTCTGGTCGATGTCATGAGCAA-3′ (antisense); NOS-3 (accession numberU53142, amplified product 877–2615), 5′-GTCGAATTCTTGGCGGCGCAAGAGGAAGGAGTC-3′ (sense), 5′-CGCGGATCCAGGACTAGGCGGGGAAGTGATGTC-3′ (antisense). PCR reactions were performed using the Gene-Amp kit (Perkin-Elmer) in a 50-μl volume containing 2 μl of the reverse transcription products (40 cycles, 60 °C). PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels. NOS-2 mRNA steady state levels were monitored during 1 h upon 5-HT2B receptor activation by real-time RNA quantification (25.Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (4940) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced into the wild-type mouse 5-HT2BR cDNA by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described previously (26.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). A single-stranded uracil-containing DNA template was generated in Escherichia coli CJ236 (dut−, ung−) (Invitrogen) using R408 helper phage. Using oligonucleotides encoding the mutations, the following mutations were introduced: m5-HT2B Y478S and R403del. Identity of the mutant cDNAs was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using a Sequenase II kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To verify the absence of additional mutations in the parental cDNAs, rescue constructs of all mutations were constructed and tested for recovery of NOS activations. In all cases, the rescue constructs demonstrated wild-type NOS couplings (data not shown), confirming that the disruption of NOS couplings observed for both mutants resulted from the mutations. The statistical analyses on small groups were performed using nonparametric tests. The significance criterion of p < 0.05 was adopted. All values are given as the arithmetic means ± S.E. Most of the transductional actions of NO are mediated through an activation of cytosolic guanylate cyclases with concomitant increase of cellular cGMP (27.Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Thus, we first examined whether exposure of 5-HT2Breceptor-expressing cells (i.e. Mastomys, 1C11*/5HT, and LM6 cells) to DOI, a specific agonist of 5-HT2 receptors, triggered cGMP formation. All cells were grown in serum-free cultures to preclude signaling interferences mediated by cytokines or undefined serum components. As shown in Fig.1 A, saturation of the receptor with 100 nm DOI resulted in an accumulation of cGMP observable after 10 min in all three cell types. The increase in cGMP was lower in 1C11*/5HT and LM6 cells than inMastomys cells. The elevated response of Mastomyscells can be related to the overexpression of 5-HT2Breceptors in these carcinoid tumoral cells, as previously evidenced by anti-5-HT2B antibodies (8.Launay J.-M. Birraux G. Bondoux D. Callebert J. Choi D.S. Loric S. Maroteaux L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3141-3147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It may also reflect cell type-specific features of the 5-HT2B receptor-mediated signaling responses. Indeed, as observed in rat fundus (6.Cox D.A. Cohen M.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar),Mastomys 5-HT2B receptors do not couple to PLCβ, whereas DOI treatment (100 nm) activates PIP2 hydrolysis in both LM6 and 1C11*/5HT cells (Fig. 1 B). The DOI-induced cGMP formation observed for the three cell types supports the idea of a 5-HT2B-NO coupling. We therefore decided to search for the occurrence of a DOI-mediated NOS activation. To assess the contributions of Ca2+-dependent NOSs (cNOS) and/or Ca2+-independent iNOS to NO synthesis in the different cell systems, NOS activities were monitored in cell lysates in the presence or absence of calcium ions. In each cell investigated, activation of 5-HT2B receptors by 100 nm DOI resulted in a time-dependent increase in both cNOS (Fig.2 A) and iNOS (Fig.2 B) activities. cNOS activity becomes maximal 5–15 min after addition of the agonist. Noticeably, the enhancement of cNOS activity lasts longer in Mastomys cells than in the two other strains. This discrepancy is consistent with the high level of cGMP accumulating in Mastomys cells (Fig. 1 A). In the absence of agonist stimulation, low levels of cNOS activity were measured in all three cell lysates but not in LMTK−untransfected cells. These levels might thus reflect a constitutive basal activity of the 5-HT2B receptor. Such a basal activity has already been observed for its PLCβ (4.Loric S. Maroteaux L. Kellermann O. Launay J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 458-466PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar),ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (8.Launay J.-M. Birraux G. Bondoux D. Callebert J. Choi D.S. Loric S. Maroteaux L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3141-3147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and phospholipase A2 (5.Tournois C. Mutel V. Manivet P. Launay J.-M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17498-17503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) couplings. It is noteworthy that DOI-mediated 5-HT2B stimulation also induces a rapid and transient increase of iNOS activity (Fig.2 B). Activation of iNOS is only very shortly delayed (lag is about 5 min or less) with respect to cNOS activation. This extremely rapid activation of iNOS is reproducibly observed in all three cell types. It contrasts with the iNOS activation by proinflammatory agents, for which the time of response ranges between 3 h (28.Bateson A.N. Jakiwczyk O.M. Schulz R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 303: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and up to several days. In all three cell types, iNOS mRNA steady state levels were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR and could be observed not to vary (data not shown). This suggests that 5-HT2B-mediated iNOS activation depends on post-transcriptional controls. The distinct NOS isoforms expressed in each cell type were further characterized through reverse transcription PCR experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, all three cell types contain transcripts encoding iNOS (NOS-2) and either of the two cNOS (NOS-1 or NOS-3) isoforms. As expected, NOS-1 mRNA is present in 1C11*/5HT neural-like cells and in Mastomysneuroendocrine cells, whereas NOS-3 mRNA can only be detected in LM6 fibroblasts, which, like endothelial cells, have a mesodermal origin. The functional relation between the 5-HT2B receptor and NOS activities could be further evidenced by examining the effects of a series of known agonists or antagonists on both DOI binding and NOS activities. Their binding to the receptor was assessed through competition with DOI, and the corresponding IC50 values were determined.K i values were deduced using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (29.Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12132) Google Scholar). The dose-response effect of agonists on NOS activities could be directly followed. In the case of antagonists, effects were estimated through the capacity of each drug to inhibit the DOI- dependent stimulation of NOS activities. For the three cells studied, highly significant correlations (r s = 0.976, n = 8,p < 0.01) were found between the 5-HT2Breceptor binding constants of the drugs, and the apparent equilibrium constants deduced from their effect on cNOS activities (NOS-1 was followed in Mastomys (Fig.4 A) and 1C11*/5HT (Fig. 4 B) cells; NOS-3 was followed in LM6 fibroblasts; Fig. 4 C). Such pharmacological correlations strongly support the occurrence of a direct functional coupling between the 5-HT2B receptor and cNOS activity. With the same set of drugs, lower but still significant correlations (r s = 0.643, n = 8,p < 0.05) were found in the case of iNOS activity in either Mastomys (Fig. 4 D) or 1C11*/5HT (Fig. 4 E) serotonergic cells. Using LM6 fibroblasts, the correlation did not reach significance (Fig.4 F, rs = 0.571, n = 8,p > 0.05). We conclude from these observations that coupling of the 5-HT2B receptor to the iNOS activity most likely follows more complex mechanisms than those involved in the cNOS coupling and that these mechanisms may vary with the cell context. In the central nervous system, the NMDA receptor-mediated stimulation of NOS-1 occurs via PDZ-PDZ interactions (18.Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Like the NR2 subunit of the NMDA receptor, the sequence of the 5-HT2B receptor polypeptide ends in a type I consensus target sequence for PDZ domain-containing proteins. This led us to search for a possible role of the C-terminal domain of the 5-HT2B receptor in its coupling to NOS activities. LMTK− fibroblasts were thus stably transfected with a 3′-terminal deleted version of the cDNA encoding the 5-HT2B receptor (LM5 cells). As shown in Fig.5, upon expression of this truncated 5-HT2B receptor, DOI-dependent cNOS and iNOS activations were no longer observed. Although deletion of the C-terminal domain of the 5-HT2B receptor did not impair its functional coupling to PIP2 hydrolysis (Fig.1 B), it completely abolished DOI-dependent cGMP formation (Fig. 1 A). We therefore conclude that, at least in LMTK− fibroblasts, the C-terminal domain of the 5-HT2B receptor participates to the recruitment of both the cNOS and iNOS signaling pathways. We finally examined whether a peptide, the sequence of which overlaps that of the VSYI(D/E) motif at the C terminus of the 5-HT2Breceptor, could interfere with the NOS activities. As shown in Fig. 5, addition to permeabilized cells of a 20-amino acid peptide identical to the C terminus of the receptor prevents stimulation by DOI of cNOS and iNOS activities in all three cell types. Together, these results clearly establish that the C-terminal tail of the 5-HT2Breceptor is critical for functional coupling to cNOS and iNOS. The role of the VSYI(D/E) motif in 5-HT2B receptor-mediated NOSs activation was further tested b"

We have previously reported RYR-mediated elementary (Ca2+ sparks) and global Ca2+ responses in rat portal vein myocytes. Here, we investigated the respective roles of all three RYR subtypes expressed in these cells as revealed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting each one of the three RYR subtypes were shown to specifically inhibit the expression of the corresponding mRNA and protein without affecting the other RYR subtypes. Confocal Ca2+ measurements revealed that depolarization-induced Ca2+ sparks and global Ca2+ responses were blocked when either RYR1 or RYR2 expression was suppressed. Caffeine-induced Ca2+ responses were partly inhibited by the same antisense oligonucleotides. Neither the corresponding scrambled oligonucleotides nor the antisense oligonucleotides targeting RYR3 affected depolarization- or caffeine-induced Ca2+ responses. Our results show that, in vascular myocytes, the two RYR1 and RYR2 subtypes are required for Ca2+ release during Ca2+ sparks and global Ca2+ responses, evoked by activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.

Two families of intracellular Ca2+ release channels are known; the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor family is activated by the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, while the ryanodine receptor (RYR)1 family is activated by cytosolic Ca2+ and is able to bind the plant alkaloid ryanodine (1.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 388-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 2.Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Since the description of a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanism in skeletal muscle (3.Endo M. Tanaka M. Ogawa Y. Nature. 1970; 228: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), the function of RYR as a Ca2+-activated Ca2+release channel has been widely studied in both skeletal and cardiac muscles, where the mechanisms of RYR activation by plasma membrane depolarization are different. In skeletal muscle, RYR is thought to be operated by a mechanical coupling with the dihydropyridine receptor Ca2+ channels without requirement of Ca2+influx (4.Schneider M.F. Chandler W.K. Nature. 1973; 242: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 5.Marks A.R. Tempst P. Hwang K.S. Taubman M.B. Inui M. Chadwick C. Fleischer S. Nadal-Ginard B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, the cardiac type of excitation-contraction coupling involves a depolarization-dependent Ca2+ influx via dihydropyridine receptor Ca2+channels, which triggers Ca2+ release through RYR (7.Fabiato A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 85: 247-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 8.Nabauer M. Callewaert G. Cleemann L. Morad M. Science. 1989; 244: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).

Both RYR and dihydropyridine receptor Ca2+ channel subtypes involved in depolarization-induced Ca2+ release are different between cardiac and skeletal muscle. The skeletal Ca2+ release depends on ryanodine receptor subtype 1 (RYR1) activation (18.Takeshima H. Iino M. Takekura H. Nishi M. Kun J. Minowa O. Takano H. Noda T. Nature. 1994; 369: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Despite a recent report showing that in embryonic cardiac myocytes isolated from mutant mice lacking RYR2, the CICR mechanism is not significantly affected (19.Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Hirose K. Nishi M. Noda T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3309-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the mature cardiac CICR is thought to occur through subtype 2 (RYR2). Since smooth and cardiac muscles share the expression of RYR2 subtype and highly homologous α1C L-type Ca2+ channel subclones (20.Neylon C.B. Richards S.M. Larsen M.A. Agrotis A. Bobik A. Biochem.

However, some studies have shown that both RYR1 and RYR3 may also be activated by Ca2+ influx upon L-type Ca2+ channel activation (18.Takeshima H. Iino M. Takekura H. Nishi M. Kun J. Minowa O. Takano H. Noda T. Nature. 1994; 369: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 25.Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G.

Subtypes of RYR potentially expressed in these cells were first identified by RT-PCR, and then we designed antisense oligonucleotides that specifically targeted each RYR subtype. The efficiency of these antisense oligonucleotides was checked by studying their ability to specifically inhibit RYR subtype expression on one hand and to inhibit Ca2+ sparks or global Ca2+ responses induced by membrane depolarization or caffeine application on the other. We show for the first time that both RYR1 and RYR2 subtypes are required for Ca2+ sparks and global Ca2+ responses induced by activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. These results suggest the existence of mixed functional Ca2+ release channel units composed of RYR1 and RYR2 subtypes in vascular myocytes.DISCUSSIONOur results show that, in rat portal vein myocytes, the three known RYR subtypes are expressed and that both RYR1 and RYR2 subtypes are required for Ca2+ release during Ca2+sparks and global Ca2+ responses induced by activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Up to now, co-expression of the three RYR subtypes has been mainly observed in arterial and venous smooth muscle (Ref. 20.Neylon C.B. Richards S.M. Larsen M.A. Agrotis A. Bobik A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar; present study). Although RYR3 has been shown to be ubiquitously expressed (34.Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), co-expression of both RYR1 and RYR2 has not been reported in other cell types. The most widely studied models of Ca2+ release channels are those of cardiac and skeletal cells expressing RYR subtypes 2 and 3 and RYR subtypes 1 and 3, respectively.To study the role of each subtype of RYRs in vascular smooth muscle, we designed antisense oligonucleotides able to specifically inhibit the expression of each RYR subtype. As previously reported, appropriate controls are needed to demonstrate the efficiency of antisense oligonucleotides in living cells (35.Bennett C.F. Condon T.P. Grimm S. Chan H. Chiang M.Y. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3530-3540PubMed Google Scholar, 36.McGraw K. McKay R. Miraglia L. Boggs R.T. Pribble J.P. Muller M. Geiger T. Fabbro D. Dean N.M. Anticancer Drug Des. 1997; 12: 315-326PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, this is demonstrated by evaluating the ability of antisense oligonucleotides to reduce the expression of the targeted mRNA by PCR and of the protein by BODIPY®-labeled ryanodine staining of the cells. In addition, the use of antisense oligonucleotides requires checking the specificity of their effects. This latter point has been investigated in several aspects, by showing the following: (i) the specific inhibition of the targeted mRNA by one given antisense oligonucleotide and the lack of effect of the same antisense on the other mRNAs; (ii) the reproducibility of the effect of one antisense oligonucleotide by another antisense sequence targeting the same mRNA; (iii) the lack of effect of scrambled control oligonucleotides; and (iv) the reduction of RYR staining produced by each antisense oligonucleotide compared with the suppression of staining after injection of a mixture of oligonucleotides targeting the three RYR subtypes.Using this antisense strategy, we show, for the first time, that both RYR1 and RYR2 subtypes of ryanodine receptors are required for an efficient CICR in venous myocytes. This point is the main finding of our study and is supported by the fact that in asRYR1- or in asRYR2-injected cells, no CICR could be observed in response to activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. This inhibition of CICR mechanism is not due to a side-effect of antisense injection on Ca2+ channels, since neither the Ca2+ current densities nor the gating properties of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are affected when compared with noninjected cells. A cross-inhibition of RYR2 mRNA expression by asRYR1 orvice versa can be discarded, since we show that mRNA expression is inhibited only by the corresponding asRYR and not by the others. Moreover, the effects of asRYR1 and asRYR2 are additive in inhibiting the caffeine-induced Ca2+ responses, suggesting that different mRNAs are targeted by these antisense oligonucleotides. Since all three RYR subtypes appear to be similarly expressed in portal vein myocytes, the effect of asRYR1 or asRYR2 cannot be related to a dramatic decrease of the total RYR protein. For control, we report that in the same cell batches, asRYR3 decreases the BODIPY®-ryanodine staining by the same extent as asRYR1 or asRYR2 without affecting the Ca2+ signals.Requirement of both subtypes RYR1 and RYR2 is observed for activation of Ca2+ sparks as well as global Ca2+responses, suggesting that even the elementary Ca2+ events result from the activation of mixed Ca2+ release units, composed of two different channel-forming proteins. Although never demonstrated, it was generally believed that the smooth muscle CICR was mediated by RYR2, and it was referred as a cardiac-type CICR. We confirm that, in short term cultured vascular myocytes, the coupling between voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and RYRs requires a Ca2+ influx, but we show that the Ca2+ release depends on activation of both RYR1 and RYR2. Accordingly, previous data have reported that skeletal (RYR1) and cardiac (RYR2) ryanodine receptors can be activated by Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels without needing the specific skeletal voltage-sensor coupling (25.Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Transient knockout of RYR subtypes by antisense oligonucleotides reveals that the cellular distribution of RYRs strongly modulates the Ca2+ responses. As long as one of the two RYR1 or RYR2 subtypes is expressed, caffeine produces Ca2+ responses of reduced amplitude, whereas membrane depolarizations are ineffective in triggering any Ca2+ response on the same cells. These results indicate that caffeine may activate isolated RYRs everywhere in the scanned line. In contrast, when the cells are stimulated by membrane depolarization or BayK 8644, the Ca2+ influx triggering Ca2+ sparks is certainly limited to some particular cytoplasmic areas that are in close association with sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane sites possessing RYR1/RYR2 mixed clusters. Consequently, when one RYR subtype is missing, the reduction in the density of RYR channels within the cluster may be large enough to inhibit the Ca2+ release unit, whereas caffeine may always activate the remaining RYRs. This proposal is in agreement with immunodetection of RYRs in the confocal sections of portal vein myocytes, showing that RYRs are distributed homogeneously in the sarcoplasmic reticulum with some spots of RYRs in areas corresponding to the cell periphery and to infoldings of the plasma membrane (37.Boittin F-X. Macrez N. Halet G. Mironneau J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C139-C151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the RYR1 proteins co-localize with the RYR2 proteins to form functional Ca2+release units. We propose different hypotheses concerning the respective roles of RYR1 and RYR2 within these Ca2+ release units. A first possibility would be that the clusters are composed of RYR1 and RYR2 homotetramers, which can similarly be activated by Ca2+. In agreement with the concept that functional RYRs exist as homotetramers (38.Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we report here existing, although decreased, global Ca2+ responses to caffeine when either RYR1 or RYR2 expression has been suppressed. A second possibility would be that RYR1 may be responsible for addressing of RYR2 clusters to the proper plasma membrane sites, since RYR1 has been shown to be tightly bridged to the plasma membrane through an associated protein network in skeletal myocytes (39.Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). A third possibility would be that the Ca2+ release unit is reduced to a single Ca2+release channel able to generate a Ca2+ spark. Under these conditions, in venous myocytes, this channel might be a heterotetramer made from RYR1 and RYR2 proteins. Although inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors have been suggested to be organized as homo- or heterotetramers (40.Joseph S.K. Lin C. Pierson S. Thomas A.P. Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 41.Wojcikiewicz R.J. He Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), only homotetramers have been reported for RYRs (38.Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As cellular approaches cannot help to resolve the exact composition of Ca2+ release units generating Ca2+ sparks, reconstitution experiments are needed to elucidate the contribution of each RYR subtype to CICR in vascular myocytes.Despite a clear inhibition of RYR3 mRNA and protein expression by asRYR3, these antisense oligonucleotides are ineffective in inhibiting Ca2+ signals. The lack of effect of asRYR3 on membrane depolarization- and caffeine-induced Ca2+responses together with the complete inhibition of both responses by asRYR1+2 suggests that RYR3 is not activated by either Ca2+or caffeine in 1.7 mm Ca2+-containing solution. Similarly, knockout mice lacking RYR3 retain the normal excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle (42.Takeshima H. Ikemoto T. Nishi M. Nishiyama N. Shimuta M. Sugitani Y. Kuno J. Saito I. Saito H. Endo M. Iino M. Noda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19649-19652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), although a reduced contractile response was observed (43.Bertocchinni F. Ovitt C.E. Conti A. Barone V. Scholer H.R. Bottinelli R. Reggiani C. Sorrentino V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6956-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A recent study has reported that in adult mice myotubes, Ca2+ sparks arise from RYR1, whereas in embryonic muscle, RYR3 contributes together with RYR1 to the generation of larger Ca2+ sparks (44.Conklin M.W. Barone V. Sorrentino V. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1394-13403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, RYR3 has been shown to be activated by a higher concentration of caffeine or in high Ca2+-containing solution (45.Takeshima H. Yamazawa T. Ikemoto T. Takekura H. Nishi M. Noda T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,46.Sonnleitner A. Conti A. Bertocchini F. Schindler H. Sorrentino V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2790-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) 2F. Coussin, N. Macrez, and J. Mironneau, unpublished data. and under more physiological conditions when cADPR is produced in T lymphocytes (47.Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Berg I. Skapenko A.L. Weber K. Heyer P. Hohenegger M. Ashamu G.A. Schulze-Koops H. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Nature. 1999; 398: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, we do not exclude a role for RYR3 in smooth muscle, but the basic stimulation of these cells by membrane depolarization or caffeine, in normal external Ca2+ concentration, does not involve the subtype 3 of RYR.In conclusion, our results show that the co-expression of RYR1 and RYR2 in vascular myocytes is of physiological and functional relevance, since both RYR subtypes are absolutely required for effective Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. This combination of Ca2+ release channels suggests that dysfunctions or mutations of RYR1 and RYR2 subtypes might affect vascular smooth muscle. Ca2+ signaling is a common step for activation of all muscle cell types and Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum plays an essential role in the regulation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Two families of intracellular Ca2+ release channels are known; the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor family is activated by the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, while the ryanodine receptor (RYR)1 family is activated by cytosolic Ca2+ and is able to bind the plant alkaloid ryanodine (1.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 388-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 2.Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Since the description of a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanism in skeletal muscle (3.Endo M. Tanaka M. Ogawa Y. Nature. 1970; 228: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), the function of RYR as a Ca2+-activated Ca2+release channel has been widely studied in both skeletal and cardiac muscles, where the mechanisms of RYR activation by plasma membrane depolarization are different. In skeletal muscle, RYR is thought to be operated by a mechanical coupling with the dihydropyridine receptor Ca2+ channels without requirement of Ca2+influx (4.Schneider M.F. Chandler W.K. Nature. 1973; 242: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 5.Marks A.R. Tempst P. Hwang K.S. Taubman M.B. Inui M. Chadwick C. Fleischer S. Nadal-Ginard B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, the cardiac type of excitation-contraction coupling involves a depolarization-dependent Ca2+ influx via dihydropyridine receptor Ca2+channels, which triggers Ca2+ release through RYR (7.Fabiato A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 85: 247-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 8.Nabauer M. Callewaert G. Cleemann L. Morad M. Science. 1989; 244: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In smooth muscle, depolarization-induced Ca2+ release via RYR has been described and requires Ca2+ influx (9.Ganitkevich V.Y. Isenberg G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484: 287-306Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10.Kamishima T. McCarron J.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501: 497-508Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Localized Ca2+ release events, called Ca2+sparks, have been shown to be produced by RYRs in smooth muscle as well as in other muscles (11.Cheng H. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B.

As long as one of the two RYR1 or RYR2 subtypes is expressed, caffeine produces Ca2+ responses of reduced amplitude, whereas membrane depolarizations are ineffective in triggering any Ca2+ response on the same cells. These results indicate that caffeine may activate isolated RYRs everywhere in the scanned line. In contrast, when the cells are stimulated by membrane depolarization or BayK 8644, the Ca2+ influx triggering Ca2+ sparks is certainly limited to some particular cytoplasmic areas that are in close association with sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane sites possessing RYR1/RYR2 mixed clusters. Consequently, when one RYR subtype is missing, the reduction in the density of RYR channels within the cluster may be large enough to inhibit the Ca2+ release unit, whereas caffeine may always activate the remaining RYRs. This proposal is in agreement with immunodetection of RYRs in the confocal sections of portal vein myocytes, showing that RYRs are distributed homogeneously in the sarcoplasmic reticulum with some spots of RYRs in areas corresponding to the cell periphery and to infoldings of the plasma membrane (37.Boittin F-X. Macrez N. Halet G. Mironneau J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C139-C151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the RYR1 proteins co-localize with the RYR2 proteins to form functional Ca2+release units. We propose different hypotheses concerning the respective roles of RYR1 and RYR2 within these Ca2+ release units. A first possibility would be that the clusters are composed of RYR1 and RYR2 homotetramers, which can similarly be activated by Ca2+. In agreement with the concept that functional RYRs exist as homotetramers (38.Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we report here existing, although decreased, global Ca2+ responses to caffeine when either RYR1 or RYR2 expression has been suppressed. A second possibility would be that RYR1 may be responsible for addressing of RYR2 clusters to the proper plasma membrane sites, since RYR1 has been shown to be tightly bridged to the plasma membrane through an associated protein network in skeletal myocytes (39.Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). A third possibility would be that the Ca2+ release unit is reduced to a single Ca2+release channel able to generate a Ca2+ spark. Under these conditions, in venous myocytes, this channel might be a heterotetramer made from RYR1 and RYR2 proteins. Although inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors have been suggested to be organized as homo- or heterotetramers (40.Joseph S.K. Lin C. Pierson S. Thomas A.P. Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 41.Wojcikiewicz R.J. He Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), only homotetramers have been reported for RYRs (38.Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As cellular approaches cannot help to resolve the exact composition of Ca2+ release units generating Ca2+ sparks, reconstitution experiments are needed to elucidate the contribution of each RYR subtype to CICR in vascular myocytes.Despite a clear inhibition of RYR3 mRNA and protein expression by asRYR3, these antisense oligonucleotides are ineffective in inhibiting Ca2+ signals. The lack of effect of asRYR3 on membrane depolarization- and caffeine-induced Ca2+responses together with the complete inhibition of both responses by asRYR1+2 suggests that RYR3 is not activated by either Ca2+or caffeine in 1.7 mm Ca2+-containing solution. Similarly, knockout mice lacking RYR3 retain the normal excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle (42.Takeshima H. Ikemoto T. Nishi M. Nishiyama N. Shimuta M. Sugitani Y. Kuno J. Saito I. Saito H. Endo M. Iino M. Noda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19649-19652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), although a reduced contractile response was observed (43.Bertocchinni F. Ovitt C.E. Conti A. Barone V. Scholer H.R. Bottinelli R. Reggiani C. Sorrentino V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6956-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A recent study has reported that in adult mice myotubes, Ca2+ sparks arise from RYR1, whereas in embryonic muscle, RYR3 contributes together with RYR1 to the generation of larger Ca2+ sparks (44.Conklin M.W. Barone V. Sorrentino V. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1394-13403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, RYR3 has been shown to be activated by a higher concentration of caffeine or in high Ca2+-containing solution (45.Takeshima H. Yamazawa T. Ikemoto T. Takekura H. Nishi M. Noda T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,46.Sonnleitner A. Conti A. Bertocchini F. Schindler H. Sorrentino V.

Mironneau, unpublished data. and under more physiological conditions when cADPR is produced in T lymphocytes (47.Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Berg I. Skapenko A.L. Weber K. Heyer P. Hohenegger M. Ashamu G.A. Schulze-Koops H. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Nature. 1999; 398: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, we do not exclude a role for RYR3 in smooth muscle, but the basic stimulation of these cells by membrane depolarization or caffeine, in normal external Ca2+ concentration, does not involve the subtype 3 of RYR.In conclusion, our results show that the co-expression of RYR1 and RYR2 in vascular myocytes is of physiological and functional relevance, since both RYR subtypes are absolutely required for effective Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. This combination of Ca2+ release channels suggests that dysfunctions or mutations of RYR1 and RYR2 subtypes might affect vascular smooth muscle. Our results show that, in rat portal vein myocytes, the three known RYR subtypes are expressed and that both RYR1 and RYR2 subtypes are required for Ca2+ release during Ca2+sparks and global Ca2+ responses induced by activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Up to now, co-expression of the three RYR subtypes has been mainly observed in arterial and venous smooth muscle (Ref. 20.Neylon C.B. Richards S.M. Larsen M.A. Agrotis A. Bobik A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar; present study). Although RYR3 has been shown to be ubiquitously expressed (34.Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), co-expression of both RYR1 and RYR2 has not been reported in other cell types. The most widely studied models of Ca2+ release channels are those of cardiac and skeletal cells expressing RYR subtypes 2 and 3 and RYR subtypes 1 and 3, respectively. To study the role of each subtype of RYRs in vascular smooth muscle, we designed antisense oligonucleotides able to specifically inhibit the expression of each RYR subtype. As previously reported, appropriate controls are needed to demonstrate the efficiency of antisense oligonucleotides in living cells (35.Bennett C.F. Condon T.P. Grimm S. Chan H. Chiang M.Y. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3530-3540PubMed Google Scholar, 36.McGraw K. McKay R. Miraglia L. Boggs R.T. Pribble J.P. Muller M. Geiger T. Fabbro D. Dean N.M. Anticancer Drug Des. 1997; 12: 315-326PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, this is demonstrated by evaluating the ability of antisense oligonucleotides to reduce the expression of the targeted mRNA by PCR and of the protein by BODIPY®-labeled ryanodine staining of the cells. In addition, the use of antisense oligonucleotides requires checking the specificity of their effects. This latter point has been investigated in several aspects, by showing the following: (i) the specific inhibition of the targeted mRNA by one given antisense oligonucleotide and the lack of effect of the same antisense on the other mRNAs; (ii) the reproducibility of the effect of one antisense oligonucleotide by another antisense sequence targeting the same mRNA; (iii) the lack of effect of scrambled control oligonucleotides; and (iv) the reduction of RYR staining produced by each antisense oligonucleotide compared with the suppression of staining after injection of a mixture of oligonucleotides targeting the three RYR subtypes. Using this antisense strategy, we show, for the first time, that both RYR1 and RYR2 subtypes of ryanodine receptors are required for an efficient CICR in venous myocytes. This point is the main finding of our study and is supported by the fact that in asRYR1- or in asRYR2-injected cells, no CICR could be observed in response to activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. This inhibition of CICR mechanism is not due to a side-effect of antisense injection on Ca2+ channels, since neither the Ca2+ current densities nor the gating properties of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are affected when compared with noninjected cells. A cross-inhibition of RYR2 mRNA expression by asRYR1 orvice versa can be discarded, since we show that mRNA expression is inhibited only by the corresponding asRYR and not by the others. Moreover, the effects of asRYR1 and asRYR2 are additive in inhibiting the caffeine-induced Ca2+ responses, suggesting that different mRNAs are targeted by these antisense oligonucleotides. Since all three RYR subtypes appear to be similarly expressed in portal vein myocytes, the effect of asRYR1 or asRYR2 cannot be related to a dramatic decrease of the total RYR protein. For control, we report that in the same cell batches, asRYR3 decreases the BODIPY®-ryanodine staining by the same extent as asRYR1 or asRYR2 without affecting the Ca2+ signals. Requirement of both subtypes RYR1 and RYR2 is observed for activation of Ca2+ sparks as well as global Ca2+responses, suggesting that even the elementary Ca2+ events result from the activation of mixed Ca2+ release units, composed of two different channel-forming proteins. Although never demonstrated, it was generally believed that the smooth muscle CICR was mediated by RYR2, and it was referred as a cardiac-type CICR. We confirm that, in short term cultured vascular myocytes, the coupling between voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and RYRs requires a Ca2+ influx, but we show that the Ca2+ release depends on activation of both RYR1 and RYR2. Accordingly, previous data have reported that skeletal (RYR1) and cardiac (RYR2) ryanodine receptors can be activated by Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels without needing the specific skeletal voltage-sensor coupling (25.Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Transient knockout of RYR subtypes by antisense oligonucleotides reveals that the cellular distribution of RYRs strongly modulates the Ca2+ responses. As long as one of the two RYR1 or RYR2 subtypes is expressed, caffeine produces Ca2+ responses of reduced amplitude, whereas membrane depolarizations are ineffective in triggering any Ca2+ response on the same cells.

Ligand binding specificity for some molecules, including many growth factors, is determined by complex heparan sulfate fine structure, where highly sulfated, iduronate-rich domains alternate with N-acetylated domains. Syndecan-4, a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, has a distinct role in cell adhesion, suggesting its chains may differ from those of other cell surface proteoglycans. To determine whether the specific role of syndecan-4 correlates with a distinct heparan sulfate structure, we have analyzed heparan sulfate chains from the different surface proteoglycans of a single fibroblast strain and compared their ability to bind the Hep II domain of fibronectin, a ligand known to promote focal adhesion formation through syndecan-4. Despite distinct molecular masses of glypican and syndecan glycosaminoglycans and minor differences in disaccharide composition and sulfation pattern, the overall proportion and distribution of sulfated regions and the affinity for the Hep II domain were similar.

Syndecans 1–4 are integral membrane proteoglycans with highly conserved transmembrane domains and two constant regions in the cytoplasmic domain, whereas glypicans, which are tethered to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, lack the cytoplasmic connection.

At present, the overall sulfation pattern is thought to be determined by the cell type or physiological state rather than the core protein, although it has not been clearly established whether different proteoglycans from the same cell can carry HS chains with distinct structure and functions. Cell adhesion is one of the processes requiring the presence of proteoglycans on the cell surface (1.Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 2.Couchman J.R.

Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Ge Y. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3433-3441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In REFs, HS chains are present on multiple cell surface proteoglycans, but only syndecan-4 is localized in focal adhesion contacts, without apparent interference from other HSPG species. To explore the possibility that syndecan-4 HS chains have specific structural features that would support the unique ability of syndecan-4 to interact with extracellular matrix ligands in focal adhesion contacts, we examined whether REFs produce proteoglycans with distinct heparan sulfate chains based on the protein core. We isolated separate populations of radioactively labeled GPI-anchored proteoglycans (glypican-1) and integral membrane proteoglycans (syndecan-1, -2 and -4). In addition, syndecan-4 was immunoprecipitated from REFs using a specific monoclonal antibody. The size of their respective HS chains was compared by gel filtration HPLC. Fine structure of the chains was examined by enzymatic and chemical treatment, and their ligand binding ability was determined by affinity coelectrophoresis. Rat embryo fibroblasts were cultured as described previously (28.Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell monolayers with or without prior PI-PLC treatment were washed and scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, then transferred into 0.1 m sodium chloride,1 mm calcium chloride, 0.05 m HEPES-acetate, pH 7.0. Samples (50 μl of cell suspension from a 1× 75cm2flask) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 2.5 milliunits of heparinase III (heparitinase I, EC 4.2.2.8, Seikagaku America, Falmouth, MA) to remove HS chains. Phospholipase treatment resulted in cell fragility, so protease inhibitors 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmbenzamidine hydrochloride were retained during the harvest and heparinase III incubation. The presence or absence of protease inhibitors resulted in no major differences in samples not exposed to PI-PLC. Samples corresponding to equal cell amounts were electrophoresed on a 3–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Core proteins of HSPGs were detected by Western blotting using 3G10 monoclonal antibody (Seikagaku America), which specifically recognizes an epitope created by the heparinase III treatment, including a terminal unsaturated uronic acid residue (29.David G. Bai X.M. Van Der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van Den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Nearly confluent REFs were labeled overnight with 50 μCi/ml [35S]H2SO4 (NEN Life Science Products) or [3H]glucosamine (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) in the absence of serum. Cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h with serum-free medium containing 0.1 milliunits of PI-PLC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at 37 °C to release GPI-linked proteoglycans (30.Schmidtchen A. Sundler R. Fransson L.-A. Glycoconj. J. 1990; 7: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed with Tris-buffered saline, 0.5 mm EDTA, and remaining cell surface proteoglycans were cleaved by a 10-min incubation with 70 μg/ml chymotrypsin (Sigma) at 4 °C (31.Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4103-4109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GPI-linked and integral radioactively labeled proteoglycans were purified by anion exchange chromatography and precipitated with 80% (v/v) ethanol after the addition of 0.2 mg/ml chondroitin sulfate carrier (32.Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). REFs were labeled at seeding (1:2 split) with 10 mCi of [35S]H2SO4in 10 ml of basal medium Eagle (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) containing 20 μm Na2SO4 as a carrier or with 4 mCi of [3H]glucosamine in α-minimum Eagle's medium with 5% dialyzed serum. Cells were allowed to attach and spread overnight. The next day, monolayers were washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmleupeptin, 1.0% Triton, and incubated for 60 min on ice. Syndecan-4 was immunoprecipitated from the lysate as described previously (33.Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar,34.Woods A. Longley R.L. Tumova S. Couchman J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, precleared lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal anti-syndecan-4 antibody 150.9 and then sequentially with rabbit anti-mouse IgG and protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h each. After washing the beads extensively with the lysis buffer, syndecan-4 was eluted by boiling in 4 m guanidinium hydrochloride buffer. The lysate was subjected to several rounds of immunoprecipitation to maximize the yield. Free glycosaminoglycan chains were obtained by alkaline elimination and purified as described previously (32.Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, proteoglycan samples were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 0.5 m NaOH, 1 mNaBH4, which destroys the core proteins. After neutralization with 10 m acetic acid, the glycosaminoglycans were reprecipitated with ethanol, dried, and incubated with chondroitin-ABC lyase (Seikagaku America) for 16 h at 37 °C to degrade chondroitin sulfate. Heparan sulfate chains were separated from chondroitin sulfate disaccharides by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), desalted on a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.), and lyophilized. The size of [35S]HS chains was examined by gel filtration chromatography on TSK 4000 (35.Tumova S. Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9078-9085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The TSK 4000 HPLC column (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA) was equilibrated and run in 0.1 m KH2PO4 buffer, pH 6.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2% Zwittergent at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/minute. Fractions of 0.5 ml were assayed for radioactivity. Similar results were obtained when the column was equilibrated in 4m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 6.0, to prevent self-association of glycosaminoglycans. A Superdex peptide fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for separation of short oligosaccharides (36.Spillmann D. Witt D. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15487-15493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It was equilibrated in 0.5 m pyridine acetate, pH 5.0, and HS chains were eluted from the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated with oligosaccharides generated by low pH nitrous acid treatment from [3H]glucosamine-labeled glycos- aminoglycans. [3H]HS chains were mixed with unlabeled heparin or HS (0.02 mg/ml final) and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with 1.2 milliunits of heparinase I (heparinase EC 4.2.2.7, Seikagaku America) or heparinase III. The reaction buffer was 1 mm calcium acetate, 40 mmsodium acetate, pH 7.0, for heparinase I or 0.1 mm calcium acetate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 0.1% Tween for heparinase III. To ensure the reaction went to completion, another 1.2-milliunit aliquot of the enzyme was added after 6 h, and the mixture was incubated overnight. Heparinase I degradation products were analyzed by gel filtration on a TSK 4000 column, whereas the sizes of heparinase III degradation products were examined on a Superdex peptide column. [3H]HS chains were incubated with low pH nitrous acid as described by Shively and Conrad (37.Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). This treatment specifically cleaves the glycosaminoglycan atN-sulfated glucosamine residues. The degradation products were resolved by gel filtration on a Superdex column. [35S]HS chains were digested by three additions of 1.25 milliunits of heparinase I and heparinase III over the period of 36 h in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.1 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0, containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.1 mg/ml heparin. This treatment degraded all HS chains mostly to disaccharides (60–90%), which were then isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex column, lyophilized, and separated by SAX chromatography. Samples were applied to a SAX Partisil column (0.5 × 25 mm, Whatman, Clifton, NJ) equilibrated in 28 mmKH2PO4, and eluted by a step gradient with increasing concentrations of KH2PO4 (38.Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and assayed for radioactivity. The identity of [35S]disaccharides was determined by comparison with heparin disaccharide standards (Sigma). The affinity of the interaction between free HS chains and their ligands was determined by affinity coelectrophoresis (39.Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2678-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Labeled HS samples were applied into horizontal slots in a 1% agarose gel (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) and electrophoresed through precast 15-mm lanes containing different concentrations of the recombinant Hep II domain of fibronectin (isolated by affinity chromatography on nickel-agarose and heparin-Sepharose as described previously (34.Woods A. Longley R.L. Tumova S. Couchman J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar)). The gels were prepared as indicated by Lee and Lander (39.Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2678-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using 1% agarose in 50 mm MOPSO, 125 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, and 0.5% CHAPS. Electrophoresis was performed for 120 min at 50 V (constant voltage) using 50 mm MOPSO, 125 mmsodium acetate, pH 7.0, as a running buffer. Gels were dried under vacuum and subjected to autoradiography. Retardation coefficient R derived from relative mobilities of [35S]HS in the presence and absence of the ligand was used to calculate dissociation constants (39.Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2678-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Glypican-1 and syndecans-1, -2, and -4 were previously reported as major HSPGs in skin and lung fibroblasts (40.Lories V. Cassiman J.-J. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1116-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Schofield K.P. Gallagher J.T. David G. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 663-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the identity of HSPGs on the REF cell surface, lysate from cells treated with heparinase III was subjected to gel electrophoresis, and HSPG core proteins were detected by Western blotting (Fig.1). Monoclonal antibody recognizing sugar residues left after the heparitinase digestion of PI-PLC-treated cells (lane 1) revealed specific polypeptides at 44, 48, 65, and ∼90 kDa. The lower molecular weight polypeptides correspond to syndecan-4 (44,000) and syndecan-2 (48,000) (Ref. 18.Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar and data not shown). The polypeptide of 90 kDa is probably syndecan-1 (40.Lories V. Cassiman J.-J. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1116-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polypeptide of 65 kDa was the major detected product in cells not treated with PI-PLC before harvesting (lane 2), resulting in little signal from the syndecans unless the blot was overexposed (not shown). The 65-kDa polypeptide was greatly reduced after PI-PLC treatment (lane 1), indicating that the protein was linked to the cell surface with a GPI anchor, thus confirming the proteoglycan identity as glypican. To obtain separate pools of GPI-linked and integral proteoglycans, radioactively labeled cells were first treated with PI-PLC to obtain glypican (30.Schmidtchen A. Sundler R. Fransson L.-A. Glycoconj. J. 1990; 7: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and then the ectodomains of remaining cell surface [35S]HSPGs were released by chymotrypsin digestion. Under the conditions used in the labeling, at least 50% of cell surface [35S]HS chains originated from glypican. Based on the proteoglycan identification in the Fig. 1, the pool derived from integral proteoglycans contains mostly syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 as well as syndecan-1 and will be henceforth referred to as the syndecan population. In addition, immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody 150.9 was used to specifically isolate radioactively labeled syndecan-4 proteoglycan. Sizes of [35S]HS chains from glypican and syndecan populations obtained by enzymatic treatment as well as HS chains from immunoprecipitated syndecan-4 were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a TSK 4000 HPLC column (Fig. 2). Reproducible differences were observed between HS chains of different origin. Glypican-derived glycosaminoglycans (K av ∼ 0.57) were shorter than HS from both the total syndecan population (K av ∼ 0.43) and syndecan-4 (K av ∼ 0.41) (TableI), indicating that HS chains of specific length can be attached to different core proteins in REFs. This may not be entirely unexpected, as matrix HSPGs were shown previously to contain longer HS chains than those of the cell surface HSPG population (42.Schmidtchen A. Fransson L.-A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting the cellular synthetic machinery is able to distinguish between different core proteins. Glypican HS chains in our study were slightly bigger than the largest standard, indicating the mass was close to 60 kDa, whereas the syndecan glycosaminoglycans far exceeded the calibration standards, making it impossible to accurately determine their molecular mass. Despite their different sizes, glypican and syndecan HS chains displayed comparable net charge, since similar salt concentrations (0.63 and 0.66 m NaCl, respectively) were required to elute them from a 1-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel (TableI).Table IStructural characteristics for HS derived from different proteoglycans in REFsSyndecansSyndecan-4GlypicanSize of intact HS (K av on TSK 4000)0.43 ± 0.010.41 ± 0.030.57 ± 0.01Size of heparinase III-resistant fragments (K av on TSK 4000)0.62 ± 0.040.71 ± 0.02aTwo independent experiments were performed to determine the value.0.65 ± 0.03Elution from DEAE-Sephacel0.67 mNaClaTwo independent experiments were performed to determine the value.ND0.63 m NaClaTwo independent experiments were performed to determine the value.Nitrous acid susceptibility28.0 ± 1.327.9 ± 0.531.5 ± 1.3 Contiguous N-sulfationbExpressed as percentage of N-sulfated disaccharides.21.2 ± 1.323.8 ± 0.732.4 ± 1.1 AlternatingN-sulfationbExpressed as percentage of N-sulfated disaccharides.33.9 ± 1.430.5 ± 1.129.6 ± 0.8 SpacedN-sulfationbExpressed as percentage of N-sulfated disaccharides.45.0 ± 1.545.7 ± 0.638.0 ± 1.4Affinity for Hep II:K d (nm)66 ± 163 ± 10aTwo independent experiments were performed to determine the value.67 ± 1The values were determined as an average from three independent experiments, except where indicated otherwise.

Heparan sulfate chains have a characteristic structural organization, which is critical for ligand binding abilities (7.Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 8.Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol.

Heparan sulfate polymers consist of continuously N-sulfated S-domains rich in 2-O-sulfated iduronate interspersed withN-acetylated domains containing predominantly glucuronate residues and low sulfate levels. Mixed sequences with alternatingN-sulfated and N-acetylated glucosamine are found at the borders. To examine the sulfation pattern and distribution of S-domains, radioactively labeled HS chains were subjected to chemical and enzymatic digestion with defined specificity, and the resulting oligosaccharides were analyzed by gel filtration (Fig.3). Since using the [35S]H2SO4 label can obscure the results for shorter oligosaccharides that may lack sulfated residues, fine structure analysis was performed using HS labeled with [3H]glucosamine, which incorporates uniformly along the chain. Low pH nitrous acid treatment cleaves HS specifically atN-sulfated glucosamine, and thus, sizes of generated fragments indicate the length of sequences separatingN-sulfated residues. Consequently, nitrous acid-generated disaccharides correspond to contiguous N-sulfated sequences, tetrasaccharides indicate mixedN-sulfated/N-acetylated sequences, and longer oligosaccharides originate from sequences with a low level ofN-sulfation. Therefore, by comparing the oligosaccharide composition of nitrous acid digests from different HS species, one can analyze the differences in the distribution of N-sulfated domains. Nitrous acid treatment produced comparable profiles for glypican, total syndecan, and syndecan-4-derived HS chains (Fig.3 A). Overall the level of N-sulfation was similar for all chains (approximately 30%, Table I), which is lower than that previously reported for skin fibroblast HS (40–50%) (42.Schmidtchen A. Fransson L.-A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, a reproducible difference was observed in the level of contiguousN-sulfation. In glypican HS chains, approximately 32%N-sulfated disaccharides were present in contiguous sequences, whereas in total syndecan and syndecan-4 HS populations contiguous sequences accounted for only 21 and 23%N-sulfation, respectively (Table I). This suggests that the distribution, rather than level, of N-sulfation may be slightly different between the HSPGs. Heparinase I and III are bacterial enzymes that cleave HS with defined specificity. Heparinase III acts on low sulfated,N-acetylated regions, cleaving predominantly the sequence GlcNAc-glucuronic acid, but it can also tolerate N-sulfation and 6-O-sulfation of the glucosamine residue, so it degrades the major part of a typical HS chain to disaccharides, whereas it leaves S-domains intact (43.Sugahara K. Tohno-oka R. Yamada S. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 44.Linhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, analysis of the degradation products can be used to estimate the size of S-domains. When heparinase III-generated oligosaccharides from all three HS species were resolved on a Superdex column, the profiles were nearly identical. More than 50% of the material was degraded to disaccharides, whereas a small amount of tetrasaccharides and 10–12 residue oligosaccharides remained uncleaved, representing the resistant sequences within S-domains (Fig. 3 B).

The AR is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily that is composed of a variable amino-terminal domain, a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a ligand-binding domain (2.Chang C.

In contrast to coactivators, corepressors (such as NCoR-1 and SMRT) bind to the nuclear receptors in the absence of ligands, recruit histone deacetyltransferase, and lead to condensation of nucleosomal structures for repression of transcription (23.Heinzel T.

The amino-terminal domain of steroid receptors contains a ligand-independent activation function-1 (AF-1), which is under the control of activation function-2. The amino-terminal domain of steroid receptors has been reported to interact with general transcription factors, as exemplified by AR interaction with transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) (25.McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), thyroid receptor interaction with transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) (26.Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Wu S. Koudinova N. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1535-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which AF-1 synergistically activates transcription remains unclear. Steroid receptors are phosphoproteins and their activities can be modulated by phosphorylation (28.Weigel N.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that cross-talk between the receptor signaling pathways and the phosphorylation signal transduction pathways may lead to the hormone refractory tumor growth. The estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor mediate gene transcription in response to insulin growth factor-1, epidermal growth factor, protein kinase A, and dopamine in the absence of ligand (29.O'Malley B.W.

Trans. 1997; 25: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The activity of ER AF-1 has been shown to be dependent on phosphorylation of a highly conserved serine residue, Ser-118 (31.Le Goff P. Montano M.M. Schodin D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AR can also be activated by insulin growth factor-1, epidermal growth factor, protein kinase A, and mitogen-activated protein kinase in the absence of androgen (32.Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Trapman J. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5472-5478Google Scholar, 33.Nazareth L.V. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19900-19907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In addition to these signaling pathways, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylates Ser-Pro motifs of the AR (34.Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.-Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5458-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), suggesting that steroid receptors can be phosphorylated through different pathways. Recent studies showed that the CAK induces phosphorylation of the amino-terminal domain of ER, glucocorticoid receptor, and retinoic acid receptor and enhances their activity (35.Krstic M.D. Rogatsky I.

In an effort to analyze AR-mediated transactivation, we performed co-immunoprecipitation of LNCaP nuclear extracts using anti-AR antibody, followed by Western blot with antibodies against various general transcription factors. We found that the AR interacted with TFIIH in a physiological condition and that overexpression of CAK, the kinase moiety of TFIIH, enhanced AR-mediated transactivation in prostate cancer cells. We also demonstrated that the AR NH2-terminal domain interacts with CAK and is required for CAK-induced AR transactivation. The complementary DNA fragments for cdk7, cyclin H, MAT1, and GAL4-SP1 were generated by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pSG5 (Stratagene). The plasmid encoding GAL4-DBD fused with the AR NH2-terminal domain (GAL4-ARN) was constructed by ligation of pSG5GAL4-DBD (1–147) and a DNA fragment encoding the AR NH2-terminal domain amino acids from 38 to 561. DU145 cells, PC-3 cells, and LNCaP cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12K supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum, and RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. All media contained 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded to be a density of 50–60% confluency for transfection. Cells in 35-mm dishes were refed with fresh medium 2 h before transfection and transfected with 2 μg of DNA according to the “SuperFect Transfection” instruction (Qiagen). After 2–3 h incubation, cells were treated with medium supplemented with charcoal-depleted fetal bovine serum containing either ethanol or ligands. Cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested. Cell lysates were prepared and used for luciferase assay according to the manufacture's instruction (Promega). Relative luciferase activities were plotted using the activity of AR in the absence of ligand and coactivator as 1. The results were obtained from at least three sets of transfection and presented as mean ± S.D. LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. LNCaP nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (38.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) and aliquots stored at −70 °C. For immunoprecipitation, protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) resins were incubated with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) overnight, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and coupled to anti-human AR polyclonal antibody (NH27) as follows. Swollen protein A-Sepharose (100 μl) was incubated with 500 μl of crude immune serum raised against AR. IgG was incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by two washes with 0.2 m sodium borate. Diaminodipropylamine from ICN was added to a final concentration of 100 mm and resins were incubated for 1 h. Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 m in order to block any unreacted diaminodipropylamine. Protein A-Sepharose resins conjugated with anti-AR antibody were washed with 0.1 mpotassium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 0.4 m KCl and stored at 4 °C. The conjugated resins (30 μl bed volume) were incubated with 3 mg of LNCaP nuclear extract for 4 h at 4 °C, then extensively washed with 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 100 mm KCl. The resins were incubated with 0.2 mglycine-HCl (pH 2.5) and then were extensively washed with 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) and incubated with 0.2m ethanolamine (pH 11.5) to elute proteins. The eluted proteins were combined and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blotting was performed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Affinity purified anti-cdk7 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-p62, anti-human TATA-binding protein, anti-Rap74, anti-Rap30, and anti-TFIIB antisera were generous gifts from Robert G. Roeder. In order to identify proteins which may modulate AR-mediated transcription through protein-protein interactions, we utilized a co-immunoprecipitation assay of nuclear extracts from the AR-positive human prostate cancer LNCaP cells using antibody against AR (NH27). The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed with antibodies against various cofactors or general transcription factors. As shown in Fig.1, AR as well as p62 and cdk7, two subunits of TFIIH, were detected in the immunoprecipitated complex by anti-AR antibody. As human TFIIH consists of 6 core subunits (p89, p80, p62, p52, p44, and p34) and 3 catalytic subunits (MAT1, cyclin H, and cdk7) for the protein kinase moiety (39.Svejstrup J.Q. Vivhi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), our results may therefore suggest that the AR can interact with both the core and catalytic subunits of TFIIH in vivo. The interaction between the AR and TFIIH was resistant to the high ionic strength (0.4 mKCl) or high concentration of nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 (0.5%) (data not shown), suggesting tight interaction between the AR and TFIIH. Although AR interacts with both free CAK and CAK associated with TFIIH, it appears that AR may interact preferentially with free CAK based on quantitation of immunoprecipitated cdk7 and p62 (compare lanes 4 and 6 in Fig. 1). In addition, the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of LNCaP nuclear extract with anti-p62 antibody could not detect AR in the immunoprecipitated samples, suggesting that only a fraction of TFIIH is associated with AR. Rap74, the large subunit of another general transcription factor TFIIF, was also detected in the immunoprecipitated complex of LNCaP nuclear extracts with anti-human AR antibody (data not shown), although interaction between the AR and Rap74 was less resistant to high ionic strength or high concentration of nonionic detergent. In contrast, TBP or TFIIB was not detected in the immunoprecipitated complex of LNCaP nuclear extracts (data not shown) even in a low stringent condition (0.1 m KCl in the absence of Nonidet P-40). Taken together, our immunoprecipitation data suggest that AR can communicate with the general transcription machinery on the core promoter through the interaction with TFIIH and/or TFIIF. In order to examine the functional significance of the AR interaction with CAK, a transient transfection assay with cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1 in human prostate tumor cell lines was performed. Transfection of CAK subunits in LNCaP cells showed little effect on the reporter gene transactivation in the absence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 3). However, transfection of CAK subunits in LNCaP cells increased the AR-mediated transactivation 3–5-fold in the presence of 1 nm DHT (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and4). Similar results were also obtained when the CAK and AR were co-transfected into the AR-negative prostate cancer PC-3 cells (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, co-transfection of the CAK and AR into another AR-negative cell line, DU145, increased AR transactivation about 2–3-fold in the presence or absence of 1 nm DHT (Fig. 2 C). While the detailed mechanism by which CAK enhances AR-mediated transactivation in a ligand-dependent manner in LNCaP or PC-3 cells and in a ligand-independent manner in DU145 cells remains unclear, the results in Fig. 2 clearly indicate that CAK may function as a coregulator to enhance AR transactivation in prostate cancer cells. Given the fact that CAK is composed of three subunits, a transient transfection assay of these individual subunits was also performed. Although transfection of the individual subunits could moderately enhance AR transactivation, co-expression of the three subunits was most efficient in PC-3 (Fig.3 A) and DU145 cells (Fig.3 B). These data suggest that transfection of one subunit may be able to stimulate other endogeneous subunits to form an active CAK complex to enhance AR-mediated transactivation, although simultaneous transfection of three subunits renders higher induction of AR transactivation. As AR ligand-binding domain associated coregulators (ARAs) have been identified by yeast two-hybrid screening assay (6.Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 7.Kang H.Y. Yeh S. Fugimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8316-8321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), we were interested in comparing the coregulator activity of CAK with other ARAs in DU145 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, ARA70N and ARA55 induced AR transactivation only in the presence of 1 nm DHT. In contrast, CAK induced AR transactivation in the presence or absence of 1 nm DHT in DU145 cells, suggesting that different coregulators may utilize different mechanisms to enhance AR transactivation. A recent study suggests that the agonist activity of anti-androgens could be enhanced by selective coregulators, such as ARA70N and ARA55 (9.Fugimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Inui S. Chang H.-C. Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8316-8321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 40.Miyamoto H. Yeh S. Wilding G. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7379-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in determining the potential effects of anti-androgens on CAK-enhanced AR transactivation. As shown in Fig. 5, hydroxyflutamide, casodex, and RU58841, at the pharmacological concentration of 10−6m, efficiently inhibited the CAK-induced AR transactivation, suggesting that only selective AR coregulators may be able to modulate the agonist activity of antiandrogens. As AF-1 has been suggested to play an important role in the ligand-independent receptor activation and our data showed CAK could induce ligand-independent AR transactivation in DU145 cells (Fig. 2 C), we therefore analyzed whether CAK can activate the AR transactivation through the AF-1 domain. An expression vector for GAL4-ARN and the reporter plasmid E1b-luciferase containing 5 GAL4-binding sites were used to replace the full-length AR and the reporter plasmid murine mammary tumor virus-luciferase used in the previous transient transfection assay. As shown in Fig. 6, addition of GAL4-ARN resulted in approximately 4-fold induction of transcription of the reporter gene relative to GAL4-DBD alone in PC-3 cells (lanes 1 versus 3). While co-transfection of CAK did not enhance GAL4-DBD-mediated transcription (lanes 1 versus 2), co-transfection of CAK further enhanced GAL4-ARN mediated transcription approximately 2-fold (lanes 3 versus 4). When another GAL4-fused activator, GAL4-SP1, was used in place of GAL4-ARN, CAK co-transfection showed only a marginal effect on transcription of the reporter gene (lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that not every GAL4-fused activator could be enhanced by CAK and that CAK-induced GAL4-ARN transactivation was specific. Similar results were obtained when we replaced PC-3 cells with DU145 cells (data not shown). Together, these results clearly indicate that CAK-induced AR transactivation is mediated through the AR AF-1 domain. To further confirm that CAK may enhance AR transactivation through the AF-1 domain, interaction studies between the AR NH2-terminal domain and CAK subunits were performed.35S-Labeled cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1 were incubated with bacterial lysates containing histidine-tagged AR NH2-terminal domain (Fig. 7 lanes 2, 5, and 8). For the control, bacterial lysate without histidine-tagged AR NH2-terminal domain was used in parallel (lanes 3, 6, and 9). The proteins were bound to Ni resins, and the resins were extensively washed. The proteins eluted from the resins were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by PhosphorImager analysis. As shown in Fig. 7, the AR NH2-terminal domain did not retain MAT1, but efficiently retained cdk7 and cyclin H. These results strengthen our above data and suggest that the AR NH2-terminal domain can interact with cdk7 and cyclin H. As the AR NH2-terminal domain can also interact with the COOH-terminal domain for the maximal AR transactivation (41.Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), it will be an interesting question to pursue whether the AR activation function-2 domain can also contribute to the CAK-induced AR transactivation. In summary, CAK interacts with the AR NH2-terminal domain and enhances AR transactivation through AR AF-1. In this paper, we show that AR interacts with the general transcription factor TFIIH in a physiological condition (Fig. 1). A study of the physical interaction between the AR and TFIIH indicates that cdk7 and cyclin H, two subunits of CAK, specifically interact with the AR NH2-terminal domain (Fig. 7). Early studies showed that CAK could also interact with a few activators, such as POU domain and retinoic acid receptor α, and modulate their transcriptional activity (36.Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.-M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 42.Inamoto S. Segil N. Pan Z.Q. Kimura M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29852-29858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although it is unknown whether these interactions result in transcriptional activation through the same mechanism, it is generally accepted that they may modulate activity of the general transcription machinery on the promoter. The AR interaction with TFIIH may provide efficient communication between the AR and the general transcription factors/RNA polymerase II on the promoter. To analyze the significance of AR interaction with cdk7 and cyclin H in a physiological context, prostate cancer cell lines were used in a transient transfection assay. Co-transfection of CAK enhanced AR transactivation in LNCaP and PC-3 cells predominantly in a ligand-dependent manner and in prostate cancer DU145 cells in a ligand-independent manner (Fig. 2). The difference of the CAK effect on the ligand dependence of AR-mediated transactivation might be due to differences in cell environments of cell lines and needs to be further studied. The mechanism of CAK-induced AR transactivation was further analyzed using chimeric activators fused with the GAL4-DNA-binding domain (Fig. 6). The GAL4-ARN in conjunction with CAK could enhance transcription of the reporter gene containing 5 GAL4-binding sites much more efficiently than GAL4-Sp1 in conjunction with CAK. This result demonstrates that the AR AF-1 motif is required for the CAK-induced AR transactivation. Taken together, CAK interacts with the AR NH2-terminal domain and enhances AR transactivation through AR AF-1. CAK is a proline-directed protein kinase. The earlier studies showed that a fraction of CAK is associated with TFIIH (39.Svejstrup J.Q. Vivhi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Human TFIIH consists of 6 core subunits (p89, p80, p62, p52, p44, and p34) and 3 subunits (MAT1, cyclin H, and cdk7) for the protein kinase moiety (39.Svejstrup J.Q. Vivhi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). TFIIH-associated CAK can phosphorylate the COOH-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (39.Svejstrup J.Q. Vivhi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The phosphoryation of the COOH-terminal domain has been shown to be a key step needed to enter an elongation mode from the preinitiation complex formation on the promoter. The interaction between AR and TFIIH could enhance AR-mediated transcription through two different pathways. First, the AR bound TFIIH-associated CAK can enhance phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase COOH-terminal domain, which subsequently facilitates a transition from an initiation mode to an elongation mode. Second, the TFIIH-associated CAK could increase phosphorylation of AR. Phosphorylation of the receptor can play a pivotal role in regulation of the receptor, such as nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and interaction with regulatory proteins (28.Weigel N.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that the TFIIH-associated CAK can phosphorylate the NH2-terminal domain of retinoic acid receptor α and enhance its transactivation in a ligand-dependent manner (36.Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.-M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Other studies indicate that the CAK can also induce phosphorylation of glucocorticoid receptor or ER and lead to the ligand-independent activation of the receptors (35.Krstic M.D. Rogatsky I. Yamamoto K.R. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3947-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar,37.Trowbridge J.M. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10132-10137Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, the first pathway activates transcription through the enhanced efficiency of transcription elongation, while the second pathway activates transcription through the increasing number of preinitiation complexes formed on the core promoter. Since results of a co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrate that the AR associates with both core TFIIH and CAK, it is highly possible that the TFIIH-associated CAK interacts with the AR NH2-terminal domain and enhances AR-mediated transcription through the AR AF-1. Further studies may tell us how stimulation of the AR AF-1 by CAK results in the activation of AR-mediated transcription in prostate cancer cells.

Immunotoxins. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1988: 39-73Google Scholar), whereas ST, SLTs, and ricin inhibit protein synthesis by removing a specific adenine residue from 28 S ribosomal RNA (3.Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8128-8130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leaving toxin-modified ribosomes unable to carry out protein synthesis. Since the target substrates for all these toxins are present in the cytosol, a key feature of toxicity is the delivery of a catalytically active polypeptide or fragment into this cellular location. Cellular entry by the protein toxins listed above involves the same generalized mechanism. The toxin binds to a normal cell surface component, which is thus utilized as a toxin receptor. Surface-bound toxin enters the cell by endocytosis in both clathrin-coated and uncoated pits/vesicles (2.Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Frankel A.E. Immunotoxins.

During subsequent intracellular transport, DT, PE, ST, and SLT are cleaved by the membrane-associated protease, furin, to separate the cell-binding domain from the catalytic domain (5.Gordon V.M. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 333-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The furin cleavage site lies between two cysteines that are joined by a disulfide bond so that after proteolytic cleavage the resulting fragments remain covalently linked. The catalytically active (or A) chain (RTA) and the cell binding (or B) chain (RTB) of the plant toxin ricin are also synthesized as part of a single precursor protein (6.Lamb F.I. Roberts L.M.

When the appropriate intracellular compartment is reached by the endocytosed toxin, the enzymic peptide fragment translocates across the membrane to enter the cytosol. The site and mechanism of translocation into the cytosol are best understood in the case of DT, in which the ADP-ribosyltransferase polypeptide of DT (DTA) translocates from endosomes using a mechanism that requires the low pH environment of this organelle (8.Sandvig K. Tønnessen T.I. Sand O. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11639-11644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, both DTA and its cell binding polypeptide fragment (DTB) partially unfold (9.Hu V.W. Holmes R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12226-12233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Dumont M.E. Richards F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2087-2097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowing the transmembrane domain to insert into the endosomal membrane to form, or become part of, a translocation channel, through which partially folded DTA is able to pass (11.Zhan H. Choe S. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Eisenberg D. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11254-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12.Zhan H. Oh K.J. Shin Y.-K. Hubbell W.L. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4856-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). At the neutral pH of the cytosol, DTA then refolds into its active conformation. By contrast with DT, the compartment for ricin translocation has only very recently been identified. Thus, although early data pointed to translocation of the catalytic polypeptide (RTA) from endosomes (13.Beaumelle B. Alami M. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23661-23669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a wide body of data has now shown that RTA enters the cytosol from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), probably via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (14.Hazes B. Read R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11051-11054Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 15.Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, treating cells with brefeldin A protects against intoxication (16.Yoshida T. Chen C. Zhang M. Wu H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); addition of the ER retrieval signal (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL)) to the carboxyl terminus of RTA increases the cytotoxicity of whole ricin and free RTA (17.Wales R. Chaddock J.A. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18.Wales R. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23986-23990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); ricin cytotoxicity is sensitive to recycling between the ER and Golgi complex (19.Simpson J.C. Dascher C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20078-20082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); and a mutant form of RTA containing a tyrosine sulfation site and three overlapping glycosylation sites at the carboxyl terminus, was shown to be radiolabeled with Na235SO4within the trans-Golgi network, delivered to the ER lumen and glycosylated when added to cultured mammalian cells as part of the ricin holotoxin (20.Rapak A. Falsnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, temperature-sensitive mutants in the Sec61p translocon have been shown to be defective in RTA export from the ER to the cytosol, implicating ERAD as a possible route for cellular invasion by the toxin (21.Simpson J.C. Roberts L.M. Römisch K. Davey J. Wolf D.H. Lord J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism of cytosol entry, however, partial unfolding of RTA is likely to be a prerequisite for membrane traversal. Consistent with this, introduction of an engineered disulfide bond into RTA reduces ricin cytotoxicity (22.Argent R.H. Roberts L.M. Wales R. Robertus J.D. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26705-26710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present paper describes experiments that investigate the unfolding of RTA in vitro and the reversible folding of RTA in the presence of its ribosomal substrates. The data are consistent with a model in which RTA spontaneously unfolds in the ER lumen where, perhaps disguised as a misfolded protein, it invades the cytosol, probably using the natural ER quality control system. The newly emerging RTA then refolds in the cytosol, a process that appears to require its substrate ribosomes. As a consequence, this leads to the rapid depurination of 28 S rRNA and hence cell death. Recombinant ricin A chain was kindly provided by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals (Alderley Park, Cheshire, United Kingdom). Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer attached to a Neslab RTE-110 water bath, using 0.01 mg/ml RTA in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 2 mm DTT. The pathlength was 1 cm, and an excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured from 300 to 450 nm, and 4 scans were averaged. CD measurements were performed using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter attached to a Jasco PTE-348W Peltier heating system. Far UV CD spectra were accumulated from 250 to 190 nm using 0.04 mg/ml RTA in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 2 mm DTT, in a 0.1-cm pathlength cuvette. Near UV CD spectra were accumulated from 340 to 250 nm using 0.4 mg/ml RTA in the same buffer, using 1-cm pathlength cuvettes. All CD spectra were smoothed using the fast Fourier transform algorithm supplied with the Jasco J-715 software. RTA (0.02 mg/ml) in 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm DTT was incubated to different temperatures for 30 min and was then cooled on ice for 10 min. Thermolysin (final concentration 0.04 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.0, containing 5 mmCaCl2) was then added and protease digestion allowed to proceed for 60 min. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) and samples analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The catalytic activity of RTA was determined by a modification of the method of May et al. (23.May M.J. Hartley M.R. Roberts L.M. Krieg P.A. Osborn R.W. Lord J.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). RTA samples (1 ng/μl) were incubated at various temperatures for 30 min in 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer, 2 mm DTT, at pH 7.0, then allowed to cool to 30 °C. Rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes or deproteinizedE. coli rRNA (30 μg in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 (ENDO buffer)) were added to 1 or 720 ng of cooled RTA, respectively, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The rRNA was recovered, treated with aniline, and analyzed as described previously (23.May M.J. Hartley M.R. Roberts L.M. Krieg P.A. Osborn R.W. Lord J.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the N-glycosidase activity of RTA was carried out by incubation of salt-washed Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomes with different concentrations of native or partially unfolded RTA, as described above. The gels were Northern-blotted and probed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′ region of 26 S rRNA (24.Marchant A. Hartley M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 141-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activity was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, by determining the relative amount of labeled probe bound to the aniline-cleaved fragment (the amount bound to the aniline fragment as a proportion of the total bound to the fragment plus the unmodified 26 S rRNA). Solid-phase synthesis of oligoribonucleotides and their deprotection and purification were carried out as described previously (25.Murray J.B. Collies A.K. Arnold J.R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (25.Murray J.B. Collies A.K. Arnold J.R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the oligoribonucleotides were characterized by ESI MS on a Micromass bench-top platform II mass spectrometer. Synthetic oligoribonucleotide dodecamers were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP as follows; 40 pmol of dodecaribonucleotide was incubated with 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μm ATP, and 2 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase in buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT) at 37 °C for 10 min. The phosphorylated dodecaribonucleotide was then purified by electrophoresis in TBE on an 18% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea. The band corresponding to the end-labeled product was excised from the gel, eluted into 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate at 37 °C overnight, then ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 15 μg of yeast tRNA as a carrier. Activity assays of RTA on the synthetic oligoribonucleotides were carried out essentially by the method of Allerson and Verdine (26.Allerson C.R. Verdine G.L. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 667-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Prior to use in activity assays, the γ-32P-labeled oligoribonucleotides were renatured as follows; 12 μm unlabeled dodecaribonucleotide containing small amounts of the γ-32P-labeled rRNA (approximately 50 nm) were incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 at 90 °C for 5 min, then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Activity assays were set up consisting of 12 μm renatured oligoribonucleotide in reaction buffer (1.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 11% (v/v) glycerol), to which was added 1 μm RTA. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C, and 10-μl aliquots removed at various times from 0 to 120 min. Each sample was quenched with 1% (w/v) SDS, extracted twice with phenol/chloroform, the rRNA oligoribonucleotides recovered by precipitation with sodium acetate and ethanol in the presence of 5 μg of yeast tRNA, and resuspended in 4 μl of water. The samples were subsequently treated with 20 μl of 1 m aniline, pH 4.8, as described above, except that the samples were incubated at 40 °C for 30 min. The samples were resolved by electrophoresis on an 18% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, in TBE, and the results visualized by autoradiography. Unfortunately, assays could not be performed on the partially folded state of RTA generated by renaturation from 4.2 m GdmCl, since the residual denaturant inhibited the RTA cleavage assay against both ribosomes and the 12-mer oligoribonucleotide. Far UV CD spectra of RTA at pH 7.0 (the approximate pH within the ER lumen of mammalian cells) and at different temperatures are shown in Fig.1 a. The spectra indicate that at 42 °C and below, RTA contains significant helical structure, consistent with its known x-ray structure (27.Katzin B.J. Collins E.J. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The protein is relatively unstable at pH 7.0; at temperatures above 42 °C, the protein starts to denature, judged by the decreased ellipticity in the far UV at 45 °C and above. Near UV CD spectra also indicate that RTA is relatively unstable at pH 7.0, with all tertiary structure involving tyrosine and tryptophan residues apparently denaturing by 45 °C (Fig. 1 b). A closer examination of the data in Fig. 1reveals that thermal denaturation of RTA is not a cooperative (two-state) process, since tertiary structure denatures prior to secondary structure as judged by far and near UV CD. Thus, at 45 °C the protein has little or no tertiary structure (Fig. 1 b) but retains significant secondary structure (Fig. 1 a), indicating population of a partially unfolded species. When the temperature is increased to 55 °C and above, RTA becomes substantially denatured and no further decrease in ellipticity in the far UV occurs as the temperature is raised above this value (Fig.1 a). Partially unfolded RTA formed at 45 °C was next tested for its capacity to refold to the native protein upon cooling. RTA at pH 7.0 was thus incubated at 30 °C, rapidly heated to 45 °C for 30 min, then cooled to 30 °C, and the ability of the protein to refold measured by far UV CD and tryptophan fluorescence (RTA contains a single tryptophan residue (Trp-211), which is buried and forms part of the active site (27.Katzin B.J. Collins E.J. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and is invariant in all members of the RTA family of ribosome-inactivating proteins (28.Funatsu G. Islam M.R. Minami Y. Sung-Sil K. Kimura M. Biochimie. 1991; 73: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). The data in Fig. 2 show that partially unfolded RTA does not refold upon cooling, judged by both far UV CD (Fig.2 a) and fluorescence of Trp211 (Fig. 2 b). As an additional test, RTA was denatured in 4.2 m GdmCl, pH 7.0, then rapidly diluted 10-fold to renature the protein. Again, unfolding was irreversible, RTA forming a partially unfolded species, as judged by far UV CD and fluorescence measurements (Fig. 2, c andd) under these conditions. Unfolding was also irreversible when RTA denatured in 4.2 m GdmCl, pH 7.0, was diluted 30-fold to initiate refolding. Despite surveying a wide variety of conditions, no conditions could be found under which unfolding was reversible, even when very dilute samples (<0.3 μm) of RTA were used (the results obtained were independent of protein concentration over the range from 0.4 to 0.01 mg/ml). Gel filtration analysis of partially unfolded RTA formed by transient heating to 45 °C demonstrated that the protein is compact, and there is no evidence for the presence of dimers or higher molecular weight species in the partially unfolded ensemble, ruling out aggregation as a possible cause of the irreversibility. Denaturation of partially unfolded RTA formed by transient heating to 45 °C or by renaturation from high concentrations of GdmCl, was also examined by titration with GdmCl using far UV CD (Fig. 3 a). As expected, GdmCl denaturation of native RTA displays a sigmoidal denaturation curve typical of that expected for unfolding a native polypeptide of this molecular weight. Interestingly, GdmCl denaturation of native RTA monitored by near UV CD also highlights the instability and non-cooperativity of native RTA, since all tertiary structure is denatured at approximately 2.3 m GdmCl, at which concentration about 50% of the native far UV CD signal persists (data not shown). By contrast with native RTA, denaturation of partially unfolded RTA is a much less cooperative process, the lack of a pre-transition base line and the large denaturant concentration range required to fully unfold the protein being typical features of the unfolding of a partially unfolded ensemble. Consistent with this, partially unfolded RTA formed at 45 °C or by renaturation from 4.2m GdmCl displays an increase in the fluorescence intensity of ANS coupled with a blue shift in λmax above that of the native or fully denatured protein (data not shown). Partially unfolded RTA is also susceptible to thermolysin digestion, whereas the native protein is highly resistant (Fig. 3 b). The data thus indicate that partially unfolded RTA is compact, contains significant secondary structure, lacks fixed tertiary interactions, unfolds non-cooperatively, is protease-sensitive, and binds ANS; these features are typical of molten globular states (29.Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RTA is an N-glycosidase that removes a specific adenine base from a highly conserved loop in 28 S rRNA (30.Chan Y.L. Endo Y. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12768-12770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphodiester bonds on either side of the depurination site become susceptible to aniline hydrolysis after RTA modification such that a 394-nucleotide fragment is released that is diagnostic of RTA depurination (23.May M.J. Hartley M.R. Roberts L.M. Krieg P.A. Osborn R.W. Lord J.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). RTA was assayed for catalytic activity following incubation at 30 °C, 45 °C, 55 °C, and 65 °C for 30 min and subsequent cooling to 30 °C for 10 min. At 30 °C RTA is native (Fig. 1) and catalytically active (Fig. 4 a,lane 1). Surprisingly, partially unfolded RTA formed by transient heating to 45 °C also appeared to be catalytically active (Fig. 4 a, lane 2), even though this species has no fixed tertiary structure, particularly involving the unique active site tryptophan (Fig. 1 b). As partially unfolded RTA formed by transient heating does not refold upon cooling (Fig. 2 a), nor upon further dilution or upon changing the buffer conditions during heating to those used in the activity assay (as judged by far UV CD), the data suggest that refolding of partially unfolded RTA is induced by the ribosomes. The possibility that ribosome-associated chaperones are responsible for this activity was eliminated by re-examining the activity of the different species in the presence of salt-washed yeast ribosomes from which ribosome-associated chaperones have been removed. A quantification, based on a comparison of the 26 S rRNA depurination activity of a dilution series of partially unfolded RTA with corresponding concentrations of native RTA, indicated that full catalytic activity had been restored to the partially unfolded species (Fig. 4 b). The results thus suggest that the ribosomes themselves are responsible for refolding RTA. To test whether reactivation of partially unfolded RTA requires intact ribosomes, or only the rRNA component of its ribosomal substrate, the ability of short stem-loop rRNA molecules to reactivate RTA was investigated. Small rRNA molecules containing the GAGA tetraloop essential for recognition have been shown to be substrates for RTA (31.Endo Y. Chan Y.-L. Lin A. Tsurugi K. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7917-7920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Endo Y. Glück A. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 33.Glück A.

Two dodecaribonucleotides were thus synthesized, one (5′-CUCAGAGAUGAG-3′; wild-type) encompassing the 12 ribonucleotides surrounding the GAGA recognition site in 28 S rRNA, and the second (5′-CUCAGdAGXUGAG-3′; rHA12) containing a deoxyribonucleotide in the recognition motif and the adenine analogue 2′-deoxy-2-aminopurine (X) to provide a possible fluorescent probe. Similar oligoribonucleotides have been shown to form a stem-loop structure by NMR studies, and to be substrates for RTA depurination (they bind RTA with similar affinity as intact ribosomes but have a considerably reduced k cat (by a factor of 105); see Refs. 34.Glück A. Endo Y. Wool I.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and 36.Orita M. Nishikawa F. Kohno T. Senda T. Mitsui Y. Endo Y. Taira K. Nishikawa S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Each oligoribonucleotide was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, gel-purified, and then used in an assay for catalytic activity of native RTA, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected, native RTA cleaves both rHA12 (Fig. 5) and the wild-type dodecaribonucleotide (data not shown) to produce the expected 5-mer radiolabeled product, the former being cleaved more rapidly in accord with published data that incorporation of a deoxyadenine in the recognition site increases the k cat 26-fold (36.Orita M. Nishikawa F. Kohno T. Senda T. Mitsui Y. Endo Y. Taira K. Nishikawa S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Whereas native RTA is able to depurinate rHA12 (Fig. 5), partially unfolded RTA formed by transient heating to 45 °C displays no detectable activity. This indicates that few, if any, native molecules persist after RTA is heated to 45 °C (more than 99% of intact rHA12 remained after incubation with partially unfolded RTA for 120 min) and that the small 12-mer oligoribonucleotide cannot refold the partially unfolded protein. In accord with these data, incubation of partially unfolded RTA with a 5-fold excess of rHA12 does not induce protein refolding, as judged by far UV CD. Similar experiments in the presence of excess yeast tRNA or the nonspecific protein, bovine serum albumin, were also unable to restore catalytic activity against the 12-mer oligoribonucleotide (data not shown). Although intact E. coli ribosomes are not cleaved by RTA, deproteinized E. coli rRNA is a substrate for the enzyme (38.Marchant A. Hartley M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Incubation of native RTA (720 ng) with rRNA (30 μg) resulted in depurination of both the 16 S and 23 S rRNA components as previously observed (38.Marchant A. Hartley M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By contrast, incubation of rRNA with partially unfolded RTA did not result in depurination, either when assayed directly in acetate buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, 100 mm sodium chloride) or following pre-incubation for 30 min with E. coli rRNA in ENDO buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) at 37 °C prior to the assay (data not shown). These data are consistent with the inability of partially unfolded RTA to depurinate the small dodecaribonucleotide and suggest that intact ribosomes are required for refolding and reactivation of the partially unfolded species. Experiments to directly test this result, by the pre-incubation of partially unfolded RTA with ribosomes prior to the addition of radiolabeled oligoribonucleotide in the assay described above, have been attempted. These experiments were not feasible, however, since ribosomes are much better substrates for depurination by RTA than synthetic oligoribonucleotides or deproteinized rRNA, ribosomes being turned over more than 100,000 times faster than purified RNA species (34.Glück A. Endo Y. Wool I.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36.Orita M. Nishikawa F. Kohno T. Senda T. Mitsui Y. Endo Y. Taira K. Nishikawa S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, attempts to directly monitor RTA refolding by mixing partially unfolded RTA with ribosomes and subsequently separating these species, for example by centrifugation, were not possible because the ribosomes cannot be completely separated from the RTA. Despite these difficulties, the results shown in Figs. 1, 4, and 5 indicate that partially unfolded RTA that has lost all apparent tertiary structure regains full catalytic activity in the presence of its intact ribosomal substrate. Although it was initially assumed, by analogy to DT, that the enzymic polypeptides of other protein toxins such as ricin, PE, and ST would also cross the endosomal membrane to enter the cytosol, it is now clear that the latter group of toxins gain entry to the cytosol via retrograde transport to the ER lumen probably using the ERAD pathway (see Ref. 15.Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar for a review). Here we have shown that the conformational properties of RTA are ideally suited to its translocation from the ER, in that the conformational lability and non-cooperativity of the protein at pH 7.0 permits relatively frequent unfolding events and population of partially unfolded molecules even close to ambient temperature. If unfolding is irreversible, as shown here in vitro, partially unfolded molecules could become significantly populated even under conditions where the native state is thermodynamically stable. Moreover, since unfolding and membrane traversal of only a few RTA molecules is sufficient to kill the cell, these processes need not be highly efficient for ricin intoxication. We have shown that partially unfolded RTA is compact, retains significant secondary structure but has little or no fixed tertiary structure, is protease-sensitive, and binds ANS; these are features typical of a molten globule species (29.Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, such species have been purported to be capable of membrane traversal (39.Bychkova V.E. Dujsekina A.E. Klenin S.I. Tiktopulo E.I. Uversky V.N. Ptitsyn O.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6058-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 40.Van der Goot F.G. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In parallel studies we have shown that RTA is stabilized at acidic pH values, such that at pH 5.5 (close to the pH of endosomes) the midpoint of thermal denaturation is raised by approximately 10 °C (41.Argent R.H. Studies on the in Vivo Processing and in Vitro Conformational Changes of Ricin A Chain. Ph.D. thesis. University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom1997Google Scholar). Thus, RTA does not respond to low pH in the same way as DT, consistent with its site of translocation being distinct from the endosomal system. It appears, therefore, that the conformational lability and unfolding properties of RTA at pH 7.0 are ideally suited to its translocation from the ER. The significance of the partially unfolded species of RTA in terms of the membrane translocation step may well extend beyond simply producing a form of the toxin appropriate for membrane traversal. Thus, the presence of the partially unfolded species itself within the ER lumen might trigger its export by activating the ERAD pathway. For some time, the ER has been known to possess a system capable of degrading misfolded or non-assembled proteins (42.Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), through their export to the cytosol and subsequent degradation by cytosolic ubiquitin/proteasome machinery (see Ref. 43.Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar for review). Recently it has become evident that this ER-associated protein degradation of misfolded or incorrectly assembled proteins occurs via the Sec61p translocation channel (44.Wiertz E.J.H.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M., Yu, J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 45.Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 46.Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) such that aberrant proteins are ejected from the lumen through the translocon and degraded in the cytosol. As the export machinery can clearly differentiate between native and misfolded protein conformations, the partial unfolding of RTA may result in the polypeptide masquerading as a substrate for export into the cytosol. While partial unfolding of RTA may be a prerequisite for membrane translocation, the protein must regain catalytic activity in the cytosol. If unfolding in vivo resembles that shown herein vitro under a wide range of conditions, it seems unlikely that the partially unfolded species of RTA could spontaneously refold into its native, catalytically active conformation in the cytosol. Refolding in vitro requires the presence of intact ribosomes, as dodecaribonucleotide containing the substrate GAGA tetraloop or naked rRNA is unable to reactivate the partially unfolded species. It appears, therefore, that ribosomal proteins alone or in conjunction with rRNA are facilitating refolding. Interestingly, intact ribosomes and ribosomal components have previously been shown to possess chaperone activity (47.Fedorov A.N. Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Alakhov Y.B. Goldberg M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 48.Das B. Chattopadhyay S. Bera A.K. Dasgupta C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 49.Kudlicki W. Coffman A. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Folding Design. 1997; 2: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that ribosome-mediated refolding of RTA may not be an entirely substrate-induced phenomenon, but could also utilize the chaperone activity of its substrate ribosomes. The observation that purified oligoribonucleotides and rRNA substrates do not induce refolding is consistent with this view. In vivo, the possibility remains that cytosolic chaperones such as those belonging to the hsp70 class may also be involved in facilitating the unfolding and/or refolding steps, and may help to stabilize partially unfolded molecules. What is the relevance of these observations for the refolding of RTAin vivo? Our data suggest the intriguing possibility that RTA utilizing the ERAD pathway would readily encounter substrate ribosomes upon its emergence into the cytosol. Such an encounter would reactivate the protein and prevent degradation of the toxin by proteasomes. Interestingly, this also suggests competition between ribosome-facilitated refolding and degradation. Consistent with this, we have observed that treating mammalian cells with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin causes a small but significant (approximately 3-fold) sensitization to the toxin. 2D. C. Smith, L. M. Roberts, and J. M. Lord, unpublished data. Reactivation would be suicidal, since it would immediately result in depurination of the 28 S rRNA of the ribosome and the consequent inhibition of protein synthesis. If this is the case, the toxin would appear to have evolved an effective mechanism of cell entry and destruction. The next stage will be to devise experiments to test these results in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2048113121,"Chelerythrine, a natural benzophenanthridine alkaloid, has been reported to mediate a variety of biological activities, including inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC). Here we report that chelerythrine induced time- and dose-dependent activation of JNK1 and p38 in HeLa cells, which was mediated the upstream kinases, MEKK1 and MKK4. However, treatment with two other potent and selective PKC inhibitors, GF-109203X and Gö6983, or down-regulation of PKC activity by prolonged treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate had no effect on JNK1 and p38 activities. Furthermore, under the conditions where JNK1 and p38 were activated, we did not observe any significant inhibitory effect of chelerythrine on the activities of PKC isozymes present in HeLa cells. Interestingly, pretreatment with the antioxidants,N-acetyl-l-cysteine, dithiothreitol, and glutathione, impaired chelerythrine-induced JNK1 and p38 activation. In addition, chelerythrine induced apoptosis that was blocked by the antioxidants and the dominant-negative mutants of MEKK1, MKK4, JNK1, and p38. Together, these results uncover a novel biochemical property of chelerythrine, i.e. activation of MEKK1- and MKK4-dependent JNK1 and p38 pathways through an oxidative stress mechanism, which mediate the induction of apoptosis, but are independent of PKC inhibition.

The core part of a MAPK pathway, also called MAPK module, consists of three kinases: a MAPK, a MAPK kinase (MEK or MKK), and a MAPK kinase kinase (MEKK) (3.Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 4.Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). MAPK is activated by the dual phosphorylation on Tyr and Thr residues by a member of MEKs or MKKs, which, in turn, are activated by an upstream MEKK. To date, at least six MAPK members have been identified in mammalian cells. Three of them have been extensively studied: the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) (5.Gomez N. Cohen P. Nature. 1991; 353: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs, also referred to as stress-activated protein kinases) (6.Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A.

The ERK pathway is predominantly activated by mitogens through a Ras-dependent mechanism (9.Avruch J. Zhang X. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem.

Unlike ERK, however, JNK and p38 are regulated by distinct MAPK modules and are preferentially activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (11.Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J.

Activation of JNK and p38 has been implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes such as T cell activation (18.Warlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), production of cytokines (19.Young P.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (PKC) represents a family of serine/threonine kinases, which presently consists of at least 11 isozymes (23.Nishizuka Y. Cell. 1992; 258: 607-613Google Scholar, 24.Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). According to their structure and cofactor regulation, these isozymes have been classified into three groups as follows: (i) conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) that are activated by calcium or diacylglycerol; (ii) novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, θ, and μ) that are independent of calcium but responsive to diacylglycerol; (iii) atypical PKCs (ζ and λ/ι) that do not require either calcium or diacylglycerol for activation. A large number of studies indicate that PKC serves as a central signaling molecule and regulates a variety of cellular processes either directly or through integration with other signaling pathways (23.Nishizuka Y. Cell. 1992; 258: 607-613Google Scholar). PKC has been shown to activate Ras-MAPK pathway, leading to cell proliferation (25.Morrison P. Saltiel A.R. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12891-12896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Activation of a certain PKC isozyme has also been shown to regulate T cell activation through a JNK-dependent pathway (18.Warlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Recently, PKC has been demonstrated to prevent apoptosis in different cell lines, presumably by increasing phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (26.Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 27.Gubina E. Rinaudo M.S. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Mufson R.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 823-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, inhibition of PKC has been shown to result in apoptosis (28.Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar,29.Freemerman A. Turner A. Birrer M. Szabo E. Valerie K. Grant S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 788-795PubMed Google Scholar). Chelerythrine is a natural benzophenanthridine alkaloid that displays a wide range of biological activities such as anti-platelet (30.Ko F.N. Chen I.S. Wu S.J. Lee G.L. Huang T.F. Teng C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), anti-inflammatory (31.Lenfeld J. Kroutil M. Marsalek E. Slavik J. Preininger V. Simanek V. Planta Med. 1981; 43: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and antibacterial effects (31.Lenfeld J. Kroutil M. Marsalek E. Slavik J. Preininger V. Simanek V. Planta Med. 1981; 43: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Most notably, chelerythrine exhibits anti-tumor property (32.Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar) and induces apoptosis in murine lymphoma (33.Chmura S.J. Nodzenski E. Weichselbaum R.R. Quintans J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2711-2714PubMed Google Scholar) and human leukemia (28.Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar, 29.Freemerman A. Turner A. Birrer M. Szabo E. Valerie K. Grant S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 788-795PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, chelerythrine has the potential for drug development against cancers. Since chelerythrine was described previously to be an inhibitor of PKC (32.Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar), the biological effects of chelerythrine have been presumably ascribed to the inhibition of PKC; however, a number of recent studies indicate that PKC-independent mechanisms are involved (34.von Stebut E. Amon U. Herbert J.M. Wolff H.H. Agents Actions. 1994; 41: C56-C57Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 35.Lombardini J.B.

In this study, we investigated the involvement of MAPKs and their relationship with PKC in chelerythrine-treated HeLa cells. As reported below, chelerythrine strongly stimulated JNK1 and p38, but not ERK2, activities. Interestingly, chelerythrine did inhibit the PKC activity under the conditions where JNK1 and p38 were activated. Furthermore, blocking JNK and p38 pathways suppressed chelerythrine-induced apoptosis. Thus, activation of MAPK pathways represents a novel biochemical effect of chelerythrine. HeLa cells (human cervical squamous carcinoma) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were normally starved overnight in serum-free medium before treatment, unless otherwise indicated. Histidine-tagged JNK1 protein and polyclonal antibodies against ERK2, MEKK1, and SEK1 were purchased from the Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa, Cruz, CA).

GST-ATF2-(1–96)-expressing plasmid (pGEX-GST-ATF2) was kindly provided by Dr. J. Silvio Gutkind (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). MKK4 mutant plasmid, pcDNA3-Flag-MKK4(ala), was a gift from Dr. Roger J. Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester). Expression vectors for kinase mutants, pUna3-MEKK1(KR), pc-DNA3-Flag-JNK1(APF), and pCMV-Flag-p38(AGF), were described previously (22.Chen Y.R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). After treatments, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in cell lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 100 μmNa3VO4, 5 μm ZnCl2, 2 mm iodoacetic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Cell lysates were homogenized by passing through a 23-gauge needle three times. The homogenates were left on ice for 30 min before centrifugation at 12,500 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Kinase activities of JNK1, p38, ERK2, SEK1, and MEKK1 in the supernatants were determined by in vitro immunocomplex kinase assays as described previously (39.Yu R. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, an equal amount of protein, as measured by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad), was incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of protein A-Sepharose 4B conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). The immunocomplex was spun down at high speed for 1 min and washed twice with the lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in a 30-μl kinase assay buffer with addition of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μg of the indicated substrates. Kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min in JNK1, p38, SEK1, and MEKK1 assays, or 15 min in ERK2 assay, and then terminated with 10 μl of 4× Laemmli's buffer. The reaction mixtures were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, washed overnight, and dried. The phosphorylated products were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (AMBIS, Inc., San Diego, CA). After washing twice with ice-cold PBS, cells were harvested in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 2 mmDTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupetin, and 1% Triton® X-100. Cell lysates were homogenized by passing through a 23-gauge needle four times and left on ice for 30 min before centrifugation at 12,500 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The total PKC activity in the resulting supernatants was isolated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described previously (40.Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Wilson J.C. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were applied to a 0.5-ml DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm DTT). After washing column with 2 ml of buffer A, PKCs were eluted with 0.2 m NaCl, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad). For PKC activity assay, 2 μg of isolated enzymes was incubated with 10 μg of histone H1 in a 50-μl assay buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP. The kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 10 min and terminated with Laemmli's buffer. The phosphorylated histone H1 was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. To assay the individual PKC isozyme activity, different isozymes were immunoprecipitated directly from cell lysates with their respective antibodies as described previously (41.Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. PKC activity was analyzed by electrophoresis as described above and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (AMBIS, Inc., San Diego, CA). The results were expressed as a percentage, relative to solvent-treated controls. After treatment with different agents, H2DCFDA (5 μm) was added to the medium and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min as described previously (39.Yu R. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped off the plate. Following centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 5 min, cell pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 5 μm H2DCFDA. The fluorescence intensities of H2DCFDA of more than 10,000 viable cells from each sample were analyzed by using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer with excitation and emission settings of 488 and 525 nm, respectively. Prior to data collection, propidium iodide was added to the sample to gate out dead cells. After treatments, floating cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 15 min, and attached cells were first trypsinized and then harvested by centrifugation. Apoptotic cells with condensed or fragmented nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining as described previously (42.Yu R. Mandlekar S. Harvey K.J. Ucker D.S. Kong A.-N.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 402-408PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS before fixing in a solution of methanol:acetic acid (3:1) for 30 min. Fixed cells were placed on slides. After evaporation of fixing solution, cells were stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI for 15 min. The nuclear morphology of cells was examined by a fluorescence microscopy. Approximately 107cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton® X-100 for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were vortexed and cleared by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 20 min. DNA in supernatant was extracted with an equal volume of neutral phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol mixture (25:24:1) at room temperature for 15 min and precipitated with 2 volumes of 100% ethanol and one-tenth volume of 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) overnight at −20 °C. The DNA precipitates were spun down at 12,500 ×g for 20 min and washed once with 70% ethanol. The air-dried DNA pellets were incubated with 5 μg/ml DNase-free RNase in a 40-μl Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 2 h. Fragmented DNA was resolved on 1.5% agarose gels in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. HeLa cells were plated in 6-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with a β-galactosidase-expressing reporter construct together with an empty vector or the plasmids as indicated using calcium phosphate precipitation method. Transfection mixture was removed 12 h after transfection. Cells were cultured in fresh medium for 12 h before treatment with chelerythrine. Cells were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Result was expressed as the percentage of round blue cells among the β-galactosidase-positive cells. After treatment, cell lysates were prepared as described above. Twenty five μg of total protein, as determined by Bradford assay, was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry transfer system (Fisher). The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 8 g/liter NaCl, and 0.2 g/liter KCl) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with 1 μg/ml of the indicated primary antibodies in TBS containing 3% non-fat milk at 4 °C overnight. Membrane was washed three times with TBS and blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. After washing three times with TBS, the protein was visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chelerythrine has been reported to inhibit PKC activity with an IC50 of 0.66 μm (32.Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of chelerythrine on JNK1 activity, we treated HeLa cells with the concentrations of chelerythrine around this IC50. Cells were collected 2 h after treatment, and the endogenous JNK1 activity was determined by immunocomplex kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 1 A, chelerythrine strongly stimulated JNK1 activity. The activation of JNK1 appeared at 1 μm and was greatly enhanced with the increase of chelerythrine concentrations. Approximately a 9-fold induction of JNK1 activity was seen at a concentration of 2.5 μm as compared with untreated control cells. To characterize further JNK1 activation by chelerythrine, we studied the time course. Induction of JNK1 activity became evident 30 min after treatment with 2.5 μm chelerythrine and reached the maximum at 2 h (Fig. 1 B). The induced JNK1 activity decreased and returned to basal levels 4 h post-treatment (Fig. 1 B). Western blotting analysis revealed no change in the protein levels of JNK1 throughout dose-response and time course studies (Fig. 1, Aand B), indicating that JNK1 activation by chelerythrine was not due to de novo protein synthesis. Although different members of MAPKs are often responsive to different extracellular signals, they can also be activated by the same stimuli,e.g. proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stresses induced JNK, p38, and ERK kinase activities concomitantly (11.Raingeaud J.

Invest. 1996; 98: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We therefore measured the activities of p38 and ERK2 following treatment of HeLa cells with various concentrations of chelerythrine. Similar to JNK1, p38 activity was strongly induced by chelerythrine in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). Western blotting showed that such induction was not due to the increase of protein levels of p38 (Fig. 1 C). When ERK2 activity was measured, a strong induction was detected in PMA-treated cells but not in chelerythrine-treated cells (Fig. 1 D). To exclude the possibility that ERK2 activity was measured at an unfavorable time point after treatment with chelerythrine, we also performed a time course study. But no ERK2 activation was observed (data not shown). These results revealed that chelerythrine preferentially induced JNK1 and p38 activation, but had no effect ERK2 activity. Because incubation of chelerythrine with the immunoprecipitated JNK1 or p38 did not stimulate their kinase activities (data not shown), we speculate that there is the involvement of upstream kinases. Previous studies have shown that activation of JNK by various stimuli is mediated by MEKK1. We therefore examined the effects of chelerythrine on MEKK1 activity. HeLa cells were treated with chelerythrine (2.5 μm) for the indicated times. Endogenous MEKK1 was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody, and kinase activity was assayed with a kinase-inactive GST-SEK1 fusion protein as substrate. Chelerythrine induced MEKK1 activation in a time-dependent fashion (Fig.2 A). The stimulated MEKK1 activity was detected as early as 15 min after treatment, preceding JNK1 activation shown in Fig. 1 B. Because MEKK1 is unable to phosphorylate JNK directly, we next examined the activation of MKK4 or SEK1, a kinase that has been shown to interact specifically with MEKK1 and activate JNK1 (44.Xia Y. Wu Z.G. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, chelerythrine also stimulated MKK4/SEK1 kinase activity, which appeared at 15 min and peaked 1 h after chelerythrine treatment. Thus, both MEKK1 and MKK4 are activated upon treatment with chelerythrine. Furthermore, cotransfection with a dominant-negative mutant MEKK1(KR) or MKK4(ala) impaired chelerythrine-induced JNK1 activation (Fig. 2 C) as well as p38 activation (Fig. 2 D). These results provide strong evidence that the upstream kinases, MEKK1 and MKK4, mediate the activation of JNK1 and p38 by chelerythrine. Chelerythrine has been described to be an inhibitor of PKC (32.Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar) and also strongly activated JNK and p38 as demonstrated above. We wondered whether inhibition of PKC might serve as a general signal to initiate JNK or p38 pathway. To test this, we examined the effects of two other potent PKC inhibitors, GF-109203X and Gö6983. Previous studies have shown that GF-109203X selectively inhibits the isozymes, α, β, γ, δ, and ε (45.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Gö6983 selectively inhibits α, β, γ, δ, and ζ PKC isozymes (46.Stempka L. Girod A. Muller H.-J. Rincke G. Marks F. gschwendt M. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6805-6811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Unlike chelerythrine, treatment of HeLa cells with GF-109203X or Gö6983 did not stimulate JNK1 activity (Fig.3 A). Furthermore, pretreatment with these two inhibitors had little effect on chelerythrine-induced JNK1 activation (Fig. 3 B). We also examined the effect of down-regulation of PKC on JNK1 activity. HeLa cells were pretreated with PMA (100 nm) for 36 h, prior to challenge with chelerythrine for different times. The result in Fig. 3 Cshows that prolonged treatment with PMA had no effect on JNK1 activity and did not affect chelerythrine-induced JNK1 activation either. Similar results were obtained when p38 activity was measured (Fig.3 D). These data indicate that inhibition of PKC does not necessarily leads to JNK or p38 activation and raise the possibility that chelerythrine-induced JNK1 and p38 activation is independent of PKC. To define further the role of PKC in chelerythrine-induced JNK and p38 activation, we examined the effect of chelerythrine on PKC activity. GF-109203X and Gö6983 were also included in this experiment. As expected, GF-109203X and Gö6983 inhibited PKC activity when added to cell culture medium (Fig.4 A); however, at the concentrations that strongly induced JNK1 and p38 activation, chelerythrine did not show any inhibitory effect on PKC activity. To exclude the possibility that the lack of inhibitory effect of chelerythrine is due to the dissociation of the compound from PKC during the isolation procedure, we conducted the in vitroassays.

KDO8P is the phosphorylated precursor of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate, an essential sugar of the lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria. The crystal structure of the Escherichia coli KDO8P synthase has been determined by multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction and the model has been refined to 2.4 Å (R-factor, 19.9%;R-free, 23.9%). KDO8P synthase is a homotetramer in which each monomer has the fold of a (β/α)8 barrel. On the basis of the features of the active site, PEP and A5P are predicted to bind with their phosphate moieties 13 Å apart such that KDO8P synthesis would proceed via a linear intermediate.

In the active site of DAH7P synthase the two substrates PEP and erythrose 4-phosphate appear to bind in a configuration similar to that proposed for PEP and A5P in the active site of KDO8P synthase. This observation suggests that KDO8P synthase and DAH7P synthase evolved from a common ancestor and that they adopt the same catalytic strategy. 3-Deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO8P) synthase catalyzes the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) to form KDO8P and inorganic phosphate.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). KDO provides a link between lipid A, the membrane embedded moiety of LPS, and the O-antigen, an elongated polysaccharide chain that protrudes from the bacterial outer membrane into the surrounding environment and determines the antigenic specificity of the cell. Although the composition of the O-antigen varies between species and also between strains, the inner core region containing KDO is fairly constant among all Gram-negative bacteria (2.Ray P.H. Kelsey J.E. Bigham E.C. Benedict C.D. Miller T. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1983; 231: 141-169Crossref Google Scholar). 3-Deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8P synthase, EC 4.1.2.16) plays a key role in the biosynthesis of KDO. This enzyme catalyzes the aldol-type condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) to form KDO8P (precursor to KDO) and inorganic phosphate (Fig. 1) (3.Levin D.H. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2532-2539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of KDO8P to KDO and synthesis of CMP-KDO (from CTP and KDO) occur prior to insertion of the sugar into LPS (2.Ray P.H. Kelsey J.E. Bigham E.C. Benedict C.D. Miller T. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1983; 231: 141-169Crossref Google Scholar). Strains ofSalmonella have been isolated with mutations in KDO8P synthase that confer temperature-sensitive growth (4.Rick P.D. Young D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 447-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Rick P.D. Neumeyer B.A. Young D.A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1984; 6: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Such strains fail to synthesize KDO at the nonpermissive temperature, which leads to the inhibition of LPS biosynthesis and, as a consequence, to the arrest of cell growth. These studies indicate that KDO8P synthase provides an essential function for bacterial homeostasis. Earlier studies have determined that the reaction of KDO8P synthesis is a sequential process in which the binding of PEP precedes the binding of A5P and the release of inorganic phosphate precedes the release of KDO8P (6.Kohen A. Jakob A. Baasov T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The condensation step of the reaction is stereospecific, involving the addition of the si face of C3PEPto the re face of the A5P carbonyl (7.Kohen A. Berkovich R. Belakhov V. Baasov T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1993; 3: 1577-1582Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8.Dotson G.D. Nanjappan P. Reily M.D. Woodard R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12392-12397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has also been established that phosphate release occurs by cleavage of the C-O bond of PEP (9.Hedstrom L. Abeles R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10.Dotson G.D. Dua R.K. Clemens J.C. Wooten E.W. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13698-13705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and that the anomeric oxygen of the product KDO8P originates from bulk solvent (10.Dotson G.D. Dua R.K. Clemens J.C. Wooten E.W. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13698-13705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic details of the condensation reaction remain unclear and very little is known about the residues of the enzyme that are involved in catalysis. As an aid to understanding the mechanism of KDO8P synthase, we have determined the crystal structure of the Escherichia colienzyme at 2.4 Å resolution. 2The structure factor amplitudes of the native data set and the refined coordinates of KDO8P synthase have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry 1D9E).The structure provides a wealth of information on the organization of the active site and on the interactions between the enzyme subunits. A reaction very similar to KDO8P synthesis is the formation of 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAH7P) catalyzed by DAH7P synthase (11.De Leo A.B. Sprinson D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This reaction is the first step of the shikimate pathway for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. Analysis of the structural and evolutionary relationships between KDO8P synthase and DAH7P synthase provides additional insight into the mechanism of both enzymes and strongly suggests that the syntheses of both KDO8P and DAH7P proceed through the formation of a linear rather than a cyclic intermediate. The E. coli KDO8P synthase (KDO8PS) is encoded by the kdsAgene (12.Woisetschlager M. Hogenauer G. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 437-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The translated monomeric product contains 284 amino acids with a calculated M r of 30,833. KDO8P synthase was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring thekdsA gene in the plasmid pT7–7 by a modification of the procedure described by Dotson et al. (10.Dotson G.D. Dua R.K. Clemens J.C. Wooten E.W. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13698-13705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ten ml from a small scale growth of the overexpressing strain were transferred to two flasks each containing 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin, and the culture was maintained under shaking at 37 °C until mid-log phase. At this point, expression of KDO8P synthase was induced with 60 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were grown for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and lysed with two passes through a French press. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, and loaded directly onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (200 ml bed volume) equilibrated with 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4). The column was first washed with three volumes of 25 mm potassium phosphate and then eluted with a two volume gradient from 25 to 130 mmpotassium phosphate. Fractions containing active KDO8P synthase were pooled, and solid ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m. The protein solution was then applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (100-ml bed volume) equilibrated with 25 mm potassium phosphate, 0.5 m ammonium sulfate and eluted with a gradient in one column volume from 25 mmpotassium phosphate, 0.5 m ammonium sulfate to 25 mm potassium phosphate. Fractions containing the active enzyme were pooled and concentrated by pressure filtration. The concentrated enzyme (80 mg ml−1) in 25 mmpotassium phosphate was flash frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen in small aliquots until crystallization. Crystallization was performed by vapor diffusion in hanging drops. Cubic crystals (space groupI23, a = 228.6 Å) were obtained from drops containing 400 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1.4m ammonium sulfate, 6% ethylene glycol, 4 mmPEP, 4 mm A5P, and 30 mg ml−1 KDO8PS, equilibrated at 23 °C against 400 mm potassium phosphate, 6% ethylene glycol, and 1.7–1.9 m ammonium sulfate. Crystals were harvested and maintained in a cryo-protectant holding solution containing 400 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2.4 m ammonium sulfate, 6% ethylene glycol, 10% glycerol. KDO8PS activity was determined by measuring the amount of KDO8P produced using the periodate-thiobarbituric acid assay (13.Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (14.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A native data set was collected at 100 K with a Raxis IV image plate detector at the CuKα wavelength. The structure determination of the enzyme employed the anomalous diffraction at multiple wavelengths (MAD) of a mercury derivative (Table I) obtained by soaking crystals for 24 h in a holding solution containing 9 mm mercurochrome (2′,7′-dibromo-4′-[hydroxymercurio]-fluorescein) and sodium sulfate in place of ammonium sulfate. Anomalous diffraction at the absorption edge of mercury and at a remote wavelength were collected at beamline X12C, Brookhaven National Laboratories, with a charge-coupled device detector. Oscillation data were processed with HKL (15.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Three heavy atom sites were identified with SOLVE (16.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Phases were improved and extended stepwise (0.15 Å increments) to 2.4 Å (resolution of the native data set). The model for subunits A and B was fit into the density using O (19.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Subunits C and D were generated by application of the local symmetry. Model refinement was carried out with CNS version 0.5 (20.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice M.

Solvent molecules were added only during the final stages of refinement after the protein model had stabilized. Residues 206–217 (L7) and 246–251 (L8) of subunits A, B, and C, and residues 206–217 and 245–252 of subunit D could not be identified unambiguously and were not included in the final model.

Open table in a new tab Multiple sequence alignments were performed with the program ClustalW (24.Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2878) Google Scholar). Structure superposition and structure-based sequence alignment were carried out using the program LSQMAN (25.Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains a homotetramer of KDO8P synthase (subunits ABCD) with 222 local symmetry (three 2-fold axes intersecting in the tetramer center) (Fig.2); each monomer has the fold of a typical (β/α)8 barrel (eight-stranded parallel β-barrel surrounded by eight helices) as observed in the structure of triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) (26.Banner D.W. Bloomer A.C. Petsko G.A. Phillips D.C. Pogson C.I. Wilson I.A. Corran P.H. Furth A.J. Milman J.D. Offord R.E. Priddle J.D. Waley S.G. Nature. 1975; 255: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The secondary structure elements of the E. coli KDO8P synthase (284 residues) and TIM from various sources (247–250 residues) superimpose well (not shown) with the main differences occurring at the N terminus, where KDO8P synthase has an additional β-hairpin that seals the N-terminal end of the barrel, and at the C terminus, where helix H8 of KDO8P synthase has a random coil extension (Fig. 2). Despite the significant structural kinship between KDO8P synthase and TIM, neither a direct sequence comparison nor a structure based alignment reveals any sequence similarity between the two proteins. Previous biochemical studies indicated that the E. coliKDO8P synthase is a trimer of identical subunits (13.Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the cubic crystals of KDO8P synthase there are no intersubunit contacts along the directions of the crystallographic 3-fold axes that would support a trimeric architecture. A tetramer is also contained in the asymmetric unit of a different crystal form of KDO8P synthase belonging to a monoclinic space group. 3S. Radaev, P. Dastidar, M. Patel, R. W. Woodard, and D. L. Gatti, manuscript in preparation.Together these observations suggest that the tetramer probably represents the native form of the enzyme. The four monomers of KDO8P synthase are very similar with root mean square deviations not exceeding 1.0 Å for all atoms and 0.5 Å for Cα atoms in all pairwise comparisons. The contact surface between subunits A and B (or C and D) is characterized by both polar and hydrophobic interactions occurring primarily between helices H6, H7, and H8 of one subunit and the same helices of the other subunit (Fig. 2). Two loops play a key role in completing the assembly of the tetramer: loop L2 (residues 58–72) of subunit A contacts helices H4 and H5 of subunit C and loop L6 (residues 170–182) of subunit A contacts the same loop of subunit C at the center of the tetramer. Also, the C-terminal coil extension of each subunit extends over helices H7 and H8 of the neighboring subunit (Fig. 2). Because of the 222 symmetry of the tetramer, the interactions described above (A to C) occur again between the same subunits in reverse (C to A) and between the other two subunits (B to D and D to B). An interesting feature of KDO8P synthase crystals is that the three-dimensional lattice is sparsely populated (70% solvent content) with only subunits A, B, and C involved in crystal contacts. This characteristic packing may be responsible for the fact that the temperature factors of subunit D are about 30% higher than those of the other three subunits of the enzyme. Attempts were made to visualize the substrates PEP and A5P by incubating crystals of KDO8P synthase in the presence of a large excess (4 × 104-fold) of either of these compounds over their K m values ( KmPEP = 6 μm; KmA5P = 30 μm; Ref.6.Kohen A. Jakob A. Baasov T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, neither PEP nor A5P were visible under these conditions, probably because of the high ionic strength of the holding solution (2.4 m ammonium sulfate). Attempts to transfer crystals of KDO8P synthase to a low ionic strength holding solution were not successful. Although the active site of KDO8P synthase could not be identified directly, its location could be derived by comparison with the structures of other enzymes that adopt a TIM barrel topology. In these enzymes the active site is always located in a cavity at the C-terminal end of the barrel (27.Babbitt P.C. Gerlt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30591-30594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A similar motif is also observed in KDO8P synthase, where an elongated depression at the interface between subunits opens into a deeper cavity that is likely to represent the active site. Two cavities are visible on each face of the tetramer, one between subunit A and C and one between subunit B and D (Figs. 2 and3 A). Most of the residues of the putative active site are contributed by the C-terminal end of the barrel and by the loops of one subunit (Fig. 3 A, yellow shading) with a small contribution originating from helices H4 and H5, and loops L4 and L5 of another subunit (Fig. 3 A,cyan shading). A sulfate ion (SO4–1), stabilized by salt bridges to the side chains of Lys-138 and Arg-168 and by a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Ala-116, is located in the most recessed part of the active site cavity (Fig. 3 B). The pattern of noncovalent interactions around this ion is very similar to that observed in the structure of yeast enolase from crystals stabilized in ammonium sulfate, in which a sulfate ion is found at the location of the phosphate moiety of PEP (28.Stec B. Lebioda L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because of the high concentration of ammonium sulfate at which the crystals are maintained, it is possible that a sulfate ion also substitutes for PEP in the active site of KDO8P synthase. Additional evidence that the position of SO4–1 represents the binding site of the phosphate moiety of PEP derives from the observation that PEP, but not A5P, protects His-202 (whose Nδ is 4.7 Å from one of the oxygen atoms of SO4–1, Fig.3 B) from chemical modification by diethylpyrocarbonate (29.Sheflyan G.Y. Duewel H.S. Chen G. Woodard R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14320-14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A second sulfate ion (SO4–2) is located approximately 13 Å from SO4–1, in a raised position above the opening of the barrel and beneath the very long L2 loop (residues 58–72) (Fig. 3 B). This sulfate ion is stabilized by a salt bridge to the side chain of Arg-63 and by hydrogen bonds to both the side chain and the backbone of Ser-64. The distance between the aldehyde carbon (C1) and the phosphate moiety of A5P is approximately 7.5 Å, and the distance between C3 and the phosphate group of PEP is approximately 3.5 Å. The sum of these distances (11 Å) matches closely the distance of 13 Å between SO4–1 and SO4–2, which suggests that PEP and A5P may bind with their phosphate moieties occupying the sites of these sulfate ions and with C3PEP in close proximity of C1A5P. The proposed positions of PEP and A5P, with PEP located more deeply in the active site and A5P closer to the opening, are consistent with the observation that the synthesis of KDO8P is an ordered reaction in which the binding of PEP precedes the binding of A5P (6.Kohen A. Jakob A. Baasov T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In subunit B and C only, a third sulfate ion (SO4–3) is bound near the outer rim of the active site cavity, in a region that includes contributions from L1 and H1 (Figs. 2 and 3). This sulfate ion is stabilized by a salt bridge to Arg-31 and possibly by the positive charge of the N-terminal end of helix H1. The fact that only two of four potential SO4–3 sites are occupied, despite equal accessibility of Arg-31 in all four subunits of the enzyme, suggests that the initial binding of sulfate to one face of KDO8P synthase (subunits B and C in Figs. 2 and 3 A) introduces an asymmetry in the tetramer that may affect the binding of sulfate to the other face. The physiological function of the SO4–3 site remains uncertain. However, it is of interest that inorganic phosphate is a noncompetitive inhibitor of theE. coli KDO8P synthase (6.Kohen A. Jakob A. Baasov T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the SO4–3 site identified in the x-ray structure of the enzyme may correspond to the inhibitory phosphate binding site predicted from kinetic measurements. In this context, it is of note that the binding of sulfate at the SO4–3 site of subunit B and C coincides with several small structural changes in the side chains of Asp-32, Arg-36, Glu-245, and Pro-252, which appear to propagate from Arg-31 in the direction of the active site cavity. A reaction similar to KDO8P synthesis constitutes the first step in the metabolic pathway for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. This reaction is the formation of DAH7P from erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) and PEP, which is catalyzed by DAH7P synthase (DAH7PS, EC 4.1.2.15) (11.De Leo A.B. Sprinson D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Bacteria and fungi both express several isoforms of DAH7P synthase that are characterized primarily by differences in their allosteric regulators. Although there is no obvious sequence similarity between the E. coli KDO8P synthase and the three isoforms of the E. coli DAH7P synthase, there is sequence similarity between theE. coli KDO8P synthase and the DAH7P synthases fromChlamydia thrachomatis, Bacillus subtilis (strainMarburg168), and Aeropyrum pernix. A multiple alignment of KDO8P and DAH7P synthase sequences reveals that most of the residues involved in the architecture of the active site (see above) are conserved in both groups of enzymes (Fig.4). In particular, all the residues directly involved in the binding of SO4–1 and SO4–2 are highly conserved, suggesting that the binding modes of PEP and A5P or PEP and E4P in the active sites of these homologous enzymes are similar. In contrast, Arg-31, which is the residue primarily responsible for the stabilization of SO4–3, is present only in a subset of all the sequences, indicating that the SO4–3 site may not be a universal feature of KDO8P and DAH7P synthases. As previously mentioned, analysis of the amino acid sequences of theE. coli KDO8P synthase (284 residues) and of the E. coli isoforms of DAH7P synthase (∼350 residues each) does not reveal any obvious similarities. Furthermore, the E. coliDAH7P synthase isozymes require a metal ion for activity (30.Stephens C.M. Bauerle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20810-20817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas no metals can be detected by atomic absorption or UV-visible spectroscopy in active preparations of the E. coli KDO8P synthase (data not shown) nor is any metal observed in the x-ray structure of the enzyme. These differences might be interpreted as representative of the fact that, although the two enzymes catalyze very similar reactions, they are not evolutionarily related. Surprisingly, the recently reported crystal structure of the E. coliphenylalanine-regulated DAH7P synthase (31.Shumilin I.A. Kretsinger R.H. Bauerle R.H. Structure. 1999; 7: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) shows that both the tertiary and quaternary structures of this enzyme are remarkably similar to those of KDO8P synthase. Like KDO8P synthase, DAH7P synthase is a homotetramer with 222 symmetry. A superposition of the monomers of the E. coli KDO8P and DAH7P synthases is shown in Fig.5. The core structure, represented by the elliptical (β/α)8 barrel (colored in yellowfor KDO8PS and blue for DAH7PS), is almost identical in the two enzymes. However, several important structural features are unique to each protein. The N terminus of DAH7P synthase contains an extension of 50 amino acids that includes one short β-strand and two helices (colored in cyan in Fig. 5). The second of the two helices seals the N-terminal end of the barrel and thus occupies a position corresponding to that of the N-terminal β-hairpin in KDO8P synthase (colored in orange in Fig. 5, see also Fig. 2). The L2 loop, which in KDO8PS is involved in the binding of SO4–2, is substantially longer and convoluted in DAH7PS (colored in green in Fig.5). In DAH7P synthase the connection between helix H5 and strand S6 is provided by a β-hairpin (strands S6a and S6b, colored inpink in Fig. 5) that extends outside of the barrel. This hairpin forms a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with the short N-terminal strand of a neighboring monomer and thus is important for the assembly of the DAH7PS tetramer. Finally, the L8 loop (colored inmagenta in Fig. 5) is longer in DAH7PS than in KDO8PS; however, in both enzymes this loop is partially disordered. A comparison of the binding interactions of ions and substrates in the active sites of KDO8P and DAH7P synthases provides insight into the mechanism and evolution of these enzymes. KDO8PS and DAH7PS adhere almost perfectly to the canonical characteristics of enzymes with a TIM barrel topology (27.Babbitt P.C. Gerlt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30591-30594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Their active site is locate"

Reconstructions were carried out on images obtained from a purified, detergent-solubilized receptor for two different buffer conditions, which were expected to favor open and closed functional states of the channel. As for the heart (RyR2) and skeletal muscle (RyR1) receptor isoforms, RyR3 is a homotetrameric complex comprising two main components, a multidomain cytoplasmic assembly and a smaller (∼20% of the total mass) transmembrane region. Although the isoforms show structural similarities, consistent with the ∼70% overall sequence identity of the isoforms, detailed comparisons of RyR3 with RyR1 showed one region of highly significant difference between them. This difference indicated additional mass present in RyR1, and it likely corresponds to a region of the RyR1 sequence (residues 1303–1406, known as diversity region 2) that is absent from RyR3. The reconstructions of RyR3 determined under “open” and “closed” conditions were similar to each other in overall architecture.

Both RyRs and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors exist as homotetrameric protein complexes composed of an unusually large subunit, ≈560 kDa for RyRs and ≈313 kDa for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. Frequently an ≈12-kDa isoform of FK506-binding protein (FKBP, an immunophilin) binds with sufficient affinity to the receptors so as to co-purify with them, and the immunophilin may therefore be considered as a component of the receptors (10.Wagenknecht T.

Recent studies have shown that the receptors are much more widely expressed than is indicated by the nomenclature (13.Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 14.Conti A. Gorza L. Sorrentino V. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15.Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). For instance, all three isoforms are expressed in brain, but with distributions unique to each. RyR3, the subject of this study, is present at low levels in a variety of excitable and nonexcitable cells, the richest source being diaphragm muscle where it is co-expressed at about 2.5% of the level of RyR1 (16.Jeyakumar L.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16011-16020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).RyR1 and RyR2 are sufficiently enriched in skeletal and heart muscle, respectively, to have allowed their purification in sufficient quantities for biochemical and biophysical characterization (17.Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15637-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol.

RyR1 and RyR2 are key components of the multicomponent complexes that are responsible for excitation-contraction coupling in striated muscle (6.Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol.

Our understanding of RyR3 has lagged behind that of the other isoforms because of difficulty in isolating sufficient quantities, and only recently have protocols been developed that allow commencement of its characterization (16.Jeyakumar L.H.

These studies have shown that RyR3 has similar, but not identical, conductance and pharmacological properties to those found for the other isoforms. For example, RyR3 is activated by Ca2+ (micromolar) and by millimolar ATP and is inhibited by millimolar Mg2+ and by Ca2+ above millimolar levels. All of the isoforms bind with high affinity the plant alkaloid, ryanodine, which locks the receptors into similar subconductance states. As isolated, RyR1 and RyR2 contain FKBP12 and FKBP12.6, respectively. RyR1 and RyR3 are capable of binding both FKBP isoforms, whereas RyR2 binds only FKBP12.6. Purified RyR2 and RyR3 differ from RyR1 by their lack of modulation of channel activity by FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 (12.Copello J.A. Jeyakumar L. Fleischer S. Biophys.

Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These hypervariable regions are thought to partially account for the functional differences among the isoforms. Indeed, two of these regions, termed D2 (residues 1303–1406 of RyR1) and D3 (residues 1872–1923), seem to be involved in establishing the properties of excitation-contraction coupling that are characteristic of skeletal muscle vis-à-viscardiac muscle (30.Nakai J.

Here we describe the first such reconstructions of RyR3, obtained under conditions that favor two different structural configurations of the receptor. Comparisons with previous reconstructions of the other two isoforms show that all three have a highly conserved three-dimensional organization in which about 80% of the protein mass forms a cytoplasmic assembly containing at least 10 distinguishable domains. One significant difference in morphology between RyR3 and RyR1 has been detected, and it likely corresponds to one of the regions of the sequence, the D2 region, that is hypervariable among the isoforms and is missing.DISCUSSIONThree-dimensional reconstructions of the RyR3 isoform in two different configurational states have been determined.

Evidence that strongly suggests that solubilized receptors do indeed mimic reconstituted receptors when exposed to modulatory ligands comes from ryanodine binding experiments, which have been done using solubilized RyR3. Ryanodine is known to preferentially bind to the open form of the receptor over the closed form (41.Chu A. Diaz-Muñoz M. Hawkes M.J. Brush K. Hamilton S.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar), and for solubilized RyR3, ryanodine binding is modulated by known receptor activators and inhibitors in much the same manner as channel gating in bilayer experiments (19.Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,22.Murayama T. Oba T. Katayama E. Oyamada H. Oguchi K. Kobayashi M. Otsuka K. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17297-17308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).It is reassuring that many of the differences that we found between the reconstructions of open and closed RyR3 are similar to changes described recently by another laboratory for closed and open RyR1 (40.Orlova E.V. Serysheva I.I. van Heel M. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,42.Serysheva I.I. Schatz M. van Heel M. Chiu W. Hamilton S.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1936-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The differences between open and closed RyR3 that are similar to those reported for RyR1 include the following.Transmembrane AssemblyFor RyR3 we found a 4° rotation of the transmembrane assembly in the open relative to the closed state when viewed from the SR junctional face (Fig. 3 (middle panels) and Fig. 4 A (left panel)). For RyR1, a rotation of the same magnitude and handedness was seen for the ryanodine-induced state (40.Orlova E.V. Serysheva I.I. van Heel M. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) but not when natural activators (nucleotide and Ca2+) were used. We suggest that this rotation, as well as the apparent expansion in the overall size of the transmembrane region that we find for the open form of RyR3 (Fig. 3), should not be interpreted literally, rather, they result from underlying changes in the relative orientations of the transmembrane domains that are contributed by each of the four receptor subunits. At the limited resolution of the current three-dimensional reconstructions, these structural rearrangements themselves are not resolved but may still manifest themselves as visible changes, such as apparent rotations or changes in shape of the transmembrane region. Support for this interpretation is presented in Fig. 4 B (and for RyR1 in the study by Serysheva et al. (42.Serysheva I.I. Schatz M. van Heel M. Chiu W. Hamilton S.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1936-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) in which a high density threshold has been used to display the reconstructions of open and closed receptors. There it appears that the four transmembrane domains change their orientation with respect to the symmetry axis of the receptor so that regions at the distal end of the transmembrane assembly move away from the symmetry axis, perhaps thereby creating a pathway for ions to travel when the receptor is in its native environment. A similar, but not identical, interpretation has been described for RyR1 (42.Serysheva I.I. Schatz M. van Heel M. Chiu W. Hamilton S.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1936-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Cytoplasmic AssemblyFor RyR1 a pronounced weakening or separation of the apparent connection between domains 9 and 10 in the clamp assemblies that form the corners of the cytoplasmic assembly was observed (40.Orlova E.V. Serysheva I.I. van Heel M. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 42.Serysheva I.I. Schatz M. van Heel M. Chiu W. Hamilton S.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1936-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For RyR3 we do not observe a distinct separation of these domains, although there is a slight weakening, of uncertain significance, of the connection between them (cf. left panels of Figs. 3, a and b, and 5). Perhaps this difference between the isoforms is related to the unique role that RyR1 plays in excitation-contraction coupling in mature skeletal muscle. In situ, RyR1 is thought to interact with the voltage sensing dihydropyridine receptors via the clamp regions of its cytoplasmic assembly (discussed in the following section), but RyR3 apparently cannot undergo this interaction.Another change in the clamp regions of the cytoplasmic assembly is in the disposition of domain 6, which makes the cytoplasmic assembly appear somewhat thicker in the direction parallel to the 4-fold symmetry axis (Fig. 3, right panels) and reduces the apparent separation between domains 5 and 6 when the receptor is viewed onto the cytoplasmic face (cf. Fig. 3, left panels). Again, quite similar changes were reported for RyR1.The remarkable similarities of RyR1 and RyR3 with regard to structural changes associated with the open and closed conditions are strong evidence that these changes are not artifactual and that they indeed correspond to authentic perturbations of the structure associated with receptor gating. An intriguing aspect of the structural differences between the open and closed states of both RyR1 and RyR3 is their global nature. The changes associated with the clamp assemblies are over 100 Å from the likely location of the channel gating mechanism in the transmembrane assembly. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that proteins that are known to modulate channel gating of RyR1 (calmodulin, FK506-binding protein, and imperatoxin A) also bind far from the transmembrane region (10.Wagenknecht T. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Xin H.-B. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32463-32471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 43.Samso M. Trujillo R. Gurrola G.B. Valdivia H.H. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, very long range structural rearrangements, presumably underlying allosteric communication between functional sites, seem to be a general feature of ryanodine receptors.Comparison of RyR3 and RyR1 Three-dimensional ArchitectureOverall RyR3 and RyR1 are nearly identical in structure at the resolutions attained in the three-dimensional reconstructions reported thus far. Analysis of the sequences has shown that one of the three hypervariable regions, named D2 (residues 1303–1406 in RyR1) by Sorrentino and Volpe (29.Sorrentino V. Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), is completely absent from the RyR3 sequence. A deletion of this magnitude should be easily detectable in a comparison of the RyR1 and RyR3 reconstructions, assuming that in RyR1 the D2 region forms a rigid, globular fold and that other perturbations of the surrounding structure are minimal. Indeed, when we compared the structures of RyR1 and RyR3, which were determined under similar solution conditions and with identical methodology, a single region of excess mass present in RyR1 dominated all other differences (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the overall size of the region (≈35 × 20 Å) was reasonable for a segment containing ≈100 amino acid residues. The region is located in domain 6 along each of the exterior edges of the receptor.Further support for our proposal that the major difference between the reconstructions of RyR1 and RyR3 represents the D2 region comes from the immuno-electron microscopy study by Murayama et al.(22.Murayama T. Oba T. Katayama E. Oyamada H. Oguchi K. Kobayashi M. Otsuka K. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17297-17308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), who visualized immunocomplexes of RyR1 and a D2-specific antibody in negative stain. They observed the antibody bound to the clamp regions of the receptor, in agreement with our interpretation of the major difference between the RyR1 and RyR3 reconstructions. Furthermore, we have analyzed the images described by Murayama et al. (22.Murayama T. Oba T. Katayama E. Oyamada H. Oguchi K. Kobayashi M. Otsuka K. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17297-17308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) in our own laboratory by digitizing them and then applying limited image averaging to them (data not shown), and we conclude that the D2-specific antibodies are bound along the edges of the receptor in the vicinity of domain 6, as we would predict based upon the findings described here. However, a three-dimensional reconstruction of immunocomplexes containing a D2-specific antibody is required to prove that the binding site corresponds exactly to the region that we contend contains the D2 region, and we are currently working toward this goal.The D2 region is currently of interest because of its perceived importance in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal and cardiac muscle (27.Tarroni P. Rossi D. Conti A. Sorrentino V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19808-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A region nearby in the sequence involving residues 1076–1122 appears also to be important and to play a role in the interaction of RyR1 with the voltage sensors/dihydropyridine receptors (32.Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33.Leong P. MacLennan D.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 76: 681-694Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 44.Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29958-29964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Based largely upon freeze-fracture studies of skeletal muscle sarcolemma/transverse tubules and SR, Franzini-Armstrong and co-workers (46.Franzini-Armstrong C. Jorgensen A.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 509-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) have proposed a structural model for the triad junction, regions where the transverse tubules and SR form junctions to carry out excitation-contraction coupling. In this model the dihydropyridine receptors are arranged in groups of four (tetrads), which appear to be in register with the tetrameric RyR1 s in the opposing junctional SR (6.Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 45.Block B.A. Imagawa T. Campbell K.P. Franzini-Armstrong C. J.

A. 1996; 93: 8101-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it appears that each dihydropyridine receptor within a tetrad would interact with one of the clamp assemblies in the adjoining RyR1 (39.Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvilli I.S. Grassucci R.A. Jünemann R. Burkhardt N. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 48.Wagenknecht T. Radermacher M.

Thus, the location that we have assigned to the D2 region in the three-dimensional structure of RyR appears to be consistent with current models of the triad junction's architecture.In conclusion, we have established that RyR3 is amenable to study by three-dimensional cryo-microscopy, and that RyR3, although similar in its overall three-dimensional architecture to the other RyR isoforms, does reveal at least one significant difference that is attributed provisionally to the D2 region of the amino acid sequence of the receptor. We also observed several structural differences at diverse locations between two conformational states of RyR3 that likely correspond to, or are related to, open and closed states of the receptor. Future studies at higher resolution will certainly resolve additional structural differences between the isoforms and clarify the structural basis of channel gating. Intracellular calcium is essential for the regulation and function of many fundamental biological processes, and the release of calcium from intracellular storage compartments plays an essential role in modulating cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels (1.Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Ryanodine receptors (RyRs)1 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are the two families of intracellular calcium release channels that have been characterized to date (reviewed in Refs. 2.Fleischer S.

Both RyRs and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors exist as homotetrameric protein complexes composed of an unusually large subunit, ≈560 kDa for RyRs and ≈313 kDa for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. Frequently an ≈12-kDa isoform of FK506-binding protein (FKBP, an immunophilin) binds with sufficient affinity to the receptors so as to co-purify with them, and the immunophilin may therefore be considered as a component of the receptors (10.Wagenknecht T.

https://openalex.org/W2015492975,"Induction of apoptosis in a variety of cell types leads to inhibition of protein synthesis. Recently, the cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) by caspase 3 was described as a possible event contributing to translation inhibition. Here, we report the cleavage of another initiation factor in apoptotic cells, eIF2α, that could contribute to regulation of translation during apoptosis. This cleavage event could be completely inhibited by pretreatment of HeLa cells with Z-VAD-fmk. In vitroanalysis using purified eIF2 and purified caspases showed cleavage of eIF2α by caspase 3, 6, 8, and 10 but not 9. Caspase 3 most efficiently cleaved eIF2α and this could be inhibited by addition of Ac-DEVD-CHO in vitro. Comparison of cleavage of phosphorylated versus nonphosphorylated eIF2α revealed a modest preference of the caspases for the nonphosphorylated form. When eIF2·2B complex was used as substrate, only caspase 3 was capable of eIF2α cleavage, which was not affected by phosphorylation of the α subunit. The eIF2·GDP binary complex was cleaved much less efficiently by caspase 3. Sequence analysis of the cleavage fragment suggested that the cleavage site is located in the C-terminal portion of the protein. Analysis showed that after caspase cleavage, exchange of GDP bound to eIF2 was very rapid and no longer dependent upon eIF2B. Furthermore, in vitro translation experiments indicated that cleavage of eIF2α results in functional alteration of the eIF2 complex, which no longer stimulated upstream AUG selection on a mRNA containing a viral internal ribosome entry site and was no longer capable of stimulating overall translation. In conclusion, we describe here the cleavage of a translation initiation factor, eIF2α that could contribute to inhibition or alteration of protein synthesis during the late stages of apoptosis.

The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2)1 plays a key role in the initiation of translation. eIF2 is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of three subunits α, β, and γ, which forms a so-called ternary complex with GTP and the initiator Met-tRNA. The ternary complex interacts with the 40 S ribosomal subunit thereby forming a 43 S preinitiation complex that is capable of recognizing the proper start codon of the mRNA. It has been shown in yeast that eIF2 itself is involved in this process of start codon selection (1.Donahue T.F. Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Valavicius B.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) indicating its importance in translation initiation. Upon joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 43 S preinitiation complex, the GTP moiety is hydrolyzed and an eIF2·GDP complex is released from the ribosome (2.Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Participation of the eIF2·GDP complex in a new round of translation requires the exchange of the GDP moiety for a new GTP molecule, a process carried out by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. The global rate of protein synthesis in eukaryotes is mainly regulated by the specific phosphorylation of Ser-51 of the eIF2α subunit. eIF2α is known to be phosphorylated by kinases such as PKR (double-stranded RNA dependent eIF2 kinase) in response to viral infection, and stress conditions (3.Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G.

Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated eIF2 binds eIF2B tightly, forming a poorly dissociable eIF2(αP)·eIF2B complex. Since eIF2B exists in relatively low molar quantities with respect to eIF2 in the cytoplasm in many systems, phosphorylation of as little as 25% of eIF2α can be sufficient to sequester virtually all the available eIF2B, thereby blocking the eIF2B catalyzed recycling of the eIF2·GDP and subsequently inhibiting protein synthesis completely (8.Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). It has been well established that protein synthesis is inhibited during apoptosis or programmed cell death but the mechanism of translation inhibition has remained unclear until recently. We and others have recently shown that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI), which is required for binding of capped mRNA to ribosomal 43 S subunits, was cleaved by caspase 3 during apoptosis (9.Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7565-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10.Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Morley S.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Similar cleavage of eIF4GI is one of the major causes of translation inhibition during enterovirus infection of cells (11.Etchison D. Hansen J. Ehrenfeld E. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Milburn S. Hershey J.W.B. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 832-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the cleavage of eIF4GI correlates with the observed inhibition of protein synthesis in apoptotic cells (9.Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7565-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Other reports indicate that phosphorylation of eIF2α could represent another mechanism by which translation is inhibited during apoptosis. For instance, overexpression of PKR in transfected cells resulted in elevated levels of phosphorylated eIF2α concomitant with reduced protein synthesis and induction of apoptosis in these cells (12.Srivastava S.P. Kumar K.U. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2416-2423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that PKR is a tumor suppressor protein as it was shown that overexpression of mutant PKR incapable of phosphorylating eIF2α resulted in tumor formation (13.Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 14.Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Similarly, others have described that lowering the level of the eIF2 associated protein, p67, resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated eIF2α concomitant with induction of apoptosis in these cells (15.Datta B. Datta R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In both cases, the decrease in the overall rate of protein synthesis was ascribed to the phosphorylation of eIF2α. Here, we report the cleavage of eIF2α by caspase 3 during the late stages of the execution phase of apoptosis in HeLa cells, K562 cells, and Jurkat T cells. The cleavage of the 38-kDa α subunit resulted into a 36-kDa cleavage product as observed by both Coomassie stain and immunoblot analysis. In vitro experiments using purified eIF2 and purified caspases showed that eIF2α could be a substrate for caspases 3, 6, 9, and 10 but not caspase 8. Although cleavage by caspase 3 appeared to be most efficient we do not rule out the possibility that other caspases might be responsible for eIF2α cleavage in vivo. In vitro experiments using both nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated eIF2α as a substrate showed that all caspases had a preference for the nonphosphorylated form of eIF2α. Interestingly, when eIF2·2B complex was used as substrate no preference was observed between nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated eIF2α. The cleavage site appears to be located in the C-terminal region of the protein as determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the 36-kDa cleavage product. Close examination of this region revealed two putative caspase 3 cleavage sites which would lead to the release of a 14- or 11-amino acid peptide. Interestingly, results indicate that cleavage of eIF2α does inactivate the eIF2 complex as determined by in vitro translation assays. HeLa S3 cells were grown as described (9.Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7565-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). K562 cells were grown at 37 °C in RPMI (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 0.5% fetal calf serum (Summit Biotechnology), 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (Sigma) in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2. For induction of apoptosis, stock solutions of cisplatin, etoposide, cycloheximide (Sigma), or TNF-α (Peprotech) were diluted with medium and then incubated with cells at 37 °C for the time indicated in each figure. Cell extracts were prepared as described (9.Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7565-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in CHAPS lysis buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.2, 0.1 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% CHAPS, 10% sucrose) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Detection of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage was accomplished by immunoblotting with a mouse monoclonal anti-PARP antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Detection of eIF4GI cleavage was performed by immunoblot as described previously (9.Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7565-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).

The eIF2 used for the guanine nucleotide exchange studies was purified from rabbit reticulocyte post-ribosomal supernatant as described (19.Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNAs encoding human caspase 3, 6, 9, and the cDNAs encoding caspase 8 (Ser-217 to Asp-479) and caspase 10 (Ile-162 to Ile-479) cloned into pET15b (caspase 8), pET21b (caspases 6, 9, and 10), and pET23b (caspase 3) (all Novagen) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Caspases 3 and 8 were a kind gift of Dr. Claudius Vincenz; caspases 6, 9, and 10 were a kind gift of Dr. Emad Alnemri. The expressed proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Working concentrations of active caspases were standardized based on in vitro colorimetric cleavage assays using appropriate substrate peptides coupled topara-nitroanilide (pNA) (9.Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7565-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Caspase activity units are defined as the amount of caspase required to hydrolyze 1 nmol of pNA substrate/min. Various caspases were used at concentrations ranging from 10 to 60 μg/ml as determined appropriate by these assays. Purified rabbit eIF2 (1 μl) was incubated at 37 °C with purified recombinant caspase 3 (1 μl) in a total volume of 10 μl for the time points indicated in each figure. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a mouse monoclonal antiserum specific for eIF2α (20.Scorsone K.A. Panniers R. Rowlands A.G. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase 3-treated eIF2 for in vitro translation assays was prepared similarly as described above with the following modification: after incubation at 37 °C for 8 h, caspase 3 was inactivated by the addition of the caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (10 μm) (Quality Controlled Biochemicals) for 1 h at 37 °C and subsequently stored at −80 °C. Purified rabbit eIF2 (10 μl) or eIF2·2B (1 μl) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with HRI (2 μl) in buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP (final volume 30 μl). Three microliters of phosphorylated eIF2 or eIF2·2B was then used in cleavage assays as described above in a final reaction volume of 30 μl. To saturate eIF2 with GDP for cleavage studies, eIF2 (1 μl) was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 30 μmGDP. To “freeze” the GDP on the eIF2 and stabilize the conformation of eIF2, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. For each 20-μl aliquot of guanine nucleotide exchange assay mixture, ∼1.5 pmol of eIF2 was incubated in the presence or absence of 18 units of caspase 3 (Upstate Biotechnology) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% polyethylene glycol for 3 h at 37 °C. [3H]GDP (5 μm) was then added and after 10 min of additional incubation, 3 mm Mg(OAc)2 was added to stabilize the eIF2·lsqb]3H]GDP complex. After a further 5-min incubation, 100 μm unlabeled GDP was added and the amount of eIF2·[3H]GDP complex remaining was determined after various times of incubation by filtration of a 20-μl aliquot of each assay mixture through nitrocellulose filters as described previously (17.Matts R.L. Levin D.H. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine the phosphorylation status of eIF2α in vivo, 5 × 106 cells from apoptotic or control cultures were taken and resuspended in 200 μl of VSIEF buffer (9.5 m urea, 5% CHAPS, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5% β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were then clarified and subjected to isoelectric focusing on vertical isoelectric focusing gels by a slight modification of the method of Maurides et al. (21.Maurides P.A. Akkaraju G.R. Jagus R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as described previously (22.Benton P.A. Barrett D.J. Matts R.L. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5525-5532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T7TS plasmid (gift of P. A. Krieg) contains a multiple cloning site upstream of the Xenopusβ-globin 3′-UTR and a track of 30 adenosyl residues which allows generation of poly(A) mRNAs. The region encoding the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) coupled to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) as described (23.Thomas A.A.M. Rijnbrand R. Voorma H.O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) was excised from FMDV-CAT with EcoRV andBamHI and subsequently cloned into blunt-endedHindIII-BglII-digested pT7TS plasmid to generate pT7TSFMDVCAT. pT7TSglobinCAT was generated by insertion of aHindIII-SmaI globin-CAT fragment into aHindIII-EcoRV-digested pT7TS plasmid. Plasmid DNAs were linearized with XbaI, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, and concentrated by alcohol precipitation for use in transcription reactions (see below). Transcription reactions for FMDV-CAT using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) were carried out according to manufacturer's recommendations. For capped globin-CAT, transcription was performed using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit from Ambion. In both cases, the resulting RNAs were purified using spin columns (Eppendorf-5 Prime). Translation reactions were performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations in a 20-μl reaction volume. Addition of buffer control, caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO, eIF2, caspase 3-treated eIF2 plus Ac-DEVD-CHO were added (2 μl) to the translation reaction prior to the addition of [35S]methionine (ICN), and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. After addition of the label, reactions were incubated for another 90 min at 30 °C. Samples (2 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. In addition, translation products were quantified by densitometry (Storm 860 PhosphorImager) or scanning autoradiographs and densitometry using NIH Image. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel. In order to identify possible target proteins that could contribute to translation inhibition during cell death, apoptosis was induced in multiple cell lines using a variety of apoptosis-inducing agents. We started with a system in which we have previously extensively characterized cleavage of eIF4GI (9.Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7565-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) to determine if other factors are also modified. Thus, HeLa cells were treated with 100 μm cisplatin and aliquots were harvested over a 24-h time period as indicated (Fig.1 A). Fig. 1 A shows the eIF2α protein at 0 h with a molecular mass of approximately 38 kDa, at which time cisplatin (100 μm) was added to the HeLa cell culture. Subsequent lanes show that cisplatin treatment of HeLa cells led to cleavage of eIF2α starting between 6 and 7 h post-induction, neared completion at 24 h and generated a cleavage fragment of about 36 kDa in size. The cleavage of eIF2α appears to initiate later than cleavage of the well defined caspase 3 substrate PARP as shown in Fig. 1 B and eIF4GI as shown in Fig.1 C. Generation of the characteristic 85-kDa caspase 3-derived PARP cleavage product and eIF4GI cleavage products can be detected as early as 4 h post-induction. We noted that the eIF2α cleavage fragment is barely detectable at 24 h post-induction. Two factors are likely to contribute to the poor detection of the eIF2α cleavage product: (i) we have noted that the anti-eIF2α monoclonal antibody has a lower affinity for the cleavage fragment of eIF2α as compared with intact eIF2α; and (ii) the stability of the cleaved eIF2α subunit appears to be lower than the intact protein in vivo. In addition, treatment of HeLa cells with etoposide, cycloheximide, or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), K562 cells with cisplatin, etoposide, cycloheximide, or MG132, or Jurkat T cells with cisplatin, etoposide, cycloheximide, MG123, or TNF-α all resulted in the generation of a similar 36-kDa cleavage product (data not shown), indicating that this type of response can be generated in a wide variety of cell types using different inducers of apoptosis. The loss of approximately 2 kDa in molecular mass implies that only a small portion of either the N or C terminus of eIF2α is removed, which raises the question whether this cleavage event results in inactivation of the eIF2 protein complex and could contribute to inhibition of protein synthesis or may modulate eIF2 activity in another way. Therefore, we further examined whether the cleavage of eIF2α correlated with translation inhibition in apoptotic cells. Cisplatin-treated HeLa cells were pulse labeled at the time points indicated for 30 min, subsequently lysed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig.1 D shows that between 3 and 5 h post-induction the incorporation of [35S]methionine into protein decreased significantly, followed by an abrupt further decline to near zero between 6 and 7 h. Much of this translation decrease is likely due to rapid cleavage of eIF4GI or other factors, however, the latter abrupt decline may correlate with the appearance of eIF2α cleavage products. Cisplatin treatment of HeLa cells produces apoptosis, eIF4GI cleavage, and translation shutoff faster than most other inducer/cell combinations we have tested. Thus, in order to reveal possible correlations between eIF2α cleavage and translation shutoff, we explored other apoptotic systems in which eIF4GI cleavage was not so rapid. Fig. 2 summarizes data taken from HeLa cells or K562 erythroblastoid cells treated with etoposide and compares those to data taken from cisplatin-treated HeLa cells. Etoposide treatment of HeLa or K562 cells resulted in slower induction of apoptosis and eIF4GI cleavage, yet the kinetics of cleavage of eIF2α were nearly equivalent. In both cases, translation rates declined as cleavage of eIF2α proceeded. In particular, 80% of eIF4GI was still intact in K562 cells after 16 h treatment, yet translation rates had declined to 50%. Since studies with poliovirus-infected cells have shown that translation rates can still proceed at near 100% efficiency when up to 80–90% of eIF4GI has been cleaved (24.Benton P.A. Murphy J.W. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1995; 213: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), this implies that additional events are occurring in apoptosis to inhibit translation. At this same 16-h time point, eIF2α was 32% cleaved, suggesting a possible contribution to the translation inhibition phenotype. Interestingly, by 24 h, translation was still occurring in etoposide-treated cells even though 70–80% of eIF2α had been processed. This may reflect the observation (see Fig.9 below) that eIF2 complex containing cleaved eIF2α rapidly exchanges GDP, unlike its unprocessed precursor. Despite testing several combinations of cell types and apoptosis inducers, we have not discovered conditions where eIF2α cleavage precedes or occurs independently of eIF4GI cleavage. In summary, these data reveal that cleavage of eIF4GI and eIF2α often occur simultaneously, cleavage rates are variable depending upon the apoptosis inducer and cell type used, and that the mechanism of translation inhibition may be multifactorial, involving simultaneous modification of more than one translation factor.Figure 9Effect of cleavage on the exchange of eIF2-bound [3H]GDP. Assay mixtures containing purified eIF2 were incubated in the presence (open squares) or absence (open circles) of caspase 3 for 3 h at 37 °C under the conditions described for cleavage of eIF2 for guanine nucleotide exchange assays under “Experimental Procedures.” Cleaved and uncleaved eIF2 were bound to [3H]GDP, and eIF2·[3H]GDP complexes were stabilized by the addition of Mg(OAc)2. The amount of [3H]GDP bound to cleaved and uncleaved eIF2 was determined by binding to nitrocellulose filters (0 min), followed by the addition of excess unlabeled GDP. The % [3H]GDP chased from eIF2·[3H]GDP complexes was determined at 7.5 and 15 min by binding of the complex to nitrocellulose filters as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore whether caspase activation is required for the cleavage of eIF2α, we performed in vivo inhibition experiments using the broad spectrum cell-permeable caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Cell cultures were preincubated with 75 μm Z-VAD-fmk, followed by treatment with apoptosis inducers for 16 h. Analysis of cell lysates by immunoblot (Fig. 3 A) show that eIF2α cleavage was completely inhibited in HeLa cells pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk regardless of the inducing agent used. The observed inhibition of cleavage was concomitant with a reduction in overall caspase activation as measured by the decrease in release of pNA from the caspase substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA (Fig. 3 B). The DEVD-pNA cleavage activity in cell lysates pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk was reduced by more than 70% for each inducer tested. These results suggest that the cleavage of eIF2α is caspase-dependent and indicate that caspases could be directly involved in the induction or catalysis of eIF2α cleavage. To identify caspases that could be responsible for the observed eIF2α cleavage in vivo, we screened a panel of purified recombinant human caspases for their ability to cleave eIF2α in vitro. All purified caspases were pre-standardized for equivalent levels of enzymatic activity before incubation with protein substrates. Fig.4 A shows cleavage of eIF2α occurred when HeLa cell ribosomal salt wash (crude initiation factor preparation containing eIF2) was incubated with caspase 3 and 6, and to a lesser extent with caspase 8 and 10, but not with caspase 9. Comparison of these results with in vivo studies shown in Figs. 1 and 3 reveals that the caspases generate an identical eIF2α cleavage fragment, further supporting our hypothesis that caspases are indeed responsible for eIF2α cleavage. In this experiment caspases 3, 6, or 10 could indirectly induce eIF2α cleavage via activation of other proteases present in the HeLa ribosomal salt wash, which subsequently could use eIF2α as a substrate. To address this question, we incubated highly purified rabbit eIF2 with purified caspases to see if the observed cleavage in Fig. 4 A could be generated directly by caspases. Purified eIF2α was cleaved by caspase 3 (Fig. 4 B) whereas incubation with caspase 6, 8, and 10 resulted in only minor or undetectable cleavage of eIF2α. These results might indicate that cleavage of eIF2α by caspases 6 and 10 inpanel A could have been enhanced by activation of other caspases (e.g. caspase 3) in the lysate. Levels of cleavage obtained with caspase 3 over several experiments were significantly greater than the low, somewhat variable cleavage obtained with other caspases, implying that eIF2α is a better substrate for caspase 3 than caspases 6 and 10. However, it is possible that purified eIF2 might not be an appropriate substrate for caspases 6 and 10, which instead may function as a more efficient substrate when it is bound within a higher order translation complex or require other unknown cofactors for efficient cleavage of eIF2α. Furthermore, in this initial experiment, low amounts (2 units) of caspase units were used to cleave eIF2α, which also may explain the low level of eIF2α cleavage. However, further experiments, in which higher levels (17 units) of caspases were used in cleavage assays, indicated that the amount of cleavage increased greatly only with caspase 3 but not with the other caspases tested (see Fig. 7 below). Overall, these results indicate that eIF2α can serve as a substrate for caspases and is cleaved by the effector caspase 3 more efficiently than initiator caspases (caspases 8, 9, and 10).Figure 7Comparison of cleavage of nonphosphorylatedversus phosphorylated eIF2α by caspases.

https://openalex.org/W2136970073,"Many flavoproteins are non-covalent complexes between FMN and an apoprotein. To understand better the stability of flavoproteins, we have studied the energetics of the complex between FMN and the apoflavodoxin from Anabaena PCC 7119 by a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, titration calorimetry, equilibrium binding constant determinations, and x-ray crystallography. Comparison of the strength of the wild type and mutant apoflavodoxin-FMN complexes and that of the complexes between wild type apoflavodoxin and shortened FMN analogues (riboflavin and lumiflavin) allows the dissection of the binding energy into contributions associated with the different parts of the FMN molecule. The estimated contribution of the phosphate is greatest, at 7 kcal mol(-1); that of the isoalloxazine is of around 5-6 kcal mol(-1) (mainly due to interaction with Trp-57 and Tyr-94 in the apoprotein) and the ribityl contributes least: around 1 kcal mol(-1). The stabilization of the complex is both enthalpic and entropic although the enthalpy contribution is dominant. Both the phosphate and the isoalloxazine significantly contribute to the enthalpy of binding. The ionic strength does not have a large effect on the stability of the FMN complex because, although it weakens the phosphate interactions, it strengthens the isoalloxazine-protein hydrophobic interactions. Phosphate up to 100 mM does not affect the strength of the riboflavin complex, which suggests the isoalloxazine and phosphate binding sites may be independent in terms of binding energy. Interestingly, we find crystallographic evidence of flexibility in one of the loops (57-62) involved in isoalloxazine binding."

Overexpression of c-Cbl also reduced the receptor half-life, but only if the receptor was able to engage SFKs. In cultured cells, prolonging the half-life of the receptor correlated with enhanced signaling and more efficient S phase entry, whereas accelerating receptor degradation had the opposite effect. Consistent with these tissue culture findings, there was a statistically significant increase in the onset of a proliferative retinal disease when animals were injected with cells expressing the F72/74 receptor, as compared with cells expressing the WT receptor. Our findings suggest that SFKs cooperate with c-Cbl to negatively regulate the αPDGFR, and that the SFK/c-Cbl suppression of αPDGFR output is relevant to the onset and progression of a proliferative disease.

Signaling via PDGFRs plays a critical role in development, as well as in physiological repair mechanisms and in the pathogenesis of proliferative diseases (1.Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 2.Raines E.W. Ross R. Westermark B. Sorg C.

Growth Factors. 1999; 16: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Two related PDGFR subtypes, termed α and β, have been identified, and the two PDGFRs differ from one another in both their signaling mechanisms and biological functions (3.Rosenkranz S. Kazlauskas A. Growth Factors. 1999; 16: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to PDGF induces dimerization of PDGFRs, and the various PDGF isoforms (PDGF-AA, -AB, and -BB) differ in their ability to associate with the two PDGFRs. PDGF-BB is the universal ligand, and it assembles αα- and ββ-homodimers, as well as αβ-heterodimers, whereas PDGF-AA will assemble only αα-homodimers (4.Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-113PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor dimerization leads to activation and phosphorylation of the αPDGFR, and the phosphorylated receptor is able to associate with a number of SH2-containing proteins. One class of such proteins is the Src family tyrosine kinases (SFK), and they associate with the αPDGFR once tyrosine 572 and/or 574 are phosphorylated (5.Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6.Hooshmand-Rad R. Yokote K. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 607-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to an increase in SFK kinase activity, however, PDGF-dependent cell cycle progression and growth in soft agar are not compromised in cells expressing the αPDGFR mutant which does not bind or activate SFKs (5.Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6.Hooshmand-Rad R. Yokote K. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 607-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that αPDGFR-dependent DNA synthesis does not require an increase in SFK activity at the start of the cell cycle. So why are SFKs engaged when a cell is exposed to PDGF? One possibility is that SFKs contribute to phosphorylation of cellular proteins, which regulate PDGF-dependent responses. For instance, we have found that a receptor mutant that fails to bind or activate SFKs is also unable to mediate efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of the proteins that are phosphorylated in a PDGF-stimulated cell (5.Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,7.DeMali K. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the early activation of SFKs, or their association with the αPDGFR may be required to engage responses that are dependent on the phosphorylation of cellular proteins. c-Cbl is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to a variety of agonists, and hence appears to contribute to many different types of signaling systems (8.Smit L.

The ability of c-Cbl to promote clearing of receptors from the cell surface is at least one mechanism by which c-Cbl negatively regulates growth factor-dependent responses. A growing body of literature indicates that PDGFRs play a non-trivial role in the pathogenesis of a variety of proliferative diseases, such as tumorigenesis, atherosclerosis, and fibrosis. While important advances have been made in elucidating the signaling pathways downstream of each of the PDGFRs, this information is not readily translated to the in vivo disease state. This is in part because these diseases are complex, often involve both of the PDGFRs, and hence it is difficult to evaluate the relative importance of the α and βPDGFR subtypes during disease progression. We have recently identified the αPDGFR as a key contributor to a proliferative retinal disease, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) (19.Andrews A. Balciunaite E. Leong F.L. Tallquist M. Soriano P. Refojo M. Kazlauskas A. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2683-2689PubMed Google Scholar). This model provides a valuable approach to study the importance of signal relay mechanisms for disease progression in vivo. In this study we have tested the hypothesis that SFKs act through c-Cbl to decrease the half-life of the αPDGFR. We also tested the consequences of altered receptor half-life on PDGF-dependent signaling and DNA synthesis. Finally, the relevance of these in vitro findings was tested in anin vivo model of a proliferative disease. The mouse embryo 3T3 Patch B (Ph) cell line was derived from Ph/Ph mouse embryos and was kindly provided by Dr. Dan Bowen-Pope (48.Seifert R.A. van Koppen A. Bowen-Pope D.F. J. Biol.

Ph cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DME) medium supplemented with 5% calf serum. The human WT and F72/74 αPDGFR were stably expressed in Ph cells to 1 × 105 receptors per cell, as described previously (5.Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The WT c-Cbl construct (kindly provided by Dr. Hamid Band) was subcloned into the pLHDCX3 retroviral vector, whose polylinker contains the following unique restriction sites:HindIII, SalI, BglII, andNotI. The c-Cbl construct in the retroviral vector was transfected into 293GPG cells (49.Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), the viral supernatant collected for 7 days, and concentrated by centrifugation (25,000 ×g, 90 min, 4 °C). Equal amounts of colony forming units from the concentrated virus were used to infect Ph cells expressing either WT or F72/74 mutant receptors. The SYF cells are SV-40 large T antigen-immortalized fibroblasts that were derived from mouse embryos harboring functional null mutations for Src family members, Src, Yes, and Fyn. Murine wild type c-Src was stably expressed in SYF cells to generate the SYF + Src cells (20.Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The SYF panel of cells was maintained in DME medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Since these cells expressed very low and dissimilar levels of αPDGFRs, the WT human αPDGFR was stably expressed to similar levels in the SYF panel of cells, using the 293GPG system as described above. The F cells are SV40 large T antigen-immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts established from E9 PDGFR-double-knockout embryos, which were kindly provided by M. Tallquist and P. Soriano (19.Andrews A.

F cells were maintained in DME medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The human WT and F72/74 αPDGFR were stably expressed in F cells using the 293GPG system as described above. The rabbit polyclonal αPDGFR antibodies recognize either the carboxyl terminus (27P) or a portion of the first immunoglobulin domain (80.8) of the human αPDGFR (5.Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The c-Cbl antibody used for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of c-Cbl was purchased from Santa Cruz (C-15; sc-170). For anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis, a combination of PY20 (Transduction Labs) and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) each at a 1:5,000 dilution was used. For anti-phospho-Erk Western blot analysis, a phospho-specific p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody purchased from New England BioLabs Inc. (number 9101L) was used at a 1:500 dilution. Ph cells expressing WT or F72/74 αPDGFR, together with either endogenous levels of c-Cbl or overexpressing c-Cbl, were grown to subconfluence, and incubated overnight in DME containing 0.1% calf serum. The cells were left resting or stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-AA for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with H/S (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmNa3VO4) and lysed in EB (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmNa3VO4, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin), and c-Cbl was immunoprecipitated using the c-Cbl antibody. Immune complexes were bound to formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus membranes, spun through EB + 10% sucrose, washed twice with 1.0 ml of EB, twice with 1.0 ml of PAN (10 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 20 μg/ml aprotinin) + 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and twice with 1.0 ml of PAN. Immunoprecipitates representing approximately 3 × 106cells were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon. For anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis, the membranes were incubated for 1 h in Block (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml BSA, 10 mg/ml ovalbumin, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.005% NaN3), and then further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody diluted in Block. The membranes were then washed and incubated for 30 min with secondary antibody: a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:4,000 in Block. Finally, the membranes were washed, and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to develop the Western blots. Subsequently, the membranes were stripped, incubated in Blotto (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml nonfat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.005% NaN3) for 1 h, and re-probed with an antibody against c-Cbl (diluted 1:500 in Blotto) for 1.5 h to determine the levels of protein present in the immunoprecipitates. The secondary antibody used was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:2,000 in Blotto. Ph WT or Ph F72/74 cells, expressing endogenous levels of c-Cbl, overexpressing WT c-Cbl, as well as SYF or SYF + Src cells expressing the WT αPDGFR, were grown to subconfluence, and radiolabeled overnight in cysteine/methionine-free DME containing 0.1% calf serum and 50 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine/methionine (Trans-labelTM, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). The medium was then changed to DME containing 2 mg/ml BSA, 300 mg/liter l-methionine, and 300 mg/literl-cysteine, and cells were stimulated with PDGF buffer (10 mm acetic acid containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) or 50 ng/ml PDGF-AA for the indicated times. The cells were washed twice with H/S and lysed in EB, the lysates were precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the αPDGFR was immunoprecipitated using the 27P antibody. Immune complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose, or formalin-fixed S. aureusmembranes, spun through EB + 10% sucrose, washed twice with 1.0 ml of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaPO4, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet-P40, 0.1% SDS, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mmNa3VO4, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol), twice with 1.0 ml of PAN + 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and twice with 1.0 ml of PAN. Immunoprecipitates representing approximately 1 × 106cells were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. To enhance the radioactive signal, the gel was incubated in a solution containing 10% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid for 10 min, washed twice in low-grade acetic acid for 10 min, incubated in 30% 2,5-diphenyloxazole/acetic acid for 1 h, and washed for 1 h in H2O. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The amount of mature and immature receptor was quantified by densitometry, the amount of mature receptor was normalized by the amount of immature receptor in each sample, which does not appreciably change over the course of the experiment (data not shown). The resulting values were plotted as a function of time. Cells were grown to subconfluence, serum starved in DME containing 0.1% calf serum overnight, and left resting or stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-AA at 37 °C for times indicated. The cells were washed twice with H/S, lysed in 1 ml of EB (without BSA), and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to remove insoluble debris. The amount of protein in the lysates was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and 30 μg of protein were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. The resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon, and probed with a phospho-Erk-specific antibody. PDGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake was assayed as follows. Cells were plated at 8 × 104 cells/ml in DME containing 5% calf serum in 24-well dishes and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. They were then washed 2 times in phosphate-buffered saline and arrested in 0.5 ml of DME containing 2 mg/ml BSA for 48 h at 37 °C. PDGF buffer, or various doses of PDGF-AA were added and incubated for 18–20 h at 37 °C. The cells were pulsed for 4 h with [3H]thymidine and harvested as described previously (7.DeMali K. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Triplicate samples were performed for each data point, and four independent experiments gave similar results. The data are expressed as a fold increase over the buffer control. F cells expressing either the WT or the F72/74 αPDGFR were used in the rabbit PVR model exactly as described previously (19.Andrews A. Balciunaite E. Leong F.L. Tallquist M. Soriano P. Refojo M. Kazlauskas A. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 2683-2689PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbits were anesthetized and gas compression vitrectomy performed, and after 3 days the gas was replaced with balanced saline solution. One hundred thousand F cells expressing either WT or F72/74 αPDGFR were then injected into the vitreous cavity through a 30-gauge needle 4 mm posterior to the limbus. The fundus was checked after the injection to exclude iatrogenic retinal damage, and out of a total of 37 animals, six were excluded from the study due to iatrogenic complications including retinal tear or lens damage. The rabbits were examined by the same examiner on days 1, 4, 7, 14, and 28 by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and an indirect ophthalmoscope with a +20 diopters fundus lens through dilated pupils (1% cyclopentolate HCl eye drops and 2.5% phenylephrine HCl eye drops, 0.05 ml of each). Each animal was examined at the outset of the experiment to rule out the presence of any pre-existing anterior and posterior segment ocular abnormalities. All procedures were performed under aseptic conditions and pursuant to the regulations of the ARVO Statement for the use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Clinical observations were graded according to the Fastenberg classification (stage 0–5), sketches made, and representative eyes were photographed (23.Fastenberg D.M. Diddie K.R. Sorgente N. Ryan S.J. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1982; 93: 559-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The animals were sacrificed on day 28. Our first goal was to test the possibility that SFKs contributed degradation of the αPDGFR in PDGF-stimulated cells. To this end, we compared the half-life of the WT receptor to that of a mutant αPDGFR in which the tyrosines required for binding and activation of SFKs (tyrosines 572 and 574) were replaced with phenylalanine (F72/74). The WT and F72/74 receptors were stably expressed in Patch (Ph) cells, which express normal levels of βPDGFRs, but no endogenous αPDGFRs. In this system, the F72/74 receptor is unable to bind or activate SFKs in response to PDGF-AA (5.Gelderloos J.A. Rosenkranz S. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5908-5915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase analysis indicated that the half-life of the two receptors was indistinguishable in resting cells (Fig.1, A and B). Exposure to PDGF dramatically reduced the half-life of the WT receptor. PDGF also promoted degradation of the F72/74 receptor, yet its half-life was much longer than the WT receptor (Fig. 1 B). Thus, mutation of tyrosines 572 and 574 affects the half-life of the receptor in activated, but not resting cells. Since the F72/74 receptor is unable to engage SFKs, it is possible that the PDGF-dependent acceleration of receptor degradation requires the assistance of SFKs. Other interpretations of the data in Fig. 1, A and B, include that tyrosines 572 and 574 are required for the binding of other proteins that are required for receptor degradation, or that substitution of these tyrosines to phenylalanines resulted in structural changes. One way to evaluate the likelihood of these interpretations is to compare PDGF-dependent receptor degradation is cells that have a WT αPDGFR, and do or do not express SFKs. In this experimental approach we turned to SYF cells, which lack the three ubiquitously expressed SFKs: Src, Yes, and Fyn; and SYF + Src cells, which are SYF cells in which c-Src was re-expressed (20.Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The half-life of the αPDGFR was similar in both cell lines, provided that they were not exposed to ligand (Fig. 1 C). PDGF enhanced receptor degradation in each cell line, however, it was faster in the cells expressing Src (Fig. 1 C). Thus expression of c-Src in SYF cells accelerated PDGF-dependent receptor degradation. Furthermore, these data support the idea that the prolonged half-life of the F72/74 αPDGFR relates to its inability to engage SFKs. Finally, two distinct experimental approaches indicate that SFKs promote degradation of the αPDGFR. To begin to investigate the mechanism by which SFKs contribute to the ligand-enhanced degradation of the αPDGFR, we focused on c-Cbl, which appears to be involved with SFKs in a number of signaling systems, and promotes degradation of receptor tyrosine kinases. We compared the effect of overexpression of c-Cbl on the half-lives of resting and PDGF-stimulated WT and F72/74 receptors. The c-Cbl cDNA was stably overexpressed (Fig. 2 A), and this did not alter the morphology or growth characteristics of cells cultured in serum-containing medium (data not shown). To assess the effect of c-Cbl overexpression on the degradation rate of the WT and F72/74 receptor, pulse-chase experiments were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Despite high levels of c-Cbl expression, there was no effect on the half-lives of the WT or of the F72/74 receptor in the absence of PDGF (Fig. 2, B and C). However, when cells were exposed to PDGF, the half-life of the WT receptor was markedly reduced in cells overexpressing c-Cbl (Fig. 2 B). This effect was most pronounced at the early time points. In contrast, increasing the cellular levels of c-Cbl had no effect on the degradation rate of the F72/74 αPDGFR (Fig. 2 C). Thus c-Cbl overexpression shortens the receptor half-life, but only in PDGF-stimulated cells, and only if the αPDGFR is able to engage SFKs. To begin to investigate how SFKs are involved with promoting the c-Cbl-dependent degradation of the αPDGFR, we tested whether tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl correlated with the ability of c-Cbl to shorten the half-life of the receptor. Quiescent cultures of cells expressing the WT or F72/74 receptor (expressing either endogenous levels of Cbl or overexpressing c-Cbl) were left resting or stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-AA for 5 min, the cells were lysed, c-Cbl was immunoprecipitated and subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis. Stimulation of WT receptor-expressing cells with PDGF promoted efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl (Fig.3 A). The PDGF-dependent increase in c-Cbl phosphorylation was reduced, although not absent, in cells expressing the F72/74 receptor. This difference between WT and F72/74 was more apparent in cells overexpressing c-Cbl (Fig. 3 B). Fig. 3. Reprobing of the anti-phosphotyrosine blot with an anti-c-Cbl antibody indicated that there were comparable amounts of c-Cbl present in all of the samples. We conclude that an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl correlated with its ability to promote receptor degradation. This idea is also supported by the findings that a c-Cbl point mutant (G306E), which is not tyrosine phosphorylated in response to PDGF, fails to shorten receptor half-life (12.Miyake S. Mullane-Robinson K.P. Lill N.L. Douillard P. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16619-16628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The prolonged half-life of the F72/74 receptor may lead to an enhancement of PDGF-induced downstream signaling events as compared with the WT receptor. To test this hypothesis, we compared the kinetics of PDGF-dependent activation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (Erk-1/2) in WT and F72/74 expressing cells, as well as the WT receptor-triggered response in cells that did or did not express Src. The cells were grown to subconfluence, arrested by serum starvation, and were left resting or stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-AA for up to 1 h. The cells were washed, lysed, equal amounts of protein were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel, and subjected to Western blot analysis using a phospho-Erk-specific antibody (Fig.4 A). Addition of PDGF-AA to empty vector expressing cells did not activate Erk, as these cells have no αPDGFRs. In WT receptor expressing cells, Erk was maximally phosphorylated 5 min after PDGF stimulation, and the signal declined to near baseline levels by 15 min. In contrast, the F72/74 receptor triggered a much stronger and prolonged response, which also was maximal at 5 min and only declined slightly during the first 60 min of PDGF stimulation Fig. 4 A). PDGF-induced Ras activation was also enhanced in the F72/74 cells (data not shown). An increase in PDGF-dependent Erk activation was also seen in SYF cells, whereas re-expression of c-Src reduced the PDGF-induced activation of Erk (Fig. 4 B). These findings suggested that prolonging the half-life of the αPDGFR resulted in enhanced signal relay. If the half-life of the receptor is indeed responsible for the differences in Erk activation between WT and F72/74 receptor, then overexpression of c-Cbl in WT receptor expressing cells should lead to diminished Erk phosphorylation upon PDGF stimulation, since it enhances the degradation rate of the receptor. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the PDGF-stimulated activation of Erk is weaker in cells overexpressing c-Cbl. The data in panels A-C of Fig. 4 indicate that the magnitude and duration of Erk activation reflects the half-life of the αPDGFR in PDGF-stimulated cells. To determine the relevance of these changes in signaling to biological responses, we compared PDGF-AA-induced DNA synthesis in WT and F72/74 receptor expressing Ph cells, as well as in WT receptor expressing cells that overexpressed c-Cbl. To measure entry into S-phase, quiescent cells were stimulated with increasing doses of PDGF-AA, pulsed with [3H]thymidine, harvested, and the incorporated radioactivity was counted. As shown in Fig. 4 D, stimulation of cells with PDGF-AA resulted in a dose-dependent increase in [3H]thymidine uptake in all three cell types. At every concentration of PDGF the response of the F72/74 cells was better than that of the WT receptor expressing cells. In contrast, overexpression of c-Cbl reduced the ability of the WT receptor to promote cell cycle progression. These data indicate that the degradation rate of the αPDGFR tightly correlates with the magnitude and duration of PDGF-induced signaling events. In addition, changes in the half-life of the receptor appear to have an impact on biological responses such as DNA synthesis. The finding that the F72/74 receptor was more efficient than the WT receptor in mediating PDGF-dependent responses in tissue culture cells (Fig. 4) raised the possibility that this mutant receptor would also be better in driving PDGF-induced pathological responses. PDGF has been implicated in PVR, a disease which occurs in up to 10% of patients undergoing surgery for retinal detachment (21.Robbins S.G. Mixon R.N. Wilson D.J. Hart C.E. Robertson J.E. Westra I.

Ophthalmol. 1997; 115: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We recently found that in a PVR rabbit model, the disease is strongly dependent on the αPDGFR (19.Andrews A. Balciunait"

Interaction of small t with PP2A promotes the growth of quiescent cells through stimulation of a signaling cascade involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), atypical protein kinase C ζ (PKC ζ), and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (17.Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Moreover, SV40 small t forces quiescent cells to re-enter the S phase of the cell cycle and stimulates SV40 DNA replication in CV-1 cells (19.Cicala C. Avantaggiati M.L. Graessmann A. Rundell K. Levine A.S. Carbone M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3138-3144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Small t also regulates the cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (20.Wheat W.H. Roesler W.J. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5881-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), AP-1- (21.Frost J.A. Alberts A.S. Sontag E. Guan K. Mumby M.C. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6244-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), NF-κB- (18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and serum response element-regulated promoters (21.Frost J.A. Alberts A.S. Sontag E. Guan K. Mumby M.C. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6244-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) in a PP2A-dependent fashion. All of these cellular effects of small t may explain its “helper” function during SV40 infection. Besides SV40, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) is one of the numerous viral promoters tightly regulated by Sp1 (22.Gaynor R. AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 23.Sune C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6572-6576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of T lymphocytes with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases (24.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar), induces the phosphorylation of Sp1 and activation of Sp1-dependent HIV-1 gene transcription (25.Vlach J. Garcia A. Jacqué J.-M. Rodriguez M.S. Michelson S. Virelizier J.-L. Virology. 1995; 208: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings prompted us to investigate whether interaction of small t with PP2A leads to up-regulation of Sp1 activity. We show here that expression of SV40 small t in quiescent CV-1 cells induces transactivation of two Sp1-dependent promoters through specific inhibition of endogenous PP2A activity. We also demonstrate that PI 3-kinase and PKC ζ are required for the transactivating effects of small t. Last, we show that inhibition of PI 3-kinase significantly delays the initiation of SV40 DNA replication during infection of CV-1 cells. Thus, in addition to providing evidence for a novel role for PI 3-kinase during SV40 infection, our results reveal PP2A enzymes and PI-3 kinase to be novel intracellular regulators of Sp1-dependent gene expression. Plasmids utilized in this study included the following: pCMV-HIVS(−84)luc and pG3-CAT (25.Vlach J. Garcia A. Jacqué J.-M. Rodriguez M.S. Michelson S. Virelizier J.-L.

Lozano J. Chapin R.S. Moscat J. Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Wortmannin and okadaic acid were purchased from Sigma, and LY294002 was purchased from Calbiochem. Monkey kidney CV-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) or CV-1 cells stably expressing SV40 wild-type small t (18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) were maintained at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum (Hyclone). Subconfluent cell cultures were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.) and as described previously (18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out at a constant amount of DNA, and duplicate or triplicate dishes of cells were used for each set of transfected plasmid. Under our experimental conditions, we found no statistical differences in the transfection efficiency between distinct sets of cells within one experiment. Cells were serum-starved 24 h post-transfection by incubation for 20 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Cells were then left untreated or incubated for 3–5 h with the appropriate agents (okadaic acid, wortmannin, or LY294002) in the same medium. Luciferase activity was determined 48 h post-transfection using the Luciferase Assay System kit from Promega, as described previously (18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured in duplicate aliquots (20 μl) of total cell extracts by measuring for 10 s the light emission in an Opticomp luminometer. CAT activity was measured 48 h post-transfection in 40 μl of total cell extract following exactly the procedures described previously (25.Vlach J. Garcia A. Jacqué J.-M. Rodriguez M.S. Michelson S. Virelizier J.-L. Virology. 1995; 208: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The luciferase and CAT activities were normalized to the protein concentration determined in the same sample using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Subconfluent CV-1 cells (100-mm dishes) were infected with 0.5 ml of plaque-purified wild-type SV40 virus (strain 776) at a multiplicity of 3–5 plaque-forming units/cell. Ten ml of medium containing 0.2% serum with or without 100 μm LY294002 or 100 nm wortmannin were added to the cells 2 h postinfection. At the indicated time postinfection, the viral DNA was extracted according to the protocol of Hirt (29.Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). The purified viral DNA from approximately one-fifth of a 100-mm dish of infected cells was digested with BamHI, fractionated on 1% agarose gel, and blotted on Hybond-N nylon membranes. Blots were hybridized with total 32P-labeled SV40 DNA. We first performed reporter gene assays in transfected CV-1 cells to address the possibility that SV40 small t induces Sp1-driven promoter activation. CV-1 cells were co-transfected with pCMV5 alone or pCMV5 plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant small t proteins, together with Sp1-responsive luciferase or CAT reporter constructs. The transfected cells were serum-starved, after which total extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase or CAT activity. As shown in Fig. 1 A, expression of wild-type small t resulted in a ∼7-fold increase in the activity of HIVS(−84)luc, a luciferase reporter construct under the control of a mutant of HIV-1 LTR deleted from all sequences upstream of three Sp1 sites (25.Vlach J. Garcia A. Jacqué J.-M. Rodriguez M.S. Michelson S. Virelizier J.-L. Virology. 1995; 208: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The effects of wild-type small t could be mimicked by incubating control cells with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid, which produced a ∼12-fold induction of luciferase activity. In contrast, expression of a truncated form of small t (mutant 3) lacking the PP2A-binding domain (17.Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) failed to induce these transactivating effects. Comparable results were obtained in cells transiently transfected with pG3-CAT (25.Vlach J. Garcia A. Jacqué J.-M. Rodriguez M.S. Michelson S. Virelizier J.-L. Virology. 1995; 208: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), an artificial plasmid containing the CAT gene driven by the TATA box of the adenovirus major late promoter coupled to three Sp1 motifs (Fig. 1 B). Okadaic acid treatment and expression of wild-type small t, but not mutant 3, resulted in a ∼10- and ∼5-fold increase in CAT activity relative to control cells, respectively. Control experiments showed that the basal activity of each corresponding HIVS(−84)luc or pG3-CAT constructs deleted from the three Sp1 sites was not affected by okadaic acid, as reported previously (25.Vlach J. Garcia A. Jacqué J.-M. Rodriguez M.S. Michelson S. Virelizier J.-L. Virology. 1995; 208: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), or by small t proteins (data not shown). AC dimers and ABαC holoenzymes account for the majority of PP2A activity in CV-1 cells, whereas AC-small t heterotrimers are the prevalent PP2A species in SV40-infected and SV40 small t-transfected CV-1 cells (13.Rundell K. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The AC-small t complexes appear to be relatively unstable, since they can dissociate and reform in cellular extracts (13.Rundell K. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Small t can directly bind to free AC dimers and, at least in part, displace Bα from ABαC holoenzymes, resulting in subsequent inhibition of PP2A activity in CV-1 cells. However, residual AC and ABαC enzymes are still present in small t-expressing cells (17.Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The inability of small t mutant 3 to promote Sp1-driven promoter transactivation (Fig. 1) suggested that the effects of SV40 small t were dependent on its interaction with PP2A. To further substantiate this assumption, and because the B56 (also termed B′ or PR56) regulatory subunits of PP2A can compete in vitro with small t for binding to the AC core enzyme (15.Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 195-210Google Scholar), we compared the effects of overexpressing various B56 regulatory subunits on small t-dependent Sp1 transactivation. CV-1 cells stably expressing wild-type small t were co-transfected with HIVS(−84)luc and plasmids encoding the three different isoforms (α, β, and γ1) of the B56 family of PP2A regulatory subunits (for nomenclature, see Ref.28.Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapin R.S. Moscat J. Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, expression of either B56α, B56β, or B56γ1 suppressed the induction of HIVS(−84)luc by small t. Significantly, these inhibitory effects could be reversed by incubating B56-transfected cells with okadaic acid, suggesting that overexpressed B56 subunits down-regulated Sp1-driven promoter activity by altering the levels of endogenous PP2A activity. Together, these findings support a role for PP2A in small t-dependent Sp1 regulation. They also provide the first evidence that changes in the intracellular subunit composition of PP2A can differentially affect Sp1-dependent gene activity. We have reported that two bifunctional signaling pathways involving PI 3-kinase (p110-p85α) and PKC ζ mediate the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and NF-κB by small t in CV-1 cells (18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To analyze the participation of PI 3-kinase in the regulation of Sp1, small t-expressing cells were treated with 100 nm wortmannin or 100 μm LY294002. Our previous data indicate that, at these concentrations, these two structurally unrelated pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (30.Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) inhibit small t-mediated stimulation of PKC ζ activity and cell proliferation in CV-1 cells (18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, small t-expressing cells were co-transfected with HIVS(−84)luc and a plasmid encoding a dominant-negative mutant of the p85α regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (Δp85α) (18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26.Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clarks A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, wortmannin, LY294002, and expressed Δp85α nearly entirely suppressed the induction of HIVS(−84)luc by small t. Interestingly, expression of dominant-negative mutant forms of PKC ζ, but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2, prevented Sp1-dependent gene transactivation as efficiently as the PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Stimulation of Sp1 upon SV40 infection of CV-1 cells leads to enhanced expression of SV40 viral and cellular promoters (6.Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 8.Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Thurston S.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). By compromising the ability of small t to transactivate NF-κB (18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and Sp1 (Fig. 3), PI 3-kinase may play a key role during SV40 infection. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the initiation of SV40 DNA replication in CV-1 cells infected with viral particles. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” after viral adsorption, cells were cultured in the presence of 0.2% serum, in the absence or presence of either LY294002 or wortmannin. Under these experimental conditions, and at the time periods examined (19–36 h postinfection), the infected CV-1 cells were in a quiescent state, as confirmed by parallel experiments measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation (data not shown). The viral DNA was purified from the infected cells and analyzed by Southern blot. Fig.4 shows that the levels of newly replicated SV40 DNA detected 20 h postinfection in control, untreated CV-1 cells were reduced in infected cells that had been incubated with 100 nm wortmannin or 100 μmLY294002. We also found that, in the time period examined, treatment of cells with wortmannin or LY294002 did not affect cellular viability, and equivalent numbers of cells were recovered from untreated or treated cells in each experimental condition. Thus, inhibition of early SV40 DNA synthesis by wortmannin or LY294002 cannot be attributed to putative cytotoxic effects of these compounds. These results strongly suggest that PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanisms regulate the early phase of SV40 DNA replication. We have previously reported that, in quiescent CV-1 cells, interaction of SV40 small t with endogenous AC and ABαC forms of PP2A (17.Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) activates HIV-1 LTR and NF-κB, and these effects are dependent on both functional PI 3-kinase and PKC ζ (18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Since both NF-κB and Sp1 regulate HIV-1 LTR activity (22.Gaynor R. AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), we investigated here the effects of small t, PI 3-kinase, and PKC ζ on Sp1 regulation. We first show (Fig. 1) that small t and okadaic acid induce Sp1 transactivation in CV-1 cells. Significantly, okadaic acid has similar effects in J. Jhan cells (25.Vlach J. Garcia A. Jacqué J.-M. Rodriguez M.S. Michelson S. Virelizier J.-L. Virology. 1995; 208: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consistent with a specific involvement of PP2A in Sp1 regulation, all three B56 (α, β, γ1) regulatory subunits of PP2A counteracted the transactivation of Sp1 induced by small t, but not okadaic acid (Fig. 2). When present in excess, B56 regulatory subunits of PP2A can displace small t from AC-small t complexes in vitro (15.Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 195-210Google Scholar). We therefore propose that, following overexpression of B56, the displacement of small t and subsequent formation of AB56C heterotrimers simply reverse PP2A inhibition by small t. Interestingly, in CV-1 cells, AC and ABαC are present in both cytoplasm and nuclear subcellular compartments, whereas AB56αC and AB56βC are concentrated in the cytoplasm, and AB56 γ1C is targeted to the nucleus (15.Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 195-210Google Scholar, 16.McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 17.Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Results from our overexpression studies imply that both cytosolic and nuclear forms of PP2A have the potential to regulate Sp1, either directly or indirectly. Thus, any alterations in the subcellular distribution and ratio between the endogenous AC core enzyme and PP2A holoenzymes could affect Sp1-dependent promoter transactivation. Beside PP2A, we have identified PI 3-kinase and atypical PKC ζ as novel regulators of Sp1-responsive promoter activity in CV-1 cells (Fig. 3). Although not presented here, we found similar results in mouse NIH 3T3 and human J. Jhan cells, suggesting that the regulatory mechanisms described in CV-1 cells are not restricted to this unique cell type. The existence of a nuclear pool of PKC ζ in CV-1 cells 2E. Sontag, unpublished data.suggests that PKC ζ could directly regulate Sp1. Indeed, PKC ζ has been recently reported to bind to and phosphorylate the zinc finger region of Sp1 in vitro and in carcinoma cell lines (32.Pal S. Claffey K.P. Cohen H.T. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26277-26280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our findings are clearly important for understanding the biology of SV40. First, small t transactivates SV40 early and late promoters (33.Bikel I. Loeken M.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, infection of CV-1 cells with SV40 leads to a ∼10-fold increase in the intracellular levels of Sp1 mRNA and proteins, and this effect can be attributed to expression of an early viral protein (8.Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Thurston S.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since Sp1 stimulates the activity of the SV40 early promoter, its enhanced expression may be critical for the viral life cycle (1.Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Mutant SV40 viruses that lack small t antigen replicate less efficiently than the wild-type virus, and microinjection of small t in CV-1 cells stimulates the replication of wild-type and small t deletion mutant viruses (19.Cicala C. Avantaggiati M.L. Graessmann A. Rundell K. Levine A.S. Carbone M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3138-3144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, we found in this study that two PI 3-kinase inhibitors, which are potent suppressors of small t signaling (18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), also inhibit the initiation of SV40 DNA replication (Fig. 4). Based on our data (Ref. 18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar and Fig. 1), we propose that transactivation of NF-κB and Sp1-dependent SV40 viral promoters by small t is involved in the initiation of SV40 DNA replication. In this context, it is noteworthy that expression of large T correlates with induction of Sp1 during the early phase of viral infection (6.Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Large T plays a critical function in the initiation of viral DNA synthesis by unwinding the SV40 origin of replication (10.Virshup D.M. Russo A.A.R. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4883-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has been previously documented that nuclear B56-containing holoenzymes activate large T by dephosphorylating Ser-120 and Ser-123 residues, whereas AC and ABαC inactivate large T by dephosphorylating Thr-124 (10.Virshup D.M. Russo A.A.R. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4883-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34.Cegielska A. Shaffer S. Derua R. Goris J. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4616-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Since small t can selectively bind to and inhibit AC and ABαC, but not AB56C (15.Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 195-210Google Scholar,18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), it could promote the activation of large T. Transactivation of Sp1 by AC-small t may represent a means for SV40 viruses to enhance transcription from the early SV40 promoter at times when large T levels are low. Together, these results support the notion that SV40 DNA replication is controlled by intricate mechanisms that depend on the concerted action of distinct hosts' PP2A isoforms and viral antigens. Besides regulating SV40, Sp1 elevates the expression of a large variety of viral and cellular promoters. Sp1 interacts with several components of the cell cycle machinery, including the transcription factor E2F (35.Lin S.Y. Black A.R. Kostic D. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and Rb-like proteins (36.Shao Z. Robbins P.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar). Increased cellular levels of Sp1 proteins and activity have been linked to cell proliferation and tumor progression (37.Gunther M. Frebourg T. Laithier M. Fossar N. Bouziane-Ouartini M. Lavialle C. Brison O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2490-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 38.Kitadai Y. Yasui W. Yokozaki H. Kuniyasu H. Haruma K. Kajiyama G. Tahara E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1342-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 39.Mortensen E.R. Marks P.A. Shiotani A. Merchant J.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The transactivation of Sp1-driven cellular promoters by small t may therefore account for its ability to promote growth and transformation of quiescent CV-1 cells. It is also of particular interest that efficient viral transcription and replication of HIV-1 requires both Sp1 sites and the interaction of Sp1 proteins with the viral transcription factor HIV-1 Tat (23.Sune C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6572-6576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Chang L.J. McNulty E. Martin M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 743-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Harrich D. Garcia J.

Virol. 1991; 65: 4350-4358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, changes in the ratio of PP2A core enzyme to holoenzyme were found to affect Tat-dependent HIV-1 transcription (44.Ruediger R. Brewis N. Ohst K. Walter G. Virology. 1997; 238: 432-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our results showing that overexpression of distinct PP2A subunits differentially deregulates Sp1-dependent HIV-1 LTR activity (Fig. 2) support these findings. We have demonstrated that, following expression of small t, PI-3 kinase-dependent activation of PKC ζ induces transactivation of NF-κB-responsive promoters, including HIV-1 LTR (18.Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the cooperative interaction between NF-κB and Sp1 is crucial for transcriptional activation of HIV1-LTR (45.Perkins N.D. Edwards L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3551-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Moreover, induction of Sp1 during cytomegalovirus infection mediates up-regulation of NF-κB promoters (46.Yurochko A.D. Mayo M.W. Poma E.E. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Huang E.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4638-4648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, Sp1 directly interacts with NF-κB-binding sites, providing a means to keep basal levels of NF-κB-dependent gene expression elevated in the absence of activated NF-κB (47.Hirano F. Tanaka H. Hirano Y. Hiramoto M. Handa H. Makino I. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). By regulating both NF-κB and Sp1, the signaling involving PP2A, PI 3-kinase, and PKC ζ may play a critical role in the transcriptional regulation of not only SV40 but also HIV-1 promoters. Results obtained with small t suggest that deregulation of this signaling may be strategically targeted by viruses to elevate viral and cellular gene expression during infection of resting cells.

In the model system involving the visual GPCR rhodopsin, activation and phosphorylation of rhodopsin is thought to convert arrestin from a low to high affinity binding state. Phosphorylation of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) has been shown to be required for binding of arrestins 2 and 3 in vitro and for arrestin-enhanced internalization in intact cells (Pals-Rylaarsdam, R., and Hosey, M. M. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 14152–14158). For the M2 mAChR, arrestin binding requires phosphorylation at multiple serine and threonine residues at amino acids 307–311 in the third intracellular (i3) loop. Here, we have investigated the molecular basis for the requirement of receptor phosphorylation for arrestin binding. Constructs of arrestin 2 that can bind to other GPCRs in a phosphorylation-independent manner were unable to interact with a mutant M2 mAChR in which the Ser/Thr residues at 307–311 were mutated to alanines. However, although phosphorylation-deficient mutants of the M2 mAChR that lacked 50–157 amino acids from the i3 loop were unable to undergo agonist-dependent internalization when expressed alone in tsA201 cells, co-expression of arrestin 2 or 3 restored agonist-dependent internalization. Furthermore, a deletion of only 15 amino acids (amino acids 304–319) was sufficient to allow for phosphorylation-independent arrestin-receptor interaction. These results indicate that phosphorylation at residues 307–311 does not appear to be required to activate arrestin into a high affinity binding state. Instead, phosphorylation at residues 307–311 appears to facilitate the removal of an inhibitory constraint that precludes receptor-arrestin association in the absence of receptor phosphorylation.

Endogenous mono-ADP-ribosylation has also been described in eukaryotic cellular systems; ADP-ribosyltransferases that catalyze ADP-ribosylation of arginine residues of G proteins (similar to cholera toxin) have been described in many cells and tissues (9.Zolkiewska A.

Thus, some of these enzymes are able to modify G proteins (15.Watkins P.A. Kanaho Y. Moss J. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 16.Ehret-Hilberer S. Nullans G.

It has also been proposed that an ADP-ribosyltransferase may be coupled to an ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase that is able to remove the ADP-ribose group and hence regenerate free arginine, completing an ADP-ribosylation cycle that can reversibly regulate the functions of substrate proteins (18.Moss J.

An example of this cycle in eukaryotes is given by desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein as follows: ADP-ribosylation blocks the assembly of desmin into 10-nm filaments in vitro, and an incubation with ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase restores the self-assembly properties of desmin (20.Soman G.

Here we report the direct demonstration of endogenous mono-ADP-ribosylation of the G protein β subunit, and we provide evidence that this modification can modulate βγ activity in a similar way to the regulation of some G protein α subunits. Thus we propose that the ADP-ribosylation/deribosylation cycle of the βγ subunit might represent a novel cellular mechanism to regulate G protein-mediated signal transduction.

Cholera toxin was from Calbiochem, and pertussis toxin was a generous gift of Dr. R. Rappuoli (Chiron Vaccines, Siena, Italy). Tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was from Worthington. Other chemicals used were obtained from Sigma at the highest available purities.

Simond (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Baculovirus encoding His6-αi1 was a generous gift of Dr. P. Gierschik (University of Ulm, Germany). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in monolayers at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 34 μg/ml proline, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Plasma membranes were prepared as described previously (23.Gettys T.W. Sheriff-Carter K. Moomaw J. Taylor I.J. Raymond J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), with the following modification: cells (6 × 108 cells for each preparation) were washed with HBSS, detached with hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm TES (pH 7.0) and 1 mm EDTA, and then lysed with a Teflon/glass Potter homogenizer. CHO cytosol was prepared as described previously (24.Di Girolamo M. Silletta M.G. De Matteis M.A. Braca A. Colanzi A. Pawlak P. Rasenick M.M. Luini A. Corda D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7065-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), with the following modification: CHO cells (detached in HBSS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, plus 5 mm EGTA), were broken (109 cells/ml) by sonication in 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmEGTA, and protease inhibitors. Samples (4-μg plasma membranes) were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.5 mmMgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mm thymidine, 30 μm β-NAD, 1–2 μCi of [32P]NAD (specific activity, 1000 Ci/mmol), and (where specified) 0.05–0.5 μg of purified bovine brain βγ (either generously provided by Dr. W. F. Simonds, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, or purified as described previously (25.Sternweis P.C. Pang I. Hulme E.C. Receptor-Effector Coupling. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 1-30Google Scholar)). Pertussis and cholera toxin ADP-ribosylations were performed as described previously (26.Di Girolamo M. D'Arcangelo D. Cacciamani T. Gierschik P. Corda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17397-17403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by diluting the samples with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, followed by 2 min boiling, and analysis by 10% SDS-PAGE without or with 4 m urea. Proteins were electroblotted (4 h at 500 mA) onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the filters were exposed for about 12 h to Kodak X-Omat film using an intensifying screen. For quantitative analysis an Instantimager (Packard Instrument Co.) was employed. Following the ADP-ribosylation assay,32P-labeled plasma membranes were washed twice with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 50 μg of CHO cell cytosol, without or with 10 mmMgCl2 (in 50 μl of 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and protease inhibitors). The analysis of protein samples was performed as described above for the ADP-ribosylation assay, whereas the labeled compounds released in the supernatant were separated by HPLC with a Partisil 10 SAX column (4.6 mm × 25 cm; Whatman) using a non-linear gradient of 0–1 m ammonium phosphate (pH 3.35) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (a linear gradient of 0–15 mmammonium phosphate for the first 45 min, 15–24 mm for 1 min, 24–45 mm from 46 to 80 min, and 45 mmto 1 m for the last min). Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and the 32P radioactivity was evaluated by scintillation counting. The ADP-ribosylated β subunit was immunoprecipitated as described previously (27.Morris D. McHugh-Sutkowski E. Moos M. Simonds W.F. Spiegel A.M. Seamon K.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9079-9084Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), with the difference that plasma membranes were solubilized with 1% sodium cholate for 1 h at 4 °C. For immunoblot analysis, antisera raised against the amino-terminal decapeptide of the β subunit (MSELDQLRQE, the MS 1 antiserum; Ref.28.Murakami T. Simonds W. Spiegel A.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the carboxyl-terminal peptide (which includes residues 330–340, GSWDSFLKIWN, the SW28 antiserum; Ref. 28.Murakami T. Simonds W. Spiegel A.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were employed. Antibody-antigen complexes were visualized using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (26.Di Girolamo M. D'Arcangelo D. Cacciamani T. Gierschik P. Corda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17397-17403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were ADP-ribosylated for 2 h at 37 °C. Trypsin, dissolved in 1 mm HCl, was added at a concentration of 0.01 mg/ml (the final HCl concentration of 0.1 mm did not affect the ADP-ribosylation). The samples were incubated in the presence of trypsin or HCl for 30 min at 37 °C, as described previously (29.Thomas T.C. Sladek T. Yi F. Smith T. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 321: 8628-8635Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Proteolysis was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. 200 μg of washed, [32P]ADP-ribosylated plasma membranes were stirred at 4 °C for 60 min in 0.6 ml of PBS buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% sodium cholate and 1 mm DTT. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and 0.2 ml of the cholate extract (supernatant) were applied to a Sepharose 12 HR 10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The column was equilibrated and eluted with PBS buffer containing 1% cholate and 1 mm DTT. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected, with the protein elution pattern being evaluated by the absorbance at 254 nm. The column was calibrated with the following molecular mass standard proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease (13.7 kDa). Confluent CHO cells (2.5 × 106 cells/35 mm dish) were metabolically labeled as described previously (30.Staddon J.M. Bouzyk M.M. Rozengurt E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31.Frieden P.J. Gaut R.J. Hendershot L.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: the cells in each well were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with 100 μCi of [3H]adenine (specific activity, 20–40 Ci/mmol) in 1 ml of DMEM without fetal calf serum, containing 20 μg/ml actinomycin D to avoid [3H]adenine incorporation into RNA. The labeled medium was replaced with fresh medium, and the incubation was carried out for an additional 4 h in the absence or in the presence of pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml). Then the supernatant was removed, and the incubation was continued for 10 min at 37 °C with RNase (100 μg/ml) in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reaction was terminated by diluting the samples with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, followed by 2 min boiling and analysis by 10% SDS-PAGE. The protein-associated radioactivity was evaluated by a Bio-Imaging Analyzer (FUJI Film) or by fluorography with the gels exposed for at least 20 and 90 days, respectively. To verify the [3H]adenine incorporation into the cellular NAD+ pool, radiolabeled CHO cells were extracted with methanol/chloroform/water/12 n HCl (1:1:0.5:0.01) and analyzed by HPLC as described above, with the following modifications: H2O for the first 5 min, followed by a linear gradient of 0–30 mm ammonium phosphate (5–55 min), and of 30 mm to 1 m (55–115 min). [3H]NAD represented ∼8% of the total [3H]adenine metabolites. Moreover, the CHO intracellular NAD concentration was determined, considering that 106 cells have a volume of 1.2 μl (as measured by a Coulter Counter ZM linked to a Coulter Channelizer 256), and was found to be 785 ± 10 μm. This allows the calculation of the specific radioactivity of the NAD+ pool as 380 μCi/mmol, the value used to estimate the amount of the endogenously mono-ADP-ribosylated β subunit. [3H]Adenine-labeled CHO cells (6 × 107 for each experiment) were washed with HBSS and then broken with a Teflon/glass Potter homogenizer in hypotonic buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmEGTA, and protease inhibitors. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation (10 min at 600 × g), and the crude membranes (300 μg) were collected by centrifuging the supernatant for 15 min at 25,000 × g. The3H-labeled βγ subunit were extracted and analyzed as described previously (32.Tanaka T. Kubota M. Samizo K. Nakajima Y. Hoshino M. Kohno T. Wakamatsu K. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), with the difference that His6-αi1 was employed to reassociate with βγ. After washing with NaSCN, the bound βγ subunits were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed as described above. About 2 μg of βγ were recovered from this affinity purification (as estimated by densitometric analysis of the immunoblot) with ∼0.2% being modified in intact cells. Membranes (25 μg/25 μl) prepared from freshly dissected rat brain (33.De Matteis M.A. Di Girolamo M. Colanzi A. Pallas M. Di Tullio G. McDonald L.J. Moss J. Santini G. Bannykh S. Corda D. Luini A.

Science. 1995; 268: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), with the exception that cAMP was separated by thin layer chromatography using silica gel G plates (Kieselgel 60 F254, Merck) pretreated with 1% potassium oxalate and 2 mm EDTA, with chloroform/methanol/4m NH4OH (54:42:12) as the solvent system. The effect of the ADP-ribosylated βγ subunit was evaluated by adding to the reaction mixture 7 μg of plasma membranes from CHO cells preincubated for 6 h at 37 °C with different concentrations of purified bovine brain βγ subunit (100–500 nm), in the absence (“unmodified”) or presence (“modified”) of 1 mm NAD+ (under these experimental conditions about 60–80% of the added βγ subunit was ADP-ribosylated). After the incubation, CHO membranes containing either unmodified or modified βγ subunit were centrifuged (15 min at 12,000 × g) and resuspended in 5 μl of 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and 0.1% Lubrol, and then added to the adenylyl cyclase assay mixture. Point mutations were generated using the Quickchange, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the sequence of all constructs was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22052-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. Substrates of endogenous ADP-ribosylation can be identified by supplying cell extracts with radiolabeled NAD+. In enriched plasma membrane preparations from different cell lines, including Swiss 3T3, CHO and HL60 cells, NAD+ prominently labeled a 36-kDa protein (Fig.1 A). In the CHO preparation, the labeled protein co-migrated with the purified G protein β subunit on SDS-PAGE and was recognized on Western blots by a polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of the β subunit (SW28, which stains a doublet representing the β1and β2 isoforms) (Fig. 1, B and C). Purified bovine brain βγ subunit added to the assay mixture was also ADP-ribosylated (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 and Fig. 1, B and C, lane 2) and precisely co-migrated with the ADP-ribosylated 36-kDa endogenous protein on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1, 3, 5,7, and 9 and Fig. 1, B andC, lanes 1, and 3–6). The labeled 36-kDa band contained both the ADP-ribosylated β1 and β2 subunits, and the doublet could be fully resolved employing extra-long gels for the protein separation (Fig. 1,B and C). It has been reported that the electrophoretic mobility of the G protein β subunit is decreased when urea (4 m) is introduced into the SDS-PAGE (38.Wieland T. Nurnberg B. Ulibarri I. Kaldenberg-Stasch S. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18111-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the ADP-ribosylated protein recognized by the SW28 antibody had a higher apparent molecular mass (39 kDa) and, again, precisely co-migrated with pure β subunit (Fig. 1 C), whereas the mobility of other proteins, such as the G protein α subunit (αi, ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin,lane 4, and αs, ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin, lane 6, of Fig. 1, B and C), remained unchanged. Thus the major substrate of endogenous ADP-ribosylation in these enriched plasma membrane preparations appears to be the G protein β subunit. Moreover, to exclude the possibility that this is another ADP-ribosylated protein that can co-migrate on SDS-PAGE (plus or minus urea) with the β subunit, we immunoprecipitated the solubilized, ADP-ribosylated CHO membranes with the SW28 antibody. Both the labeled endogenous 36-kDa protein (Fig.2 A, lane 3) and the labeled purified β subunit (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) were immunoprecipitated by the SW28 antibody; as a control, non-immune rabbit serum did not precipitate any radioactivity (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Moreover, when solubilized from membranes and analyzed by gel filtration chromatography, the ADP-ribosylated 36-kDa protein eluted as a single peak of ∼50-kDa (Fig. 2 B), which completely overlapped with the peak of the β subunit as revealed by the SW28 antibody (Fig. 2 C). Thus we provide compelling evidence indicating that the substrate of endogenous ADP-ribosylation is the β subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein.Figure 2Immunoprecipitation of the ADP-ribosylated G protein β subunit. A, CHO plasma membrane proteins ADP-ribosylated in the absence (lanes 1 and 3) and in the presence (lane 2) of purified bovine brain βγ subunit (2.5 μg/ml) were solubilized and subjected to immunoprecipitation using a non-immune serum (lane 1) or the β-specific SW28 antiserum (lanes 2 and3).

This caused the release of radiolabeled 5′-AMP (∼70% of total radioactivity, as analyzed by HPLC; data not shown), which is considered diagnostic of mono-ADP-ribosylation (33.De Matteis M.A. Di Girolamo M. Colanzi A. Pallas M. Di Tullio G. McDonald L.J. Moss J. Santini G. Bannykh S. Corda D. Luini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Non-enzymatic mono-ADP-ribosylation, which might be caused by the formation of adducts with ADP-ribose generated from NAD+ by cellular NAD-glycohydrolases (NADases) (39.Hiltz H. Koch R. Fanick W. Klapproth K. Adamietz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3929-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was ruled out because the β subunit was not labeled by free ADP-ribose (Fig.3 A, lane 2). The modified amino acid of the β subunit was further investigated by means of a characterization of the chemical stability of the ADP-ribosyl linkage. Treatment of the [32P]ADP-ribosylated β subunit for 12 h with NH2OH (which hydrolyzes the ADP-ribose of arginine), as opposed to HgCl2 or HCl (which act on ADP-ribosylated cysteine and serine/threonine residues, respectively), completely removed the ADP-ribose bound to the β subunit (Fig. 3 B, lane 2), as we also observed with the [32P]ADP-ribosylated α subunit of Gsinduced by cholera toxin (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). The possibility that the ADP-ribose is linked to glutamate could be ruled out since a 20-min treatment with NH2OH (a time sufficient to hydrolyze the ADP-ribose linked to glutamate) removed only 22% of the label from the ADP-ribosylated β subunit (a 55% loss of label was observed after 2 h and, as mentioned above, the complete loss of label occurred at 12 h). These results indicate that the mono-ADP-ribosylation occurs at an arginine residue of the β subunit. In line with these data, the mono-ADP-ribosylation of the β subunit was inhibited by agmatine (data not shown) and bymeta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C), both well characterized inhibitors of arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (40.Loesberg C. van Rooij H. Smets L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1037: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 41.Smets L.A. Loesberg C. Janssen M. Van Rooij H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, a plasma membrane-associated, arginine-specific, mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase can ADP-ribosylate the β subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. Notably, the enzyme displayed a good degree of specificity for the β subunit, indicated by the fact that this protein is the most intensely labeled in membrane preparations (as seen in Fig. 1, B andC). A kinetic investigation of the ADP-ribosylation assays employing purified bovine brain βγ subunit and enriched plasma membranes as the enzyme source gave a K m value for NAD+ of 350 ± 20 μm, a value compatible with the physiological concentrations of NAD+ (see “Experimental Procedures” for calculation of the CHO intracellular NAD concentration and Ref. 42.Lee A.-C.

This rate might conceivably be regulated by activators (and/or co-factors) yet to be identified and, hence, might well be faster in the natural intracellular milieu.

https://openalex.org/W2018915186,"The glycerophosphate backbone for triglyceride synthesis is commonly believed to be created through the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) to sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (GP), which is then converted by glycerophosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) to 1-acyl-GP. Consistent with this, GPD and GPAT are highly induced during differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. While the acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate (acyl-DHAP) pathway for glycerolipid synthesis is commonly believed to be involved only in glycerol ether lipid synthesis, we report here that during conversion of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes, the specific activity of peroxisomal DHAP acyltransferase (DHAPAT) is increased by 9-fold in 6 days, while acyl-DHAP:NADPH reductase is induced by 5-fold. A parallel increase in the catalase (the peroxisomal marker enzyme) activity is also seen. In contrast, the specific activity of alkyl-DHAP synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of the ether bond, is decreased by 60% during the same period. Unlike microsomal GPAT, the induced DHAPAT is found to have high activity at pH 5.5 and is resistant to inhibition by sulfhydryl agents, heat, and proteolysis. On subcellular fractionation, DHAPAT is found to be associated with microperoxisomes whereas GPAT activity is mainly present in microsomes. Northern blot analyses reveal that induction of DHAPAT can be largely explained through increases in DHAPAT mRNA. A comparison of microsomal and peroxisomal glycerolipid synthetic pathways, usingd-[3-3H, U-14C]glucose as the precursor of the lipid glycerol backbone shows that about 40–50% of triglyceride is synthesized via the acyl-DHAP pathway. These results indicate that the acyl-DHAP pathway is important not only for the synthesis of ether lipids, but also for the synthesis of triacylglycerol and other non-ether glycerolipids. The glycerophosphate backbone for triglyceride synthesis is commonly believed to be created through the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) to sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (GP), which is then converted by glycerophosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) to 1-acyl-GP. Consistent with this, GPD and GPAT are highly induced during differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. While the acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate (acyl-DHAP) pathway for glycerolipid synthesis is commonly believed to be involved only in glycerol ether lipid synthesis, we report here that during conversion of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes, the specific activity of peroxisomal DHAP acyltransferase (DHAPAT) is increased by 9-fold in 6 days, while acyl-DHAP:NADPH reductase is induced by 5-fold. A parallel increase in the catalase (the peroxisomal marker enzyme) activity is also seen. In contrast, the specific activity of alkyl-DHAP synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of the ether bond, is decreased by 60% during the same period. Unlike microsomal GPAT, the induced DHAPAT is found to have high activity at pH 5.5 and is resistant to inhibition by sulfhydryl agents, heat, and proteolysis. On subcellular fractionation, DHAPAT is found to be associated with microperoxisomes whereas GPAT activity is mainly present in microsomes. Northern blot analyses reveal that induction of DHAPAT can be largely explained through increases in DHAPAT mRNA. A comparison of microsomal and peroxisomal glycerolipid synthetic pathways, usingd-[3-3H, U-14C]glucose as the precursor of the lipid glycerol backbone shows that about 40–50% of triglyceride is synthesized via the acyl-DHAP pathway. These results indicate that the acyl-DHAP pathway is important not only for the synthesis of ether lipids, but also for the synthesis of triacylglycerol and other non-ether glycerolipids. glycerophosphate dehydrogenase sn-glycerol 3-phosphate dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase 1-acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase triacylglycerol N-ethylmaleimide methylmethane thiosulfonate endoplasmic reticulum 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine PE plasmalogens Preadipocyte cell lines (1.Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (746) Google Scholar) have been widely used to study the induction of a number of enzymes and receptors and also the mechanism of differentiation at the genetic level (2.MacDougald O.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The fibroblast-like mouse 3T3-L1 cells differentiate in response to high concentrations of insulin and other agents to cells that synthesize large amounts of triglycerides and are morphologically similar to adipose cells (4.Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). A similar cell line (3T3-F442A), on transplantation in mice has been reported to develop into adipose tissue (5.Green H. Kehinde O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 101: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). During differentiation, lipogenic enzymes of the triglyceride biosynthetic pathway, as well as the ancillary enzymes needed for the formation of substrates and cofactors are induced (6.Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). As outlined in Fig. 1, enzymes starting from the cytosolic glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD),1 catalyzing the biosynthesis of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (GP) followed by the glycerophosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), 1-acyl-GP acyltransferase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DAGAT) are highly induced during differentiation (7.Kuri-Harcuch W.

Coleman and Bell (10.Coleman R.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7681-7687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that due to nonspecificity of microsomal GPAT, which catalyzes the acylation of both GP and DHAP, DHAPAT activity is also induced during differentiation of these cells. All animal cells, however, have been shown to contain a specific peroxisomal DHAPAT which does not contain GPAT activity (11.Hajra A.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12.Webber K.O. Hajra A.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This DHAPAT, co-localized in peroxisomes with acyl/alkyl DHAP:NADPH reductase and alkyl-DHAP synthase, is generally believed to be involved in the synthesis of glycerol ether lipids (11.Hajra A.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,13.Kennedy E.P. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Roelofsen B. Wirtz K.W.A. Lipids and Membranes: Past, Present and Future. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1986: 171-206Google Scholar). Novikoff and co-workers (4.Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) reported that during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells there is a large increase in the number of peroxisomes (catalase-containing organelles) and the amount of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and in an abstract, they also reported that DHAPAT in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells was associated with peroxisomes (14.Rothblatt J.A. Novikoff A.B. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 361Google Scholar). In light of our progress in purifying specific DHAPAT (15.Webber K.O. Hajra A.K. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and the recent cloning of its cDNA (16.Thai T.P. Heid H. Rackwitz H.R. Hunziker A. Gorgas K. Just W.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17.Ofman R. Hattema E.H. Hogenbaut E.M. Caruso U. Muijsers A.O. Wanders R.J. Human Mol. Gen. 1998; 7: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we examined whether peroxisomal DHAPAT is induced during differentiation of these cells, along with the nonspecific microsomal GPAT, by studying the properties and subcellular distributions of the enzymes. The results indicate that peroxisomal DHAPAT and its mRNA are indeed induced during adipogenesis. Our current studies indicate that while peroxisomal DHAPAT and acyl-DHAP:NADPH reductase increase during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the ether-bond synthesizing peroxisomal alkyl-DHAP synthase is not. Examination of the properties and subcellular localization of DHAPAT and GPAT demonstrate that nonspecificity of GPAT contributes only a small portion of DHAPAT activity. These data are consistent with a role of the acyl-DHAP pathway in creation of the GP backbone required for biosynthesis of triacylglycerol and other glycerolipids. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured and induced to differentiate as described (18.Hemati N. Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Groblewski G.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25913-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested from plates by removing the media and washing once with ice-cold homogenizing medium (0.25 msucrose, 10 mm TES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA), and then suspending them in 1 ml of ice-cold homogenizing medium. Suspended cells were homogenized in a ball homogenizer (19.Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and then centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min to remove the unbroken cells and debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h and the sediment containing the subcellular organelles was suspended in 0.25 m sucrose in 10 mm TES (pH 7.5) and stored frozen in small aliquots at −70 °C. Activities of the enzymes were measured in particulate fractions that had been thawed once only. For subcellular fractionation the freshly isolated total particulate suspension was layered onto a 20–50% Accudenz (from Accurate Chemical Co., previously called Nycodenz) density gradient and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 70 min as described (20.Burdett K. Larkins L.K. Das A.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12201-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After fractionation enzymes and protein were assayed (20.Burdett K. Larkins L.K. Das A.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12201-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DHA32P and G32P were prepared by the enzymatic (glycerokinase, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone and glycerol, respectively, by [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biochemicals) (21.Jones K.M. Hajra A.K. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 946-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). DHAPAT and GPAT were assayed as described for the assay of DHAPAT (15.Webber K.O. Hajra A.K. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase and alkyl-DHAP synthase were assayed as described (22.Hajra A.K. Datta S.C. Ghosh M.K. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 209: 402-407Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 23.Horie S. Das A.K. Hajra A.K. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 209: 385-390Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For inhibition studies, the particulate fraction (0.5–1.0 mg of protein) in 1 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer was incubated on ice with different concentrations of NEM or MMTS for 15 min, and then aliquots were taken from this mixture to assay for DHAPAT and GPAT at 37 °C. For the heat denaturation studies the suspended organelles in 25 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) were heated at 50 °C and aliquots were removed at different time periods and chilled immediately in ice water. Samples were assayed for DHAPAT and GPAT activity at 37 °C. The trypsin treatment was as described (20.Burdett K. Larkins L.K. Das A.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12201-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Catalase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and succinate-cytochrome c reductase were assayed as described (20.Burdett K. Larkins L.K. Das A.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12201-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was assayed by the dye-binding method (24.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using reagent from Pierce Biochemicals. For the radioactive glucose incorporation experiments, adipocytes in 100-mm culture dishes were maintained overnight in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's M13 medium. On the day of the experiment, the medium was replaced with 5 ml of the same medium containing 100 μCi of d-[3-3H]glucose (10.8 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products Inc.) and 25 μCi ofd-[U-14C]glucose (13.9 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products Inc.). The cells were incubated with the radioactive substrate for 1 h at 37 °C in air with gentle shaking and the medium was removed. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and were then removed from the plate in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. After sonic disruption of the cells at 4 °C with a Branson sonic probe (model LS-75), the homogenate was subjected to a chloroform-methanol extraction procedure as described (25.Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5149-5154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After solvent partition, GP was isolated from the aqueous layer using a combination of ion-exchange and enzymatic methods (25.Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5149-5154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triglycerides (TG) and individual phospholipids were isolated from the organic layer by thin-layer chromatography (26.Lee C. Hajra A.K. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). TG was subjected to alkaline methanolysis and the glycerol moiety released was isolated (27.Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1617-1622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3H and 14C present in each carbon of glycerol were determined by periodate oxidation as described (25.Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5149-5154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, one-half of the glycerol was oxidized directly with IO4− and the formaldehyde formed from C-1 + C-3 was quantitatively converted to water-insoluble Dimedone (5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione from Sigma) adduct, which was separated from the water-soluble formic acid (formed from C-2) by toluene extraction (25.Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5149-5154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other half of the glycerol was enzymatically converted to GP (25.Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5149-5154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was oxidized with periodate when only C-1 is converted to HCHO, which was separated as Dimedone adduct from the water-soluble glycoaldehyde phosphate (C-2 + C-3) as above. The major phospholipids PE and PC were hydrolyzed by phospholipase D to diacylglycerol (26.Lee C. Hajra A.K. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the glycerol moiety of diacylglycerol was isolated and degraded as described for TG. The glycerol backbone of the ethanolamine plasmalogen was isolated as described (25.Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5149-5154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the radioactivity in the plasmalogen glycerol was very low, the liberated glycerol was directly degraded and the distribution of radioactivity in C-2 and combined C-1 + C-3 was determined. The completeness of degradation was verified by calculating the distribution of 14C which was uniform in all three carbons of glycerol. Total RNA from cells was isolated and subjected to formaldehyde gel electrophoretic separation and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described (18.Hemati N. Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Groblewski G.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25913-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The template DNA used for making the32P-probe was a 472-base pair (−74 to +398) mouse DHAPAT cDNA fragment from a mouse DHAPAT EST clone (number W54198, Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). After washings (18.Hemati N. Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Groblewski G.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25913-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) the radioactivity on the blots was detected using a Cyclone PhosphorImager (Packard Instruments) and autoradiography. The activity of acyl-DHAP pathway enzymes (Fig.1) and GPAT in the total particulate fraction of 3T3-L1 cells was assayed during a time course of adipogenesis (Fig. 2). As reported before (7.Kuri-Harcuch W. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2158-2160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Coleman R.A. Reed B.C. Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Lane M.D. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7256-7261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Grimaldi P. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the specific activity of GPAT increases during differentiation by about 6.5-fold in 6 days. During adipogenesis, the activities of DHAPAT measured at both pH 7.5 and 5.5 increase by 9- and 6.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 2). The activity of acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase increases, after an initial lag of 2 days, to about 5-fold in 6 days. In this period, the activity of catalase, the marker enzyme for microperoxisomes in these cells (4.Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) also increases by about 7-fold. However, during the same period the specific activity of alkyl-DHAP synthase, the enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of the ether bond, decreases by about 60%. These results indicate that, as in other mammalian cells (11.Hajra A.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), DHAPAT is active both at pH 7.5 and pH 5.5 (7.8 milliunits/mg of protein at pH 5.5 compared with 8.4 milliunits/mg at pH 7.5) in adipocytes 6 days after differentiation is induced. As expected (11.Hajra A.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28.Jones C.L. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8289-8295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GPAT has high activity at pH 7.5 (24.8 milliunits/mg of protein) and is inactive at pH 5.5. This indicates that peroxisomal DHAPAT is induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and DHAPAT activity in adipocytes is not due to the dual activity of GPAT. We further verified this by investigating the inhibition of these acyltransferases by sulfhydryl group-reacting agents like NEM and MMTS (11.Hajra A.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28.Jones C.L. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8289-8295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Monroy G. Rola F.H. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6884-6894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Bates E.J. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1979; 182: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31.Webber K.O. Carter B.D. Datta N.S. Hajra A.K. Fed. Proc. 1987; 46: 2106Google Scholar). In contrast to DHAPAT, GPAT is completely inhibited by both NEM and MMTS at low concentrations of the inhibitors (Fig.3 A). GPAT is also found to be more heat labile than DHAPAT (Fig. 3 B). Sensitivity of these acyltransferases to proteases has been widely used to distinguish between them. Microsomal GPAT is localized on the cytosolic surface of ER vesicles (32.Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 49: 459-487Crossref Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and is highly susceptible to proteolysis. Peroxisomal DHAPAT, localized on the lumenal side of peroxisomes, is comparatively resistant to proteolysis (20.Burdett K. Larkins L.K. Das A.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12201-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Jones C.L. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8289-8295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results (Fig. 3 C) show that the induced 3T3-L1 GPAT is very sensitive to trypsin treatment but most of DHAPAT is not, indicating that these two activities are not due to the dual activity of the same enzyme. The 30% DHAPAT which is labile to trypsin is probably due to the presence of damaged peroxisomes and also partly due to the nonspecificity of GPAT (see later). We have found that the properties of the induced GPAT are as described for the ER membrane-bound enzyme and that the properties of the induced DHAPAT are the same as those of the peroxisomal enzyme. The parallel increase in the catalase activity (Fig. 2) shows that peroxisomes are also induced during differentiation, thus verifying previous morphological observations (4.Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To establish that DHAPAT in these cells is indeed peroxisomal, density gradient centrifugation was used to separate peroxisomes from other organelles (20.Burdett K. Larkins L.K. Das A.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12201-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Hajra A.K. Bishop J.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 34.Hajra A.K. Wu D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, instead of using an enriched peroxisomal fraction (L fraction) the total particulate fraction was used so that the distribution of the enzymes in all extranuclear organelles can be analyzed in a single gradient. As seen in Fig. 4, the microperoxisomes (catalase-containing organelles) sediment to the bottom part of the tubes, while mitochondria (marker enzyme succinate-cytochromec reductase) and ER vesicles (marker enzyme NADPH-cytochromec reductase) remain higher in the gradient. The sedimentation pattern of DHAPAT, measured at both pH 7.5 and 5.5, follows that of catalase, indicating that DHAPAT is mainly localized in microperoxisomes. In contrast, GPAT follows the same profile as NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, indicating that GPAT is localized in ER. Acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase is mainly localized in peroxisomes; however, as in other organs, this enzyme is also present in ER as well as in mitochondria (Fig. 4). The human DHAPAT cDNA has been cloned (16.Thai T.P. Heid H. Rackwitz H.R. Hunziker A. Gorgas K. Just W.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,17.Ofman R. Hattema E.H. Hogenbaut E.M. Caruso U. Muijsers A.O. Wanders R.J. Human Mol. Gen. 1998; 7: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and a number of human and mouse EST clones are available. One EST clone (W54198) was used for Northern blot analysis of the DHAPAT mRNA in 3T3-L1 cells during differentiation. A number of such analyses reveal a 3–5-fold increase in the ∼3.0 kilobases (16.Thai T.P. Heid H. Rackwitz H.R. Hunziker A. Gorgas K. Just W.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17.Ofman R. Hattema E.H. Hogenbaut E.M. Caruso U. Muijsers A.O. Wanders R.J. Human Mol. Gen. 1998; 7: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) DHAPAT mRNA during adipogenesis (Fig.5). Thus the induction of DHAPAT activity during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes can be largely accounted for by an increase in DHAPAT mRNA. To investigate the proportion of non-ether lipids formed in these cells via the acyl-DHAP pathway, we measured the incorporation of radioactivity in each carbon of the glycerol moiety of GP and glycerolipids fromd-[3-3H, U-14C]glucose. The methods used, the assumptions made, and the calculations involved have been described (25.Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5149-5154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tritium and carbon flow pathways from labeled glucose to the glycerol moiety of lipids are summarized in Fig.6. Briefly, a part of the 3H from the labeled glucose will be transferred via the pentose phosphate pathway to the 4-position of NADPH which is reductant for the acyl-DHAP pathway but not for the GP pathway (Fig. 1). Although NADPH is mainly believed to be formed via malic enzyme in 3T3-L1 cells (6.Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), the pentose phosphate pathway is also present in these cells (35.Shantz L.M. Talalay P. Gordon G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3852-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We found a 3-fold increase in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity during differentiation of these cells (data not shown). The major portion of the 3H, however, will be at the C-1 of DHAP (hence also in C-1 of GP) generated from the labeled glucose via glycolysis. This pro-R 3H at C-1 of DHAP is stereospecifically exchanged with the proton of water during the formation of the ether bond (11.Hajra A.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). From the labeling scheme in Fig. 6, it is evident that the relative amount of 3H present at the C-2 of the glycerol moiety of the lipids compared with that of GP (0% formed via the acyl-DHAP pathway) and glycerol ether lipids (100% formed via the acyl-DHAP pathway) will be a measure of the fraction of the lipid formed via the acyl-DHAP pathway. Simultaneous use of [U-14C]glucose normalizes the variable 3H incorporation, so that a comparison of 3H/14C at C-2 will be a measure of the relative rate of incorporation of 3H via NADPH at this carbon. Both 3H (2–3%) and 14C (4–5%) from the labeled glucose were incorporated into adipocyte lipids. In TableI the distribution of 3H in each carbon of the glycerol moiety of GP, TG, PC, PE, and PE plasmalogens (pPE) is given. Two separate culture dishes were analyzed, and results are presented as either the average of three (for GP and TG) or two (for PC, PE, and pPE) determinations. As seen in Table I, compared with GP, relatively more 3H is present in the C-2 of the glycerol moiety of all the lipids. A ratio calculation, assuming 0% of GP and 100% of plasmalogenic glycerol, are synthesized via the acyl-DHAP pathway, was made to estimate the fraction of the lipids formed via the acyl-DHAP pathway (25.Pollock R.J.

For example, the3H/14C ratios at C-2 of GP, TG, and pPE glycerol are 0.05, 0.41, and 0.87, respectively (Table I). Therefore, subtracting the value for GP, the fraction of TG formed via the acyl-DHAP pathway is (0.41–0.05)/(0.87–0.05) = 0.439. Such calculations show that about 44% TG, 36% PC, and 19% PE of the newly (1 h) synthesized lipids are formed via the acyl-DHAP pathway in these cells. These results indicate that besides being formed from diacylglycerol, PC and PE are probably also formed via alternate pathways, e.g. PC by methylation of PE and PE via the decarboxylation of PS.Table IDistribution of 3 H in the glycerol moietyPositionGPTGPCPEpPEC-199.0%95.2%96.4%97.2%2.1%aC-1 + C-3.C-20.8%4.5%3.4%2.5%97.9%C-30.2%0.3%0.2%0.2%3H/14C at C-20.05 ± 0.010.41 ± 0.060.350.21%0.87Typical distributions of 3H from d-[3-3H, U-14C]glucose into each of the glycerol carbon of GP and of different glycerolipids are shown.

Both peroxisomal DHAPAT and microsomal GPAT are induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. A small fraction of the DHAPAT activity might be due to the nonspecific action of GPAT as seen in the initial drop in DHAPAT at low NEM or MMTS concentrations (Fig.3 A). By extrapolating the values in this figure to zero inhibitor, it may be surmised that 10–20% of DHAPAT (4–7% of GPAT) activity is due to GPAT using hydrated DHAP as substrate (11.Hajra A.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The increase in the peroxisomal DHAPAT activity is largely due to gene expression, since the amount of DHAPAT mRNA is also increased during differentiation (Fig. 5). This is the first report that along with the induction of lipogenic ER enzymes, peroxisomal lipogenic enzymes are also induced during the conversion of preadipocytes to adipocytes. These findings agree well with the morphological observation that microperoxisomes are induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (4.Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and with the reported high DHAPAT activity, highest among all other tissues, in rat adipose tissue (36.LaBelle Jr., E.F. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5835-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of another enzyme of the acyl-DHAP pathway,i.e. acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase, was also found to increase by 5-fold during differentiation. This reductase is also high in adipose tissue (37.LaBelle Jr., E.F. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5825-5834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the specific activity of alkyl-DHAP synthase, the peroxisomal enzyme catalyzing the ether bond synthesis was found to decrease by 60% in this time period. Considering that the protein content of the cells also increases by 2-fold during this time period (8.Coleman R.A. Reed B.C. Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Lane M.D. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7256-7261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the total activity of the synthase per cell appears to remain constant. Coleman and Bell (10.Coleman R.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7681-7687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported about a 2-fold increase in the reductase activity, but could not detect any alkyl-DHAP synthase activity in these cells. We found by using two-dimensional reaction thin-layer chromatography (38.Das A.K. Hajra A.K. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2706-2714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the cellular content of the ether lipid plasmalogens as a fraction of total phospholipids is fairly high which remains almost unchanged (9.3% at day 0 versus 8.1% at day 6) during differentiation. Confirming reports by others (7.Kuri-Harcuch W. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2158-2160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Coleman R.A. Reed B.C. Mackall J.C. Student A.K.

Biochem. 1978; 84: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we also found a strong induction of GPAT during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Although Jerkinset al. (39.Jerkins A.A. Liu R.W. Lee S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1416-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and Ericsson et al. (40.Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) reported a significant increase (up to 8-fold) in mitochondrial GPAT mRNA during differentiation of these cells, we found that most of the induced GPAT seems to be microsomal because very little of it is insensitive to NEM (Fig. 3). Yet et al. (41.Yet S.F. Moon Y.K. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7303-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) found in differentiated cells that the specific activity of the NEM-insensitive mitochondrial GPAT was only 7% of that of microsomal GPAT. Considering that the cellular content of microsomal protein is much more than that of mitochondria (42.deDuve C. Beaufay H. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 2935-2995Google Scholar), it may be concluded that the contribution of mitochondrial GPAT to total GPAT in these cells is negligible. This is also seen in the subcellular fractionation data presented in Fig. 4. The GPAT activity in these fractions followed the microsomal marker enzyme (NADPH-cytochrome c reductase) profile with no enrichment of the GPAT activity in the mitochondrial fractions (marker enzyme succinate-cytochrome c reductase). It is not obvious why both the microsomal and the peroxisomal pathways are induced during differentiation of these cells. While ER contains the enzymes necessary for conversion of GP to TG or phospholipids, the end product of the peroxisomal pathway, i.e.lysophosphatidate, must be exported to ER for conversion to these lipids (11.Hajra A.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is possible that the lysophosphatidic acid is channeled toward making membrane lipids whereas TG is synthesized via the GP pathway. During differentiation there is an increase in the intracellular membranous organelles such as ER and microperoxisomes (43.Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and a 2–3-fold increase in activity of the phosphoglyceride biosynthetic enzymes (8.Coleman R.A. Reed B.C. Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Lane M.D. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7256-7261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have estimated the contribution of the acyl-DHAP pathway to the synthesis of non-ether lipids by determining the incorporation of 3H fromd-[3-3H, U-14C]glucose into C-2 of the glycerolipids (25.Pollock R.J. Hajra A.K. Agranoff B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5149-5154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and from the relative enrichment of3H at this position it is estimated that almost half of the TG is synthesized via acyl-DHAP in these adipocytes (Table I). From these results and from the morphological observations of Novikoff and co-workers (4.Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 43.Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that after differentiation the fat droplets in these cells are surrounded by microperoxisomes and ER, it may be surmised that both pathways are utilized for the synthesis of TG. It should be pointed out that carbon flow through the pathways is controlled not only by the activity of the enzymes, but also availability of substrates and cofactors (11.Hajra A.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A major difference between these pathways is the requirement of the reduced pyridine nucleotide coenzyme (Fig. 1). In general, the cellular concentration of NADPH is much higher than that of NADH (44.Voet G. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. J. Wiley and Sons, New York1995: 617Google Scholar), and NADPH synthesis via the malic enzyme in 3T3-L1 cells is highly increased during differentiation (6.Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Thus the cellular NADPH/NADH ratio probably controls the relative contribution of these two pathways for TG biosynthesis. Although all three enzymes of the acyl-DHAP pathway are localized on peroxisomal membranes and the alkyl-DHAP synthase may be associated with DHAPAT (45.Biermann J. Just W.W. Wanders R.J. Van Den Bosch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), they are regulated independently. The findings that peroxisomal DHAPAT and acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase, but not the alkyl-DHAP synthase, are induced and that there is no increase in cellular ether lipid content support the conclusion that non-ether lipids are being synthesized in the adipocytes via the acyl-DHAP pathway (Fig. 1). These findings also agree with past results comparing lipid biosynthetic pathways (11.Hajra A.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and also with a recent report that an acyl/alkyl reductase deficiency leads to impaired non-ether PC synthesis (46.James P.F. Lake A.C. Hajra A.K. Larkins L.K. Robinson M. Buchanan F.G. Zoeller R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23540-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the general consensus is that this peroxisomal pathway is solely for the biosynthesis of ether lipids (13.Kennedy E.P. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Roelofsen B. Wirtz K.W.A. Lipids and Membranes: Past, Present and Future. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1986: 171-206Google Scholar). This assumption is based on the fact that there is a deficiency of ether lipids, but not other glycerolipids, in the tissues of patients suffering from congenital peroxisomal disorders (47.Heymans H.S.A. Schutgens R.B.H. Tan R. van den Bosch H. Borst P. Nature. 1983; 306: 69-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), where there is also a deficiency of DHAPAT (48.Datta N.S. Wilson G.N. Hajra A.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 311: 1080-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a complete loss of GPD, in a mutant mouse strain does not affect the animal's physiological functions (49.Prochazka M. Kozak U.C. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4679-4683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GPD is also absent in many fast growing tumor cells, but lipid synthesis proceeds in these cells at a high rate (50.Hajra A.K. Wood R. Tumor Lipids. American Oil Chemists' Society, Champaign, IL1973: 183-199Google Scholar). It seems that because in mammals there are three routes,i.e. mitochondrial and microsomal GPAT and peroxisomal acyl-DHAP pathways, for the synthesis of cellular lysophosphatidate, the precursor of all non-ether glycerolipids, the impairment of one pathway is compensated for by increased activity of other pathways. Thus, 3T3-L1 adipocytes are a good system to study not only the mechanism of regulation of the peroxisomal pathway by hormones, but also to resolve the question of the physiological role of the peroxisomal lipid biosynthetic pathway."

The molecular events involved in clearance of apoptotic cells are just beginning to be elucidated. Recently, CED-6, an adapter protein involved in engulfment has been cloned inCaenorhabditis elegans and in humans. CED-6 is composed of a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain and a proline-rich C-terminal domain with no apparent catalytic domain. Since PTB domains, originally identified in Shc, mediate intracellular signaling downstream of cell surface receptors, CED-6 has also been proposed to mediate intracellular signals leading to engulfment. In this report, we demonstrate that CED-6 dimerizes through a leucine zipper domain that is immediately adjacent to the PTB domain. Several lines of evidence based on co-immunoprecipitation studies, yeast two-hybrid assays, and gel filtration studies suggest that CED-6 exists as a dimer in vivo. Through mutational analyses, we show that the leucine zipper is necessary and sufficient for CED-6 dimerization and that this dimerization is conserved among C. elegans, rodent, and human CED-6 proteins. We propose that dimerization may have unique implications for ligand binding via CED-6 and its function during the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.

Lambie E. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Hengartner M.O. Development. 1999; 126: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearance of dead cells is mediated by professional phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as by nonprofessional phagocytes within certain tissues (2.Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 3.Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 365-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Removal of apoptotic cells occurs very rapidly in vivo and helps to prevent secondary necrosis and the release of potentially harmful contents from dying cells (5.Fadok V.A. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In humans, the failure to properly remove apoptotic cells has been implicated in certain types of chronic inflammation. Engulfment of apoptotic cells is mediated by the recognition of specific markers on dying cells by receptors on the phagocytic cells (6.Savill J. Br. Med. Bull. 1997; 53: 491-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 7.Platt N. da Silva R.P. Gordon S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The subsequent intracellular signals delivered within the phagocyte through these recognition receptors are thought to mediate the cytoskeletal rearrangement and the uptake of apoptotic cells. Although several surface receptors involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells have been recognized, very little is known about intracellular signaling mediated by these receptors and the precise molecular events regulating the execution of engulfment (2.Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 4.Platt N. da Silva R.P. Gordon S.

Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have identified at least six genes that are involved in clearance of apoptotic cells (1.Gumienny T.L. Lambie E. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Hengartner M.O. Development. 1999; 126: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Horvitz H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 (Suppl. 7): 1701s-1706sGoogle Scholar). These six genes fall into two partially redundant complementation groups and include ced-1,ced-6, and ced-7 in one group andced-2, ced-5, and ced-10 in another (9.Ellis R.E. Jacobson D.M. Horvitz H.R. Genetics. 1991; 129: 79-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cloning of the ced-6 gene by Liu and Hengartner (10.Liu Q.A. Hengartner M.O. Cell. 1998; 93: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) showed that the ceCED-61protein resembles an adapter protein with an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich region with no apparent catalytic domain. The CED-6 PTB domain is highly homologous to the “classical” PTB domains originally identified in other mammalian signaling proteins such as Shc. PTB domains of proteins such as Shc, Numb, FE65, and X11 have been shown to mediate protein-protein as well as protein-phospholipid interactions (11.Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 12.Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol.

Med. 1996; 128: 235-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because many PTB domain-containing proteins have been shown to function downstream of cell surface receptors, it was proposed that CED-6 may function as a signaling adapter protein during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (10.Liu Q.A. Hengartner M.O. Cell. 1998; 93: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recently, the human and Drosophila homologues ofced-6 have also been cloned (15.Liu Q.A. Hengartner M.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1347-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16.Smits E. Criekinge W.V. Plaetinck G. Bogaert T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1351-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid sequences of C. elegans, Drosophila, and human CED-6 proteins demonstrates that the N-terminal PTB domain is evolutionarily conserved, whereas the C-terminal proline-rich sequences are less well conserved (16.Smits E. Criekinge W.V. Plaetinck G. Bogaert T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1351-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since the overall domain organization of these proteins are the same, this suggested an evolutionarily conserved function for CED-6. Consistent with this, overexpression of hCED-6 in J774 cells led to enhanced phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (16.Smits E. Criekinge W.V. Plaetinck G. Bogaert T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1351-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of hCED-6 partially rescued the defect in apoptotic cell clearance in worms lacking a functional ceCED-6 protein (15.Liu Q.A. Hengartner M.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1347-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although these data clearly suggest a role for hCED-6 in engulfment of apoptotic cells, precisely how CED-6 functions during engulfment is not yet understood. At present, the ligands of CED-6 are not known. It is believed that CED-6, via its PTB domain, may interact with ligands (most likely at the membrane) and that through other protein-protein interactions, via its C terminus, CED-6 would mediate downstream signaling leading to phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. In this report, we identify and characterize a leucine zipper domain immediately C-terminal to the CED-6 PTB domain. Several lines of evidence indicate that this leucine zipper (LZ) domain mediates dimerization of CED-6 and that the LZ-dependent dimerization is evolutionarily conserved in CED-6 proteins from worm to humans. Since such leucine zipper domains are not seen in other proteins containing PTB domains such as Shc, this dimerization is likely to have unique implications for ligand binding via CED-6 and its signaling function during engulfment of apoptotic cells. All hCED-6 constructs were obtained by PCR and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vectors pEBG (for expression as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein) and pEBB-HA (for expression of hemagglutinin (HA) tagged proteins) using 5′-NdeI and 3′-NotI restriction sites (17.Lamkin T.D.

The original template for hced-6 has been described (16.Smits E. Criekinge W.V. Plaetinck G. Bogaert T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1351-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). TheNdeI site within the coding sequence of the original hced-6 clone was destroyed by a silent mutation using a PCR-based mutagenesis strategy. The internal primers used were 5′-GAT AAA ACT GAC AAG AGG ATA TTC ACT TTC ATT TGC AAA GAT TCT GAG TCA AAT AAA CAT TTG-3′ and 5′-CAA ATG TTT ATT TGA CTC AGA ATC TTT GCA AAT GAA AGT GAA TAT CCT CTT GTC AGT TTT ATC-3′.

COS-7 cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's recommendation. All transient transfections were performed using 2–5 μg of the appropriate expression plasmid. LR73 cells were stably transfected by the calcium phosphate method. Briefly, 20 μg of the appropriate expression plasmid (linearized with SphI), was co-transfected with 0.5 μg of puromycin resistance gene-expressing pApuro plasmid (linearized with NotI), as a selection marker. Cells were plated at different concentrations in growth media containing 7 μg/ml of puromycin, and single clones were isolated for further studies. Cells were lysed on the tissue culture plates with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, AEBSF, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% Nonidet P-40). GST-tagged proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-HA immunoprecipitations were performed with using 12CA5 supernatant or H-7 anti-HA antibodies pre-bound to protein A or protein A-protein G-agarose conjugates (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Precipitates were washed four times with buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 μm each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, AEBSF, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Antibodies for Western blotting HA and GST-tagged proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Antibody EP990445 to hCED-6 was generated by immunizing rabbits with a peptide corresponding to amino acids 31–44 from hCED-6. Monoclonal anti-Grb2 and anti-Shc antibodies were obtained from Transduction Labs (Lexington, KY). All immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The two-hybrid system was purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). hced-6 was cloned in frame of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (pAS2) and GAL4 activation domain (pGAD424) as aNdeI-SalI fragment. The cloning was verified by DNA sequencing. Transformation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain HF7c was done by the lithium acetate method according to the manufacturer's directions. Yeast colonies carrying putative interacting proteins were selected by growth on synthetic minimal media lacking tryptophan, leucine, adenine, and histidine in the presence of 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4,-triazole (Sigma) and by screening for β-galactosidase activity in a filter assay using as a substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Saxon Biochemicals, Hanover, Germany). Proteins were separated on a 20-ml column of Sephadex G-75 (Sigma) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. 2 × 107 LR73 cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer, filtered through a 0.22-μm spin filter (Fisher), and loaded onto the column. The first 4 ml of void volume was discarded. 50 fractions containing 500 μl were collected. Fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. As part of our studies to understand human CED-6 function during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, we generated hCED-6 constructs carrying two different epitope tags (HA-tagged or GST-tagged hCED-6) and expressed them transiently in COS-7 cells. Following glutathione-Sepharose (GSH) precipitation, we observed that the HA-tagged hCED-6 was precipitated with GST-tagged hCED-6 as determined by anti-HA immunoblotting (Fig.1). In the same experiment, the GST tag alone did not precipitate the HA-hCED-6. Conversely, immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged hCED-6 (with anti-HA antibodies) co-precipitated the GST-tagged hCED-6 (see Fig. 5 below). These data suggested that hCED-6 proteins can form dimers/oligomers in cells. Expression of these proteins in 293T cells yielded similar results (data not shown).Figure 5hCED-6 does not cross-dimerize with ceCED-6. GST-tagged hCED-6 and ceCED-6 were co-expressed with HA-tagged hCED-6 and ceCED-6. Following anti-HA immunoprecipitation co-precipitated GST-tagged proteins were detected with anti-GST immunoblotting. GST-ceCED-6 was only co-precipitated by HA-ceCED-6 (lane 2). Likewise, GST-hCED-6 was only co-precipitated by HA-hCED-6 (lane 3). Comparable HA-CED-6 was precipitated in all lanes (left bottom panel). Expression of the transfected proteins in total lysates is shown in lanes 7–10(right panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also tested hCED-6 for self-interaction in a yeast two-hybrid assay. hCED-6 was cloned into appropriate yeast two-hybrid plasmids and expressed as a fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4-BD) or GAL4 activation domain (GAL4-AD). After transformation of appropriate yeast strain with these plasmids, the ability of yeast to grow on histidine-deficient media and β-galactosidase enzyme activity were tested (both of which are dependent on the interaction between the two hCED-6 fusion proteins). As shown in TableI, although GAL4-BD or Gal4-AD alone fused to hCED-6 were not sufficient, co-expression of the two constructs provided His auxotrophy and β-galactosidase activity. These data again suggest that hCED-6 can also dimerize in the heterologous yeast system.Table IInteraction of hCED-6 in a yeast two-hybrid assayGAL4-DNA-binding domain fusionGAL4-activation domain fusionHistidine auxotrophyβ-Galactosidase activityhCED-6None−−NonehCED-6−−hCED-6hCED-6++++++p53None−−NoneSV40-Large T Ag−−p53SV40-Large T Ag++++The cloning of hCED-6 into the yeast two-hybrid plasmids and the screening procedure for hybrid formation are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The histidine auxotrophy was assessed by growth on histidine deficient media, and the β-galactosidase reporter gene activity was measured by a filter assay using X-gal.

By aligning the predicted PTB regions of hCED-6 with Shc, we observed that the PTB domain of hCED-6 appears to end at amino acid 150 (which corresponds to amino acid 204 of human p52Shc, consistent with the C terminus of the Shc-PTB domain determined by NMR). However, comparison of CED-6 protein sequence among the different species indicated that a high degree of homology exists up to amino acid 200 of hCED-6. Interestingly, the region between amino acid 150 and 200 of hCED-6 contains four leucines that are spaced seven residues apart, a feature characteristic of leucine zippered coiled-coil domains (19.Alber T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Previously, leucine zipper domains have been identified in many transcription factors and a few cytoplasmic proteins and have been found to play a role in dimerization/multimerization of proteins (19.Alber T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that hCED-6 could dimerize/oligomerize through this leucine zipper like sequence. To better characterize the putative LZ region, we analyzed the sequences of hCED-6 and ceCED-6 through the program, Multicoil (20.Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). This program accurately predicts the oligomerization state of protein sequences based on the position of specific hydrophobic and charged amino acids as well as pairwise residue interactions. As shown in Fig.2 A, the Multicoil program predicted the existence of a coiled-coil domain capable of forming a parallel side-by-side homodimer in both hCED-6 and ceCED-6. This coiled-coil is immediately C-terminal to the PTB domain homology. Analysis of a number of other PTB domain-containing proteins such as Shc, Numb, and Dab-1 in the Multicoil program failed to show a similar coiled-coil motif in these other proteins. The alignment of the human and ceCED-6 leucine zipper region and the key features of the sequence are shown in Fig. 2 B. Helical wheel representation of the hCED-6 coiled-coil showed that the four heptad leucines align correctly in a side-by-side dimer of hCED-6 molecules and that specifically spaced hydrophobic residues create a hydrophobic surface that can mediate dimerization (Fig. 2 C). To determine whether the predicted leucine zipper region is necessary and sufficient for dimerization of hCED-6, we generated a series of hCED-6 constructs with deletions or point mutations. These constructs are schematically shown in Fig.3 A. Based on the Multicoil prediction, the dimerization region extended between amino acids 147 and 202. We tested whether this region alone, expressed as a GST-tagged protein would be capable of dimerizing with HA-tagged full-length hCED-6. GST-tagged 147–202 was co-expressed with HA-hCED-6 in COS cells and precipitated with GSH beads, and the co-precipitation of HA-hCED-6 was analyzed by anti-HA immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.3 B, the 147–202 region alone was sufficient to dimerize with full-length hCED-6. Although the predicted dimerization sequence shows a shoulder of probability starting from amino acid 147, the region of highest likelihood is restricted to residues 162–200, which includes the heptad leucines. When we tested a GST-tagged protein encoding the region 162–202, this construct precipitated HA-hCED-6 as efficiently as GST-147–202 or GST-tagged full-length hCED-6. These data suggested that the predicted coiled-coil/leucine zipper region is sufficient to mediate dimerization between human CED-6 proteins. Although the above data indicated that the 162–202 region is sufficient for dimerization, it did not rule out the possibility that other regions may also contribute to dimerization between full-length hCED-6 proteins. To address this, GST-tagged constructs containing only the leucine zipper (GST-LZ), the PTB alone (GST-PTB), or the C terminus alone (GST-C-term) were individually co-transfected with HA-hCED-6. Following GSH precipitation, GST-PTB or the GST-C-term failed to co-precipitate the HA-hCED-6 protein, whereas the GST-LZ was able to do so (Fig. 3 C). As would be expected from these results, GST-PTB+LZ was also capable of dimerizing with HA-hCED-6 (Fig.3 B, lane 4). To further characterize the importance of the leucine zipper region in the dimerization of the full-length hCED-6 and to determine the requirement for the leucines, we mutated the two central leucines to prolines (L176P/L183P) to disrupt the helical structure. Full-length GST-tagged hCED-6 containing the two point mutations (L176P/L183P) was co-expressed with HA-tagged hCED-6. The mutant failed to co-precipitate the HA-hCED-6, indicating that the dimerization with the wild type protein was abrogated by the L176P/L183P mutation (Fig. 3 D). Taken together, the above data indicate that the leucine zipper region between amino acids 162–202 of hCED-6 is necessary and sufficient for dimerization. Since a homologous leucine zipper region is also observed in the ceCED-6 sequence, we hypothesized that the dimerization of CED-6 via the leucine zipper may be evolutionarily conserved. To test this, we generated constructs encoding GST-tagged and HA-tagged ceCED-6 (Fig.4 A) and co-expressed them in 293T cells. Following immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies, the co-precipitation of GST-ceCED-6 was analyzed by anti-GST immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4 B, HA-tagged ceCED-6 precipitated the GST-tagged ceCED-6 but not the control GST-Shc. When one or more leucines within the leucine zipper domain were mutated to prolines (L215P (lane 4) and L208P/L215P (lane 5)), the co-precipitation of GST-tagged ceCED-6 with HA-tagged ceCED-6 was abolished. These data demonstrate that the ceCED-6 protein also dimerizes through the LZ domain. Since it appeared that the LZ-dependent dimerization of CED-6 is evolutionarily conserved, we tested whether hCED-6 would be capable of dimerizing with ceCED-6. To explore this possibility, we co-expressed either HA-tagged or GST-tagged hCED-6 with the oppositely tagged GST or HA-ceCED-6 in 293T cells. The lysates were precipitated with anti-HA antibodies, and the co-precipitation of the GST-tagged protein was determined by anti-GST immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.5, HA-tagged ceCED-6 was unable to cross-dimerize with GST-hCED-6 but was fully capable of dimerizing with GST-tagged ceCED-6. Likewise, hCED-6, although capable of dimerizing to itself, was unable to cross-dimerize with ceCED-6. These results underscore the high specificity for leucine zipper-dependent interactions in CED-6. In some experiments, after long exposure, we detected bands corresponding to ceCED-6 co-precipitating with hCED-6. Because these were extremely weak compared with the strong bands observed with CED-6 from the same species, we conclude that the cross-species interaction is not strong. The presence of a conserved leucine zipper domain from worms to humans suggested an evolutionarily important role for this domain in CED-6 function that may also be conserved in other species. Thus, we predicted that a similar dimerization also occurs in the rodent CED-6 protein. We have observed that the anti-human CED-6 antibodies (generated against a peptide sequence derived from the hCED-6 PTB domain) also recognized a protein in the hamster LR73 cell line with a molecular weight similar to that of the human protein (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the anti-hCED-6 antibodies do not cross-react with the ceCED-6 (data not shown). Based on this, we hypothesized that the rodent and human proteins are more closely related and that they may be able to cross-dimerize. This would also reveal the presence of a similar LZ domain, even though the hamster ced-6 gene has not yet been cloned. To test this possibility, we stably expressed GST-hCED-6 in LR73 cells. These cells were lysed and precipitated with GSH beads, and the co-precipitation of the endogenous hamster CED-6 was analyzed by anti-CED-6 immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.6 A, hamster CED-6 was found to co-precipitate with the GST-hCED-6 from transfected cells but was not precipitated from the parental LR73 cells. Expression of GST-LZ alone of hCED-6 in LR73 cells also co-precipitated the endogenous hamster CED-6 (data not shown). To further characterize the oligomeric state of endogenous hamster CED-6, lysates from parental untransfected LR73 cells were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. The fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of hamster CED-6 in the individual fractions was analyzed by anti-hCED-6 immunoblotting. If endogenous CED-6 in LR73 cells were to exist as a dimer in vivo and assuming a globular shape, this CED-6 protein would be expected to have a similar elution pattern as proteins of ∼70 kDa. As seen in Fig.6 B, the peak of hamster CED-6 was observed between fractions 12 and 13. In comparison, the adapter protein Grb2 (predicted molecular mass of 23 kDa) appears in fraction 20. In the same experiment, the peak of the different isoforms of Shc, p66, p52, and p48 were seen in fractions 13, 14/15, and 15, respectively. From these data, we conclude that the endogenous hamster CED-6 migrates closer to proteins of 65–70 kDa (rather than as the predicted 35-kDa monomeric form) and also exists as a dimer in vivo. In this report, we demonstrate that CED-6, an adapter protein involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, can form homodimersin vivo. This CED-6 leucine zipper is necessary and sufficient for dimerization between CED-6 proteins and is evolutionarily conserved from C. elegans to man. Our data suggest that CED-6 protein in rodents, although not yet cloned, also exists as a dimer in vivo and may contain a similar LZ domain involved in dimerization. To our knowledge, CED-6 is the only known PTB domain with a contiguous leucine zipper dimerization domain and suggests another possible mode of regulation for ligand binding through the PTB domains. Because the ligands for CED-6 are currently unknown and the signaling events involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells are just beginning to be elucidated, the dimerization demonstrated here has implications for regulation of engulfment by CED-6. The Multicoil program was designed to identify parallel coiled-coil structures and furthermore distinguish between potential dimers and trimers (20.Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The predictions are based on the location of certain types of amino acids in heptad repeats, with positions within the repeat being denoted as (abcdefg)n. The positions of characteristic hydrophobic residues in positions a andd and charged residues in positions e andg within the heptad determine the coiled-coil. Moreover, Multicoil considers the location and the pairwise interactions between the residues within the heptad to distinguish a given coiled-coil as a dimer or trimer (20.Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Based on this, the coiled-coil within both the hCED-6 and ceCED-6 proteins were classified as dimers. Although the shoulders of the coiled-coil regions of both human and C. elegans proteins were assigned some probability score for being a trimer, this is most likely an artifact of the algorithm in predicting multimerization at the shoulders of coiled-coils. 2P. Kim, personal communication. Moreover, the smaller “bumps” on the Multicoil prediction of the ceCED-6 around amino acids 100 and 450 are not considered significant because of the low probability scores. In addition, our mutational analyses of human and ceCED-6 demonstrated that the CED-6 dimerization is dependent on the leucine zipper motif. The helical wheel prediction provides further evidence for dimerization of the coiled-coil region of CED-6. The leucines and the hydrophobic residues are well aligned on one side of the coiled-coil, whereas the hydrophilic residues are distributed evenly throughout the rest of the coiled-coil. This again favors the formation of a dimer. Moreover, our size exclusion studies point to CED-6 being a dimer. Despite the caveats of size exclusion chromatography such as the globularversus elongated shape of the molecule, hamster CED-6 was present in fractions earlier than those in which p66 and p52 Shc proteins were seen. The Shc isoforms have a PTB domain and a proline-rich region analogous to CED-6 but do not have a leucine zipper region; our previous studies have also demonstrated that Shc exists only as a monomer (17.Lamkin T.D. Walk S.F. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. Ravichandran K.S. J Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 10396-10401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Taken together, we conclude that CED-6 proteins exist as dimers in vivo. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that higher order oligomers can form, possibly building on the basic block of the dimer. Since the gel filtration studies suggested that the majority of CED-6 existed in a homodimeric state, any hamster CED-6 that forms higher order oligomers would constitute a small fraction of the total population of hamster CED-6 that is too small to detect by immunoblotting. An interesting possibility is that higher order oligomers of rodent CED-6 may form during an activation event such as recognition of apoptotic cells or initiation of phagocytosis. It is noteworthy that although our data support a role for the leucine zipper of CED-6 in homodimerization, the results do not exclude heterodimerization with other LZ-containing proteins. The above possibilities are currently under investigation. Our data also demonstrate that the leucine zipper domain is necessary and sufficient for dimerization of CED-6 proteins. The isolated PTB domain or the C-terminal region were unable to co-precipitate full-length hCED-6, whereas the LZ alone was very efficient in co-precipitating full-length CED-6. In this regard, we observed that the quantity of HA-CED-6 precipitated by GST-tagged full-length CED-6 or GST-LZ was indistinguishable in many different experiments. Although we cannot rule out small contribution from other regions of CED-6 to dimerization of the native protein, these observations and our data that point mutations of the critical leucines in the LZ region abolishes the dimerization leads us to propose that the LZ domain is the primary, if not the only region involved in dimerization of CED-6. The interactions via the LZ of CED-6 also appeared quite specific. The failure of human or rodent CED-6 protein to dimerize with the worm protein or other PTB domain-containing proteins such as Shc supports this conclusion. We also observe that stable expression of ceCED-6 in LR73 cells, unlike human CED-6, fails to co-precipitate the endogenous hamster CED-6. 3E. Brugnera and K. S. Ravichandran, unpublished observations. The leucine zipper identified in the human and C. elegansCED-6 proteins and the data with endogenous hamster proteins suggest that the dimerization domain is evolutionarily conserved and is likely to be important for CED-6 function. Genetic studies strongly implied that CED-6 functions as a signaling adapter protein during engulfment of apoptotic cells (10.Liu Q.A. Hengartner M.O. Cell. 1998; 93: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Expression of human ced-6 transgene in worms carrying mutations of ced-6 partially rescued the defect in clearance of apoptotic bodies, suggesting that the mechanism of CED-6 function is conserved through evolution (15.Liu Q.A. Hengartner M.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1347-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the overall structural features of CED-6 are highly conserved in the different species with a PTB domain at its N terminus, followed by the LZ domain and then the C-terminal proline-rich domain. Although ligands for CED-6 remain to be identified, each of its three modules could potentially mediate interactions with ligands. Based on the known function of other PTB domains in binding to surface receptors, it is believed that the PTB domain would mediate interactions with surface receptors involved in phagocytosis, whereas the C-terminal proline-rich region would interact with intracellular signaling proteins and possibly regulate cytoskeletal reorganization during engulfment. We favor a model in which the PTB and C-terminal regions interact with ligands, whereas the leucine zipper mediates homodimerization of CED-6. The LZ-dependent dimerization may aid the binding of CED-6 to its ligands. For example, the ligand for the PTB domain may contain more than one PTB domain-binding site, and dimerization may facilitate CED-6 binding to such ligands. Alternatively, the affinity of the PTB domain for its ligand may be low, and dimerization may enhance such low affinity interactions. PTB domains have structural homology to pleckstrin homology domains and PTB domains of Shc and Dab-1 have been shown to bind phospholipids (21.Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5179-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 22.Ravichandran K.S. Zhou M.M. Pratt J.C. Harlan J.E. Walk S.F. Fesik S.W. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5540-5549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the affinity of PTB domains for phospholipids is lower than that for protein ligands (22.Ravichandran K.S. Zhou M.M. Pratt J.C. Harlan J.E. Walk S.F. Fesik S.W. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5540-5549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), the phospholipid interactions would be aided by binding through dimerized PTB domains. The dimerization of CED-6 may also improve its ability to bind to membrane proteins. Since many membrane receptors function through dimerization, it is possible that CED-6 binds to membrane receptors involved in phagocytosis after they dimerize. Alternatively, CED-6 may help to cluster receptors involved in phagocytosis, and this could be part of the mechanism of engulfment. Some of the surface receptors implicated in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells can form multimers (e.g. scavenger receptors) (24.Platt N. Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Kodama T. Gordon S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12456-12460Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 25.Platt N. da Silva R.P. Gordon S. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 65: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and further clustering of these already oligomerized receptors through CED-6 may be a mechanism involved in phagocytosis. Additionally, the C-terminal domain of CED-6 contains potential SH3-binding sites. SH3 interactions are generally low affinity interactions, and dimerization of CED-6 could allow proteins, which contain multiple SH3 domains, for example Grb2 and Crk, to bind with higher affinity. It is interesting to note that the large adapter protein Cbl, which contains a domain that interacts with phosphotyrosines, has been shown to dimerize through a leucine zipper domain, and this dimerization appears to be required for phosphorylation of Cbl (26.Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).

It is unknown at present how the activity of these enzymes is modulated in early carcinogenesis, to first build up the clear cell phenotype and then trigger its disappearance at later stages.

Virol. 1989; 63: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transforming activity of E7 is sensitive to mutations in the N-terminal domain (12.Phelps W.C. Yee C.L. Münger K. Howley P.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 539-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 13.Edmonds C. Vousden K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2650-2656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it was shown that the N-terminal part of the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein mediates binding to proteins of the retinoblastoma gene family (14.Dyson N. Howley P.M. Munger K. Harlow E. Science. 1989; 243: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). Therefore E7 triggers activation of cellular genes driven by the E2F transcription factor (15.Phelps W.C. Bagchi S. Barnes J.A. Raychaudhuri P. Kraus V. Münger K. Howley P.M. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6922-6930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the accumulation of cellular factors required for S phase entry (for review see Refs. 16.Reed S.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 151-153PubMed Google Scholar and 17.Nigg E.A. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). However, the ability of E7 to transform cells is also sensitive to mutations in the C-terminal domain (18.McIntyre M.C. Frattini M.G. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3142-3150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is of particular importance for the ability of E7 to immortalize human keratinocytes, the natural host cells of HPV-16 (19.Jewers R. Hildebrandt P. Ludlow J. Kell B. McCance D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas it was convincingly demonstrated that the interaction of E7 with nuclear proteins is essential for its transforming potential (reviewed in Ref.20.Alani R.M. Munger K. J. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 16: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), a substantial fraction of the total E7 protein is found in the cytoplasm (21.Smotkin D. Wettstein F.O. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1686-1689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Kanda T. Zanma S. Watanabe S. Furuno A. Yoshiike K. Virology. 1991; 182: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In accordance with these observations, it was found that several cellular proteins interact with the C terminus of HPV-16 E7 (23.Antinore M.J. Birrer M.J. Patel D. Nader L. Mccance D.J.

Mazurek S. Massimi P. Banks L. Eigenbrodt E. Jansen-Dürr P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), is localized in the cytoplasm. M2-PK plays a key role in reprogramming the cellular carbohydrate metabolism in tumors (for review see Ref. 29.Eigenbrodt E. Reinacher M. Scheefers B.U. Scheefers H. Friis R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1992; 3: 91-115PubMed Google Scholar), and it was shown that HPV-16 E7 shifts M2-PK to the tumor-specific dimeric form with decreased substrate affinity, resulting in the expansion of the intracellular pools of glycolytic phosphometabolites (28.Zwerschke W. Mazurek S. Massimi P. Banks L. Eigenbrodt E. Jansen-Dürr P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In an attempt to discover additional E7-binding proteins, we now identified the glycogen-degrading enzyme acid α-glucosidase as a new interaction partner for HPV-16 E7, and we found that its catalytic activity is directly controlled by the E7 protein. The C-terminal part of HPV-16 E7, fused in frame to the DNA-binding domain of LexA, was used as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid system (30.Zwerschke W. Joswig S. Jansen-Dürr P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar), to identify cDNAs for E7-binding proteins from a human cDNA expression library (31.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Yeast strain EGY48/pSH1834 (Mat α, his3, ura3, trp1, leu2::lexAo6-pLEU2/lexAo8-Gal1-lacZ::URA3) (28.Zwerschke W. Mazurek S. Massimi P. Banks L. Eigenbrodt E. Jansen-Dürr P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) was used for both the LEU2 and β-galactosidase reporter gene assays. For determination of reporter gene activity, EGY48/pSH1834 was transformed with plasmids expressing various LexA fusion proteins, together with the plasmid pB42- acid-α-Gluc::TRP1, and selected for leucine prototrophy as described (32.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar); alternatively, β-galactosidase activity was determined in cellular extracts as described (32.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). The expression vector for LexA-16E7Δ79-83 was constructed as follows. A polylinker (oligonucleotide I, 5′AATTCCCCGGGGTCGACGGATCCC3′; oligonucleotide II, 5′CATGGGGATCCGTCGACCCCGGGG3′) was inserted into theEcoRI and NcoI sites of pEG202 (31.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), generating the plasmid pEG202-BamHI linker. The 16E7Δ79-83 cDNA was isolated from pJ4ΩΔ79-83 (27.Massimi P. Pim D. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2607-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as BamHI,EcoRI (repair) fragment and inserted into the plasmid pEG202-BamHI linker treated with BamHI andNcoI (repair). Construction of the other LexA fusion protein expression vectors was described (30.Zwerschke W. Joswig S. Jansen-Dürr P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar). All LexA fusion proteins were expressed to the same level, as confirmed by direct immunoblotting, using a polyclonal antibody to LexA (30.Zwerschke W. Joswig S. Jansen-Dürr P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins containing various mutants of E7 were loaded (20 ng/μl each) on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Yeast lysates (1 mg) or purified mature and premature acid α-glucosidase proteins (200 pg/μl) were incubated with GST-E7 fusion proteins, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting (28.Zwerschke W. Mazurek S. Massimi P. Banks L. Eigenbrodt E. Jansen-Dürr P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), using anti-acid α-glucosidase antibodies (33.Oude E.R. Strijland A. Surya I. Brouwer K.E. Kroos M. Hilkens J. Hilgers J. Reuser A.J. Tager J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Input of the various GST-derived fusion proteins was controlled by Coomassie staining. Levels of acid α-glucosidase proteins bound to GST-E7 were quantitated by densitometric scanning of the autoradiogram. The cell line 14/Δ79-83 was generated from primary baby rat kidney cells by stable expression of an activatedras oncogene, combined with glucocorticoid-inducible expression of the HPV-16 E7 mutant Δ79-83 (27.Massimi P. Pim D. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2607-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), as described before for 14/2 cells (34.Crook T. Morgenstern J.P. Crawford L. Banks L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Colonies were selected from the transfection and analyzed for E7 gene expression by Western blot. Normal rat kidney cells were obtained from ATCC (NRK-49F; Batch F-13632). Cells were cultured in DMEM + 10% FCS and dexamethasone, as described previously (28.Zwerschke W. Mazurek S. Massimi P. Banks L. Eigenbrodt E. Jansen-Dürr P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). U2-OS cells, a human osteosarcoma cell line (35.Zerfaß-Thome K. Schulze A. Zwerschke W. Vogt B. Helin K. Bartek J. Henglein B. Jansen-Dürr P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), were cultured in DMEM + 10% FCS. For subcellular fractionation, a method according to Schulze et al. (36.Schulze A. Mannhardt B. Zerfass-Thome K. Zwerschke W. Jansen-Durr P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed for 5 min at 0 °C in two packed cell volumes of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm NaF, 0, 1 mm NaVO3). After addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.05% (v/v) and incubation for 5 min at 0 °C, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 ×g, washed twice in hypotonic lysis buffer, and extracted in high salt extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmNaF, 0.1 mm NaVO3). Protein extracts from the cytoplasmic (1000 × g supernatant) and nuclear fraction were subjected to immunoblotting using antibodies against lamin B (antibody-1, Calbiochem), M2-PK (DF4, ScheBoTech, Wettenberg, Germany), calreticulin (a gift from H. D. Söling), and HPV16 E7 (a gift from J. Braspenning). U2-OS cells were cultured in DMEM + 10% FCS. For transient expression of cDNAs, cells were grown to about 80% confluence on glass coverslips coated with 0.05% gelatin. Transfection of the expression vectors pSHAG2 (37.Hoefsloot L.H. Hoogeveen W.M. Kroos M.A., van, B.J. Reuser A.J. Oostra B.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and pJ4ΩHPV16E7 (27.Massimi P. Pim D. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2607-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was performed using the Effectene method (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 38 h post-transfection, cells were prepared for indirect immunofluorescence according to standard protocols, including methanol fixation. After incubation with primary antibodies (polyclonal rabbit anti-acid α-glucosidase antibodies (33.Oude E.R. Strijland A. Surya I. Brouwer K.E. Kroos M. Hilkens J. Hilgers J. Reuser A.J. Tager J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and monoclonal mouse anti-HPV-16 E7 antibody TVG701 (38.Zatsepina O. Braspenning J. Robberson D. Hajibagheri N. Blight K. Ely S. Hibma M. Spitkovsky D. Trendelenburg M. Crawford L. Tommasino M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), respectively), and secondary antibodies (TRITC-conjugated anti-Mouse IgG and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG from Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), cells were washed and embedded in Fluoromount G (Biozol, Eching, Germany). Samples were viewed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using the confocal scanning system MicroRadiance (Bio-Rad) in combination with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. The following filters were used for FITC-derived and TRITC-derived fluorescence: excitation for both at 488 nm, emission for FITC at 515–530 nm, and for TRITC at >600 nm). As a source of α-glucosidase, extracts of 14/2 cells or purified enzyme were used. 14/2 cells were lysed in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-PO4, pH 7.8, 4 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100 either after dexamethasone withdrawal (non-induced 14/2 cells, E7 not expressed) or 4 h after re-addition of dexamethasone (induced 14/2 cells, E7 expressed). For assays with purified enzyme, the 110-kDa precursor form and the 70/76-kDa mature forms of α-glucosidase were isolated from the milk of transgenic rabbits or human placenta, respectively, as described previously (39.Bijvoet A. Kroos M.A. Pieper F.R. Van der Vliet M. De Boer H. Van der Ploeg A. Verbeet M.P. Reuser A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40.Fuller M. Van der Ploeg A. Reuser A.J. Anson D.S. Hopwood J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were brought to a final protein concentration of 1 μg/μl with 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.2, and purified glucosidase preparations were brought to a final protein concentration of 2.5 ng/μl. Lysates of non-induced 14/2 cells and purified enzymes were preincubated with recombinant GST, GST-E7 wild type, or GST-E7 mutants (20 ng/μl) for 20 min on ice to study the direct influence of E7 on glucosidase activity. Following preincubation, the artificial substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-glucoside (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mm. All samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 m sodium carbonate, pH 10.5, and the extinction of the samples was measured in a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 350 nm. 14/2 cells cultured in the presence or absence of dexamethasone as stated above were pelleted and weighed. Pellets were lysed in 30% NaOH. Glycogen was precipitated with ethanol, washed intensely, and pelleted by centrifugation. Glycogen pellets were dissolved in water and incubated with anthrone reagent (72% H2SO4, 0.5 mg/ml anthrone, and 10 mg/ml thiourea (Sigma)) for 15 min at 100 °C. Extinction of the samples was measured at 578 nm. To identify additional targets for E7, a human cDNA library (31.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) was screened in a yeast two-hybrid experiment, using the C-terminal domain of HPV-16 E7 as bait (Fig.1 A). In this screen, the cDNA encoding acid α-glucosidase (αGluc, Fig.1 B) was repeatedly isolated. Specific interaction of acid α-glucosidase with wild type E7 but not with two unrelated fusion proteins, LexA-Bicoid and LexA-C-Myc, was confirmed by coexpression in yeast, followed by a selection for leucine prototrophy (Fig.1 C). A lacZ reporter gene system was then applied to map the E7 domains required for the interaction with acid α-glucosidase, using LexA fusion proteins containing isolated subdomains of E7 or specific E7 mutants (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.2 B, this experiment revealed that full-length E7 as well as the isolated E7 C terminus strongly interact with acid α-glucosidase, whereas the isolated cd1-(1–17) and cd2-(18–38) subdomains of E7 are inactive in this assay. Similarly, two mutations in the C terminus of E7, GLY58/91 (19.Jewers R. Hildebrandt P. Ludlow J. Kell B. McCance D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Δ79-83 (27.Massimi P. Pim D. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2607-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), strongly reduced the ability of E7 to bind acid α-glucosidase, confirming the conclusion that sequences in the E7 C terminus mediate the binding of acid α-glucosidase. Similar quantities of all fusion proteins were produced in the yeast strains analyzed in Figs. 1 C and 2 B, and these proteins were stable (Fig. 2 C; see also Ref. 30.Zwerschke W. Joswig S. Jansen-Dürr P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar), confirming that the inability of LexA-E7cd1, LexA-E7cd2, and LexA-E7Δ79-83 to promote reporter gene activity is due to the inability of these proteins to interact with acid α-glucosidase.Figure 2Mapping of the acid α-glucosidase-binding site in E7. A,structure of the HPV-16 E7 protein. Conserved domains 1 and 2 (cd1 and cd2) and the putative zinc finger motifs (CXXC) are indicated. E7 mutants used in this report are shown. B, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48/pSH1834, containing a LexA operator-lacZ gene (LexAo8-GAL1-LacZ::URA3), was transformed with the plasmid pB42-acid-α-Gluc::TRP1. Plasmids encoding various LexA fusion proteins were coexpressed, as indicated, and β-galactosidase activity was determined. C,LexA fusion proteins from yeast strains used in B were quantitated by Western blotting, using a polyclonal antiserum to LexA (30.Zwerschke W. Joswig S. Jansen-Dürr P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar). D, purified GST or GST-E7 fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with whole-cell extract from yeast cells, and the amount of B42-HA1-acid-α-Gluc protein that was retained on the beads was determined by direct immunoblotting as described (28.Zwerschke W. Mazurek S. Massimi P. Banks L. Eigenbrodt E. Jansen-Dürr P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), using a polyclonal antiserum to acid α-glucosidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The yeast fusion proteins were then used to demonstrate the binding of acid α-glucosidase to HPV-16 E7 in vitro. When lysates of yeast cells were incubated with GST HPV-16 E7 fusion proteins, the protein containing acid α-glucosidase fused to the B42 trans-activation domain was specifically retained by GST-E7 but not GST protein alone (Fig. 2 D), whereas the isolated B42 domain did not bind to either GST or GST-E7 (data not shown; see Ref. 28.Zwerschke W. Mazurek S. Massimi P. Banks L. Eigenbrodt E. Jansen-Dürr P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, E7 specifically interacts with the acid α-glucosidase part of the fusion protein. To determine if E7 can bind to acid α-glucosidase from mammalian cells, purified GST-E7 fusion proteins were incubated with the 110-kDa (precursor) form of acid α-glucosidase, which had been purified to homogeneity from the milk of acid α-glucosidase transgenic mice (39.Bijvoet A. Kroos M.A. Pieper F.R. Van der Vliet M. De Boer H. Van der Ploeg A. Verbeet M.P. Reuser A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig.3 A, purified acid α-glucosidase interacts with high affinity with GST-16E7 protein but not the GST control. This finding indicates that the 110-kDa form of acid α-glucosidase binds directly to the C terminus of E7, and no additional cellular proteins are required. As in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2), deletion of amino acids 79-83 in the C terminus of E7 considerably reduced the interaction of E7 with acid α-glucosidase (to 68 ± 5% of the value obtained with wild type E7, see also Fig. 3 B), consistent with the C-terminal domain of E7 being involved in the interaction. Replacement of cysteine at position 24 in E7 by glycine nearly abolished the interaction of E7 with acid α-glucosidase (reduction to 14 ± 3% of the value obtained with wild type E7), indicating that sequences in the N terminus of E7 are also essential for a high affinity interaction (Fig. 3 A). Together, these results suggest that several domains of the E7 protein are involved in the interaction with acid α-glucosidase. We also analyzed binding of E7 to the mature lysosomal form of acid α-glucosidase, which had been purified to homogeneity from human placenta (41.Van der Ploeg A. Kroos M.A. Willemsen R. Brons N.H. Reuser A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of the purified 70/76-kDa form of acid α-glucosidase with GST-E7, similar amounts of the enzyme were bound to GST beads and to beads containing GST-E7, indicating that this form of the enzyme does not specifically interact with E7 (Fig.3 C). The 110-kDa form of acid α-glucosidase is found in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex (37.Hoefsloot L.H. Hoogeveen W.M. Kroos M.A., van, B.J. Reuser A.J. Oostra B.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 42.Wisselaar H.A. Kroos M.A. Hermans M.M. van Beeumen J. Reuser A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2223-2231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a fraction of E7 is localized to the nucleus (43.Fujikawa K. Furuse M. Uwabe K.I. Maki H. Yoshie O. Virology. 1994; 204: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), cytoplasmic localization of E7 was also reported (21.Smotkin D. Wettstein F.O. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1686-1689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Kanda T. Zanma S. Watanabe S. Furuno A. Yoshiike K. Virology. 1991; 182: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 44.Sato H. Watanabe S. Furuno A. Yoshiike K. Virology. 1989; 170: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that E7 and acid α-glucosidase may interact in the cytoplasm. To address this point, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of E7-expressing cervical carcinoma (CaSki) cells were prepared. As expected, the nuclear protein lamin B was retrieved in the nuclear fraction, whereas both the cytosolic enzyme M2 pyruvate kinase and the ER-specific protein calreticulin were found exclusively in the cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting that a clean separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins had been achieved (Fig.4). In these experiments, a significant proportion of the E7 protein is retained in the cytoplasm, in keeping with the published literature (21.Smotkin D. Wettstein F.O. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1686-1689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study further the subcellular localization of both proteins and to determine whether E7 and acid α-glucosidase can interact in living cells, the subcellular localization of both proteins was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. U2-OS cells, a human osteosarcoma cell line with high intrinsic transfection efficiency (35.Zerfaß-Thome K. Schulze A. Zwerschke W. Vogt B. Helin K. Bartek J. Henglein B. Jansen-Dürr P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), were transfected with expression vectors for E7 and acid α-glucosidase. It was shown before that up to 48 h after transfection, ectopically expressed acid α-glucosidase is present predominantly in the 110-kDa precursor form, which localizes to the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex, similar to the localization of the endogenous 110-kDa protein (42.Wisselaar H.A. Kroos M.A. Hermans M.M. van Beeumen J. Reuser A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2223-2231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When U2-OS cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector for acid α-glucosidase, transfected cells could be easily identified by their bright staining, using an antibody to acid α-glucosidase. As was described by Wisselaar et al. (42.Wisselaar H.A. Kroos M.A. Hermans M.M. van Beeumen J. Reuser A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2223-2231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ectopic expression of acid α-glucosidase leads to the accumulation of the protein in the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex (Fig.5 A), suggesting that the signal derives from the 110-kDa form. Expression of E7 resulted in a similar cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that both proteins may be localized in similar compartments. Comparison to the >90% untransfected cells within the same coverslip establishes the specificity of both the E7 and acid α-glucosidase immunofluorescence signals. To analyze further colocalization of E7 and acid α-glucosidase, both proteins were coexpressed by transient transfection.

We have identified a protein binding site in the promoter of the β-lactam biosynthesis genepcbC, located 418 nucleotides upstream of the translational start. Using the yeast one-hybrid system, we succeeded in isolating a cDNA clone encoding a polypeptide, which binds specifically to thepcbC promoter. The polypeptid shows significant sequence homology to human transcription factors of the regulatory factor X (RFX) family and was designated CPCR1. A high degree of CPCR1 binding specificity was observed in in vivo and in vitro experiments using mutated versions of the DNA binding site. The A. chrysogenum RFX protein CPCR1 recognizes an imperfect palindrome, which resembles binding sites of human RFX transcription factors. One- and two-hybrid experiments with truncated versions of CPCR1 showed that the protein forms a DNA binding homodimer. Nondenaturing electrophoresis revealed that the CPCR1 protein exists in vitro solely in a multimeric, probably dimeric, state. Finally, we isolated a homologue of thecpcR1 gene from the penicillin-producing fungusPenicillium chrysogenum and determined about 60% identical amino acid residues in the DNA binding domain of both fungal RFX proteins, which show an overall amino acid sequence identity of 29%.

The biosynthesis of cephalosporin C consists of six enzymatics steps, which are catalyzed by five different enzymes. Included among these steps are the condensation of l-α-aminoadipic acid,l-cysteine, and l-valine into a single tripeptide, formation of the bicyclic isopenicillin N, a ring expansion step, and the addition of an acetyl moiety (1.Brakhage A.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 547-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Martin J.F. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 50: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The first two steps of the β-lactam biosynthesis are common to all β-lactam-producing organisms including cephamycin-synthesizing Gram-positive bacteria and the penicillin-producing fungi Penicillium chrysogenum andAspergillus nidulans. These steps are catalyzed by δ-(l-α-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine synthetase and isopenicillin-N synthetase, enzymes that are structurally and functionally similar in all fungal β-lactam producers. The pcbAB and pcbC genes, encoding the δ-(l-α-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine and isopenicillin-N synthetase, respectively, are divergently orientated to each other and share a common intergenic promoter region of about 1 kilobase. The production of cephalosporin and penicillin is influenced by a variety of parameters. These include carbon and nitrogen source, as well as ambient pH (1.Brakhage A.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 547-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular analysis of penicillin production in A. nidulans and P. chrysogenum has revealed some of the genes involved in regulating penicillin biosynthesis. The most complete in vitro and in vivo evidence for the transcriptional regulation of penicillin biosynthesis genes comes from studies with the pH regulatory transcription factor PACC. Reduced transcription activation in reporter genes located downstream of theA. nidulans pcbC promoter was achieved by mutating the PACC binding sites found in this promoter. Similarly, in vitrostudies using the same promoter have identified six possible PACC binding sites in P. chrysogenum (3.Suárez T. Peñalva M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 4.Espeso E.A. Peñalva M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28825-28830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The NRE protein provides another example of a transcription factor regulating the expression of penicillin biosynthesis genes. This protein, which most probably mediates nitrogen repression and derepression, is able to bind to the intergenic pcbAB/pcbC promoter region ofP. chrysogenum (5.Haas H. Marzluf G.A. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast to A. nidulans and P. chrysogenum, no putative regulatory factors of β-lactam biosynthesis have been isolated from A. chrysogenum. However, the divergent promoter region between the pcbAB/pcbC genes inA. chrysogenum contains putative binding sites for PACC and NRE homologues, suggesting the existence of similar regulatory circuits in this fungus. In addition there are three CCAAT-boxes dispersed in the 1.2-kilobase promoter region (6.Menne S. Walz M. Kück U. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 42: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our investigations have already shown that in vitro protein binding abilities are associated with some of the putative motifs. 1R. Radzio, E. Schmitt, and U. Kück, unpublished observations.1R. Radzio, E. Schmitt, and U. Kück, unpublished observations. In this investigation we provide evidence that a palindromic promoter sequence is specifically bound by a novel DNA-binding protein, which shows significant homology to human transcription factors of the RFX2 family. As far as we are aware, this is the first description of a putative transcription factor that recognizes promoter sequences of cephalosporin C biosynthesis genes in A. chrysogenum. Cloning experiments were performed with Escherichia coli strain K12 XL1-Blue MRF′ (Stratagene), and phage transfection experiments were performed with E. coli strain K12 K803 (7.Federoff N. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 1: 27-29Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For our investigation we used A. chrysogenum strains ATCC 14553, A3/2, and Ac1, which is a derivative of strain A3/2 (8.Radzio R. Kück U. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1997; 48: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A library with genomic DNA of strain Ac1 in λ-phage EMBL4 3M. Walz and U. Kück, unpublished results. was screened for a DNA fragment containing the cpcR1 gene by plaque hybridization with the cpcR1 cDNA as a probe. Growth conditions forA. chrysogenum were as described previously (9.Minuth W. Tudzynski P. Esser K. Curr. Genet. 1982; 25: 34-40Google Scholar). The PcRFX1 gene from P. chrysogenum was isolated from a cosmid genomic library of P. chrysogenum that was custom-prepared by Stratagene. 4E. Friedlin and H. Kürnsteiner, personal communication. Using genomic DNA from P. chrysogenum as a template, PCR was performed with primers 1115 (5′-GCTAGTTTCGGGAAGTTGGT) and 1117 (5′-CAATAGTGATACTTTGACTCGCC) corresponding to positions 1374–1393 and 1462–1440 of the A. chrysogenum cpcR1 gene, respectively, and resulted in a 89-bp amplification product. The DNA sequence of the 89-bp fragment was chosen to design two primers for inverse PCR. Using primers 1126 (5′-CTGTACGTTTGGGAAGATG) and 1127 (5′-CTCGGCGTCTTGGAGTCCG), inverse PCR was performed after hydrolysis of genomic DNA with TaqI and ligation. Cloned product of the inverse PCR (490 bp) was used as a probe to screen a genomic cosmid library from P. chrysogenum. Parts of the isolated cosmid clone Pc11 were subcloned and sequenced. The determined sequence (3916 bp) contains an open reading frame for 855 amino acids, encoding the PcRFX1 gene from P. chrysogenum. Total RNA was prepared by phenol extraction (10.Hoge J.H.C. Springer J. Zantinge B. Wessels J.G.H. Exp. Mycol. 1982; 6: 225-232Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) from liquid cultures of A. chrysogenum strain Ac1. Cultivation was undertaken over a period of 2.5 days, and poly(A)(+) RNA was isolated using the Poly(A)Ttract mRNA isolation system (Promega). cDNA was synthesized from 8 μg of poly(A)(+) RNA with an oligo(dT) primer containing a BamHI recognition sequence and incorporating 5-methyl-dCTP (11.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). After blunt-end treatment of cDNA,EcoRI adapters were ligated (11.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar), and the product was digested with BamHI. After size selection using a SizeSepTM400 spun column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the cDNA was ligated with 500 ng of pGAD424 (CLONTECH) digested withEcoRI/BamHI. E. coli transformants were obtained by electroporation using competent XL1-Blue MRF′ cells (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA was prepared from 4 × 105transformants. Complementary oligonucleotides with three copies of the BSII sequence (5′-GTTGCCGGGCCAATCCCTGAGCTT), corresponding to positions 794–817 of the pcbAB/pcbC promoter (6.Menne S. Walz M. Kück U. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 42: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), were cloned into plasmids pHISi and pLacZi, which had been digested withEcoRI and SmaI. The resulting plasmids were designated pHISi-BSII and pLacZi-BSII. A reporter strain HISLACZ-BSII for the transformation of the cDNA library was constructed by integration of both plasmids into yeast strain YM4271. Plasmids and yeast strain YM4271 were provided by the Matchmaker One-Hybrid system kit (CLONTECH). In addition, plasmids and strains with mutated binding sites were obtained by the same procedure. Oligonucleotides were as follows: BSIIm1 (5′-GTTGCCGGGGGTTACCCTGAGCTT), BSIIm2 (5′-GTTGCCGGGCTGATCCCTGAGCTT), and BSIIm3 (5′-CAACCCGGGCCAATCCCTGAGCTT) with substituted nucleotides in bold face. Plasmid pGC1 contains the cpcR1 cDNA and was modified to obtain truncated versions of the activation domain (AD)-CPCR1 fusion protein when expressed in yeast. Deletion of nucleotides 1979–3137 of the cpcR1 gene resulted in plasmid pGC1ΔDIM1. Plasmid pGC1ΔDIM2 has a frameshift at position 2541 of the cpcR1 gene due to the insertion of adapter oligonucleotides at an ApaI site. Deletion of the GAL4 activation domain produced plasmid pC1, a plasmid containing thecpcR1 cDNA downstream of the ADH1 promoter. To obtain two-hybrid plasmids pBDC1, pBDDIM1, and pBDDIM2,EcoRI/SmaI fragments from the plasmids pGC1, pGC1ΔDIM1, and pGC1ΔDIM2 were excised and integrated intoEcoRI/SmaI-digested pGBDU-C(1) (12.James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast reporter strain HISLACZ-BSII was transformed by electroporation using 13.6 μg of library plasmids in 0.1-μg aliquots (11.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). The resulting 5.2 × 106 yeast transformants were plated on his−/leu−-selective media containing 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) at a 55 mm concentration. Transformants were tested for β-galactosidase activity by a filter lift assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Matchmaker One-Hybrid system kit, CLONTECH). Plasmids from putative positive clones were isolated after homogenization with glass beads and then introduced into XL1-Blue MRF′ cells for amplification (11.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Plasmids were then transformed into yeast strain HISLACZ-BSII, and transformants were tested for growth in the presence of 55 mm 3-AT. This step was followed by transformation of plasmids conferring histidine prototrophy into a yeast reporter strain carrying the mutated BSIIm1 site upstream of the HIS3 reporter gene. If the mutation abolished protein binding in the yeast cell, transformants were unable to grow on selective media. This procedure was used to obtain transformants that carry cDNAs for DNA-binding proteins able to interact specifically with BSII sequence. To determine DNA-protein interactions of CPCR1 with different binding sites (BSII, BSIIm1, BSIIm2, BSIIm3) and protein-protein interactions between CPCR1 derivatives, one- and two-hybrid reporter gene assays were performed. For the one-hybrid experiments, yeast strain YM4271, carrying integrated reporter plasmids, was transformed with derivatives of plasmid pGAD424 containing cDNA inserts and tested for growth on his−/leu−-selective media (55 mm 3-AT). To measure the β-galactosidase activity in the transformants, yeast cells were homogenized with glass beads, and cell extract was analyzed for the turn-over ofO-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (13.Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). For two-hybrid experiments, the yeast strain PJ69–4A (12.James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a host for transformation with derivatives of the two plasmids pGBDU-C(1) (12.James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pGAD424 (CLONTECH). Transformants were selected on ura−/leu− media and analyzed for HIS3 reporter activity by streaking on ura−/leu−/his−-selective media containing 6 mm 3-AT. Yeast transformants were grown in liquid selective media and harvested at A 600 1.0.A. chrysogenum Ac1 was cultivated for 2.5 days in liquid CCM media at 27 °C (9.Minuth W. Tudzynski P. Esser K. Curr. Genet. 1982; 25: 34-40Google Scholar). Mycelium/cells were ground in liquid nitrogen, and the following steps were subsequently performed on ice. Resuspension in 8 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9) was followed by the addition of 1/10 volume saturated ammonium sulfate solution. After a 30-min incubation, cell debris was separated by ultracentrifugation (40 000 rpm, 30 min). Proteins were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation) and sedimented by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol) and de-salted by gel filtration (PD10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cultivation and homogenization ofA. chrysogenum and yeast cells were undertaken as described above. Resuspension in 50 ml of buffer A with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was followed by two centrifugation steps (SS34, 15,000 rpm, 20 min and Ti50, 40,000 rpm, 90 min) and filtration. The FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a 1-ml HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was equilibrated with 15 ml of buffer A and loaded with the sample. The flow rate was 1 ml/min for all steps. The elution with a gradient of 0 to 1 m KCl was performed with a plateau at 0.3 m KCl. DNA binding activity was detected in a fraction of 0.5 to 0.6 m KCl. Annealed oligonucleotides BSII were used as probes. The labeling was achieved by filling in one 3′ end with [α-32P]dATP using Klenow polymerase. The labeled DNA was purified by gel filtration. The binding reaction consisted of 3 ng of DNA, 3–6 μg of protein, 0.8 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 1 μl of binding buffer (1 m NaCl, 200 mm Tris, 50 mm MgCl2, 50% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) in a volume of 20 μl. For the competition experiments, nonlabeled oligonucleotides were added to a 10- to 100-fold excess. After a 20-min incubation at 24 °C, the samples were electrophoresed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C with Tris/glycine buffer (0.027m Tris, 0.19 m glycine, pH 8.5). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described above. Thirty to 70 μg of cell extracts from yeast transformants were incubated with the radiolabeled DNA. After electrophoresis, the DNA-protein complexes were transferred on stacked nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) and PVDF (Millipore) membranes by the semidry-blotting method (14.Demczuk S. Harbers M. Vennstroem B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2574-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The DNA, bound to the PVDF membrane, was visualized by autoradiography, whereas the proteins were detected on the nitrocellulose membrane by immunoblot using a chemiluminescence kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The primary antibody anti-GAL4TA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was applied in a concentration of 0.4 μg/μl. To obtain a probe, the 0.28-kilobase BglI DNA fragment (positions 724–1008) from the pcbAB/pcbC promoter was excised from the plasmid pIPNSB1 (6.Menne S. Walz M. Kück U. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1994; 42: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and subcloned in pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid pPCBC5 was cleaved with either HindIII (for the top strand) or EcoRI (for the bottom strand) and labeled with [α-32P]deoxynucleoside triphosphates using Klenow polymerase. To obtain one-end-labeled fragments, plasmid DNA was then digested with either XhoI (top strand) orHindIII (bottom strand). DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis in a 3.75% polyacrylamide gel. DNA fragments were then eluted by incubating gel slices for 1.5 h at 37 °C in an elution buffer (0.2 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA). The eluted DNA fragments were purified by reversed-phase column chromatography using Elutip-d (Schleicher & Schuell). DNase I footprinting reactions were performed with a Core footprinting System (Promega). End-labeled DNA (10–50 ng) was mixed with either 26 μg of cell extract or 9 μg of FPLC-purified protein, 2.5 μl of binding buffer (see above) in a volume of 50 μl and incubated for 20 min on ice. Reactions were then treated with 0.05–0.4 units of DNase I for 1 min at 24 °C. The cleavage products were separated in a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel at 50 °C. Cell extracts from yeast transformants and molecular weight standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were separated in five gels with different acrylamide concentrations (5, 6.25, 7.5, 8.75, 10%) using a BIORAD Protean II xi cell. The recombinant AD-CPCR1 protein was detected by Western blotting, and the results were used to construct a molecular weight standard curve (11.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Usually 120 to 150 μg of protein were loaded. The immunoblot on nitrocellulose membrane and the application of the primary and secondary antibodies were performed as described above. To identify DNA-binding proteins from A. chrysogenum, we performed in vitro studies with putative protein binding motifs derived from the divergent pcbAB/pcbCpromoter region. A set of oligonucleotides was incubated with A. chrysogenum FPLC-purified protein in EMSA reactions to identify promoter sequences showing protein binding properties. Among others, the 24-bp oligonucleotide BSII (details of which are given under “Materials and Methods”) was selected as a putative binding motif. The BSII sequence, −441 to −418 relative to the translation start site of the pcbC gene, contains a CCAAT-box and an imperfect palindrome. EMSA competition experiments with BSII and mutated binding sites revealed a weak but specific DNA-protein interaction (data not shown). In these assays, probes were used that consisted of complementary annealed oligonucleotides with either three copies of the 24-bp BSII motif or three copies of a mutated version of the BSII motif. Our data from the binding studies led to the decision to use the BSII sequence in a one-hybrid screen to isolate transcription factor cDNAs. We used the yeast one-hybrid system for the isolation of a transcription factor interacting with the binding site BSII. This site was cloned into reporter gene plasmids pHISi and pLacZi, and the corresponding recombinant plasmids were integrated into the genome of yeast strain YM4271, generating reporter strain HISLACZ-BSII. This strain served as a host for the transformation of the A. chrysogenum cDNA library. The cDNA library was constructed in plasmid pGAD424 by directional cloning to facilitate the expression of hybrid proteins (with the GAL4 activation domain) in yeast. More than 5 × 106 yeast transformants were plated on media lacking histidine. During a period of 5 to 21 days after DNA-mediated transformation, 2000 putative positives were isolated, re-grown, and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. This selection resulted in 10 positive yeast transformants, which were analyzed further. To verify the dependence of reporter gene activation on plasmid DNAs, plasmids were isolated and re-transformed into strain HISLACZ-BSII. Only two plasmids resulted in histidine prototrophic yeast transformants. To further confirm the specificity of the observed DNA-protein interaction, a strain with a mutated BSIIm1 sequence located upstream of the HIS3 gene was tested. The mutation in BSIIm1 was introduced by substituting a CCAAT for a GGTTA, thereby destroying the putative CCAAT-box. The two plasmids failed to rescue the HIS+phenotype of cells in the reporter strain HIS-BSIIm1, thus providing evidence for binding specificity. Our results indicate that the isolated cDNAs encode DNA-binding proteins with specificity for the BSII sequence from the pcbC promoter. Restriction and hybridization analyses revealed that the two plasmids described above contained similar cDNA inserts with identical restriction sites for different enzymes. The data indicate that the two selected cDNAs encode identical polypeptides fromA. chrysogenum with binding specificity for BSII. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA insert in the corresponding plasmid (pGC1) revealed an open reading frame for 788 amino acids. As expected, the insert was in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain. Analysis of genomic DNA extended the open reading frame to 830 amino acids and revealed the positions of two short introns encompassing 52 and 53 nucleotides (see Fig. 1). The gene was named cpcR1 (for cephalosporin C regulator 1). Southern analysis of genomic DNA isolated from the wild type A. chrysogenum strain ATCC 14553 as well as producer strain A3/2 with a cpcR1 gene probe detected only one single hybridization band (data not shown). The predicted CPCR1 protein sequence shows significant amino acid sequence homology with several polypeptides present in Genbank™ data bases. All these polypeptides belong to the family of RFX transcription factors, which are characterized by a typical DNA binding and dimerization domain (15.Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Among all the RFX transcription factors identified from different organisms, these two domains show the highest degree of sequence homology. Fig. 2 shows an amino acid sequence alignment of the DNA binding domains (75 to 77 amino acids) from selected RFX proteins. More than 50% of the amino acid residues from the DNA binding domains of the CPCR1 protein and the SAK1 protein from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe are identical. In the dimerization domain, a homology of 31.8% was observed between the two proteins, and the overall homology between CPCR1 and SAK1 was still 28%. In comparison, the DNA binding domains from human members of the RFX protein family, RFX1/2/3 and 5, each shared approximately 40% homology with the DNA binding domain of CPCR1. Another novel RFX protein was isolated from P. chrysogenumthrough sequence homology to CPCR1. Using PCR, a small DNA fragment of 89 bp, corresponding to the conserved COOH part of the DNA binding domain, was amplified from P. chrysogenum genomic DNA for DNA sequencing. Using another pair of oligonucleotide primers for inverse PCR, a 490-bp fragment was obtained, that was used to screen a cosmid library of P. chrysogenum genomic DNA. About 3.9 kilobases of a positive cosmid clone were sequenced, identifying an open reading frame for 855 amino acids. The encoded proteins PcRFX1 and CPCR1 from A. chrysogenum show an overall homology of 29%. However, nearly 60% of the amino acid residues from their DNA binding domains are identical, and the two proteins are more closely related to each other than to any other RFX protein. The cpcR1 gene cDNA was isolated through a one-hybrid screen using the BSII binding site. This binding site contains an imperfect palindrome and a CCAAT-box, which overlaps with the right half of the palindrome. We created three mutated binding sites to determine which parts of the BSII sequence play an important or essential role in CPCR1 recognition. All sequences were used to generate yeast reporter strains containing HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes. Reporter strain transformants carrying the plasmid pGC1, which harbors the cpcR1 cDNA, were analyzed for reporter gene activity (Fig. 3). For both BSIIm1 and BSIIm3, no binding of CPCR1 was observed. Both sequences contain substitutions either in the right-hand or in the left-hand part of the palindrome. Yeast cells carrying these mutated binding sites show a dramatic decrease in reporter gene activity. In contrast, the substitution of two nucleotides, which are part of the CCAAT-box, and the right half of the palindrome does not lead to a total loss of CPCR1 binding. The quantification of β-galactosidase activity revealed a reduction to less than one-fourth that of the control. These data suggest that in vivo the CPCR1 protein binds to an imperfect palindromic sequence and that the integrity of both halves is essential for protein binding. To further characterize the binding specificity of the CPCR1 protein, we performed in vitro binding experiments. As mentioned above, a specific interaction of proteins from A. chrysogenum with BSII has already been demonstrated. The availability of yeast transformants with ADH1 promoter-drivencpcR1 gene expression makes in vitro binding assays with an increased amount of specific protein feasible. FPLC-purified protein from yeast transformants was used in EMSA, and the formation of a DNA-protein complex with BSII was observed. In competition analyses with BSII, the formation of the complex could be prevented by a 100-fold molar excess, whereas the same excess of BSIIm3 did not result in the complete reduction of complex formation (Fig.4). This confirms the binding specificity of the CPCR1 protein with the palindromic sequence, as previously indicated by the results from the one-hybrid experiments. To exclude the involvement of yeast proteins, we have tested protein extracts from a control yeast transformant in EMSA. This strain synthesized only the GAL4 AD, and protein extracts from the strain produced DNA-protein complexes clearly different from those above. The binding specificity of the recombinant fusion protein AD-CPCR1 with BSII was further analyzed using shift-Western blotting (14.Demczuk S. Harbers M. Vennstroem B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2574-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this method the proteins are transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, whereas the DNA is blotted on a second membrane (PVDF). Using an antibody against the yeast GAL4 AD, which is part of the recombinant protein AD-CPCR1, we were able to detect protein components of the BSII DNA-protein complex (Fig. 5). The same band also appeared by loading protein without DNA (lane 5, Fig. 5), indicating that the migration of the retarded complex in the gel mainly depends on the size and charge of the protein component. Results obtained from protein extracts of the control yeast transformant synthesizing only the GAL4 AD underline the specificity of the retarded complex (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7). In conclusion, the electrophoretic mobility shift assays with protein extracts from recombinant yeast transformants underscore the binding specificity of the CPCR1 protein in vitro. Both one-hybrid experiments and EMSA were performed with synthetic oligonucleotides containing three copies of the analyzed binding site. In DNase I footprinting experiments, we used a DNA fragment from the pcbC promoter together with protein from either A. chrysogenum strain Ac1 or yeast transformants to detect a DNA-protein interaction close to the BSII sequence. In Fig. 6, data from DNase I footprinting experiments are shown with protection patterns of A. chrysogenum cell crude extract as well as FPLC-purified protein from a yeast transformant producing a recombinant AD-CPCR1 protein. Using the bottom strand, inhibition of DNase I cleavage was observed with both protein extracts in the range of −444 to −409 with respect to the translational start of the pcbC gene. The A. chrysogenum cell extract seems to inhibit DNase I cleavage even beyond position −444, implying the possibility of additional DNA-protein interactions in this promoter region. It was found that protection patterns in the top strand appeared between positions −401 to −435. In this case, a difference in pattern was recognized with the A."
https://openalex.org/W1968232203,"HSP25, a previously uncharacterized member of the α-crystallin family of small heat shock proteins inCaenorhabditis elegans, has been examined using biochemical and immunological techniques. HSP25 is the second largest of 16 identifiable small heat shock proteins in the nematode and is expressed at all developmental stages under normal growth conditions. Recombinant HSP25 produced in Escherichia coli exists predominantly as small oligomers (dimers to tetramers) and possesses chaperone activity against citrate synthase in vitro. InC. elegans, HSP25 is localized to dense bodies and M-lines in body wall muscle, to the lining of the pharynx, and to the junctions between cells of the spermathecal wall. Affinity chromatography of nematode extracts on a column of immobilized HSP25 resulted in specific binding of vinculin and α-actinin but not actin, as revealed by Western blotting. These results suggest a role for HSP25 in the organization or maintenance of the myofilament lattice and adherens junctions in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2048679642,"Cell surface-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans, predominantly perlecan, are involved in the process of binding and endocytosis of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) by vascular endothelial cells. To investigate the structural properties of heparan sulfate (HS) side chains that mediate this interaction, the proteoglycans were isolated from porcine endothelial cells and HS chains obtained thereof by β-elimination. To characterize the structural composition of the HS chains and to identify the TSP-1-binding sequences, HS was disintegrated by specific chemical and enzymatic treatments. Cell layer-derived HS chains revealed the typical structural heterogeneity with domains of non-contiguously arranged highly sulfated disaccharides separated by extended sequences containing predominantly N-acetylated sequences of low sulfation. Affinity chromatography on immobilized TSP-1 demonstrated that nearly all intact HS chains possessed binding affinity, whereas after heparinase III treatment only a small proportion of oligosaccharides were bound with similar affinity to the column. Size fractioning of the bound and unbound oligosaccharides revealed that only a specific portion of deca- to tetradecasaccharides possessed TSP-1-binding affinity. The binding fraction contained over 40% di- and trisulfated disaccharide units and was enriched in the content of the trisulfated 2-O-sulfated l-iduronic acid-N-sulfated-6-O-sulfated glucosamine disaccharide unit. Comparison with the disaccharide composition of the intact HS chains and competition experiments with modified heparin species indicated the specific importance of N- and 6-O-sulfated glucosamine residues for binding. Further depolymerization of the binding oligosaccharides revealed that the glucosamine residues within the TSP-1-binding sequences are not continuously N-sulfated. The present findings implicate specific structural properties for the HS domain involved in TSP-1 binding and indicate that they are distinct from the binding sequence described for basic fibroblast growth factor, another HS ligand and a potential antagonist of TSP-1.

Sage E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 62-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). TSP-1 was initially found in α-granules of platelets where it is involved in aggregation and clot formation (2.Lawler J.W. Slayter H.S. Coligan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8609-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later on, the expression of the 450-kDa trimeric glycoprotein by a variety of cells including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages has been observed (3.McPherson J.

The protein is secreted and incorporated into the extracellular matrix. The modular organization of TSP-1 enables binding to cells, platelets, and macromolecules, such as different types of collagen, fibronectin, fibrinogen, sulfated glycolipids, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (reviewed in Refs. 7.Frazier W.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar and 8.Mosher D.F. Annu. Rev. Med. 1990; 41: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition to the role of TSP-1 during platelet aggregation, the molecule is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation of a variety of cells (9.Majack R.A. Cook S.C. Bornstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9050-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10.Phan S.H. Dillon R.G. McGarry B.M. Dixit V.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Calcium-binding repeats influence the function of the glycoprotein in cell adhesion and the binding to proteases (12.Lawler J. Weinstein R. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar,13.Hogg P.J. Owensby D.A. Chesterman C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21811-21818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured endothelial cells, TSP-1 is a major secretory product. The functional properties of TSP-1 in the context of the vascular endothelium are complex. On some substrates TSP-1 promotes endothelial cell adhesion (14.Taraboletti G. Roberts D. Liotta L.A. Giavazzi R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TSP-1 has been shown to reduce focal adhesion and to serve as an antiadhesive matrix component (15.Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Höök M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,16.Adams J.C. Lawler J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1061-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TSP-1 promotes migration of endothelial cells but inhibits migration induced by basic fibroblast growth factor. TSP-1 and a 140-kDa TSP fragment act as an inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro (17.Rastinejad F. Polverini P.J. Bouk N.P. Cell. 1989; 56: 345-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 18.Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Furthermore, native TSP-1 and its proteolytic fragments with antiangiogenic activity inhibit proliferation of endothelial cells (19.Tolsma S.S. Volbert O.V. Good D.J. Frazier W.A. Polverini P.J. Bouck N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Because angiogenesis is directly linked to tumor growth and metastasis, it is not surprising that TSP-1 has been implicated in malignant processes (reviewed in Ref.20.Roberts D.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Essential for the diverse biological effects of TSP-1 is the binding of the molecule to specific cell surface receptors. In the last years the binding to a number of different cell surface molecules has been reported, including CD36, a 105/80-kDa heterodimeric membrane protein, integrins of the β3 and β1 families, an integrin-associated protein, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, and HS-PG (21.Asch A.S.

The interactions with cell surface structures are mediated through different domains of TSP-1. The N-terminal globular domain possesses binding sequences for heparan sulfate proteoglycans (28.Sun X. Mosher D.F. Rapraeger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2885-2889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a sequence containing SVTCG within type 1 repeats, which interacts with CD36 and a 50-kDa tumor cell receptor (29.Li W.-X.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and a single RGD sequence in the type 3 domain that binds to αvβ3 integrins (12.Lawler J. Weinstein R. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 16.Adams J.C. Lawler J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1061-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two C-terminal sequences of TSP have substantial affinity to CD47, an integrin-associated protein at the cell surface (24.Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In several studies the receptor-like function of heparan sulfate proteoglycans has been demonstrated during the process of binding, uptake, and degradation of TSP-1 by cultured cells (26.Murphy-Ullrich J.E.

Our laboratory recently reported that in porcine endothelial cells, perlecan amounts for at least 90% of membrane-associated HS-PGs and is responsible for the TSP-1-binding activity (33.Vischer P. Feitsma K. Schön P. Völker W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 332-343PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface HS-PGs take part in the membrane binding of various enzymes and growth factors and interact with components of the extracellular matrix (34.Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The HS-binding sequences for some of the various ligands of HS-PGs are well characterized, and this raises the question, also with respect to biological functions of TSP-1, about the nature of the TSP-binding site in heparan sulfate chains. In the present study, we report the isolation and characterization of distinct heparan sulfate oligosaccharides from endothelial cell-associated HS-PGs that exhibit specific affinity for TSP-1. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, trypsin, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Eschwege, Germany). [35S]Sulfate (carrier free; 1400 Ci/mmol) was obtained from ICN, and [3H]glucosamine (35 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Heparinase III (EC 4.2.2.8), heparinase I (EC 4.2.2.7), and chondroitin ABC lyase (EC4.2.2.4) were obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Heparinase II (no EC number assigned), heparin, N-acetylated heparin, and unsaturated heparan sulfate disaccharide standards were purchased from Sigma. Heparin-Sepharose, gelatin-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose FF, and DEAE-Sephacel were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bio-Gel P-6 was obtained from Bio-Rad . All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Thrombospondin was isolated from human platelets according to previously published procedures (3.McPherson J. Sage H. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11330-11336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Dixit V.M. Grant G.A. Santoro S.A. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10100-10105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and gel filtration chromatography on Bio-Gel A 0.5 (Bio-Rad). TSP-1 purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. TSP-1 was coupled to Eurocell ONB-carbonate cellulose beads (Eurochrom, Berlin, Germany) in the presence of N-acetylated heparin (36.Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coupling was performed at 4 °C overnight according to the manufacturer's instructions at a concentration of 1.5 mg TSP/ml Eurocell ONB beads. The remaining unreacted groups on the beads were blocked with 1m ethanolamine. Porcine aortic endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as described previously (37.Vischer P. Buddecke E. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 158: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells from the second and third passage were used. Porcine endothelial cells were metabolically radiolabeled either with [35S]sulfate (50 μCi/ml) or with [3H]glucosamine (10 μCi/ml) or were double-labeled with both isotopes for up to 48 h. The medium was collected and centrifuged at 2000 × g to remove cellular debris. Urea (6 m) and protease inhibitors were added, and the medium was stored at −20 °C. The cell layer was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with 8m urea, containing 2% Triton X-100, 1% CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, 50 mm6-aminohexanoic acid, 5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C for up to 12 h. Unincorporated radioactivity was either removed by chromatography on prepacked PD 10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech),or the cell layer extract containing HS and CS/DS proteoglycans was applied in the first step to ion-exchange chromatography on a column of Q-Sepharose FF (1-ml bed volume, preequilibrated with 6 m urea, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1m NaCl, and 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0). The column was washed with 30 bed volumes of this buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl, and the proteoglycans were eluted with 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6. To obtain free glycosaminoglycan chains by β-elimination, the proteoglycan fraction of the cell layer was desalted on a PD-10 column after Q-Sepharose chromatography and thereafter subjected to β-elimination for 20 h in 0.1m NaOH and 1 m NaBH4 (final concentration) at 37 °C. As shown by control experiments with heparin (Sigma), this procedure did not result in a measurable liberation of inorganic sulfate. After β-elimination the mixture was neutralized with 50% acetic acid, diluted with 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and applied to a 0.5-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel. After a washing step with 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, the free glycosaminoglycan chains were eluted with the same buffer containing 800 mm NaCl. Small amounts of CS/DS were removed from the glycosaminoglycan-containing samples after a desalting step on a PD 10 column by incubation with 0.5 units/ml chondroitin ABC lyase in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 60 mm sodium acetate (pH 8) for 4 h at 37 °C. CS/DS oligosaccharides were removed by reapplication to a small DEAE-Sephacel column by a washing step with 0.3 m NaCl, and recovery of the free HS chains was obtained by elution with 0.8 mNaCl. HS chains were depolymerized with heparinase III or heparinase I at a concentration of 20 milliunits/ml in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 2 mm calcium acetate. Heparinase III and heparinase I digestions were performed either in the presence of bovine kidney heparan sulfate (0.25 mg/ml) or of heparin (0.25 mg/ml) as a carrier. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, and the reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 2 min. Cleavage of intact HS chains and oligosaccharides with affinity to TSP-1 by HNO2 treatment at low pH (1.5) was carried out by the method of Shiveley and Conrad (38.Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Equal volumes of cold 0.5 m H2SO4 and 0.5m Ba(NO2)2 solution were mixed on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min to remove the precipitated barium sulfate. The nitrous acid reagent (50 μl) was added to the lyophilized samples, and after 15 min the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mNa2CO3 (10 μl). To evaluate the occurrence of “anomalous” deamination ring contraction during HNO2treatment, control experiments were performed where the oligosaccharides with TSP-1 affinity were subsequently subjected to mild acid treatment (25 mm H2SO4, 80 °C, 30 min) and analyzed further by gel filtration chromatography (39.Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 40.Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin (1 mg/ml) from porcine intestinal mucosa (Sigma) was selectivelyN-desulfated by acid hydrolysis with 0.04 m HCl for 1 h at 100 °C under nitrogen followed by neutralization and dialysis against water. Complete reacetylation was achieved by treatingN-desulfated heparin, dissolved in 4.5 m sodium acetate containing 20% (v/v) methanol, with five additions of acetic anhydride in 10-min intervals at ambient temperature, each 1/5 of the original volume. Selective 2-O-desulfation was performed by lyophilization of an aqueous solution of heparin, sodium salt (4 mg/ml H2O), brought to pH 12.5 by NaOH addition (41.Jaseja M. Rej R.N. Sauriol F. Perlin A.S. Can. J. Chem. 1989; 67: 1449-1456Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This treatment reduced the percentage of 2-O-sulfate groups-containing disaccharides from 75% in the mucosal heparin to 3%. For 6-O-desulfation the pyridinium salt of heparin (10 mg/ml pyridine) was treated withN-methyltrimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide (200 μl/ml heparin solution) for 2 h at 100 °C (42.Ishihara M. Takano R. Kanda T. Hayashi K. Hara S. Kikuchi H. Yoshida K. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After the addition of an equal volume of 20% methanol, the reaction mixture was dialyzed against water, adjusted to pH 9–10 with NaOH, and dialyzed again. A reduction of the proportion of 6-O-sulfated disaccharides from 85% in heparin to 17% was thereby achieved. For affinity chromatography the intact HS chains or heparinase III-resistant oligosaccharides were dissolved in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 at pH 7.4 (binding buffer) and loaded onto a column of TSP-cellulose beads (1 ml) preequilibrated with this buffer. After washing the column with 10 ml of this buffer, elution of the bound fraction was obtained with a linear gradient of 0.05–1m NaCl (30 ml) in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and the radioactivity of an aliquot of all fractions was determined. For isolation of TSP-1-binding heparinase III-resistant oligosaccharides, binding assays were performed in Eppendorf tubes by incubating [3H]glucosamine-labeled HS oligosaccharides dissolved in binding buffer (1 ml) with 500 μl of immobilized TSP-1. After 2 h of end over end rotation at 4 °C, the suspension was transferred to a Pasteur pipette and washed stepwise with binding buffer and buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Radioactivity found in these steps represent the TSP-1-unbound oligosaccharides. TSP-1-binding oligosaccharides were subsequently obtained by elution with 1-ml fractions of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5m NaCl. The pooled fractions of TSP-1-bound and TSP-1-unbound material were used for gel chromatography and disaccharide analysis. For direct comparison of the disaccharide composition of the TSP-1-bound and -unbound deca- and higher oligosaccharide fraction, the TSP-1-unbound oligosaccharide material was size-fractionated on a Bio-Gel P-6 column (120 × 1 cm), and the octasaccharide and the deca- and higher oligosaccharides were isolated thereof. For inhibition of HS/TSP-1-binding by chemically modified heparin species, heparinase III-sensitive oligosaccharides were prepared from [35S]sulfate-labeled endothelial HS and size-fractionated as described above. Deca- and higher saccharides were lyophilized and dissolved in binding buffer at a concentration of about 12 × 103 cpm/ml. For binding assays 200 μl of immobilized TSP-1 were suspended in 800 μl of binding buffer. After centrifugation, the gel was mixed with radioactive ligand (15 μl) and 385 μl of binding buffer ± 0.2 μg inhibitor. After 2 h of end over end rotation at ambient temperature, the suspension was transferred into Pasteur pipettes and washed with 4 × 500 μl of binding buffer to determine the amount of unbound material. Bound material was eluted by applying 2 × 500 μl of 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 m NaCl. All assays were done in triplicate. Gel filtration chromatography of oligosaccharides after enzymatic or deaminative scission of endothelial HS or HS oligosaccharides with affinity to TSP-1 was performed on a Bio-Gel P-6 column (120 × 1 cm) equilibrated in 0.5 m NH4HCO3. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 4 ml/h, and 1-ml fractions were collected. An aliquot of each fraction was used for determination of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. From the 3H elution profile of the oligosaccharides the extent of glycosidic bond cleavage could be calculated as described by Malmström et al. (43.Malmström A. Carlstedt I. Aberg L. Franson L.-Å. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Disaccharides were analyzed by strong anion exchange chromatography after complete (more than 90%, as judged by gel filtration) depolymerization by exhaustive digestion with a mixture of heparinases I, II, and III as described (44.Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lyases were used at concentrations of 2.5 units/ml (heparinases I and II) and 50 munits/ml (heparinase III). The disaccharides were recovered by chromatography on a Superdex peptide HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated and eluted with 0.5 mNH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The lyophilized digestion products were subjected to strong anion exchange-HPLC on a Phenosphere 5 strong anion exchange 80 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Phenomenex, Hösbach, Germany). After the column had been equilibrated at a flow rate of 0.8 ml with double deionized water and adjusted to pH 3.5 with HCl, samples were injected, and the column was developed with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.75m in the same mobile phase) over 60 min. Disaccharides were monitored either by UV detection at 232 nm or by liquid scintillation counting of 300-μl fractions. Calibration was performed with a set of eight disaccharides kindly provided by Dr. J. T. Gallagher, University of Manchester, UK. In previous studies it was shown that porcine endothelial cells synthesize proteoglycans containing HS and CS/DS glycosaminoglycan chains (33.Vischer P. Feitsma K. Schön P. Völker W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 332-343PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas CS/DS-containing compounds were found predominantly in the culture medium, one major high molecular weight HS-PG was detected, which upon labeling with radiosulfate, amounted for about 90% of all HS-PG species. It was mainly associated with the cell layer but also partly released into the culture medium. Immunoprecipitation identified the proteoglycan as perlecan, and it was localized in the subendothelial matrix but also closely associated with the cell surface (33.Vischer P. Feitsma K. Schön P. Völker W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 332-343PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the involvement of HS chains of the cell layer during binding and endocytosis of TSP-1 (31.Völker W. Schön P. Vischer P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32.Schön P. Vischer P. Völker W. Schmidt A. Faber V. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 329-339PubMed Google Scholar), structural features of cell layer-derived HS required for the TSP/HS interactions were investigated. For characterization of the structural features of the cell layer-derived HS chains, endothelial cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate or [3H]glucosamine, and the proteoglycan fraction was isolated from the cell extract by ion-exchange chromatography. After β-elimination and enzymatic degradation of the small amount (8–10%) of CS/DS present in the cellular extract, a purified HS fraction was obtained. SDS gel electrophoresis revealed that the intact HS-PG was predominantly found in the stacking gel, whereas the purified HS fraction entered the separation gel and migrated like globular proteins of an apparent molecular mass of about 100–180 kDa (data not shown). The cell layer-derived HS chains were characterized by specific cleavage with chemical or enzymatic methods followed by gel filtration. The oligosaccharide fragments obtained either with heparinase I or III or nitrous acid treatment at low pH were separated on Bio-Gel P-6 columns to separate the oligosaccharide fragments. The major structural requirement of heparinase III for acting on α-glycosidic linkages is the presence of glucuronic acid. But the enzyme tolerates both N-sulfated and N-acetylated glucosamine residues at the glycosidic linkage to be split (GlcNR(±6S)α1–4GlcA). Resistant oligosaccharides represent highly sulfated regions of the parent HS chains. Based on the [3H]glucosamine-labeling profile heparinase III cleaved 76% of the linkages in the HS chains (Fig.1 a and TableI). The major cleavage products (65% of total radioactivity) were mono- or unsulfated disaccharides as identified by strong anion exchange-HPLC of the disaccharide fraction (data not shown). Only a small proportion consisted of tetrasaccharides, whereas hexa- and octasaccharides represented the main fraction of oligosaccharides (about 20% of the total3H radioactivity). Heparinase I acts on highly sulfated and epimerized sequences of HS and cleaves α-glycosidic linkages ofN-sulfonylglucosamine if the adjacent uronic acid is iduronic acid 2-sulfate (GlcNS(±6S)α1–4IdoA(2S)). Only a small proportion of the linkages in the HS chains was susceptible to the enzyme (12, 5%). About 3% of di- and tetrasaccharides were produced. The majority (94%) of the oligosaccharide fraction was not separated by gel chromatography on Bio-Gel P-6 and is therefore dp 16 and higher (Fig. 1 b). Treatment of HS chains with nitrous acid at low pH leads to deaminative cleavage of N-sulfonylglucosaminyl residues (GlcNS(±6S)α1–4 hexuronic acid (±2S)). This deaminative scission caused a limited fragmentation of HS chains and yielded different oligosaccharides up to higher than dp 16, with tetrasaccharides as the main fraction (Fig. 1 c). From the breakdown products caused by nitrous acid an N-sulfate content of 35% can be calculated. Only marginal differences in the depolymerization patterns were observed between HS chains obtained from cell-derived or medium-released HS-PG (data not shown). The cleavage profiles produced by the different depolymerization conditions provide evidence that endothelial cell-derived HS possesses a domain structure with sulfate-rich and sulfate-poor clusters as reported for other HS species. Moreover, this result allows us to predict some information on the distribution of the susceptible linkages as summarized in Table I. In the case of heparinase I treatment the low yield of di- and tetrasaccharides refl"

Intracomplex electron transfer was studied using a cytochrome c derivative labeled with ruthenium trisbipyridine at lysine 72 (Ru-72-Cc). Flash photolysis of a 1:1 complex between Ru-72-Cc and cytochromebc 1 at low ionic strength resulted in electron transfer from photoreduced heme c to cytochromec 1 with a rate constant ofk et = 6 × 104s−1. Compared with the wild-type enzyme, the mutants substituted at Glu-74, Glu-101, Asp-102, Glu-104, Asp-109, Glu-162, Glu-163, and Glu-168 have significantly lowerk et values as well as significantly higher equilibrium dissociation constants and steady-stateK m values.

https://openalex.org/W2054920162,"The enzyme variant glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) A−, which gives rise to human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, is a protein of markedly reduced structural stability. This variant differs from the normal enzyme, G6PD B, in two amino acid substitutions. A further nondeficient variant, G6PD A, bears only one of these two mutations and is structurally stable. In this study, the synergistic structural defect in recombinant G6PD A− was reflected by reduced unfolding enthalpy due to loss of β-sheet and α-helix interactions where both mutations are found. This was accompanied by changes in inner spatial distances between residues in the coenzyme domain and the partial disruption of tertiary structure with no significant loss of secondary structure. However, the secondary structure of G6PD A− was qualitatively affected by an increase in β-sheets substituting β-turns related to the lower unfolding enthalpy. The structural changes observed did not affect the active site of the mutant proteins, since its spatial position was unmodified. The final result is a loss of folding determinants leading to a protein with decreased intracellular stability. This is suggested as the cause of the enzyme deficiency in the red blood cell, which is unable to perform de novo protein synthesis."

We have shown that chloroplast phosphoribulokinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC1.2.1.13) in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells exist as a bi-enzyme complex made up of two molecules of dimeric phosphoribulokinase and two molecules of tetrameric glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (24.Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A similar bi-enzyme complex has recently been found to contain a so-called CP12, besides the two enzymes (29.Wedel N. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9699-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Unlike the free stable enzyme, oxidized phosphoribulokinase may have a quite significant activity when associated with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (25.Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On dilution, the complex may dissociate, and the released metastable phosphoribulokinase is also active and slowly relapses into the free stable form (25.Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, the association of phosphoribulokinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gives rise to conformation changes resulting in the appearance of active oxidized phosphoribulokinase. We have therefore studied the activation by thioredoxin of algal phosphoribulokinase within a bi-enzyme complex made up of this enzyme and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The wild type WM3− strain of C. reinhardtii was heterotrophically grown in the dark at 25 °C on Tris acetate/phosphate medium (31.Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Source Book: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. 1st Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 25-31Google Scholar). Ribulose 5-phosphate was obtained from Sigma. ATP, NAD(H), phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The phosphoribulokinase-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase complex was purified from C. reinhardtiicells, essentially as described previously, but in the absence of cysteine (24.Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin from a cyanobacterium, Spirulinasp. (Sigma), was used because our efforts to purify thioredoxin fromChlamydomonas have failed, probably because of the instability of this protein in the alga (32.Huppe H.C. De Lamotte-Guery F. Jacquot J.P. Buchanan B.B. Planta. 1990; 180: 341-351Google Scholar). Free metastable enzyme was obtained after dilution of the bi-enzyme complex (about 500-fold) in the assay cuvette at pH 7.7 and 30 °C in the absence of substrates. Under these conditions, the complex dissociates, and the free metastable form of phosphoribulokinase appears. In most experiments, the phosphoribulokinase activity of the bi-enzyme complex or of the dissociated metastable form was followed, in the presence of both substrates and thioredoxin, using the principle of Tian and Tsou (33.Tian W.X. Tsou C.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Phosphoribulokinase was measured spectrophotometrically using a coupled assay with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase at 30 °C (7.Rault M. Gontero B. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thioredoxins were reduced by incubation with 20 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min. For thioredoxin activation experiments, thioredoxin was always present in a large excess relative to the bi-enzyme complex and kept permanently reduced in the assay cuvette using 0.5 or 1 mmdithiothreitol. Protein concentrations were determined according to Ref. 34.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar. The experimental data were fitted to the equations generated by the model using Simplex (35.Nelder J.A. Mead R. Computer J. 1965; 7: 308-313Crossref Google Scholar) or Marquardt (36.Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) algorithms and a VAX computer. Oxidized phosphoribulokinase can be reduced and activated by reducing agents. Therefore, the activity of the bi-enzyme complex can be followed while undergoing reduction by thioredoxin. Different thioredoxin concentrations were used with a fixed concentration of dithiothreitol, and the activity of the phosphoribulokinase was measured at saturating concentrations of both substrates (1 mm ribulose 5-phosphate and ATP). There was a latency period, whatever the thioredoxin concentration used, and all progress curves were monophasic (Fig. 1). Indeed in the presence of 1 μm reduced thioredoxin, the progress curve was not a straight line or an exponential but could be fit using a combination of these two functions. The lag phase was associated with the slow depolymerization of the complex on dilution in the reaction mixture at 30 °C. Exactly as in the case of oxidized form, a best fit was obtained by assuming that the complex and the dissociated forms were active (25.Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The lag therefore resulted from the conversion of a less active form (phosphoribulokinase in the complex) into a more active one (phosphoribulokinase released from the complex). If the bi-enzyme complex was allowed to dissociate (25.Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in the assay cuvette for 10 min at 30 °C before the substrates and 1 μm reduced thioredoxins were added, no lag was detected (curve 2, Fig. 2), contrary to the curve obtained with the complex (curve 1, Fig. 2). Therefore the metastable phosphoribulokinase released from the complex on dilution did not exhibit a lag phase even upon reduction by thioredoxin. These results indicate that the binding of reduced thioredoxin was fast relative to the dissociation process. The dissociation process was therefore the limiting step and was responsible for the lag. The apparent steady state (quasi-linear part of the curve) after the lag, as observed with the bi-enzyme complex, was related to the dissociated metastable form. When the steady-state rates pertaining to the metastable phosphoribulokinase released from the complex were plotted as a function of reduced thioredoxin, a sigmoid curve was observed (Fig. 3). The simplest model that can accommodate these results is shown in Fig.4.Figure 4Theoretical model of oxidized phosphoribulokinase activation induced by reduced thioredoxin. C and D indicate phosphoribulokinase in the bi-enzyme complex and the released metastable phosphoribulokinase, respectively. The reduced and the oxidized states are labeledr and o whatever the phosphoribulokinase forms (free or in the complex). The constants Ki correspond to apparent binding constants of thioredoxin (T) to the different phosphoribulokinase forms. The constantski correspond to the apparent dissociation constants of the complex forms into the dissociated (metastable (D)) forms. The constants ci and c−i correspond to the binding and desorption constants of the substratesS (both ATP and ribulose 5-phosphate). The constants μi correspond to the catalytic constants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As mentioned above, reduced thioredoxins were rapidly bound to phosphoribulokinase, and the corresponding steps can be considered to be in rapid equilibrium. The rate of conversion of the enzyme-substrate forms into enzyme-product forms was slower and was therefore in a steady state. One can therefore contract the kinetic scheme of Fig. 4to the model of Fig. 5 by using Cha's factors (37.Cha S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 820-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation of the bi-enzyme complex, whether oxidized or reduced, was the slowest process and occurred in one step. The simplified kinetic Model 1 may thus be proposed,X→λ*Y(Model 1)where X and Y correspond to oxidoreduction states of the phosphoribulokinase included in the bi-enzyme complex (C o, C o S,C r, and C r S) and of the recently metastable dissociated phosphoribulokinase (D o, D o S,D r, and D r S), respectively. λ* corresponds to the grouping of apparent dissociation constants of the complex forms into the dissociated metastable phosphoribulokinase forms and is equal to Equation 1,λ*=(k1f1+k3f3)ϕ1′+(k2f2+k4f4)ϕ1Equation 1 where the ϕ parameters represent the normalized steady-state concentrations of the various enzyme forms. The time evolution of the overall process may be described through Equation 2.dY(t)dt=λ*X(t)Equation 2 Owing to the following conservation Equation 3,X(t)=Pt−Y(t)Equation 3 where P t is the total protein concentration, it can be demonstrated that the product q assumes the form shown in Equation 4,q=At+Bλ*(1−e−λ*t)Equation 4 and indeed, all experimental progress curves (Fig. 1) were fitted to this equation. Moreover, λ* is a complex function of the form shown in Equation 5,λ*=a[T] 3+b[T] 2+c[T]+da[T] 4+b[T] 3+c[T] 2+d[T]+eEquation 5 and therefore λ* should decrease as a function of thioredoxin concentration. This is what was obtained experimentally (Fig.6). By using Equation 4, values of the steady-state rates (A) were plotted as a function of thioredoxin concentration, and a sigmoid was obtained (Fig. 3). To test if the theoretical model depicted in Fig. 4 could also account for this experimental result, the equations were written under steady-state conditions, and the rate is as follows:v[E] 0=Equation 6 [T] 2(μ4c4K3K4[S])+[T](c2μ4K4+c4μ2K3)+(μ2c2[S])[T] 2(c4[S]+c−4+μ4)K3K4+[T](((c2K4+c4K3)[S]+(c−4+μ4)K4+(c−2+μ2)K3))+c2[S]+(c−2+μ2)Equation 6 therefore accounts for the sigmoidicity observed. Moreover, if [T]= 0, Equation 6 reduces to Equation 7.v[E] 0=(μ2[S])[S]+(c−2+μ2)c2Equation 7 If [T] is high, Equation 6 then reduces to Equation8.v[E] 0=(μ4[S])[S]+(c−4+μ4)c4Equation 8 Equations 7 and 8 follow the Michaelis-Menten law, and they describe the behavior of the oxidized complex and of the fully reduced dissociated metastable phosphoribulokinase, respectively, as described previously (25.Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28.Lebreton S. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20879-20884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fitting our experimental results to Equation 6 makes it possible to simplify this to give Equation 9,v[E] 0=[T] 2(μ4c4K3K4[S])+(μ2c2[S])[T] 2(c4[S]+c−4+μ4)K3K4+c2[S]+(c−2+μ2)Equation 9 in which the terms in [T], both in the numerator and the denominator are negligible, with (μ4 c 4 K 3 K 4[S]) close to 520, (μ2 c 2[S]) to 10, (c 4[S]c −4 + μ4)K 3 K 4close to 1, and c 2[S] + (c −2 + μ2) to 0.2 (Fig.7, curve 1). By taking into account these values, one can estimate the values of μ2and μ4 to be approximately equal to 520 and 50 s−1, respectively. These values are in good agreement with those previously reported (25.Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28.Lebreton S. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20879-20884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Different parameters were used to simulate Equation 9, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. An increase in the parameterc2 [S] + (c−2 + μ2) associated with the bi-enzyme complex results in a marked sigmoidicity (Fig. 7, curve 3). A decrease in the parameter [S]μ4 c4K3K4 associated with the metastable form of phosphoribulokinase results in a decrease of the maximal steady-state rate, and at [T] = 0, the steady-state rate is null (Fig. 7, curve 2). The steady-state rate is related to the metastable form of phosphoribulokinase and obviously depends on the kinetic parameters of this form. These results also demonstrate that this rate depends on the kinetic parameters of the bi-enzyme complex from which the metastable form originates. From the model in Fig. 4, it can be seen that thioredoxin is able to bind both to phosphoribulokinase within the bi-enzyme complex and to metastable phosphoribulokinase. To measure the time required to activate these two forms, they were separately mixed with reduced thioredoxins. At different times of incubation, an aliquot was withdrawn, and its activity was measured. In both case, an increase in activity was observed. The rates increased exponentially with incubation time before reaching a plateau value (Fig.8). The amplitudes of these activation processes were slightly different, whereas the time constant for the activation of the enzyme inserted in the complex was higher (2 min−1) than that of the free enzyme (0.07 min−1). Modifications of the kinetic properties of multienzyme complexes have been described (8.Gontero B. Mulliert G. Rault M. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 38.Hensley P. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1988; 29: 35-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 39.Clarke F.M. Master J.C.

The results presented here show that activation of phosphoribulokinase by thioredoxins is altered when the enzyme is embedded in a complex. Phosphoribulokinase in the complex form is more easily activated by thioredoxin than is the dissociated enzyme. It is likely that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase dictates a conformation to phosphoribulokinase that is more amenable to thioredoxin activation. The time required to activate this enzyme within the complex is shorter (about 20 s) than that required to activate its dissociated form (about 10 min). This time is comparable to the induction time (about 30 s) of phosphoribulokinase activity in crude extracts of C. reinhardtii following dark-light transition (43.Farr T.J. Huppe C.H. Turpin D.H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 105: 1037-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the reduction process of phosphoribulokinase operates with the greatest efficiency via hydrophobic interactions. This efficiency is the consequence of a change of conformation that can be induced by chaotropic agents, organic solvents, and high pressure (44.Wolosiuk R.A. Corley E. Crawford N.A. Buchanan B.B. FEBS Lett. 1985; 189: 212-216Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 45.Prat-Gay G. Paladini Jr., A. Stein M. Wolosiuk R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20913-20921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions are good candidates for these effects in vivo. However, most experiments on phosphoribulokinase activation by thioredoxins have been performed with the stable, isolated enzyme (1.Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. Arch. Bioch. Biophys. 1978; 189: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,12.Milanez S. Mural R.J. Hartman F.C. J. Biol.

Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 3333-3335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A new feature of the form embedded within the complex is the sigmoid curve obtained for its steady-state rate as a function of thioredoxin concentration. This curve can be explained by our proposed model, which involves a slow dissociation of the complex in the reaction mixture, and the binding of thioredoxin to the different forms of phosphoribulokinase. Whether or not this sigmoidicity is of physiological relevance, it results in a fine regulation of phosphoribulokinase within the complex. Although the organization of the Calvin cycle is widely accepted, the regulation of these structures has been little studied. This paper shows that heterologous interactions are responsible for kinetic changes and that a physiological advantage might arise from these interactions. It may be that the differences between in vivoand in vitro activities result from interactions in the cell. As shown by Goodsell (46.Goodsell D.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 203-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), macromolecular crowding in vivo favors interactions. The model presented here takes these interactions into account but is probably a simplified scheme because it is likely that, in the cell, these interactions involve more than two enzymes of the Calvin cycle.

We previously suggested an eosinophil-specific mechanism of gp91 phox gene expression. To elucidate the mechanism, we performed functional assays on deletion mutants of the gp91 phox promoter in various types of gp91 phox -expressing cells. A 10-base pair (bp) region from bp −105 to −96 of the promoter activated transcription of the gene in eosinophilic cells, but not in neutrophilic, monocytic, or B-lymphocytic cells. A 2-bp mutation introduced into the GATA site spanning bp −101 to −96 (−98GATA site) of the fragment abolished its activity. Gel shift assays using a GATA competitor and specific antibodies demonstrated that both GATA-1 and GATA-2 specifically bound to the −98GATA site with similar affinities. Individual transfection of GATA-1 and GATA-2 into Jurkat cells, which have neither endogenous GATA-1 nor GATA-2, activated the −105/+12 construct in a −98GATA site-dependent manner. Combined transfection of GATA-1 and GATA-2 activated the promoter less than transfection of GATA-1 alone.

Eosinophils have an important role in the host defense against pathogenic parasites and microorganisms and produce superoxide anion as do other phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages) and B-lymphocytes by means of NADPH oxidase activity (16.Yazdanbakhsh M. Tai P.C. Spry C.J. Gleich G.J. Roos D. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3443-3447PubMed Google Scholar). It has long been thought that the expression mechanism of gp91 phox in eosinophils is the same as that in other phagocytes. However, a restricted expression of gp91 phox in eosinophils from our X-linked chronic granulomatous disease patients (17.Kuribayashi F. Kumatori A. Suzuki S. Nakamura M. Matsumoto T. Tsuji Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) 2D. Roos, unpublished data. implied a certain eosinophil-specific expression mechanism of the gene. No positive regulatory mechanisms of the gene have, however, been shown in eosinophils, although an eosinophil-specific GATA-3 suppression mechanism of the gene was recently suggested by us (18.Sadat M.A. Kumatori A. Suzuki S. Yamaguchi Y. Tsuji Y. Nakamura M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this report, we show the eosinophil-specific regulation of the gp91 phox gene by transcription factors GATA-1 and GATA-2 through the GATA-binding site spanning bp −101 to −96 of the gene. To prepare a differentiated eosinophilic cell line (HL-60-C15E), HL-60-C15 cells (a kind gift from Dr. Y. Yamaguchi, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan), the eosinophil-committed subline of the promyelocytic cell line HL-60, were maintained for >3 months at pH 7.7 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 25 mm EPPS (Sigma). They were then treated with 0.5 mm n-butyrate (Sigma) for 5 days for differentiation into eosinophils (19.Fischkoff S.A. Leuk. Res. 1988; 12: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). HL-60 (Riken Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan), B-lymphocytic HS-Sultan (Japanese Cancer Center Research Resources Bank, Tokyo), and T-lymphocytic Jurkat (given by Dr. K. Furukawa, Nagoya University) cells were cultured at pH 7.2 in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. HL-60 cells were differentiated into neutrophils and monocytes by treatment with 1 μmall-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) and 1 ng/ml recombinant human transforming growth factor-β1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Tokyo) in combination with 0.1 μm vitamin D3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; a gift from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo), respectively, for 3 days (20.Breitan T.R.

COS-7 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (5 × 105) in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin were stained by incubation with an appropriate amount of either one of the following monoclonal antibodies or isotype-matched immunoglobulins on ice for 60 min: R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-interleukin-5 receptor α chain (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD19 (Pharmingen), and R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD14 (Dako Japan, Kyoto, Japan). These are lineage-specific to eosinophils, B-lymphocytes, and monocytes, respectively. Surface gp91 phox of the cells was stained as described above with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated 7D5 (22.Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 3A. Yamauchi, unpublished data. These cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and their fluorescence intensities were analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, La Jolla, CA). Total RNA was prepared from cells with Trizol LS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA (10 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on formaldehyde-containing 0.9% agarose gels, transferred to HybondTM-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo), and fixed by ultraviolet light. Messenger RNAs were detected by hybridization with probes labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following DNAs were used as probes for defining cell lineage: a 780-bp full-length cDNA of human major basic protein (MBP; a gift from Dr. I. Nagaoka, Juntendo University, Tokyo), a 725-bp full-length cDNA of human eosinophil cationic protein cloned by polymerase chain reaction, a 500-bp fragment of eosinophil peroxidase (kindly provided by Dr. Y. Yamaguchi), and a 285-bp cDNA for defensin (human neutrophil peptide-3; kindly supplied by Dr. I. Nagaoka). After hybridization patterns by these probes were visualized on a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad), the membrane was washed to remove the first probes and hybridized with a 32P-labeled 800-bp cDNA of rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the internal control of RNA loading. Plasmids pGV−986/Luc, pGV−301/Luc, and pGV−267/Luc, with promoter fragments of gp91 phox spanning from the corresponding bp positions to bp +12, were prepared by the exonuclease III deletion method (21.Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) from pGV−5635/Luc, which has the fragment of the gene extending from its initiation codon to the upstream bp −5635 at the NcoI site of the firefly luciferase gene in the pGV−B2 vector (Toyoink, Tokyo). For making deletion constructs p−267/Luc, p−115/Luc, p−105/Luc, p−95/Luc, and p−84/Luc, we first made fragments spanning from their corresponding positions to bp +12 by the polymerase chain reaction method using pGV−267/Luc as the template and sets of forward primers with KpnI sites and a reverse primer with a BamHI site. These polymerase chain reaction products were digested withKpnI and BamHI and subcloned into theKpnI- and BglII-digested pXP2N of firefly luciferase reporter gene vector, originating from pXP2 (a kind gift from Dr. Y. Yamaguchi). The order of the restriction sites in the multicloning site of pXP2N (5′-BamHI/KpnI/SmaI/SalI/HindII/XhoI/BglII-3′) is different from that of pXP2 (5′-BamHI/HindIII/SmaI/SalI/KpnI/XhoI/BglII-3′). To make p−986/Luc and p−301/Luc, fragments were cut out from pGV−986/Luc and pGV−301/Luc, respectively, at the KpnI sites of their multicloning site and the bp −137 HindIII site of the gp91 phox gene. The correspondingKpnI/HindIII fragment of the p−267/Luc reporter construct was replaced by either one of the above fragments. For making the mutant reporter plasmid p−105M/Luc, a two-point mutation (GA to CT) was introduced into the bp −100 to −99 sequence of p−105/Luc by polymerase chain reaction using a mutated primer. Each cDNA for human GATA-1 and GATA-2 was inserted into the pEF-MCIneo vector with a forward orientation (24.Visvader J.E. Elefanty A.G. Strasser A. Adams J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4557-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For HL-60-C15E and other differentiated HL-60 cells, cells (5 × 106) were incubated with 20 μg of gp91 phox promoter/firefly luciferase plasmid, 10 μg of carrier Bluescript II KS plasmid, and 3 μg of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter/Renillaluciferase plasmid in 0.25 ml of 20 mm HEPES/RPMI 1640 medium (pH 7.2) at room temperature for 15 min and electroporated at 200 V for 70 ms on an ElectroSquarePorator T820 (BTX, Inc., San Diego, CA). HS-Sultan cells (5 × 106) were incubated with 10 μg of gp91 phox promoter firefly luciferase plasmid and 50 ng of cytomegalo virus promoterRenilla luciferase plasmid as described above, but electroporated with a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 950 microfarads and 310 V. Jurkat cells (5 × 106) were electroporated as described for HS-Sultan cells, but in the presence of 5 μg of firefly luciferase plasmid and 20 ng ofRenilla luciferase plasmid at 950 microfarads and 280 V. After HL-60-C15E, HL-60, and HS-Sultan, Jurkat cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and 95% air for 6, 6, 10, and 24 h, respectively, their reporter activities were measured as described previously (14.Suzuki S. Kumatori A. Haagen I.A. Fujii Y. Sadat M.A. Jun H.L. Tsuji Y. Roos D. Nakamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6085-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the case of cotransfection experiments, various amounts of human GATA expression plasmids were transfected with 5 μg of reporter plasmid into 5 × 106 Jurkat cells. Prior to nuclear extraction, COS-7 cells (107) were transfected with 4 μg of GATA-1 or GATA-2 plasmid in 5 ml of Eagle's minimal essential medium by 20 nmol of L1-Liposome (kindly supplied by Dai-ichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo) for 8 h and cultured in 15 ml of 10% fetal calf serum/Eagle's minimal essential medium for 40 h. Preparation of nuclear protein extracts, labeling of the double-stranded oligonucleotides from bp −115 to −90 of the human gp91 phox gene for the probe, and EMSAs were performed as described previously (14.Suzuki S. Kumatori A. Haagen I.A. Fujii Y. Sadat M.A. Jun H.L. Tsuji Y. Roos D. Nakamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6085-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 0.5–14 μg of nuclear protein extracts, 10,000 cpm of each radiolabeled probe equivalent to 1.16 fmol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm spermidine was incubated on ice for 15 min. In competition assays, a 300-molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides was added prior to the addition of the probe to the mixture, which was then preincubated on ice for 15 min. For the inhibition assay with antibodies, an aliquot of nuclear extracts was incubated on ice with 2–4 μg of goat IgG against human GATA-1, murine IgG against human GATA-2, control goat IgG, or control murine IgG for 1 h before the addition of the probe. Both anti-GATA antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Electrophoresis was performed on a native 6% acrylamide gel in 0.4× buffer containing 36 mm Tris, 36 mm boric acid, and 8 mm EDTA (pH 8.3). Upper-strand sequences for the probe and of competitors are as follows: sequence for the probe and of the wild-type competitor (bp −115 to −90 of the normal fragment of the gp91 phox gene), 5′-TATTAGCCAATTTCTGATAAAAGAAA-3′; GATA-binding site competitor of the human T-cell receptor δ gene (25.Redondo J.M. Hata S. Brocklehurst C. Krangel M.S. Science. 1990; 247: 1225-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), 5′-TTATTTAAGTCTTAGTTGTAG-3′; GATA site mutant of the wild-type competitor (−105M), 5′-AATTTCTCTTAAAAGAAAAGGAA-3′; and a heterologous competitor, 5′-CACAACCACATTCAACCTCTGCCACC-3′. The underlined sequence represents mutated bases. Apparent dissociation constants (K d) were determined according to the methods described by Merika and Orkin (26.Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The binding and running conditions were same as those described above. Each fixed amount of nuclear protein extract from COS-7 cells expressing GATA-1 (0.5 μg/20 μl) or GATA-2 (14 μg/20 μl) was incubated on ice with serially diluted labeled probe and incubated for 15 min, which was confirmed to be long enough to bring the reaction to equilibrium. Quantitation of free and bound DNAs was performed with a Molecular Imager FX. Scatchard plots for GATA-1 and GATA-2 were accomplished assuming front counts and specifically retarded counts to be proportional to free and bound concentrations, respectively, and also assuming their binding to one DNA duplex to be 1. Each value shown as the mean ± S.D. was obtained from three or more means of independent duplicates or triplicates. Values of p lower than 0.05 in mostly paired Student's t test were taken to be statistically significant. To analyze an eosinophil-specific cis-element of the gp91 phox promoter, we differentiated HL-60-C15 cells, an eosinophil-committed subline of the promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cell line, by treatment with butyrate under alkaline pH. As shown in Fig.1, these treated cells, but not parental HL-60 cells, expressed mRNAs for eosinophil lineage-specific MBP, eosinophil cationic protein, and eosinophil peroxidase. These results support that the cells are phenotypically eosinophilic. We named the cells HL-60-C15E and used them in further experiments as differentiated human eosinophilic cells. Next, we transiently transfected the p−986/Luc construct, which contains the gp91 phox gene fragment from bp −986 to bp +12 in front of a luciferase reporter gene, into HL-60-C15E cells. As shown in Fig. 2, the p−986/Luc construct had a significantly higher reporter activity than the promoterless pXP2N construct. This result indicates that the bp −986 fragment contains positive regulatory elements for gp91 phox gene expression in eosinophilic cells. To clarify the elements, a series of progressive deletion mutants was generated, and the promoter activity of each was examined (Fig. 2). Deletions of sequences −986/−302 (between bp −986 and −301), −301/−116, and −115/−106 produced no significant changes in promoter activity (p−301/Luc, p−115/Luc, and p−105/Luc). However, a further 10-bp deletion from bp −105 to −96 significantly decreased promoter activity by 40% (p < 0.01; compare p−105/Luc and p−95/Luc). An additional 11-bp deletion resulted in a further decrease in activity (p < 0.01; compare p−95/Luc and p−84/Luc). These results suggest that positive regulatory elements exist in the regions from bp −105 to −96 and bp −95 to −85 of the gp91 phox promoter. To determine the lineage specificity of the first region from bp −105 to −96, we examined the relative promoter activity of p−105/Lucversus p−95/Luc in non-eosinophilic gp91 phox -expressing cells as well as eosinophilic HL-60-C15E cells (Fig. 3 A). The ratio of the promoter activity of p−105/Luc to that of p−95/Luc was significantly higher than 1.0 in HL-60-C15E cells (1.7 ± 0.19;p < 0.001), but not in neutrophilic HL-60, monocytic HL-60, or B-lymphocytic HS-Sultan cells. Therefore, at least one eosinophil-specific positive cis-element should exist in the region from bp −105 to −96 of the gp91 phox promoter. On the other hand, the −95/−84 region had no specificity for eosinophilic cells (data not shown). The lineage specificities of these gp91 phox -expressing cells were confirmed by particular expressions of CD14, CD19, and the interleukin-5 receptor on surfaces of transforming growth factor-β1/vitamin D3-treated HL-60, HS-Sultan, and HL-60-C15E cells, respectively, and the only significant expression of defensin mRNA in all-trans-retinoic acid-treated HL-60 cells (Fig.3 B). To determine cis-elements in the −105/−96 region of the gp91 phox promoter, we searched transcription factor-binding sites in the region. A sequence between bp −101 and −96 (5′-TGATAA-3′) perfectly matched with the GATA consensus sequence ((A/T)GATA(A/G)) (27.Evans T. Reitman M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5976-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). To determine whether this putative GATA-binding site (−98GATA site) actually contributed to activation of the gp91 phox promoter by the −105/−96 region, we examined the effect of a GATA site mutation (GA to CT) that abolishes the ability to bind GATA proteins from a GATA site (26.Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) on activation in HL-60-C15E cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the mutation completely abolished all the activity dependent on the region, clearly demonstrating that the −98GATA site is the essentialcis-element for the eosinophil-specific activation of the gp91 phox promoter by the −105/−96 region. To identify nuclear protein complexes that specifically bind to the −98GATA site in HL-60-C15E cells, we performed EMSAs with the probe from bp −115 to −90 encompassing the −98GATA site (Fig. 5). Two nuclear protein complexes (C1 and C2) specifically bound to the probe because binding was abolished by a 300-fold molar excess of wild-type competitor with sequence identical to that of the probe, but not by an excess of the heterologous sequence oligonucleotide (lanes 1–3). Binding was abolished to a similar extent even by a 120-fold molar excess of wild-type competitor (data not shown). An excess of GATA site-mutated oligonucleotide spanning bp −105 to −85 of the promoter (Mt), which has the same mutation as p−105M/Luc in Fig. 4, failed to abolish the binding of the C1 and C2 complexes (lane 4), indicating that these protein complexes bind to the −98GATA site. An excess of a GATA-binding sequence derived from the T-cell receptor δ gene completely abolished the binding of these complexes to the probe (lane 5), as did the wild-type competitor, suggesting that the C1 and C2 complexes include members of the GATA family. To further characterize these complexes, we performed gel shift immunoassays with anti-GATA-1 and anti-GATA-2 antibodies because mRNAs of GATA-1 and GATA-2 are abundantly expressed in HL-60-C15E cells as well as in human peripheral eosinophils (28.Zon L.I. Yamaguchi Y. Yee K. Albee E.A. Kimura A. Bennett J.C. Orkin S.H. Ackerman S.J. Blood. 1993; 81: 3234-3241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 C1 and the lower part of C2 (L) disappeared when anti-GATA-1 antibody was added (lane 6). The upper part of C2 (U), but not others, was abolished by the addition of anti-GATA-2 antibody (lane 7). The formation of both C1 and C2 bands was mostly inhibited by a combination of both antibodies (lane 8). Neither control goat IgG (lane 9) nor control murine IgG (lane 10) disrupted the complexes. These results suggest that C1 and C2 include GATA-1 alone and GATA-1 and GATA-2, respectively. Although a small amount of mRNA for GATA-3 was expressed in HL-60-C15E cells as well as in peripheral eosinophils, an antibody against GATA-3 exhibited no effects on C1 or C2 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that GATA-1 and GATA-2 specifically bind to the −98GATA site of the gp91 phox promoter in HL-60-C15E cells. The different mobilities of GATA-1 and GATA-2 shown above are consistent with those reported by Briegelet al. (29.Briegel K. Lim K.C. Plank C. Beug H. Engel J.D. Zenke M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1097-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and Yamaguchi et al. (30.Yamaguchi Y. Ackerman S.J. Minegishi N. Takiguchi M. Yamamoto M. Suda T. Blood. 1998; 91: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the individual binding of GATA-1 and GATA-2 to the −98GATA site in the gp91 phox promoter, EMSA was performed with nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells that transiently expressed either human GATA-1 or GATA-2 cDNA and the probe spanning bp −115 to −90 of the gp91 phox promoter (Fig.6). The binding of GATA-1 (G1) and GATA-2 (G2) was abolished by the unlabeled wild-type competitor (Wt; lanes 3 and 10) and the GATA-binding site of the T-cell receptor δ gene (GA;lanes 5 and 12), but not by a heterologous sequence (He; lanes 4 and 11) or the GATA site-mutated competitor (Mt; lanes 6 and13). Furthermore, the GATA-1 complexes were supershifted by anti-GATA-1 antibody (SS; lane 8), and the GATA-2 complexes were abolished by anti-GATA-2 antibody (lane 15), contrasting with no effects by corresponding control antibodies (lanes 7 and 14). Nuclear extracts from untransfected COS-7 cells made no such complexes (lane 1). These results confirm that GATA-1 and GATA-2 specifically bind to the −98GATA site and support the use of these nuclear extracts in the kinetic analysis of the interaction between the site and these GATA proteins. To determine the relative binding affinities of GATA-1 and GATA-2 for the −98GATA site, we determined the apparent K dvalues from Scatchard plots obtained from EMSA data (Fig.7). The amount of bound probe increased with increases in the concentration of the probe (panels A1and B1). Scatchard plots for GATA-1 (panel A2) and GATA-2 (panel B2) revealed their apparentK d values to be 0.13 and 0.10 nm, respectively, suggesting that both GATA proteins have similar affinities for the −98GATA site. Accordingly, GATA-1 and GATA-2 may efficiently compete with each other for binding to the site. The above results indicate that both GATA-1 and GATA-2 similarly bind to the −98GATA site of the gp91 phox promoter. To determine whether either one or both of the GATA proteins transactivate the gp91 phox promoter, we individually cotransfected various amounts of their expression vectors with wild-type p−105/Luc into Jurkat cells, which express neither of the endogenous GATA proteins (Fig. 8). Up to 4 μg cotransfected GATA-1 and GATA-2 cDNAs dose-dependently and significantly (p < 0.01 and 0.05, respectively) increased gp91 phox promoter activity. At doses higher than 6 μg, the activity decreased similarly in both plasmids (panel A). The GA-to-CT mutation at the −98GATA site of p−105/Luc significantly decreased the GATA-1- and GATA-2-mediated promoter activities, to 30.5 ± 13.6 and 16.4 ± 16.2%, respectively (panels B and C). These results indicate that individually expressed GATA-1 and GATA-2 transactivate the gp91 phox promoter mostly through the −98GATA site. To clarify each role of GATA-1 and GATA-2 in cells expressing both GATA proteins as eosinophils, GATA-1 and GATA-2 plasmids were cotransfected individually or in combination with the wild-type p−105/Luc reporter construct into Jurkat cells (Fig. 9). The amount of GATA-1 plasmid and that of GATA-2 were fixed to 2 μg, which gave 85 and 80%, respectively, of their maximal activities (Fig.8 A). Transiently expressed GATA-1 (Fig. 9 A,second bar) produced a (15.5 ± 1.5)-fold increase above vehicle activity (p < 0.001 versusthe first bar), and transiently expressed GATA-2 (third bar) produced a (1.0 ± 0.2)-fold increase (p < 0.001 versus the first bar). The combined expression of the two GATA proteins (fourth bar) exhibited an (8.3 ± 0.6)-fold increase, which is significantly lower than the increase obtained by GATA-1 alone (p < 0.005), suggesting that GATA-2 inhibits the transactivation of the gp91 phox promoter by GATA-1. This was confirmed in Fig. 9 B. The amount of GATA-1 plasmid was also fixed here to 2 μg, but the amount of GATA-2 plasmid was increased from 0 to 4 μg to reach its maximal activity (Fig. 8 A). Total amounts of GATA plasmids were 6 μg or less for avoiding their inhibitory effects. The combined expression of increased amounts of GATA-2 along with a fixed amount of GATA-1 impaired the ability of GATA-1 to transactivate the gp91 phox promoter in a dose-dependent fashion. Therefore, GATA-1 is the principal activator for the gp91 phox promoter, and GATA-2 is a relative competitive inhibitor in the presence of both GATA proteins, as in eosinophils. In a previous report, we suggested the existence of an eosinophil-specific mechanism of gp91 phox gene expression (17.Kuribayashi F. Kumatori A. Suzuki S. Nakamura M. Matsumoto T. Tsuji Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that the −98GATA site works as a positivecis-element for the gp91 phox promoter in an eosinophil lineage, but not in other lineages expressing gp91 phox. EMSAs have shown that GATA-1 and GATA-2 are the only specific DNA-binding proteins for the GATA site in eosinophilic cells. These results suggest that expression of the gp91 phox gene is regulated by the combination of GATA-1 and GATA-2 through the −98GATA site, particularly in eosinophils. We also found that GATA-1 and GATA-2 individually bind to the −98GATA site with similar apparent dissociation constants and can individually work as positive regulators for the gp91 phox gene. However, GATA-2 inhibits the transactivation of the gene by GATA-1 in coexisting conditions, as in eosinophils. Taken together, our findings suggest that GATA-1 works as a principal activator and that GATA-2 works as a competitive inhibitor of GATA-1 for the expression of the gp91 phox gene in eosinophils. The negative regulation of the gene by GATA-2 can be done simply by competitive binding to the −98GATA site with GATA-1 with an assumption that GATA-2 is one order less effective than GATA-1 for the transactivation of the gene. However, inhibition of the interaction between GATA-1 and some protein factors by GATA-2 may also contribute to decreasing the GATA-1-dependent promoter activity of the gene. At least six members have been identified in the GATA transcription factor family, which recognizes the consensus motif ((A/T)GATA(A/G)) through a highly conserved zinc finger DNA-binding domain (27.Evans T. Reitman M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5976-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic tissues, GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 are expressed in distinct but overlapping patterns (31.Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar): GATA-1 in erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils; GATA-2 in all these cells and neutrophils; and GATA-3 in T-lymphocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils. Only eosinophils among gp91 phox -expressing lineages express GATA-1. We can therefore conclude that the positive regulation of the gp91 phox gene by GATA-1 is an eosinophil-specific mechanism. We can also conclude that the negative regulation by GATA-2 is unique in eosinophils, which are the only cells that express both GATA-1 and GATA-2 in gp91 phox -expressing cells. Recently, mechanisms for positive regulation by GATA-1 have been detected in two eosinophil-specific genes, the chicken EOS47gene (32.McNagny K.M. Sieweke M.H. Doderlein G. Graf T. Nerlov C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and the human MBP gene (30.Yamaguchi Y. Ackerman S.J. Minegishi N. Takiguchi M. Yamamoto M. Suda T. Blood. 1998; 91: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MBP gene is, in particular, regulated positively by GATA-1 and negatively by GATA-2, as is the mechanism presented here for the gp91 phox gene (30.Yamaguchi Y. Ackerman S.J. Minegishi N. Takiguchi M. Yamamoto M. Suda T. Blood. 1998; 91: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although GATA-2 by itself cannot activate the MBP gene. Different from theEOS47 and MBP genes, the gp91 phox gene is not specifically expressed in eosinophil lineages, but its expression is definitely supported by GATA-1, which is particular to eosinophils in gp91 phox -expressing cells. The gp91 phox gene is highly expressed in terminally differentiated peripheral eosinophils,2 which still express GATA-1 at a high level (28.Zon L.I. Yamaguchi Y. Yee K. Albee E.A. Kimura A. Bennett J.C. Orkin S.H. Ackerman S.J. Blood. 1993; 81: 3234-3241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the MBP gene at a residual level (33.Gruart V. Truong M.J. Plumas J. Zandecki M. Kusnierz J.P. Prin L. Vinatier D. Capron A. Capron M. Blood. 1992; 79: 2592-2597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Li M.S. Sun L. Satoh T. Fisher L.M. Spry C.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Some critical factor(s) for the expression of the MBP gene, but not that of the gp91 phox gene, might have disappeared in the late stage of terminal differentiation to peripheral eosinophils. The expression of the gp91 phox gene is regulated by various endogenous and exogenous mediators, including interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and lipopolysaccharide (35.Newburger P.E. Dai Q. Whitney C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16171-16177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some factors related to allergy and parasitic infections may specifically regulate the gp91 phox gene in eosinophils through the GATA-1 system. How does GATA-1 activate the gp91 phox gene? GATA-1 directly interacts with transcription factors such as Sp1, EKLF (36.Gregory R.C. Taxman D.J. Seshasayee D. Kensinger M.H. Bieker J.J. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and FOG-1 (37.Tsang A.P.

An acetylase of p300/CBP (38.Blobel G.A. Nakajima T. Eckner R. Montminy M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) also directly associates with GATA-1 as a coactivator. The p300/CBP acetylates GATA-1 and increases its binding to DNA, resulting in stimulation of GATA-1-dependent transcription (39.Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 40.Hung H.L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This mechanism of the ubiquitous cofactor may participate in the activation of the gp91 phox promoter by GATA-1. Expression of myeloid-specific genes is regulated by a combination of transcription factors generally expressed in hematopoietic cells (c-Myb, AML-1/CBFβ, and Ets-1) and lineage-specific or -restricted factors (GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBP) (23.Kulessa H. Frampton J. Graf T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1250-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Recently, Yamaguchi et al. (30.Yamaguchi Y. Ackerman S.J. Minegishi N. Takiguchi M. Yamamoto M. Suda T. Blood. 1998; 91: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated the transactivation of the MBP P2 promoter by C/EBPs, especially by C/EBPβ. C/EBPβ may also play a role in the activation of the gp91 phox promoter in eosinophils because possible binding sites of C/EBP are found in the promoter. Previously, we reported the deficient expression of gp91 phox in the neutrophils, monocytes, and B-lymphocytes, but not in the eosinophils, of an X-linked chronic granulomatous disease patient (17.Kuribayashi F. Kumatori A. Suzuki S. Nakamura M. Matsumoto T. Tsuji Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Further analyses suggested that the deficient binding of PU.1 to the gp91 phox promoter due to the point mutation (−53C to T) at its PU.1 motif results in the deficient expression of the gp91 phox gene in the patient (14.Suzuki S. Kumatori A. Haagen I.A. Fujii Y. Sadat M.A. Jun H.L. Tsuji Y. Roos D. Nakamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6085-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that eosinophils have their own gp91 phox gene expression mechanism independent of PU.1. The GATA-mediated mechanism presented here is a strong candidate for it because the transactivation of the gp91 phox gene by a combination of GATA-1 and GATA-2 has occurred in Jurkat cells, which have no PU.1.

Mice deficient in PDGF B-chain or PDGFR β exhibit an abnormal glomerular phenotype characterized by total lack of mesangial cells. In this study, we localized PDGFR β in the developing rat kidney and explored the biological effects of PDGF in metanephric mesenchymal cells in an attempt to determine the mechanism by which PDGF regulates mesangial cell development. Immunohistochemical and in situhybridization studies of rat embryonic kidneys reveal that PDGFR β localizes to undifferentiated metanephric mesenchyme and is later expressed in the cleft of the comma-shaped and S-shaped bodies and in more mature glomeruli in a mesangial distribution. We also isolated and characterized cells from rat metanephric mesenchyme. Metanephric mesenchymal cells express vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin but not cytokeratin. These cells also express functional PDGFR β, as demonstrated by autophosphorylation of the receptor as well as activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase in response to PDGF B-chain homodimer. PDGF B-chain also induces migration and proliferation of metanephric mesenchymal cells. Taken together with the fact that PDGF B-chain is expressed in the glomerular epithelium and mesangial area, as demonstrated in the human embryonic kidney, we suggest that PDGF B-chain acts in a paracrine fashion to stimulate the migration and proliferation of mesangial cell precursors from undifferentiated metanephric mesenchyme to the mesangial area.

In human embryo at 54–105 days of gestation, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that PDGFR β is expressed in the undifferentiated metanephric mesenchyme and in maturing glomeruli, whereas platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain is expressed in epithelial cells and the mesangium of maturing glomeruli (1.Alpers C.E. Seifert R.A. Hudkins K.L. Johnson R.J. Bower-Pope D.F. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 390-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This spatial and temporal distribution of PDGF B-chain and PDGFR β suggests a role for PDGF in the development of glomerular cells, including mesangial cells. The roles of PDGF B-chain and PDGFR β in mesangial cell development have been conclusively demonstrated in two recent studies utilizing mice carrying mutations in either PDGF B-chain or PDGFR β. The kidney phenotype in these mice exhibit glomeruli that lack mesangial cells and structural disorganization of the glomerular capillaries (2.Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 3.Leveen P. Pekny M. Gebre-Medhin S. Swohn B. Larrson E. Betsholtz C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1875-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar).PDGF B-chain is a potent mitogen for most if not all mesenchymal cells. In the mature adult kidney, platelet-derived growth factor B-chain homodimer (PDGF BB) is mitogenic for mesangial cells, interstitial fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells. PDGF also stimulates mesangial cell migration in vitro (4.Barnes J.L. Hevey K.A. Lab. Invest. 1990; 62: 379-382PubMed Google Scholar) and has been implicated as a mediator in inflammatory and progressive glomerular and interstitial diseases. Activation of PDGFR β represents a major stimulus for proliferation and migration of these cells (5.Abboud H.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Binding of PDGF BB results in stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase and autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine residue (6.Abboud H.E. Bhandari B. Ghosh Choudhury G. Bonventre J. Schlondrof D. Molecular Nephrology, Kidney Function in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 573-590Google Scholar). Studies using PDGF receptor mutants have identified a role for phospholipase C γ and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) in proliferation and migration of specific cell types. Because PDGF BB appears to be essential for mesangial cell development, we examined the temporal and spatial localization of PDGFR β by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in the developing rat kidney. Our results showed a pattern of PDGFR-β protein and mRNA staining suggestive of mesangial cell migration and proliferation as distinctive cellular events during glomerulogenesis in the developing kidney. To examine the effect of PDGF B-chain on metanephric mesenchymal (MM) cells in vitro, we isolated and propagated MM cells from 13 day rat embryos and examined the effect of PDGF BB on cell migration, proliferation, and PI3-kinase activity. The data demonstrate that MM cells express functional PDGFR β and that PDGF BB induces migration and proliferation of these cells. Migration of MM cells is dependent on PI3-kinase activation. Directed migration of a subset of mesenchymal stem cells into the cleft of the maturing glomerulus, where PDGF BB is synthesized, and subsequent proliferation are potential mechanisms by which PDGF BB acting on PDGFR β contributes to mesangial cell development.DISCUSSIONThe spatial and temporal distribution of PDGF B-chain and PDGFR β suggests a role for PDGF in the development of mesangial cell lineage. In human kidney, utilizing immunohistochemical techniques, Alpers et al. (1.Alpers C.E. Seifert R.A. Hudkins K.L. Johnson R.J. Bower-Pope D.F. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 390-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) localized PDGF B-chain to the differentiated epithelium of glomerular precursors, including the S-shaped body, and to the mesangium of mature glomeruli. PDGFR β, on the other hand, localized to the undifferentiated mesenchyme and to cells within the glomerular tuft in more mature glomeruli (1.Alpers C.E. Seifert R.A. Hudkins K.L. Johnson R.J. Bower-Pope D.F. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 390-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These investigators suggested that this pattern of localization implicates PDGF in the development of glomerular microvascular cells. At early stages of metanephric development, PDGF B chain released by differentiating epithelial cells may act on metanephric mesenchymal cells in a paracrine manner to stimulate their migration to the glomerular tuft. On the other hand, in more mature glomeruli, because the ligand and the receptor are localized in the same cells, PDGF BB may act on glomerular cells in a an autocrine manner. Our data utilizing both immunohistochemistry and in situhybridization in the developing rat kidney are in agreement with the immunohistochemical studies by Alpers et al. (1.Alpers C.E. Seifert R.A. Hudkins K.L. Johnson R.J. Bower-Pope D.F. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 390-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) in the human and primate kidneys and with more recent data in the mouse kidney (25.Seifert R.A. Alpers C.E. Bowen-Pope D.F. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 731-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).There are several potential mechanisms by which PDGF BB homodimer may act on metanephric mesenchymal cells and thereby contribute to the differentiation of a subset of these cells to mature differentiated mesangial cell phenotype. Two essential mechanisms that are pertinent to development include cell migration and cell proliferation. We isolated metanephric mesenchymal cells, established these cells in culture, and examined the effect of PDGF BB homodimer on migration, proliferation, and PI3-kinase activity. Undifferentiated embryonic metanephric mesenchymal cells are multipotent and are capable of differentiating into different cell types that will populate the mature nephron. Subconfluent cells retain several characteristics of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells seen in the metanephric blastema. The cells stain positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin. In metanephric organ explant experiments, vimentin expression is lost in the mesenchyme on the third to fourth day, whereas cytokeratin expression begins on the third day (16.Saxen, L., Koskimies, O., Lahti, A., Miettinen, H., Papola, J., and Wartiovaara, J. Advances in Morphogenesis(Abercombie, M., Brachet J., and King, T. J., eds) Vol. 7, pp. 251–293, Academic Press, LondonGoogle Scholar). These characteristics indicate that MM cells are early embryonic stem cells with mesenchymal features. Furthermore, these cells are negative for D. biflorus, a specific marker of ureteric bud cells, an indication of the absence of ureteric bud cell contamination.Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that all metanephric cells in culture express PDGFR β. In the adult kidney, PDGFR β is expressed in mesangial cells, interstitial fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells at low abundancy. The precise origin of mesangial cells is not known. It is most likely that at least a subpopulation of MM cells eventually differentiate not only to mesangial cells but also to smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Recent studies have reexamined the origin of glomerular microvascular cells using both cell marker techniques and grafting procedures and suggested that mesangial cells arise from metanephric mesenchyme (17.Hyink D.P. Tucker D.C. St. John P.L. Leardkamolkarn V. Accavitti M.A. Abrass C.K. Abrahamson D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 39: F886-F899Google Scholar). Nephron epithelium and interstitial stromal cells are likely to have a common cellular origin in the renal mesenchyme (10.Herzlinger D. Koseki C. Mikawa T. Al-Awqati Q. Development. 1992; 114: 565-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following induction, embryonic cells develop into distinct cell types influenced by their position in the primitive nephron unit. Tagged cells derived from early uninduced mesenchymal cells can populate two adjacent nephrons, indicating that the uninduced cell or its immediate descendants are able to migrate to join an adjacent nephron (10.Herzlinger D. Koseki C. Mikawa T. Al-Awqati Q. Development. 1992; 114: 565-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultimate development of specialized cells is dependent on multiple biological processes, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation. PDGFR β activation has been shown to induce proliferation of mesenchymal cells. PDGFR β stimulation is also known to cause a profound effect on the arrangement of actin filaments that lead to the formation of edge ruffles. Similar formations are noticed on the leading edge of migrating cells, allowing reshuffling of membranes during migration (18.Stoker M. Gherardi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 81-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 19.Wennstrom S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.K. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing a PDGFR β mutants devoid of the binding sites for PI3-kinase,i.e. lacking Tyr-740 and Tyr-751, show no mitogenic or chemotactic responses to PDGF (12.Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 19.Wennstrom S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.K. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role for PI3-kinase in cell migration. Here, we demonstrate that rat MM cells express functional PDGFR β. Binding studies showed that these cells bind to PDGF BB in a saturable manner, and Scatchard analysis is consistent with predominantly a single class of receptor with aK D of 68 pm and total binding sites of 3.65 × 104/cell. PDGFR β was activated as evidenced by phosphorylation of an 185-kDa protein corresponding to the PDGFR β after treatment of these cells with PDGF BB. We also demonstrate that PDGF BB induces directed migration of MM cells in a dose-dependent manner. PDGF BB is also mitogenic causing an 8-fold increase in DNA synthesis. Of particular interest is that migration occurred at very low concentration of PDGF BB(0.1 ng/ml), with its maximum effect at 1 ng/ml, whereas the mitogenic effect occurred at a higher concentration (25 ng/ml). Such differential sensitivity raises the possibility that PDGF BB first induces migration of a subset of MM cells expressing PDGFR β. Once these cells are in the developing glomerular cleft, they are exposed to locally secreted PDGF, from which a higher concentration of PDGF BB can be achieved and induce cell proliferation.We also show that the effect of PDGF BB is mediated through activation of PI3-kinase. This is consistent with the in vitro studies with PDGFR β mutants demonstrating a role for PI3-kinase in mediating cell migration and proliferation in response to PDGF (13.Choudhury G.G. Biswas P.

It should be emphasized that the role of PI3-kinase in cell migration is cell-specific, because in smooth muscle cells, PI3-kinase does not mediate migration (26.Higaki M. Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Shimokado K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29342-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PDGF BB treatment resulted in increases of 107- and 118-fold in PI3-kinase activation in antiphosphotyrosine and PDGFR β immunoprecipitates respectively. Treatment of these cell with Wortmannin, a potent PI3-kinase inhibitor, completely reversed PDGF BB-induced migration.In conclusion, we have isolated and propagated rat metanephric mesenchymal cells with functional PDGFR β. These cells represent an early embryonic cells that express the characteristics of mesenchymal cells with no evidence of epithelial differentiation. These cells can be utilized to study the differentiation of the different cells that populate most segments of the mature nephron and to dissect the cellular mechanisms involved in differentiation and other biological responses. We provide here the first evidence that cultured cells from metanephric mesenchyme express functional PDGFR β. Activation of these receptors with subsequent migration and proliferation represent at least one mechanism by which PDGF BB may contribute to mesangial cell development and glomerulogenesis. It remains to be determined, using mesangial cell-specific markers, whether PDGF BB can induce the differentiation of a subpopulation of these precursors into mesangial cells and what genetic programs are required for ultimate differentiation to a mature mesangial cell phenotype. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFR β)1 is abundantly expressed in a variety of mesenchymal cells in mid gestation embryo.

In metanephric organ explant experiments, vimentin expression is lost in the mesenchyme on the third to fourth day, whereas cytokeratin expression begins on the third day (16.Saxen, L., Koskimies, O., Lahti, A., Miettinen, H., Papola, J., and Wartiovaara, J. Advances in Morphogenesis(Abercombie, M., Brachet J., and King, T. J., eds) Vol. 7, pp. 251–293, Academic Press, LondonGoogle Scholar). These characteristics indicate that MM cells are early embryonic stem cells with mesenchymal features. Furthermore, these cells are negative for D. biflorus, a specific marker of ureteric bud cells, an indication of the absence of ureteric bud cell contamination.Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that all metanephric cells in culture express PDGFR β. In the adult kidney, PDGFR β is expressed in mesangial cells, interstitial fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells at low abundancy. The precise origin of mesangial cells is not known. It is most likely that at least a subpopulation of MM cells eventually differentiate not only to mesangial cells but also to smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Recent studies have reexamined the origin of glomerular microvascular cells using both cell marker techniques and grafting procedures and suggested that mesangial cells arise from metanephric mesenchyme (17.Hyink D.P. Tucker D.C. St. John P.L. Leardkamolkarn V. Accavitti M.A. Abrass C.K. Abrahamson D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 39: F886-F899Google Scholar). Nephron epithelium and interstitial stromal cells are likely to have a common cellular origin in the renal mesenchyme (10.Herzlinger D. Koseki C. Mikawa T. Al-Awqati Q. Development. 1992; 114: 565-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following induction, embryonic cells develop into distinct cell types influenced by their position in the primitive nephron unit. Tagged cells derived from early uninduced mesenchymal cells can populate two adjacent nephrons, indicating that the uninduced cell or its immediate descendants are able to migrate to join an adjacent nephron (10.Herzlinger D. Koseki C. Mikawa T. Al-Awqati Q. Development. 1992; 114: 565-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultimate development of specialized cells is dependent on multiple biological processes, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation. PDGFR β activation has been shown to induce proliferation of mesenchymal cells. PDGFR β stimulation is also known to cause a profound effect on the arrangement of actin filaments that lead to the formation of edge ruffles. Similar formations are noticed on the leading edge of migrating cells, allowing reshuffling of membranes during migration (18.Stoker M. Gherardi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 81-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 19.Wennstrom S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.K. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing a PDGFR β mutants devoid of the binding sites for PI3-kinase,i.e. lacking Tyr-740 and Tyr-751, show no mitogenic or chemotactic responses to PDGF (12.Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 19.Wennstrom S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.K. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role for PI3-kinase in cell migration. Here, we demonstrate that rat MM cells express functional PDGFR β. Binding studies showed that these cells bind to PDGF BB in a saturable manner, and Scatchard analysis is consistent with predominantly a single class of receptor with aK D of 68 pm and total binding sites of 3.65 × 104/cell. PDGFR β was activated as evidenced by phosphorylation of an 185-kDa protein corresponding to the PDGFR β after treatment of these cells with PDGF BB. We also demonstrate that PDGF BB induces directed migration of MM cells in a dose-dependent manner. PDGF BB is also mitogenic causing an 8-fold increase in DNA synthesis. Of particular interest is that migration occurred at very low concentration of PDGF BB(0.1 ng/ml), with its maximum effect at 1 ng/ml, whereas the mitogenic effect occurred at a higher concentration (25 ng/ml). Such differential sensitivity raises the possibility that PDGF BB first induces migration of a subset of MM cells expressing PDGFR β. Once these cells are in the developing glomerular cleft, they are exposed to locally secreted PDGF, from which a higher concentration of PDGF BB can be achieved and induce cell proliferation.We also show that the effect of PDGF BB is mediated through activation of PI3-kinase. This is consistent with the in vitro studies with PDGFR β mutants demonstrating a role for PI3-kinase in mediating cell migration and proliferation in response to PDGF (13.Choudhury G.G. Biswas P.

It should be emphasized that the role of PI3-kinase in cell migration is cell-specific, because in smooth muscle cells, PI3-kinase does not mediate migration (26.Higaki M. Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Shimokado K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29342-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PDGF BB treatment resulted in increases of 107- and 118-fold in PI3-kinase activation in antiphosphotyrosine and PDGFR β immunoprecipitates respectively. Treatment of these cell with Wortmannin, a potent PI3-kinase inhibitor, completely reversed PDGF BB-induced migration.In conclusion, we have isolated and propagated rat metanephric mesenchymal cells with functional PDGFR β. These cells represent an early embryonic cells that express the characteristics of mesenchymal cells with no evidence of epithelial differentiation. These cells can be utilized to study the differentiation of the different cells that populate most segments of the mature nephron and to dissect the cellular mechanisms involved in differentiation and other biological responses. We provide here the first evidence that cultured cells from metanephric mesenchyme express functional PDGFR β. Activation of these receptors with subsequent migration and proliferation represent at least one mechanism by which PDGF BB may contribute to mesangial cell development and glomerulogenesis. It remains to be determined, using mesangial cell-specific markers, whether PDGF BB can induce the differentiation of a subpopulation of these precursors into mesangial cells and what genetic programs are required for ultimate differentiation to a mature mesangial cell phenotype. The spatial and temporal distribution of PDGF B-chain and PDGFR β suggests a role for PDGF in the development of mesangial cell lineage. In human kidney, utilizing immunohistochemical techniques, Alpers et al. (1.Alpers C.E. Seifert R.A. Hudkins K.L. Johnson R.J. Bower-Pope D.F. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 390-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) localized PDGF B-chain to the differentiated epithelium of glomerular precursors, including the S-shaped body, and to the mesangium of mature glomeruli. PDGFR β, on the other hand, localized to the undifferentiated mesenchyme and to cells within the glomerular tuft in more mature glomeruli (1.Alpers C.E. Seifert R.A. Hudkins K.L. Johnson R.J. Bower-Pope D.F. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 390-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These investigators suggested that this pattern of localization implicates PDGF in the development of glomerular microvascular cells. At early stages of metanephric development, PDGF B chain released by differentiating epithelial cells may act on metanephric mesenchymal cells in a paracrine manner to stimulate their migration to the glomerular tuft. On the other hand, in more mature glomeruli, because the ligand and the receptor are localized in the same cells, PDGF BB may act on glomerular cells in a an autocrine manner. Our data utilizing both immunohistochemistry and in situhybridization in the developing rat kidney are in agreement with the immunohistochemical studies by Alpers et al. (1.Alpers C.E. Seifert R.A. Hudkins K.L. Johnson R.J. Bower-Pope D.F. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 390-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) in the human and primate kidneys and with more recent data in the mouse kidney (25.Seifert R.A. Alpers C.E. Bowen-Pope D.F. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 731-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There are several potential mechanisms by which PDGF BB homodimer may act on metanephric mesenchymal cells and thereby contribute to the differentiation of a subset of these cells to mature differentiated mesangial cell phenotype. Two essential mechanisms that are pertinent to development include cell migration and cell proliferation. We isolated metanephric mesenchymal cells, established these cells in culture, and examined the effect of PDGF BB homodimer on migration, proliferation, and PI3-kinase activity. Undifferentiated embryonic metanephric mesenchymal cells are multipotent and are capable of differentiating into different cell types that will populate the mature nephron.

https://openalex.org/W2021977049,"In membranes of Acholeplasma laidlawii a single glucosyltransferase step between the major, nonbilayer-prone monoglucosyl-diacylglycerol (MGlcDAG) and the bilayer-forming diglucosyl-diacylglycerol (DGlcDAG) is important for maintenance of lipid phase equilibria and curvature packing stress. This DGlcDAG synthase is activated in a cooperative fashion by phosphatidylglycerol (PG), but in vivo PG amounts are not enough for efficient DGlcDAG synthesis. In vitro, phospholipids with an sn-glycero-3-phosphate backbone, and no positive head group charge, functioned as activators. Different metabolic, soluble phosphates could supplement PG for activation, depending on type, amount, and valency. Especially efficient were the glycolytic intermediates fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ATP, active at cellular concentrations on the DGlcDAG but not on the preceding MGlcDAG synthase. Potencies of different phosphatidylinositol (foreign lipid) derivatives differed with numbers and positions of their phosphate moieties. A selective stimulation of the DGlcDAG, but not the MGlcDAG synthase, by minor amounts of double-stranded DNA was additive to the best phospholipid activators. These results support two types of activator sites on the enzyme: (i) lipid-phosphate ones close to the membrane interphase, and (ii) soluble (or particulate)-phosphate ones further out from the surface. Thereby, the nonbilayer (MGlcDAG) to bilayer (DGlcDAG) lipid balance may be integrated with the metabolic status of the cell and potentially also to membrane and cell division."

Individual Rab proteins are specifically associated with membraneous compartments and contribute to the selectivity of vesicle targeting (for review see Refs. 1.Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin.

Recent evidence from both yeast and mammalian cells suggests that Rab proteins are required for the initial contact formation of vesicles destined to fuse (5.Mayer A. Wickner W. J.

Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Although Rab proteins appear not to be part of the fusion reaction itself, they may be involved in the control of soluble NSF attachment protein receptor proteins, which mediate fusion. (8.Lian J.P.

Sets of specific proteins interact with GTP- and GDP-Rab proteins, either shepherding them to the next step of the cycle or executing a particular task in membrane traffic. The GTP forms of Rabs are considered to represent the active conformations. GTP-Rab proteins bind to effector proteins. A number of such effector proteins has been identified that structurally belong to diverse protein families, and individual Rab proteins may interact with multiple effectors (for review see Refs. 1.Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar and 10.Geppert M. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 75-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition, proteins are known that activate the GTPase of specific Rabs (GTPase-activating proteins), that inhibit the dissociation of GDP (GDP dissociation inhibitor, GDI),1 and that mediate nucleotide exchange (guanine nucleotide exchange factors). Most Rab proteins contain two hydrophobic geranylgeranyl moieties at their C terminus that are responsible for membrane anchoring. Despite these highly hydrophobic side chains, Rab proteins undergo reversible membrane dissociation-association cycles during membrane traffic that are correlated to their GTP/GDP cycles. After GTP hydrolysis, membrane-bound GDP-Rabs are recognized by GDP dissociation inhibitor (Rab·GDI) (11.Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Araki S. Hata Y. Isomura M. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2333-2337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rab·GDI forms a complex with GDP-Rabs that shields their geranylgeranyl moieties and leads to their dissociation from the membrane. GDI·Rab complexes serve then as the precursor form, which mediates the re-binding of Rab proteins to their appropriate membrane (1.Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 2.Schimmoller F. Simon I. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol.

Trends Biochem. 1997; 22: 468-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition to Rab·GDI, calmodulin has recently been suggested to remove Rab3A from membranes in a calcium-dependent manner, but the significance of this finding remains to be established (12.Park J.B. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 20857-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast to proteins mediating other parts of the Rab cycle, the protein factors associated with the GDI-mediated binding of Rab proteins to membranes are not well understood. Since the various GDI isoforms appear to interact indiscriminately with all Rab proteins, membrane binding must be the discerning step that is responsible for the specificity of membrane binding. Consequently, the binding mechanism must be able to recognize the specific type of Rab protein. In yeast, a novel Golgi-associated membrane protein, termed Yip1p, has recently been identified that appears to mediate the binding of the Rab protein Ypt31p (13.Yang X.P. Matern H.T. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4954-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Less is known about the binding sites of mammalian Rabs. Membrane specificity has been demonstrated for in vitro binding of several Rab proteins including Rab4 and Rab5 (14.Ullrich O.H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar,15.Ayad N. Hull M. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4497-4507Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which are localized to early endosomes, and Rab 7 and Rab9 (16.Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Svejstrup A.B.D. Pfeffer S.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25541-25548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which are localized to late endosomes. These studies revealed that binding of Rab proteins involves three distinct steps. First, the GDI·Rab complex binds to the membrane. Second, GDI dissociates after a delay of several minutes. Recently, evidence for a protein factor has been obtained that may be responsible for GDI-dissociation and that appears to be specific for endosomal GDI·Rab complexes (18.Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Sumizawa T. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Third, GTP is exchanged for GDP with the aid of guanine nucleotide exchange factor proteins. The present study was undertaken in order to investigate the membrane-association of Rab3A. Rab3A is the predominant Rab protein in the brain, which is exclusively localized to the membrane of synaptic vesicles (19.Fischer von Mollard G. Mignery G.A. Baumert M. Burger P.M. Perin M. Jahn R.

Before exocytosis, vesicle-bound Rab3A is in the GTP form (29.Stahl B. Fischer von Mollard G. Walch-Solimena C. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24770-24776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of neurotransmitter release leads to GTP hydrolysis (29.Stahl B. Fischer von Mollard G. Walch-Solimena C. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24770-24776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and causes a dissociation of Rab3A from the vesicle membrane that is reversed during recovery from the stimulus (30.Fischer von Mollard G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Nature. 1991; 349: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the re-binding of Rab3A to synaptic vesicles can be reconstituted in vitro. Binding involves the presence of a specific protein receptor that discriminates between Rab3A and Rab1B, which was used for control. Furthermore, we found that both Rab3A binding and dissociation of GDI occur independently of guanine nucleotide exchange and that newly bound Rab3A can be re-extracted with GDI as long as no nucleotide exchange occurs. GDI purified from bovine brain was used as antigen for generating monoclonal antibodies in mice using standard procedures (31.Köhler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12802) Google Scholar, 32.Jahn R. Schiebler W. Ouimet C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A rabbit serum specific for Rab1B was raised using purified Rab1B (see below) as antigen, employing standard procedures of the Yale Animal Care Facility. The serum reacted with only a single band in immunoblots of rat brain cytosol and did not cross-react with either Rab3A or Rab5A (data not shown). The following monoclonal antibodies were described previously and are now commercially available (Synaptic Systems): Rab3A (Cl 42.2; Ref. 33.Matteoli M. Takei K. Cameron R. Hurlbut P. Johnston P.A.

GDI was purified from bovine brain using ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and Mono-Q, respectively. All steps were carried out as described in Ref. 11.Sasaki T.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2333-2337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, except that GDI was eluted from the Mono-Q column by prolonged wash instead of a salt gradient. Rab3A and Rab1B were expressed using the baculovirus system, largely following the procedure described by others for Rab1 and Rab5 (36.Nuoffer C. Peter F. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 37.Horiuchi H. Ullrich O. Bucci C. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). cDNAs for Rab3A and Rab1B were provided by Dr. P. De Camilli (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT), and for Rab5A by Dr. T. C. Südhof. Full-length cDNAs encoding Rab3A, Rab5A, and Rab1B were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the PET11d-Rab3A, PGEX-2T-Rab5A, and PALTER-Ex1-Rab1B constructs, respectively, using appropriate 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotide primers according to standard procedures. Unless indicated otherwise, the 5′ primers were designed to add a myc epitope upstream of the respective 5′ ends. The products were cloned into the BamHI site of the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac His2 A, which contains an N-terminal His6 tag. Constructs containing a single insert in the appropriate orientation were selected by restriction analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Construction and purification of recombinant viruses was performed using the MaxBac baculovirus system (Invitrogen) according the manufacturer's instructions. Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C to a density of ∼2 × 106 cells/ml in spinner flasks and infected with recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection (virions/cell) of 5, and incubation was continued for 72 h. The cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mmMgCl2). Usually, the cells were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C at this stage. To purify prenylated Rab proteins from Sf9 cells, a crude membrane fraction was prepared. The cell suspension was supplemented with 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin, sonicated on ice four times each for 30 s with 30-s intervals at 50% intensity, and centrifuged for 5 min at 900 × g to remove cell debris and nuclei. Membranes were then isolated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and washed once in the same buffer and once in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with protease inhibitors as above. The pellet was then extracted in extraction buffer containing 1% (v/v) CHAPS and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to remove non-soluble components. The following steps involve formation of proteoliposomes, collection of these liposomes by centrifugation, and subsequent re-extraction of these liposomes by detergent. This procedure was shown previously to greatly enrich membrane proteins with almost complete recovery, while efficiently removing proteins without a membrane anchor such as non-prenylated Rab proteins (38.Brose N. Thomas A. Weber M.G. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10604-10610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To the resulting supernatant, 100 mg/ml Biobeads SM2 were added in order to lower the detergent concentration. Following incubation on ice for a few minutes, the turbid extract was removed from the beads and applied to 10 volumes of a Sephadex G50 (fine) column for complete detergent removal. The turbid fractions containing proteoliposomes were collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was re-extracted in lysis buffer containing 1% CHAPS. The extract was then used for purification on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to standard procedures. The final products contained no significant contaminations (as judged by SDS-PAGE); they were stored at −30 °C in 50% glycerol until further use. For the formation of Rab·GDI complexes, equimolar amounts of Rab protein and GDI (2 μm each) were mixed in the presence of 100 μm GDP and 8 mm MgCl2, followed by extensive dialysis against a buffer containing 64 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm GDP, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin. The mixture was clarified by ultracentrifugation in a TLA 100.2 rotor at 95,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as Rab·GDI complex. The complexes were kept on ice and normally used within 72 h. As acceptor membranes in standard binding assays, a fraction enriched in synaptic vesicles (LP2 fraction) was prepared by first isolating synaptosomes from rat brain, followed by hypotonic shock and differential centrifugation (39.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). When indicated, synaptic vesicles were further purified from LP2 using, consecutively, sucrose density gradient centrifugation and chromatography on controlled pore glass beads (CPG) (39.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 40.Hell J.W. Jahn R. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, New York1994: 567-574Google Scholar). The eluate from the controlled pore glass bead column was divided in three fractions, one enriched in large membranes (CPG I), one intermediate fraction (CPG II), and one highly enriched in synaptic vesicles (CPG III; see Ref. 41.Walch-Solimena C. Blasi J. Edelmann L. Chapman E.R. Fischer von Mollard G. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar for further details). Membranes enriched in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were obtained by consecutive differential and density gradient centrifugation using Percoll and Nycodenz gradients (42.Schweizer A. Matter K. Ketcham C.M. Hauri H.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). LP2 from Rab3A-deficient mice was prepared as above. The mice (21.Geppert M. Bolshakov V.Y. Siegelbaum S.A. Takei K. De Camilli P. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. T. C. Südhof. Binding or Rab proteins to membranes was measured as follows unless indicated otherwise. The reaction mixture contained 10 μg of membrane protein, 100 ng (4.5 nm) of Rab·GDI complex, binding assay buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 115 mmKCl, 1.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin), 100 μm guanine nucleotide as indicated, and an ATP regeneration system (1.4 mmMgCl2, 0.4 mm ATP, 6 mmphosphocreatine, 8 units of creatine phosphokinase), which, however, was omitted in later experiments. The final assay volume was 250 μl. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C the reaction was stopped by addition of 500 μl of ice-cold assay buffer. Membranes were sedimented by centrifugation in a TLA 100.2 rotor at 95,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed once with 500 μl of assay buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. In all experiments, the supernatants were also analyzed in order to check whether unbound Rab·GDI complex and/or released GDI were recovered in the supernatants at the end of the binding reaction. This was the case in all experiments described here. Under standard conditions, about 40–50% of Rab3A remained in the supernatant with an overall recovery (supernatant + pellet) of about 80%. Furthermore, parallel incubations were carried out for each data point in which the membranes were omitted, in order to rule out that Rab recovery in the pellet fraction is due to aggregation. Each binding experiment shown here was repeated independently at least three times, yielding very similar results. Guanine nucleotide exchange was monitored by the binding of radiolabeled GTPγS. In order to reduce background binding of GTPγS to endogenous Rab proteins, the membranes (200 μg of protein) were pre-incubated with 1 μm GDI in the presence of 100 μm GDP using conditions identical to those in Rab binding experiments. Incubations for nucleotide exchange were carried out exactly as for Rab binding, except that 5 nm [35S]GTPγS (about 0.7 μCi/reaction) were present. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 900 μl of ice-cold assay buffer. Protein-bound radioactivity was recovered by filtration through a Millipore HA type filter (0.45-μm pore size) and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (43.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membranes was performed according to Ref. 44.Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar using alkaline phosphatase enzymatic reaction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 125I Protein A radiography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) detection. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (45.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) or with the BCA method (Pierce). Protease treatment of membranes was carried out at a concentration of 8 mg/ml membrane protein and 1 mg/ml trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), bromelain (Sigma), and elastase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), respectively, for 1 h at 37 °C. The incubations were stopped by 10-fold dilution with ice-cold incubation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and the addition of 2 mg/ml appropriate protease inhibitors (trypsin inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), bromelain inhibitor (Sigma), and elastatinal (Sigma)), respectively. Protease-treated membranes were then isolated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and tested for Rab binding activity using standard assay conditions. GDI was purified from bovine brain (11.Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Araki S. Hata Y. Isomura M. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2333-2337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the characterization of GDI and Rab·GDI complexes, we generated a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for GDI. Clone Cl 81.2 showed the strongest reaction and was therefore used in all subsequent experiments. When rat brain cytosol was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, a single band of an approximate M r = 55,000 was detected by this antibody which comigrated with purified GDI (Fig.1 A). We then examined whether the antibody was able to immunoprecipitate Rab·GDI complexes from cytosol. As shown in Fig. 1 B, both GDI and Rab3A were detectable in the immunoprecipitate. In contrast, the α-subunit of the trimeric GTPase GO2 that is abundantly expressed on synaptic vesicles (46.Ahnert-Hilger G. Schafer T. Spicher K. Grund C. Schultz G. Wiedenmann B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 65: 26-38Google Scholar) did not co-precipitate, showing the specificity of the immunoprecipitation procedure. Posttranslationally modified Rab3A and Rab1B were produced in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system. All proteins contained an N-terminally attached His6 tag for affinity purification. Furthermore, a myc epitope was added downstream of the His6 tag in order to differentiate the recombinant Rab proteins from their endogenous counterparts. For Rab3A, a version lacking the myc epitope was also prepared. When the proteins were extracted and purified according to Ref. 36.Nuoffer C. Peter F. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, the resulting protein fractions were of low yield and purity, particularly for Rab3A and myc-Rab3A. Therefore, an additional purification step was included. It involves the reconstitution of all membrane proteins into proteoliposomes, separation of these proteoliposomes from non-incorporated proteins, and re-solubilization of the liposomes by detergent prior to affinity chromatography. Yield and purity were significantly improved (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Rab3A purified by this procedure bound stoichiometric amounts of GTP (data not shown), demonstrating that its nucleotide binding pocket is correctly folded. Rab·GDI complexes were formed by dialysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). To examine whether GDI and Rab proteins were indeed bound to each other after dialysis, GDI was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody Cl 81.2 and then probed for the presence of the respective Rab protein. As shown in Fig. 1 C, virtually all of Rab3A coprecipitated with GDI, indicating that no free Rab3A was present in the complex fraction. Similar results were obtained for the other Rab·GDI complexes. In the first series of experiments, an assay for binding of Rab3A to synaptic vesicles was established. A membrane fraction enriched about 5–8-fold in synaptic vesicles (LP2, see Refs. 32.Jahn R. Schiebler W. Ouimet C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4137-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar and 39.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) was prepared from rat brain and used as acceptor in all experiments unless indicated otherwise. After incubation of the membranes with Rab3A·GDI complexes, bound Rab3A was separated from unbound Rab3A by ultracentrifugation and binding was measured by immunoblotting. LP2 contains endogenously bound Rab3A that needed to be differentiated from the exogenously added variant. Therefore, the myc-tagged form of Rab3A was used in most experiments, which is well separated from endogenous Rab3A on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Unless indicated otherwise, both endogenous and exogenous Rab3A were detected with a Rab3A-specific monoclonal antibody to allow for direct comparison. In order to control for membrane recovery, synaptobrevin, an integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles, was monitored in parallel. First, we defined the time dependence of the binding reaction. The myc-Rab3A·GDI complex was incubated with synaptic vesicles under standard conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) for different time periods. Rab3 binding increased from 0 to 30 min but did not increase further during prolonged incubation (Fig.2 A). The amount of endogenous Rab3A on synaptic vesicles did not change during the incubation. In addition, no accumulation of GDI on the membrane was observed at any time. Binding was dependent on the amount of vesicles in an approximately linear manner between 5 and 50 μg of vesicle protein (data not shown), and 10 μg were used in all subsequent experiments. Under standard conditions (10 μg of vesicle protein, 30 min of incubation), about 35% of the Rab3A added to the assay (as Rab·GDI complex) was recovered in the membrane pellet, with approximately 40% remaining unbound (Fig. 2 B). The loss of about 20–25% is probably due to adsorption. Next, we investigated whether the Rab3 pool found in the membrane pellet after the binding reaction is indeed attached to vesicles instead of representing aggregated proteins cosedimenting with the membranes. For this purpose, we used a flotation gradient in order to separate the mem"

Hyperten. 1996; 5: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Active transport of organic solutes in biological systems is primarily linked to a transmembrane ion gradient. The electrochemical proton gradient in microbes is the primary driving force for the transport of amino acids, sugars, and small peptides. In contrast, in animal kingdom the predominant coupling ion for the active transport of the organic solutes seems to be Na+ rather than H+. The electrochemical Na+ gradient provides the driving force for active transport of most nutrients. However, in the peptide transport process it appears that this ancient driving mechanism has not been shifted during the evolution (2.Ganapathy V. Brandsch M. Leibach F.H. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1994: 1773-1794Google Scholar). It is this transmembrane H+ gradient that energizes the active transfer of oligopeptides. In the past several years, two different peptide transporters actively translocating di- and tripeptides, namely PEPT1 and PEPT2, have been cloned and characterized from the mammalian intestine and kidney, respectively (4.Fei Y.J.

The major difference between these two transporters, in terms of transport function, is in the affinity toward their common substrates, the former being a low affinity type and the latter a high affinity type. Previously, two oligopeptide transporters (OPT)1 fromCaenorhabditis elegans, namely OPT1 and OPT2, homologous to the mammalian counterparts, PEPT1 and PEPT2, respectively, were identified, isolated, and characterized in our lab (12.Fei Y.J. Fujita T. Lapp D.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a data base search revealed that there might be another OPT isoform encoded by the gene F56F4.5 on chromosome I in C. elegans. Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of this OPT isoform designated OPT3. OPT3 is capable of mediating the H+-coupled transport of peptides when expressed heterologously in mammalian cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes. Interestingly, this isoform also functions as a H+ channel, and the H+gradient-dependent H+ channel activity is much more predominant than the H+-coupled peptide transport activity. OPT3 is expressed exclusively in neurons. These studies suggest that OPT3 might play an important role in H+homeostasis in C. elegans in addition to its likely role in the clearance of peptides arising from neuropeptide metabolism. In mammals, PEPT2 is expressed in the brain, and a similar role for this transporter in the clearance of peptide products arising from the hydrolysis of neuropeptides within the brain has been postulated (13.Wang H.

A wild type nematode strain, C. elegans N2 (Bristol) was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (St. Paul, MN). Nematode culture was carried out using a standard procedure with a large scale liquid cultivation protocol (17.Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. Methods in Cell Biology. 48. Academic Press, New York1995: 4-27Google Scholar). To remove the main contaminants, the nematodes were cleaned by a sedimentation method through 15% (w/v) Ficoll 400 in 0.1 mNaCl. The pellet was used for total RNA preparation. Total RNA was isolated from the C. elegans using TRIzol reagent from Life Technologies, Inc. Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified by a double affinity chromatography using oligo(dT)-cellulose (12.Fei Y.J. Fujita T. Lapp D.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A pair of the PCR primers specific for the putative C. elegans opt3 gene was designed: 5′-CCA GCG GTA TTT TTT ATG C-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CAC CTC CAA CCA TTT TCC-3′ (reverse primer). Poly(A)+RNA (∼0.5 μg) isolated from mixed stage C. elegans worms was taken as template to perform RT-PCR using an RT-PCR kit from Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, CT). A single DNA fragment was obtained by RT-PCR with an estimated size of ∼0.7 kb as predicted by the distance between these two primers. Following PCR, the amplified DNA fragment was gel purified and cloned into a pGEM T Easy-vector (Promega Madison, WI), and its identity was established by sequencing. The fragment was used as a probe to screen a C. elegans cDNA library. SuperScript Plasmid System from Life Technologies, Inc. was used to establish the cDNA library using the poly(A)+ RNA from C. elegans. The transformation of the ligated cDNA into E. coli was performed by electroporation using ElectroMAX DH10B competent cells. The bacteria plating, the filter lifting, the DNA fragment labeling, and the hybridization methods followed the routine procedure (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 8.3-8.82Google Scholar). The DNA sequencing of the full-length OPT3 clone was performed using an automatic PCR thermocycler procedure. OPT3 was expressed heterologously inX. laevis oocytes by microinjection of OPT3 cRNA. The procedures for in vitro transcription, oocyte isolation, and microinjection have been described previously (4.Fei Y.J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.K.

The function of OPT3 in oocytes was monitored by the uptake of the radiolabeled dipeptide [14C]glycylsarcosine and by the inward currents measured by the two-microelectrode voltage clamp method. Ion-selective microelectrodes were used to monitor intracellular pH (pHi) of oocytes as described previously (4.Fei Y.J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.K.

Intracellular ion activity was measured as the difference between the ion-selective electrode (pH) and a KCl voltage electrode impaled into the oocyte, and membrane potential (Vm) was the potential difference between the KCl microelectrode and an extracellular calomel (20.Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F425-F432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Briefly, ion-selective microelectrodes were fabricated using borosilicate fiber capillary glass silanized at 210 °C withbis-(dimethylamino)-dimethylsilane and shanks coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning, Midland, MI). Micropipettes were cooled under vacuum, and the tips were filled with H+ ionophore I-mixture B ion-selective resin (Fluka, Ronkonkoma, NY). H+electrodes were backfilled with 40 mmKH2PO4, 23 mm NaOH, 15 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The pH electrodes were calibrated using standard buffers of pH 6.0 and 8.0 (Fisher) followed by point calibration in uptake solution (pH 7.5). The pH electrodes had slopes of at least −56 mV/pH unit. An oocyte was put into a ∼300-μl perfusion chamber and perfused at 5–8 ml/min during pHi and Vm recordings. The vaccinia virus expression technique was used to functionally express OPT3 cDNA in mammalian cells as described previously (6.Liang R. Fei Y.J. Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Han H. Yang-Feng T.L.

HeLa cells or HRPE cells grown in 24-well (3 × 105 cells/well) plates were infected with the recombinant virus VTF7–3 at a multiplicity of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. The virus was allowed to adsorb for 30 min in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C with gentle shaking of the plate. Cells were then transfected with the plasmid DNA (empty vector pSPORT or OPT3 cDNA construct) using the lipofection procedure previously described (6.Liang R. Fei Y.J. Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S.

The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h and used for determination of transport activity. Control transfections consisted of equivalent amounts of empty vector. [14C]Gly-Sar uptake was determined at room temperature for 5 min as described previously (13.Wang H. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C967-C975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pH of the extracellular medium was varied between 6.0 and 8.0 by adjusting the concentrations of Mes, Hepes, and Tris appropriately. To study the tissue-specific expression patterns of the opt3 gene in C. elegans, a transcriptional opt3::gfp fusion gene was constructed, and DNA transformation was carried out. The expression pattern of the opt3 gene was investigated in living animals of the transformed lines. A pair of primers for construction of a transcriptional opt3::gfp fusion gene was designed. The forward primer (5′-GCG ATC GAT AAA AAT AAC AGA ATT AGT AAG AAG GTG GG-3′) corresponds to the nucleotide positions 31,979–32,011 of the cosmid T27A3 (accession number U88180). The primer contains an incorporated ClaI restriction site. The reverse primer, 5′-CGC CCG GGA GAG GCG GAA TTA ATT TTA TAG TT-3′, corresponds to the nucleotide positions 34,416–34,445 in the same cosmid. A SmaI site was incorporated in this primer for the convenience of subsequent cloning. A ∼2.5-kb DNA fragment of theop3 gene was amplified using the cosmid T27A3 DNA as template and using the oligonucleotides as primers in PCR. The amplified region contains the putative promoter for the opt3gene. The PCR product was subjected to a Clal I andSmaI double digestion and inserted into a GFP expression vector pPD117.01 (a generous gift from Dr. A. Fire, Carnegie Institution, Baltimore, MD) prepared in the same way. In this minigene construct, a built-in mec7 promoter region (∼0.9 kb) was replaced by the opt3 promoter fragment in such a way that the GFP transcription is under control of the putative promoter of theopt3 gene. Transgenic lines were established using a standard germ line transformation protocol (22.Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). A cloned mutant collagen gene containing the rol-6 (plasmid pRF4, kindly provided by Dr. M. Koelle, Yale University School of Medicine. New Haven, CT) was used as a dominant genetic marker for DNA transformation. Co-injection of this dominant marker with the GFP fusion constructs allowed progeny selection of the transformed animals by their “roller” phenotype. The F1 rollers were picked up according to their characteristic rolling behavior and cultured individually to establish transformed lines. F2 rollers with extrachromosome arrays were selected for fluorescence microscopy to determine the GFP expression pattern. Stable transgenic lines were established by the γ-irradiation method from the F2 rollers, and the background was cleaned up by several times of outcross (23.Anderson P. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 31-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cell identification was validated by their morphology in combination with relative positions of the GFP-positive cells in the same animals using differential interference contrast image. A ∼0.7-kb DNA fragment was obtained by RT-PCR using a pair of primers designed based on the cosmid F56F4 sequence. The DNA sequence of the product matched that of OPT3 (from Pro15 to Ala242) at the protein level as suggested by the GenFinder from the genome (24.Hodgkin J. Plasterk R.H. Waterston R.H. Science. 1995; 270: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25.Chalfie M. Eddy S. Hengartner M.O. Hodgkin J. Kohara Y. Plasterk R.H. Waterston R.H. White J.G. Science. 1995; 270: 415-430PubMed Google Scholar). The partial PCR-cloned DNA fragment was used as a hybridization probe to screen a C. elegans (mixed stages) cDNA library to obtain the full-length cDNA clone. The OPT3 cDNA sequence is approximately ∼2.5 kilobase pairs long with a poly(A) tail. The 5′-untranslated and the 3′-untranslated regions are 66 and 316 base pairs long, respectively. The polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA is located at 21 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tail in the cloned cDNA. The cDNA sequence of C. elegans OPT3 has been deposited in GenBankTM with accession number AF142441. The OPT3 transporter protein deduced from the cDNA sequence contains 701 amino acid residues (Fig.1 A) and has a molecular mass of ∼78.0 kDa, with an isoelectric point 7.45. According to the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot, this protein possesses multiple transmembrane domains (transmembrane domain 11, with a window size of 21 amino acids). The large extracellular loop is predicted to be located between transmembrane domains 8 and 9. The opt3 gene from C. elegans is localized on chromosome I and contains, at least, ∼4.4-kb nucleotides. The distance between the opt3 gene and the upstream gene,T27A3.1, is estimated to be ∼7.0 kb long, where the potential regulatory region of the opt3 gene is located (C. elegans data base, ACeDB, version 4.3, data version WS2.4–17). The presence of 13 exons in the opt3 gene is deduced by a comparison between the sequences of the cloned cDNA and the opt3 gene (GenBankTM deposit F56F4.5). The exon-intron organization of the gene is shown in Fig.1 B. There is no identifiable transplicing leader sequence in the OPT3 cDNA. This indicates that the mRNA is directly transcribed from the opt3 gene, similar to the first two oligopeptide transporters (OPT1 and OPT2) previously reported (12.Fei Y.J. Fujita T. Lapp D.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). OPT3, when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes or in mammalian cells, demonstrated transport activity toward peptide substrates. Transport activity of OPT3 exhibited prominent H+dependence in both expression systems (Fig.2). At pH 5.5, [14C]Gly-Sar uptake in OPT3 cRNA-injected oocytes was 43-fold higher in comparison with the uptake in water-injected oocytes (108.1 ± 6.8versus 2.5 ± 0.3 pmol/oocyte/h). At pH 7.5, the uptake activity of OPT3 decreased significantly and showed only a 25-fold stimulation above the uptake activity in water-injected oocytes (57.7 ± 2.0 versus 2.3 ± 0.5 pmol/oocyte/h). Substitution of Na+ and Cl− with choline and gluconate, respectively, in the uptake medium showed no significant effects on OPT3 uptake activity in the Xenopus oocyte system (data not shown). The functional expression of OPT3 cDNA was also performed in a mammalian expression system. Transient expression of OPT3 in both HeLa cells and HRPE cells was monitored by the transport of [14C]Gly-Sar. When studied in the pH range of 5.5 to 8.0, Gly-Sar influx in control cells transfected with vector alone was negligible, indicating that neither HeLa cells nor HRPE cells themselves have significant levels of peptide transport activity. In contrast, Gly-Sar influx in OPT3 cDNA-transfected cells was much higher than in control cells. Furthermore, the cDNA-dependent influx showed a marked dependence on pH. The influx increased severalfold when the pH was changed from 8.0 to 5.5. The pH dependence was seen in HeLa cells as well as HRPE cells. These data show clearly that OPT3 is a H+-coupled peptide transporter driven by a transmembrane H+ gradient. The H+-coupled Gly-Sar transportvia OPT3 was then studied using electrophysiological approaches in Xenopus oocytes expressing this transporter heterologously. The transporter-associated current measurements were made using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp protocol. These studies have revealed an interesting phenomenon associated with OPT3. In the absence of the peptide substrate, changing the pH of the perfusion buffer from 7.5 to 5.0 induced large inward currents in OPT3-expressing oocytes (Fig. 3). The magnitude of this pH-dependent inward current varied between 350–1,000 nA in different oocytes. This characteristic is unique to OPT3. When the pH of the perfusion buffer is changed from 7.5 to 5.0, the magnitude of inward currents seen in oocytes expressing C. elegans OPT1 or OPT2 was typically 15–25 nA (data not shown). The same is true in water-injected oocytes (the last current curve on the rightin Fig. 3) or in oocytes expressing mammalian PEPT1 or PEPT2. Addition of Gly-Sar to the perfusion buffer at pH 5.0 caused a further increase in the magnitude of the inward current in OPT3-expressing cells. But the peptide-induced current was only about 20–25% of the H+-induced current. These studies also showed that the H+-induced current as well as the peptide-induced current was dependent on the concentration of H+ in the perfusion buffer. The magnitude of these currents decreased as the H+concentration decreased in the buffer, as evidenced from the changes in currents associated with the changes in pH from 5.0 to 6.5. The H+-induced currents and the peptide-induced currents of OPT3 were further analyzed in terms of their dependence on membrane potential. Steady-state currents in OPT3-expressing oocytes measured at three different conditions are shown in Fig.4, namely pH 7.5 (A), pH 5.0 (B), and pH 5.0 plus 2 mm Gly-Sar (C). These steady-state currents, plotted as a function of membrane potential, are shown in Fig. 4 D. These values were used to analyze the current-membrane potential relationship independently for the H+-induced current (Fig.4 E) and peptide-induced current (Fig. 4 F). The magnitude of both currents increased markedly with the hyperpolarization of membrane potential. The H+-induced current was about 300 nA at a membrane potential of −50 mV, and this value increased to about 1,000 nA when the membrane potential was hyperpolarized to −150 mV. The corresponding values for peptide-induced current were 110 and 940 nA. At lower membrane potential, the H+-induced current was more predominant than the peptide-induced current. The difference between these two components appeared to become smaller when the membrane potential was hyperpolarized. We analyzed the kinetic characteristics of OPT3-mediated H+-dependent currents (Fig.5). H+-induced currents were measured at increasing concentrations of H+ in the perfusion buffer and at different testing membrane potentials. All these measurements were made in the absence of peptide substrates. Fig.5 A describes the current-membrane potential relationships at different H+ concentrations in the range of 30 nm to 10 μm. Fig. 5 B shows that the H+-induced current is saturable with respect to H+ concentration in this range. The relationship between H+ concentration and the magnitude of the current induced was hyperbolic at all testing membrane potentials. Fig. 5 (Cand D) describes the influence of membrane potential on the kinetic parameters of the H+-induced current. TheI max H was found to increase when the membrane potential was hyperpolarized. TheK 0.5 H value for H+ (i.e. H+ concentration at half-maximal current) increased as the membrane potential was depolarized. At a membrane potential of −50 mV, theK 0.5 H for H+ was 1.0 ± 0.2 μm. Hyperpolarization of the membrane potential decreased theK 0.5 H value for H+ to a significant extent. TheK 0.5 H value for H+ was 0.3 ± 0.1 μm at a membrane potential of −150 mV. The kinetics of peptide-induced currents was analyzed for two peptide substrates, Gly-Sar and carnosine. The peptide-induced currents were also saturable with respect to peptide concentration. The relationship was hyperbolic for Gly-Sar as well as carnosine (data not shown). The kinetic parameters I maxPep andK 0.5Pep were calculated, and the influence of membrane potential on these parameters is described in Fig. 6. TheI maxPep increased in magnitude as the membrane potential was hyperpolarized (Fig.6 A). The K 0.5 value for Gly-Sar decreased significantly when the membrane potential was hyperpolarized. The K 0.5 for Gly-Sar was 0.74 ± 0.11 mm at −50 mV, and this value decreased to 0.36 ± 0.06 mm at −150 mV (Fig. 6 B). The influence of membrane potential on K 0.5 for carnosine was similar except that when the membrane potential was depolarized beyond −30 mV, the K 0.5 for carnosine decreased. Under similar conditions, the K 0.5 for Gly-Sar increased. OPT3-mediated H+-influx was demonstrated by an intracellular pH (pHi) measurement protocol using a pH-sensitive microelectrode impaled into oocytes to continuously record pHi changes, along with another microelectrode to monitor variations of the membrane potential (Vm) simultaneously. The results obtained with an OPT3-expressing oocyte are described in Fig. 7 A. A switch of pH of the perfusion buffer from 7.5 to 5.5 without any dipeptide substrate caused a marked decrease in pHi (from pHi ∼7.35 to ∼7.15) accompanied by a marked depolarization of the membrane (from −58 mV to +2 mV). The addition of a dipeptide substrate (Gly-Leu) to the perfusion buffer did not alter the intracellular acidification and caused a slight additional depolarization of the membrane. Removal of the dipeptide substrate from the perfusion buffer reversed the membrane depolarization. A switch of pH of the perfusion buffer from 5.5 to 7.5 resulted in a significant recovery of intracellular pH and a complete reversal of the membrane potential to the original value (∼ -58 mV). For comparison, a similar experiment was carried out with an OPT2-expressing oocyte (Fig.7 B). A switch of pH of the perfusion buffer from 7.5 to 5.5 without Gly-Leu caused an intracellular acidification and a depolarization. The addition of Gly-Leu to the perfusion buffer resulted in marked intracellular acidification, i.e.decreased pHi, accompanied by a significant change in membrane potential (from −5 mV to +55 mV). Removal of the dipeptide substrate stopped the intracellular acidification and reversed the depolarization markedly. A switch of pH of the perfusion buffer from 5.5 to 7.5 returned the membrane potential to the original value. However, there was only a partial recovery of pHi. Three significant differences can be noted between the oocytes expressing OPT3 and OPT2. First, a switch of pHofrom 7.5 to 5.5 alone caused a rapid and marked acidification in the OPT3-expressing oocyte (0.25 pH units in <5 min) but a slower and smaller acidification in OPT2-expressing oocyte (0.1 pH units in 10 min). These data show that OPT3 exhibits a much higher level of peptide-uncoupled H+ conductance than OPT2. Second, the addition of a dipeptide substrate did not alter the H+conductance pathway of OPT3, i.e., no further pHi decrease. In contrast, the dipeptide substrate caused intracellular acidification in the OPT2-expressing oocytes, showing that OPT2 mediates a high level of peptide/H+ co-transport. H+ influx viathis co-transport pathway was much higher than the H+influx via H+ conductance pathway in the OPT2-expressing oocyte. Third, the recovery of pHi when pHo was changed from 5.5 to 7.5 was markedly different between the oocytes expressing OPT3 and OPT2. In the OPT3-expressing oocyte, the recovery was marked, indicating that OPT3-mediated H+ efflux was facilitated by"
https://openalex.org/W1987966214,"Interaction between the C terminus of a G-protein-coupled receptor and intracellular constituents may represent a crucial step in regulating signal transduction. To identify potential interacting candidates the C terminus of the somatostatin receptor subtype 1 was used as bait in a yeast two hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library. We identified the human Skb1 sequence (Skb1Hs) as interacting protein, which is homologous to the yeast protein known Skb1 to down-regulate mitosis in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>via binding to the Shk1 protein kinase; the latter is a homolog to the mammalian p21<sup>cdc42/Rac</sup>-activated protein kinases. Interaction required almost the entire C terminus of the somatostatin receptor subtype 1 including the conserved NP<i>XX</i>Y motif of transmembrane region seven; in the case of the Skb1Hs most of the N terminus and an <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine binding domain were mandatory, whereas the C terminus was not essential. Interaction was verified by coexpression experiments in human embryonic kidney cells. As revealed by immunocytochemical analysis Skb1Hs expressed alone aggregates in large cytosolic clusters. When coexpressed, receptor subtype 1 and Skb1Hs were colocalized at the cell surface; these cells showed a strong increase in somatostatin binding compared with cells expressing the receptor only. This may suggest that Skb1Hs acts like a chaperone by correctly targeting the receptor to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2032822609,"Previously, we cloned a variant form of the type 1 fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1), FGFR-VT−, from Xenopus embryos (Gillespie, L. L., Chen, G., and Paterno, G. D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 22758–22763). This isoform differed from the reported FGFR1 sequence (FGFR-VT+) by a 2-amino acid deletion, Val423-Thr424, in the juxtamembrane region. This deletion arises from the use of an alternate 5′ splice donor site, and the activity of the VT+ and VT− forms of the FGFR1 was regulated by phosphorylation at this site. We have now investigated the expression pattern and function of these two isoforms in mesoderm formation in Xenopus embryos. Cells within the marginal zone are induced to form mesoderm during blastula stages. RNase protection analysis of blastula stage embryos revealed that the VT+ isoform was expressed throughout the embryo but that the VT− isoform was expressed almost exclusively in the marginal zone. The ratio of VT+:VT− transcripts in the marginal zone indicated that the VT+ form was predominant throughout blastula stages except for a brief interval, coinciding with the start of zygotic transcription, when a dramatic increase in VT− expression levels was detected. This increase could be mimicked in part by treatment of animal cap explants with FGF-2. Overexpression of the VT+ isoform in Xenopus embryos resulted in development of tadpoles with severe reductions in trunk and tail structures, while embryos overexpressing the VT− isoform developed normally. A standard mesoderm induction assay revealed that a 10-fold higher concentration of FGF-2 was required to reach 50% induction in VT+-overexpressing animal cap explants compared with those overexpressing the VT− isoform. Furthermore, little or no expression of the panmesodermal marker Brachyury (Xbra) was detected in VT+-overexpressing embryos, while VT−-overexpressing embryos showed normal staining. This demonstrates that VT+ overexpression had a negative effect on mesoderm formation in vivo. These data are consistent with a model in which mesoderm formation in vivo is regulated, at least in part, by the relative expression levels of the VT+ and VT− isoforms. Previously, we cloned a variant form of the type 1 fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1), FGFR-VT−, from Xenopus embryos (Gillespie, L. L., Chen, G., and Paterno, G. D. (1995) J. Biol.

Biosci. 1999; 4: 165-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other receptor tyrosine kinases, FGFR signal transduction is initiated by ligand binding and results in activation of several well characterized intracellular signaling pathways, including the protein kinase C (PKC) and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (4.Gillespie L.L.

Four FGFR genes have been described to date, FGFR1–FGFR4, along with a number of alternately spliced variants (reviewed in Refs. 3.Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front.

Previously, we cloned from Xenopus embryos an alternately spliced isoform of the FGFR1 that contains a deletion of Val423-Thr424 in the juxtamembrane region (7.Gillespie L.L. Chen G. Paterno G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22758-22763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that this site could be phosphorylated by PKC. Furthermore, in a functional assay, activation of PKC by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate significantly reduced the activity of the VT-containing isoform (VT+) in Xenopusoocytes while having little effect on the deletion isoform (VT−). We speculated that differential expression of these two isoforms might represent an important mechanism for regulating FGFR activity in theXenopus embryo (7.Gillespie L.L. Chen G. Paterno G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22758-22763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the blastula stage Xenopus embryo, cells located in the equatorial region (marginal zone) are induced to differentiate into mesoderm in response to signal(s) from neighboring vegetal cells (reviewed in Refs. 8.Kimelman D. Christian J.L. Moon R.T. Development. 1992; 116: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 9.Isaacs H.V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Use of a dominant negative form of the FGFR1 to block FGF activity has provided evidence that FGF/FGFR signaling is required for normal development of the mesoderm (10.Amaya E. Musci T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 257-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The current view is that FGF does not act as the initial inducing signal(s) but rather as a competence factor in the responding cells and that its activity is required for the full range of responses leading to mesoderm formation (9.Isaacs H.V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11.Cornell R.A. Musci T.J. Kimelman D. Development. 1995; 121: 2429-2437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we examine the role of the VT+ and VT− isoforms in mesoderm formation in Xenopus and show that the two isoforms are differentially expressed in the presumptive mesoderm and that they differ in their ability to mediate mesoderm formation in vitro and in vivo.

Whole mount in situ hybridization with digoxygenin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)-labeled Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra) orXenopus chordin cRNA was performed as described (20.Yang S. Lockwood A. Hollett P.

The cDNAs for Xenopus Brachyury andchordin were kindly provided by Dr. R. T. Moon (University of Washington). Previously, we demonstrated that the activity of the VT+ and VT− isoforms could be differentially regulated by phosphorylation (7.Gillespie L.L. Chen G. Paterno G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22758-22763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One obvious question is whether these two isoforms function differently in mesoderm formation in Xenopus embryos. Induction to form mesoderm takes place in the marginal zone cells of the blastula stage embryo, so we began by examining the spatial expression pattern of the VT+ and VT− isoforms during this stage of development. Embryos were dissected into three regions representing the three germ layers: animal (presumptive ectoderm), marginal zone (presumptive mesoderm), and vegetal (presumptive endoderm). RNase protection assays of these three regions revealed that the VT− isoform was expressed predominantly in the marginal zone with very little detectable message in the animal and vegetal regions (Fig.1 B). In contrast, only small differences in VT+ expression were observed in the three regions (Fig.1 B). Although we had previously reported that the VT+ isoform was the major form expressed throughout development and that no change in the ratio of VT+ to VT− isoforms was detected (7.Gillespie L.L. Chen G. Paterno G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22758-22763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the time intervals used in that study were large in order to cover a broad range of developmental stages. In light of the results in Fig. 1 B, we decided to reexamine the temporal VT+ and VT− expression patterns in the marginal zone, using shorter time intervals and focusing on the stages when mesoderm induction is known to take place. Blastula stage embryos were collected at 0.5-h time intervals, and the VT+ and VT− expression levels in the marginal zone were analyzed by RT-PCR. For this purpose, we employed primers that bracket the VT region and generate VT+ and VT− products that can be distinguished on a sequencing gel. Our analysis revealed that in early blastulae (4.5 h postfertilization; late stage 7), the VT+ isoform was the major form in marginal zone cells (Fig. 1 C, lane 3), consistent with our previous findings (7.Gillespie L.L. Chen G. Paterno G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22758-22763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, 30 min later (stage 8), a dramatic increase in the level of VT− relative to VT+ was observed, such that the VT− isoform became predominant (Fig. 1 C,lane 4). This was quickly followed by a decrease in VT− expression to initial levels, with the VT+ isoform remaining predominant at all subsequent time points examined (Fig. 1 C,lanes 5 and 6). Our previous work demonstrated that these two FGFR1 isoforms arise by alternate use of a 5′ splice donor site during transcription (7.Gillespie L.L. Chen G. Paterno G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22758-22763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). InXenopus embryos, however, zygotic transcription does not begin until midblastula transition (21.Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). This occurs during stage 8, but the precise timing of this developmental event cannot be determined by either the number of cell divisions or the time after fertilization (Ref. 21.Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 22.Masui Y. Wang P. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Instead, an increase in elongation factor 1-α expression, one of the earliest transcripts to be expressed by the embryonic genome (23.Krieg P.A. Varnum S.M. Wormington W.M. Melton D.A. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), has been frequently used to indicate that zygotic transcription has begun. We measured elongation factor 1-α levels in our marginal zone samples and determined that expression levels began to increase as early as 5 h (Fig.1 C, lane 4). This demonstrates that the increase in VT− expression takes place concurrent with the onset of zygotic transcription. We investigated the possibility that FGF itself was involved in this switch in expression pattern, since Musci et al. (24.Musci T.J. Amaya E. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8365-8369Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and Friesel and Dawid (25.Friesel R. Dawid I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2481-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have reported that FGFR1 mRNA levels in animal cap explants were regulated by FGF. We cultured blastula stage animal cap explants with FGF-2 in a standard mesoderm induction assay (2.Slack J.M.W. Darlington B.G. Heath J.K. Godsave S.F. Nature. 1987; 326: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) and determined VT+ and VT− expression levels at various times after the addition of FGF-2. VT− expression levels in FGF-2-treated explants increased within 0.5 h, compared with untreated control explants (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). At all subsequent time intervals tested, VT− expression levels in FGF-treated explants remained the same as control levels (Fig. 2, lanes 3–8). VT+ expression levels, on the other hand, remained relatively constant throughout. These data demonstrate that a temporary increase in the expression level of the VT− isoform can be triggered by FGF. It is clear, however, that FGF induction alone cannot account for the large increase in VT− levels observed in vivo (compare Fig.1 C, lane 4, with Fig. 2,lane 2). The additional factor(s) responsible for the increase in VT− expression in the marginal zone remain to be determined. The rapid and transient switch to VT− expression in the presumptive mesoderm suggests that these two FGFR1 isoforms have distinct roles in early development. We investigated this possibility by examining the effects of overexpressing each isoform. cRNA was microinjected into fertilized eggs, and FGFR-injected embryos were compared with control H2O-injected embryos for their ability to develop into normal tadpoles. While embryos overexpressing the VT− isoform developed normally (Figs. 3 Aand 4 C), less than 10% of those overexpressing the VT+ isoform developed into normal tadpoles (Figs. 3 A and 4 B). VT+-injected embryos began to develop abnormally at 10–12 h postinjection: gastrulation was incomplete, leaving an enlarged blastopore with protruding yolk plug (not shown). Despite this, embryos continued to develop, albeit abnormally. The obvious effect was a reduction in trunk and tail structures in the resulting tadpoles (Fig. 4 B). This differential effect was not due to differential stability or translation of the cRNAs, since equivalent levels of VT+ and VT− RNA (Fig. 3 B) and protein (Fig. 3 C) were detectable at 24 h, long past the stage when abnormalities first became apparent in the VT+-overexpressing embryos.Figure 4FGFR-VT+ overexpression effects on embryonic development. Embryos from the experiment in Fig. 2 were fixed in 10% formalin and photographed. Examples are shown of embryos injected with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O (control (Con), A), FGFR-VT+ (B), and FGFR-VT− (C). Scale bar, 1.0 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The VT+ abnormalities were similar to those reported by Amaya et al. (10.Amaya E. Musci T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 257-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) in embryos overexpressing a dominant negative FGFR1 (XFD). These authors showed that XFD inhibited endogenous FGFR signaling and that overexpression in embryos caused severe posterior truncations resulting from a reduction in posterior mesoderm development, as well as deficiencies in gastrulation movements. This similarity suggested that the VT+ phenotype may result from a deficiency in mesoderm formation. To test this, we investigated the effect of VT+ and VT− overexpression on mesoderm formation in vitro and in vivo. First, we measured the FGF-2 dose-response curve in explants from embryos microinjected with either VT+ or VT− cRNA and compared it with the curve for explants from H2O-injected embryos. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of the VT+ isoform reduced the level of mesoderm induction by FGF-2; overexpressing explants required a 2-fold higher concentration of FGF than control explants to achieve 50% induction (Fig. 5 A). Explants overexpressing the VT− isoform, on the other hand, reached 50% induction at a 5-fold lower concentration than control explants (Fig. 5 A). Thus, overexpression of VT+ decreased sensitivity to FGF, while overexpression of VT− dramatically increased sensitivity. Examination of the VT− and VT+ expression levels in these explants revealed that the sensitivity to FGF was directly correlated with the relative expression levels of the two isoforms (Fig.5 B). The ratio of VT− to VT+ in explants from VT+-injected embryos was half that of control explants (Fig. 5 B,lanes 1 and 3), as was the proportion of induced VT+ explants at virtually every concentration of FGF tested (Fig. 5 A). Explants from VT−-injected embryos, on the other hand, had the highest ratio of VT− to VT+ (Fig. 5 B,lane 5) and the highest sensitivity to FGF (Fig.5 A). In fact, 30% of the latter were induced in the absence of added FGF-2 (Fig. 5 A). This autoinduction may result from interaction of overexpressed VT− with maternally derived FGF present in animal cap explants (9.Isaacs H.V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). From the results of the dose-response curves, one would predict that overexpressing the VT+ isoform would result in a decreased level of mesoderm formation in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of an early panmesodermal markerXbra, which is normally expressed throughout the presumptive mesoderm of the early gastrula stage embryo (26.Smith J.C. Price B.M. Green J.B. Weigel D. Herrmann B.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FGFR signaling is required for Xbra expression (reviewed in Ref.27.Schulte-Merker S. Smith J.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 62-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Staining for Xbra was not detectable or was very faint in VT+-injected embryos (Fig.6 A). VT−-injected embryos, on the other hand, expressed levels similar to those of H2O-injected controls (Fig. 6 A). Expression ofchordin, a dorsal lip marker involved in neural development (28.Sasai Y. Lu B Steinbeisser H. Geissert D. Gont L.K. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 29.Sasai Y. Lu B. Steinbeisser H. De Robertis E.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), was unaffected in VT+ embryos (Fig. 6 B), demonstrating that lack of Xbra expression in VT+-injected embryos was not the result of a nonspecific inhibition of transcription. Thus, the VT+ isoform can function to negatively regulate mesoderm formation in Xenopus embryos. In this study, we have shown that while the VT+ isoform was predominant in the presumptive mesoderm during most of blastula stages, a brief but dramatic increase in VT− mRNA expression occurred during this time period (Fig. 1 C), coinciding temporally with mesoderm induction in vivo (9.Isaacs H.V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It would be important to determine how this transient burst in VT− expression affects known FGF signaling pathways in the embryo, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and phospholipase Cγ. Labonne and Whitman (30.Labonne C. Whitman M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) reported that mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was first detectable during midblastula and peaked by midgastrula. Phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ, on the other hand, occurred over a period of 1.5 h during early blastula to midblastula stages (18.Ryan P.J. Gillespie L.L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). While activation of these pathways persisted over a longer time interval than that reported in this study, it is possible that the VT− protein has a longer half-life than its cognate mRNA. We are attempting to generate antibodies that can distinguish between the VT+ and VT− isoforms and would enable investigation of isoform-specific signaling pathways. We have also shown that the VT+ and VT− isoforms differ significantly in their ability to mediate mesoderm induction. This difference in isoform function could be due to PKC activity. PKC is known to be activated during mesoderm induction by FGF (4.Gillespie L.L. Paterno G.D. Mahadevan L.C. Slack J.M.W. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and activated PKC caused a substantial reduction in FGF signaling through the VT+, but not the VT−, isoform (7.Gillespie L.L. Chen G. Paterno G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22758-22763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The differential activity of these two FGFR isoforms means that two tissues in the embryo, one expressing predominantly VT− and the other predominantly VT+, could be exposed to the same, low concentration of FGF, and only the tissue expressing high levels of VT− would be induced. Our data suggest then that mesoderm formation in vivo is dependent not only on the local concentration of FGF but also on the relative expression levels of the VT+ and VT− isoforms in the responding tissue. This hypothesis provides a possible mechanism for restricting mesoderm induction to marginal zone cells, although all cells in the blastula stage embryo have been shown to express FGFRs (11.Cornell R.A. Musci T.J. Kimelman D. Development. 1995; 121: 2429-2437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Gillespie L.L. Paterno G.D. Slack J.M.W. Development. 1989; 106: 203-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While much of the work on mesoderm induction has focused on analysis of potential inducers, such as eFGF, activin, and Vg1 (reviewed in Refs. 9.Isaacs H.V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31.McDowell N. Gurdon J.B. Semin. Cell Dev.

Development. 1998; 125: 2677-2685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our results demonstrate that regulated expression of receptors and receptor isoforms also plays a critical role.

Physiol. 1994; 267: C1729-C1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study (20.Nunoki K. Ishii K. Okada H. Yamagishi T. Murakoshi H. Taira N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24138-24142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we made dimeric cDNA by tandem linkage of the rapidly inactivating K+ channel clone Kv1.4 and the noninactivating K+ channel clone Kv1.2 isolated from rat heart. The dimeric cDNA encodes a hybrid channel that is composed of Kv1.4 and Kv1.2 subunits with 1:1 stoichiometry. In the hybrid channel there are two inactivation balls tethered to Kv1.4 subunits. This approach revealed that in the hybrid channel inactivation is determined not only by inactivation balls but also by the composition of the pore-forming α-subunits, of which intracellular loops form the receptor sites for inactivation balls. It is, however, inappropriate to use hybrid channels to examine the relationship between inactivation kinetics and the number of inactivation balls, because the heterogeneity of the receptors for inactivation balls has, in itself, a certain effect on inactivation kinetics. In this study we investigated how inactivation kinetics are regulated by inactivation balls in rat Kv1.4 channels. For this purpose we made tandem dimeric and tetrameric cDNAs from a Kv1.4 clone, and homogeneous populations of K+ channels with one, two, or four inactivation balls were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The ratio of the inactivation rate constant of the channel with one or two inactivation balls to the Kv1.4 channel with four balls was larger than expected. This suggests that in rat Kv1.4 channels some interaction may exist between inactivation balls although previous studies in Shaker K+ channels have suggested that inactivation balls are independent (21.MacKinnon R. Aldrich R.W. Lee A.W. Science. 1993; 262: 757-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22.Gomez-Lagunus F. Armstrong C.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two different dimeric cDNA constructs were generated from the cDNA clone, Kv1.4 isolated from rat cardiac muscle (23.Okada H. Ishii K. Nunoki K. Abe T. Taira N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One was generated by tandem linkage of two Kv1.4 sequences and another by linking the 3′ end of the first Kv1.4 to the 5′ end-deleted Kv1.4. Kv1.4 cDNA coding for the first (the 5′ site) subunit of the tandem dimer was altered on the 3′ end by introduction of the linker sequence recognized bySpeI, which replaced the stop codon nucleotides 1963–1965. PCR1 amplification was performed to generate the BstEII (nucleotide 1560)/SpeI fragment (fragment I). Fragment I was ligated back into Kv1.4 in pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) (intermediate construct). For the second position of the tandem dimers, Kv1.4 cDNA was altered at the 5′ end or nucleotide 436G (N-terminal end of assembly domain) by adding the SpeI restriction site. The SpeI/MluI (nucleotide 531) fragments were amplified by PCR (fragments II and II′). Fragments II or II′ and theMluI/NotI fragment from Kv1.4 in pBluescript were ligated into the corresponding sites of the 3′ end-modified intermediate construct digested with SpeI andNotI. The tandem dimers generated in this manner were Kv1.4-Kv1.4 (full dimer) and Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–145 (partial dimer). The procedure for constructing tandem dimeric cDNA, Kv1.4-Kv1.2 was described in detail elsewhere (20.Nunoki K. Ishii K. Okada H. Yamagishi T. Murakoshi H. Taira N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24138-24142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tandem tetrameric cDNA of Kv1.4 was constructed using Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–145. Two dimeric cDNAs were linked by six nucleotides recognized bySplI. 5′ and 3′ ends of partial tandem dimers were altered by PCR for introduction of the SplI site. PCR was performed using a sense oligonucleotide containing the BstEII site and an antisense oligonucleotide containing SplI andEcoRI sites and the last 21 nucleotides. The PCR product was ligated into a partial dimeric cDNA in pBluescript digested withBstEII and EcoRI (3′ end modified partial dimeric cDNA). A fragment was amplified by PCR with a sense primer containing HindIII and SplI sites, and 21 nucleotides from 436G and an antisense primer containing theMluI site in Kv1.4. The amplified fragment was ligated into the corresponding site in a partial dimeric cDNA following digestion with HindIII and MluI (5′ end modified partial dimeric cDNA). Both 3′ and 5′ end modified partial dimeric cDNAs were digested by SplI and NotI and ligated into the complete tandem tetrameric constructs. The pBluescript vectors containing the dimeric or tetrameric constructs were linearized with EcoRI, and cRNAs were prepared from these templates with T7 RNA polymerase using MEGAscript RNA synthesis kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Procedures for preparation of Xenopus oocytes and injection of the synthesized cRNAs were the same as those described previously (20.Nunoki K. Ishii K. Okada H. Yamagishi T. Murakoshi H. Taira N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24138-24142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K+ currents were recorded by conventional two-microelectrode voltage clamp with 3 m KCl filled electrodes. The bath recording solution consisted of ND 96 (mM): NaCl, 96; KCl, 2; CaCl2, 1.8; MgCl2, 1; Hepes, 5; pH 7.5 adjusted with NaOH. All electrophysiological measurements were carried out at room temperature (21 ± 1 °C). Statistical analysis of the data was performed with analysis of variance and significance isolated by Dunnett's test. Values in the text, figures, and tables are given as means ± S.E. The schematic diagrams of the polypeptides encoded by tandem dimeric and tetrameric Kv1.4 cDNAs are shown in Fig.1 A. Polypeptide (Kv1.4-Kv1.4) encoded by the full tandem dimeric cDNA has amino acid sequence corresponding to ball and chain region in the second (3′ site) subunit as well as in the first subunit. On the other hand, polypeptide (Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–145) from the partial tandem dimeric cDNA lacks amino acid sequence corresponding to ball and chain region in the second subunit. Channels formed by the partial tandem polypeptide of Kv1.4 have two tethered inactivation balls, whereas the full tandem dimeric cDNA encodes channels with two tethered inactivation balls and two positioned in the loops connecting the subunits (Fig.1 B, b and c). Because the polypeptide encoded by the tandem tetrameric cDNA lacks amino acid sequences preceding the assembly domain in each subunit except the first one, there is only one inactivation ball per channel (Fig. 1 B,d). The currents observed when cRNAs of the tandem dimeric and tetrameric constructs were injected into the oocytes showed similar characteristics to Kv1.4 (Fig. 2,B–E). The current-voltage relationships of Kv1.4-Kv1.4, Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–145, Kv1.4-[Kv1.4Δ1–145]3, and Kv1.4-Kv1.2 (hybrid) channels were quite similar to Kv1.4. However, the currents generated by Kv1.4-Kv1.4, Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–145, and Kv1.4-[Kv1.4Δ1–145]3 inactivated more slowly than Kv1.4. A comparison of the current decay for Kv1.4, Kv1.4-Kv1.4, Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–145, Kv1.4-[Kv1.4Δ1–145]3, and Kv1.4-Kv1.2 at a potential of +20 mV is shown in Fig.3. Time constants τinactfor test pulses to +20 mV are presented in TableI. The time constants of inactivation for Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–145 and Kv1.4-[Kv1.4Δ1–145]3 were significantly increased compared with Kv1.4, whereas the difference in time constants between Kv1.4 and Kv1.4-Kv1.4 was not statistically significant. The time constant for Kv1.4-Kv1.2 did not differ from that for Kv1.4 as described previously (20.Nunoki K. Ishii K. Okada H. Yamagishi T. Murakoshi H. Taira N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24138-24142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). In addition to the slowing of current decay, inactivation became less complete as the number of inactivation balls on a channel was decreased. It was estimated from the exponential fits of current decay that noninactivating currents generated by Kv1.4, Kv1.4-Kv1.4, Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–145, and Kv1.4-[Kv1.4Δ1–145]3 were about 3, 6, 9, and 18% of the peak currents, respectively.Figure 3Time courses of inactivation in the expressed channels.

The numbers given in parentheses represent oocytes tested. Differences between channels were analyzed by variance, and the statistical significance was isolated using Dunnett's test. Time courses of recovery from inactivation for the channels are shown in Fig. 4. Recovery from inactivation was significantly faster in the hybrid channel than in Kv1.4 channels. There were no differences in the time constants for recovery between Kv1.4 channels with different numbers of inactivation balls. Time constants for recovery from inactivation τrec of the channels tested are presented in Table I. To gain a more precise insight into the inactivation process, we estimated the microscopic rate constants of inactivation (k inact) and recovery from inactivation (k rec) for individual channels as described previously (20.Nunoki K. Ishii K. Okada H. Yamagishi T. Murakoshi H. Taira N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24138-24142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We calculated the values ofk inact only from the oocytes in which both the time constants for inactivation and recovery from inactivation were measured (Table II). The ratio ofk inact for Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–145 to Kv1.4 is 0.65. This indicates that the microscopic inactivation rate constant of the channel with two inactivation balls is more than half that of Kv1.4 channel with four inactivation balls. Furthermore, the ratio ofk inact for Kv1.4-[Kv1.4Δ1–145]3to Kv1.4 is 0.4, indicating that the microscopic inactivation rate constant of the channel with only one inactivation ball is larger than one-fourth that of Kv1.4 channel. The k inactvalue of the Kv1.4-Kv1.4 channel was smaller than that of the Kv1.4 channel, although both types of channels have the same number of inactivation balls. When the values of k inactwere compared between Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–145 and Kv1.4-Kv1.2 channels, it became evident that k inact for the Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–145 channel is smaller than that of the hybrid channel. This could be attributed to the difference in the composition and the structure of the receptor sites for inactivation balls, because Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–145 and the hybrid channels have the same number of inactivation balls.Table IIRate constants of inactivation and recovery from inactivation of the expressed channelsk inactRatio to Kv1.4k recRatio to Kv1.4s −1s −1Kv1.416.8 ± 0.9(24)10.12 ± 0.01(24)1Kv1.4-Kv1.413.2 ± 1.2ap < 0.01.(13)0.780.12 ± 0.01(13)1.00Kv1.4-Kv1.4Δ1–14511.0 ± 0.5bp < 0.001 versus Kv1.4.(18)0.650.14 ± 0.01(18)1.17Kv1.4-[Kv1.4Δ1–145]36.7 ± 0.2bp < 0.001 versus Kv1.4.(20)0.400.13 ± 0.01(20)1.10Kv1.4-Kv1.212.6 ± 1.4ap < 0.01.

The average values of the parameters are summarized in TableIII. There were no differences between Kv1.4 channels with different numbers of inactivation balls except in the noninactivating component.

Inactivation of Kv1.4 channel is caused by occlusion of the intracellular mouth of the pore by the inactivation ball located in the N terminus of the polypeptide as in the ShakerK+ channel (2.Tseng-Crank J.

As polypeptides of the principle subunit of voltage-gated K+ channels form tetramers (6.MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 7.Liman E.R. Tytgat J.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is evident that Kv1.4 has four inactivation balls on each channel when expressed alone. Relationship between inactivation balls and rate of inactivation has been examined using Shaker B channel. To investigate the relationship, MacKinnon et al. (21.MacKinnon R. Aldrich R.W. Lee A.W. Science. 1993; 262: 757-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) studied channels carrying a specific mutation in a single subunit quantitatively by monitoring scorpion toxin sensitivity. On the other hand, Gomez-Lagunus and Armstrong (22.Gomez-Lagunus F. Armstrong C.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) used the approach of gradually removing inactivation with intracellular papain. However, these analytical procedures were based on the assumption that co-assembly of wild-type and mutated subunits or the predicted fraction of channels with various numbers of inactivation balls after protease treatment obeys the rules of a binomial distribution. In this study we have investigated the role of inactivation balls in the rate of inactivation by use of a different strategy than these reports. This approach seems to have the advantage that interpretation of the results does not need any assumptions about subunit stoichiometry. To constrain the number of inactivation balls in the expressed channels, dimeric and tetrameric cDNAs were constructed from rat cDNA clone Kv1.4, which encode two or four Kv1.4 subunits on a single polypeptide chain (Fig. 1 A). It has been demonstrated that two polypeptides encoded by the dimeric cDNA construct can assemble to form functional channels with tetrameric structure (7.Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 11.Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Siegelbaum S.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For K+ channels, tetrameric cDNA constructs also encode functional channels resembling, in their electrophysiological properties, those expressed from monomers (7.Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 11.Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Therefore, it is probable that the channels have two or only one inactivation ball when the partial tandem dimeric or tetrameric cDNAs of Kv1.4 are expressed in Xenopusoocytes. The voltage dependence of activation and inactivation of the channels with different numbers of inactivation balls is similar, suggesting that alterations in inactivation should be attributed to the difference in the number of inactivation balls. We have demonstrated directly that the channels that have only one ball can inactivate, which is consistent with the results with Shaker K+channels described by MacKinnon et al. (21.MacKinnon R. Aldrich R.W. Lee A.W. Science. 1993; 262: 757-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, inactivation of the current from the channel with only one ball was incomplete in our experimental conditions, compared with the channel with four balls. Increases in the noninactivating currents may be due to less frequent occlusion of the pore by a smaller number of particles. Transitions between open and closed states before entering the inactivated state might be another possibility. The ratios of the inactivation rate constants from the channel with one and two balls were larger than one-fourth and one-half that of the channel with four balls, respectively. MacKinnon et al. (21.MacKinnon R. Aldrich R.W. Lee A.W. Science. 1993; 262: 757-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) described that in Shaker K+ channels the rate constant for the channel with a single gate was one-fourth that of channels with four gates and suggested independence of each inactivation gate. We considered the following possibilities that might account for the difference. First, there may be some interaction between inactivation balls: electrostatic repulsion between balls due to positive charges on their surfaces could decrease access of inactivation balls to their receptor sites when a channel has more than a single ball. Second, slow recovery of Kv1.4 may result in larger rate constants than expected for the channels with one and two inactivation balls. Recovery from inactivation of Kv1.4 is much slower than that of the Shaker K+ channel. Kv1.4 has more positive charges than the Shaker K+ channel in its ball structure, which could result in a higher affinity of the inactivation ball for its receptor. There is also another possibility that might arise from the experimental strategy. Structural changes induced by linkage of the subunits in a single polypeptide chain might alter accessibility of inactivation balls to their receptor sites. The channels that have two tethered balls and two in the connecting loop showed an inactivation rate constant that was intermediate between channels with four tethered balls and those with two balls. This indicates that the ball structure positioned in the loop also functions as an inactivation gate, but its access to the receptor was decreased due to restricted movement. In this study we have isolated the current of Kv1.4 channel with a single or two inactivation balls for the first time by expressing homogeneous populations of channels in Xenopus oocytes. It was demonstrated that rat Kv1.4 channel could inactivate even with only a single inactivation ball, although inactivation was not complete. The calculated microscopic rate constants for inactivation of the channels with a single and two inactivation balls were larger than would be expected if inactivation balls were independent, suggesting the possibility of some interaction between inactivation balls. Single channel analysis will provide unequivocal estimation of differences in microscopic rate constants of inactivation and the mechanism underlying the noninactivating fraction of the currents.

Most of them belong to two common classes (for review, see Refs. 1.Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar and 2.Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin.

Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), or by a dileucine motif (4.Sandoval I.V. Bakke O.

In several cases, signals of either type also function in endocytosis from the plasma membrane and in direct lysosomal sorting from thetrans-Golgi network (TGN)1 to endosomes and lysosomes (for review, see Refs. 2.Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar and 6.Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Other basolateral sorting signals contain neither an essential tyrosine nor a dileucine motif (e.g. the polyimmunoglobulin receptor (7.Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)). Little is known about the identity of apical signals. However, they appear to be localized to the noncytosolic segments of membrane proteins because truncation mutants lacking the cytosolic and transmembrane portions were generally found to retain apical polarity (8.Vogel L.K.

Other proteins, however, did not depend on N-glycosylation for correct delivery (15.Gonzalez A. Nicovani S. Juica F. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which suggests several mechanisms for apical sorting. Recently, a role of the transmembrane domain in apical sorting has been demonstrated for several proteins (18.Kundu A. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 20.Lin S. Naim H.Y. Chapin Rodriguez A. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Generally, cytoplasmic basolateral signals were found to be dominant over exoplasmic apical determinants. Mutant forms of basolateral membrane proteins lacking their cytosolic signals were often sorted predominantly to the apical surface (e.g. low density lipoprotein receptor, Fc receptor, lysosomal acid phosphatase (21.Mostov K.E. de Bruyn Kops A. Deitcher D.L. Cell. 1986; 47: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22.Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)), reflecting the existence of recessive apical determinants. Insertion of a tyrosine into the small cytosolic domain of influenza hemagglutinin redirected the protein to the basolateral surface (24.Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Most importantly, fusion of cytosolic basolateral signals to transmembrane and exoplasmic domains of apical proteins resulted in basolateral transport (18.Kundu A. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Prill V. Lehmann L. von Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25.Casanova J.E.

Based on these observations, it appeared that binding of cytoplasmic signals to recognition proteins in the coats forming basolateral transport vesicles at the TGN generally overruled the interaction of apical determinants with their sorting machinery. In this study, we have analyzed the polarized transport of two fusion proteins, HN and TN, consisting of the exoplasmic and transmembrane domains of aminopeptidase N (APN) and the cytosolic portions either of the asialoglycoprotein receptor subunit H1 or of the transferrin receptor (TfR). APN is an apical, resident plasma membrane protein (29.Wessels H.P. Hansen G.H. Fuhrer C. Look A.T. Sjöström H. Norén O. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2923-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Apical sorting information resides in the exoplasmic portion because soluble forms lacking the membrane anchor were secreted apically as well (8.Vogel L.K. Spiess M. Sjöström H. Norén O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2794-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Vogel L.K. Norén O. Sjöström H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, H1 and TfR are basolateral proteins that cycle between the plasma membrane and endosomes. The information for endocytosis and basolateral sorting resides in the cytosolic portion of both proteins. A tyrosine motif (Tyr-5) is essential for both efficient internalization and polarized expression of H1 (30.Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31.Geffen I. Fuhrer C. Leitinger B. Weiss M. Huggel K. Griffiths G. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20772-20777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Internalization of TfR was shown to depend on the motif YXRF (32.Rothenberger S. Iacopetta B.J. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1987; 49: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas basolateral transport depends mainly on residues 29–35 containing neither a tyrosine nor a dileucine motif (33.Dargemont C. Lebivic A. Rothenberger S. Iacopetta B. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34.Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the two fusion proteins, expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, showed different fates with respect to endocytosis, to initial polarized sorting at the TGN, and to steady-state polarity. The results might be explained by the number of signals presented by different protein oligomers, suggesting an important contribution of the valence of signals in polarized sorting. The cDNA sequences encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor subunit H1 (codons 1–40) and of the mouse transferrin receptor (plasmid pMTR-1, from L. Kühn; codons 1–64) were fused to the transmembrane and exoplasmic domains of human APN (codons 10–967) by polymerase chain reaction and “splicing by overlap extension” (35.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar, 36.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). The resulting hybrid cDNAs were subcloned into the expression plasmid pLJ (37.Korman A.J. Frantz J.D. Strominger J.L. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2150-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Similarly, codons 1–40 of H1 were fused to the transmembrane and exoplasmic domains of neuraminidase (NA; codons 7–450), and the resulting construct, HNA, was subcloned into the expression plasmid pCB6. Maintenance and transfection of MDCK cell lines (strain II) were as described previously (29.Wessels H.P. Hansen G.H. Fuhrer C. Look A.T. Sjöström H. Norén O. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2923-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Clonal cell lines resistant to 1 mg/ml G418-sulfate were isolated and screened for expression by surface antibody binding or metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum directed against human APN or against influenza virus NA (an antiserum raised against total virus, strain A/WSN/33; from D. Nayak, UCLA). Labeling with [35S]methionine or35S[sulfate] and immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (29.Wessels H.P. Hansen G.H. Fuhrer C. Look A.T. Sjöström H. Norén O. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2923-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38.Leitinger B. Brown J.L. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8115-8121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines expressing NA and HNA were incubated overnight with 10 mm sodium butyrate before experiments to enhance expression (18.Kundu A. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For deglycosylation, the immune complexes were released from protein A-Sepharose by boiling in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6, 1% SDS, and incubated with 1 milliunit of endo-β-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) for 5 h at 37 °C. To identify disulfide-linked oligomers, samples were boiled in SDS-sample buffer with or without 0.2m β-mercaptoethanol before gel electrophoresis. For separate access to the apical or basolateral cell surface, MDCK cell lines were grown to confluence on polycarbonate filters (0.4-μm pore size) in 24-mm Transwell chambers (Costar). Tightness of the monolayers was assayed as described (39.Wessels H.P. Geffen I. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polarized surface distribution of wild-type and chimeric APN was determined by surface antibody binding (39.Wessels H.P. Geffen I. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by surface immunoprecipitation. For the latter procedure, filter-grown cells were incubated for 30 min in methionine-free minimal essential medium and labeled from the basolateral side with the same medium supplemented with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 6 h. The cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-APN antiserum (diluted 1:500) from either the apical or basolateral surface, rinsed five times, and scraped into lysis buffer. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Initial surface appearance was assayed similarly by surface immunoprecipitation, except that cells were starved for 30 min at 20 °C to accumulate proteins at the TGN. The cells were then labeled with [35S]sulfate for 60 min at 20 °C and for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Antibody was present in the apical or basolateral compartment throughout the labeling time and an additional 60 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed and immune complexes isolated with protein A-Sepharose. Nonprecipitated material was subjected to a second immunoprecipitation as a control for total expression. Polarity of wild-type and chimeric NA was determined either by metabolic labeling, surface biotinylation, and consecutive precipitation with antibody-protein A and avidin-agarose as described (18.Kundu A. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or using unlabeled cells, by surface biotinylation, immunoprecipitation, SDS-gel electrophoresis, blotting, and detection with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. MDCK cell lines were grown to subconfluence in 35-mm plates, labeled with [35S]sulfate for 1 h, and washed at 4 °C with PBS without calcium, which opens the tight junctions and facilitates access of reagents to the basolateral surfaces (40.Martinez-Palomo A. Meza I. Beaty G. Cereijido M. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 736-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The cell surface was then biotinylated for 30 min at 4 °C using 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3′dithiopropionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin; Pierce) in PBS. Excess reagent was quenched by washing the cells once with 50 mm glycine in PBS and twice with PBS. Cells were incubated for 0–30 min at 37 °C in complete minimal essential medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and washed with PBS at 4 °C. Except for the control cells, biotin exposed on the cell surface was removed by two 20-min incubations with a freshly prepared solution of reduced glutathione (50 mm in 75 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 75 mm NaOH). Excess glutathione was quenched by a 5-min incubation with 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide in PBS at 4 °C. Cells were washed and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Precipitated material was released from the beads by boiling in 2% SDS, diluted 10-fold with 0.5m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate in PBS, and reprecipitated with avidin agarose. The samples were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The signal recovered from control cells not stripped with glutathione was defined as 100%. The efficiency of biotinylation and avidin precipitation was determined to be ∼30% for HN. Because approximately half of the chimeras are intracellular at steady state based on the endocytosis experiments shown below, the majority of the polypeptides at the cell surface were recovered. APN, H1, and TfR are type II membrane proteins with a cytoplasmic NH2 terminus. The cytoplasmic domains of H1 and TfR (Fig.1) were fused to the transmembrane and exoplasmic portions of APN to construct the chimeric proteins HN and TN, respectively. The borders between the cytoplasmic portion and the transmembrane segment are delimited unambiguously in all sequences by a positively charged amino acid preceding a hydrophobic stretch of at least 20 amino acids. MDCK cells were transfected with the chimeric cDNAs, and expressing clonal cell lines were isolated. In Fig.2, lanes 1–4, expression of APN, HN, and TN was analyzed by labeling the corresponding cell lines for 1 h with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation using an APN-specific antiserum. Two forms of wild-type APN with apparent molecular masses of ∼120 and ∼150 kDa were detected, corresponding to the high mannose and complex glycosylated forms of the protein (29.Wessels H.P. Hansen G.H. Fuhrer C. Look A.T. Sjöström H. Norén O. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2923-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular masses of the two forms of HN and TN were slightly higher in agreement with the added size of their cytoplasmic portions. Parental MDCK cells were devoid of immunoreactive material. All three proteins could also be labeled with [35S]sulfate (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). Because sulfation occurs in the TGN, radioactivity was incorporated exclusively in the mature forms. Conversion of the high mannose to the complex glycosylated forms, as analyzed in pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 3), proceeded with a half-time of ∼30 min for APN and TN and of ∼1 h for HN. Both the rates and the extent of conversion indicate that the chimeras passed endoplasmic reticulum quality control quite efficiently and similarly to wild-type APN. It had been shown previously that APN forms noncovalent dimers in the endoplasmic reticulum and that dimerization is required for its transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum (41.Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14566-14571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,42.Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1599-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Rapid transport to the cell surface thus indicates that the heterologous cytoplasmic tails did not disturb dimerization of the APN portions in the chimeras.Figure 3Pulse-chase analysis. MDCK cell lines expressing APN, HN, or TN were labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min followed by a chase of up to 120 min in the presence of excess unlabeled methionine. APN and the chimeras were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The high mannose and complex glycosylated forms are indicated by hm and c, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Endocytosis of H1 is critically dependent on the same tyrosine signal necessary for basolateral sorting (31.Geffen I. Fuhrer C. Leitinger B. Weiss M. Huggel K. Griffiths G. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20772-20777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether in the chimera this bifunctional signal is effective for interaction with clathrin adaptors at the plasma membrane, endocytosis of HN was analyzed. Cells expressing the chimeras, wild-type APN, or H1TS (a variant of H1 which was tagged at the luminal COOH terminus with a tyrosine-sulfation site (38.Leitinger B. Brown J.L. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8115-8121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were [35S]sulfate labeled and then derivatized at the surface at 4 °C with the impermeant, cleavable reagent sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. After incubation at 37 °C for different times, surface biotin was stripped at 4 °C by incubation with glutathione. Internalized biotinylated proteins were isolated by consecutive immunoprecipitation and precipitation with avidin-agarose. Wild-type APN was not significantly internalized within 30 min, whereas the two chimeric proteins HN and TN were specifically endocytosed, although at different rates (Fig. 4). TN was internalized at a rate of ∼11%/min and reached its equilibrium distribution rapidly. This rate is in excellent agreement with the rate determined for the wild-type TfR in MDCK cells (43.Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 199: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HN was internalized at a rate of ∼2.5%/min. The cytoplasmic domain of H1 was thus also sufficient to induce endocytosis, however, only at less than half the rate it generated in its wild-type context. H1TS was internalized at ∼7%/min, which is identical to the rate determined for untagged H1 in fibroblasts (44.Geffen I. Fuhrer C. Spiess M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8425-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To assess the polarity of the chimeric proteins, the cells were grown to confluence on filters and incubated at 4 °C first with APN-specific antibodies added either to the apical or basolateral side and then with 125I-protein A added to both surfaces. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Fig.5 A). In a separate assay, the cells were first metabolically labeled and then incubated at 4 °C with APN-specific antibodies from either the apical or the basolateral side. After lysis, immune complexes were isolated with protein A-Sepharose and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and fluorography (Fig. 5 B). Both methods yielded the same results. Whereas wild-type APN was sorted efficiently to the apical surface to approximately 80%, TN was expressed with equal efficiency on the basolateral surface. As expected, the basolateral signal of the TfR tail was dominant over the apical determinants in APN. In contrast, HN was detected to ∼80% on the apical surface, like APN. To test whether selective degradation at the basolateral side might cause predominantly apical polarity of the HN chimera, its half-life was determined in a pulse-chase experiment. The [35S]sulfate-labeled constructs were equally stable over a time period of 8 h, showing extrapolated half-lives of ∼12 h for APN and ∼15 h for HN and TN (Fig.6). This suggested that the opposite polarities of HN and TN were the result of different sorting mechanisms and that the cytosolic signal of H1 was not sufficient to determine the polarity of the chimera. To test whether HN is sorted directly to the apical surface or transcytosed via the basolateral surface, we determined the polarity of newly synthesized molecules at their first arrival at the cell surface. To improve sensitivity, the cells were labeled with [35S]sulfate for 60 min at 20 °C, which blocks surface transport, and for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. To capture the protein as it appeared at the cell surface, antibody was present in the apical or basolateral compartment throughout the labeling time and an additional 60 min at 4 °C. 30 min at 37 °C is insufficient for a significant amount of protein to be transported first to one cell surface (t 1/2 > 10 min (45.Leitinger B. Hille-Rehfeld A. Spiess M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10109-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)) and then to be transcytosed to the other (e.g. t 1/2 ∼30 min for the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (46.Mostov K.E. Deitcher D.L. Cell. 1986; 46: 613-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar)). After lysis, immune complexes were isolated. APN and TN showed the same initial polarity as at steady state (Fig.7). In contrast, HN first appeared predominantly on the basolateral surface, although with lesser efficiency than TN. This indicates that the signal in the cytoplasmic domain of H1 is largely functional to direct HN from the TGN to the basolateral side but is unable to maintain this initial polarity. A possible explanation for the reduced efficiency of the basolateral and endocytic determinants of H1 in the chimera compared with those of the TfR is the oligomeric state of the proteins. H1 forms noncovalent homotrimers through an exoplasmic α-helical coiled-coil stalk segment (47.Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 48.Bider M.D. Wahlberg J.M. Kammerer R.A. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31996-32001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The TfR and APN, on the other hand, are dimers (41.Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14566-14571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1599-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 49.Schneider C. Sutherland R. Newman R. Greaves M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8516-8522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the dimeric context of the APN chimeras, two copies of the cytoplasmic signals are presented. At least three copies of the basolateral signal of H1 might be required for efficient basolateral sorting and maintenance. To test this hypothesis, we constructed the chimera HNA, consisting of the cytoplasmic domain of H1 fused to the transmembrane and exoplasmic portions of influenza virus NA (Fig. 1). NA is a tetrameric type II membrane protein composed of two disulfide-linked dimers and is sorted to the apical surface in MDCK cells (18.Kundu A. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A fusion protein with the cytoplasmic domain of TfR has been shown previously to be redirected to the basolateral surface (18.Kundu A. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HNA was initially synthesized as two differently glycosylated, endo H-sensitive proteins with apparent molecular masses of around 60 kDa on a reducing gel (Fig.8 A, lanes 1 and2). Rapid oligomerization was apparent on a nonreducing gel in disulfide-linked products of ∼125 kDa (lane 9). Within 2 h of chase, almost 50% of the protein was converted to heterogeneous endo H-resistant forms (Fig. 8 A), very similar to wild-type NA (50.Kundu A. Avalos R.T. Sanderson C.M. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6508-6515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the steady-state polarity of HNA and NA, filter-grown MDCK cell lines were labeled with [35S]methionine for 5 h, then biotinylated at 4 °C from the basolateral or apical side, lysed, and precipitated first with streptavidin-agarose and then with an antiserum against NA and protein A-Sepharose. Whereas wild-type NA was recovered almost exclusively from the apical side, HNA was detected to 74% from the basolateral surface (Fig. 8 B). In this tetrameric chimera, the cytoplasmic domain of H1 thus was sufficient to confer basolateral polarity. The cytoplasmic domain of TfR was sufficient for efficient basolateral sorting of a fusion protein with the transmembrane and exoplasmic portions of APN. This result is in agreement with the behavior of a similar fusion protein with the transmembrane and exoplasmic domains of NA, which was also redirected to the basolateral side (18.Kundu A. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, most studies in which basolateral sorting signals were either mutated inside normally basolateral proteins or matched against apical determinants in chimeric proteins suggested that basolateral signals were generally dominant over apical determinants. In contrast, the cytoplasmic portion of H1 did not invert the steady-state polarity of APN when fused to its transmembrane and exoplasmic domains. Although it was sufficient to direct at least a majority of the newly synthesized fusion proteins to the basolateral surface initially, it failed to maintain this polarity, and the protein was redistributed to the apical side in subsequent sorting steps. This is reminiscent of the sorting pathway of apical proteins in hepatocytes (51.Bartles J.R. Feracci H.M. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar): apical proteins are first delivered to the basolateral surface and then transported to the apical surface by transcytosis. In the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2, an intermediate situation has been observed with some apical proteins transported directly to their destination and others at least in part via the basolateral membrane (52.Matter K. Brauchbar M. Bucher K. Hauri H.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 429-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because basolateral proteins always take a direct route in Caco-2 cells, basolateral sorting in the TGN appears to be less exclusive than in endosomes upon endocytosis. In MDCK cells, both apical and basolateral proteins are generally sorted directly (53.Wandinger-Ness A. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, it has been demonstrated previously that there are two stations for polarized sorting also in MDCK cells: in exocytosis at the level of the TGN and upon endocytosis in endosomes (34.Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 50.Kundu A. Avalos R.T. Sanderson C.M. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6508-6515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the low density lipoprotein receptor as a model protein, it was shown that the same signals directing polarized sorting in the TGN also control recycling and transcytosis after internalization from either cell surface domain, suggesting related machineries (50.Kundu A. Avalos R.T. Sanderson C.M. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6508-6515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of TfR mutants revealed differences in the recognition of basolateral determinants within the biosynthetic and endosomal pathways (34.Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). HN is a further example illustrating different properties of the two machineries for polarized sorting. The basolateral signal in HN is still recognized in the TGN, but not in endosomes. H1 and TfR are sorted by different types of signals. Whereas basolateral expression of H1 depends on a typical tyrosine motif, YQDL (31.Geffen I. Fuhrer C. Leitinger B. Weiss M. Huggel K. Griffiths G. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20772-20777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the main basolateral determinant of TfR involves a stretch of 13 amino acids (residues 29–41) which does not contain any known motifs (34.Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This might thus suggest that different mechanisms exist for basolateral targeting (at least in endosomes), only some of which are dominant over apical determinants. However, other tyrosine motifs, similar to that in H1, have also been shown to be dominant (23.Prill V. Lehmann L. von Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24.Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 27.Thomas D.C. Brewer C.B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12219-12225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that both H1 and TfR are transported from the TGN to the cell surface indirectly via endosomal compartments (45.Leitinger B. Hille-Rehfeld A. Spiess M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10109-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 54.Futter C.E. Connolly C.N. Cutler D.F. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10999-11003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Candidate coats for recognition of basolateral proteins in the TGN are clathrin-associated AP-1 adaptor complexes, for which there is evidence that they recognize at least some tyrosine motifs (55.Höning S. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Hunziker W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5230-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 56.Heilker R. Manning-Krieg U. Zuber J.F. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 57.Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Fournier M.-C. Hennecke S. Cosson P. Virology. 1997; 238: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 58.Heilker R. Spiess M. Crottet P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recently, clathrin/AP-1 coats were detected on sorting endosomes of MDCK cells, i.e. endosomal structures accessible to TfR and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor from the apical and basolateral surface (59.Futter C.E. Gibson A. Allchin E.H. Maxwell S. Ruddock L.J. Odorizzi G. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Because in addition clathrin/AP-1 coats and basolateral sorting were similarly sensitive to brefeldin A treatment, these endosomal clathrin coats were proposed to be involved in basolateral surface transport of TfR (59.Futter C.E. Gibson A. Allchin E.H. Maxwell S. Ruddock L.J. Odorizzi G. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As an alternative to different basolateral sorting mechanisms, the basolateral signals in HN and TN may have different affinities for interaction with common coat components of basolateral transport vesicles. A potentially important factor in defining the interaction affinity of oligomeric proteins is the valence of signals presented. H1 forms noncovalent oligomers through an exoplasmic α-helical coiled-coil stalk segment that readily forms homotrimers in vitro (48.Bider M.D. Wahlberg J.M. Kammerer R.A. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31996-32001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). H1 homotrimers have also been observed in in vivo cross-linking experiments (47.Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The TfR, on the other hand, is a dimer (49.Schneider C. Sutherland R. Newman R. Greaves M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8516-8522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as are APN (41.Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14566-14571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1599-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and its derivatives. The behavior of HN suggests that at least three copies of the basolateral signal of H1 are required in a protein complex for basolateral expression and efficient endocytosis. The concept was tested with a tetrameric fusion construct of the cytoplasmic domain of H1 to NA. This protein was expressed basolaterally, consistent with the notion that the H1 signal needs to be presented at higher valence to be functional. The endocytosis signal of H1, which involves the same tyrosine motif required for basolateral sorting, is sufficient to induce internalization of HN. However, the internalization rate of the dimeric chimera is clearly lower than that of trimeric H1, consistent with a role of signal valence in defining the affinity for clathrin/AP-2-coated pits at the plasma membrane. A correlation between the number of functional endocytosis motifs in a protein oligomer and its internalization rate has also been shown by introducing a second tyrosine signal into the cytoplasmic domain of the TfR (60.Collawn J.F. Lai A. Domingo D. Fitch M. Hatton S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21686-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by coexpression at different ratios of wild-type and Tyr-to-Ala mutant chains of the macrophage asialoglycoprotein-binding protein (61.Ozaki K. Itoh N. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Arneson and Miller (62.Arneson L.S. Miller J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) analyzed the oligomeric requirements of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II invariant chain, which associates as a trimer with three MHC class II αβ dimers and contains the main determinants for transport of the complex from the TGN to an endosomal MHC class II compartment. At least two functional tails of invariant chain were required in a complex for efficient endosomal sorting, whereas one tail was sufficient to induce endocytosis from the plasma membrane. Very recently, another exception to the rule that basolateral signals are dominant over apical ones was published: the short cytoplasmic domain of hemagglutinin, a normally apical protein, mutated to contain tyrosine motifs was functional to redirect the mutant proteins to the basolateral side but was not sufficient to do so when fused to lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, an apical enzyme of the small intestine (63.Jacob R. Preuss U. Panzer P. Alfalah M. Quack S. Roth M.G. Naim H. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8061-8067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that not all mechanisms of apical sorting are necessarily recessive. Alternatively, this result could also be explained in terms of different valences of signals presented in the oligomers because hemagglutinin oligomerizes to trimers (64.Wiley D.C. Skehel J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 365-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), whereas lactase-phlorizin hydrolase only forms dimers (42.Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1599-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whether also in this case biosynthetic sorting to the basolateral membrane is still functional is not known. Our observations together with these results suggest that basolateral signals per se need not be dominant over apical determinants and emphasize an important contribution of the valence of signals in polarized sorting. —We thank Drs.

To determine where and how HL becomes activated, the effect of drugs that interfere with maturation and intracellular transport of HL protein was studied using freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. Carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), castanospermine, monensin, and colchicin all inhibited secretion of HL without affecting its specific enzyme activity. The specific enzyme activity of intracellular HL was decreased by 25–50% upon incubation with CCCP or castanospermine, and increased 2-fold with monensin and colchicin. Glucose trimming of HL protein was not affected by CCCP, as indicated by digestion of immunoprecipitates with jack bean α-mannosidase. Pulse labeling experiments with [35S]methionine indicated that conversion of the 53-kDa precursor to the 58-kDa form, nor the development of endoglycosidase H-resistance, were essential for acquisition of enzyme activity. In sucrose gradients, HL protein from secretion media sedimented as a homogeneous band of about 5.8 S, whereas HL protein from the cell lysates migrated as a broad band extending from 5.8 S to more than 8 S. With both sources, HL activity was exclusively associated with the 5.8 S HL protein form. We conclude that glucose trimming of HL protein in the endoplasmic reticulum is not sufficient for activation; full activation occurs during or after transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and is associated with a decrease in sedimentation velocity.

Kneser K. Nielsen M. Gliemann J. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 926-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, a low HL activity is associated with an increased atherosclerotic risk (10.Barth J.D. Jansen H. Kromhout D. Reiber J.H.C. Birkenhäger J.C. Arntzenius A.C.

When expressed in transgenic mice, human HL was shown to markedly reduce the accumulation of aortic cholesterol (12.Busch S.J. Barnhart R.L. Martin G.A. Fitzgerald M.C. Yates M.T. Mao S.J.T. Thomas C.E. Jackson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16376-16382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HL may protect against development of premature atherosclerosis by contributing to reverse cholesterol transport and reducing the number of atherogenic remnants in the circulation. Expression of HL in the liver is under hormonal and dietary control, which may be exerted at the level of synthesis, intracellular processing, secretion, extracellular binding, and internalization. When studying the post-translational control of HL expression in suspensions of freshly isolated rat hepatocytes, we noted that newly synthesized HL acquires catalytic activity toward triacylglycerols somewhere along the secretory pathway (13.Verhoeven A.J.M. Jansen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). First, the specific enzyme activity of intracellular HL was 3–5-fold lower than that of secreted HL. Second, HL activity secreted by hepatocytes in the absence of protein de novo synthesis was 5-fold higher than was accounted for by the fall in the intracellular HL activity. Such an apparent activation was also observed for human HL in the HepG2 hepatoma cell line (14.Verhoeven A.J.M. Neve B.P. Jansen H. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 133-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HL is a glycoprotein bearing two (rat) to four (human) asparagine-linked glycans (15.Doolittle M.H. Wong H. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1326-1333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Wölle J. Jansen H. Smith L.C. Chan L. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2169-2176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Ben-Zeev O. Stahnke G. Liu G. Davis R.C. Doolittle M.H. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1511-1523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the synthesis and secretion of fully active HL, N-glycosylation is a prerequisite (18.Leitersdorf E. Stein O. Stein Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 794: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19.Verhoeven A.J.M. Jansen H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1883-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When glycosylation is prevented, either by tunicamycin or by site-directed mutagenesis, inactive HL protein accumulates intracellularly (16.Wölle J. Jansen H. Smith L.C. Chan L. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2169-2176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Laposata E.A. Laboda H.M. Glick J.M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5333-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Along the secretory pathway, theN-linked oligosaccharide chains are extensively processed. In rat hepatocytes treated with castanospermine, a selective RER glucosidase inhibitor which prevents secretion of newly synthesized HL, inactive HL was present; upon removal of the inhibitor, the HL protein acquired catalytic activity and was secreted (13.Verhoeven A.J.M. Jansen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These observations show that newly synthesized HL protein becomes catalytically active during oligosaccharide processing after the terminal glucose residues have been removed by the glucosidases in the RER, and suggest that activation may be intimately linked to the glycosylation state of the HL protein. The presence of terminal glucoses on HL protein itself may prevent the acquisition of catalytic activity. However, the glucose residues onN-glycoproteins have recently been implicated in the protein folding and quality control system of the RER, which prevents malfolded proteins from reaching the Golgi (21.Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 22.Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). It is possible therefore, that glucose trimming is only required for transport of the newly synthesized HL out of the RER and that activation occurs subsequently in a distal compartment of the secretory pathway. In line with this, inhibition of the Golgi mannosidase I with 1-deoxymannojirimycin has no effect on either activation or secretion of HL in rat hepatocytes (13.Verhoeven A.J.M. Jansen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar,19.Verhoeven A.J.M. Jansen H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1883-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that once the glucose residues have been removed, activation and subsequent secretion proceed independently of further oligosaccharide processing. If glucose trimming in the RER is necessary for activation of HL protein itself rather than for transport of newly synthesized HL protein out of the RER, one would expect that inhibition of the transport process leads to the intracellular accumulation of active HL protein. The present study was performed to test this possibility. We determined in which intracellular compartment HL protein is activated, by using inhibitors that primarily affect vesicular transport in the secretory pathway. CCCP, monensin, and colchicin inhibit transport of glycoproteins from the RER to the Golgi (23.Burkhardt J.K. Argon Y. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 633-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Doms R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 191: 841-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), from medial- to trans-Golgi (25.Tartakoff A. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) and between the Golgi and the plasma membrane (26.Redman C.M. Banerjee D. Howell K. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 42-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar,27.Patzelt C. Brown D. Jeanrenaud B. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 73: 578-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), respectively. Our data show that active HL accumulates in monensin- and colchicin-treated hepatocytes, but not in cells treated with CCCP. Hence, glucose trimming alone does not activate HL but is necessary for translocation of HL protein to the Golgi compartment, where the protein apparently acquires its triglyceridase activity.

All other chemicals were from Sigma. Polystyrene 96-well EIA plates (code 3590) were from Costar (Cambridge, MA). Hepatocytes were isolated from male Wistar rats (200–250 g body weight) by collagenase perfusion: non-parenchymal cells were removed by differential centrifugation (29.Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and ranged from 85 to 90%. The cells were suspended at a density of 4 × 106 cells/ml in minimal essential medium containing 25 units/ml heparin and 20% of dialyzed, heat-inactivated bovine serum (30.Jansen H. Kalkman C.

Cell suspensions were incubated at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% O2 in a shaking water bath. The incubations were started with the addition of inhibitors. CCCP, monensin, and colchicin were added from 1000-fold stock solutions in ethanol; other inhibitors were added from 100-fold stocks in PBS. At the times indicated, samples of the cell suspension were collected on ice. The cells were separated from the medium by centrifugation for 5 s at 10,000 ×g. The cells were washed once in PBS and then resuspended at 15 × 106 cells/ml in a 40 mmNH4OH buffer, pH 8.1 (31.Kihara S. Wölle J. Ehnholm C. Chan L. Oka K. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 961-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), containing 25 units/ml heparin and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, 10 units/ml Trasylol, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin). After 30 min on ice, the lysates were sonicated for 15 s (MSE Soniprep 150, amplitude 14 μm) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 ×g and 4 °C. The supernatants were used for analysis of intracellular HL. Cell-free media and cleared lysates were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Hepatic lipase activity was determined by a triacylglycerol hydrolase assay at pH 8.5 in 0.6m NaCl using a gum acacia-stabilized glycerol [14C]trioleate emulsion as substrate (19.Verhoeven A.J.M. Jansen H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1883-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed for 30 min at 30 °C. Activities were expressed as milliunits (nanomoles of free fatty acids released per min). In a total assay volume of 125 μl, release of free fatty acids was linear with time and sample volume up to 50 μl for the cell-free media and 10 μl for the cell lysates. In immuno-inhibition assays, 40 μl of the cell-free media or 10 μl of the cell lysates were preincubated for 1 h on ice in a total volume of 50 μl with either 100 μg of goat non-immune IgGs or anti-rat HL IgGs. Thereafter, 75 μl of substrate was added to the supernatant, and the residual immunoresistant triglyceridase activity was determined. The lipase activity in the extracellular media was completely inhibited by the anti-HL IgGs whereas 85–95% of the lipase activity in the cell lysates was sensitive to immuno-inhibition. The amount of HL protein was determined by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in which the antigen was sandwiched between goat and rabbit polyclonal anti-HL IgGs. EIA plate wells were coated with 20 μg of goat anti-HL IgGs. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, the wells were incubated successively with: (i) sample, either 50 μl of cell-free medium or 5 μl of cell lysate; (ii) 3 μg/ml rabbit anti-HL IgGs in PBS, and (iii) alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a 1:1500 dilution in PBS. Finally, the presence of alkaline phosphatase was detected with p-nitrophenol phosphate as substrate. Color development was stopped with NaOH (1 m, final concentration), and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured in a Molecular Devices microplate reader. Absorbances were read against a standard curve prepared for each plate by serial dilutions of rat HL partly purified from liver heparin perfusates by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-heparin; HL activity was eluted from the column by a linear salt gradient and the peak fractions were pooled. After adding bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 1%, aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were incubated in methionine-free minimal essential medium in the absence or presence of inhibitors, as described above. After 1 h, 80 μCi of Tran35S-label was added per ml of cell suspension, and the incubation was continued for the time indicated. The incubations were stopped on ice, and the cells and media were separated by centrifugation (5 s, 10,000 ×g). The cell-free medium was collected in vials containing cold methionine (final concentration 1 mm) and the mixture of protease inhibitors described above. After washing twice with cold PBS, the cells were lysed in cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.25% SDS, 1 mm methionine, 25 units/ml heparin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and the mixture of protease inhibitors. After 30 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g and 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for further analysis. HL protein was immunoprecipitated from cell-free media and cell lysates by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of goat anti-HL IgGs immobilized onto Sepharose (13.Verhoeven A.J.M. Jansen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The beads were collected by centrifugation (20 s, 10,000 × g), and washed twice in successively: (i) 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, (ii) 1 m NaCl in PBS, and (iii) PBS (all containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For digestion with jack bean α-mannosidase (JBAM), the beads were resuspended in 100 μl of a 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 5 mm Zn2+, and then incubated overnight with or without 50 μg of JBAM. Thereafter, the immunoprecipitated proteins were released by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli's sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol, and the beads were removed by centrifugation. After treating with 2-mercaptoethanol, the released proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% gels. For digestion with Endo-H, the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 mmNaPi, pH 6.0, containing 0.5% SDS, and the proteins were released from the beads by boiling for 5 min. The eluate was diluted in 50 mm NaPi, pH 6.0, to reduce the concentration of SDS to 0.2%, and then incubated overnight at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 40 milliunits/ml of Endo-H. After addition of Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling for 5 min, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% gels. After SDS-PAGE, the gels were Coomassie-stained for estimation of molecular sizes. The 35S-labeled proteins were visualized, and their radioactivity quantified, by exposure of the dried gels to a phosphor screen (Bio-Rad GS-363 Molecular Imager System, Hercules, CA). Sensitivity to JBAM or Endo-H was indicated by an increase in electrophoretic mobility. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was taken as a measure for overall protein de novosynthesis. Incubations were performed as described above. Of the cell-free media and lysates, 5-μl aliquots were spotted in duplicate onto Whatman 3MM filters, and trichloroacetic acid precipitation was performed as described previously (19.Verhoeven A.J.M. Jansen H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1883-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity on the filters was measured using the Molecular Imager System. The duplicate measurements, which never differed by more than 5%, were averaged. The data were corrected for the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material in the media and lysates of a control cell suspension that was put on ice before addition of Tran35S-label. Hepatocytes were incubated for 3 h with heparin, and cell-free medium was prepared as described above. Cells were lysed in PBS containing 8 mmCHAPS, 25 units/ml heparin and the mixture of protease inhibitors. After 30 min on ice, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C). Of the secretion media and cleared lysates, 200-μl aliquots were layered on top of linear 5–20% (w/w) sucrose gradients (4.0 ml) in 2 mm MOPS buffer, pH 8.0, 4 mm CHAPS, and 25 units/ml heparin. The gradients were run at 40,000 rpm for 15 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW60 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Gradients were collected in 0.32-ml fractions by aspiration from the bottom of the tubes. Total recovery of HL activity from the sucrose gradients was 95 ± 10 and 135 ± 25% (means ± S.D., n = 5) for secretion media and cell lysates, respectively. The sedimentation markers bovine albumin (s20,w = 4.3 S) and rabbit IgG (s20,w = 7 S) were run in parallel; their position in the sucrose gradients was determined by Coomassie staining (32.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). All data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences were tested statistically by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test, and considered significant at p < 0.05 (33.Snedecor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. 7th Ed. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1980Google Scholar). When freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were incubated for 3 h in the presence of heparin, HL activity in the cell lysates remained almost constant at 4.3 ± 1.3 milliunits/ml (n = 6), which equals 0.27 ± 0.08 milliunits/106 cells. During this incubation, HL activity in the extracellular medium increased from 0.4 ± 0.1 to 9.1 ± 2.6 milliunits/ml, which corresponds to 2.3 ± 0.6 milliunits/106 cells. In the presence of increasing concentrations of CCCP, the extracellular appearance of HL activity gradually fell (Fig.1 A). Complete inhibition was obtained with 20 μm CCCP and above. Intracellular HL activity decreased to 63 ± 10% (n = 3) of controls when cells were incubated with 10 μm CCCP; a further increase in the CCCP concentration did not have an additional effect on intracellular HL activity. To study the effect of CCCP onde novo synthesis of HL protein, [35S]methionine was included during the last hour of incubation. Fig. 1 B shows that CCCP induced a dose-dependent reduction in the 35S radioactivity of HL protein immunoprecipitated from the media plus lysate (53 + 58 kDa bands; see below). This parallelled the effect of the inhibitor on incorporation of 35S radioactivity into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material, and hence on overall protein synthesis (not shown). With 20 μm CCCP and above, HL and overall protein synthesis were completely blocked. When incubated with CCCP up till 10 μm, [35S]HL in immunoprecipitates from the cell lysates was hardly affected, whereas [35S]HL in the extracellular media was highly sensitive to inhibition. With 10 μm CCCP, where HL synthesis was reduced by approximately 30%, the newly synthesized HL protein was no longer secreted into the extracellular medium but remained in the cells. Pulse-chase experiments were performed to study the effect of CCCP on maturation of newly synthesized HL protein. After a 5-min pulse with [35S]methionine, 35S-labeled HL migrated as a 53-kDa protein (Fig. 2). During the subsequent chase of control cells, the 53-kDa protein was converted into a 58-kDa protein with a half-life of approximately 20 min. Pulse labeling of cells that had been preincubated with 10 μmCCCP also resulted in a 35S-labeled HL protein with apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa. During the chase in the presence of CCCP, the 53-kDa HL protein matured into the 58-kDa form but at a much lower rate. The 58-kDa form appeared only after 30 min chase; approximately 50% of the 53-kDa form had matured into the 58-kDa form after 45 min of chase. The 53-kDa band was sensitive to digestion with Endo-H, whereas the 58-kDa band was Endo-H resistant (see below). Hence, CCCP retarded the maturation of the 53 kDa, high-mannose type precursor form into the 58-kDa complex-type form of HL. Taken together, the effects of CCCP on HL maturation and secretion are in agreement with its proposed action as inhibitor of the RER-to-Golgi transport. The effect of 10 μm CCCP on HL expression was compared with that of 100 μg/ml castanospermine, which inhibits RER-to-Golgi transport of N-glycoproteins by interfering with oligosaccharide processing. After 3 h of incubation, both HL activity and HL protein were reduced in the extracellular medium of CCCP-treated cells by approximately 85% compared with controls, whereas with castanospermine, both parameters were decreased in parallel by 65% (Table I). The specific enzyme activity of secreted HL was about 45 milliunits/μg, which was not significantly affected by either treatment. Under the conditions used, the specific enzyme activity of HL in the control cell lysates was only 50% of that in the cell-free media. Upon treating the cells with CCCP, the amount of intracellular HL protein was hardly affected, although simultaneously, HL activity decreased by approximately 35% (Table I). Hence, the specific enzyme activity of intracellular HL was 25% lower in CCCP-treated cells than in control cells. In the presence of CSP, both HL protein and HL activity in the cells were significantly reduced compared with controls, but the effect on HL activity was stronger than on HL protein. As a result, the specific enzyme activity of residual HL fell by approximately 50%. In parallel incubations, the effect of the inhibitors on overall protein de novosynthesis was determined. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was reduced to 52.5 ± 24.4 and 71.2 ± 8.1% of control by CCCP and CSP, respectively (n = 3).Table IEffect of castanospermine and CCCP on intracellular and extracellular HLHL activityHL proteinSpecific activityMilliunits/ml%Microgram/ml%Milliunits/μg%Cell-free media Control10.4 ± 1.91000.20 ± 0.0610042.8 ± 8.4100 CCCP1.4 ± 1.1aStatistically significant difference from control media (p < 0.05).140.03 ± 0.02aStatistically significant difference from control media (p < 0.05).1540.1 ± 15.494 CSP3.4 ± 0.6aStatistically significant difference from control media (p < 0.05).330.07 ± 0.02aStatistically significant difference from control media (p < 0.05).3744.5 ± 12.8104Cell lysates Control4.8 ± 2.11000.22 ± 0.0710023.1 ± 10.5100 CCCP3.0 ± 0.2bStatistically significant difference from control lysates (p < 0.05).630.21 ± 0.109417.7 ± 1.3bStatistically significant difference from control lysates (p < 0.05).76 CSP1.8 ± 0.5bStatistically significant difference from control lysates (p < 0.05).360.13 ± 0.04bStatistically significant difference from control lysates (p < 0.05).6110.9 ± 3.4bStatistically significant difference from control lysates (p < 0.05).47Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were incubated for 3 h in the presence of heparin without further additions (control), or with 10 μm CCCP or 100 μg/ml castanospermine (CSP).
