https://openalex.org/W2038195538,"Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination is crucial for cell proliferation and tumour suppression. However, despite its importance, the molecular intermediates of mitotic DSB repair remain undefined. The double Holliday junction (DHJ), presupposed to be the central intermediate for more than 25 years, has only been identified during meiotic recombination. Moreover, evidence has accumulated for alternative, DHJ-independent mechanisms, raising the possibility that DHJs are not formed during DSB repair in mitotically cycling cells. Here we identify intermediates of DSB repair by using a budding-yeast assay system designed to mimic physiological DSB repair. This system uses diploid cells and provides the possibility for allelic recombination either between sister chromatids or between homologues, as well as direct comparison with meiotic recombination at the same locus. In mitotically cycling cells, we detect inter-homologue joint molecule (JM) intermediates whose strand composition and size are identical to those of the canonical DHJ structures observed in meiosis. However, in contrast to meiosis, JMs between sister chromatids form in preference to those between homologues. Moreover, JMs seem to represent a minor pathway of DSB repair in mitotic cells, being detected at about tenfold lower levels (per DSB) than during meiotic recombination. Thus, although DHJs are identified as intermediates of DSB-promoted recombination in both mitotic and meiotic cells, their formation is distinctly regulated according to the specific dictates of the two cellular programs."

https://openalex.org/W1990372437,"Arabidopsis mutants containing gene disruptions in AHA1 and AHA2, the two most highly expressed isoforms of the Arabidopsis plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase family, have been isolated and characterized. Plants containing homozygous loss-of-function mutations in either gene grew normally under laboratory conditions. Transcriptome and mass spectrometric measurements demonstrate that lack of lethality in the single gene mutations is not associated with compensation by increases in RNA or protein levels. Selected reaction monitoring using synthetic heavy isotope-labeled C-terminal tryptic peptides as spiked standards with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer revealed increased levels of phosphorylation of a regulatory threonine residue in both isoforms in the mutants. Using an extracellular pH assay as a measure of in vivo ATPase activity in roots, less proton secreting activity was found in the aha2 mutant. Among 100 different growth conditions, those that decrease the membrane potential (high external potassium) or pH gradient (high external pH) caused a reduction in growth of the aha2 mutant compared with wild type. Despite the normal appearance of single mutants under ideal laboratory growth conditions, embryos containing homozygous double mutations are lethal, demonstrating that, as expected, this protein is absolutely essential for plant cell function. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the two genes together perform an essential function and that the effects of their single mutations are mostly masked by overlapping patterns of expression and redundant function as well as by compensation at the post-translational level."
https://openalex.org/W2163809120,"Cancer chemoprevention uses natural, synthetic, or biological substances to reverse, suppress, or prevent either the initial phase of carcinogenesis or the progression of neoplastic cells to cancer. It holds promise for overcoming problems associated with the treatment of late-stage cancers. However, the broad application of chemoprevention is compromised at present by limited effectiveness and potential toxicity. To overcome these challenges, here we developed a new chemoprevention approach that specifically targets premalignant tumour cells for apoptosis. We show that a deficiency in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and subsequent activation of beta-catenin lead to the repression of cellular caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP (also known as CFLAR) expression through activation of c-Myc, and that all-trans-retinyl acetate (RAc) independently upregulates tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) death receptors and suppresses decoy receptors. Thus, the combination of TRAIL and RAc induces apoptosis in APC-deficient premalignant cells without affecting normal cells in vitro. In addition, we show that short-term and non-continuous TRAIL and RAc treatment induce apoptosis specifically in intestinal polyps, strongly inhibit tumour growth, and prolong survival in multiple intestinal neoplasms C57BL/6J-Apc(Min)/J (Apc(Min)) mice. With our approach, we further demonstrate that TRAIL and RAc induce significant cell death in human colon polyps, providing a potentially selective approach for colorectal cancer chemoprevention by targeting APC-deficient cells for apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W1964694971,"The present work demonstrates the ability of CO to prevent apoptosis in a primary culture of astrocytes. For the first time, the antiapoptotic behavior can be clearly attributed to the inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP), a key event in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In isolated non-synaptic mitochondria, CO partially inhibits (i) loss of potential, (ii) the opening of a nonspecific pore through the inner membrane, (iii) swelling, and (iv) cytochrome c release, which are induced by calcium, diamide, or atractyloside (a ligand of ANT). CO directly modulates ANT function by enhancing ADP/ATP exchange and prevents its pore-forming activity. Additionally, CO induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and its prevention by beta-carotene decreases CO cytoprotection in intact cells as well as in isolated mitochondria, revealing the key role of ROS. On the other hand, CO induces a slight increase in mitochondrial oxidized glutathione, which is essential for apoptosis modulation by (i) delaying astrocytic apoptosis, (ii) decreasing MMP, and (iii) enhancing ADP/ATP translocation activity of ANT. Moreover, CO and GSSG trigger ANT glutathionylation, a post-translational process regulating protein function in response to redox cellular changes. In conclusion, CO protects astrocytes from apoptosis by preventing MMP, acting on ANT (glutathionylation and inhibition of its pore activity) via a preconditioning-like process mediated by ROS and GSSG."

Disruption of the gp130 receptor that modulates the balance of the SHP2/ERK and JAK/STAT pathways enhanced peptic ulceration and gastric cancer in gp130 knock-out mice. In this study, we evaluated the effect of translocated CagA in relation to its tyrosine phosphorylation status on the gp130-mediated signal switch between the SHP2/ERK and JAK/STAT3 pathways. We showed that in the presence of CagA, SHP2 was recruited to gp130. Phosphorylated CagA showed enhanced SHP2 binding activity and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas unphosphorylated CagA showed preferential STAT3 activation.

At least two functional modules of gp130 have been characterized; one encompasses four membrane-distal Tyr(P) binding sites for the Src homology 2 domain of the latent transcription factors, STAT1 and STAT3. The other comprises the membrane-proximal Tyr(P)757 residue responsible for the engagement of cytoplasmic SHP2 (26Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem.

That cellular factors that are up-regulated in response to H. pylori could modulate SHP2/ERK or JAK/STAT signaling pathways suggests that H. pylori persistence and its consequent pathologies could be influenced by gp130-mediated signal transduction through these pathways (30Wang T.C. Goldenring J.R. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1080-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation status in the activation of the SHP2/ERK and JAK/STAT pathways downstream of the gp130 receptor. Our studies indicate that the tyrosine phosphorylation status of CagA produced by H. pylori directs the traffic of signal transduction through the two pathways. A pair of naturally occurring isogenic cagA strains (147C, with a 3′ tyrosine phosphorylation motif, and 147A, without the motif) isolated simultaneously from the same host have been described (31Aras R.A.

As controls, H. pylori strains 60190 (cagPAI+), 8822 (cagPAI−), and ΔcagA (an isogenic mutant of 60190 lacking cagA (ATCC 49503) were used. H. pylori strains were cultured on agar plates containing 10% horse serum at 37 °C in a microaerobic atmosphere, using the Campy Container System (BBL, Sparks, MD). Human (AGS) gastric epithelial cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. On the day of experimentation, confluent cells were incubated overnight in fresh serum- and antibiotic-free media. AGS cells also were co-incubated with H. pylori up to multiplicities of infection of 100:1 for varying times. Whole cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Immunodetection was performed using an electrochemiluminescence reagent (Intron, Seoul, Korea), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In experiments using kinase inhibitors, cells were incubated with PP2 (Calbiochem), UO126 (Promega, Madison, WI), or AG490 (Calbiochem) for 1 h before co-incubation with H. pylori. Anti-SHP2, anti-pY99, anti-phospho-STAT3, anti-STAT3, anti-gp130, anti-phospho-JAK2, anti-JAK2, and anti-c-Myc were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz CA), anti-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), and anti-CagA antibody (HPP-5003-9) was from ASTRAL Biologicals (San Ramon, CA). Anti-human IL6R monoclonal neutralizing antibody and gp130 were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). AGS cells were cultured overnight with monoclonal antibodies to IL6R or gp130 (R&D Systems) in a serum-free medium and co-incubated with H. pylori at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Whole cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for anti-phospho-STAT3 antibody. Equal loading of lanes was controlled by comparison with lanes that had been resolved using anti-STAT3 antibody. For immunoprecipitation, whole cell extracts prepared with lysis buffer were incubated overnight with appropriate antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C, and immune complexes were trapped on protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were washed five times with cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates and immunoprecipitated materials were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with antibodies, including anti-SHP2, anti-CagA, or anti-gp130, and then visualized using a chemiluminescence reagent (Intron). SHP2-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) (kindly provided by Prof. M. Hatakeyama) was used to silence the expression of SHP2 (34Higuchi M. Tsutsumi R. Higashi H. Hatakeyama M. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To selectively knock down human SHP2 expression, AGS cells were co-transfected with pSUPER-SHP2 and pBabePuro. After 12 h, cells were incubated in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum containing 0.3 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) to select appropriate transfectants; SHP2 expression of the cloned cells was confirmed by immunoblotting. AGS cells co-incubated with H. pylori were washed twice with cold PBS, fixed in methanol for 10 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 30 min, followed by incubation with anti-phospho-STAT3 mouse monoclonal antibodies in 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, phospho-STAT3 was visualized by treatment with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse monoclonal secondary antibodies for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS, mounting medium for fluorescence was added, and slides were sealed with coverslips and examined for immunofluorescence using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). AGS cells co-cultured with H. pylori were harvested and separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions using CEB buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cytoplasmic fraction was clarified by centrifugation at 1,200 × g for 5 min, and the nuclear pellet was washed with CEB buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 to remove cytoplasmic contamination. The nuclear pellet was lysed with NEB buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Nuclear proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand complementary DNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total cellular RNA using an RNA PCR kit (Intron) with random primers. Thereafter, real time RT-PCR analysis also was performed using a PCR mixture containing 1 μmol/liter of each primer and SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the ABI PRISM 7000 Quantitative PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was examined in triplicate, and the amounts of the PCR products produced were normalized with respect to β-actin, as an internal control. The following primer pairs were used: c-myc, 5′-TGC TCC ATG AGG AGA CAC C and 5′-CTC TGA CCT TTT GCC AGG AG; β-actin, 5′-TTG CCG ACA GGA TGC AGA AGA and 5′-AGG TGG ACA GCG AGG CCA GGA T. AGS cells co-incubated with H. pylori were harvested and separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions using CEB buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor, as described above. The oligonucleotides used as probes for the EMSA were as follows: c-myc E2F, 5′-GACGCTTGGCGGGAAAAAG and 5′-GGCTTTTTCCCGCCAAG (35Chaturvedi P. Sharma S. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3295-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides based on c-myc E2F were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). For binding reactions, 1 × 105 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide probes were incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extracts and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (4% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at room temperature for 20 min. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis in a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. The gels were dried and exposed to film (Agfa) at −70° using an intensifying screen. Cell migration assays were performed using μ-Dish 35-mm culture inserts (Ibidi) according to the manufacturer's protocols. In brief, AGS cells were seeded into each well of culture inserts and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. On the day of experimentation, confluent cells were refed overnight with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% FBS. After appropriate cell attachment, the culture inserts were gently removed by using sterile tweezers, and the dish was filled with fresh RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% FBS. AGS cells also were co-incubated for 24 h with H. pylori to a multiplicity of infection of 50. Significance in differences between experimental conditions was determined by Student's t test; p values of <0.05 were considered significant in all analyses. The tyrosine phosphorylation status of CagA has been shown to strongly influence CagA binding affinity to SHP2 (23Higashi H. Nakaya A. Tsutsumi R. Yokoyama K. Fujii Y. Ishikawa S. Higuchi M.

We began our experiments by asking whether the H. pylori strains that we were studying would show similar activities. As expected, both of the H. pylori strains (147C and 60190) that express CagA and that have tyrosine phosphorylation sites in their EPIYA domain (C-EPIYA+) showed CagA binding to SHP2, whereas the CagA PAI-negative 8822 and ΔcagA strains showed no detectable SHP2 binding (Fig. 1A). Differences in the mobility of the CagA protein reflect the previously observed microheterogeneity in the cagA open reading frame (31Aras R.A. Lee Y. Kim S.K. Israel D. Peek Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 188: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Kim S.Y. Lee Y.C. Kim H.K. Blaser M.J. Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results confirm that the CagA molecules we study bind to SHP2, as determined by tyrosine phosphorylation status. SHP2 activation is critical for IL6 induction of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (34Higuchi M. Tsutsumi R. Higashi H. Hatakeyama M.

To examine whether H. pylori affects SHP2 recruitment to gp130, a central constituent of the IL6 receptor complex (37Bode J.G. Schweigart J. Kehrmann J. Ehlting C. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C.

For AGS cells co-incubated with C-EPIYA+ H. pylori strain 147C or 60190, immunoprecipitation showed that SHP2 was associated with both gp130 and with CagA. However, no association with gp130 was detected in the AGS cells that were co-incubated with C-EPIYA− H. pylori strain 147A or cagA− strain 8822 (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that the injected phosphorylated C-EPIYA+ CagA plays a role in the recruitment of SHP2 to gp130. Next we compared the isogenic cagA+ isogenic C-EPIYA− 147A and C-EPIYA+ 147C H. pylori strains by co-incubating them with AGS cells to determine whether the AGS cell gp130 receptors become activated. After co-incubation, the AGS cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-gp130 antibodies. Both of the H. pylori strains induced activation of the gp130 receptor, indicating its independence from CagA tyrosine phosphorylation status. Once it became clear that the H. pylori strains we studied activated gp130, confirming the results of Bronte-Tinkew et al. (39Bronte-Tinkew D.M. Terebiznik M. Franco A. Ang M. Ahn D. Mimuro H. Sasakawa C. Ropeleski M.J. Peek Jr., R.M. Jones N.L. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we next examined the downstream JAK/STAT activation. First, to analyze STAT3 activation in relation to the CagA tyrosine phosphorylation status, AGS cells were co-incubated for 3 or 6 h with H. pylori strains of varying cagA genotype and then immunoblotted using anti-phospho-STAT3. STAT3 was phosphorylated in AGS cells that were co-incubated with C-EPIYA− strain 147A (Fig. 2B), but compared with the absence of H. pylori (control), essentially no phosphorylation was observed with two C-EPIYA+ strains (147C and 60190) or with strain 8822. Following cytokine stimulation, STAT3 is activated by the phosphorylation of a single tyrosine residue (Tyr705) by JAK2 and dimerizes via a reciprocal Src homology 2 phosphotyrosine interaction (40Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). To examine whether the H. pylori STAT3 phosphorylation is mediated by JAK2 activation, AGS cells were co-incubated with H. pylori strains. We found that C-EPIYA− strain 147A induced JAK2 activation, which suggests that the STAT3 activation mediated by non-phosphorylated CagA is dependent on JAK2 activation (Fig. 2C). To address that hypothesis, because CagA is phosphorylated by the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (15Odenbreit S. Püls J. Sedlmaier B. Gerland E. Fischer W. Haas R.

AGS gastric epithelial cells were pretreated with PP2 for 1 h prior to co-incubation, and STAT3 activation was examined. In the presence of PP2, STAT activation by C-EPIYA+ strains 147C and 60190 was observed (Fig. 2D). That PP2 inhibition of Src kinase (thus inhibiting CagA phosphorylation) restores STAT3 activation provides further evidence that non-phosphorylated CagA is essential for the observed (39Bronte-Tinkew D.M. Terebiznik M. Franco A. Ang M. Ahn D. Mimuro H. Sasakawa C. Ropeleski M.J. Peek Jr., R.M. Jones N.L.

The IL6 receptor complex is composed of a ligand-binding receptor (IL6R) and its signal transducer, gp130 (41Chatterjee M. Hönemann D. Lentzsch S. Bommert K. Sers C. Herrmann P. Mathas S. Dörken B. Bargou R.C. Blood. 2002; 100: 3311-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to IL6R and gp130, that function as specific receptor antagonists, abrogating activation of the IL6/IL6R/gp130 complex (42Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), were used to examine whether H. pylori-induced STAT3 activation in AGS cells is mediated through the gp130 receptor. AGS cells were preincubated overnight with the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to IL6R and gp130 in serum-free medium and then co-incubated with H. pylori. We found that the antibody treatment substantially inhibited the STAT3 activation in AGS cells that had been induced by strain 147A, which indicated that the predominant signal by its C-EPIYA− CagA involves the gp130 receptor (Fig. 3A). Next, to determine whether the C-EPIYA− CagA-induced STAT3 phosphorylation is mediated via JAK2, AGS cells were pretreated with AG490, a JAK2-preferential JAK inhibitor, and then co-incubated with H. pylori (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the addition of AG490 had no effect on the viability of the cells (data not shown). AGS cells pretreated with AG490 showed greatly reduced 147A-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation. In total, these results showed that both gp130 and JAK2 activation are involved in the C-EPIYA− CagA-induced STAT3 activation. The gp130 receptor is responsible for engagement of cytoplasmic SHP2 and subsequent activation of the Ras-ERK pathway (26Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar, 27Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). To investigate whether CagA C-EPIYA status affects the SHP2/ERK pathway downstream of the gp130 receptor, AGS cells were co-incubated with the defined H. pylori strains. As expected, SHP2 was phosphorylated in cells that were co-incubated with C-EPIYA+ 147C or 60190 and not with C-EPIYA− 147C or with cagA− 8822 (Fig. 4A). There was early ERK activation by both 147A and 147C, but activation was more sustained for 147C (Fig. 4B). In the absence of H. pylori, AGS control cells showed no detectable levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2. Together with our prior studies (33Pillinger M.H. Marjanovic N. Kim S.Y. Lee Y.C. Scher J.U. Roper J. Abeles A.M. Izmirly P.I. Axelrod M. Pillinger M.Y. Tolani S. Dinsell V. Abramson S.B. Blaser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18722-18731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), these data confirm that C-EPIYA+ CagA facilitates signal transduction through SHP2/ERK to a greater extent than does C-EPIYA− CagA. To determine why C-EPIYA+ CagA does not induce STAT3 activation and because SHP2 is known to be an important negative regulator of JAK2/STAT3 signaling in other cells (42Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), we next investigated the specific involvement of SHP2 in JAK2/STAT3 activation in AGS cells co-incubated with H. pylori. SHP2 activity correlates with its own phosphorylation, which can catalyze tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs, receptors, or other cellular proteins (41Chatterjee M. Hönemann D. Lentzsch S. Bommert K. Sers C. Herrmann P. Mathas S. Dörken B. Bargou R.C. Blood. 2002; 100: 3311-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because we showed that C-EPIYA+ strain 147C phosphorylates SHP2 in AGS cells (Fig. 4A), but JAK2 is not activated (Fig. 2C), and because the SHP2 recruitment site within gp130 often is involved in negative regulation of IL6-induced STAT3 activation (43Symes A.

As expected, treatment with SHP2 siRNA substantially lowered SHP2 levels (Fig. 4C). In AGS cells that were co-incubated with C-EPIYA− 147A, STAT3 activation was not affected by the SHP2 siRNA pretreatment. In contrast, siRNA pretreatment of AGS cells co-incubated with C-EPIYA+ 147C increased JAK2 and STAT3. These studies provide further evidence that phosphorylated SHP2 inhibits JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways after its interaction with C-EPIYA+ CagA molecules. Thus, phosphorylation-competent (C-EPIYA+) and incompetent (C-EPIYA−) forms of CagA have opposing cellular functions. ERK kinase activity also can down-regulate STAT3 function via several mechanisms, including inhibition of upstream kinases, such as JAK family members (45Sengupta T.K. Talbot E.S. Scherle P.A.

https://openalex.org/W1992331666,"Pathogenic generation of the 42-amino acid variant of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) by beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is believed to be causative for Alzheimer disease (AD). Lowering of Abeta(42) production by gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) is a hopeful approach toward AD treatment. The mechanism of GSM action is not fully understood. Moreover, whether GSMs target the Abeta domain is controversial. To further our understanding of the mode of action of GSMs and the cleavage mechanism of gamma-secretase, we analyzed mutations located at different positions of the APP transmembrane domain around or within the Abeta domain regarding their response to GSMs. We found that Abeta(42)-increasing familial AD mutations of the gamma-secretase cleavage site domain responded robustly to Abeta(42)-lowering GSMs, especially to the potent compound GSM-1, irrespective of the amount of Abeta(42) produced. We thus expect that familial AD patients carrying mutations at the gamma-secretase cleavage sites of APP should respond to GSM-based therapeutic approaches. Systematic phenylalanine-scanning mutagenesis of this region revealed a high permissiveness to GSM-1 and demonstrated a complex mechanism of GSM action as other Abeta species (Abeta(41), Abeta(39)) could also be lowered besides Abeta(42). Moreover, certain mutations simultaneously increased Abeta(42) and the shorter peptide Abeta(38), arguing that the proposed precursor-product relationship of these Abeta species is not general. Finally, mutations of residues in the proposed GSM-binding site implicated in Abeta(42) generation (Gly-29, Gly-33) and potentially in GSM-binding (Lys-28) were also responsive to GSMs, a finding that may question APP substrate targeting of GSMs."

The extent to which other members of the PDI family are oxidized by Ero1 and thus contribute to net disulfide formation in the ER has been an open question. The yeast ER contains four PDI family proteins with at least one potential redox-active cysteine pair. We monitored the direct oxidation of each redox-active site in these proteins by yeast Ero1p in vitro. In this study, we found that the Pdi1p amino-terminal domain was oxidized most rapidly compared with the other oxidoreductase active sites tested, including the Pdi1p carboxyl-terminal domain. This observation is consistent with experiments conducted in yeast cells. In particular, the amino-terminal domain of Pdi1p preferentially formed mixed disulfides with Ero1p in vivo, and we observed synthetic lethality between a temperature-sensitive Ero1p variant and mutant Pdi1p lacking the amino-terminal active-site disulfide. Thus, the amino-terminal domain of yeast Pdi1p is on a preferred pathway for oxidizing the ER thiol pool. Overall, our results provide a rank order for the tendency of yeast ER oxidoreductases to acquire disulfides from Ero1p."

Defining the extracellular mediators and the intracellular signaling pathways regulating those dynamic processes is a key step in developing restitution-targeted therapies. Previously we have determined that activation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by the cognate ligand CXCL12 enhances intestinal epithelial restitution through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The aim of these studies was to investigate the role of calcium effectors in CXCL12-mediated restitution. CXCL12 stimulated release of intracellular calcium in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of intracellular calcium flux impaired CXCL12-mediated migration of IEC-6 and CaCo2 cells. Pharmacological blockade and specific shRNA depletion of the phospholipase-C (PLCbeta3) isoform attenuated CXCL12-enhanced migration, linking receptor activation with intracellular calcium flux. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated CXCL12 activated the calcium-regulated focal adhesion protein proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2 (Pyk2) and the effector proteins paxillin and p130(Cas). Interruption of Pyk2 signaling potently blocked CXCL12-induced wound closure. CXCL12-stimulated epithelial cell migration was enhanced on laminin and abrogated by intracellular calcium chelation. These results suggest CXCL12 regulates restitution through calcium-activated Pyk2 localized to active focal adhesions. Calcium signaling pathways may therefore provide a novel avenue for enhancing barrier repair."

The structure resolution of glycoprotein gB has revealed the presence of fusogenic domains in this protein and pointed out the key role of gB in the entry mechanism of HSV-1. A second putative fusogenic glycoprotein is represented by the heterodimer comprising the membrane-anchored glycoprotein H (gH) and the small secreted glycoprotein L, which remains on the viral envelope in virtue of its non-covalent interaction with gH. Different domains scattered on the ectodomain of HSV-1 gH have been demonstrated to display membranotropic characteristics. The segment from amino acid 626 to 644 represents the most fusogenic region identified by studies with synthetic peptides and model membranes. Herein we have identified the minimal fusogenic sequence present on gH. An enlongation at the N terminus of a single histidine (His) has proved to profoundly increase the fusogenic activity of the original sequence. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies have shown that the addition of the N-terminal His contributes to the formation and stabilization of an alpha-helical domain with high fusion propensity."

The Drosophila peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-LE functions as an important host pattern recognition receptor against intracellular bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes. One PGRP-LE-mediated intracellular response against L. monocytogenes infection is the induction of autophagy, a conserved intracellular degradation system. Here, to further elucidate PGRP-LE-mediated intracellular innate immune responses, we performed a strategic microarray analysis and identified the Listericin gene, whose expression is induced in response to L. monocytogenes infection in a PGRP-LE-dependent manner. RNA interference and overexpression experiments demonstrated that Listericin gene induction is cooperatively regulated by PGRP-LE and the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway. An in vitro cell culture assay showed that Listericin is secreted as processed forms and suppresses the growth of L. monocytogenes and Gram-negative bacteria. A colony formation unit assay clearly demonstrated that induction of the Listericin gene suppresses not only the growth of L. monocytogenes but also the growth of Gram-negative bacteria in vivo. Based on these findings, we propose that the Listericin gene encodes a novel antibacterial peptide-like protein whose induction is cooperatively regulated by PGRP-LE and the JAK-STAT pathway. Intracellular bacteria cause serious infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, shigellosis, and listeriosis. The Drosophila peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-LE functions as an important host pattern recognition receptor against intracellular bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes. One PGRP-LE-mediated intracellular response against L. monocytogenes infection is the induction of autophagy, a conserved intracellular degradation system. Here, to further elucidate PGRP-LE-mediated intracellular innate immune responses, we performed a strategic microarray analysis and identified the Listericin gene, whose expression is induced in response to L. monocytogenes infection in a PGRP-LE-dependent manner. RNA interference and overexpression experiments demonstrated that Listericin gene induction is cooperatively regulated by PGRP-LE and the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway. An in vitro cell culture assay showed that Listericin is secreted as processed forms and suppresses the growth of L. monocytogenes and Gram-negative bacteria. A colony formation unit assay clearly demonstrated that induction of the Listericin gene suppresses not only the growth of L. monocytogenes but also the growth of Gram-negative bacteria in vivo. Based on these findings, we propose that the Listericin gene encodes a novel antibacterial peptide-like protein whose induction is cooperatively regulated by PGRP-LE and the JAK-STAT pathway. Intracellular pathogens cause infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and malaria, which have high worldwide morbidity and mortality rates. These intracellular pathogens survive in the host cells by manipulating basic host processes or immune systems to establish their own intracellular niche (1Alonso A. García-del Portillo F. Int. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 181-191PubMed Google Scholar). Listeria monocytogenes, one of the best studied facultative intracellular Gram-positive bacteria, causes the serious food-borne disease listeriosis, which affects mainly immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and neonates (2Vázquez-Boland J.A.

Upon entry into either phagocytotic or non-phagocytotic cells, L. monocytogenes secrete a cholesterol-dependent pore-forming cytotoxin, listeriolysin O, that disrupts the phagosome membrane and allows the bacteria to escape from vacuoles and proliferate in the cytosol (6Gedde M.M.

Cytosolic L. monocytogenes express an actin-nucleating protein, ActA, that facilitates host actin polymerization to form a scaffold that allows the bacteria to move into the cytosol and spread to neighboring cells (9Cossart P. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although several microbiologists have identified the key pathogenic factors in this multistep process of L. monocytogenes infection (3Hamon M. Bierne H. Cossart P. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 10Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. J. Pathol. 2006; 208: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanisms in terms of host defense systems remain unclear. Drosophila is an excellent model system to decipher the precise molecular mechanisms of host innate immune responses to microbial infections due to the availability of powerful genetic techniques combined with molecular and biochemical approaches and RNA interference (RNAi) tools that can be used in these organisms (11Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 12Ferrandon D. Imler J.L. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In addition to the practical experimental advantages, high conservation of pathogen recognition, signaling pathways, and effector mechanisms between Drosophila and mammals (13Janeway C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Nat.

Upon microbial infection, Drosophila recognize pathogens with germ line-encoded pattern recognition receptors that are highly conserved from insects to animals (12Ferrandon D. Imler J.L. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 13Janeway C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

The Toll pathway is mainly activated by fungal and lysine-type PGN-containing Gram-positive bacterial infection and activates the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors Dorsal and Dif (Dorsal-related immunity factor), whereas the imd pathway is predominantly activated by diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type PGN-containing bacteria (mainly Gram-negative bacteria) and activates the NF-κB homolog Relish (11Hoffmann J.A.

Subsequently, these activated NF-κB factors drive numerous effector genes, including the expression of seven distinct types of antimicrobial peptides (AMP; e.g. Attacin, Cecropin, Defensin, Diptericin, Drosocin, Drosomycin, and Metchnikowin), which are effective against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and fungi (19Tzou P.

Nevertheless, how L. monocytogenes are recognized by pattern recognition receptors and how they are eliminated in the host cell cytosol remains unknown. In addition to the extracellular and intracellular functions of PGRP-LE to induce AMP after recognizing DAP-type PGN (18Kaneko T. Yano T. Aggarwal K. Lim J.H. Ueda K. Oshima Y. Peach C.

Yoshimori T. Kurata S. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated a novel role of PGRP-LE as an intracellular receptor against L. monocytogenes with a DAP-type PGN. Survival experiments indicate that PGRP-LE mutant flies die rapidly after L. monocytogenes infection. Consistently, the data from an in vitro cell culture also support findings from in vivo studies that intracellular growth of L. monocytogenes is much higher in Drosophila S2 cells without PGRP-LE expression than in S2 cells with PGRP-LE expression (34Yano T. Mita S. Ohmori H. Oshima Y. Fujimoto Y. Ueda R. Takada H. Goldman W.E. Fukase K. Silverman N. Yoshimori T. Kurata S. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Moreover, PGRP-LE has a crucial role inducing autophagy, which is a highly conserved cellular process involved in lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic components. This infection-induced autophagy occurs independently of the Toll and imd pathways and directly promotes host survival, providing other avenues of intracellular innate immunity (34Yano T. Mita S. Ohmori H. Oshima Y. Fujimoto Y. Ueda R. Takada H. Goldman W.E. Fukase K. Silverman N. Yoshimori T. Kurata S. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The present study aimed to obtain more details about the PGRP-LE-mediated host innate immune responses against L. monocytogenes infection. Based on strategic microarray analyses of different L. monocytogenes infection combinations, either in the absence or presence of PGRP-LE, and comparison of those data with those of different Gram-positive and -negative bacteria injected into adult flies, we identified CG9080 (referred to here as the Listericin gene) as a previously uncharacterized gene that is induced in response to L. monocytogenes infection in a PGRP-LE-dependent manner. Functional RNAi and overexpression studies demonstrated that Listericin gene induction depends on both PGRP-LE and the JAK-STAT pathway. Further biochemical and in vivo overexpression studies revealed that Listericin is secreted and is capable of suppressing the growth of L. monocytogenes as well as Gram-negative bacteria in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the Listericin gene encodes a novel AMP-like protein whose induction is cooperatively regulated by PGRP-LE and the JAK-STAT pathway. 7.5 × 105 Drosophila S2 cells or metallothionein promoter-PGRP-LE-expressing S2 cells (Inducible-LE (Ind-LE)) (34Yano T. Mita S. Ohmori H. Oshima Y. Fujimoto Y. Ueda R. Takada H. Goldman W.E. Fukase K. Silverman N. Yoshimori T. Kurata S. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) per well were seeded in 24-well plates. After 30 min of 50-μm water-soluble cholesterol treatment, a suspension of L. monocytogenes (approximately ∼40 bacteria/cell unless otherwise described) or heat-killed Escherichia coli was added, and immune stimulation continued for 1.5 h at 28 °C. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, reseeded onto new plates, and incubated for 8 h in Drosophila Schneider's medium containing 100 μm CuSO4 and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Infection conditions for the preparation of microarray samples using S2 cells and S2* cells stably expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged PGRP-LE induced by an actin-promoter (YFP-LE cells) (18Kaneko T. Yano T. Aggarwal K. Lim J.H. Ueda K. Oshima Y. Peach C. Erturk-Hasdemir D. Goldman W.E. Oh B.H. Kurata S. Silverman N. Nat.

Fukase K. Silverman N. Yoshimori T. Kurata S. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Total RNA from S2 cells and Drosophila adult flies homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen) was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The RNA quality was checked using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Total RNA (1 μg) was amplified and labeled as complementary RNA (cRNA) using an IVT labeling kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 arrays were hybridized with 30 μg of labeled cRNA, washed, stained, and scanned. All microarray procedures were performed according to the Affymetrix protocol. Two independent experiments were performed for each duplicated condition of S2 cells and various bacteria-injected flies (supplemental Fig. 1). These samples allowed for four comparisons, infected versus control samples (supplemental Fig. 1). Changes in expression are shown as the signal log ratio. The most widely used alternative transformation of the ratio is the logarithm base 2, which has the advantage of producing a continuous spectrum of values and treating up- and down-regulated genes similarly (35Quackenbush J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). It is important to remember that logarithms treat numbers and their reciprocals symmetrically: log2(1) = 0, log2(2) = 1 log2(1/2) = −1, log2(4) = 2, log2(1/4) = −2, and so on. Raw data of all processed microarray analyses are available at the Drosophila Microarray Database website at Tohoku University. Cells (1.5 × 106/ml) were transfected in 24-well plates using a calcium phosphate precipitation kit (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of either a Upd-GFP (36Harrison D.A. McCoon P.E. Binari R. Gilman M. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3252-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), PGRP-LC (37Goto A. Matsushita K. Gesellchen V. El Chamy L. Kuttenkeuler D. Takeuchi O. Hoffmann J.A. Akira S.

Immunol. 2002; 3: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) expression vector for overexpression and 1 μg of either dsGFP, dsKey, dsDif, dsdorsal, or dsStat92E for RNAi analysis. After 18 h of transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for another 24 h, and used for L. monocytogenes infection. To make double-stranded RNAs, single-stranded RNAs were synthesized with the T7 RNA polymerase (Novagen, Madison, WI). Annealed double-stranded RNAs were precipitated in ethanol and dissolved in injection buffer (0.1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 5 mm KCl) (39Goto A. Blandin S. Royet J. Reichhart J.M. Levashina E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6619-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To establish stable S2 cell lines expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), which were used as a negative control, and with or without C-terminal V5-HIS-tagged Listericin, cDNA fragments were amplified using the following primers: forward (5′-CCC GGG GAA TTC GAT AAT TCC CGC CAT GAG TAA AGG AGA AGA AC-3′) and reverse (5′-CCC GGG CTC GAG TTA TTT GTA TAG TTC ATC CAT G-3′) for GFP; forward (5′-CCC GGG GAA TTC GAT AAT TCC CGC CAT GAA ACA GTA CCT GGT GC-3′) and reverse (5′-CCC GGG CTC GAG TTT ACG TCC CCA ACT GGA ACT G-3′) for Listericin-V5-HIS, and forward (5′-CCC GGG GAA TTC GAT AAT TCC CGC CAT GAA ACA GTA CCT GGT GC-3′) and reverse (5′-CCC GGG CTC GAG TTA TTT ACG TCC CCA ACT GGA ACT G-3′) for Listericin without tags and subcloned into EcoRI-XhoI sites of the pAC5.1-V5-HIS vector (Invitrogen). These vectors were transfected together with pCoHygro for GFP and Listericin-V5-HIS and pCoBlast for mock vector (pAC5.1 vector only), and Listericin without tags and stable transfected cells were selected with Hygromycin B or Blasticidin S according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated from each genotype of ∼20 flies or S2 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 μg) was used for cDNA synthesis with ReverTraAce reverse transcriptase (Toyobo, Osaka) and oligo(dT)15 primer (Promega). Using the first-strand cDNA (0.5 μl), real-time PCR was performed using a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics). Primers used for semiquantitative RT-PCR and real-time PCR are described in supplemental Table 1. Flies were grown on standard medium at 25 °C. All other strains used have been published as follows: UAS-GFP and Collagen (Cg)-Gal4 (40Asha H. Nagy I. Kovacs G. Stetson D. Ando I. Dearolf C.R. Genetics. 2003; 163: 203-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A PCR fragment of the Listericin gene without tags was amplified with the same primers to make the stable cell lines described above and subcloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of the pUAST vector. Transgenic UAS-Listericin flies were obtained by standard embryo microinjection of the pUAST-Listericin vector in the w118 strain. After 3 to 4 days of culture in conditioned medium, Listericin-V5-HIS expressing or non-expressing cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a Hybond-P polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (GE Healthcare), and reacted with anti-V5 epitope antibody (Invitrogen). The same amount of proteins used for immunoblot analysis was visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. Flies 3–5 days after eclosion were infected with a ∼69-nl injection of L. monocytogenes suspension per fly. The optical density at 600 nm for the wild-type (10403S) and Δhly L. monocytogenes (DP-L2161) (8Cheng L.W. Portnoy D.A. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suspension was 0.00001 (∼10 bacteria/fly) or 0.001 (∼1000 bacteria/fly). All survival experiments were performed using 30 flies of each genotype at 28 °C. Surviving flies were counted daily by transferring them to fresh vials. The following pathogens were used for infection: E. coli (K-12), Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15 (Ecc15), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC10801, wood46), and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (GTC0205). A total of 400 ml of 5–6-day cultured conditioned medium from Listericin-V5-HIS-expressing cells in serum-free SFX insect medium (HyClone) was first dialyzed in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, overnight, and then the pH was shifted to 8.0 for 6 h. The dialyzed medium containing 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and an appropriate concentration of protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Diagnostics) was subjected to affinity chromatography on a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose bead column (Qiagen) at 4 °C, washed, and eluted with 0.25 m imidazole. Eluted fractions were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed in cold acetone, and dissolved in SDS sample buffer. The samples were applied to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the CBB-stained band detected in immunoblot analysis using anti-V5 epitope antibody was analyzed by Edman degradation protein sequencing (HiPep Laboratories). For in vitro cell culture assay, conditioned medium collected from cells expressing S2-GFP (used as control) or S2-Listericin cultured for 3–4 days was mixed with the appropriate number of L. monocytogenes, E. coli, or S. saprophyticus cells diluted serially after 0, 1, or 2 h at 29 °C for L. monocytogenes and at 37 °C for E. coli and S. saprophyticus and plated onto the appropriate plates. For the in vivo assays, 24 h after a ∼70-nl injection of each bacterial strain, the flies were collected and sterilized with 70% ethanol. A total of 10 flies of each genotype were homogenized in 500 μl of the appropriate bacterial medium, serially diluted, and plated onto the appropriate plates (brain heart infusion medium for L. monocytogenes; Luria Bertani medium for E. coli and Ecc15; nutrient broth medium for S. aureus and S. saprophyticus). The next day, colony numbers were counted to calculate the CFU per ml or per fly. The optical density at 600 nm for each injected bacterial suspension was as follows: L. monocytogenes (0.0001), S. aureus (0.0001), E. coli (1.0), and Ecc15 (1.0). To identify uncharacterized PGRP-LE-dependent host defense genes against L. monocytogenes infection, we performed a strategic microarray analysis for four different combinations of infections (Fig. 1A). We used normal S2 cells and YFP-LE cells (YFP-tagged PGRP-LE-expressing cells) as representative PGRP-LE absent or present host cells, respectively, and infected them with a cytoplasm non-escapable Δhly mutant lacking listeriolysin O or escapable wild-type L. monocytogenes strains. Microarray analysis identified 68 candidate genes that were specifically induced with an at least a 5-fold up-regulation upon wild-type L. monocytogenes infection of YFP-LE cells (supplemental Fig. 2; see the Drosophila Microarray Database web site). To further identify innate factors common between in vitro and in vivo infection, we performed other rounds of microarray analysis of adult flies injected with bacteria in vivo. Both wild-type and Δhly L. monocytogenes as well as other Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, S. aureus, and Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria were injected into adult flies, and whole gene expression profiles were analyzed by microarray analysis (see the Drosophila Microarray Database web site). Analysis of all microarray data from adult flies and comparison with the 68 candidate genes from the in vitro S2 assay led to the identification of a previously uncharacterized gene, CG9080 (named the Listericin), that was predominantly induced upon wild-type L. monocytogenes infection in only YFP-LE cells (Fig. 1B). To further confirm the microarray results, we verified Listericin gene expression at different multiplicities of infection (bacteria:host = 16:1, 40:1) with real-time RT-PCR analysis. The results clearly indicated that the Listericin gene is predominantly induced by infection by wild-type, but not Δhly, L. monocytogenes of YFP-LE, but not S2, cells (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the Listericin gene is induced in response to cytoplasmic infection by L. monocytogenes in a PGRP-LE-dependent manner. PGRP-LE acts as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor against DAP-type PGN and L. monocytogenes to induce AMPs such as Diptericin and Attacin and autophagy in an imd pathway-dependent and -independent manner, respectively (18Kaneko T. Yano T. Aggarwal K. Lim J.H. Ueda K. Oshima Y. Peach C. Erturk-Hasdemir D. Goldman W.E. Oh B.H. Kurata S. Silverman N. Nat.

We targeted three major innate immune signaling pathways, imd, Toll, and JAK-STAT, by RNAi targeting of the critical components of each pathway; inhibitor of NF-κB γ homologue key (41Rutschmann S.

Here we show that the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG bind to the C terminus of ABCA1 by a PDZ-PDZ interaction and prevent ABCA1 protein degradation by activating RhoA. ABCA1 is a protein with a short half-life, and apoA-I stabilizes ABCA1 protein; however, depletion of PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG by RNA interference suppressed the apoA-I stabilization of ABCA1 protein in human primary fibroblasts. Exogenous PDZ-RhoGEF expression activated RhoA and increased ABCA1 protein levels and cholesterol efflux activity. Likewise, forced expression of a constitutively active RhoA mutant significantly increased ABCA1 protein levels, whereas a dominant negative RhoA mutant decreased them. The constitutively active RhoA retarded ABCA1 degradation, thus accounting for its ability to increase ABCA1 protein. Moreover, stimulation with apoA-I transiently activated RhoA, and the pharmacological inhibition of RhoA or the dominant negative RhoA blocked the ability of apoA-I to stabilize ABCA1. Finally, depletion of RhoA or RhoGEFs/RhoA reduces the cholesterol efflux when transcriptional regulation via PPARγ is eliminated. Taken together, our results have identified a novel physical and functional interaction between ABCA1 and PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG, which activates RhoA, resulting in ABCA1 stabilization and cholesterol efflux activity.

https://openalex.org/W2022704390,"Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by alpha-secretase prevents formation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), which is the main constituent of amyloid plaques in brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. alpha-Secretase activity is decreased in AD, and overexpression of the alpha-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) in an AD animal model prevents amyloid pathology. ADAM10 has a 444-nucleotide-long, very GC-rich 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) with two upstream open reading frames. Because similar properties of 5'-UTRs are found in transcripts of many genes, which are regulated by translational control mechanisms, we asked whether ADAM10 expression is translationally controlled by its 5'-UTR. We demonstrate that the 5'-UTR of ADAM10 represses the rate of ADAM10 translation. In the absence of the 5'-UTR, we observed a significant increase of ADAM10 protein levels in HEK293 cells, whereas mRNA levels were not changed. Moreover, the 5'-UTR of ADAM10 inhibits translation of a luciferase reporter in an in vitro transcription/translation assay. Successive deletion of the first half of the ADAM10 5'-UTR revealed a striking increase in ADAM10 protein expression in HEK293 cells, suggesting that this part of the 5'-UTR contains inhibitory elements for translation. Moreover, we detect an enhanced alpha-secretase activity and consequently reduced Abeta levels in the conditioned medium of HEK293 cells expressing both amyloid precursor protein and a 5'-UTR-ADAM10 deletion construct lacking the first half of the 5'-UTR. Thus, we provide evidence that the 5'-UTR of ADAM10 may have an important role for post-transcriptional regulation of ADAM10 expression and consequently Abeta production."

In the present study we demonstrate that spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations occur in immature human monocyte-derived dendritic cells but not in dendritic cells stimulated to undergo maturation with lipopolysaccharide or other toll like-receptor agonists. We investigated the mechanism and role of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in immature dendritic cells and found that they are mediated by the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor as they were blocked by pretreatment of cells with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor antagonist Xestospongin C and 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate. A component of the Ca2+ signal is also due to influx from the extracellular environment and may be involved in maintaining the level of the intracellular Ca2+ stores. As to their biological role, our results indicate that they are intimately linked to the “immature” phenotype and are associated with the translocation of the transcription factor NFAT into the nucleus. In fact, once the Ca2+ oscillations are blocked with 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate or by treating the cells with lipopolysaccharide, NFAT remains cytoplasmic.

Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12349) Google Scholar). In general, DCs exist in two forms, immature DCs (iDC) and mature DCs. Immature DCs are extremely efficient at endocytosis; they reside in the peripheral tissues and continuously sample their environment for the presence of foreign antigens. After capturing antigens, they become activated and migrate to the lymphoid tissues and in the process lose the ability to take up new antigens, increase their surface expression of major histocompatibility complex II molecules and co-stimulatory molecules involved in antigen presentation to T cells, and reach their full maturation stage (1Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12349) Google Scholar, 2Trombetta E.S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev.

Although generally correct, this picture is now proving to be too simple. For example, it was recently found that iDCs are also involved in induction and maintenance of T cell tolerance in peripheral tissues (4Mahnke K. Schmitt E. Bonifaz L. Enk A.H. Jonuleit H. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). dendritic cell intracellular calcium concentration immature DC lipopolysaccharide nuclear factor of activated T-cells nuclear factor κ-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells 4′ 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate interleukin-4 Toll-like receptor inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor total internal reflection fluorescence fluorescein isothiocyanate. Immature DCs, produced by culturing monocytes for 5 days in medium containing granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor and interleukin-4 (IL-4), are phenotypically, morphologically, and functionally identical with iDCs occurring in vivo (5Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4522) Google Scholar). Their maturation is controlled by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), one of the best characterized classes of pattern recognition receptors of mammalian species. Most mammalian species express about 10–15 different TLRs that are encoded by a yet to be defined number of genes. Interestingly, distinct subsets of DCs express different TLRs, and their engagement results in DC maturation (6Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar). In fact, monocyte-derived DCs can be induced to mature very efficiently by incubating them with nanogram to microgram (per ml) concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through engagement of TLR4 receptors (7Langenkamp A. Messi M. Lanzavecchia A. Sallusto F. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). In addition, other ligands such as the synthetic TLR7 ligand imidazoquinoline, a reagent already used as adjuvant in the treatment of viral infections and skin tumors (8Hengge U.R. Ruzicka T. Dermatol. Surg. 2004; 30: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Urosevic M. Dummer R. Am. J. Clin. Dermatol. 2004; 5: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Bracci L.

The signaling pathways leading to DC maturation are complex and involve nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB as well as increases in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) (11Bagley K.C.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 3823-3837PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ is one of the most ubiquitous second messengers underlying cellular responses such as secretion, motility, proliferation, and death. Interestingly, Ca2+-sensitive transcription factors including NFAT and NF-κB regulate the expression of Ca2+-sensitive genes including IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ (16Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 17Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). Some cell types exhibit oscillatory changes of their cytosolic Ca2+, and these have been correlated to a variety of cellular functions. For example, in T-cells, depending on their frequency, oscillations trigger Ca2+-dependent activation of the transcription factors NFAT, NF-κB, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (18Lewis R.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 925-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, Ca2+ oscillations have been implicated in differentiation (19Kawano S. Otsu K. Kuruma A. Shoji S. Yanagida E. Muto Y. Yoshikawa F. Hirayama Y. Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. Cell Calcium. 2006; 39: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), in embryonic stem cell-derived primitive endodermal cells, oscillations have been implicated in the exo/endocytotic vesicle shuttle (20Sauer H. Hofmann C. Wartenberg M. Wobus A.M. Hescheler J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and in human astrocytoma cells Ca2+ oscillations have been implicated in cell migration (21Rondé P. Giannone G. Gerasymova I. Stoeckel H. Takeda K. Haiech J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signaling is also known to be involved in the regulation of immune cell function, and its importance is emphasized by the fact that most immune cells including DCs express several classes of Ca2+ channels on their plasma membrane (22Hsu S.F. O'Connell P.J. Klyachko V.A. Badminton M.N. Thomson A.W. Jackson M.B. Clapham D.E. Ahern G.P. J.

In this context it is worth mentioning that the involvement of Ca2+ signaling events in DC maturation has been postulated for a number of years (14Koski G.K. Schwartz G.N. Weng D.E. Czerniecki B.J. Carter C. Gress R.E. Cohen P.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 82-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Czerniecki B.J. Carter C. Rivoltini L. Koski G.K. Kim H.I. Weng D.E. Roros J.G. Hijazi Y.M. Xu S. Rosenberg S.A. Cohen P.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3823-3837PubMed Google Scholar), and we recently demonstrated that ryanodine receptor 1-mediated Ca2+ signals can act synergistically with signals generated via Toll-like receptors driving DC maturation (26Bracci L. Vukcevic M. Spagnoli G. Ducreux S. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 27Vukcevic M. Spagnoli G.C. Iezzi G. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34913-34922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present report we show that spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations occur in iDCs. These oscillations occur only in iDCs and are lost during the maturation process, and their abrogation leads to the cytoplasmic localization of endogenous NFAT. The results of this study offer additional insights into some of the signaling processes controlling maturation of DCs. iDCs were generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as previously described (29Schnurr M. Toy T. Shin A. Hartmann G. Rothenfusser S. Soellner J. Davis I.D. Cebon J. Maraskovsky E. Blood. 2004; 103: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, monocytes were purified by positive sorting using anti-CD14-conjugated magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The recovered cells (95–98% purity) were cultured for 5 days at 3–4 × 105/ml in differentiation medium containing RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics (all from Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor (Laboratory Pablo Cassarà, Buenos Aires, Argentina) and 1000 units/ml IL-4 (a gift from A. Lanzavecchia, Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Bellinzona, Switzerland). Maturation was induced by the addition of LPS 1 μg/ml (from Salmonella abortus equi, Sigma) to the culture medium. In some experiments DC maturation was induced by the addition of the synthetic TLR7 agonist, imidazoquinoline (3M-001) (final concentration 3 μm), that was kindly provided by 3M Pharmaceuticals (St. Paul, MN). Ca2+ measurements were performed on DCs loaded with fast Ca2+ indicator fluo-4 (Invitrogen; 5 μm final concentration). In some experiments cells were incubated with 100 μm 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) (Calbiochem), 1 μm Xestospongin C (Calbiochem), or 2 μm thapsigargin with 0.5 mm EGTA during the loading procedure. After loading, cells were rinsed once, resuspended in Krebs-Ringer medium, and allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine (1:60 dilution) (Sigma)-treated glass coverslips that were than mounted onto a 37 °C thermostatted chamber. On-line epifluorescence images were acquired every 100 ms for 50 s using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E fluorescent microscope equipped with an oil immersion CFI Plan Apochromat 60× TIRF objective (1.45 numerical aperture). Changes in fluorescence were detected by exciting at 488 nm and recording the emission at 510 nm via an electron multiplier C9100–13 Hamamatsu CCD camera which allows fast data acquisition (maximal temporal resolution 1 frame (110 × 110 pixels/8 ms). Where indicated, either 1 μg/ml LPS or 2 μm U73122 (Bio Mol) was added during the measurements. To investigate the dynamics of Ca2+influx, we measured fluorescent changes in the TIRF mode; first we identified the focal plane at the coverglass/cell membrane contact with a surface reflective interference contrast filter, and this focal plane was maintained throughout the recordings by means of the perfect focus system that exploits an infrared laser beam and a quadrant diode for online control of the microscope focusing motor. Image analysis was performed with the MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) software package. Endocytosis was followed by incubating DCs in RPMI medium containing 0.5 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran (Fluka Biochemicals, Buchs, Switzerland) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, and the number of FITC-positive cells was assessed by flow cytometry. In some experiments, before incubation with FITC-dextran, cells were treated for 45 min with 100 μm 2-APB or with LPS (1 μg/ml) or with the TLR-7 agonist 3M-001 (3 μm) for 18 h. Gene expression was quantified by real time PCR as previously described (26Bracci L. Vukcevic M. Spagnoli G. Ducreux S. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–2 × 106 iDCs were incubated for 18 h with 1 μm Xestospongin C, 100 μm 2-APB, 3 μm imidazoquinoline (3M-001), or 1 μg/ml LPS. Total RNA was extracted and treated with deoxyribonuclease I (Invitrogen) to eliminate contaminant genomic DNA. After reverse transcription using 500 ng of RNA and the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), cDNA was amplified by quantitative real-time PCR in the ABI PrismTM7700 using the TaqMan® technology. Commercially available exon-intron junction-designed primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, CD83, CD80 CD86, interferon-α, and IL23A (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA) were used. Gene expression was normalized using self-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as reference (26Bracci L. Vukcevic M. Spagnoli G. Ducreux S. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The data from DCs isolated from five donors were pooled and are expressed as -fold increase in gene expression compared with untreated iDCs. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on methanol:acetone (1:1)-fixed DCs using rabbit anti-NFATc1 (sc-13033) or rabbit anti- NF-κB p65 antibody (sc-109, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by Alexa fluor 488-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen). Nuclei were visualized by 4′ 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI; 100 μm) (Invitrogen) staining. Fluorescence was detected using a fluorescent Axiovert S100 TV inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) equipped with an ×40 FLUAR objective and Zeiss filter sets (BP 475/40, FT 500, and BP 530/50; BP 546, FT 560, and 575–640) for detection of DAPI and FITC fluorescence, respectively. The cytosolic fraction of 6 × 106 DCs was extracted as described by Healy et al. (30Healy J.I. Dolmetsch R.E. Timmerman L.A. Cyster J.G. Thomas M.L. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 419-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once and resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA to which 50 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 4 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.8% Nonidet P-40 were added. Cells were incubated on ice for 2 min, and the nuclear and membrane fractions were removed by centrifugation (600 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Laemmli loading buffer (10% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) was added to the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) which was boiled for 5 min and then loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose, and the blots were probed with a rabbit anti-NFATc1 antibody (1:500; sc-13033, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by peroxidase-conjugated protein G (1:250,000) and with mouse anti-β tubulin (Santa Cruz sc-5274) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200,000). The immunopositive bands were visualized by autoradiography using the Super Signal West Dura chemiluminescence kit from Thermo Scientific (for NFAT) and BM chemiluminescence kit from Roche Applied Science (for β-tubulin). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for paired samples; means were considered statistically significant when the p value was <0.05. When more than two samples were compared, analysis was performed by the ANOVA test followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. The PROC MIXED statistical analysis program (SAS 9.2) on log-transformed data were used for real-time PCR gene expression analysis from independent biological replicates. The Origin computer program (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA) was used to generate graphs and for statistical analysis. Statistical analysis of categorical data was performed using the χ2 test for contingency tables with a 0.05 level of significance using R software (R development Core team 2008; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; ISBN 3-900051-07-0) was used to perform χ2 tests. Immature DCs were loaded with the fast calcium indicator fluo-4 and were observed by conventional epifluorescence microscopy in the absence of added stimuli. Such cells display large rhythmic fluctuations of their cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Fig. 1A) with ∼40% of the cells exhibiting oscillations with a frequency of one peak every 12.5 s (Table 1). Interestingly, the addition of LPS (Fig. 1B) or of the TLR-7 agonist (not shown) to iDCs did not affect the high frequency oscillations nor did it cause any immediate changes in the [Ca2+]i. On the other hand, when mature DCs (treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 18 h) were observed under identical conditions, the high frequency oscillations were no longer present (Fig. 1C). In the latter case of the 162 individual cells that were monitored, 100% responded with a single, small increase of the [Ca2+]i within the 50-s measurement (Table 1). To determine the source of Ca2+ in the oscillations, iDCs were treated with (i) 100 μm 2-APB, a blocker of store-operated Ca2+ entry, and of InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release, (ii) 2 μm thapsigargin, a SERCA (sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase) inhibitor that leads to depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, and (iii) 2 μm U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C. The addition of these compounds completely abolished the spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 1, D–F). DCs were also incubated with other pharmacological agents as shown in Table 1; the addition of 100 μm La3+ or 0.5 mm EGTA significantly reduced the frequency of oscillations from 40% cells showing 4–8 peaks/50 s to about 18% cells showing 4–8 peaks/50 s, indicating that Ca2+ influx plays some role in the oscillatory events. The addition of 1 μm Xestospongin C (an inhibitor of InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release) significantly diminished the frequency of the oscillations (Table 1) as well as the peak fluo-4 fluorescence in iDCs (Fig. 2). These results strongly suggest that the oscillations are mainly due to InsP3-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, with a component (probably involved in store refilling) due to influx from the extracellular environment. The phenotype of mature DCs, on the other hand, was quite different irrespective of whether the cells had been induced to mature via TLR-4 activation (by overnight incubation with 1 μg/ml LPS) or via activation of TLR-7 (by overnight incubation with 3 μm imidazoquinoline (3M-001)). In fact, LPS-matured DCs did not show the high frequency oscillations but rather small and slow (1 peak/50 s) spontaneous fluctuations of their [Ca2+]i. Interestingly, incubation with imidazoquinoline, which does not transmit a maturation signal as strong as that conveyed by LPS (see CD83 expression in Fig. 5A), resulted in DCs with an intermediate phenotype; that is, with only a small proportion of cells showing 2–8 oscillations/min whose magnitude is comparable with that exhibited by iDCs (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The slow peak Ca2+ increase observed in mature DCs was reduced by more than 50% by the addition of 100 μm 2-APB (Fig. 2), whereas the peak transient observed in the presence of Krebs-Ringer medium containing no additional Ca2+ and 0.5 mm EGTA was not different from that observed in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (1.79 ± 0.31 and 2.10 ± 0.35 ΔF increase in Ca2+ and EGTA containing medium respectively). These results indicate that in mature DCs as well, the slow Ca2+ transient is mainly do to release from intracellular stores.TABLE 1Characterization of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in DCsTotal no. cells1 peak/50 s2–4 peaks/50 s4–8 peaks/50 s%%%iDC838.3051.7040.00iDC+ 100 μm La3+6036.704518.33iDC+ 0.5 mm EGTA6628.8053.8017.40iDC+ 100 μm 2-APB11610000iDC+ 1 μm Xesto C5648.214110.71LPS-matured DC16210000TLR7-matured DC26670.0020.0010.00 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Magnitude of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in DCs.

As shown in Fig. 3 oscillations are accompanied by [Ca2+]i influx in iDCs. Cells were allowed to attach onto the glass coverslips, and the areas of attachment were identified with the surface reflection interference contrast filter (Fig. 3, panel B). This focal plane was fixed using the perfect focus system, and changes in the [Ca2+]i, which in this case represent Ca2+ events occurring at or very close to the plasma membrane, were monitored (Fig. 3, panel C). The pseudocolor images in panel C represent the changes of fluo-4 fluorescence ΔF (F/Fo) at four time points, whereas panel D represents the kymographs of three selected cells (arrows in panel C) showing that these changes in [Ca2+]ioccur at different time points in different cells during the 50 s of recording. The specificity of the signal is demonstrated by the fact that the increase in fluo-4 fluorescence only occurs when cells are bathed in Krebs-Ringer solution containing 2 mm Ca2+ but is absent when cells are bathed in Krebs-Ringer solution containing 100 μm La3+ (a nonspecific blocker of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels) or in LPS-matured DCs (Fig. 3, panel E). These results support the finding that oscillations of the [Ca2+]i are a specific feature of iDC that is lost upon differentiation but convey little information as to their biological role. We hypothesized that oscillations may be implicated in maintaining the immature phenotype by acting on transcription factors, in particular on the Ca2+-sensitive transcription factor NFAT. To dissect the intracellular pathways directly downstream of the spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations, we followed the intracellular localization of endogenous NFAT in oscillating iDCs or in DCs in which oscillations had been inhibited by 2-APB and in mature DCs. The cytosolic fraction of DCs was obtained from untreated iDCs, iDCs treated for 15 and 45 min with 2-APB, LPS-matured DCs, and iDCs treated with cyclosporine, a drug that reduces the nuclear translocation of NFAT by inhibiting the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Fig. 4A shows a representative Western blot and Fig. 4B shows a bar graph of the intensities of the immunopositive bands of the cytosolic content of NFATc1. LPS-matured DCs, which lack the high frequency Ca2+ oscillations, show the highest level of cytoplasmic expression of NFAT. Similarly, its cytoplasmic level is high in cyclosporine-treated iDCs but is significantly reduced in the cytoplasm of untreated iDCs. Treatment of the latter cells with 2-APB induced the cytoplasmic localization of NFATc1. Fig. 4C shows the subcellular localization of NFATc1 by immunofluorescence; indeed, in iDCs a number of cells exhibit nuclear distribution of NFAT (arrows), whereas iDCs treated with cyclosporine or in mature DCs the fluorescence is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. These results indicate that most of the transcription factor NFAT is targeted to the nucleus in oscillating iDCs but that abrogation of Ca2+ oscillations with 2-APB results in the preservation of NFATc1 within the cytoplasm.

This study examined the role of HSP70B′, a poorly characterized member of the HSP70 family, in response to oxidatively modified LDL (oxLDL) and immune complexes prepared with human oxLDL and purified human antibodies to oxLDL (oxLDL-IC) in monocytic and macrophage cell lines. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates and conditioned medium from U937 cells treated with oxLDL alone revealed an increase in intracellular HSP70B′ protein levels accompanied by a concomitant increase in HSP70B′ extracellular levels. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, however, demonstrated that oxLDL-IC stimulated the release of HSP70B′, which co-localized with cell-associated oxLDL-IC. In HSP70B′-green fluorescent protein-transfected mouse RAW 264.7 cells, oxLDL-IC-induced HSP70B′ co-localized with membrane-associated oxLDL-IC as well as the lipid moiety of internalized oxLDL-IC. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that HSP70B′ is involved in cell survival, and this effect could be mediated by sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) activation. An examination of regularly implicated cytokines revealed a significant relationship between HSP70B′ and the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Small interfering RNA knockdown of HSP70B′ resulted in a corresponding decrease in SK1 mRNA levels and SK1 phosphorylation as well as increased release of IL-10. In conclusion, these findings suggest that oxLDL-IC induce the synthesis and release of HSP70B′, and once stimulated, HSP70B′ binds to the cell-associated and internalized lipid moiety of oxLDL-IC. The data also implicate HSP70B′ in key cellular functions, such as regulation of SK1 activity and release of IL-10, which influence macrophage activation and survival.

Evidence exists that HSP expression is higher at sites of atherosclerotic lesions than it is in normal tissue (3Pockley A.G.

Elevated HSP70 levels are associated with atherosclerotic plaques, particularly in areas with abundant activated macrophages, and seem to coincide around sites of necrosis and lipid accumulation (5Johnson A.D. Berberian P.A. Tytell M. Bond M.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6Berberian P.A. Myers W. Tytell M. Challa V. Bond M.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 71-80PubMed Google Scholar).Of particular interest in the development of atherogenesis is the role of oxidatively modified LDL (oxLDL). It is established that oxLDL particles are taken up by activated macrophages, resulting in lipid accumulation (7Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20963-20966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). oxLDL also triggers an immune response, initiating the production of predominantly proinflammatory IgG antibodies, which then form circulating complexes with oxLDL (oxLDL-IC) (8Virella G.

These immune complexes activate macrophages through the FcγRI receptor, resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) and the associated acceleration of foam cell formation (10Virella G.

However, the role HSP70 family members play in the development of atherosclerotic plaques is still unclear. Increasing evidence suggests that HSPs may serve as cytokines themselves. Asea et al.

This finding supports earlier experiments that induced cytokine production with the addition of exogenous HSP70 (22Asea A. Kraeft S.K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W. Koo G.C.

Svensson et al. (24Svensson P.A. Asea A. Englund M.C. Bausero M.A. Jernås M. Wiklund O. Ohlsson B.G. Carlsson L.M. Carlsson B. Atherosclerosis. 2006; 185: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) demonstrated that high levels of oxLDL directly up-regulate and initiate release of HSP70 in macrophages, resulting in a corresponding increase in cytokine (IL-1β and IL-12) production. Whether exposure of human macrophages to elevated levels of oxLDL-IC elicits HSP70 regulation has not been previously examined.We have recently shown that one member of the HSP70 family, HSP70B′ (also known as HSP70 protein 6; gene HSPA6), displayed a considerable increase in expression in response to oxLDL-IC but not oxLDL alone (25Hammad S.M. Twal W.O. Barth J.L. Smith K.J. Saad A.F. Virella G. Argraves W.S. Lopes-Virella M.F. Atherosclerosis. 2009; 202: 394-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence was provided that IL-1β secretion is HSP70B′-dependent, suggesting a novel, oxLDL-IC-dependent proinflammatory mechanism involving the little known HSP70B′ species (25Hammad S.M. Twal W.O. Barth J.L. Smith K.J. Saad A.F. Virella G. Argraves W.S. Lopes-Virella M.F. Atherosclerosis. 2009; 202: 394-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The HSP70B′ gene is unique to the human genome, probably arising after the divergence of rodents and humans (26Parsian A.J. Sheren J.E. Tao T.Y. Goswami P.C. Malyapa R. Van Rheeden R. Watson M.S. Hunt C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 201-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and although HSP70B′ and HSP70 are over 80% homologous, differences are present in sequences coding for substrate-binding and activation sites, evidence of a unique cellular function (27Noonan E.J. Place R.F. Giardina C. Hightower L.E. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2007; 12: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Until recently, sequence data and immunological reagents for HSP70B′ were unavailable, and due to the sequence homology, standard antibodies designed for the common HSP70A/B members most likely included the detection of HSP70B′. HSP70, while functionally inducible, is fairly ubiquitous at basal conditions in many different cell types, whereas HSP70B′ is strictly inducible (27Noonan E.J. Place R.F. Giardina C. Hightower L.E. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2007; 12: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Leung T.K. Rajendran M.Y. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim L. Biochem.

Our recent findings have led to the hypothesis that HSP70B′ expression could be induced by Fcγ-RI activation in human macrophages, resulting in increased proinflammatory cytokine release, prolonged foam cell survival, and thus the associated increased risk of atherosclerotic plaque development (18Hammad S.M. Taha T.A. Nareika A. Johnson K.R. Lopes-Virella M.F. Obeid L.M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2006; 79: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Hammad S.M. Twal W.O. Barth J.L.

Herein, we show that HSP70B′ was induced and released in response to oxLDL-IC and that HSP70B′ could bind to the cell-associated and internalized lipid moiety of oxLDL-IC. The presented data also implicated HSP70B′ in cellular functions that underlie the ability of oxLDL-IC to promote prolonged activation of foam cells, such as regulation of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) activity and release of IL-10.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we examined the role of HSP70B′, a poorly characterized member of the heat shock protein 70 family, in foam cell activation and survival induced by oxLDL-IC. HSP70B′ appears to play a unique and complex role in macrophage activation associated with oxLDL-IC signaling. The results showed for the first time that human monocytic cells respond to oxLDL-IC by stimulating and secreting HSP70B′. The results also showed that HSP70B′ appears to become associated with the intracellular as well as membrane-associated oxLDL-IC lipid moiety. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that HSP70B′ is involved in cell survival, and this effect could be mediated by SK1 activation. The regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by HSP70B′ provides further evidence of the involvement of the little known member of the HSP70 family, HSP70B′, in foam cell functionality. Investigating the significance of HSPs, not only as classical chaperones and stress proteins, but as complex signaling molecules is of increasing importance in understanding the mechanisms involved in the activity of foam cells, a hallmark of atherosclerotic plaques.In a recent study, we identified 83 genes as being similarly regulated by oxLDL-IC in the human leukemic monocyte lymphoma U937 cell line (25Hammad S.M. Twal W.O. Barth J.L. Smith K.J. Saad A.F. Virella G. Argraves W.S. Lopes-Virella M.F. Atherosclerosis. 2009; 202: 394-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Among the up-regulated genes, HSP70B′ showed the highest increase in expression. Despite the substantial increase of HSP70B′ at the gene level in response to oxLDL-IC, the fate of the protein could not be determined using immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1). The lack of HSP70B′ protein suggested aborted translation, improper folding, and/or complexing to an undetermined molecule(s) concealing the antibody binding sites. Due to cross-linking of the Fcγ receptors with immune complexes (oxLDL-IC and KLH-IC), we believe that the HSP70B′ protein and possibly other stimulated proteins, such as SK1 (18Hammad S.M. Taha T.A. Nareika A. Johnson K.R. Lopes-Virella M.F. Obeid L.M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2006; 79: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Hengst J.A. Guilford J.M. Fox T.E. Wang X. Conroy E.J. Yun J.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 492: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), become part of lipid rafts and/or the detergent-resistant membrane fraction. To extract the cell membrane-associated HSP70B′, which is demonstrated clearly in the confocal microscopy images, we used several different detergents and extraction buffers (38Shogomori H. Brown D.A. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These did not improve the extractability of HSP70B′, from cells induced by immune complexes beyond what is shown in Fig. 1D. Interestingly, we were able to detect more HSP70B′ protein in response to KLH-IC than oxLDL-IC (Fig. 1D), which reflects appropriately the higher gene expression of HSP70B′ in response to KLH-IC compared with oxLDL-IC (25Hammad S.M.

Apparently, the protein expression of HSP70B′ in response to oxLDL alone is mainly post-translational because it reached a plateau at 6 h post-treatment.HSP70 has been shown to form complexes with a number of intracellular proteins (39Davidoff A.M. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 3439-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and more recently HSPs have been shown to bind to intracellular lipids (29Noonan E. Giardina C. Hightower L. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 2468-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Osterloh A. Kalinke U. Weiss S. Fleischer B. Breloer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4669-4680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 41Tsan M.F. Gao B. Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 1: 274-279PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that oxLDL-IC on the surface of the cells become associated with secreted HSP70B′ (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). This association may inhibit the presumed autocrine effect of HSP70B′ on cell signaling.The differential trafficking of oxLDL and oxLDL-IC probably plays a role in the action of HSP70B′. Differences in trafficking could be due to differences in receptor binding, uptake, and delivery to lysosomes and/or to lysosomal and post-lysosomal processing. Several studies have previously shown that the lipid and protein moieties are metabolized in lysosomes within hours after internalization of oxLDL (42Li W. Yuan X.M. Brunk U.T. Free Radic.

Live cell imaging shown in Fig. 3A demonstrated internalization of oxLDL-IC and co-localization with HSP70B′-GFP at 4 h post-treatment. This novel finding suggests that induced HSP70B′ could bind to cytoplasmic oxLDL-IC but not to oxLDL in the lysosomal compartment.There have been several reports implicating HSPs in survival of immune cells (46Kusher D.I. Ware C.F. Gooding L.R. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2925-2931PubMed Google Scholar, 47Williams R.S. Thomas J.A. Fina M. German Z. Benjamin I.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 48Hirvonen M.R. Brüne B. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), mostly suggesting a protective function against inflammation and other types of stressors. Our data suggest that inducible HSP70B′ may have an inhibitory effect on macrophage cell growth and survival. For example, cells overexpressing HSP70B′ showed significantly decreased cell proliferation and knockdown of HSP70B′-attenuated oxLDL-induced cell death compared with controls.A mechanism regularly implicated in mediating prosurvival and inflammatory responses to macrophage cell survival is regulation of SK1, an enzyme that is responsible for the generation of the signaling molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate (49Taha T.A. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 39: 113-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that SK1 mRNA levels increased in response to oxLDL-IC in U937 cells (25Hammad S.M. Twal W.O. Barth J.L. Smith K.J. Saad A.F. Virella G. Argraves W.S. Lopes-Virella M.F. Atherosclerosis. 2009; 202: 394-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and we also showed that oxLDL-IC prompt the release of SK1 into the medium, suggesting the generation of sphingosine 1-phosphate extracellularly (18Hammad S.M. Taha T.A. Nareika A. Johnson K.R. Lopes-Virella M.F. Obeid L.M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2006; 79: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that overexpression of HSP70 in RAW 264.7 macrophages resulted in both increased SK1 protein and mRNA levels, contributing to the partial reversal of cell death caused by the combination of LPS and SK1 inhibitor (50Ding X.Z. Feng X.R. Borschel R.H. Nikolich M.P. Feng J. Li Y.S. Hoover D.L. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that knockdown of HSP70B′ reduced the expression of SK1 by half in response to oxLDL-IC, suggesting that HSP70B′ is an upstream mediator of SK1. Furthermore, phosphorylated SK1 is significantly reduced in U937 cells transfected with HSP70B′ siRNA compared with control cells treated with oxLDL. These data are the first to suggest an interaction between HSP70B′ and SK1 and could significantly influence further research to define SK1 effects mediating macrophage activation and survival.The anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, has been shown to be cytoprotective in macrophages (51Arai T. Hiromatsu K. Nishimura H. Kimura Y. Kobayashi N. Ishida H. Nimura Y. Yoshikai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and induced by the addition of exogenous HSP70 in synovial cells (52Detanico T. Rodrigues L. Sabritto A.C. Keisermann M. Bauer M.E. Zwickey H. Bonorino C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2004; 135: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 53Luo X. Zuo X. Zhang B. Song L. Wei X. Zhou Y. Xiao X. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2008; 13: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that HSPs play an active role in suppressing inflammation by the regulation of IL-10. Here we provide evidence that secretion of IL-10 may be regulated by HSP70B′.Although HSPs are classically viewed as intracellular proteins, we provided evidence that HSP70B′ is induced and secreted in response to cell activation by oxLDL-IC. This is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that HSPs may be released by viable cells under inflammatory stress (3Pockley A.G. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 22Asea A. Kraeft S.K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W. Koo G.C. Calderwood S.K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that HSP70 can be secreted from cells via exosomes (54Clayton A. Turkes A. Navabi H. Mason M.D. Tabi Z. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3631-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 55Lancaster G.I. Febbraio M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23349-23355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that in stressed cells, HSPs may be inserted into the plasma membrane before release into the extracellular environment in membrane-associated structures (56Vega V.L. Rodríguez-Silva M. Frey T. Gehrmann M. Diaz J.C. Steinem C. Multhoff G. Arispe N. De Maio A. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 4299-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that regulate the mobilization of secretory vesicles and secretion of mediators from inflammatory cells, including macrophages, are still obscure (57Medzhitov R. Nature. 2008; 454: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar, 58Logan M.R. Odemuyiwa S.O. Moqbel R. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: 923-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In conclusion, our current data suggest that HSP70B′ is induced and released by macrophages stimulated by oxLDL-IC and that once released into the extracellular space, HSP70B′ immediately associates with oxLDL-IC. We also provided evidence that a variety of cellular responses, including regulation of SK1 and release of the anti-inflammatory prosurvival cytokine IL-10, could be mediated by HSP70B′. Our findings contribute to the understanding of foam cell survival and activation and may advance efforts to reveal additional therapeutic targets that could mediate the stabilization of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques.

Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 2Xu Q. Wick G. Mol. Med. Today. 1996; 2: 372-379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Evidence exists that HSP expression is higher at sites of atherosclerotic lesions than it is in normal tissue (3Pockley A.G. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 4Roma P. Catapano A.L. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 127: 147-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Elevated HSP70 levels are associated with atherosclerotic plaques, particularly in areas with abundant activated macrophages, and seem to coincide around sites of necrosis and lipid accumulation (5Johnson A.D. Berberian P.A. Tytell M. Bond M.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6Berberian P.A. Myers W. Tytell M. Challa V. Bond M.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 71-80PubMed Google Scholar).Of particular interest in the development of atherogenesis is the role of oxidatively modified LDL (oxLDL). It is established that oxLDL particles are taken up by activated macrophages, resulting in lipid accumulation (7Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20963-20966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). oxLDL also triggers an immune response, initiating the production of predominantly proinflammatory IgG antibodies, which then form circulating complexes with oxLDL (oxLDL-IC) (8Virella G. Koskinen S. Krings G. Onorato J.M. Thorpe S.R. Lopes-Virella M. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 95: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Virella G. Lopes-Virella M.F. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2003; 10: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These immune complexes activate macrophages through the FcγRI receptor, resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) and the associated acceleration of foam cell formation (10Virella G.

Res. 2003; 92: e20-e29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Martinet W. Kockx M.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Vicca S. Massy Z.A. Hennequin C. Rihane D. Drüeke T.B. Lacour B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), oxLDL complexed to IgG was found to promote survival (17Bianchi G. Montecucco F.

However, the role HSP70 family members play in the development of atherosclerotic plaques is still unclear. Increasing evidence suggests that HSPs may serve as cytokines themselves. Asea et al.

To investigate their incorporation into DNA at atomic level resolution, we present crystal structures of human DNA polymerase λ (Pol λ) bound to gapped DNA and containing either AraC or dFdC paired opposite template dG. These structures reveal that AraC and dFdC can bind within the nascent base pair binding pocket of Pol λ. Although the conformation of the ribose of AraCTP is similar to that of normal dCTP, the conformation of dFdCTP is significantly different. Consistent with these structures, Pol λ efficiently incorporates AraCTP but not dFdCTP. The data are consistent with the possibility that Pol λ could modulate the cytotoxic effect of AraC.

Inasmuch as traces of reducing material were found to be formed, and oxalic acid was also obtained by the action of the fungus on glucose, it appeared that an introductory hydrolysis was a necessary prerequisite for the formation of oxalic acid."
