https://openalex.org/W2755486970,"Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is thought to contribute to the establishment of many biomolecular condensates, eukaryotic cell structures that concentrate diverse macromolecules but lack a bounding membrane. RNA granules control RNA metabolism and comprise a large class of condensates that are enriched in RNA-binding proteins and RNA molecules. Many RNA granule proteins are composed of both modular domains and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) having low amino acid sequence complexity. Phase separation of these molecules likely plays an important role in the generation and stability of RNA granules. To understand how folded domains and IDRs can cooperate to modulate LLPS, we generated a series of engineered proteins. These were based on fusions of an IDR derived from the RNA granule protein FUS (fused in sarcoma) to a multivalent poly-Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that phase-separates when mixed with a poly-proline–rich-motif (polyPRM) ligand. We found that the wild-type IDR promotes LLPS of the polySH3–polyPRM system, decreasing the phase separation threshold concentration by 8-fold. Systematic mutation of tyrosine residues in Gly/Ser-Tyr-Gly/Ser motifs of the IDR reduced this effect, depending on the number but not on the position of these substitutions. Mutating all tyrosines to non-aromatic residues or phosphorylating the IDR raised the phase separation threshold above that of the unmodified polySH3–polyPRM pair. These results show that low-complexity IDRs can modulate LLPS both positively and negatively, depending on the degree of aromaticity and phosphorylation status. Our findings provide plausible mechanisms by which these sequences could alter RNA granule properties on evolutionary and cellular timescales."
https://openalex.org/W2756154407,"By exploiting geometric constraints and interfacial forces instead of chemistry, colloidal clusters can be controllably coalesced into particles with uniformly distributed surface patches. 'Patchy' particles are colloidal particles with patches, usually in predetermined geometries, on their surfaces. These patches can be used to directionally bond particles together or for other applications where different surface chemistries are valuable. Introducing patches in geometrically ordered locations on a spherical surface can involve multistep processes, potentially limiting the scale on which such particles can be made. Now Stefano Sacanna and colleagues have developed a method—'colloidal fusion'—that involves the controlled coalescence of colloidal clusters into a single particle. At the core of the original cluster is a plasticizable particle, which is extruded outwards to eventually form the patches on the final particle. The location of the patches is therefore defined and controlled by the packing geometry of the original cluster. Patches on the surfaces of colloidal particles1,2,3,4,5 provide directional information that enables the self-assembly of the particles into higher-order structures. Although computational tools can make quantitative predictions and can generate design rules that link the patch motif of a particle to its internal microstructure and to the emergent properties of the self-assembled materials6,7,8, the experimental realization of model systems of particles with surface patches (or ‘patchy’ particles) remains a challenge. Synthetic patchy colloidal particles are often poor geometric approximations of the digital building blocks used in simulations9,10 and can only rarely be manufactured in sufficiently high yields to be routinely used as experimental model systems11,12,13,14. Here we introduce a method, which we refer to as colloidal fusion, for fabricating functional patchy particles in a tunable and scalable manner. Using coordination dynamics and wetting forces, we engineer hybrid liquid–solid clusters that evolve into particles with a range of patchy surface morphologies on addition of a plasticizer. We are able to predict and control the evolutionary pathway by considering surface-energy minimization, leading to two main branches of product: first, spherical particles with liquid surface patches, capable of forming curable bonds with neighbouring particles to assemble robust supracolloidal structures; and second, particles with a faceted liquid compartment, which can be cured and purified to yield colloidal polyhedra. These findings outline a scalable strategy for the synthesis of patchy particles, first by designing their surface patterns by computer simulation, and then by recreating them in the laboratory with high fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W2727485655,"There is increasing evidence that science & engineering PhD students lose interest in an academic career over the course of graduate training. It is not clear, however, whether this decline reflects students being discouraged from pursuing an academic career by the challenges of obtaining a faculty job or whether it reflects more fundamental changes in students’ career goals for reasons other than the academic labor market. We examine this question using a longitudinal survey that follows a cohort of PhD students from 39 U.S. research universities over the course of graduate training to document changes in career preferences and to explore potential drivers of such changes. We report two main results. First, although the vast majority of students start the PhD interested in an academic research career, over time 55% of all students remain interested while 25% lose interest entirely. In addition, 15% of all students were never interested in an academic career during their PhD program, while 5% become more interested. Thus, the declining interest in an academic career is not a general phenomenon across all PhD students, but rather reflects a divergence between those students who remain highly interested in an academic career and other students who are no longer interested in one. Second, we show that the decline we observe is not driven by expectations of academic job availability, nor by related factors such as postdoctoral requirements or the availability of research funding. Instead, the decline appears partly due to the misalignment between students’ changing preferences for specific job attributes on the one hand, and the nature of the academic research career itself on the other. Changes in students’ perceptions of their own research ability also play a role, while publications do not. We discuss implications for scientific labor markets, PhD career development programs, and science policy."

https://openalex.org/W2755843571,"Inhibitors against poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) are promising targeted agents currently used to treat BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer and are in clinical trials for other cancer types, including BRCA-mutant breast cancer. To enhance the clinical response to PARP inhibitors (PARPis), understanding the mechanisms underlying PARPi sensitivity is urgently needed. Here, we show enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), an enzyme that catalyzes H3 lysine trimethylation and associates with oncogenic function, contributes to PARPi sensitivity in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, upon oxidative stress or alkylating DNA damage, PARP1 interacts with and attaches poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) chains to EZH2. PARylation of EZH2 by PARP1 then induces PRC2 complex dissociation and EZH2 downregulation, which in turn reduces EZH2-mediated H3 trimethylation. In contrast, inhibition of PARP by PARPi attenuates alkylating DNA damage-induced EZH2 downregulation, thereby promoting EZH2-mediated gene silencing and cancer stem cell property compared with PARPi-untreated cells. Moreover, the addition of an EZH2 inhibitor sensitizes the BRCA-mutant breast cells to PARPi. Thus, these results may provide a rationale for combining PARP and EZH2 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for BRCA-mutated breast and ovarian cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2755882776,"Melanoma is a heterogeneous tumor with different subpopulations showing different proliferation rates. Slow-cycling cells were previously identified in melanoma, but not fully biologically characterized. Using the label-retention method, we identified a subpopulation of slow-cycling cells, defined as label-retaining cells (LRC), with strong invasive properties. We demonstrate through live imaging that LRC are leaving the primary tumor mass at a very early stage and disseminate to peripheral organs. Through global proteome analyses, we identified the secreted protein SerpinE2/protease nexin-1 as causative for the highly invasive potential of LRC in melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W2755561465,"Despite advances in treatment, up to 30% of patients with early breast cancer (BC) experience distant disease relapse. However, a comprehensive understanding of tumor spread and site-specific recurrence patterns remains lacking. This retrospective case-control study included 103 consecutive patients with metastatic BC admitted to our institution (2000-2013). Cases were matched according to age, tumor biology, and clinicopathological features to 221 patients with non-metastatic BC (control group). The median follow-up period among the 324 eligible patients was 7.3 years. While relatively low values for sensitivity (71%) and specificity (56%) were found for axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement as an indicator of risk and pattern of distant relapse, nodal status remained the most powerful predictor of metastases (OR: 3.294; CL: 1.9-5.5). Rates of dissemination and metastatic efficiency differed according to molecular subtype. HER2-positive subtypes showed a stronger association with systemic spread (OR: 2.127; CL: 1.2-3.8) than other subgroups. Classification as Luminal or Non-Luminal showed an increased risk of lung and distant nodal recurrence, and a decreased risk in bone metastases in the Non-Luminal group (OR: 2.9, 3.345, and 0.2, respectively). Tumors with HER2 overexpression had a significantly high risk for distant relapse (OR: 2.127) compared with HER2-negative tumors and also showed higher central nervous system (CNS) and lung metastatic potential (OR: 5.6 and 2.65, respectively) and low risk of bone disease progression (OR: 0.294). Furthermore, we found significant associations between biological profiles and sites of recurrence. A new process of clinical/diagnostic staging, including molecular subtypes, could better predict the likelihood of distant relapses and their anatomical location. Recognition and appreciation of clinically distinct molecular subtypes may assist in evaluation of the probability of distant relapses and their sites. Our analysis provides new insights into management of metastatic disease behavior, to lead to an optimal disease-tailored approach and appropriate follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2755133015,"The ovarian follicle encloses oocytes in a microenvironment throughout their growth and acquisition of competence. Evidence suggests a dynamic interplay among follicular cells and oocytes, since they are constantly exchanging “messages”. We dissected bovine ovarian follicles and recovered follicular cells (FCs—granulosa and cumulus cells) and cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) to investigate whether the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway impacted oocyte quality. Following follicle rupture, COCs were individually selected for in vitro cultures to track the follicular cells based on oocyte competence to reach the blastocyst stage after parthenogenetic activation. Levels of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway components in FCs correlated with oocyte competence. This pathway is upregulated in FCs from follicles with high-quality oocytes that are able to reach the blastocyst stage, as indicated by decreased levels of PTEN and increased levels of the PTEN regulators bta-miR-494 and bta-miR-20a. Using PI3K-Akt responsive genes, we showed decreased FOXO3a levels and BAX levels in lower quality groups, indicating changes in cell cycle progression, oxidative response and apoptosis. Based on these results, the measurement of levels of PI3K-Akt pathway components in FCs from ovarian follicles carrying oocytes with distinct developmental competences is a useful tool to identify putative molecular pathways involved in the acquisition of oocyte competence."
https://openalex.org/W2755753508,"Interleukin-1 receptor–associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) plays a critical role in innate immune signaling by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and loss of IRAK4 activity in mice and humans increases susceptibility to bacterial infections and causes defects in TLR and IL1 ligand sensing. However, the mechanism by which IRAK4 activity regulates the production of downstream inflammatory cytokines is unclear. Using transcriptomic and biochemical analyses of human monocytes treated with a highly potent and selective inhibitor of IRAK4, we show that IRAK4 kinase activity controls the activation of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), a transcription factor implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases. Following TLR7/8 stimulation by its agonist R848, chemical inhibition of IRAK4 abolished IRF5 translocation to the nucleus and thus prevented IRF5 binding to and activation of the promoters of inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes. We also found that IKKβ, an upstream IRF5 activator, is phosphorylated in response to the agonist-induced TLR signaling. Of note, IRAK4 inhibition blocked IKKβ phosphorylation but did not block the nuclear translocation of NFκB, which was surprising, given the canonical role of IKKβ in phosphorylating IκB to allow NFκB activation. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of either IKKβ or the serine/threonine protein kinase TAK1 in monocytes blocked TLR-induced cytokine production and IRF5 translocation to the nucleus, but not nuclear translocation of NFκB.

https://openalex.org/W2753983528,"Systemic iron homeostasis is maintained by regulation of iron absorption in the duodenum, iron recycling from erythrocytes, and iron mobilization from the liver and is controlled by the hepatic hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin expression is induced via the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway that preferentially uses two type I (ALK2 and ALK3) and two type II (ActRIIA and BMPR2) BMP receptors. Hemojuvelin (HJV), HFE, and transferrin receptor-2 (TfR2) facilitate this process presumably by forming a plasma membrane complex with BMP receptors. Matriptase-2 (MT2) is a protease and key suppressor of hepatic hepcidin expression and cleaves HJV. Previous studies have therefore suggested that MT2 exerts its inhibitory effect by inactivating HJV. Here, we report that MT2 suppresses hepcidin expression independently of HJV. In Hjv−/− mice, increased expression of exogenous MT2 in the liver significantly reduced hepcidin expression similarly as observed in wild-type mice. Exogenous MT2 could fully correct abnormally high hepcidin expression and iron deficiency in MT2−/− mice. In contrast to MT2, increased Hjv expression caused no significant changes in wild-type mice, suggesting that Hjv is not a limiting factor for hepcidin expression. Further studies revealed that MT2 cleaves ALK2, ALK3, ActRIIA, Bmpr2, Hfe, and, to a lesser extent, Hjv and Tfr2. MT2-mediated Tfr2 cleavage was also observed in HepG2 cells endogenously expressing MT2 and TfR2. Moreover, iron-loaded transferrin blocked MT2-mediated Tfr2 cleavage, providing further insights into the mechanism of Tfr2’s regulation by transferrin. Together, these observations indicate that MT2 suppresses hepcidin expression by cleaving multiple components of the hepcidin induction pathway.

HFE and TfR2 are type I and type II transmembrane proteins, respectively. TfR2 can bind iron-saturated transferrin (holo-Tf) in the circulation and is proposed to sense body iron levels. HJV interacts with HFE and TfR2 (26D'Alessio F. Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. The hemochromatosis proteins HFE, TfR2, and HJV form a membrane-associated protein complex for hepcidin regulation.J.

The current model predicts that all these proteins form a complex with BMP receptors in the plasma membrane to facilitate the BMP signaling and hepcidin expression (1Muckenthaler M.U. Rivella S.

Hepatocytes possess an elegant but poorly understood machinery to sense iron status and adjust hepcidin expression to match the iron needs. Recent studies have implicated matriptase-2 (MT2) as a key player in this process. For the convenience of brevity, MT2 will be used for both gene and protein of human and mice throughout this paper. MT2 is a trypsin-like serine protease (28Velasco G. Cal S. Quesada V. Sánchez L.M. López-Otín C.

This type II transmembrane protease is composed of a short cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular domain, which contains a membrane-proximal stem region, a predicted cleavage activation site, and a C-terminal catalytic domain (Fig. 1A) (29Ramsay A.J.

Mutations in MT2 result in increased hepcidin expression, which leads to iron-refractory iron-deficiency anemia (30Finberg K.E. Heeney M.M. Campagna D.R. Aydinok Y. Pearson H.A. Hartman K.R.

Animal studies demonstrate that mice deficient in both Hjv and MT2 exhibited the phenotypes of Hjv−/− mice, including a marked decrease in hepatic hepcidin expression and systemic iron overload (33Finberg K.E.

By contrast, double mutant mice lacking functional Hfe or Tfr2 and MT2 exhibited a severe iron deficiency microcytic anemia phenotype mimicking the phenotype of single mutant mice lacking functional MT2 (41Lee P.

These observations suggest that MT2 suppresses hepcidin expression likely by decreasing the levels of HJV.Figure 5MT2 cleaves Hjv and mildly reduces its cell-surface localization.

B, MT2, but not S762A-MT2 or MT2-mask, cleaves Hjv in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells in 12-well plates were co-transfected with an equal amount of pCMV9-Hjv (2 μg), increasing amount of pCMV6-MT2, S762A-MT2, or MT2-mask (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 μg), and decreasing amount of pEGFP-N1 (2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5, and 0 μg). All cells were transfected with equal amounts of total plasmid DNA. Fresh medium was changed at 24 h post-transfection. After another 24 h of incubation, MT2 and Hjv in ∼150 μg of cell lysate proteins (L) were immunodetected by using anti-FLAG antibody. β-Actin and EGFP were detected by anti-β-actin and GFP antibodies, respectively. Hjv in ∼600 μl of CM was immunodetected by both anti-FLAG and anti-HJV antibodies. HEK293 cells (Ctrl) were included as a negative control for Hjv and MT2. Two MT2 images with different exposure times are presented. C, expression of MT2 mildly decreases cell-surface Hjv. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pCMV9-Hjv and an equal amount of pEGFP, pCMV6-MT2, or S762A-MT2 plasmid DNA. At about 48 h after transfection, cell-surface proteins were biotinylated at 4 °C, followed by pull-down of the biotinylated proteins using streptavidin-agarose beads. The eluted cell-surface proteins and about 10% of input lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunodetection of Hjv, MT2, Na+K+-ATPase (NaKATPase), β-actin, and EGFP using specific antibodies. D, quantification of Hjv bands in C. The intensities of full-length Hjv bands in cell lysate input and cell-surface eluates, as well as the furin-cleaved Hjv band in CM migrating at ∼45 kDa, were quantified by using an Alexa Fluor 800 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor). Only the data with and without MT2 were presented. Pair and two-tailed t test was used to calculate the significant difference between two groups. Results are from five independent experiments.

In addition, Hjv−/− mice still retain a robust mechanism to lower hepcidin expression in response to the decreased body iron level (39Zhao N. Maxson J.E. Zhang R.H. Wahedi M. Enns C.A. Zhang A.S.

These observations favor the idea that Hjv is not a limiting factor, and suggest that MT2 suppresses hepcidin expression through another mechanism. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that MT2 targets multiple key components of the hepcidin induction pathway to suppress hepcidin expression. Results showed that MT2 was able to reduce hepcidin expression independently of Hjv in vivo, and that MT2 cleaved cell surface ALK2, ALK3, ActRIIA, Bmpr2, Hfe, and to a lesser extent, Hjv and Tfr2 in transfected cells. These observations support the idea that MT2 suppresses hepcidin expression by cleaving multiple components of its induction pathway.

We aim to assess the association between CS itself (without medical indications) and risk of childhood asthma. Methods We conducted a hospital-based case-control study on childhood asthma with 573 cases and 812 controls in Shanghai. Unconditional logistic regression models in SAS were employed to control for potential confounders. Results Our study found that CS without medical indication was significantly associated with elevated asthma risk (adjusted OR = 1.58 [95% CI 1.17–2.13]). However, this risk was attenuated in children fed by exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months after birth (adjusted OR = 1.39 [95% CI 0.92–2.10]). In contrast, the risk was more prominent in children with non-exclusive breastfeeding or bottle feeding (adjusted OR = 1.91 [95% CI 1.22–2.99]). Conclusions CS without medical indication was associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. Exclusive breastfeeding in infancy may attenuate this risk."

This has unknown impacts on studies with unobtrusive designs based on digital (social) platforms, and studies of contemporary social phenomena in online settings. A lack of appropriate methods to identify, control for, and mitigate the effects of self-representation, the propensity to express socially responding characteristics or self-censorship in digital settings, hinders the ability of researchers to confidently interpret and generalize their findings. This article proposes applying boosted regression modelling to fill this research gap. A case study of paid Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (n = 509) is presented where workers completed psychometric surveys and provided anonymized access to their Facebook timelines. Our research finds indicators of self-representation on Facebook, facilitating suggestions for its mitigation. We validate the use of LIWC for Facebook personality studies, as well as find discrepancies with extant literature about the use of LIWC-only approaches in unobtrusive designs. Using survey data and LIWC sentiment categories as predictors, the boosted regression model classified the Five Factor personality model with an average accuracy of 74.6%. The contribution of this work is an accurate prediction of psychometric information based on short, informal text."
https://openalex.org/W2755856543,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a highly conserved transcription factor that mediates a broad spectrum of species-, strain-, sex-, age-, tissue-, and cell-specific responses elicited by structurally diverse ligands including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Dose-dependent effects on liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression were examined in male and female mice gavaged with TCDD every 4 days for 28 or 92 days. RNA-seq data revealed the coordinated repression of 181 genes predominately expressed in the liver including albumin (3.7-fold), α-fibrinogen (14.5-fold), and β-fibrinogen (17.4-fold) in males with corresponding AhR enrichment at 2 hr. Liver-specific genes exhibiting sexually dimorphic expression also demonstrated diminished divergence between sexes. For example, male-biased Gstp1 was repressed 3.0-fold in males and induced 4.5-fold in females, which were confirmed at the protein level. Disrupted regulation is consistent with impaired GHR-JAK2-STAT5 signaling and inhibition of female specific CUX2-mediated transcription as well as the repression of other key transcriptional regulators including Ghr, Stat5b, Bcl6, Hnf4a, Hnf6, Foxa1/2/3, and Zhx2. Attenuated liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression was concurrent with the induction of fetal genes such as alpha-fetoprotein. The results suggest AhR activation causes the loss of liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression producing a functionally “de-differentiated” hepatic phenotype."

Acute exposure of BCECs seeded in a capillary tube to 10 dynes/cm2 of shear stress (SS) resulted in activation of TRPV4 and SK currents. However, after incubation with HC067047 (TRPV4 inhibitor), SK currents could no longer be activated by SS, suggesting SK channel activation by SS was mediated through TRPV4. SK currents in BCECs were also activated by isoproterenol or by GSK1016790A (TRPV4 activator). In addition, preincubation of isolated coronary arterioles with apamin (SK inhibitor) resulted in a significant diminution of SSD whereas preincubation with HC067047 produced vasoconstriction by SS.

If unresolved, replication fork stalling caused by replication stress or DNA damage agents could induce genomic instability. PCNA is a principal component in the cellular response to replication fork stalling, and its functionality is tightly regulated in this respect (6Carr A.M. Paek A.L. Weinert T.

PCNA monoubiquitination induces switching to low-fidelity DNA polymerases that bypass DNA lesions (translesion synthesis, TLS). Polyubiquitination is believed to initiate the more complex template switching operation, wherein the intact sister strand is utilized to extend past the lesion (9Chang D.J. Cimprich K.A.

Mono- and polyubiquitination of PCNA are mediated by two distinct sets of E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) and E3 (ubiquitin-protein ligase) enzymes that operate in a linear fashion (12Andersen P.L.

This phosphorylation leads to mono- and polyubiquitination. In addition, our results suggest that IGF-1R contribute to rescue of replication fork stalling in cells exposed to DNA damage. After subcellular fractionation of human embryonic stem cell line H1 (WA01) hESCs (designated hESC henceforth), IGF-1R was detected in both cell nuclear and membrane fractions (Fig. 1A) using immunoblotting. This was supported by immunofluorescence microscopy of IGF-1R, which showed clear fluorescence signals within the hESC nuclei (Fig. 1B). This result was further supported by analysis of R+ and R− cells. These cell lines are igf1r knock-out MEF cells, stably transfected with (R+) and not transfected with IGF1R (R−). To investigate the role of nIGF-1R, we sought to collect IGF-1R-binding partners by immunoprecipitation (IP) of IGF-1R from hESC and to identify them by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS). IP of IgG served as a negative control. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Ten prominent gel bands observed in the IGF-1R sample but not the IgG sample were excised (supplemental Fig. S1A). After LC-MS, multiple potential binding partners were identified, including e.g. 14-3-3 proteins (previously described to bind IGF-1R (19Parvaresch S. Yesilkaya T. Baer K. Al-Hasani H. Klein H.W. 14-3-3 binding to the IGF-1 receptor is mediated by serine autophosphorylation.FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)), heat-shock-associated proteins, elongation factor 2 (proposed target of IGF-1R signaling (20Niu M. Klingler-Hoffmann M. Brazzatti J.A. Forbes B. Akekawatchai C. Hoffmann P. McColl S.R. Comparative proteomic analysis implicates eEF2 as a novel target of PI3Kγ in the MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cell line.Proteome Sci. 2013; 11: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar)), histone H4, and PCNA (supplemental Fig. S1B). We decided to focus on PCNA because it exhibited several unique peptides and high coverage (supplemental Fig. S1B). The association of IGF-1R with PCNA was confirmed using IP with anti-IGF-1R and reciprocal IP with anti-PCNA, followed by immunoblotting for PCNA and IGF-1R, respectively (Fig. 1C). Nuclear association was confirmed by co-IP after subcellular fractionation (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D) and in situ PLA of IGF-1R and PCNA (Fig. 1D). PLA showed clear signals abundantly located to the cell nuclei. Next, we used R+ and R− cells to support the association between IGF-1R and PCNA (Fig. 1E). Although R+ exhibited this association, R−, as expected, did not. The percentage of cells in S phase and the expression level of PCNA (control blot) were similar in the two cell lines (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). As the R+ cell line is a stable IGF1R transfectant produced from R− cells in the early 1990s (21Pietrzkowski Z. Sell C. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Baserga R. Roles of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and the IGF-1 receptor in epidermal growth factor-stimulated growth of 3T3 cells.Mol. Cell.

Constitutive expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor abrogates all requirements for exogenous growth factors.Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 199-205PubMed Google Scholar), we verified the observed IGF-1R/PCNA interaction in a newly transfected R− cell line (here denoted R-WT). R-EV represents empty vector control (supplemental Fig. S2C). Because R+ and R− cells provide an excellent cell system for comparison of the effect in the presence and absence of IGF-1R, they were used as lead and control cell lines for investigation of IGF-1R/PCNA-dependent events. Selected findings were validated on other human and mouse non-engineered cell lines, including hESC. IGF-1R is an established receptor tyrosine kinase in the cell membrane, but it was recently shown to exert kinase activity also in the cell nucleus by directly phosphorylating histone H3Y41 (4Warsito D. Lin Y. Gnirck A.C. Sehat B. Larsson O. Nuclearly translocated insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor phosphorylates histone H3 at tyrosine 41 and induces SNAI2 expression via Brg1 chromatin remodeling protein.Oncotarget. 2016; 7: 42288-42302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Consequently, we investigated whether nIGF-1R might phosphorylate PCNA. First, we compared PCNA tyrosine phosphorylation status in R+ with R− cells. IP of PCNA followed by detection of phosphotyrosine showed that PCNA is phosphorylated only in R+ and not in R− cells (Fig. 2A, top panel), as shown by several bands in R+ cells between 30 and 60 kDa. Reciprocal co-IP confirmed this finding (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). These results indicate that the expression of IGF-1R is necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of PCNA, but they do not determine whether this is mediated through the canonical IGF-1R signaling or directly by the nuclear receptor. To investigate whether IGF-1R phosphorylates PCNA directly, an in vitro kinase assay was used. As shown, recombinant IGF-1R kinase domain was able to tyrosine-phosphorylate recombinant PCNA (Fig. 2B). The presence or absence of ATP in the reactions was used as control. The specificity of IGF-1R phosphorylation was further confirmed by adding an IGF-1R inhibitor (NVP-AEW541) to the reaction (supplemental Fig. S3A). As a positive control for the IGF-1R kinase activity in vitro, we showed that it phosphorylated itself (a bona fide substrate) under such conditions (Fig. 3B). To identify the specific PCNA tyrosine residue(s) being phosphorylated by nIGF-1R, we utilized MS analysis of recombinant PCNA after in vitro phosphorylation by recombinant IGF-1R. Recombinant PCNA without IGF-1R was used as negative control. The result reveals that residues Tyr-60, Tyr-133, and Tyr-250 were phosphorylated by the IGF-1R kinase (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that IGF-1R is capable of directly phosphorylating PCNA, suggesting that PCNA is a substrate of the nuclear IGF-1R tyrosine kinase activity. To confirm these results, the potential function of the Tyr-60, Tyr-133, and Tyr-250 residues will be considered below. Nuclear epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has previously been reported to control PCNA stability through Tyr-211 phosphorylation (23Wang S.C. Nakajima Y. Yu Y.L. Xia W. Chen C.T. Yang C.C. McIntush E.W. Li L.Y. Hawke D.H. Kobayashi R. Hung M.C. Tyrosine phosphorylation controls PCNA function through protein stability.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To investigate whether IGF-1R-mediated PCNA phosphorylation affected PCNA stability, R+ cells were treated with either IGF-1 or NVP-AEW541 for 3 and 24 h. However, neither IGF-1R stimulation nor inhibition altered the PCNA levels (Fig. 2D). Additionally, R+ and R− cells showed similar PCNA levels. These data suggest that IGF-1R does not affect PCNA stability. Post-translational modification of PCNA by mono- and polyubiquitination has been shown to control various PCNA functions, including the DDT pathway (see Introduction). Using co-IP experiments, we observed mono- and polyubiquitinated PCNA in R+ but not in R− cells (Fig. 3A). To investigate the possible involvement of IGF-1R kinase activity in ubiquitination of PCNA, R+ cells were treated with either NVP-AEW541 or IGF-1 for 3 h, followed by immunoprecipitation of PCNA and detection of phosphotyrosine and ubiquitin. IGF-1 treatment clearly increased both PCNA phosphorylation and ubiquitination, whereas inhibition of IGF-1R reversed/decreased these effects (Fig. 3B). To confirm the nuclear function of IGF-1R in inducing PCNA phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination, PCNA from the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of R+ cells was pulled down using IP. As shown in supplemental Fig. S5, A and B, PCNA only from the nuclear fraction was tyrosine-phosphorylated and ubiquitinated. Further confirmation was achieved by using R-TSM cells (R− transfected with triple SUMO-site-mutated IGF-1R cell line). Just recently we showed that R-TSM cells exhibited diminished nuclear gene regulatory effects of IGF-1R while retaining IGF-1R kinase-dependent signaling (2Sehat B. Tofigh A. Lin Y. Trocmé E. Liljedahl U. Lagergren J. Larsson O. SUMOylation mediates the nuclear translocation and signaling of the IGF-1 receptor.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra10Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24Lin Y. Liu H. Waraky A. Haglund F. Agarwal P. Jernberg-Wiklund H. Warsito D. Larsson O. SUMO-modified insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) increases cell cycle progression and cell proliferation.J. Cell. Physiol. 2017; 232: 2722-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). IGF-1R from R+ and R-TSM was pulled down using IP, and equal amounts of it were subjected to in vitro kinase assay using recombinant PCNA as substrate (supplemental Fig. S4C). As shown, only IGF-1R from R-WT was able to phosphorylate PCNA (supplemental Fig. S4C). Incubation with TSM IGF-1R did not lead to any detectable phospho-PCNA signal. IP from R− was used as negative control. We then analyzed ubiquitination of PCNA in these cell lines. Only PCNA from R+ cells was phosphorylated and ubiquitinated (supplemental Fig. S4D). Taken together, the results suggest that nIGF-1R-induced phosphorylation of PCNA is involved in its ubiquitination. The inability of TSM IGF-1R to phosphorylate PCNA is in line with the observed decrease in phosphorylation of histone H3 in HeLa cells transfected with TSM IGF-1R (4Warsito D. Lin Y. Gnirck A.C. Sehat B. Larsson O. Nuclearly translocated insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor phosphorylates histone H3 at tyrosine 41 and induces SNAI2 expression via Brg1 chromatin remodeling protein.Oncotarget. 2016; 7: 42288-42302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the MAPK/ERK and the PI3K/Akt pathways using the inhibitors U0126 and LY2942002, respectively, did not decrease PCNA ubiquitination as compared with the untreated control (supplemental Fig. S5, A and B), which supports the notion that PCNA ubiquitination is mediated by nuclear IGF-1R and not by the canonical signaling of membrane IGF-1R. Mono- and polyubiquitinations of PCNA by RAD6 (E2)–RAD18 (E3) and UBC13 (E2)–SHPRH/HLTF (E3), respectively, have been shown to regulate PCNA function through the DDT pathway (9Chang D.J. Cimprich K.A. DNA damage tolerance: when it's OK to make mistakes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 10Friedberg E.C. Suffering in silence: the tolerance of DNA damage.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Using co-IP experiments, we showed the association of UBC13 (E2) and SHPRH/HLTF (E3) with PCNA in R+ but not R− cells (Fig. 3C). This suggests that nIGF-1R-dependent PCNA polyubiquitination may be mediated by these ligases. Similar results were also obtained for the monoubiquitin RAD18 (E3) ligase and the main TLS polymerase DNA polymerase η (Fig. 3C). As a control, the expression of ligases in whole-cell lysates was investigated by immunoblotting. Essentially similar levels are detected in R+ and R− cells (supplemental Fig. S6A). A separate experiment on the association of SHPRH, HTLF, and RAD18 with PCNA, and ligase expression in whole-cell lysates, is presented in supplemental Fig. S7A. This experiment also involved a random nuclear protein (i.e. p27), which did not co-IP with PCNA (supplemental Fig. S7A). IGF-1 stimulation increased the binding of SHPRH/HLTF, RAD18, and DNA polymerase η to PCNA, whereas inhibition with NVP-AWE541 decreased it (supplemental Fig. S7B). The importance of PCNA Tyr-60, Tyr-113, and Tyr-250 phosphorylation sites for IGF-1R/PCNA interaction and subsequent modifications was then investigated by site-specific mutations. R+ cells were transfected with eGFP-PCNA constructs representing either wild-type PCNA or mutated PCNA, resulting in a tyrosine replaced by a phenylalanine (Y60F, Y133F, Y250F or triply mutated Y60F/Y133F/Y250F, denoted Y-Tpl). Exogenous PCNA was pulled down using co-IP with anti-GFP. In contrast to the exogenous wild-type PCNA, all four mutants abolished the IGF-1R/interaction, PCNA phosphorylation and ubiquitination, as well as binding of SHPRH/HLTF and RAD18 ligases (Fig. 3D). This suggests that phosphorylation of all three tyrosine residues is necessary for the nIGF-1R/PCNA interaction. Control blots of ligase expression in lysates of the transfected cells are shown in supplemental Fig. S6B. Together with our findings that IGF-1R associates with PCNA in cell nuclei (Fig. 1), and has the capacity to directly phosphorylate PCNA (Fig. 2; supplemental Fig. S3), it appears that the nucleus-localized receptor serves as the kinase and thereby triggers the subsequent ubiquitination. To verify the functional role of mutated PCNA constructs in DNA replication, we investigated GFP-gated Y-Tpl in R+ cells by FACS analysis after BrdU/DAPI labeling. Upon synchronization by serum starvation, the cells were released and analyzed at different time points (0–20 h). As shown in supplemental Fig. S8, the cells progressed from G1 to and through the S phase. After 20 h, many cells reentered the G1 phase. Similar results were seen for the other (single mutated) eGFP-PCNA transfected cell lines (data not shown). Because PCNA ubiquitination has been coupled to the DDT pathway mainly after DNA damage that induced replication fork stalling, we next sought to explore the potential role of nIGF-1R-mediated PCNA ubiquitination in response to UV treatment. R+ and R− cells were exposed to UV irradiation, 30 mJ/cm2, for 30 s, followed by a 1-h exposure-free incubation. PCNA in R− cells did not exhibit any ubiquitination in response to UV irradiation (Fig. 4A). Conversely, the base-line ubiquitination of PCNA in R+ cells was increased substantially by UV light, but it was attenuated if NVP-AWE541 was added prior to the irradiation (Fig. 4A). Similarly, R+ cells showed a strong induction of PCNA ubiquitination after treatment with the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (supplemental Fig. S9). This effect was abolished by IGF-1R inhibition. Thus, DNA damage-induced ubiquitination of PCNA was dependent on IGF-1R activity. Our next step was to investigate the role of IGF-1R in the DDT pathway. One method for assessing the efficiency of the DDT pathways is to measure the speed of replication restart after induction of DNA damage. This measures the cell’s ability to tolerate DNA damage upon encountering polymerase-blocking lesions. To assess the functional role of IGF-1R in the DDT pathway, we applied the DNA fiber-labeling method to measure replication fork progression after MMS-induced DNA damage in R+ and R− cells. Briefly, cells were incubated with two different halogenated nucleotides, chlorodeoxyuridine (CidU) and iododeoxyuridine (IdU), which are incorporated into nascent DNA at replication forks before and after inducing DNA damage by MMS as schematically shown in Fig. 4B. The speed of DNA replication restart was estimated as the IdU/CidU ratios of the lengths of labeled nascent replication tracts before (CidU) and after (IdU) induction of DNA damage. MMS treatment delayed DNA replication by 60% in R+ cells and by as much as 90% in R− cells (Fig. 4C). Thus, R+ cells have a more efficient DDT pathway than R− cells. To further characterize the role of IGF-1R in the DDT pathway we used FACS analysis, after BrdU/PI labeling, to determine the effect of DNA damage upon cell cycle progression. R+ and R− cells were synchronized by serum depletion and then treated with MMS or DMSO (control) for 6 h. Upon serum repletion, the R+ and R− control cells progressed through the cell cycle (Fig. 5, A and B). Treatment with MMS slowed down the cell cycle progression only in R+ cells (Fig. 5, A and B). No increase in the percentage of cells in G1 was seen in R+ cells. In R− cells, MMS treatment substantially inhibited cell cycle progression by inducing G1-cell cycle arrest, decreasing the number of cells in S phase, and almost blocking the progression of cells into the G2 phase (Fig. 5, A and B). Further support for this response was obtained using unsynchronized cells. R+ and R− cells were pulse-labeled with BrdU for 1 h, followed by treatment with DMSO or MMS for 6 h (Fig. 5C). The BrdU-labeled cells were then gated (green dots), and the progression of the gated cells through S phase after treatment was investigated. In a pattern that was basically similar to that in synchronized cells, the R+ cells were able to progress from the G1/S phase to the S/G2 phase at a slower rate after MMS treatment, whereas R− cells collapsed in the G1/S phase, with minimal cell progression toward the S/G2 phase. To further investigate the role of IGF-1R in DDT, we analyzed the connection between IGF-1R activity and PCNA phosphorylation in cells entering the S phase. We used the same experimental condition as described in Fig. 5, A and B. Serum-starved R+ and R− cells were re-stimulated for 12 h for maximal S phase synchronization (supplemental Fig. S10A). We first investigated S phase cells under spontaneous fork stalling (i.e. without DNA damage exposures). After IP of PCNA, IGF-1R, p-Tyr, and PCNA were detected (supplemental Fig. S10B). In serum-starved R+ cells (indicated as G1), there was a slight IGF-1R/PCNA interaction and no PCNA phosphorylation. In contrast, R+ cells in S phase (indicated as S) showed a much stronger association between IGF-1R and PCNA as well as a clear PCNA phosphorylation. However, upon addition of NVP-AEW541, p-Tyr PCNA was almost deleted (supplemental Fig. S10B). No PCNA phosphorylation was seen in R− cells. Next, we investigated S phase cells under condition of fork stalling collapse, as induced by a 6-h MMS treatment (cf. Fig. 5, A and B). As shown in supplemental Fig. S10C, MMS treatment drastically increased phosphorylation of PCNA as compared with the negative controls. Simultaneous treatment with the IGF-1R inhibitor abrogated the MMS-induced response. No effects were observed in R− cells (supplemental Fig. S10C). These data support a role IGF-1R in DDT through phosphorylation of PCNA. The cell lines SNL (an MEF cell line) and Gm02808 (human fibroblasts) were compared with hESC and R+/R− cells. Similar to hESC and R+, the IGF-1R–PCNA complex was detected in SNL and GM02808 (Fig. 6A). They all exhibited PCNA phosphorylation and ubiquitination in a pattern similar to R+"

The ING family of epigenetic regulators (ING1-5) function by targeting histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or histone deacetylase complexes to the H3K4me3 mark to alter histone acetylation and subsequently, gene expression. Here we find that ectopic expression of ING5, the targeting subunit of HBO1, MOZ and MORF HAT complexes increases expression of the Oct4, Olig2 and Nestin stem cell markers, promotes self-renewal, prevents lineage differentiation and increases stem cell pools in BTIC populations. This activity requires the plant homeodomain region of ING5 that interacts specifically with the H3K4me3 mark. ING5 also enhances PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK activity to sustain self-renewal of BTICs over serial passage of stem cell-like spheres. ING5 exerts these effects by activating transcription of calcium channel and follicle stimulating hormone pathway genes. In silico analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas data suggest that ING5 is a positive regulator of BTIC stemness, whose expression negatively correlates with patient prognosis, especially in the Proneural and Classical subtypes, and in tumors with low SOX2 expression. These data suggest that altering histone acetylation status and signaling pathways induced by ING5 may provide useful clinical strategies to target tumor resistance and recurrence in glioblastoma."

The maintenance of cellular integrity is one of the most crucial factors in cell survival. All cell types, from unicellular to those in multicellular organisms, possess a robust and well-evolved mechanism to address environmental stress. Response to such stress requires a complex network of sensing and signal transduction mechanisms that include transcriptional regulation of genes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two closely related transcription factors named Msn2 and Msn4 (multicopy suppressor of SNF1 mutation proteins 2 and 4) are master regulators of stress-responsive gene expression (1Estruch F.

Regulation of stress-responsive genes is critically dependent on the translocation of Msn2/Msn4 from the cytosol to the nucleus. Msn2 is distributed in the cytosol under glucose-rich conditions or in cells in log phase, whereas a sudden depletion in glucose or stress results in predominant nuclear localization (4Görner W. Durchschlag E. Wolf J. Brown E.L. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Schüller C. Acute glucose starvation activates the nuclear localization signal of a stress-specific yeast transcription factor.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae invokes evolutionarily conserved glucose sensing and signaling pathways to adopt such changes within the nutritional environment (5Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Glucose-sensing and signalling mechanisms in yeast.FEMS Yeast Res. 2002; 2: 183-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with two major pathways that mediate glucose signaling. Snf1, a serine/threonine protein kinase-dependent pathway that is activated under glucose-limited conditions, promotes induction of glucose-repressed genes (6Papamichos-Chronakis M. Gligoris T. Tzamarias D. The Snf1 kinase controls glucose repression in yeast by modulating interactions between the Mig1 repressor and the Cyc8-Tup1 co-repressor.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The other pathway, the cAMP-dependent PKA pathway, is activated by cAMP in response to elevated glucose levels. In addition to playing crucial roles in cell cycle progression and energy metabolism, the PKA pathway has been established as the major regulator of metabolic reprogramming in regulation of environmental stress responses (7Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Nuclear localization of the C2H2 zinc finger protein Msn2p is regulated by stress and protein kinase A activity.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The Msn2/Msn4-mediated stress response is negatively regulated by cAMP-dependent PKA (7Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C.

Yeast PKA represses Msn2p/Msn4p-dependent gene expression to regulate growth, stress response and glycogen accumulation.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and PKA-mediated stress resistance is due to localization of Msn2 in the nucleus, where it promotes transcription of stress-inducible genes (4Görner W. Durchschlag E. Wolf J. Brown E.L. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Schüller C. Acute glucose starvation activates the nuclear localization signal of a stress-specific yeast transcription factor.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, activated PKA prevents nuclear localization of Msn2 via phosphorylation, which ultimately leads to inhibition of the general stress response (9Norbeck J. Blomberg A. The level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A activity strongly affects osmotolerance and osmo-instigated gene expression changes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 2000; 16: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The regulatory role of Msn2/Msn4 has also been implicated in the conserved target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway, which regulates multiple cellular processes in response to nutrient stress, such as from nitrogen, carbon, and amino acids (10Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Elucidating TOR signaling and rapamycin action: lessons from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Inhibition of TOR signaling in yeast and many other organisms leads to increased longevity and enhanced stress responses caused by nuclear accumulation of Msn2/Msn4 (11Medvedik O. Lamming D.W. Kim K.D. Sinclair D.A. MSN2 and MSN4 link calorie restriction and TOR to sirtuin-mediated lifespan extension in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLos Biol. 2007; 5: e261Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Cells increase peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation under low-glucose or stationary-phase conditions (12Skoneczny M. Rytka J.

The significance of peroxisome function in chronological aging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Aging Cell. 2013; 12: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Based on the available data, it is clear that Msn2/Msn4 localizes predominantly to the nucleus under low-glucose or stress (oxidative, heat, and osmotic) conditions (4Görner W. Durchschlag E. Wolf J. Brown E.L. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Schüller C.

PP2A phosphatase activity is required for stress and Tor kinase regulation of yeast stress response factor Msn2p.Eukaryotic Cell. 2004; 3: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, Msn2/Msn4 localization during growth on non-favorable carbon sources, such as oleate, galactose, and glycerol, has not been studied to date. Maintenance of cells under low-glucose or stress conditions requires energy. Based on the findings cited above, it is clear that Msn2/Msn4 may have crucial roles in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and in cell survival during conditions of low glucose or stress, in addition to their functions in regulating the TOR and PKA pathways. However, the exact regulatory mechanism is not known. Because fatty acid catabolism through β-oxidation provides an alternative source of ATP production in response to low-glucose or stationary-phase conditions, it can be hypothesized that Msn2/Msn4 may play a role in fatty acid metabolism under glucose-limiting or stationary-phase conditions. In the present study, we report that the stress response transcription factors Msn2/Msn4 positively regulate β-oxidation genes under stationary-phase conditions in S. cerevisiae. Msn2/Msn4 play a vital role in management of fatty acid toxicity and in peroxisome development. Furthermore, by utilizing the msn2Δmsn4Δ mutant and single-deletion strains of genes involved in peroxisome biogenesis and function, we show that triacylglycerol (TAG) and steryl ester (SE) accumulate to avoid fatty acid toxicity. In silico analysis of the promoter sequences of genes involved in peroxisome biogenesis and function was performed using the pattern match tool from the Saccharomyces Genome Database. Our analysis revealed the presence of the Msn2/Msn4/STRE, a 5′-AGGGG/GGGGA (2Stewart-Ornstein J. Nelson C. DeRisi J. Weissman J.S. El-Samad H.

These analyses revealed that Msn2 and Msn4 may regulate these genes under glucose-limiting conditions.Table 1Peroxisome genes have Msn2/Msn4-binding site at promoter regionS no.Systematic nameGene nameSTRE element (at −10−3 to −1 bp)1YDR216WADR1−1902YAL051WOAF1−6063YIL160CPOT1−1824YGL205WPOX1−2855YKR009CFOX2−1206YLR284CECI1−4337YNL202WSPS19−1938YOR180CDCI1−3819YKL197CPEX1−39610YJL210WPEX2−75911YDR244WPEX5−31712YNL329CPEX6−45413YDR142CPEX7−13414YLR191WPEX13−97115YNL214WPEX17−32416YHR160CPEX18−37817YDL065CPEX19−29818YAL055WPEX22−89119YPL112CPEX25−63320YHR150WPEX28−53521YDR479CPEX29−85922YGR004WPEX31−40223YBR168WPEX32−80424YCL056CPEX34−85825YPL147WPXA1−46126YKL188CPXA2−26427YJR104CSOD1−21828YHR008CSOD2−7629YER015WFAA2−59730YMR246WFAA4−89031YML042WCAT2−74632YDR256CCTA1−82033YCR005CCIT2−47334YNL009WIDP3−81235YLR151CPCD1−16636YFL030WAGX1−79637YNL242WATG2−74338YIL146CATG32−17739YML054CCYB2−39740YIR004WDJP1−98141YIL065CFIS1−88842YDL022WGPD1−21043YGR154CGTO1−76044YIR034CLYS1−84545YDR234WLYS4−39846YDL078CMDH3−81447YNL117WMLS1−54348YBR222CPCS60−7049YGL037CPNC1−10050YPR165WRHO1−63851YLR389CSTE23−61152YGL184CSTR3−75653YJR019CTES1−59354YKR001CVPS1−797 Open table in a new tab To examine the carbon source-dependent localization of Msn2, an Msn2-GFP fusion construct was generated, and expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A). Nuclear localization of Msn2-GFP was confirmed by staining the cells with DAPI (Fig. 1B). Msn2 localization was also monitored on different sole carbon sources, such as glucose, oleate, galactose, and glycerol, whereby cells grown to different time points were subjected to confocal microscopy. We observed that Msn2-GFP was uniformly distributed in the cytosol at 0 h and in early log-phase conditions in cells grown with glucose, whereas in the stationary phase, it was concentrated in the nucleus (Fig. 1C). In cells grown with oleate, galactose, and glycerol, Msn2-GFP was localized only in the nucleus, irrespective of time point (Fig. 1, D–F). These experiments reveal that glucose limitation (stationary phase) or the presence of a non-favorable carbon source leads to translocation of Msn2 from the cytosol to the nucleus. Wild-type, msn2Δ, msn4Δ, and msn2Δmsn4Δ cells were grown on a medium containing 1 mm oleate and 0.5% glucose or a medium containing only 1 mm oleate as the sole carbon source. The msn2Δmsn4Δ cells showed a severe growth defect on solid agar medium containing 1 mm oleate and 0.5% glucose compared with that containing 2% glucose as the sole carbon source. In contrast, no growth was observed on the medium containing oleate as the sole carbon source (Fig. 2A). However, compared with wild-type cells, msn2Δ and msn4Δ strains did not show any significant growth defects under the same conditions. Similar results were obtained when the growth experiment was performed using a liquid medium (Fig. 2B). These experiments suggest a possible role for Msn2/Msn4 in fatty acid metabolism. Translocation of Msn2/Msn4 from the cytosol to the nucleus is a stress response mechanism (7Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Nuclear localization of the C2H2 zinc finger protein Msn2p is regulated by stress and protein kinase A activity.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We performed real-time PCR analysis to evaluate the transcript levels of MSN2 and MSN4 under glucose limitation, which was carried out in WT cells grown for 15 h on 2% (normal) and 6% glucose (high glucose). Our results showed that the expression levels of MSN2 and MSN4 increased up to 8.8- and 5.5-fold, respectively, in cells grown on 2% glucose compared with those grown on 6% glucose (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that the stress regulatory mechanism of Msn2/Msn4 occurs via both their translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus and an increase in their transcript levels. Fatty acid β-oxidation is an evolutionarily conserved process that is reported to occur in the stationary phase of yeast cells when glucose is exhausted from the medium (13Lefevre S.D. van Roermund C.W. Wanders R.J. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. The significance of peroxisome function in chronological aging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Aging Cell. 2013; 12: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increased transcript levels of MSN2 and MSN4, nuclear localization of Msn2 in different carbon sources, and the inability of msn2Δmsn4Δ strain to grow on medium containing oleate as the sole carbon source led us to predict a role for these factors in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. Accordingly, we performed real-time PCR analysis to assess the expression levels of major genes involved in β-oxidation pathways (Fig. 3B) (16Geisbrecht B.V. Zhu D. Schulz K. Nau K. Morrell J.C. Geraghty M. Schulz H. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. Molecular characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Δ3, Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase.J. Biol.

We observed that glucose limitation resulted in increased expression of ECI1, POT1, FOX2, POX1, and SPS19 in WT cells. Single deletion of MSN2 caused a decrease in the expression level of these genes compared with WT cells. However, the expression levels of these genes in msn2Δmsn4Δ cells were extremely low, with no increase under glucose limitation (Fig. 3B). Peroxisome proliferation and function are known to occur in the stationary phase (13Lefevre S.D. van Roermund C.W. Wanders R.J. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. The significance of peroxisome function in chronological aging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Aging Cell. 2013; 12: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated the expression levels of genes involved in peroxisome biogenesis (PEX1 to PEX11 and PEX 19), fatty acid transporters (PXA1 and PXA2), and peroxisome lipase (LPX1) (18Gould S.J. Collins C.S. Peroxisomal-protein import: is it really that complex?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Smith J.J. Aitchison J.D.

Chem. 2012; 287: 20144-20153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in the msn2Δmsn4Δ mutant grown to the stationary phase. Overall, expression of genes related to peroxisome biogenesis (PEX1, PEX4, PEX10, PEX11, and PEX19) decreased in msn2Δmsn4Δ (Fig. 3C). Although the level of PXA1 expression was significantly low, no significant change was observed in the level of PXA2. Expression of the peroxisome lipase gene LPX1 was also low in the double mutant. Such decreased expression levels of genes involved in the β-oxidation pathway and peroxisome biogenesis and fatty acid transporters further strengthen the evidence that Msn2/Msn4 transcription factors play an important role under glucose-limitation conditions. It has been shown that Msn2 and Msn4 bind to a conserved STRE site present in the promoters of their target genes. Pattern match tool (Saccharomyces Genome Database) analysis of the promoter sequences of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism revealed the presence of an STRE site for Msn2/Msn4 (Fig. 4A). To evaluate Msn2 occupancy on the promoter region of the genes ECI1, FOX2, POT1, POX1, and SPS19, a ChIP assay was performed in WT cells harboring pvt100U-MSN2-GFP and grown on 2 and 6% glucose for 15 h. The data revealed that Msn2 occupied the promoter regions of these genes under glucose-depleted conditions (Fig. 4B). In addition, relative binding was more intense in 2% glucose-grown cells than in 6% glucose-grown cells (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that Msn2 occupies STREs of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism under glucose-limitation conditions. In addition to promoter occupancy, a β-galactosidase assay was performed to determine the in vivo effect of Msn2 on the expression of major genes involved in β-oxidation (ECI1, FOX2, POT1, POX1, and SPS19). WT, msn2Δ, and msn2Δmsn4Δ cells harboring YEp357-ECI1pro, YEp357-FOX2pro, YEp357-POT1pro, YEp357-POX1pro, and YEp357-SPS19pro were grown to the stationary phase in SM−URA medium containing 2% glucose. We observed that the β-galactosidase activities of ECI1 (1.2-fold), FOX2 (4.4-fold), POT1 (1.6-fold), POX1 (2.1-fold), and SPS19 (1.8-fold)-expressing cells were lower for the msn2Δmsn4Δ mutant compared with WT and the msn2Δ mutant (Fig. 5, B–F, bottom panels). These results suggest that Msn2 positively regulates expression of these genes. To visualize DNA–protein interactions in vitro, bacterially expressed recombinant Msn2 and Msn4 were purified and confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). Because Msn2 and Msn4 are homologous, we performed EMSA with the Msn4-His-tagged protein and 1000-bp promoter fragments of five major β-oxidation pathway genes (ECI1, FOX2, POT1, POX1, and SPS19). An increase in the DNA-protein complex was observed with an increasing amount of protein (Fig. 5, B–F, top panels). We did not observe any DNA–protein complex with DGA1 promoter and Msn4, which was used as a negative control (data not shown). Our results clearly show that Msn4 interacts effectively with the promoter region of these β-oxidation genes. Defective fatty acid metabolism causes lipotoxicity in yeast (21Lockshon D. Surface L.E. Kerr E.O. Kaeberlein M. Kennedy B.K. The sensitivity of yeast mutants to oleic acid implicates the peroxisome and other processes in membrane function.Genetics. 2007; 175: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, acylation of free fatty acids into nonpolar lipids, such as TAG and SE, is a defense mechanism to avoid toxicity (22Kohlwein S.D. Triacylglycerol homeostasis: insights from yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15663-15667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we analyzed the nonpolar lipid profile of WT, msn2Δ, msn4Δ, and msn2Δmsn4Δ cells grown up to stationary phase in 2% (Fig. 6A) and 0.5% (Fig. 6B) glucose followed by relative quantification of TAG and SE. WT, msn2Δ, and msn4Δ cells were used as the controls. We observed that the msn2Δmsn4Δ mutant showed a prominent accumulation of TAG and SE compared with WT, msn2Δ, and msn4Δ (Fig. 6, A and B). Because TAG and SE are stored in the form of cytoplasmic lipid droplets, we further validated the increase in TAG and SE by staining the lipid droplets with BODIPYTM 493/503 stain and viewing the cells under a confocal microscope. The data showed an increase in the number of lipid droplets in msn2Δmsn4Δ mutant cells compared with WT (Fig. 6, C and D). In yeast, the peroxisome is the site of fatty acid metabolism. To validate the function of MSN2 and MSN4 in fatty acid oxidation, we also analyzed the nonpolar lipid profile of single deletions of genes involved in peroxisome biogenesis, function, and regulation. All deletion strains were grown in 2% glucose to the stationary phase; relative quantification of TAG and SE was performed and was compared with WT cells. Similar to msn2Δmsn4Δ cells, the deletion mutants pex1Δ, pex4Δ, pex5Δ, pex10Δ, pex3Δ, pex11Δ, pex25Δ, pex27Δ, pxa1Δ, pex14Δ, pex15Δ, pex18Δ, pex21Δ, pex22Δ, pex29Δ, and pex31Δ showed accumulation of TAG and SE compared with WT (Fig. 7A). Additionally, the fatty acid transporter mutant pxa1Δ also showed accumulation of TAG and SE but no change in pxa2Δ (Fig. 7A). Strains deleted for peroxisome function, namely dci1Δ, eci1Δ, fox1Δ, pot1Δ, sps19Δ, and ctt1Δ, also accumulated TAG and SE compared with WT (Fig. 7B). Similar to the msn2Δmsn4Δ mutant, oaf1Δ and snf1Δ showed significant increases in TAG and SE levels (Fig. 7C). We performed an immunofluorescence assay using confocal microscopy for the visualization of peroxisomes with anti-PMP 70 (peroxisomal membrane protein 70) antibodies in WT and msn2Δmsn4Δ cells grown to the stationary phase in 2% glucose (Fig. 8, A and B). Our results showed a relatively low number of peroxisomes in the msn2Δmsn4Δ mutant compared with WT cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Msn2 and Msn4 regulate fatty acid metabolism in budding yeast. We performed the RFP-PTS1 localization in WT and msn2Δmsn4Δ mutant cells grown up to stationary phase in 2% glucose. The cells were observed under a confocal microscope for the visualization of peroxisomes (Fig. 8, C and D). Our result showed that the number of peroxisomes in msn2Δmsn4Δ strain were less than WT cells. These data suggested that Msn2 and Msn4 may have a regulatory effect on peroxisome in budding yeast. In the present study, we demonstrated the novel function of stress regulatory transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 in fatty acid metabolism under glucose-limiting or stationary-phase conditions. Glucose is the preferred carbon source for S. cerevisiae and is required for exponential cell division. Glucose depletion halts yeast cell division and allows them to enter into the diauxic shift, followed by the stationary phase. Our study provides evidence for the role of Msn2 and Msn4 in maintaining energy homeostasis during carbon source starvation stress via regulation of the induction of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. The results of this study provide clear evidence that Msn2p/Msn4 positively regulates expression of genes involved in β-oxidation pathways in response to the low-glucose conditions that occur during the stationary phase of growth. The Msn2/Msn4 nuclear localization signal is a direct target of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (4Görner W. Durchschlag E. Wolf J. Brown E.L. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Schüller C. Acute glucose starvation activates the nuclear localization signal of a stress-specific yeast transcription factor.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and cAMP levels increase in a glucose-dependent manner, serving as a common indicator for glucose, nitrogen, and phosphate depletion in yeast (23Conway M.K.

Glucose, nitrogen, and phosphate repletion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: common transcriptional responses to different nutrient signals.G3 (Bethesda). 2012; 2: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In yeast, peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation occurs during the postdiauxic phase (24Casanovas A. Sprenger R.R. Tarasov K. Ruckerbauer D.E. Hannibal-Bach H.K. Zanghellini J. Jensen O.N.

Biol. 2015; 22: 412-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or during chronological aging, and fatty acid transporters are up-regulated to direct fatty acids toward β-oxidation (13Lefevre S.D. van Roermund C.W.

The significance of peroxisome function in chronological aging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Aging Cell. 2013; 12: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Increased levels of MSN2 and MSN4 transcripts in WT cells, the rapid translocation of Msn2-GFP from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to low glucose and the consistent localization of Msn2-GFP in the nucleus in the presence of non-favorable carbon sources further strengthen our hypothesis. Deletion of both MSN2 and MSN4 causes a reduction in the transcript levels of genes involved in peroxisome biogenesis and function. However, fatty acid β-oxidation is important for a cell to maintain fatty acid homeostasis, and excess free fatty acids are toxic (25Carballeira N. New advances in fatty acids as antimalarial, antimycobacterial and antifungal agents.Prog. Lipid Res. 2008; 47: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Indeed, strains defective in fatty acid metabolism and peroxisome biogenesis are unable to grow on oleate or fatty acid-supplemented medium (21Lockshon D. Surface L.E. Kerr E.O. Kaeberlein M.

https://openalex.org/W2755466223,"Induced mutagenesis was employed to create genetic variation in the lentil cultivars for yield improvement. The assessments were made on genetic variability, character association, and genetic divergence among the twelve mutagenized populations and one parent population of each of the two lentil cultivars, developed by single and combination treatments with gamma rays and hydrazine hydrates. Analysis of variance revealed significant inter-population differences for the observed quantitative phenotypic traits. The sample mean of six treatment populations in each of the cultivar exhibited highly superior quantitative phenotypic traits compared to their parent cultivars. The higher values of heritability and genetic advance with a high genotypic coefficient of variation for most of the yield attributing traits confirmed the possibilities of lentil yield improvement through phenotypic selection. The number of pods and seeds per plant appeared to be priority traits in selection for higher yield due to their strong direct association with yield. The cluster analysis divided the total populations into three divergent groups in each lentil cultivar with parent genotypes in an independent group showing the high efficacy of the mutagens. Considering the highest contribution of yield trait to the genetic divergence among the clustered population, it was confirmed that the mutagenic treatments created a wide heritable variation for the trait in the mutant populations. The selection of high yielding mutants from the mutant populations of DPL 62 (100 Gy) and Pant L 406 (100Gy + 0.1% HZ) in the subsequent generation is expected to give elite lentil cultivars. Also, hybridization between members of the divergent group would produce diverse segregants for crop improvement. Apart from this, the induced mutations at loci controlling economically important traits in the selected high yielding mutants have successfully contributed in diversifying the accessible lentil genetic base and will definitely be of immense value to the future lentil breeding programmes in India."

The platelet-binding A1 domain of VWF is connected to the VWF N-terminally located D′D3 domain through a relatively unstructured amino acid sequence, called here the N-terminal linker. This region has previously been shown to inhibit the binding of VWF to the platelet surface receptor glycoprotein Ibα (GpIbα). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory function of the N-terminal linker has not been elucidated. Here, we show that an aspartate at position 1261 is the most critical residue of the N-terminal linker for inhibiting binding of the VWF A1 domain to GpIbα on platelets in blood flow. Through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, mutagenesis, and A1–GpIbα binding experiments, we identified a network of salt bridges between Asp1261 and the rest of A1 that lock the N-terminal linker in place such that it reduces binding to GpIbα. Mutations aimed at disrupting any of these salt bridges activated binding unless the mutated residue also formed a salt bridge with GpIbα, in which case the mutations inhibited the binding. These results show that interactions between charged amino acid residues are important both to directly stabilize the A1–GpIbα complex and to indirectly destabilize the complex through the N-terminal linker."

Here, we used identifiable neurons in a neurobiological model system, the mollusc Aplysia, to study neuropeptides, a diverse class of neuromodulators. We took advantage of two types of feeding neurons, B48 and B1/B2, in the Aplysia buccal ganglion that might contain different neuropeptides. We performed a representational difference analysis (RDA) by subtraction of mRNAs in B48 versus mRNAs in B1/B2. The RDA identified an unusually long (2025 amino acids) peptide precursor encoding Aplysia leucokinin-like peptides (ALKs; e.g. ALK-1 and ALK-2). Northern blot analysis revealed that, compared with other ganglia (e.g. the pedal-pleural ganglion), ALK mRNA is predominantly present in the buccal ganglion, which controls feeding behavior. We then used in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to localize ALKs to specific neurons, including B48. MALDI-TOF MS on single buccal neurons revealed expression of 40 ALK precursor–derived peptides. Among these, ALK-1 and ALK-2 are active in the feeding network; they shortened the radula protraction phase of feeding motor programs triggered by a command-like neuron. We also found that this effect may be mediated by the ALK-stimulated enhancement of activity of an interneuron, which has previously been shown to terminate protraction. We conclude that our multipronged approach is effective for determining the structure and defining the diverse functions of leucokinin-like peptides. Notably, the ALK precursor is the first verified nonarthropod precursor for leucokinin-like peptides with a novel, marked modulatory effect on a specific parameter (protraction duration) of feeding motor programs.

https://openalex.org/W2952640964,"The family of TGF-β and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling proteins has numerous developmental and physiological roles. They are made as proprotein dimers and then cleaved by proprotein convertases to release the C-terminal domain as an active ligand dimer. Multiple proteolytic processing sites in Glass bottom boat (Gbb), the Drosophila BMP7 ortholog, can produce distinct ligand forms. Cleavage at the S1 or atypical S0 site in Gbb produces Gbb15, the conventional small BMP ligand, whereas NS site cleavage produces a larger Gbb38 ligand. We hypothesized that the Gbb prodomain is involved not only in regulating the production of specific ligands but also their signaling output. We found that blocking NS cleavage increased association of the full-length prodomain with Gbb15, resulting in a concomitant decrease in signaling activity. Moreover, NS cleavage was required in vivo for Gbb-Decapentaplegic (Dpp) heterodimer-mediated wing vein patterning but not for Gbb15-Dpp heterodimer activity in cell culture. Gbb NS cleavage was also required for viability through its regulation of pupal ecdysis in a type II receptor Wishful thinking (Wit)-dependent manner. In fact, Gbb38-mediated signaling exhibits a preference for Wit over the other type II receptor Punt. Finally, we discovered that Gbb38 is produced when processing at the S1/S0 site is blocked by O-linked glycosylation in third instar larvae. Our findings demonstrate that BMP prodomain cleavage ensures that the mature ligand is not inhibited by the prodomain. Furthermore, alternative processing of BMP proproteins produces ligands that signal through different receptors and exhibit specific developmental functions."

https://openalex.org/W2754814480,"Highly expressed in cancer protein 1 (Hec1) is a subunit of the kinetochore (KT)-associated Ndc80 complex, which ensures proper segregation of sister chromatids at mitosis by mediating the interaction between KTs and microtubules (MTs). HEC1 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in many malignancies as part of a signature of chromosome instability. These properties render Hec1 a promising molecular target for developing therapeutic drugs that exert their anticancer activities by producing massive chromosome aneuploidy. A virtual screening study aimed at identifying small molecules able to bind at the Hec1–MT interaction domain identified one positive hit compound and two analogs of the hit with high cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic and anti-mitotic activities. The most cytotoxic analog (SM15) was shown to produce chromosome segregation defects in cancer cells by inhibiting the correction of erroneous KT–MT interactions. Live cell imaging of treated cells demonstrated that mitotic arrest and segregation abnormalities lead to cell death through mitotic catastrophe and that cell death occurred also from interphase. Importantly, SM15 was shown to be more effective in inducing apoptotic cell death in cancer cells as compared to normal ones and effectively reduced tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Mechanistically, cold-induced MT depolymerization experiments demonstrated a hyper-stabilization of both mitotic and interphase MTs. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate this finding by showing that SM15 can bind the MT surface independently from Hec1 and acts as a stabilizer of both MTs and KT–MT interactions. Overall, our studies represent a clear proof of principle that MT-Hec1-interacting compounds may represent novel powerful anticancer agents."

ECs from LAL-deficient (lal−/−) mice possess enhanced proliferation, migration, and permeability of inflammatory cells by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Here we report that lal−/− ECs facilitated in vivo tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis, largely by stimulating tumor cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and transendothelial migration via increased expression of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). This prompted us to look for lysosomal proteins that are involved in lal−/− EC dysfunctions. We found that lal−/− ECs displayed increased expression of Rab7, a late endosome/lysosome-associated small GTPase. Moreover, Rab7 and mTOR were co-increased and co-localized to lysosomes and physically interacted in lal−/− ECs. Rab7 inhibition reversed lal−/− EC dysfunctions, including decreasing their enhanced migration and permeability of tumor-stimulatory myeloid cells, and suppressed EC-mediated stimulation of in vitro tumor cell transmigration, proliferation, and migration and in vivo tumor growth and metastasis. Finally, Rab7 inhibition reduced overproduction of reactive oxygen species and increased IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion in lal−/− ECs.

https://openalex.org/W2754372698,"Proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases are highly pleiomorphic and may adopt an all-α-helical fold in one environment, assemble into all-β-sheet or collapse into a coil in another, and rapidly polymerize in yet another one via divergent aggregation pathways that yield broad diversity of aggregates’ morphology. A thorough understanding of this behaviour may be necessary to develop a treatment for Alzheimer’s and related disorders. Unfortunately, our present comprehension of folding and misfolding is limited for want of a physicochemical theory of protein secondary and tertiary structure. Here we demonstrate that electronic configuration and hyperconjugation of the peptide amide bonds ought to be taken into account to advance such a theory. To capture the effect of polarization of peptide linkages on conformational and H-bonding propensity of the polypeptide backbone, we introduce a function of shielding tensors of the Cα atoms. Carrying no information about side chain-side chain interactions, this function nonetheless identifies basic features of the secondary and tertiary structure, establishes sequence correlates of the metamorphic and pH-driven equilibria, relates binding affinities and folding rate constants to secondary structure preferences, and manifests common patterns of backbone density distribution in amyloidogenic regions of Alzheimer’s amyloid β and tau, Parkinson’s α-synuclein and prions. Based on those findings, a split-intein like mechanism of molecular recognition is proposed to underlie dimerization of Aβ, tau, αS and PrPC, and divergent pathways for subsequent association of dimers are outlined; a related mechanism is proposed to underlie formation of PrPSc fibrils. The model does account for: (i) structural features of paranuclei, off-pathway oligomers, non-fibrillar aggregates and fibrils; (ii) effects of incubation conditions, point mutations, isoform lengths, small-molecule assembly modulators and chirality of solid-liquid interface on the rate and morphology of aggregation; (iii) fibril-surface catalysis of secondary nucleation; and (iv) self-propagation of infectious strains of mammalian prions."
https://openalex.org/W2754456728,"Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract. Progesterone (P4) has been used for several decades in endometrial cancer treatment, especially in women who wish to retain fertility. However, it is unpredictable which patients will respond to P4 treatment and which may have a P4-resistant cancer. Therefore, identifying the mechanism of P4 resistance is essential to improve the therapies for endometrial cancer. Mitogen-inducible gene 6 (Mig-6) is a critical mediator of progesterone receptor (PGR) action in the uterus. In order to study the function of Mig-6 in P4 resistance, we generated a mouse model in which we specifically ablated Mig-6 in uterine epithelial cells using Sprr2f-cre mice (Sprr2fcre+Mig-6f/f). Female mutant mice develop endometrial hyperplasia due to aberrant phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and proliferation of the endometrial epithelial cells. The results from our immunoprecipitation and cell culture experiments showed that MIG-6 inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 via protein interactions. Our previous study showed P4 resistance in mice with Mig-6 ablation in Pgr-positive cells (Pgrcre/+Mig-6f/f). However, Sprr2fcre+Mig-6f/f mice were P4-responsive. P4 treatment significantly decreased STAT3 phosphorylation and epithelial proliferation in the uterus of mutant mice. We showed that Mig-6 has an important function of tumor suppressor via inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in uterine epithelial cells, and the antitumor effects of P4 are mediated by the endometrial stroma. These data help to develop a new signaling pathway in the regulation of steroid hormones in the uterus, and to overcome P4 resistance in human reproductive diseases, such as endometrial cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2755529535,"MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a potent inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor and is elevated in many human cancers that retain wild-type p53. MDM2 SNP309G is a functional polymorphism that results in elevated levels of MDM2 (due to enhanced SP1 binding to the MDM2 promoter) thus decreasing p53 activity. Mdm2SNP309G/G mice are more prone to spontaneous tumor formation than Mdm2SNP309T/T mice, providing direct evidence for the impact of this SNP in tumor development. We asked whether environmental factors impact SNP309G function and show that SNP309G cooperates with ionizing radiation to exacerbate tumor development. Surprisingly, ultraviolet B light or Benzo(a)pyrene exposure of skin shows that SNP309G allele actually protects against squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility. These contrasting differences led us to interrogate the mechanism by which Mdm2 SNP309 regulates tumor susceptibility in a tissue-specific manner. Although basal Mdm2 levels were significantly higher in most tissues in Mdm2SNP309G/G mice compared with Mdm2SNP309T/T mice, they were significantly lower in Mdm2SNP309G/G keratinocytes, the cell-type susceptible to squamous cell carcinoma. The assessment of potential transcriptional regulators in ENCODE ChIP-seq database identified transcriptional repressor E2F6 as a possible negative regulator of MDM2 expression. Our data show that E2F6 suppresses Mdm2 expression in cells harboring the SNP309G allele but not the SNP309T allele. Thus, Mdm2 SNP309G exhibits tissue-specific regulation and differentially impacts cancer risk."

We then visualize their evolutionary relationships in the form of alluvial diagrams, and show how they remain intact through APS journal splits. Quantitatively, we see that most fields undergo weak Popperian mixing, and it is rare for a field to remain isolated/undergo strong mixing. The sizes of fields obey a simple linear growth with recombination. We can also reliably predict the merging between two fields, but not for the considerably more complex splitting. Finally, we report a case study of two fields that underwent repeated merging and splitting around 1995, and how these Kuhnian events are correlated with breakthroughs on BEC, quantum teleportation, and slow light. This impact showed up quantitatively in the citations of the BEC field as a larger proportion of references from during and shortly after these events."
https://openalex.org/W2754663604,"Environmental conditions modulate cell cycle progression in many cell types. A key component of the eukaryotic cell cycle is the protein kinase Wee1, which inhibits the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 in yeast through human cells. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the protein kinase Cdr1 is a mitotic inducer that promotes mitotic entry by phosphorylating and inhibiting Wee1. Cdr1 and Wee1 both localize to punctate structures, termed nodes, on the medial cortex, but it has been unknown whether node localization can be altered by physiological signals. Here we investigated how environmental conditions regulate Cdr1 signaling for cell division. Osmotic stress induced hyperphosphorylation of the mitotic inducer Cdr1 for several hours, and cells delayed division for the same time period. This stress-induced hyperphosphorylation required both Cdr1 autophosphorylation and the stress-activated protein kinase Sty1. During osmotic stress, Cdr1 exited cortical nodes and localized in the cytoplasm. Using a series of truncation mutants, we mapped a C-terminal domain that is necessary and sufficient for Cdr1 node localization and found that Sty1 directly phosphorylates this domain in vitro. Sty1 was not required for Cdr1 exit from nodes, indicating the existence of additional regulatory signals. Both Cdr1 phosphorylation and node localization returned to basal levels when cells adapted to osmotic conditions and resumed cell cycle progression. In summary, we identified a mechanism that prevents Cdr1 colocalization with its inhibitory target Wee1 during osmotic stress. Dynamic regulation of protein localization to cortical nodes might represent a strategy to modulate entry into mitosis under differing environmental conditions."

Vitamin D deficiency may increase esophageal cancer risk. Vitamin D affects genes regulating proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation and induces the tumor suppressor 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) in other cancers. This nonrandomized interventional study assessed effects of vitamin D supplementation in Barrett’s esophagus (BE). We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation may have beneficial effects on gene expression including 15-PGDH in BE.


Methods 
BE subjects with low grade or no dysplasia received vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 50,000 international units weekly plus a proton pump inhibitor for 12 weeks. Esophageal biopsies from normal plus metaplastic BE epithelium and blood samples were obtained before and after vitamin D supplementation. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured to characterize vitamin D status. Esophageal gene expression was assessed using microarrays.


Results 
18 study subjects were evaluated. The baseline mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 27 ng/mL (normal ≥30 ng/mL). After vitamin D supplementation, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels rose significantly (median increase of 31.6 ng/mL, p<0.001). There were no significant changes in gene expression from esophageal squamous or Barrett’s epithelium including 15-PGDH after supplementation.


Conclusion 
BE subjects were vitamin D insufficient. Despite improved vitamin D status with supplementation, no significant alterations in gene expression profiles were noted. If vitamin D supplementation benefits BE, a longer duration or higher dose of supplementation may be needed."
https://openalex.org/W2754506238,"Although human occupancy is a source of airborne bacteria, the role of walkers on bacterial communities in built environments is poorly understood. Therefore, we visualized the impact of walker occupancy combined with other factors (temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dust particles) on airborne bacterial features in the Sapporo underground pedestrian space in Sapporo, Japan. Air samples (n = 18; 4,800L/each sample) were collected at 8:00 h to 20:00 h on 3 days (regular sampling) and at early morning / late night (5:50 h to 7:50 h / 22:15 h to 24:45 h) on a day (baseline sampling), and the number of CFUs (colony forming units) OTUs (operational taxonomic units) and other factors were determined. The results revealed that temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure changed with weather. The number of walkers increased greatly in the morning and evening on each regular sampling day, although total walker numbers did not differ significantly among regular sampling days. A slight increase in small dust particles (0.3–0.5μm) was observed on the days with higher temperature regardless of regular or baseline sampling. At the period on regular sampling, CFU levels varied irregularly among days, and the OTUs of 22-phylum types were observed, with the majority being from Firmicutes or Proteobacteria (γ-), including Staphylococcus sp. derived from human individuals. The data obtained from regular samplings reveled that although no direct interaction of walker occupancy and airborne CFU and OTU features was observed upon Pearson's correlation analysis, cluster analysis indicated an obvious lineage consisting of walker occupancy, CFU numbers, OTU types, small dust particles, and seasonal factors (including temperature and humidity). Meanwhile, at the period on baseline sampling both walker and CFU numbers were similarly minimal. Taken together, the results revealed a positive correlation of walker occupancy with airborne bacteria that increased with increases in temperature and humidity in the presence of airborne small particles. Moreover, the results indicated that small dust particles at high temperature and humidity may be a crucial factor responsible for stabilizing the bacteria released from walkers in built environments. The findings presented herein advance our knowledge and understanding of the relationship between humans and bacterial communities in built environments, and will help improve public health in urban communities."

In this study, an overexpression and purification procedure was developed with the aim to characterise the Pdr11p transporter. Engineering of Pdr11p variants fused at the C terminus with green fluorescent protein (Pdr11p-GFP) and containing a FLAG tag at the N terminus facilitated expression analysis and one-step purification, respectively. The detergent-solubilised and purified protein displayed a stable ATPase activity with a broad pH optimum near 7.4. Mutagenesis of the conserved lysine to methionine (K788M) in the Walker A motif abolished ATP hydrolysis. Remarkably, and in contrast to Aus1p, ATPase activity of Pdr11p was insensitive to orthovanadate and not specifically stimulated by phosphatidylserine upon reconstitution into liposomes. Our results highlight distinct differences between Pdr11p and Aus1p and create an experimental basis for further biochemical studies of both ABC transporters to elucidate their function."
https://openalex.org/W2756063040,"Hypoxia during embryonic growth in embryos is frequently a powerful determinant of development, but at least in avian embryos the effects appear to show considerable intra- and inter-specific variation. We hypothesized that some of this variation may arise from different protocols that may or may not result in exposure during the embryo's critical window for hypoxic effects. To test this hypothesis, quail embryos (Coturnix coturnix) in the intact egg were exposed to hypoxia (~15% O2) during ""early"" (Day 0 through Day 5, abbreviated as D0-D5), ""middle"" (D6-D10) or ""late"" (D11-D15) incubation or for their entire 16-18 day incubation (""continuous hypoxia"") to determine critical windows for viability and growth. Viability, body mass, beak and toe length, heart mass, and hematology (hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration) were measured on D5, D10, D15 and at hatching typically between D16 and D18 Viability rate was ~50-70% immediately following the exposure period in the early, middle and late hypoxic groups, but viability improved in the early and late groups once normoxia was restored. Middle hypoxia groups showed continuing low viability, suggesting a critical period from D6-D10 for embryo viability. The continuous hypoxia group experienced viability reaching <10% after D15. Hypoxia, especially during late and continuous hypoxia, also inhibited growth of body, beak and toe when measured at D15. Full recovery to normal body mass upon hatching occurred in all other groups except for continuous hypoxia. Contrary to previous avian studies, heart mass, hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration were not altered by any hypoxic incubation pattern. Although hypoxia can inhibit embryo viability and organ growth during most incubation periods, the greatest effects result from continuous or middle incubation hypoxic exposure. Hypoxic inhibition of growth can subsequently be ""repaired"" by catch-up growth if a final period of normoxic development is available. Collectively, these data indicate a critical developmental window for hypoxia susceptibility during the mid-embryonic period of development."

Both researchers and commercial companies expend significant time and resources to reduce the error rate. However, it has been reported that there is a sample mix-up rate of between 0.1% and 1%, not to mention the possibly higher mix-up rate during the down-stream genetic reporting processes. Even on the low end of this estimate, this translates to a significant number of mislabeled samples, especially over the projected one billion people that will be sequenced within the next decade. Here, we first describe a method to identify a small set of Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can uniquely identify a personal genome, which utilizes allele frequencies of five major continental populations reported in the 1000 genomes project and the ExAC Consortium. To make this panel more informative, we added four SNPs that are commonly used to predict ABO blood type, and another two SNPs that are capable of predicting sex. We then implement a web interface (http://qrcme.tech), nicknamed QRC (for QR code based Concordance check), which is capable of extracting the relevant ID SNPs from a raw genetic data, coding its genotype as a quick response (QR) code, and comparing QR codes to report the concordance of underlying genetic datasets. The resulting 80 fingerprinting SNPs represent a significant decrease in complexity and the number of markers used for genetic data labelling and tracking. Our method and web tool is easily accessible to both researchers and the general public who consider the accuracy of complex genetic data as a prerequisite towards precision medicine."

The aim of this paper is to describe a rhesus macaque model of brain death designed to simulate the average time and medical management described in the human literature. Methods Following approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, a brain death model was developed. Non-human primates were monitored and maintained for 20 hours after brain death induction. Vasoactive agents and fluid boluses were administered to maintain hemodynamic stability. Endocrine derangements, particularly diabetes insipidus, were aggressively managed. Results A total of 9 rhesus macaque animals were included in the study. The expected hemodynamic instability of brain death in a rostral to caudal fashion was documented in terms of blood pressure and heart rate changes. During the maintenance phase of brain death, the animal’s temperature and hemodynamics were maintained with goals of mean arterial pressure greater than 60mmHg and heart rate within 20 beats per minute of baseline. Resuscitation protocols are described so that future investigators may reproduce this model. Conclusion We have developed a reproducible large animal primate model of brain death which simulates clinical scenarios and treatment. Our model offers the opportunity for researchers to have translational model to test the efficacy of therapeutic strategies prior to human clinical trials."

Here we used molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that an A … A mismatch in a d(GAC)6·d(GAC)6 duplex induces negative supercoiling, leading to a local B-to-Z DNA transition. This transition facilitates the binding of d(GAC)7·d(GAC)7 with the Zα-binding domain of human adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1, hZαADAR1), as confirmed by CD, NMR, and microscale thermophoresis studies. The CD results indicated that hZαADAR1 recognizes the zigzag backbone of d(GAC)7·d(GAC)7 at the B-Z junction and subsequently converts it into Z-DNA via the so-called passive mechanism. Molecular dynamics simulations carried out for the modeled hZαADAR1-d(GAC)6d(GAC)6 complex confirmed the retention of previously reported important interactions between the two molecules. These findings suggest that hZαADAR1 binding with the GAC hairpin stem in COMP can lead to a non-genetic, RNA editing-mediated substitution in COMP that may then play a crucial role in the development of pseudoachondroplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2754418031,"The development of novel therapeutics to prevent cognitive decline of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is facing paramount difficulties since the translational efficacy of rodent models did not resulted in better clinical results. Currently approved treatments, including the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (DON) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine (MEM) provide marginal therapeutic benefits to AD patients. There is an urgent need to develop a predictive animal model that is phylogenetically proximal to humans to achieve better translation. The non-human primate grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is increasingly used in aging research, but there is no published results related to the impact of known pharmacological treatments on age-related cognitive impairment observed in this primate. In the present study we investigated the effects of DON and MEM on sleep-deprivation (SD)—induced memory impairment in young and aged male mouse lemurs. In particular, spatial memory impairment was evaluated using a circular platform task after 8 h of total SD. Acute single doses of DON or MEM (0.1 and 1mg/kg) or vehicle were administered intraperitoneally 3 h before the cognitive task during the SD procedure. Results indicated that both doses of DON were able to prevent the SD-induced deficits in retrieval of spatial memory as compared to vehicle-treated animals, both in young and aged animals Likewise, MEM show a similar profile at 1 mg/kg but not at 0.1mg/kg. Taken together, these results indicate that two widely used drugs for mitigating cognitive deficits in AD were partially effective in sleep deprived mouse lemurs, which further support the translational potential of this animal model. Our findings demonstrate the utility of this primate model for further testing cognitive enhancing drugs in development for AD or other neuropsychiatric conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2755688921,"Oncolytic viruses (OV) have recently emerged as a promising therapeutic modality in cancer treatment. OV selectively infect and kill tumor cells, while sparing untransformed cells. The direct cytotoxic effects combined with the capacity to trigger an immune response make OV an appealing combination partner in the burgeoning field of cancer immunotherapy. One of the leading OV therapeutic candidates is the double-stranded RNA virus reovirus. In order to improve the oncolytic activity of reovirus and allow for systemic administration despite the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies, cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells were explored as cell carriers for reovirus delivery. In this study, CIK cells were successfully loaded with reovirus ex vivo, and viral replication was limited in CIK cells. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry demonstrated that CIK cells retained reovirus on the surface. Moreover, CIK cells could promote reovirus infection of tumor cells in the presence of neutralizing antibodies; meanwhile, cytotoxicity of CIK cells was increased after loading with reovirus. These findings support further investigation of reovirus and CIK combination for antitumor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2754396944,"The aim of this study was to develop a suitable vaccine antigen against porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), the causative agent of post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome, which causes significant economic losses in swine breeding. Chimeric antigens containing PCV2b Cap protein sequences based on the mouse polyomavirus (MPyV) nanostructures were developed. First, universal vectors for baculovirus-directed production of chimeric MPyV VLPs or pentamers of the major capsid protein, VP1, were designed for their exploitation as vaccines against other pathogens. Various strategies were employed based on: A) exposure of selected immunogenic epitopes on the surface of MPyV VLPs by insertion into a surface loop of the VP1 protein, B) insertion of foreign protein molecules inside the VLPs, or C) fusion of a foreign protein or its part with the C-terminus of VP1 protein, to form giant pentamers of a chimeric protein. We evaluated these strategies by developing a recombinant vaccine against porcine circovirus 2. All candidate vaccines induced the production of antibodies against the capsid protein of porcine circovirus after immunization of mice. The candidate vaccine, Var C, based on fusion of mouse polyomavirus and porcine circovirus capsid proteins, could induce the production of antibodies with the highest PCV2 neutralizing capacity. Its ability to induce the production of neutralization antibodies was verified after immunization of pigs. The advantage of this vaccine, apart from its efficient production in insect cells and easy purification, is that it represents a DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) vaccine, which also induces an immune response against the mouse polyoma VP1 protein and is thus able to distinguish between vaccinated and naturally infected animals."
https://openalex.org/W2755319827,"The aim of the study was to evaluate psychological effects of the state-of-art intensified follow-up protocol for colorectal cancer patients in the CEAwatch trial.At two time points during the CEAwatch trial questionnaires regarding patients' attitude towards follow-up, patients' psychological functioning and patients' experiences and expectations were sent to participants by post. Linear mixed models were fitted to assess the influences and secular trends of the intensified follow-up on patients' attitude towards follow-up and psychological functioning. As secondary outcome, odds ratios were calculated using ordinal logistic mixed model to compare patients' experiences to their expectations, as well as their experiences at two different time points.No statistical significant effects of the intensified follow-up were found on patients' attitude towards the follow-up and psychological functioning variables. Patients had high expectations of the intensified follow-up and their experiences at the second time point were more positive compared to the scores at the first time point.The intensified follow-up protocol posed no adverse effects on patients' attitude towards follow-up and psychological functioning. In general, patients were more nervous and anxious at the start of the new follow-up protocol, had high expectations of the new follow-up protocol and were troubled by the nuisances of the blood sample testing. As they spent more time in the follow-up and became more adapted to it, the nervousness and anxiety decreased and the preference for the frequent blood test became high in replacement of conversations with the doctors."
https://openalex.org/W2593550342,"We show how faceted search using a combination of traditional classification systems and mixed-membership topic models can go beyond keyword search to inform resource discovery, hypothesis formulation, and argument extraction for interdisciplinary research. Our test domain is the history and philosophy of scientific work on animal mind and cognition. The methods can be generalized to other research areas and ultimately support a system for semi-automatic identification of argument structures. We provide a case study for the application of the methods to the problem of identifying and extracting arguments about anthropomorphism during a critical period in the development of comparative psychology. We show how a combination of classification systems and mixed-membership models trained over large digital libraries can inform resource discovery in this domain. Through a novel approach of ""drill-down"" topic modeling---simultaneously reducing both the size of the corpus and the unit of analysis---we are able to reduce a large collection of fulltext volumes to a much smaller set of pages within six focal volumes containing arguments of interest to historians and philosophers of comparative psychology. The volumes identified in this way did not appear among the first ten results of the keyword search in the HathiTrust digital library and the pages bear the kind of ""close reading"" needed to generate original interpretations that is the heart of scholarly work in the humanities. Zooming back out, we provide a way to place the books onto a map of science originally constructed from very different data and for different purposes. The multilevel approach advances understanding of the intellectual and societal contexts in which writings are interpreted."
https://openalex.org/W2756260097,"Rab proteins are a family of small GTPases involved in a variety of cellular processes. The Rab11 subfamily in particular directs key steps of intracellular functions involving vesicle trafficking of the endosomal recycling pathway. This Rab subfamily works through a series of effector proteins including the Rab11-FIPs (Rab11 Family-Interacting Proteins). While the Rab11 subfamily has been well characterized at the cellular level, its function within human organ systems is still being explored. In an effort to further study these proteins, we conducted a preliminary investigation of a subgroup of endosomal Rab proteins in a range of human cell lines by Western blotting. The results from this analysis indicated that Rab11a, Rab11c(Rab25) and Rab14 were expressed in a wide range of cell lines, including the human placental trophoblastic BeWo cell line. These findings encouraged us to further analyse the localization of these Rabs and their common effector protein, the Rab Coupling Protein (RCP), by immunofluorescence microscopy and to extend this work to normal human placental tissue. The placenta is a highly active exchange interface, facilitating transfer between mother and fetus during pregnancy. As Rab11 proteins are closely involved in transcytosis we hypothesized that the placenta would be an interesting human tissue model system for Rab investigation. By immunofluorescence microscopy, Rab11a, Rab11c(Rab25), Rab14 as well as their common FIP effector RCP showed prominent expression in the placental cell lines. We also identified the expression of these proteins in human placental lysates by Western blot analysis. Further, via fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we noted abundant localization of these proteins within key functional areas of primary human placental tissues, namely the outer syncytial layer of placental villous tissue and the endothelia of fetal blood vessels. Overall these findings highlight the expression of the Rab11 family within the human placenta, with novel localization at the maternal-fetal interface."

https://openalex.org/W2756420142,"Central arterial stiffness has been shown to play a key role in cardiovascular disease. However, evidence regarding such arterial stiffness from various arterial segments in relation to B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) remains elusive.A total of 1255 participants (47.8% men; mean age: 62.6 ± 12.3 [SD] years) with preserved left ventricular function (ejection fraction ≥50%) and ≥1 risk factors were consecutively studied. Arterial pulse wave velocity (PWV) by automatic device (VP-2000; Omron Healthcare) for heart-femoral (hf-PWV), brachial-ankle (ba-PWV), and heart-carotid (hc-PWV) segments were obtained and related to BNP concentrations (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA).Subjects in the highest hf-PWV quartile were older and had worse renal function and higher blood pressure (all P < 0.05). Elevated PWV (m/s) was correlated with elevated BNP (pg/ml) (beta coefficient = 19.3, 12.4, 5.9 for hf-PWV, ba-PWV, hc-PWV respectively, all p < 0.05). After accounting for clinical co-variates and left ventricle mass index (LVMI), both hf-PWV and ba-PWV were correlated with higher BNP (beta coefficient = 8.3, 6.4 respectively, P < 0.01 for each). Adding both hf-PWV and ba-PWV to LVMI significantly expanded ROC in predicting abnormal BNP>100 pg/ml (both P < 0.01), but only hf-PWV presented significant integrated discrimination improvement to predict risk for BNP concentrations (0.7%, P = 0.029).A significant segmental PWV associated with biomarker BNP concentrations suggests that arterial stiffness is associated with myocardial damage."
