https://openalex.org/W2134353614,"We describe the isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding the alpha subunit of a new voltage-sensitive sodium channel, microI, from rat skeletal muscle. The 1840 amino acid microI peptide is homologous to alpha subunits from rat brain, but, like the protein from eel electroplax, lacks an extended (approximately 200) amino acid segment between homologous domains I and II. Northern blot analysis indicates that the 8.5 kb microI transcript is preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle. Sodium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes from synthetic RNA encoding microI are blocked by tetrodotoxin and mu-conotoxin at concentrations near 5 nM. The expressed sodium channels have gating kinetics similar to the native channels in rat muscle fibers, except that inactivation occurs more slowly."
https://openalex.org/W2025810192,"Two cDNAs encoding novel GABAA receptor subunits were isolated from a rat brain library. These subunits, gamma 2 and delta, share approximately 35% sequence identity with alpha and beta subunits and form functional GABA-gated chloride channels when expressed alone in vitro. The gamma 2 subunit is the rat homolog of the human gamma 2 subunit recently shown to be important for benzodiazepine pharmacology. Cellular localization of the mRNAs encoding the gamma 2 and delta subunits in rat brain revealed that largely distinct neuronal subpopulations express the two subunits. The delta subunit distribution resembles that of the high affinity GABAA receptor labeled with [3H]muscimol; the gamma 2 subunit distribution resembles that of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam. These findings have implications for the composition of two different GABAA receptor subtypes and for information processing in networks using GABA for signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2044779910,"The systemic administration of either methamphetamine or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to experimental animals produces degenerative changes in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons or their axon terminals. This study was conducted to determine if excitatory amino acids, which appear to be involved in various neurodegenerative disorders, might also contribute to the dopaminergic neurotoxicity produced in mice by either methamphetamine or MPTP. MK-801, phencyclidine, and ketamine, noncompetitive antagonists of one subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor, the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, provided substantial protection against neurotoxicity produced by methamphetamine but not that produced by MPTP. These findings indicate that excitatory amino acids play an important role in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic damage induced by methamphetamine."
https://openalex.org/W2048773003,"Immunocytochemical localization of Na+ channel subtypes RI and RII showed that RI immunoreactivity is relatively low and homogeneous along the rostral-caudal extent of sagittal brain sections, whereas RII staining is heterogeneous and relatively dense in the forebrain, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The somata of the dentate granule cells, hippocampal pyramidal cells, cerebellar Purkinje cells, and spinal motor neurons are immunoreactive for RI but not RII. In contrast, areas rich in unmyelinated nerve fibers, such as the mossy fibers of the dentate granule cells, the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens of the hippocampus, and the molecular layer of the cerebellum, are strongly immunoreactive for RII but not RI. Differential regulation of expression of RI and RII genes may allow differential modulation of Na+ channel density in somata and axons. The sites of RI localization correlate closely with sites where sustained Na+ currents have been recorded."
https://openalex.org/W2075409024,"We have investigated the influence of the neural cell adhesion molecules L1 and N-CAM on second messenger systems using a PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cell line as a model and triggering cell surface receptors by specific antibody binding. Antibodies directed against L1 and N-CAM, but not against other cell surface components, reduce intracellular levels of the inositol phosphates IP2 and IP3, while intracellular levels of cAMP are unaffected. Antibodies against L1 and N-CAM also reduce intracellular pH and increase intracellular Ca2+ by opening Ca2+ channels in a pertussis toxin-inhibitable manner, suggesting the involvement of a G protein in the signal transduction process. Cross-linking of the adhesion molecules on the surface membrane is not required for the effects to occur. Furthermore, adhesion of single PC12 cells to each other elicits effects on intracellular pH and Ca2+ similar to those seen after application, underscoring the physiological significance of the observed changes."
https://openalex.org/W2074369656,"In situ hybridization histochemistry and RNA blot analysis were used to study expression of nerve growth factor receptor (NGF-R) mRNA in rat spinal cord motoneurons. The results show that NGF-R mRNA is expressed at high levels in rat spinal cord motoneurons at the time of naturally occurring cell death. This expression is sustained, but reduced, during synapse formation and is subsequently greatly reduced in the adult spinal cord. A unilateral crush lesion of the sciatic nerve resulted in an 8-fold increase in NGF-R mRNA in adult rat spinal cord motoneurons 3 days after lesion, compared with the nonlesioned side. NGF-R mRNA induction was even more pronounced 7 and 14 days after lesion, reaching levels 12 times higher than those on the nonlesioned side. However, 6 weeks after lesion, when the motor function of the leg was largely restored, NGF-R expression had decreased to levels similar to those on the contralateral side. We therefore suggest that NGF-R mediates a trophic or axonal guidance function for developing and regenerating spinal cord motoneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2051738169,"We have isolated cDNA clones encoding SCIP, a POU domain gene expressed by myelin-forming glia of the central and peripheral nervous systems. In purified Schwann cells cultured in the absence of neurons, expression of SCIP is suppressed. This suppression is relieved by cAMP, and induction of SCIP mRNA by this second messenger precedes CAMP induction of myelin-specific genes. Similarly, SCIP expression in vivo precedes full expression of myelin-specific genes in developing oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. The sequence of the SCIP POU domain is identical to that of Tst-1, a recently identified member of a family of POU domain genes expressed by restricted subsets of neurons. Our results demonstrate that SCIP is also expressed by myelin-forming glia and suggest that it plays a central role in the progressive determination of these cells and their commitment to myelination."
https://openalex.org/W2009085222,"Blood pressure is influenced by multiple genetic loci whose identities are largely unknown. A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in the renin gene was found between Dahl salt-hypertension-sensitive (S) and Dahl salt-hypertension-resistant (R) rats. In an F2 population derived from crossing S and R rats, the renin RFLP cosegregated with blood pressure. One dose of the S-rat renin allele was associated with an increment in blood pressure of approximately 10 mmHg, and two doses of this allele increased blood pressure approximately 20 mmHg. From this it can be definitively concluded that in the rat the renin gene is, or is closely linked to, one of the genes regulating blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2006287346,"We have used immunogold electron microscopy to study the organization of the acetylcholine receptor, 43 kd protein, voltage-sensitive Na+ channel, and ankyrin in the postsynaptic membrane of the rat neuromuscular junction. The acetylcholine receptor and the 43 kd protein are concentrated at the crests of the postsynaptic folds, coextensive with the subsynaptic density. In contrast, Na+ channels and ankyrin are concentrated in the membranes of the troughs and in perijunctional membranes, both characterized by discontinuous submembrane electron-dense plaques. This configuration of interspersed postsynaptic membrane domains enriched in either Na+ channels or acetylcholine receptors may facilitate the initiation of the muscle action potential. Furthermore, the results support the involvement of ankyrin in immobilizing Na+ channels in specific membrane domains, analogous to the proposed involvement of the 43 kd protein in acetylcholine receptor immobilization."
https://openalex.org/W2017180464,"Elasmobranch fishes, the coelacanth, estivating lungfish, amphibians, and mammals synthesize urea by the ornithine-urea cycle; by comparison, urea synthetic activity is generally insignificant in teleostean fishes. It is reported here that isolated liver cells of two teleost toadfishes, Opsanus beta and Opsansus tau, synthesize urea by the ornithine-urea cycle at substantial rates. Because toadfish excrete ammonia, do not use urea as an osmolyte, and have substantial levels of urease in their digestive systems, urea may serve as a transient nitrogen store, forming the basis of a nitrogen conservation shuttle system between liver and gut as in ruminants and hibernators. Toadfish synthesize urea using enzymes and subcellular distributions similar to those of elasmobranchs: glutamine-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthethase (CPS III) and mitochondrial arginase. In contrast, mammals have CPS I (ammonia-dependent) and cytosolic arginase. Data on CPS and arginases in other fishes, including lungfishes and the coelacanth, support the hypothesis that the ornithine-urea cycle, a monophyletic trait in the vertebrates, underwent two key changes before the evolution of the extant lungfishes: a switch from CPS III to CPS I and replacement of mitochondrial arginase by a cytosolic equivalent."
https://openalex.org/W1487550059,"Abstract P-Glycoprotein (P-GP) plays a pivotal role in maintaining the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype. This membrane glycoprotein is overproduced in MDR cells and the endometrium of the mouse gravid uterus (Arceci, R.J., Croop, J.M., Horwitz, S.B., and Housman, D. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 4350-4354). This latter observation and an interest in endogenous substrates for P-GP led to a study of the interaction of steroids with P-GP found in the endometrium of the mouse gravid uterus and in MDR cells derived from the murine macrophage-like cell J774.2. [3H]Azidopine labeling of P-GP from these two sources was inhibited by various steroids, particularly progesterone. Progesterone also markedly inhibited [3H]vinblastine binding to membrane vesicles prepared from MDR cells, enhanced vinblastine accumulation in MDR cells, and increased the sensitivity of MDR cells to vinblastine. In addition, we have demonstrated that the hydrophobicity of a steroid is important in determining its effect on inhibition of drug binding to P-GP. It is concluded that progesterone, a relatively nontoxic endogenous steroid, interacts with P-GP and is capable of reversing drug resistance in MDR cells."
https://openalex.org/W2001545716,"Membrane currents in cultured murine oligodendrocytes and their precursors were characterized using the patch-clamp technique. Prior to recording, cells were identified by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies characteristic of two types of precursor cells and two differentiation stages of oligodendrocytes. The most immature, A2B5 antigen-positive glial precursors, expressed four types of voltage-activated K+ currents and tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ currents. The more differentiated cells, O4 antigen-positive glial precursors, expressed similar K+ currents, but Na+ currents were recorded in only a minority of cells. In differentiated O1 and O10 antigen-positive oligodendrocytes the channels characteristic of precursor cells were no longer observed, but an inwardly rectifying K+ current was apparent. Thus, channel expression by cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage correlates with differentiation stage and is more complex in precursor cells than in oligodendrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1976806757,"Cholesterol balance in mammalian cells is maintained in part by sterol-mediated repression of gene transcription for the low density lipoprotein receptor and enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. A promoter sequence termed the sterol regulatory element (SRE) is essential for this repression. With the use of an oligonucleotide containing the SRE to screen a human hepatoma complementary DNA expression library, a clone for a DNA binding protein was isolated that binds to the conserved SRE octanucleotide in both a sequence-specific and a single-strand--specific manner. This protein contains seven highly conserved zinc finger repeats that exhibit striking sequence similarity to retroviral nucleic acid binding proteins (NBPs). We have designated the protein ""cellular NBP"" (CNBP). CNBP is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, is up regulated by sterols, and exhibits binding specificity that correlates with in vivo function. These properties are consistent with a role in sterol-mediated control of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2039943037,"Chronic infusion of nerve growth factor (NGF) into the forebrain of the adult rat produced increases in NGF receptor (NGF-R) mRNA hybridization, NGF-R immunoreactivity, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA hybridization, and neuronal hypertrophy, when compared with vehicle infusion or noninfused rat brain. In situ hybridization showed NGF induction of NGF-R gene expression, documented by increases in the number of NGF-R mRNA-positive cells within the medial septum, diagonal band, and nucleus basalis magnocellularis. NGF also produced hypertrophy of ChAT mRNA-positive neurons. These results suggest that NGF produces cholinergic neuronal hypertrophy through induction of NGF-R gene expression within the basal forebrain."
https://openalex.org/W1598767975,"Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were used to investigate the regulation of glucokinase gene expression by insulin and glucagon. Insulin added in physiological concentrations to the culture medium causes de novo induction of glucokinase mRNA. The induced plateau is reached 4 to 8 h after insulin addition, and the mRNA level remains high as long as insulin is present. Comparison of the potencies of insulin, proinsulin, and insulin-like growth factor I in this system indicates that induction by insulin is mediated via the insulin receptor. The magnitude of the insulin effect is independent of the extracellular glucose concentration. Run-on transcription assays with isolated nuclei show that the mRNA build up depends primarily on a specific stimulation of glucokinase gene transcription. Glucagon added to hepatocytes together with a supramaximal concentration of insulin prevents induction of glucokinase mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of glucagon is mimicked by 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP. The effect of this agent has also been tested in hepatocytes first induced for maximal glucokinase gene transcription by culture with insulin alone for 12 h. The transcriptional activity of the gene as measured by run-on assay was completely turned off within 30 min after addition of the cyclic nucleotide. Under these conditions, glucokinase mRNA decays rapidly, with an apparent half-life of 45 min. The mRNA degradation rate was similarly rapid after insulin withdrawal from induced cells. Thus, a cAMP-mediated repression mechanism is a key aspect in the regulation of glucokinase gene transcription in the hepatocyte. Insulin may act by relieving the gene from repression."
https://openalex.org/W1987216903,"To investigate the regulation of messenger RNA abundance by circadian clocks, genomic and complementary DNA libraries were screened with complementary DNA probes enriched, by means of sequential rounds of subtractive hybridization, for sequences complementary to transcripts specific to either early morning or early evening cultures of Neurospora. Only two morning-specific genes were identified through this protocol. RNA blot analysis verified that the abundance of the transcripts arising from these genes oscillates with a period of 21.5 hours in a clock wild-type strain and 29 hours in the long-period clock mutant strain frq7. Genetic mapping through the use of restriction fragment length polymorphisms shows the two genes, ccg-1 and ccg-2, to be unlinked. These data provide a view of the extent of clock control of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1997158966,"The peptides neuropeptide Y (NPY) and bradykinin (BK) both inhibited Ca2+ currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRG) in vitro. The effects of both peptides were completely blocked by treatment of cells with pertussis toxin. Based on antigenic determinants, DRG cells contained at least two pertussis toxin substrates, alpha o (Mr, 39 kd) and alpha i2 (Mr, 40 kd). We examined the ability of three purified bovine alpha subunits (identified with antibodies as alpha o, alpha i1, and alpha i2) to reconstitute the inhibitory effects of NPY and BK. Reconstitution of NPY effects occurred according to the potency series alpha o greater than alpha i1 much greater than alpha i2. However, in the case of BK all three G proteins were approximately equally effective. Whereas complete reconstitution of NPY effects could be obtained with alpha o, no single alpha subunit produced complete reconstitution of BK. Combinations of alpha o and alpha i2, however, were able to completely reconstitute the effects of BK. Thus several G proteins can effect the regulation of Ca2+ channels in these cells. However, neurotransmitters may be selective in the G proteins or combinations of G proteins utilized to achieve this regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2125763225,"Two monoclonal antibodies, SE6 and 1B6, were raised against microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B), a major component of the neuronal cytoskeleton. 5E6 recognized the entire MAPIB population, while 1B6 detected only phosphorylated forms. Affinity-purified MAP1B appeared as a long, filamentous molecule (186 ± 38 nm) with a small spherical portion at one end, forming long cross-bridges between microtubules in vitro. These results, together with in vivo data from immunogold methods, demonstrate that MAP1B is a component of cross-bridges between microtubules in neurons. By immunohistochemical analysis, phosphorylated forms were shown to exist mainly in axons, whereas unphosphorylated forms were limited to cell bodies and dendrites. Phosphorylated MAP1B was quite abundant in developing axons, suggesting its essential role in axonal elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1560455251,"We have introduced two types of mutations into cDNAs that encode the α subunit of Gs, the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase. The arginine residue (Arg187) that is the presumed site of ADP-ribosylation of Gsα by cholera toxin has been changed to Ala, Glu, or Lys. The rate constant for hydrolysis of GTP by all of these mutants is reduced approximately 100-fold compared with the wild-type protein. As predicted from this change, these proteins activate adenylyl cyclase constitutively in the presence of GTP. Despite these substitutions, cholera toxin still catalyzes the incorporation of 0.2-0.3 mol of ADP-ribose/mol of mutant α subunit. The sequence near the carboxyl terminus of Gsα was altered to resemble those in Giα polypeptides, which are substrates for pertussis toxin. Despite this change, the mutant protein is a poor substrate for pertussis toxin. Although this protein has unaltered rates of GDP dissociation and GTP hydrolysis, its ability to activate adenylyl cyclase in the presence of GTP is enhanced by 3-fold when compared with the wild-type protein but only when these assays are performed after reconstitution of Gsα into cyc− (Gsα-deficient) S49 cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2093325915,"Three major subtypes of glutamate receptors that are coupled to cation channels are known. Recently an additional subtype that is coupled to G proteins and stimulates inositol phospholipid metabolism (the metabotropic glutamate receptor) has been proposed. The pharmacological characteristics of this receptor have now been examined. Although it shares some agonists with N-methyl-D-aspartate- and quisqualate-subtype receptors, it shares virtually no antagonists with any of the three cation channel-coupled receptor subtypes. Thus the metabotropic glutamate receptor belongs to a receptor category that is completely different from that of the other three receptor subtypes, not only functionally, but also pharmacologically."
https://openalex.org/W1977220059,"The temperature dependences of the reduction potentials (E degrees') of wild-type human myoglobin (Mb) and three site-directed mutants have been measured by the use of thin-layer spectroelectrochemistry. Residue Val68, which is in van der Waals contact with the heme in Mb, has been replaced by Glu, Asp, and Asn. The changes in E degrees' and the standard entropy (delta S degrees') and enthalpy (delta H degrees') of reduction in the mutant proteins were determined relative to values for wild type; the change in E degrees' at 25 degrees C was about -200 millivolts for the Glu and Asp mutants, and about -80 millivolts for the Asn mutant. At pH 7.0, reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) in the Glu and Asp mutants is accompanied by uptake of a proton by the protein. These studies demonstrate that Mb can tolerate substitution of a buried hydrophobic group by potentially charged and polar residues and that such amino acid replacements can lead to substantial changes in the redox thermodynamics of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2046764546,"The voltage-dependent calcium current in chemically differentiated NG108-15 cells is depressed by noradrenaline acting on alpha-adrenoreceptors. The response is absent in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin, implicating the involvement of a G-protein. To identify this G-protein, we have studied the response to noradrenaline in cells preinjected with antibodies specific for two G-proteins, Gi and Go. Cells injected with the Gi antibody responded normally to noradrenaline. In contrast, the response to noradrenaline in cells injected with the Go antibody was markedly attenuated. We conclude that Go is employed in coupling alpha-adrenoreceptors to the calcium channels in NG108-15 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1663514770,"Abstract Somatostatin (SOM) is a neuroendocrine tetradecapeptide that suppresses specific functions of differentiated T-cells and antibody-producing cells. The Jurkat line of human leukemic T-cells and U266 IgE-producing human myeloma cells bound [I-Tyr11]SOM specifically. The maximal level of specific binding was attained by 1-2 h at 22 degrees C for both types of cells and reversed by 70-85% within 2-3 h after the addition of excess nonradioactive SOM. Computer-assisted Scatchard analysis of the competition curves revealed two classes of binding sites for both cells. An average of 144 and 1295 high affinity receptors per Jurkat and U266 cells had a Kd value of 3 pM and 5 pM, respectively, whereas a large number of low affinity sites had Kd values of 66 nM and 100 nM. The affinity of the analogs somatostatin 28, [I-Tyr11]SOM, and [D-Trp8, D-Cys14]SOM for Jurkat and U266 cell lines, relative to SOM, suggested a degree of specificity similar to receptors on neuroendocrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980023337,"Expression of the inhibitory glycine receptor complex was investigated in primary cultures of fetal mouse spinal cord using sensitive immunomethods. In these cells, glycine receptor is predominantly of the neonatal isoform characterized by a low affinity for the antagonist strychnine. It contains a ligand binding subunit that differs from that of the adult receptor in antigenic epitopes and apparent molecular weight. Whereas in vivo the neonatal receptor isoform is completely replaced by the adult isoform within 3 weeks after birth, this exchange of subtypes is not seen in culture. The increased expression of the cytoplasmic glycine receptor-associated polypeptide of 93 kd occurring after birth is also seen under culture conditions. Purification of glycine receptor from cultures yielded polypeptides of 49 kd and 93 kd, suggesting that the membrane-spanning core of the neonatal receptor may be a homooligomer composed of 49 kd subunits. About half of the 49 kd subunit is cleaved by trypsinization of the cultures, indicating a predominant cell surface localization of the receptor. Pulse-labeling experiments revealed the 49 kd subunit to be a metabolically stable glycoprotein (half-life approximately 2 days). After its synthesis, a transition time of 30-45 min is required for acquisition of a strychnine binding conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1983504750,"Neurons dissociated from the hippocampal formations of neonatal rats were grown in medium containing kynurenic acid (a glutamate receptor antagonist) and elevated Mg2+. Such chronically blocked neurons, when first exposed to medium without blockers (after 0.5-5.0 months), generated intense seizure-like activity. This consisted of bursts of synchronous electrical responses that resembled paroxysmal depolarization shifts and sustained depolarizations that, in some neurons, nearly abolished the resting potential. Sustained depolarizations were usually reversed by timely application of kynurenate or 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, indicating that continuous activation of glutamate receptors was required for their maintenance. Prolonged periods of intense seizure-like activity usually killed most neurons in the culture. This system allows seizure-related cellular mechanisms to be studied in long-term cell culture."
https://openalex.org/W2082124668,"We are investigating the intracellular events involved in the induction of neurite outgrowth. The phorbol ester TPA, an activator of protein kinase C, potentiates neurite outgrowth from ciliary ganglion neurons cultured on suboptimal laminin concentrations, but not on optimal laminin concentrations. TPA also stimulates growth on fibronectin and collagen similar to that observed on laminin under control conditions. Manipulations that elevate intracellular cAMP levels (expected to activate A kinase) reduce neurite outgrowth on laminin. The protein kinase C inhibitors H7 and sphingosine inhibit neurite outgrowth on laminin in a reversible and dose-dependent manner. H7 does not inhibit the process outgrowth induced by concanavalin A in the same neurons. The results suggest that activation of protein kinase C is an important step in the neurite outgrowth caused by laminin binding to its receptor(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1970650510,"Isolation and mapping of a mouse complementary DNA sequence (mouse Y-finger) encoding a multiple, potential zinc-binding, finger protein homologous to the candidate human testis-determining factor gene is reported. Four similar sequences were identified in Hind III-digested mouse genomic DNA. Two (7.2 and 2.0 kb) were mapped to the Y chromosome. Only the 2.0-kb fragment, however, was correlated with testis determination. Polymerase chain reaction analysis suggests both Y loci are transcribed in adult testes. A 3.6-kb fragment was mapped to the X chromosome between the T16H and T6R1 translocation breakpoints, and a fourth (6.0 kb) was mapped to chromosome 10. Hence, mYfin sequences have been duplicated several times in the mouse, although they are not duplicated in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2036472297,"Three products of the MAP2 gene are known: MAP2A and MAP2B (Mr ∼200,000) and MAP2C (Mr 70,000). The structural relationship between these MAPs and the basis for their diversity in size are unknown. Previously, we found that a significant fraction of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase was associated via its regulatory subunits with MAP2A and MAP2B. We now use an antibody prepared against the microtubule binding domain of MAP2A and MAP2B to identify MAP2C. All three forms of MAP2 bound to cAMP affinity columns and reacted with 32P-labeled RII in a blot overlay assay. By assaying proteolytic fragments of MAP2A and MAP2B as well as segments of MAP2 expressed in E. coli, the binding site for R11 was localized to an 83 amino acid stretch at the distal (amino-terminal) end of the MAP2 arm domain. Therefore, the microtubule binding and RII binding domains are located at extreme opposite ends of MAP2A and MAP2B, and both are conserved in the much shorter MAP2C."
https://openalex.org/W1983361084,"The number of sodium channels increases sharply during development of rat skeletal muscle cells in vitro. An 8.5 kb mRNA encoding sodium channel alpha subunit rises to a peak on day 13 in vitro and falls to a value of 50% of the peak by day 18, consistent with the conclusion that mRNA abundance is a major determinant of the rapid rise in sodium channel number. Electrical activity and increased cytosolic calcium decrease the level of alpha subunit mRNA, and cAMP increases its level in parallel with changes in the number of sodium channels. The similarity between the changes in mRNA levels and sodium channel density indicates that the regulation of alpha subunit mRNA level is an important mechanism of feedback regulation of sodium channel density by electrical activity in developing rat muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036440284,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is a substrate for at least three different protein kinases, and phosphorylation of the receptor has been shown to increase its rate of desensitization. However, the first messengers that regulate AChR phosphorylation have not yet been identified. This study demonstrates that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide present in the axon terminals of the neuromuscular junction, regulates phosphorylation of the AChR in primary rat myotube cultures. CGRP, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20-1724, increased phosphorylation of the α and δ subunits of the AChR. CGRP-induced phosphorylation of the AChR had the same subunit specificity and temporal sequence as previously observed using forskolin or CAMP analogs. Phosphorylation of the AChR in the presence of CGRP appears to be mediated by CGRP-stimulated increases in cAMP levels leading to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The present results, taken together with the recent demonstration that CGRP increases the rate of AChR desensitization in mouse myotubes, suggest that CGRP may play a physiological role as a regulator of AChR desensitization by modulating AChR phosphorylation at the neuromuscular junction."
https://openalex.org/W2080228571,"In prior studies, nerve growth factor (NGF) administration induced a robust, selective increase in the neurochemical differentiation of caudate-putamen cholinergic neurons. In this study, expression of NGF and its receptor was examined to determine whether endogenous NGF might serve as a neurotrophic factor for these neurons. The temporal pattern of NGF gene expression and the levels of NGF mRNA and protein were distinct from those found in other brain regions. NGF and high-affinity NGF binding were present during cholinergic neurochemical differentiation and persisted into adult-hood. An increase in NGF binding during the third postnatal week was correlated with increasing choline acetyltransferase activity. The data are consistent with a role for endogenous NGF in the development and, possibly, the maintenance of caudate-putamen cholinergic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2125188380,"Hybridization of GABAA receptor probes to human chromosomes in situ and to DNA from sorted human chromosomes has localized the genes encoding a beta subunit and three isoforms of the alpha subunit. The alpha 2 and beta genes are both located on chromosome 4 in bands p12-p13 and may be adjacent. The alpha 1 gene is on chromosome 5 (bands q34-q35) and the alpha 3 gene is on the X chromosome. The alpha 3 locus was mapped also on the mouse X chromosome using genetic break-point analysis in an interspecies pedigree. The combined results locate the human alpha 3 gene within band Xq28, in a location that makes it a candidate gene for the X-linked form of manic depression."
https://openalex.org/W1505871205,"Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in which cellular immune functions are severely impaired. Acute infection and subsequent destruction of helper T cells, although occurring readily in cell cultures, do not appear to be the only mechanisms mediating helper T cell loss. Other mechanisms that may account for the loss of helper T cells include: T cell syncytia formation, decreased T cell production, and autoimmune-related destruction of helper T cells. Immune abnormalities seen early in the course of HIV infection include immune hyperactivation and autoimmune phenomena suggestive of immune dysregulation rather than immune deficiency. Many changes in immune function are, in fact, seen in HIV-seropositive patients who possess a normal number of helper T cells. Mechanisms (other than the loss of helper T cells) that may contribute to the immune abnormalities seen in these patients include noninfectious effects of HIV and HIV proteins, effects of HIV on non-T cells, autoimmune-related manifestations of HIV infection, and HIV-induced activation of normal immunosuppressive circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2085512588,"The ZFY gene in the sex-determining region of the human Y chromosome encodes a ""zinc-finger"" protein that may be the testis-determining factor, TDF. Although the Y chromosomes of most placental mammals carry a single homolog of ZFY, the mouse Y chromosome has two homologs, both in the sex-determining (Sxr) region. Zfy-1 alone may suffice to determine maleness; Zfy-2 is dispensable, as it was deleted in an Sxr variant that retains sex-determining function but has lost other genes. Both loci mapped near the centromere of the mouse Y chromosome. The Y chromosomes of the subspecies Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus were distinguishable by a Zfy-1 restriction fragment polymorphism, which can be used to study their differing interactions with autosomal sex-determining genes."
https://openalex.org/W1597917646,"Abstract Conditions that regulate the generation of the Ca2(+)-independent form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells have been investigated. Under basal conditions, 4-5% of total CaM-kinase II activity, assayed in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, was the Ca2(+)-independent form active in the presence of EGTA. Depolarization with 56 mM K+ produced a transient increase to 9% Ca2+ independence within 15 s followed by a decline to 5-6% at 10 min. The divalent cation ionophore ionomycin elicited 10% Ca2+ independence, which remained elevated. Removal of Ca2+ from the Krebs-Ringer medium reduced basal Ca2+ independence to 1-2% and eliminated the elevation in response to K+ depolarization. Inclusion of 5 microM okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, in the incubation medium potentiated the levels of Ca2(+)-independent activity of CaM-kinase II. Additional studies in granule cell extracts indicated that there were both okadiac acid-sensitive and -insensitive protein phosphatases involved in the reversal of the Ca2+ independence of CaM-kinase II. Phosphopeptide mapping of the CNBr-cleaved 32P-labeled 58-60-kDa subunit of CaM-kinase II revealed that under basal conditions, the kinase contained phosphate in many sites. Conditions that promoted formation of the Ca2(+)-independent form of the kinase increased the 32P incorporation into multiple sites of the kinase. However, there was a good temporal correlation between 32P incorporation into CNBr peptide 1, which contains Thr-287, and generation of the Ca2(+)-independent kinase activity. These results indicate that formation of the Ca2(+)-independent species of CaM-kinase II is dynamically regulated in cerebellar granule cells by Ca2(+)-mobilizing agents and by protein phosphatase activity and is correlated with autophosphorylation of Thr-287."
https://openalex.org/W2056081019,"One of the oldest questions of electrophysiology, the origin of the resting potential, has yet to be answered satisfactorily for most cells. Isolated frog sympathetic neurons, studied with whole-cell recording, generally have resting potentials of approximately -75 mV with an input resistance of approximately 300 M omega. These properties are not expected from the M-type K+ current (IM) or from other ionic currents previously described in these cells. In the -60 to -110 M mV voltage region, at least three currents are present: an inwardly rectifying current (IQ), a resting current with little voltage sensitivity carried at least in part by K+, and a (Na+,K+)ATPase pump current. The resting K+ current, not IM or IQ is the primary ionic current near the resting potential under these conditions. The electrogenic pump contributes an additional approximately 10 mV of hyperpolarization."
https://openalex.org/W2060281968,"beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a neurotoxic glutamate agonist possibly responsible for the neuronal degeneration found in the Guam amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-Parkinsonism-dementia complex. The basis for glutamate receptor activation by BMAA has been unclear, as BMAA lacks the omega electronegative moiety characteristic of other excitatory amino acids. We recently reported that the neuroexcitatory and neurotoxic effects of BMAA depend strongly on the presence of bicarbonate ions and proposed that an interaction between bicarbonate and the beta amino group of BMAA produces a molecular configuration appropriate for activating glutamate receptors. We now report that bicarbonate potentiates the ability of BMAA to open NMDA receptor-activated channels in isolated membrane patches. Furthermore, the neurotoxic and neuroexcitatory effects of two structural analogs of BMAA, DL-2,4-diaminobutyrate and DL-2,3-diaminopropionate, were also potentiated by bicarbonate. These findings support the bicarbonate cofactor hypothesis for BMAA action and provide direct evidence that it may be generalizable to certain other compounds."

https://openalex.org/W2008476076,"The ability to release acetylcholine (ACh) from cultured neurons of Helisoma was assessed by micromanipulating ACh-sensitive somata into contact with presynaptic neurons. ACh release was reliably detected from neurites and growth cones of cholinergic neuron B5, but not neuron 019, as early as 3 s after contact with novel target neurons. The rapid onset of transmission correlates with the ability of neuron B5, but not neuron B19, to indiscriminately form chemical connections and may be related to the specificity of synaptogenesis. The neuropeptide FMRFamide reduces ACh release at early chemical connections. The rapid onset of functional transmission and the ability of FMRF-amide to modulate chemical transmission at this early chemical connection suggest that neuron B5 acquires its presynaptic apparatus through an intrinsic program independently of target contact."
https://openalex.org/W1486466229,"Abstract Regulation of phosphate uptake was studied in HeLa cell lines after transfection with DNA encoding the human 5-HT1A receptor. Phosphate uptake was saturable and greater than 90% sodium-dependent, with Vmax approximately 30-35% without changing Km. Treatment with 5-HT or the 5-HT1A-specific agonist 8-OH-2-(di-n-propylamino)1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene increased Vmax approximately 40% without affecting Km. This effect was blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT1 antagonists, methiothepine and spiperone, or pertussis toxin. Surprisingly, the stimulation was not secondary to an inhibition of adenylyl cyclase because 5-HT stimulated phosphate uptake approximately 20% in the presence of 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP. Rather, the primary pathway linked to the stimulation of phosphate uptake involved activation of protein kinase C because (i) 5-HT measurably activated protein kinase C in these cells, (ii) activators of protein kinase C (phorbol esters and diacylglycerol analogues) stimulated phosphate uptake in these cells (iii) the half-maximal doses for 5-HT-induced phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and stimulation of phosphate uptake were virtually equivalent, and both effects were equally sensitive to pertussis toxin, and (iv) the stimulation was markedly attenuated in cells made deficient in protein kinase C. These results demonstrate that the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis by the 5-HT1A receptor can generate physiologically measurable effects on cellular transport and suggest that such accessory pathways may play a prominent role in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2097423828,"Abstract The major pneumococcal autolysin (N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase) has been localized in the cellular envelope of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli by using immunocytochemical labeling on ultrathin sections and whole-mounted cells. Cell fractionation experiments in E. coli confirmed the peripheral localization of the pneumococcal amidase and suggested that this enzyme is weakly bound to the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane. This interaction does not depend on the presence of choline but represents an intrinsic property of the amidase. The autolysin, that is synthesized without any N-terminal signal sequence (Garcia, P., Garcia, J. L., Garcia, E., and Lopez, R. (1986) Gene (Amst.) 43, 265-272) was not processed during translocation. A new regulatory mechanism that might be specific for bacterial autolysins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1539111966,"Stimulation of human T-lymphocytes via either the surface T3-Ti antigen-major histocompatibility complex receptor complex or the T11 molecule results in clonal proliferation through a calcium-dependent mechanism. To investigate this signal transduction, plasma membrane calcium-permeable channels were characterized in T-lymphocytes by means of whole cell or single channel patch-clamp recordings. Stimulation of T-lymphocytes via either structure results in opening of an identical set of voltage-insensitive plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable channels through the action of a diffusible second messenger. Previous work with excised inside-out patches suggests that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is the activating second messenger of the voltage-insensitive T-cell Ca2+-permeable channel. Since there is a significant increase in phosphoinositide turnover after stimulation via either the T3-Ti or T11 pathway, it is suggested that triggering of either structure opens a common set of channels through this mechanism. Furthermore, currents flowing through Ca2+-permeable channels are apparently autoregulated, as inward conductance is abolished by elevation of Ca2+ concentration in the bathing solution. In particular, the steady-state rise in interleukin-2 (T-cell growth factor) mRNA is dependent on the rise of [Ca2+]i resulting from ion movement across this channel."
https://openalex.org/W2093706284,"Muscular dysgenesis (mdg) in mice causes the failure of excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in skeletal muscle. Cultured dysgenic muscle fails to contract upon depolarization, lacks typical muscle ultrastructure, including normal triads, and lacks functional voltage-dependent slow calcium channels. We show that normal rodent fibroblasts and 3T3 fibroblasts ""rescue"" dysgenic myotubes, reestablishing contractions (i.e., E-C coupling), normal ultrastructure, and functional slow calcium channels. These results support the finding that the expression of the slow calcium channel is affected in the mdg mutation and that this protein is essential for E-C coupling. Additionally, fibroblast rescue provides a system for examining the mechanisms of heterotypic cellular influence on cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1551339145,"Abstract The opioid receptor preference for dermorphin and several dimerized structural analogues was investigated using rat brain synaptosomes and correlated with the potencies of intracerebroventricularly administered dimeric dermorphin peptides to inhibit gastric acid secretion. The carboxyl terminus of dermorphin or amino-terminal dermorphin analogues was bridged by dihydrazide or (poly)ethylenediamine structures. Synaptosomal membranes were prepared for radioligand binding assay in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor and preincubated to remove endogenously bound opioid peptides before storage at -70 degrees C. Specific radiolabeled agonists used in the radioligand binding assays were [D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Gly-ol5] [3H] enkephalin for mu-receptors and [D-Ala2,D-Leu5] [3H]enkephalin for delta-receptors. delta-Receptor binding assays were conducted in the presence of 2.6 microM [N-Me-Phe3,D-Pro4]morphiceptin to suppress peptide binding to mu-receptors. [D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin and dermorphin had affinities of 1.39 and 1.22 nM for mu-receptors and 355.8 and 178.6 nM for delta-receptors, respectively. Affinities of dimeric-dermorphin0 for mu- and delta-receptors, and the mu-selectivity ratio, exceeded values characteristic of dermorphin. The dimerized amino-terminal dermorphin analogues are peptides whose receptor binding differed from the parent molecule; e.g. the affinity of dimeric tetrapeptides toward mu-receptors was reduced but was increased for delta-receptors relative to monomeric dermorphin-(1-4)-amide. Dimeric tetradermorphin linked by a bridge containing 12 methylene units (di-tetra-dermorphin12), exhibited a dramatic loss in the mu-selectivity ratio as a result of diminished mu-affinity. On the other hand, substitution of Gly4 by Sar in di-tetra-dermorphin2 enhanced binding to mu-receptors: substitution of D-Arg2 for D-Ala resulted in an increased binding to mu-receptors while decreasing binding to delta-receptors, yielding a peptide with the highest mu-selectivity ratio. These substitutions of D-Arg2 and Sar4 in dimeric amino-terminal dermorphin pentapeptides enhanced binding to both mu- and delta-receptors relative to dermorphin-(1-5)-amide, but led to a decrease in its mu-selectivity ratio. Several dimeric dermorphin analogues exhibited an enhanced mu-selectivity ratio relative to their monomeric analogues. Dimeric peptides, which had a relatively high affinity for mu-receptors, were effective in the suppression of gastric acid secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1522254834,"The primary structure of tyrosine aminotransferase, as deduced from the nucleotide sequence of complementary DNA, was confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides derived from the purified protein. Limited digestion of the native enzyme with trypsin released an acetylated, amino-terminal peptide; the new amino terminus in the modified enzyme was Val65. Endogenous proteases generated a chromatographically separable form of tyrosine aminotransferase that began at Lys35. Neither trypsin nor the other proteases altered the catalytic activity of tyrosine aminotransferase. Reduction of the holoenzyme with sodium borohydride yielded a major tryptic peptide containing phosphopyridoxamine bound to lysine 280, which probably functions in transamination. The carboxyl terminus of tyrosine aminotransferase contains features that typify proteins with short half-lives; it includes two negatively charged, hydrophilic segments that are enriched for glutamyl residues and are similar to a PEST region in ornithine decarboxylase (Rogers, S., Wells, R., and Rechsteiner, M. (1986) Science 234, 364–368). Tyrosine aminotransferase belongs to a superfamily of enzymes which includes aspartate aminotransferase and can be aligned so that many invariant, functional residues coincide. Like the isoenzymes of aspartate aminotransferase, tyrosine aminotransferase may contain two domains, with a central, catalytic core, and a small domain made up of both amino- and carboxyl-terminal components. We speculate that the exposed small domain may confer the unusually rapid degradative rate that characterizes this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1486988652,"Abstract Palytoxin, a non-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate type tumor promoter, has been shown to inhibit epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to both high and low affinity receptors through a protein kinase C-independent pathway. In the present paper, we have investigated the mechanism of palytoxin action in Swiss 3T3 cells. Two lines of evidence indicate that calcium is not required for palytoxin activity. First, palytoxin can induce the loss of EGF binding sites in the absence of external calcium. Second, studies with the photosensitive protein aequorin indicate that palytoxin does not cause the influx of external calcium or the release of calcium from internal stores under the conditions used in these studies. However, palytoxin action does appear to be dependent upon the presence of sodium. When extracellular sodium is replaced by either choline, Tris, or sucrose, palytoxin is unable to decrease EGF binding to either high or low affinity receptors. Studies of sodium influx indicate that palytoxin induces rapid sodium uptake and that the rate of sodium uptake is dose-dependent. Furthermore, there appears to be a direct correspondence between the extent of inhibition of EGF binding by palytoxin and the rate of sodium uptake. Finally, the palytoxin-induced inhibition of EGF binding can be mimicked by monensin, a sodium ionophore. The specificity of this sodium dependence was tested by substituting lithium, potassium, or cesium for sodium. Although lithium is an effective substitute for sodium, palytoxin can no longer inhibit EGF binding when sodium is replaced by either potassium or cesium. Marked inhibition of palytoxin action is also obtained when 5.4 mM potassium or 5.4 mM cesium are added to the sodium-containing medium. These studies suggest that palytoxin is able to down-modulate the EGF receptor through a novel mechanism involving the activation or formation of a sodium pump or channel."
https://openalex.org/W1480925713,"The infection of HeLa cells by poliovirus leads to profound alterations in the activities of both phospholipase C and the A23187-stimulated phospholipase A2. As early as the third hour after poliovirus infection, the activity of phospholipase C is enhanced, as measured by the increase in inositol triphosphate (IP3) in the cells. By the fifth hour post-infection there is a 5-fold increase in IP3 in the infected cells. Therefore, the synthesis of the bulk of poliovirus proteins and poliovirus genomes takes place in cells containing a high and sustained increase in IP3. This augmentation in IP3 is dependent on the multiplicity of infection used. Poliovirus gene expression is required to induce the increase in phospholipase C activity, since the presence of cycloheximide or guanidine blocked it. In contrast to the activation of phospholipase C induced by poliovirus, there is a drastic blockade of the A23187-induced phospholipase A2 activity, measured as the release of [3H]arachidonic acid to the medium. This action on phospholipase A2 is dependent on poliovirus gene expression because it was prevented by cycloheximide or 3-methylquercetin. To our knowledge this is the first report analyzing these two activities in animal virus-infected cells. The findings described may help to explain the profound modifications of both membrane permeability and lipid metabolism undergone by poliovirus-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1557423637,"Using an antiserum raised against the purified atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptor that has a disulfide-linked homodimeric structure and represents one subtype of the multiple ANP receptors, we showed that the receptor is coupled to the guanylate cyclase activation; formerly, this type of ANP receptor is not considered to be coupled to the cyclase. The specificity of the antiserum was determined by immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation. The anti-receptor antiserum did not compete with 125I-ANP for binding to the receptor but it lowered the affinity of the receptor. When added to bovine endothelial cell cultures, the antiserum blocked the cyclic GMP response of the cells triggered by ANP. These results indicate that the subtype of the ANP receptor recognized by the antiserum is responsible for the activation of particulate guanylate cyclase as well as the double function type receptor that has been assumed to contain both the receptor domain and the catalytic domain for cGMP synthesis on the same molecule. The presence of dissociative complexes of ANP receptor and particulate guanylate cyclase was also demonstrated by radiation inactivation analysis."
