https://openalex.org/W1677997440,"Mutations in an intracellular region of the alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor constitutively activate the receptor, resulting in G protein coupling in the absence of agonist, as evidenced by elevated levels of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis. Remarkably, all 19 possible amino acid substitutions at a single site in this region (alanine 293) confer constitutive activity. This set of mutated receptors exhibits a graded range of elevated biological activities, apparently representing a spectrum of receptor conformations which mimic the active state of the wild type receptor. In addition to their constitutive activities, these mutated receptors all demonstrate a higher affinity for agonists, another primary characteristic of the active conformation of G protein-coupled receptors. The fact that all possible mutations at this particular site result in increased activity suggests that this region may function to constrain the G protein coupling of the receptor, a constraint which is normally relieved by agonist occupancy."
https://openalex.org/W2019864299,"The results of our in situ hybridization experiments demonstrate that sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons, and motoneurons express brain-derived neurotrophic factor and/or neurotrophin-3 mRNAs during development in mouse. In accordance with previous data, we also find neurotrophins in the targets of sensory neurons (skin) and motoneurons (muscle) and the neurotrophin receptors p75, trkA, and trkB in sensory and sympathetic ganglia. These results suggest that neurotrophins have roles other than being target-derived factors that support neuron survival during developmental cell death (neurotrophic hypothesis), but may be transported in an orthograde fashion in neurons and released from axon terminals. We discuss several novel roles for neurotrophins, including autocrine/paracrine regulation of neuron survival, regulation of Schwann cell activity, and neuron to target signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1514928695,"The TIS10 cDNA was cloned as a primary response gene transcript whose mRNA rapidly accumulates in 3T3 cells treated with serum, polypeptide growth factors, or phorbol esters. The sequence of the TIS10 cDNA suggested that the gene encodes a protein with strong similarities to prostaglandin G/H synthase/cyclooxygenase (EC 1.14.99.1). Transient transfection into COS-1 cells of an expression vector driving the TIS10 cDNA leads to production and secretion of prostaglandin E2. Microsomes prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with this construct demonstrate both hydroperoxidase and cyclooxygenase activities similar to that demonstrated by cells transfected with a vector encoding the ovine prostaglandin G/H synthase. These data demonstrate that the TIS10 gene encodes a functional prostaglandin synthase/cyclooxygenase distinct from the prostaglandin synthase/cyclooxygenase whose cDNAs and/or genes have previously been cloned from sheep, mouse, and man. The structure of the TIS10 gene, determined by a combination of sequencing of genomic clones and polymerase chain reactions from genomic clones, demonstrates remarkable exon-intron conservation with the human prostaglandin synthase/cyclooxygenase gene. A 1-kilobase sequence located immediately proximal to the start site of transcription of the TIS10 gene can confer phorbol ester and serum inducibility to a luciferase reporter gene following transient transfection into NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that this region of the gene is responsible for transcriptional regulation of the TIS10 gene by mitogens in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1572023751,"Two human liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (transferase) cDNAs, HUG-Br1 and HUG-Br2, were previously isolated (Ritter, J. K., Crawford, J. M., and Owens, I. S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1043-1047), and each was shown to encode a bilirubin transferase isozyme which catalyzes the formation of all physiological conjugates of bilirubin IX alpha following expression in COS-1 cells. Sequence data showed that the cDNAs contained identical 3' ends (1469 base pairs in length) to each other and to that of the human phenol transferase cDNA, HLUG P1 (Harding, D., Fournel-Gigleux, S., Jackson, M. R., and Burchell, B. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 8381-8385). Here we report that the two corresponding bilirubin transferases and the phenol transferase are encoded by a novel locus, UGT1, which is also predicted to encode three other bilirubin transferase-like isozymes all having identical carboxyl termini. The transcriptional arrangement utilizes six nested promoter elements, each of which is positioned upstream of a unique exon 1. Each exon 1 encodes the NH2-terminal domain (286 amino acids) and confers the substrate specificity of the isoform. The 3' end of the locus contains 4 common exons which encode the identical carboxyl termini (246 amino acids). It is predicted that six nested primary transcripts are synthesized and that each exon 1 is differentially spliced to the 4 common exons to produce six unique, mature mRNAs. Although the gene organization is present as a single copy, it provides the flexibility of independent regulation of each isoform which is known to occur in the case of bilirubin and phenol transferase activities. With an understanding of the gene structure, lethal, as well as the nonlethal defects, associated with bilirubin transferase activity can now be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1565551672,"Benzodiazepines (BZ) modulate neurotransmitter-evoked chloride currents at the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor, the major inhibitory ion channel in the mammalian brain. This receptor is composed of structurally distinct subunits whose numerous molecular variants underlie the observed diversity in the properties of the BZ site. Pharmacologically distinct BZ sites can be recreated by the recombinant coexpression of any one of six alpha subunits, a beta subunit variant, and the gamma 2 subunit. In these receptors the alpha variant determines the affinity for ligand binding of the BZ site. Notably, the alpha 1 and alpha 6 variants impart on alpha chi beta 2 gamma 2 receptors high and negligible affinity, respectively, to BZ ligands with sedative as well as anxiolytic activities. By exchanging domains between the alpha 1 and alpha 6 variants, we show that a portion of the large extracellular domain determines sensitivity toward these ligands. Furthermore, we identify a single histidine residue in the alpha 1 variant, replaced by an arginine in alpha 6, as a major determinant for high affinity binding of BZ agonists. This residue also plays a role in determining high affinity binding for BZ antagonists. Hence, this histidine present in the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5 subunits appears to be a key residue for the action of clinically used BZ ligands."

https://openalex.org/W1534683572,"We describe the reconstitution using purified proteins of the m1 muscarinic cholinergic pathway that activates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific phospholipase C via the G protein Gq/11. Recombinant m1 muscarinic receptor was co-reconstituted in lipid vesicles with either hepatic Gq/11 or with cerebral alpha q/11 and beta gamma subunits. The rate of [35S]GTP gamma S binding to the reconstituted vesicles was stimulated 20-50-fold by agonist. Maximal receptor-catalyzed binding was 7 mol of GTP gamma S bound per mol of receptor. The m2 muscarinic receptor was a poor activator of Gq/11. The binding of [alpha-32P]GTP to [gamma-32P]GTP to m1/Gq/11 vesicles indicated that the receptor could maintain up to 40% of the total coupled Gq/11 in the GTP bound state. The rate of hydrolysis of bound GTP, 0.8 min-1, is consistent with the rate predicted from the GTP binding data but is 3-5-fold lower than rates reported for other trimeric G proteins. Agonist-stimulated photo-affinity labeling with gamma-(4-azidoanilido)-[alpha-32P]GTP indicated that the receptor catalyzed binding to both alpha q and alpha 11 with about equal efficiency. Receptor-catalyzed activation of Gq/11 by GTP gamma S, measured as the ability to activate purified phospholipase C-beta 1, paralleled receptor-catalyzed [35S]GTP gamma S binding. Co-reconstitution of receptor, Gq/11, and phospholipase C-beta 1 restored GTP gamma S-dependent carbachol-stimulated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The m1 receptor, Gq/11, and phospholipase C-beta 1 are thus sufficient to initiate the hormonal inositol trisphosphate/diacylglycerol signaling pathway without additional proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1501702588,"Conserved sequences of dystrophin, beta-spectrin, and alpha-actinin were used to plan a set of degenerate oligonucleotide primers with which we amplified a portion of a human alpha-actinin gene transcript. Using this short clone as a probe, we isolated and characterized full-length cDNA clones for two human alpha-actinin genes (ACTN2 and ACTN3). These genes encode proteins that are structurally similar to known alpha-actinins with approximately 80% amino acid identity to each other and to the previously characterized human nonmuscle gene. ACTN2 is the human homolog of a previously characterized chicken gene while ACTN3 represents a novel gene product. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that ACTN2 is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, but ACTN3 expression is limited to skeletal muscle. As with other muscle-specific isoforms, the EF-hand domains in ACTN2 and ACTN3 are predicted to be incapable of binding calcium, suggesting that actin binding is not calcium sensitive. ACTN2 was mapped to human chromosome 1q42-q43 and ACTN3 to 11q13-q14 by somatic cell hybrid panels and fluorescent in situ hybridization. These results demonstrate that some of the isoform diversity of alpha-actinins is the result of transcription from different genetic loci."
https://openalex.org/W1536901694,"We and others have previously described the isolation of three human alpha (1,3)fucosyltransferase genes which form the basis of a nascent glycosyltransferase gene family. We now report the molecular cloning and expression of a fourth homologous human alpha (1,3)fucosyltransferase gene. When transfected into mammalian cells, this fucosyltransferase gene is capable of directing expression of the Lewis x (Gal beta 1-->4[Fuc alpha 1-->3]GlcNAc), sialyl Lewis x (NeuNAc alpha 2-->3Gal beta 1-->4 [Fuc alpha 1-->3]GlcNAc), and difucosyl sialyl Lewis x (NeuNAc alpha 2-->3Gal beta 1-->4[Fuc alpha 1-->3]GlcNAc beta 1-->3 Gal beta 1-->4[Fuc alpha 1-->3]GlcNAc) epitopes. The enzyme shares 85% amino acid sequence identity with Fuc-TIII and 89% identity with Fuc-TV but differs substantially in its acceptor substrate requirements. Polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrate that the gene is syntenic to Fuc-TIII and Fuc-TV on chromosome 19. Southern blot analyses of human genomic DNA demonstrate that these four alpha (1,3)fucosyltransferase genes account for all DNA sequences that cross-hybridize at low stringency with the Fuc-TIII catalytic domain. Using similar methods, a catalytic domain probe from Fuc-TIV identifies a new class of DNA fragments which do not cross-hybridize with the chromosome 19 fucosyltransferase probes. These results extend the molecular definition of a family of human alpha (1,3)fucosyltransferase genes and provide tools for examining fucosyltransferase gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1506013714,"Chaperonins are thought to participate in the process of protein folding in bacteria and in eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts. While some chaperonins are relatively well characterized, the structures of the mammalian chaperonins are unknown. We have expressed a mammalian mitochondrial chaperonin 60 in Escherichia coli and purified the recombinant protein to homogeneity. Structural and biochemical analyses of this protein establish a single toroidal structure of seven subunits, in contrast to the homologous bacterial, fungal, and plant chaperonin 60s, which have double toroidal structures comprising two layers of seven identical subjects each. The recombinant mammalian chaperonin 60, together with the mammalian chaperonin 10 (but not with bacterial chaperonin 10), facilitates the formation of catalytically active ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase from an unfolded state in the presence of K+ and MgATP. Analysis of the partial reactions involved in this in vitro reconstitution reveals that the single toroid of chaperonin 60 can form stable complexes with both unfolded or partially folded [35S]ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase and mitochondrial (but not bacterial) chaperonin 10 in the presence of MgATP. We conclude that the minimal functional unit of chaperonin 60 is a single hepatmeric toroid."
https://openalex.org/W2045827767,"Agonist-induced suppression of current in voltage-gated Ca2+ channels was studied in rat sympathetic neurons. We have previously distinguished two intracellular signaling pathways used by muscarinic agonists to suppress neuronal Ca2+ current-one fast and membrane delimited, the other slow and acting via a diffusible second messenger. We now show that the fast pathway is sensitive mainly to pertussis toxin and shifts the gating of Ca2+ channels to more positive voltages (voltage dependent). The slow pathway is pertussis toxin insensitive and depresses currents at all test potentials (voltage independent). Muscarinic agonists may also activate a pertussis toxin-insensitive fast pathway. alpha-Adrenergic agonists use the fast pertussis toxin-sensitive and the fast insensitive pathways, but not the slow one."
https://openalex.org/W1983732177,"A fast excitatory synaptic potential mediated by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was recorded in rat lateral amygdala neurons in brain slices. The synaptic potential has brief duration (tens of milliseconds), is mimicked by 5-HT, is potentiated by a 5-HT uptake inhibitor, and is blocked by selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The underlying synaptic current reversed polarity at about 0 mV. This is an example of fast neurotransmission in the mammalian brain mediated by an amine rather than an amino acid. The antiemetic, anxiolytic, and perhaps antipsychotic actions of 5-HT3 antagonists might result from blockade of such synapses."

https://openalex.org/W1598551221,"The type 1 glucose transporter (GLUT1) gene encodes an integral membrane glycoprotein responsible for facilitating transfer of glucose across plasma membrane and is rapidly activated by serum, growth factors, and by oncogenic transformation. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of regulation of GLUT1 gene expression, we isolated and characterized the mouse GLUT1 gene. DNA elements regulating transcription of the gene were analyzed in transient expression assays after transfection of NIH/3T3 cells with a low background chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) vector system pSVOOCAT. We identified two enhancer elements; the first one is located 2.7 kilobases upstream of the cap site of the gene which contains the homologous sequences with two 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elements (TREs), a serum response element, a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) and three GC boxes, and the second one is located in the second intron of the gene which contains the homologous sequences with two TREs and one CRE. With the promoter alone the transcription of the gene is activated by src, only slightly activated by ras and is not activated by serum and platelet-derived growth factor. When the gene is accompanied by one of these enhancers, the transcription is activated by all these stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1514710040,"Receptor phosphorylation is a key step in the process of desensitization of the beta-adrenergic and other related receptors. A selective kinase (called beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, beta ARK) has been identified which phosphorylates the agonist-occupied form of the receptor. Recently the bovine beta ARK cDNA has been cloned and the highest levels of specific mRNA were found in highly innervated tissues. It was proposed that beta ARK may be primarily active on synaptic receptors. In the present study, the cDNA of human beta ARK was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was very similar to that of the bovine beta ARK (the overall amino acid homology was 98%). Very high levels of beta ARK mRNA and kinase activity were found in peripheral blood leukocytes and in several myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cell lines. Since agonist-induced beta ARK translocation is considered the first step involved in beta ARK-mediated homologous desensitization, we screened a number of G-protein-coupled receptor agonists for their ability to induce beta ARK translocation. In human mononuclear leukocytes, beta-AR agonist isoproterenol and platelet-activating factor were able to induce translocation of beta ARK from cytosol to membrane. After 20 min of exposure to isoproterenol (10 microM), the cytosolic beta ARK activity decreased to 61% of control, while membrane-associated beta ARK activity increased to 170%. 20-min exposure to platelet-activating factor (1 microM) reduced the cytosolic beta ARK activity to 42% of control with concomitant increase in membrane beta ARK activity to 214% of control. The high levels of beta ARK expression in human peripheral blood leukocytes together with the ability of isoproterenol and platelet-activating factor to induce beta ARK translocation, suggest a role for beta ARK in modulating some receptor-mediated immune functions."
https://openalex.org/W1552214119,"We have reported previously the cloning of several cDNAs whose mRNAs are induced during differentiation of the adipogenic cell line TA1. Here we characterize an adipocyte-specific gene, which we refer to as FSP27 (formerly clone 47), that encodes a protein of 27 kDa, the sequence of which is unrelated to any in the current data banks. The FSP27 promoter confers adipocyte-specific expression to a heterologous reporter gene in transfected adipogenic cell lines, e.g. TA1 and 3T3-L1. Analysis of regulatory elements in the FSP27 promoter region indicates the presence of (a) a proximal palindromic sequence that is necessary for adipocyte-specific expression; and (b) a distal differentiation-independent enhancer-like element. The palindromic sequence TTCGAAA is protected from digestion by DNase I using nuclear extracts from TA1 preadipocytes and adipocytes. Heated rat liver nuclear extract, a very abundant source of the transcription factor CAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) and related proteins, generates an equivalent footprint over the palindrome. However, C/EBP can account for only a portion of the protein-DNA complexes in TA1 cells because preadipocytes as well as adipocytes contain proteins distinct from C/EBP which interact with the same sequence. We suggest that C/EBP and other C/EBP-like proteins play a critical role in regulating the transcription of the fat-specific gene FSP27."
https://openalex.org/W1865227124,"A strain of Leishmania donovani has been described that is resistant to DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (OD-Case) activity, and contains 15-fold greater amounts of ODCase activity and protein than the wild type strain from which it was derived (Coons, T., Hanson, S., Bitonti, A.J., McCann, P.P., and Ullman, B. (1990) Mol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 39, 77-90). From this mutant strain, another ODCase overproducing L. donovani strain, DFMO16, was generated by virtue of its ability to proliferate under even higher concentrations of DFMO. To investigate the mechanism by which DFMO-resistant cells overexpress ODCase, the leishmanial ODCase gene was isolated by hybridization to a fragment of the L. donovani ODCase gene that was generated by the polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequence of a 4.5-kilobase DNA fragment encompassed an open reading frame encoding 707 amino acids (Mr = 77,350). The leishmanial protein contained an extra approximately 200 amino acid NH2-terminal extension and lacked the COOH terminus of the mammalian ODCase. Northern blot analysis revealed two leishmanial OD-Case transcripts of 4.8 and 6.5 kilobases, both of which were amplified 10-20-fold in the DFMO16 cells. Genomic Southern blot analysis established that the augmented amount of ODCase activity and ODCase mRNA in the DFMO16 strain could be attributed to a approximately 10-20-fold amplification of the ODCase gene copy number. DFMO16 cells exhibited an unstable phenotype in that the amplification of the ODCase gene, the increased amount of ODCase transcript, the overproduction of ODCase activity, and the DFMO-resistance growth phenotype all reverted synchronously in the absence of selective pressure."
https://openalex.org/W1484309147,"The alpha 2-C10 adrenergic receptor from human platelets was expressed permanently in Rat-1 fibroblasts. A series of clones that varied in expression of the receptor from 0 to 3.5 pmol/mg of membrane protein were isolated. We have demonstrated recently in cells of one of these clones (1C) that the alpha 2-C10 receptor interacts directly with two distinct pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins, Gi2 and Gi3 (Milligan, G., Carr, C., Gould, G. W., Mullaney, I., and Lavan, B.E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 6447-6455). High affinity GTPase activity in membranes of cells from the various clones was stimulated by the addition of the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist UK14304, defining that the receptor coupled productively to the G-protein signaling system. Maximal stimulation of high affinity GTPase activity correlated with the levels of receptor expressed. Clones expressing the receptor also demonstrated agonist-mediated inhibition of adenylylcyclase. Futhermore, the alpha 2-C10 receptor in one clone (1C), but not other clones, promoted a marked stimulation in the generation of water-soluble products derived from phosphatidylcholine. The concentration of UK14304 required to produce half-maximal regulation of GTPase activity (20-30 nM), of forskolin-amplified adenylylcyclase activity (30-40 nM), and of choline generation (30-40 nM) were similar. Transphosphatidylation experiments with cells of clone 1C indicated that the receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine was via the action of a phospholipase D. All of these effects were attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin. Dose-effect curves of pertussis toxin-treatment demonstrated similar effective concentrations of the toxin in causing endogenous ADP-ribosylation of both Gi2 and Gi3, inhibition of receptor-stimulated GTPase activity, and phospholipase D activity. Receptor activation of phospholipase D activity was not dependent upon prior phospholipase C-dependent activation of protein kinase C, as alpha 2-adrenergic stimulation of inositol phosphate production was negligible and the presence of the selective protein kinase C inhibitor RO-31-8220, at concentrations up to 10 microM, had no effect on UK14304-mediated production of phosphatidylbutanol. These results demonstrate that expression of the alpha 2-C10 receptor in a heterologous system can result in receptor regulation of signaling elements that appear not to be primary targets for the receptor in vivo. Such results are important in respect to recent observations that transfection of a single defined receptor into separate cell lines can lead to the regulation of distinct effector systems (Vallar, L., Muca, C., Magni, M., Albert, P., Bunzow, J., Meldolesi, J. and Civelli, O. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10320-10326).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1674902677,"Amino acid sequencing of peptides obtained after proteolytic hydrolysis of Aspergillus flavus urate oxidase (uricase) permitted the design of oligodeoxynucleotide probes that were used to obtain 1.2- and 5-kilobase pair DNA fragments from A. flavus cDNA and genomic libraries, respectively. The cDNA fragment contained the entire coding region for uricase, and comparison with the genomic fragment revealed the presence of two short introns in the coding region of the gene. A. flavus uricase has around 40% overall identity with uricases from higher organisms but with many conserved amino acids. Hitherto highly conserved consensus patterns found in other uricases were found to be modified in the A. flavus enzyme, notably the sequence Val-Leu-Lys-Thr-Thr-Gln-Ser near position 150, which in the filamentous fungus is uniquely modified to Val-Leu-Lys-Ser-Thr-Asn-Ser. Silent mutations were introduced by cassette mutagenesis near the 5'-extremity of the coding sequence in order to conform with Escherichia coli codon usage, and the uricase was expressed in the E. coli cytoplasm in a completely soluble, biologically active form."
https://openalex.org/W1525251521,"The xylH gene encoding 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) has been located on a subclone of the Pseudomonas putida mt-2 TOL plasmid pWW0 and inserted into an Escherichia coli expression vector. Several of the genes of the metafission pathway encoded by pWW0 have been cloned in E. coli, but the overexpression of their gene products has met with limited success. By utilizing the E. coli alkaline phosphatase promoter (phoA) coupled with the proper positioning of a ribosome-binding region, we are able to express functional 4-OT in yields of at least 10 mg of pure enzyme/liter of culture. 4-OT has been previously characterized and shown to be an extremely efficient catalyst (Whitman, C. P., Aird, B. A., Gillespie, W. R., and Stolowich, N. J. (1991) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 3154-3162). Kinetic and physical characterization of the E. coli-expressed protein show that it is identical with that of the 4-OT isolated from P. putida. The functional unit is apparently a pentamer of identical subunits, each consisting of only 62 amino acid residues. This is the smallest enzyme subunit reported to date. The amino acid sequence, determined in part from automated Edman degradation and also deduced from the primary sequence of xylH, did not show homology with any of the sequences in the current data bases nor with any of the sequences of enzymes that catalyze similar reactions. We propose that the active site of 4-OT may be established by an overlap of subunits and comprised of amino acid residues belonging to several, if not all, of the subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1527146660,"Abstract The MAK3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is necessary for the propagation of the L-A double-stranded RNA virus and its satellites, such as M1 that encodes a killer toxin. We cloned the MAK3 gene based on its genetic map position using physically mapped lambda-clones covering nearly all of the yeast genome. The minimal sequence necessary to complement the mak3-1 mutation contained 3 open reading frames (ORFs). Only one (ORF3) was necessary to complement mak3-1. A deletion insertion mutant of ORF3 grew slowly on nonfermentable carbon sources, an effect not due simply to its loss of L-A. Although ORF3 alone is sufficient for MAK3 activity when expressed from an expression vector, in its native context an additional 669 base pairs 3' to the ORF and complementary to the gene for a non-histone protein are necessary for expression, but not for normal steady state transcript levels. This suggests a post-transcriptional control of MAK3 expression by the 3' region. The MAK3 protein has substantial homology with several N-acetyltransferases with consensus patterns h..h.h. . . Y..[HK]GI[AG][KR].Lh. . .h and h.h[DE]. . . .N..A. . .Y . . .GF. . . .. . . .Y . . [DE]G, (h = hydrophobic). Mutation of any of the underlined conserved residues (94GI----AA, 123N----A, 130Y----A, 134GF----SL, 144Y----A, and 149G----A) inactivated the gene, supporting the hypothesis that MAK3 encodes an N-acetyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1583525425,"We have studied the folding, processing, and association with two endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident proteins of the abnormal type I procollagen molecules produced by a strain of fibroblasts harboring a 4.5 kilobase deletion in an allele of COL1A2 (Willing, M. C., Cohn, D.H., Starman, B. Holbrook, K.A., Greenberg, C.R., and Byers, P.H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8398-8404). By sequencing cDNA, we found that the mutant allele encodes pro alpha 2(I) chains that are shortened by 180 amino acids but retain the Gly-X-Y repeat pattern crucial for collagen triple helix formation. The type I procollagen molecules that incorporated the shortened chain were retained intracellularly and were stable. The triple helical domain in these molecules did not attain a normal conformation and remained accessible to posttranslational modifying enzymes amino-terminal to the deletion site for a prolonged period. The abnormal molecules folded into a triple helical conformation more slowly than the normal molecules, and the amino-terminal ends of the pro alpha 1(I) chains failed to become protease-resistant. While the abnormal procollagen molecules were not bound by the ER-resident protein BiP, they stably associated with protein disulfide isomerase, the beta-subunit of prolyl-4-hydroxylase. These results indicate that some mutations in type I collagen genes both transiently delay folding and permanently disrupt the structure of the triple helix and suggest that binding to prolyl-4-hydroxylase helps to retain certain abnormal procollagen molecules within the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1563871130,"The mechanism by which cAMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation modulates the activities of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase was examined after site-specific mutation of the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation site (Ser32) to aspartic acid or alanine. The mutant and wild-type enzymes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli in a rich medium to levels as high as 30 mg/liter and were then purified to homogeneity. The kinetic properties of the Ser32-Ala mutant were identical with the dephosphorylated wild-type bifunctional enzyme. Mutation of Ser32 to aspartic acid mimicked several effects of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation: there was an increase in the Km for fructose 6-phosphate for 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and an increase in the maximal velocity of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase activity of the Ser32-Asp mutant was 75% that of the phosphorylated wild-type enzyme, the mutant's kinase reaction had an identical dependence on fructose 6-phosphate, while its maximum velocity was only 60% that of the phosphorylated wild-type enzyme over a wide pH range. Furthermore, catalytic subunit-catalyzed in vitro phosphorylation of the Ser32-Ala mutant on Ser33 increased the Km for fructose 6-phosphate by 4-fold for the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase. The results support the hypothesis that Ser32 is an important residue in the regulation of the activities of the bifunctional enzyme and that phosphorylation of Ser32 can be functionally substituted by aspartic acid. The results suggest a role for negative charge in the effect of phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1516996751,"Abstract Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) has been implicated as an intracellular messenger mediating osmotic regulation of expression of the gene encoding the neuropeptide vasopressin (VP) in the hypothalamus. We have used a heterologous transient transfection system to demonstrate that cAMP regulates the bovine VP gene promoter following transfection into CV1 cells. Mutational analysis identified a bovine VP cAMP-responsive element (BVP-CRE) 120-112 base-pairs upstream of the start of transcription. DNase I footprint analysis using nuclear protein extract from CV1 cells showed protection at the site of the BVP-CRE. Protection of the BVP-CRE was also observed using purified AP1 protein, while there was a weak interaction with the BVP-CRE using purified rat CREB protein. Nuclear proteins purified from the rat supraoptic nucleus bind to the BVP-CRE. As transgenic mouse studies have shown that the bovine VP gene is subject to appropriate physiological regulation in the mouse hypothalamus (Ang, H. L., Funkhouser, J., Carter, D. A., Ho, M. Y., and Murphy, D. (1991) Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 513, 12), these data indicate a role for the BVP-CRE element in mediating VP gene expression in vivo. These data demonstrate that cAMP regulates bovine VP gene expression in vitro via a cis-acting element within the VP promoter, and this activation may be mediated by members of the AP1/ATF/CREB family of transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1489392412,"The secreted form of Alzheimer amyloid beta/A4 protein precursor (APP) has been shown to be involved in cell growth regulation (Saitoh, T., Sundsmo, M., Roch, J.-M., Kimura, N., Cole, G., Schubert, D., Oltersdorf, T., and Schenk, D.B. (1989) Cell 58, 615-622). Using a strong prokaryotic expression system, we expressed, in Escherichia coli, peptide fragments covering different regions of the secreted form of APP-695. The longest of these fragments (KB75, 572 amino acids from Val-20 to Ile-591), which contained neither the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI) domain nor the amyloid beta/A4-protein domain, was purified and shown to be biologically active in terms of growth regulation. Two other APP fragments (KB48, 316 amino acids from Val-20 to Met-335; and RB17, 150 amino acids from Thr-296 to Pro-445), overlapping by only 40 amino acids at a close site C-terminal to the KPI insertion site, were also active. Furthermore, a chemically synthesized 40-residue peptide corresponding to this region of overlap also stimulated the growth of A-1 fibroblasts. These results establish the presence of growth-promoting activity in the secreted form of APP-695 and suggest that the site of this activity of APP-695 lies within a 40-amino acid domain next to the KPI insertion site."
https://openalex.org/W1510227168,"The role of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) phosphorylation in translational control has been demonstrated in vivo by overexpressing variant forms of eIF-2 alpha that are not phosphorylated. COS-1 cells transiently transfected with expression vectors for human eIF-2 alpha contain 10-20-fold more eIF-2 alpha subunit than the endogenous COS cell eIF-2 trimeric complex. Expression of the variant form of eIF-2 alpha, Ser51Asp, where Asp replaces Ser51, causes inhibition of protein synthesis, whereas the Ser48Asp variant does not. When either Ser48 or Ser51 is replaced by Ala, the variants stimulate dihydrofolate reductase synthesis when the eIF-2 alpha kinase, DAI, is activated. In order to elucidate these mechanisms, we have separated eIF-2 trimeric complexes from free overexpressed eIF-2 alpha subunits by fast protein liquid chromatography Superose chromatography. Pulse-labeled cells transfected with wild-type or variant DNAs produced eIF-2 preparations with greater than 10-fold higher specific radioactivity in the alpha-subunit compared to the gamma-subunit, thus demonstrating that the human eIF-2 alpha produced from the plasmids readily exchanges into COS cell eIF-2 complexes. Both wild-type and Ser48Ala variant forms of the free 2 alpha-subunit, further purified by MonoQ chromatography, are poor substrates for the heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase, HRI, but are good substrates for double-stranded RNA-activated inhibitor in vitro; the Ser51Ala variant subunit is not phosphorylated by either kinase. None of the purified free eIF-2 alpha subunits inhibits phosphorylation of eIF-2 in vitro, even at up to 8-fold molar excess. Examination of the extent of eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation in the COS cell eIF-2 complexes by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that the stimulation of dihydrofolate reductase synthesis by the Ser51Ala variant is most readily explained by failure of eIF-2 to be phosphorylated. Stimulation by the Ser48Ala variant appears to occur by mitigation of the effect of phosphorylation at Ser51 since the double variant, Ser48Ala-Ser51Asp, inhibits protein synthesis less than the single variant Ser51Asp. The evidence argues strongly against there being a second site of phosphorylation involved in translational repression."
https://openalex.org/W1532213170,"Metal catalyzed oxidation of specific amino acid residues has been proposed to be an important physiological mechanism of marking proteins for proteolytic degradation. After initial oxidative inactivation of dodecameric Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase (GS), the integrity of the GS active site and protein structure was assessed by monitoring ATP binding, observing a susceptibility of GS to tryptic cleavage, and comparative thermodynamic analysis. The tryptic cleavage rates of an active site linked central loop were significantly accelerated for the oxidized conformer. This tryptic cleavage was essentially prevented in the presence of glutamate for native GS but not for the oxidized conformer. The integrity of the ATP binding site in the oxidized GS was substantially altered as indicated by the reduction in fluorescence enhancement associated with ATP binding. Decreases in the free energies of quaternary protein structure and subunit interactions due to oxidative modification were determined by temperature and urea induced unfolding equilibrium measurements. Comparative thermal stability measurements of a partial unfolding transition indicated that the loss in stabilization free energy for the oxidized GS conformer was 1.3 kcal/mol dodecamer. Under alkaline conditions, the urea-induced disruption of quaternary and tertiary structures of oxidized and native GS were examined. This comparative analysis revealed that the free energies of the subunit interactions and unfolding of the dissociated monomers for oxidized GS were decreased by 1.5 and 1.7 kcal/mol, respectively. Our results suggest that small free energy decreases in GS protein structural stability of only 1-2 kcal/mol may be responsible for the selective proteolytic turnover of the oxidized GS."
https://openalex.org/W1574376933,"Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CD18 gene which codes for the beta 2 integrin subunit. We studied two patients, the first of which had a moderate LAD phenotype and expressed only 9% of CD11/CD18 on blood leukocytes. RNA from lymphoblasts was reverse-transcribed, and the cDNA was amplified, cloned, and sequenced. An ATG to AAG alteration in the initiation codon was detected in 39 of 45 (87%) cDNA clones. This mutation was detected in the father, but not in the mother. The maternal defect was shown to be a frameshift mutation with the deletion of a single T in the aspartic acid codon at position 690 (GAT), 11 amino acids N-terminal to the beginning of the transmembrane domain. This mutation predicts a polypeptide which would terminate without transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains. The frameshift mutation was also found in the second patient who had the severe phenotype of LAD (less than 1% of CD11/CD18), indicating that this allele does not encode a functional protein. The partial expression in the patient with a moderate phenotype must be derived from the initiation codon mutation and may be due to a low level of initiation of translation of the CD18 mRNA at the second codon (CUG)."
https://openalex.org/W1604290600,"The gene for keratinocyte transglutaminase (TGK) spans 14 kilobase pairs and contains 15 exons. Many features of the TGK gene are very similar, if not identical, to those of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of human clotting factor XIII: they have the same number of exons, corresponding introns always interrupt the coding region in the same phase of the codon, and most exons are of similar size (10 or 15 are exactly the same size). In these respects, the TGK and factor XIII catalytic subunit genes resemble each other more than either resembles the gene for erythrocyte band 4.2, a noncatalytic transglutaminase superfamily member. Exon II in both the TGK and factor XIII genes encodes an amino-terminal extension of nonhomologous sequence which in each protein confers a specialized function (membrane anchorage or activation of cross-linking, respectively). This suggests that the evolution of these genes included recruitment of a new exon to modify the enzyme action. Southern blots of genomic DNA reveal the presence of a TGK-like gene in birds, amphibians, and fish, but not in flies."
https://openalex.org/W1650110890,"At least two genes encode isoenzymes of rat 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. Alternative splicing of one of these genes generates a skeletal muscle-specific transcript from an upstream promoter and a liver-specific transcript from a downstream promoter. A potent glucocorticoid response element was identified in the first intron of the gene, i.e. between liver exon I and exon II. The element is approximately 3.5 kilobase pairs (kb) downstream of the liver isoenzyme transcription start site and 13 kb upstream of exon II of the gene and confers dexamethasone-sensitive expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity from a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter and from both homologous 5'-flanking regions of the gene. This glucocorticoid response element also exhibits androgen- but not estrogen-sensitive expression of CAT activity in HeLa cells cotransfected with the appropriate receptor expression vector. DNase footprint and sequence analysis revealed that the element is comprised minimally of two adjacent 15-mer glucocorticoid receptor dimer binding sites situated in opposite orientations. Glucocortcoid regulation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase gene expression in liver and skeletal muscle is mediated by a single complex glucocorticoid response element located in the first intron of the skeletal muscle/liver gene."
https://openalex.org/W1501839428,"The regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) by glucose and other fuel molecules has been examined in Fao Reuber hepatoma cells and Syrian hamster insulin tumor (HIT) cells in order to determine whether lipogenic substrates acutely alter ACC activity and to examine the mechanism of such regulation. In Fao cells, preincubated in simple medium without substrates, glucose addition results in a rapid activation of ACC. This effect, mimicked by other fuels such as lactate, is characterized by an increase in enzyme Vmax and a decrease in the activation constant for citrate. Several lines of evidence indicate that this activation of ACC is due to enzyme dephosphorylation, including the kinetic changes observed, the persistence of enzyme activation through ACC isolation, the necessity of inclusion of sodium fluoride/EDTA in the cell lysis buffer for preservation of the glucose-induced change, and the direct demonstration of diminished 32P-labeling of ACC after glucose exposure. Identical effects of glucose are also observed in HIT cells, although the ACC activation is smaller in magnitude and less sensitive than that observed in Fao cells. Other insulin secretagogues such as glutamine, lactate, and isobutylmethylxanthine are also found to activate HIT ACC. Others have suggested that glucose-induced changes in malonyl-CoA in beta-cells may be linked to glucose-induced insulin secretion. However, studies conducted in late passage HIT cells, which fail to secrete insulin in response to glucose stimulation, reveal the same glucose-induced activation seen in early passages, secretion-competent HIT cells, suggesting that glucose-induced ACC activation is not by itself sufficient to provoke insulin secretion. Taken together, these findings indicate that glucose and other fuel molecules can play a major role in the rapid regulation of the fatty acid synthesis pathway. The activation of fatty acid synthesis by substrate-induced ACC dephosphorylation insures ultimate fuel storage of glucose-derived carbon as fatty acid, while substrate-induced increases in the ACC product, malonyl CoA, would serve to simultaneously limit the rate of fatty acid oxidation through its allosteric regulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I."

https://openalex.org/W1489911254,"Initial rates of Na(+)-dependent L-glutamic and D-aspartic acid uptake were determined at various substrate concentrations using a fast sampling, rapid filtration apparatus, and the resulting data were analyzed by nonlinear computer fitting to various transport models. At pH 6.0, L-glutamic acid transport was best accounted for by the presence of both high (Km = 61 microM) and low (Km = 7.0 mM) affinity pathways, whereas D-aspartic acid transport was restricted to a single high affinity route (Km = 80 microM). Excess D-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine served to isolate L-glutamic acid flux through the remaining low and high affinity systems, respectively. Inhibition studies of other amino acids and analogs allowed us to identify the high affinity pathway as the X-AG system and the low affinity one as the intestinal NBB system. The pH dependences of the high and low affinity pathways of L-glutamic acid transport also allowed us to establish some relationship between the NBB and the more classical ASC system. Finally, these studies also revealed a heterotropic activation of the intestinal X-AG transport system by all neutral amino acids but glycine through an apparent activation of Vmax."
https://openalex.org/W1501964283,"A highly conserved protein motif characteristic of Class II aminoacyl tRNA synthetases was found to align with a region of Escherichia coli asparagine synthetase A. The alignment was most striking for aspartyl tRNA synthetase, an enzyme with catalytic similarities to asparagine synthetase. To test whether this sequence reflects a conserved function, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace the codon for Arg298 of asparagine synthetase A, which aligns with an invariant arginine in the Class II aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. The resulting genes were expressed in E. coli, and the gene products were assayed for asparagine synthetase activity in vitro. Every substitution of Arg298, even to a lysine, resulted in a loss of asparagine synthetase activity. Directed random mutagenesis was then used to create a variety of codon changes which resulted in amino acid substitutions within the conserved motif surrounding Arg298. Of the 15 mutant enzymes with amino acid substitutions yielding soluble enzyme, 13 with changes within the conserved region were found to have lost activity. These results are consistent with the possibility that asparagine synthetase A, one of the two unrelated asparagine synthetases in E. coli, evolved from an ancestral aminoacyl tRNA synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1531245416,"Abstract The lipid substrate specificity of Manduca sexta lipid transfer particle (LTP) was examined in in vitro lipid transfer assays employing high density lipophorin and human low density lipoprotein (LDL) as donor/acceptor substrates. Unesterified cholesterol was found to exchange spontaneously between these substrate lipoproteins, and the extent of transfer/exchange was not affected by LTP. By contrast, transfer of labeled phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl ester was dependent on LTP in a concentration-dependent manner. Facilitated phosphatidylcholine transfer occurred at a faster rate than facilitated cholesteryl ester transfer; this observation suggests that either LTP may have an inherent preference for polar lipids or the accessibility of specific lipids in the donor substrate particle influences their rate of transfer. The capacity of LDL to accept exogenous lipid from lipophorin was investigated by increasing the high density lipophorin:LDL ratio in transfer assays. At a 3:1 (protein) ratio in the presence of LTP, LDL became turbid (and aggregated LDL were observed by electron microscopy) indicating LDL has a finite capacity to accept exogenous lipid while maintaining an overall stable structure. When either isolated human non B very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) apoproteins or insect apolipophorin III (apoLp-III) were included in transfer experiments, the sample did not become turbid although lipid transfer proceeded to the same extent as in the absence of added apolipoprotein. The reduction in sample turbidity caused by exogenous apolipoprotein occurred in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that these proteins associate with the surface of LDL and stabilize the increment of lipid/water interface created by LTP-mediated net lipid transfer. The association of apolipoprotein with the surface of modified LDL was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, and scanning densitometry revealed that apoLp-III bound to the surface of LDL in a 1:14 apoB:apoLp-III molar ratio. Electron microscopy showed that apoLp-III-stabilized modified LDL particles have a larger diameter (29.2 +/- 2.6 nm) than that of control LDL (22.7 +/- 1.9 nm), consistent with the observed changes in particle density, lipid, and apolipoprotein content. Thus LTP-catalyzed vectorial lipid transfer can be used to introduce significant modifications into isolated LDL particles and provides a novel mechanism whereby VLDL-LDL interrelationships can be studied."
https://openalex.org/W1530483798,"The melB gene coding for the melibiose carrier of Klebsiella pneumoniae was cloned and sequenced. There were two potential translation initiation sites. It was predicted that the melibiose carrier consists of 471 (or 467) amino acid residues. Seventy-eight percent of the 471 amino acids were identical to the Escherichia coli melibiose carrier. Sugar transport characteristics were studied using an E. coli mel- mutant expressing cloned K. pneumoniae melB gene. Accumulation of melibiose via the K. pneumoniae melibiose carrier was not stimulated by adding NaCl or LiCl which stimulates melibiose accumulation via the E. coli melibiose carrier. Lactose was accumulated only in the presence of LiCl. TMG (methyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside) was accumulated in the absence of added NaCl or LiCl. The accumulation was stimulated by LiCl but not by NaCl. Rapid H+ uptake was observed when melibiose or TMG was added to cell suspensions. These results suggest that the preferred cation couplings via K. pneumoniae melibiose carrier are H(+)-melibiose, Li(+)-lactose, and H+/Li(+)-TMG. This coupling spectrum is quite different from that of the E. coli melibiose carrier. It is of special interest that the K. pneumoniae melibiose carrier seems to be lacking the ability to recognize Na+ which is a preferred coupling cation of the E. coli melibiose carrier for all known sugar substrates. Further investigation of these two carriers may give us insight into the Na+ recognition site."
https://openalex.org/W1575310907,"Abstract The relationship of structural and functional moieties on calmodulin is important in all venues of cell activity. In this study, we investigate the effect of lysine modification on calmodulin function. Azidosalicylate reagents containing different linker arm lengths, between the photoactive terminus and an amine-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester moiety were used to modify calmodulin lysines at three different positions in a calcium-dependent manner. The short cross-linker, (ASNE-2 (where ASNE represents azidosalicylate N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester), modifies Lys-75, whereas the longer reagent, ASNE-6, modifies lysines 21, 75, and 94. The modification of these different lysines is shown to be calcium-dependent. At 1-100 microM levels of calcium, only Lys-94 is modified, suggesting that modification of this residue is directed by both the binding of calcium to calcium-binding loops III and IV and the hydrophobic pocket exposed between these two loops as a result of calcium binding. At higher calcium concentrations (> 200 microM), where sites I and II become filled, modification of Lys-21 or Lys-75 also was observed. All the modified calmodulins were able to stimulate 3',5'-cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterase fully although the Kact for the Lys-75 and Lys-21 derivatives increased 10- and 50-fold, respectively. None of the modifications affected the activation of erythrocyte plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase. Only the ASNE-6 Lys-75 derivative showed efficient (40%) photocross-linking to the Ca(2+)-ATPase. The ASNE-2 Lys-75 derivative as well as the ASNE-6 Lys-21 and Lys-94 derivatives did not show efficient calcium-dependent photocross-linking to this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1641710874,"Abstract To study the regulation of transcription of the carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing)/aspartate carbamoyltransferase/dihydroorotase (CAD) gene from the Syrian hamster, Mesocricetus auratus, we developed a homologous in vitro transcription system on the basis of nuclear extract from Syrian hamster kidney cells. We optimized the reaction temperature and the concentrations of DNA template, KCl, and MgCl2 simultaneously with the response surface method and found an unusually low temperature optimum of 20 degrees C. We therefore investigated whether CAD transcription in vitro depended on a heat-labile component of nuclear extract. Preincubating extract alone at 30 degrees C reduced transcription from the CAD promoter but not from the major late promoter of adenovirus 2. The formation of stable initiation complexes at the CAD promoter was diminished in heat-treated extract; run-off transcripts, however, accumulated at the same rate as in untreated extract. The heat sensitivity of complex formation correlated with the heat sensitivity of DNA binding by transcription factor Sp1, which binds to two sites in the CAD promoter; moreover, both preformed initiation complexes and DNA-bound Sp1 were heat-resistant. Adding purified Sp1 to heat-treated extract restored complex formation. We propose that Sp1 activates CAD transcription by stabilizing initiation complexes at the CAD promoter."
