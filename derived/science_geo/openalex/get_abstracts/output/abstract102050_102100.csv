https://openalex.org/W1970848626,"We examined neurotrophin-induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis in cells expressing solely the low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, and in PC12 cells that co-express p75NTR and Trk receptors. Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and NT-5 stimulated sphingomyelin hydrolysis with similar kinetics in p75NTR-NIH-3T3 cells. Although brain-derived neurotrophic factor (10 ng/ml) was slightly more potent than NGF at inducing sphingomyelin hydrolysis, NT-3 and NT-5 induced significant hydrolysis (30-35%) at 0.1 to 1 ng/ml in p75NTR-NIH-3T3 cells. NT-3 did not induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis in Trk C-NIH-3T3 cells nor in cells expressing a mutated p75NTR containing a 57-amino acid cytoplasmic deletion, thus demonstrating the role of p75NTR in this signal transduction pathway. In p75NTR-NIH-3T3 cells, neurotrophin-induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis 1) localized to an internal pool of sphingomyelin, 2) was not a consequence of receptor internalization, and 3) showed no specificity with respect to the molecular species of sphingomyelin hydrolyzed. In contrast to cells expressing solely p75NTR, NGF (100 ng/ml) did not induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis in PC12 cells. Interestingly, NT-3 (10 ng/ml) induced the same extent of sphingomyelin hydrolysis in PC12 cells as was apparent in p75NTR-NIH-3T3 cells. However, in the presence of NGF, NT-3 was unable to induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis, raising the possibility that Trk was modulating p75NTR-dependent sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Inhibition of Trk tyrosine kinase activity with 200 nM K252a enabled both NGF and NT-3 in the presence of NGF to induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis. These data support that p75NTR serves as a common signaling receptor for neurotrophins through induction of sphingomyelin hydrolysis and that cross-talk pathways exist between Trk and p75NTR-dependent signaling pathways.

INTRODUCTIONThe neurotrophins are a family of growth factors critical for the survival and development of specific populations of neurons within the central and peripheral nervous systems(1Levi-Montalcini R.

Recent studies suggest that formation of high affinity binding sites requires the expression of a member of the trk gene family (8Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Theil B. Chao M.V.

The trk gene family encodes several receptor-linked tyrosine kinases, Trk A, Trk B, and Trk C, which preferentially interact with NGF, BDNF/NT-4/NT-5, and NT-3, respectively(10Cordon-Cardo C.

Similar to other receptor-linked tyrosine kinases(17Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 18Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Activation of Trk tyrosine kinase subsequently initiates multiple phosphorylation events regulating the activity of the MAP kinase cascade(20Ohmichi M. Pang L. Decker S.J. Salteil A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14604-14610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phospholipase Cγ(21Loeb D. Stephens R. Copeland T. Kaplan D. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8901-8910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase(22Obermeier A. Lammers R. Weismuller K. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22963-22966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of these downstream signaling components by Trk is critical for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells(23Szeberenyi J. Erhardt P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 187-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).In contrast to the rather restricted binding of neurotrophins to their respective Trk receptor, all of these molecules bind with lower affinity to a transmembrane protein known as the low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR(24Ibanez C. Halbook F. Ebendal T. Persson H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1477-1483.Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Rodriguez-Tebar A. Dechant G. Barde Y.-A.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). p75NTR lacks kinase activity and possesses no structural motifs recognized to couple to established signal transduction pathways(27Johnson D. Lanahan A. Buck C.R. Sehgal A. Morgan C. Mercer E. Bothwell M. Chao M. Cell. 1986; 47: 545-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 28Large T.H. Weskamp G. Helder J.C.

Nature. 1987; 325: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Although p75NTR possesses a consensus sequence for the potential binding of G-proteins(30Feinstein D. Larhammer D. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), there is little evidence supporting a p75NTR-dependent G-protein-mediated signal.Recent evidence suggests that p75NTR may also play a role in regulating cellular responses to neurotrophins. For example, p75NTR has been demonstrated to participate in the formation of high affinity neurotrophin binding sites(21Loeb D. Stephens R. Copeland T. Kaplan D. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8901-8910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Obermeier A. Lammers R. Weismuller K. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

Glass D. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1994; 13: 187-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Furthermore, specific domains in p75NTR may be involved in modulating the effects of Trk tyrosine kinase activity on cell growth and differentiation(32Verdi J. Birren S. Ibanez C. Persson H. Kaplan D. Benedetti M. Chao M.V. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 733-745Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that p75NTR may signal through a Trk-independent pathway. In this respect, NGF was found to activate a novel lipid second messenger pathway, known as the sphingomyelin cycle, specifically through p75NTR(33Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.W. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). NGF-stimulated sphingomyelin metabolism resulted in the production of the bioactive sphingolipid metabolite ceramide. Ceramide has been implicated as a mediator in antimitogenic pathways leading to cell growth inhibition, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (34Hannun Y.A. Linardic C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Indeed, in rat T9 glioma cells, exogenous ceramide mimicked the effect of NGF on cell growth inhibition and differentiation(33Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.W. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Moreover, T9 glioma cells express p75NTR but not Trk A, suggesting that activation of the sphingomyelin cycle may mediate some of the growth suppressing and differentiative effects of neurotrophins via p75NTR(33Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.W. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar).The ability of all neurotrophins to interact with p75NTRsuggested that neurotrophin-induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis may be a general signaling mechanism inherent to this family of growth factors. Therefore, in this study we examined the ability of other neurotrophins to induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis in fibroblast cells expressing wild-type or mutated forms of p75NTR. In addition, we examined the effects of neurotrophins on sphingomyelin hydrolysis in cells that co-express both p75NTR and Trk A. Co-expression of Trk A with p75NTR abolished p75NTR-dependent sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Interestingly, activation of other receptor-linked tyrosine kinases had no effect on p75NTR-dependent sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Taken together, our results indicate that the neurotrophins induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis through p75NTR and that co-expression of Trk and p75NTR modulate neurotrophin-induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRecombinant human neurotrophins were generously supplied by Genentech (BDNF, NT-3) or by Dr. Moses Chao (NT-3, NT-5). Mouse 2.5 S NGF and EGF were obtained from Harlan Bioproducts for Science. Neurotrophins were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at 4°C. Choline chloride (86 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Bacterial sphingomyelinases, bovine serum albumin, geneticin, and K252a were products of Sigma. Hygromycin B was from Calbiochem. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was obtained from Signal Transduction Labs. Rabbit anti-pan Trk antibody 203 was generously supplied by Dr. David Kaplan. Protein A-Sepharose was from Pharmacia-Biotech Inc. All tissue culture media and supplements were products of Life Technologies, Inc.Cell LinesThe production of p75NTR-NIH-3T3 cells has been described previously(9Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin B, and 50 μg/ml each of streptomycin and penicillin. Wild-type NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in the same medium in the absence of hygromycin B. PC12 cells were cultured directly on plastic tissue cultureware in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, and antibiotics. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing Trk C were a kind gift from Dr. David Kaplan and were generated by Craig Dionne of Cephalon in collaboration with Dr. Luis Parada. PS cells, NIH-3T3 cells that express p75NTR containing a 57-amino acid deletion in the cytoplasmic domain, were supplied by Dr. Moses Chao(35Hempstead B.L. Patil N. Thiel B. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9595-9598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.2 mg/ml geneticin. All cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.Metabolic Labeling and Sphingomyelin MeasurementsCellular sphingomyelin pools were labeled and sphingomyelin was quantitated essentially as described previously(36Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sphingomyelin pools were labeled to metabolic equilibrium by incubation for 3 days in medium containing 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride(37Linardic C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23530-23537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS prior to placement in either serum-free DMEM containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, (fibroblast cell lines) or DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum and 1% horse serum (PC12 cells). The cells were incubated for 4 h in serum-free or low serum medium prior to treatment with growth factors. After transfer to a 37°C water bath, the cells were treated with growth factors for the indicated times. Subsequently, the medium was removed, and the cells were fixed with 2 ml of methanol. The cells were scraped into methanol, and lipids were extracted as described previously(33Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.W. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 34Hannun Y.A. Linardic C.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42153) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the organic lipid extract were used for determination of total phospholipid phosphate (39Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or for sphingomyelin measurements. To assay for sphingomyelin, the solvent was evaporated, and the lipid residue was resuspended in 50 μl of 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2 containing 1% Triton X-100(36Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tubes were placed in a 37°C water bath, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 100 milliunits of Streptomyces sp. sphingomyelinase (50 μl). The reaction proceeded for 2 h, and the released [3H]choline phosphate was recovered in the aqueous phase of a Folch extraction(40Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure quantitative hydrolysis of the sphingomyelin by the bacterial sphingomyelinase, samples contained no more than 10-15 nmol total phospholipid phosphate. In some experiments, aliquots of the lower phase of the Folch extracts were taken to assess the amount of [3H]phosphatidylcholine present in the sample. Under these reaction conditions, the bacterial sphingomyelinase does not hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine(36Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of sphingomyelin hydrolyzed, counts/min, were normalized to either nmol of total phospholipid phosphate or in some instances to total phosphatidylcholine counts/min(37Linardic C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23530-23537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin mass measurements were performed as described previously(36Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Linardic C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23530-23537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Treatment of Cells with Bacterial SphingomyelinaseCells were seeded at 2 × 105/10-cm dish and grown for 72 h in medium containing 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride. The cells were then washed with PBS and placed in serum-free medium containing 50 mM HEPES for 4 h prior to treatment. Bacterial sphingomyelinase from Staphylococcus aureus was added to a final concentration of 100 milliunits/ml, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. This procedure has previously been shown to cleave sphingomyelin present in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane(37Linardic C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23530-23537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control treatments received 50% glycerol in 0.25 M phosphate buffer as vehicle. Cells were then transferred to a 37°C water bath and treated with either PBS or growth factors for 12 min. The lipids were extracted, and sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine levels were quantitated as above.Reverse Phase HPLC of Sphingomyelin Molecular SpeciesTo determine the molecular species composition of sphingomyelin, lipids derived from [3H]choline-labeled cells were subjected to RP-HPLC. Cells were labeled with [3H]choline as above and treated with either PBS or 10 ng/ml NT-3 for 12 min in a 37°C water bath. Following recovery of the labeled lipids(38Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42153) Google Scholar), samples were matched for total counts. Glycerophospholipids were removed by mild saponification at 37°C in 0.2 N methanolic KOH. The extracts were neutralized, the base-resistant lipids were recovered, and the solvent was removed by evaporation under nitrogen. The residue was dissolved in 50 μl of chloroform, and an aliquot was used for RP-HPLC. Samples were fractionated on a Beckman 4.6 × 250-mm octadecylsilyl column eluted isocratically with methanol, 5 mM potassium phosphate pH, 7.0 (98:2) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min(41Jungalwala F. Hayssen V. Pasquini J. McCluer R. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 579-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 70 fractions of 1 ml each were collected, and the amount of radioactivity was determined by scintillation spectrometry.Trk C AutophosphorylationAutophosphorylation of Trk C was performed essentially as described previously(12Kaplan D.R.

Trk C-NIH-3T3 or wild type NIH-3T3 cells were grown to 60-70% confluency and placed in serum-free medium for 4 h prior to treatment. Cells were treated with either PBS or 0.1-50 ng/ml NT-3 for 10 min in a 37°C water bath. The medium was rapidly aspirated, and the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 0.5 mM Na3VO4. Cell lysates were prepared by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1 mM sodium molybdate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, antipain, and pepstatin A). Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min, and cell debris was sedimented at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Aliquots were removed for protein determination using bovine serum albumin as the standard (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with 4 μl of rabbit anti-Trk antibody 203 for 2 h at 4°C.

Therefore, stable expression of p75NTR in these cells allows a direct examination of the effect of p75NTR on neurotrophin-induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis with minimal concern for an interaction with Trk receptors. We previously reported that NGF induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis in p75NTR-NIH-3T3 cells at concentrations of 50-150 ng/ml(33Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.W. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A.

Similarly, treatment of p75NTR-NIH-3T3 cells with 1-100 ng/ml of BDNF found significant sphingomyelin hydrolysis occurring at 10-100 ng/ml of BDNF (Fig. 1A). Although BDNF induced significant sphingomyelin hydrolysis at 10 ng/ml, sphingomyelin levels decreased a maximum of 30% at 100 ng/ml after 12 min of treatment. Thus, BDNF was more potent than NGF in inducing sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Additionally, both NT-3 and NT-5 showed a significantly increased"
https://openalex.org/W2101301592,"S-trans,trans-Farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS) is a novel farnesylated rigid carboxylic acid derivative. In cell-free systems, it acts as a potent competitive inhibitor (Ki = 2.6 μM) of the enzyme prenylated protein methyltransferase (PPMTase), which methylates the carboxyl-terminal S-prenylcysteine in a large number of prenylated proteins including Ras. In such systems, FTS inhibits Ras methylation but not Ras farnesylation. Inhibition of the PPMTase by FTS in homogenates or membranes of a variety of tissues and cell lines is inferred from a block in the methylation of exogenously added substrates such as N-acetyl-S-trans,trans-farnesyl-L-cysteine and of endogenous substrates including small GTP-binding proteins. FTS can also inhibit methylation of these proteins in intact cells (e.g. in Rat-1 fibroblasts, Ras-transformed Rat-1, and B16 melanoma cells). Unlike in cell-free systems, however, relatively high concentrations of FTS (50-100 μM) are required for partial blocking (10-40%) of protein methylation in the intact cells. Thus, FTS is a weak inhibitor of methylation in intact cells. Because methylation is the last step in the processing of Ras and related proteins, FTS is not likely to affect steps that precede it, e.g. protein prenylation. This may explain why the growth and gross morphology of a variety of cultured cell types (including Chinese hamster ovary, NIH3T3, Rat1, B16 melanoma, and PC12) is not affected by up to 25 μM FTS and is consistent with the observed lack of FTS-induced cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, FTS reduces the levels of Ras in cell membranes and can inhibit Ras-dependent cell growth in vitro, independently of methylation. It inhibits the growth of human Ha-ras-transformed cells (EJ cells) and reverses their transformed morphology in a dose-dependent manner (0.1-10 μM). The drug does not interfere with the growth of cells transformed by v-Raf or T-antigen but inhibits the growth of ErbB2-transformed cells and blocks the mitogenic effects of epidermal and basic fibroblast growth factors, thus implying its selectivity toward Ras growth signaling, possibly via modulation of Ras-Raf communication. Taken together, the results raise the possibility that FTS may specifically interfere with the interaction of Ras with a farnesylcysteine recognition domain in the cell membrane. This drug, and perhaps other farnesylated rigid carboxylic acid analogs, may be used for in vitro characterization of the PPMTase and for the identification of a putative Ras farnesylcysteine recognition domain in cell membranes.

According to the current widely accepted view, upon T-tubule depolarization a portion of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), the voltage-sensing protein in the T-tubule, undergoes a conformational change to make contact with the ryanodine receptor (RyR) to open its Ca2+ release channel(9Chandler W.K.

The idea that the cytoplasmic loop linking Repeats II and III of the α1 subunit of the DHPR, the so-called II-III loop, may play an essential role in this process has emerged from an earlier finding that this portion of the DHPR is the critical determinant of the skeletal muscle-type Ca2+ current(14Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This view has been further supported by recent findings that the expressed II-III loop (both skeletal and cardiac isoforms) enhanced the ryanodine binding to the skeletal muscle RyR(15Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Furthermore, a recent study with dysgenic myotubes expressing the chimeric (skeletal/cardiac) DHPR has shown that the critical determinant of the skeletal muscle-type Ca2+ transient is localized in the stretch of residues Glu726-Pro742(18Nakai J.

Triad-enriched microsomal fractions (triads) were prepared from rabbit back paraspinous and hind leg skeletal muscles by differential centrifugation as described previously(19Ikemoto N. Kim D.H. Antoniu B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Microsomes from the final centrifugation were resuspended in a solution containing 0.3 M sucrose, 0.15 M potassium gluconate, proteolytic enzyme inhibitors (0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.8 μg/ml antipain, 2.0 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), 20 mM MES, pH 6.8, to a final concentration of 20−30 mg/ml, frozen immediately in liquid N2, and stored at −70°C. Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 431 A synthesizer employing Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) as the α-amino protecting group. Peptides were cleaved and deprotected with 95% trifluoroacetic acid. Purification was carried out by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a Rainin Instruments preparative C8 column. Triads (1 mg/ml) were incubated in a solution containing 0.15 M KCl, 1 mM Mg-ATP, an ATP-regenerating system, 20 mM MES, pH 6.8 (Solution A) for 6−7 min to load the SR moiety with Ca2+. Then, 1 volume of Solution A was mixed with 1 volume of Solution B containing 0.15 M KCl, 20 mM MES, pH 6.8, and various concentrations of peptides. The Ca2+ concentration in both solutions was buffered at 3 μM using an EGTA-calcium buffer (4.22 mM CaCl2, 5 mM EGTA). The time course of SR Ca2+ release was monitored in a stopped flow apparatus (Bio-Logic SFM-3) using 10 μM arsenazo III as a Ca2+ indicator (20Ikemoto N. Antoniu B. Kim D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13151-13158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty to twenty-five traces (each representing 1000 data points) of the arsenazo III signal were averaged for each experiment. The arsenazo III signal was converted to nanomoles of Ca2+ released per mg of protein by determining the Δ arsenazo III signal/Δ [Ca2+] coefficient from a Ca2+ calibration curve. Time courses of Ca2+ release were determined at different peptide concentrations. Curves were fitted by a single exponential function, y = A(1 - e-kt), where y is the amount of Ca2+ released at time t, A is the final amount of Ca2+ released at an infinite time, and k is the rate constant of release. Rabbit skeletal muscle triads (0.5 mg/ml) or porcine cardiac microsomes (1.0 mg/ml) were incubated in 0.1 ml of a reaction solution containing 8 nM [3H]ryanodine (68.4 Ci/ml, DuPont NEN), 0.3 M KCl, 10 μM CaCl2, 20 mM Na-PIPES (pH 7.2), and various concentrations of the II-III Loop peptides for 120 min at 36°C. The incubated reaction mixture was filtered through Whatman GF/A glass fiber filters and washed twice with 5 ml of 0.3 M KCl, 10 μM CaCl2, 20 mM Na-PIPES (pH 7.2). The specific binding was calculated as the difference between the binding in the absence (total binding) and in the presence (nonspecific binding) of 10 μM unlabeled ryanodine(21El-Hayek R. Valdivia C. Valdivia H.H. Hogan K. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 779-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out in duplicate; each datum point is obtained by averaging the duplicates. Nonspecific binding was <10% of total binding. In an attempt to identify the subdomains of the II-III loop of the α1 subunit of the DHPR that play important roles in excitation-contraction coupling, we synthetized several peptides corresponding to different regions of the loop as shown in Fig. 1 and investigated the effect of each of those synthetic peptides on [3H]ryanodine binding to, and Ca2+ release from, rabbit skeletal muscle triads. Fig. 2A depicts the extent of ryanodine binding activation/inhibition (expressed as percent of control) induced by various concentrations of these peptides. Of all the peptides investigated up to a concentration of 50 μM, only peptide A produced significant activation of ryanodine binding. Increasing concentrations of peptide A progressively increased ryanodine binding to a maximal level (about 230% of control). However, peptides B, C, C1, C2, and D produced virtually no effect on the ryanodine binding. Mirroring the ryanodine binding experiments (Fig. 2A), only peptide A induced an appreciable SR Ca2+ release (Fig. 2B). Thus, at a maximally activating concentration (20 μM, see the inset to Fig. 2B), peptide A induced a significant amount of Ca2+ release from SR. However, equimolar concentrations of all the other peptides induced virtually no Ca2+ release.Figure 2:Effects of various synthetic peptides of the II-III loop on [3H]ryanodine binding (A) and SR calcium release from skeletal muscle triads (B). A, 50 μg of SR triads were incubated with 8 nM [3H]ryanodine in the absence and presence of the indicated peptide concentrations and 10 μM free Ca2+. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of three or more experiments carried out in duplicate. [3H]Ryanodine binding in the absence of peptides (control) was 1.07 ± 0.12 pmol/mg.

Data represent the average of three experiments with two different preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Peptide A produced no appreciable effects on ryanodine binding to microsomes isolated from porcine cardiac muscle (percent of control: at 20 μM peptide A, 102 ± 7 (n = 3); at 50 μM, 104 ± 11 (n = 4)). This is in agreement with the recent report that the expressed II-III loop activates the skeletal muscle RyR but not the cardiac RyR isoform(15Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the same conditions as above, in which peptide A produced significant activation, the whole II-III loop expressed in Escherichia coli(22Smith D.B. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 220-229Google Scholar) had virtually no effects on ryanodine binding nor induced Ca2+ release, unless 5 mM AMP was added as done in the original study by Meissner and co-workers(15Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that there might be an inhibitory domain counteracting the peptide A region within the II-III loop. Indeed, as shown by the experiments in Fig. 3 A and B, the presence of 50 μM peptide C, but not the other peptides (B, C1, C2, or D), produced significant suppression of the activation of ryanodine binding induced by 50 μM peptide A (Fig. 3A). Again mirroring the ryanodine binding experiments, an equimolar concentration (20 μM in this case) of peptide C produced significant inhibition of SR Ca2+ release induced by peptide A. However, peptides B, C1, C2, and D had no effect. It is particularly interesting that neither peptide C1 nor C2, which represent the two subdomains of peptide C, had any Ca2+ release blocking effect by themselves. This indicates that both C1 and C2 subdomains must be linked to exert the blocking function. Several important new properties of the II-III loop of the DHPR are revealed in this study. Most importantly, we could localize the critical site for activating the RyR/Ca2+ release channel to peptide A (Thr671-Leu690), which represents approximately one-third of the recently reported 61-residue ryanodine binding activating peptide of the II-III loop(16Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): A372Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Another important aspect of this study is the finding of peptide C, which antagonized the effect of peptide A on Ca2+ release or ryanodine binding. These results suggest that there are at least two functionally important subdomains in the II-III loop: an activator that is responsible for the stimulation of the RyR/Ca2+ release channel in E-C coupling and a blocker that antagonizes the activator. These results suggest an intriguing hypothesis as follows. In the resting state, the putative signal receptor site in the RyR is occupied by the blocker domain of the loop. Upon depolarization, the blocker domain (corresponding to peptide C) is removed from the site; then the activator domain (corresponding to peptide A) is allowed to interact with the site to trigger SR Ca2+ release. In the present study, the activation of SR Ca2+ release by peptide A was produced presumably by competitive binding with the blocker domain to the signal receptor (in the case of coupled RyR) or by direct binding (in the case of uncoupled RyR). Peptide C1 (Phe725-Gly743) used in the present study covers the 17-residue (Glu726-Pro742) region reported to be a critical determinant for the skeletal muscle-type regulation(18Nakai J. Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): A14Google Scholar), which requires a physical contact of the II-III loop to the RyR(11Rios E. Pizarro G. Stefani E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 109-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). On this basis, we tentatively propose that the C1 subdomain may behave like a hinge for this blocker/activator exchange operation. We would like to thank Drs. Renne C. Lu and Paul C. Leavis for their help in the synthesis and purification of the peptides, Dr. Timothy J. Connelly for his kind supply of the porcine cardiac muscle, and Dr. John Gergely for his valuable comments on the manuscript."

L-type Ca2+ channels containing α1C subunits with the site-directed mutations Y1463A, A1467S, or I1470A in the putative transmembrane segment S6 in domain IV (IVS6) were 6-12 times less sensitive to block by(-)D888 than control α1C.

https://openalex.org/W2056068096,"In this work, a new family of Conus peptides, the alpha A-conotoxins, which target the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is defined. The first members of this family have been characterized from the eastern Pacific species, Conus purpurascens (the purple cone); three peptides that cause paralysis in fish were purified and characterized from milked venom. The sequence and disulfide bonding pattern of one of these, alpha A-conotoxin PIVA, is as follows: [formula: see text] where O represents trans-4-hydroxyproline. The two other peptides purified from C. purpurascens venom are the under-hydroxylated derivatives, [Pro13]alpha A-conotoxin PIVA and [Pro7,13]alpha A-conotoxin PIVA. The peptides have been chemically synthesized in a biologically active form. Both electrophysiological experiments and competition binding with alpha-bungarotoxin demonstrate that alpha A-PIVA acts as an antagonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the postsynaptic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2064638709,"Angiotensin II (Ang-II) receptor engagement activates many immediate early response genes in both vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes whether a hyperplastic or hypertrophic response is taking place. Although the signaling pathways stimulated by Ang-II in different cell lines have been widely characterized, the correlation between the generation of different second messengers and specific physiological responses remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we report how in both C2C12 quiescent myoblasts and differentiated myotubes Ang-II significantly stimulates AP1-driven transcription and c-Jun.c-Fos heterodimer DNA binding activity. Using a set of different protein kinase inhibitors, we could demonstrate that Ang-II-induced increase in AP1 binding is not mediated by the cAMP-dependent pathway and that both protein kinase C and tyrosine kinases are involved. The observation that in quiescent myoblasts Ang-II increase of AP1 binding and induction of DNA synthesis and, in differentiated myotubes, Ang-II stimulation of protein synthesis are abolished by the cysteine-derivative and glutathione precursor N-acetyl-L-cysteine strongly suggests a role for reactive oxygen intermediates in the intracellular transduction of Ang-II signals for immediate early gene induction, cell proliferation, and hypertrophic responses."
https://openalex.org/W1983120244,"Following agonist stimulation, many receptors are rapidly internalized from the plasma membrane via a mechanism which presumably involves recognition motifs within the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor. We have previously demonstrated (Thomas, W. G., Thekkumkara, T. J., Motel, T. J., and Baker, K. M. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 207-213) that truncation of the angiotensin II (AT1A) receptor, to remove 45 amino acids from the cytoplasmic tail, markedly reduced agonist stimulated receptor endocytosis. In the present study, we have stably and transiently expressed wild type and carboxyl terminus mutated AT1A receptors in Chinese hamster ovary cells to identify regions and specific amino acids important for this process. Wild type AT1A receptors rapidly internalized (t = 2.5 min; Ymax = 76.4%) after AII stimulation. Using AT1A receptor mutants, truncated and deleted at the carboxyl terminus, two distinct regions important for internalization were identified: one membrane proximal site between residues 315-329 and another distal to Lys333, within the terminal 26 amino acids. Point mutations (Y302A, Y312A, L316F, Y319A, and K325A) were performed to identify residues contributing to the membrane proximal site. Mutation of Y302A, Y312A, and K325A had little effect on the rate (t = 4.3, 2.8, and 2.8 min) and maximal amount (Ymax = 81.7, 67.8, and 73.5%) of AII induced internalization. In contrast, L316F and Y319A mutations displayed an approximately 2.5-fold reduction in rate (t = 6.1 and 6.2 min) and L316F a decreased maximal level (Ymax = 38.1 and 71.4%, respectively) compared to wild type. Interestingly, Leu316 and Tyr319 are closely aligned within the hydrophobic aspect of a putative amphipathic helix, possibly representing an internalization motif for the AT1A receptor. We conclude that the AT1A receptor does not use the NPXXY (NPLFY302) motif, first described for the β2-adrenergic receptor, to mediate agonist stimulated endocytosis.

INTRODUCTIONEndocytosis of cell surface receptors is a ubiquitous eukaryotic process. It permits the internalization of extracellular nutrients (e.g. cholesterol via low density lipoprotein receptors), serves to dampen cell responses by removing ligand-activated receptors from the cell surface, and mediates cellular resensitization by recycling functional receptors to the cell surface(1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russel D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 2Pearse B. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev.

BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although some endocytosis occurs constitutively, the rate is increased dramatically following binding of many extracellular ligands to their cognitive transmembrane receptors. This process is homologous in that usually only receptors for the stimulating ligand are internalized, and of those, only receptors occupied by ligand are targeted. Homologous endocytosis predicts that receptors inherently contain within their structures and sequences determinants for internalization, and that these determinants are concealed or remain latent until agonist binding. Thus, it is generally assumed that within the cytoplasmic domains of receptors are one or more amino acid codes, or motifs, that are recognized by adaptor complexes which mediate the selective recruitment of receptor-ligand complexes into primarily clathrin-coated vesicles (3Trowbridge I.S.

Commonly, these motifs include aromatic (predominantly tyrosine) and hydrophobic amino acids, and while phosphorylation of these crucial tyrosines does not necessarily drive the internalization process, phosphorylation at other sites may initiate allosteric changes within the receptor responsible for unmasking endocytotic codes (10Sorkin A.

While the exact cellular processes and receptor motifs that control AT1A receptor endocytosis are unknown, the AT1A carboxyl terminus contains four candidate tyrosine residues (Tyr302, Tyr312, Tyr319, and Tyr326). Interestingly, Tyr302 in the motif NPXXY is analogous to Tyr326 shown to be important for β2-adrenergic receptor internalization(25Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

The serine/threonine-rich portion of the carboxyl terminus has been implicated in AT1A receptor internalization(23Hunyady L. Bor M. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol.

The construction of an AT1A receptor with a stop codon after Leu314, which codes for a receptor missing 45 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus, subcloning into pRc/CMV (pRc/TL314) and stable expression of this truncated receptor in CHO-K1 cells (TL314) has been previously described(24Thomas W.G.

Deletion of 15 amino acids (Glu315 through Ser329) from the full cytoplasmic tail was constructed in two steps. First, a 1012-base pair fragment was PCR amplified from the clone pB2/AT1A using the same sense primer as above and an antisense primer (5′-TTTCAGGAGCTCGAGGAAATACTT-3′), incorporating a XhoI site (underlined). The PCR fragment, coding for amino acids 1-314, was restriction digested with HindIII and XhoI and subcloned into pBluescript II (pB/1-314). Second, a DNA fragment, coding for amino acids 330-359, was PCR amplified from pB2/AT1A using a sense primer (5′-TCCTGTCTACGAAAATGAGCACG-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-CTACAGTCTGATGGGCCCATTTTTCTGCTTAG-3′), incorporating an ApaI restriction site (underlined). pB1-314 was digested with XhoI, blunted using mung bean nuclease and a second restriction digest performed with ApaI. The second PCR product was digested with ApaI and ligated into the modified pB1-314. The integrity of the deletion mutant construct was confirmed by sequencing and then released by an ApaI/HindIII digest for cloning into pRc/CMV (pRc/Del315-329).Point mutations were introduced into the AT1A receptor using the PCR-based method of Ito et al.(27Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Tyrosines at positions 302, 312, and 319 and lysine at position 325 were individually mutated to alanine, and leucine at position 316 was mutated to phenylalanine, using the following primers (mutated bases are underlined): Y302A, 5′-AACCCTCTGTTCGCCGGCTTTCTG-3′; Y312A, 5′-GAAATTTAAAAAGGCTTTCCTCCAG-3′; L316F, 5′-GTATTTCCTCCAGTTCCTGAAATAT-3′; Y319A, 5′-CAGCTCCTGAAAGCTATTCCCCCAAAG-3′; K325A, 5′-CCCCCAAAGGCCGCGTCCCACTCA-3′.All mutated PCR fragments were cloned into pBluescript II and the entire coding region and the relevant mutation confirmed by sequencing. Mutated receptor sequences were restriction digested with HindIII and subcloned into pRc/CMV at the same site to yield the expression plasmids pRc/Y302A, pRc/Y312A, pRc/L316F, pRc/Y319A, and pRc/K325A.Stable and Transient TransfectionsCHO-K1 cells were maintained in α-MEM containing fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin G sodium (100 μg/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml) (complete medium). CHO-K1 cells (50% confluent in 100-mm dishes) were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA for wild type or mutated receptors using the Polybrene method as described previously(24Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Transfected cultures were maintained in the presence of 800 μg G418/ml of complete medium for 10-14 days to select for plasmid containing cells, and individual clones were picked for propagation. Clonal lines were maintained under a selection pressure of 200 μg G418/ml and tested for the capacity to bind 125I-AII as described(24Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Multiple clones expressing wild type or mutated receptor were obtained. Results for individual clones, chosen for full characterization and the internalization experiments described herein, were confirmed in one or two other clones.The authenticity of the data obtained from the clonal lines was also confirmed using transient transfections. For this, CHO-K1 cells at 80% confluence, in 35-mm dishes, were transfected using the lipofectamine method, as described by the manufacturer (Life Sciences). Cells were washed in OPTI-MEM, and for each well 1 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 8 μl of the lipofectamine reagent (2 mg/ml) in 200 μl of OPTI-MEM for 20 min. The mixture was diluted to 1 ml with OPTI-MEM and placed on the washed cells, which were returned to the incubator for 5 h. The DNA/lipofectamine solution was aspirated and replaced with 3 ml of complete media. Cells were cultured for 48 h and internalization assays performed. For each transfection, 125I-AII binding assays were performed in parallel on some wells to confirm transfection efficiency and receptor expression. The level of receptor expression, extrapolated by assuming similar dissociation constants established for the clonal cell lines, was approximately 400-600 fmol/mg protein for the wild type receptors and 100-400 fmol/mg protein for the mutants.AII Binding StudiesAII binding studies were performed on cultures of transfected CHO-K1 cells in 12-well culture plates as described previously(28Schorb W. Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Conrad K.M. Chang K.C. Baker K.M. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The AII receptor binding buffer contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 μg/ml Bacitracin, and 2 mg/ml D-glucose. Receptor affinity and density were determined by competition binding studies in the presence of 40 pM125I-AII and increasing concentrations (1 pM to 10 μM) of unlabeled AII.Determination of Receptor InternalizationClonal cell lines, stably expressing wild type or mutated receptors, were grown in triplicate to confluence in 12-well culture plates. The rate and degree of agonist-induced endocytosis was determined as follows: cells were washed three times with Hank's buffered salt solution, covered with 0.9 ml of AII receptor binding buffer (prewarmed to 37°C), and the plates returned to 37°C for 30 min. 125I-AII, in 100 μl of binding buffer, was added to a final concentration of 0.4-0.6 nM, and the incubation continued at 37°C for 2, 5, 10, and 20 min. At each time point, plates were chilled on ice and washed five times with 1.0 ml of ice-cold binding buffer to prevent further internalization and to remove unbound 125I-AII. Bound 125I-AII associated with non-internalized receptors in the plasma membrane was removed by two 40-s washes with 5 mM ice-cold acetic acid in 150 mM NaCl, pH 2.5. These acid washes were retained, and the internalized radioactivity was collected by adding 1.0 ml of 0.2 M NaOH, 0.25% sodium dodecyl sulfate to each well and washing with an additional 0.5 ml of the same solution. Radioactivity in the acid-sensitive and -insensitive fractions was measured with a LKB CompuGamma counter. After correction for background radioactivity associated with the parental untransfected CHO-K1 cells performed in parallel, an index of receptor internalization was obtained by expressing the acid-insensitive counts as a percentage of the total binding (acid-insensitive plus acid-sensitive) for each well. For transient transfections, the level of internalization was determined as above, but only at the 10-min time point.Analysis of the DataNon-linear regression analysis of the competition binding data was achieved using the computer software GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.); dissociation constants (Kd) and receptor density (Bmax) were estimated as described(29Swillens S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For endocytosis assays, the percentage of internalized receptors was plotted against time, and the curves analyzed as one phase exponential associations using GraphPad Prism. The half-time (t in min) to reach a maximal level of internalization (Ymax in %) was determined for each association curve.Computer ModelingSecondary structure predictions for the carboxyl-terminal region of the AT1A receptor were obtained via the PHDsec server (Email: [email protected] ). Full description of the server and the prediction algothrim have been published(30Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar, 31Rost B. Sander C.

The various constructs are depicted in Fig. 1. Colonies resistant to neomycin (G418) were selected and propagated, and individual clonal lines expressing functional receptors were selected by the ability to bind 125I-AII. To determine if the expressed mutated receptors displayed affinities comparable to the wild type receptor, competition binding studies were performed. As summarized in Table 1 the wild type and assorted truncation, deletion, and point substitution mutants all bound 125I-AII with high affinity (Kd approximating 1 nM) indicating that these receptors attain a conformation necessary for high affinity recognition of AII. Dissociation constant values in the nanomolar range compare well with those previously reported for AT1 receptors expressed in cells and tissues(33Catt K.J. Robertson J.I. S Nicholls M.G. The Renin-Angiotensin System: Biochemistry and Physiology. Vol. 1. Gower Medical Publishing, London1993: 12.1-12.14Google Scholar). The level of receptor expression for the mutated receptors ranged between 145-840 fmol/mg protein (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Using the appearance of acid-resistant radioactivity, after addition of 125I-AII at 37°C as an index of receptor internalization, we observed that wild type AT1A receptors expressed in CHO-K1 cells underwent rapid endocytosis from the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). Shown in Fig. 2 is the internalization profile for four separate clonal lines (T3, T5, T11, and T24) expressing the wild type receptor. Although the level of expression in these clones varies over a 10-fold range (T3, 3400 fmol/mg protein(26Thekkumkara T.J. Du J. Dostal D.E. Motel T.J. Thomas W.G. Baker K.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 146: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); T24, 667 fmol/mg protein(24Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); T11, 330 fmol/mg protein; T5, 310 fmol/mg protein), the kinetics of 125I-AII internalization, fitted as one phase exponential associations, were similar for all four clonal lines (T3, t 2.1 min, Ymax 80.9%; T5, t 2.3 min, Ymax 79.4%; T11, t 2.3 min, Ymax 80.6%; T24, t 2.5 min, Ymax 76.4%). This observation indicates that the level of receptor expression does not influence the degree of agonist-stimulated endocytosis and therefore internalization parameters for the mutant receptors can be directly compared despite varying levels of receptor expression (145-840 fmol/mg protein). One of the wild type receptor expressing clones, T24, was chosen for comparison with cells expressing mutated receptors. Also shown in Fig. 2 is the markedly reduced internalization (Ymax 16.2%) of TL314, confirming our previous observation (24Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) that the carboxyl-terminal 45 amino acids of the AT1A receptor play a critical role in endocytosis. It is noteworthy that removal of 45 amino acids from the cytoplasmic tail did not prevent high affinity binding of AII, coupling to G-proteins, and appropriate activation of conventional signaling pathways(24Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Figure 2:Endocytosis of the AT1A receptor is independent of receptor density but dependent upon an intact carboxyl terminus. CHO-K1 cells stably expressing varying densities of wild type AT1A receptor (T3, 3400 fmol/mg protein, filled circles; T5, 310 fmol/mg protein, open circles; T11, 330 fmol/mg protein, filled squares; T24, 667 fmol/mg protein, open squares) or a carboxyl-truncated AT1A receptor (TL314, crosses) were incubated with 125I-AII for 2-20 min at 37°C. At the indicated times, surface-bound and internalized 125I-AII were determined by acid washing as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An index of internalization was calculated by expressing the internalized radioactivity (acid-resistant) as a percentage of the total binding (acid-resistant plus acid-susceptible). Data are means ± S.D. for three (TL314), six (T3, T5, and T11) or nine (T24) determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further define sites important for internalization (within this carboxyl-terminal region), we evaluated the capacity of another truncated receptor, TK333, to undergo AII-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 3). This mutant displayed a slower (t 6.1 min) and reduced amount (Ymax 46.3%) of internalization compared to the wild type T24 (t 2.5 min, Ymax 76.4%), implicating the terminal 26 amino acids in the internalization process. However, the level of internalization observed for TK333 was consistently greater than that observed for TL314 (Ymax 46.3 versus 16.2% (see Fig. 2)), which suggested that the region between Leu314 and Lys333 also contained an endocytotic determinant. To confirm this, a deletion mutant was constructed in which the terminal 30 amino acids(330-359) were fused to the first 314 residues, deleting amino acids 315-329. As shown in Fig. 3125I-AII was slowly (t = 8.6 min) internalized by this mutant, to a degree (Ymax = 40.9%) slightly less than that displayed by TK333. These observations suggest that there are two sites important for endocytosis within the carboxyl terminus of the AT1A receptor; one distal to Lys333 and another in the region 315-329.Figure 3:Two separate regions of the AT1A receptor carboxyl terminus are important for endocytosis. Internalization kinetics for the wild type AT1A receptor (filled circles) and truncated (TK333, open circles) and deletion (Del315-329, squares) mutants were obtained as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that the PAF acetylhydrolase activity present in the soluble fraction of bovine brain cortex could be separated chromatographically into three peaks (tentatively designated isoforms Ia, Ib, and II) (Hattori, M., Arai, H., and Inoue, K.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 18748-18753). In this study, these three isoforms were also detected in kidney and liver cytosols, although their relative activity ratios in these tissues differed. In particular, isoform II was responsible for the majority of the bovine liver PAF acetylhydrolase activity. We purified isoform II from bovine liver cytosol to near homogeneity and demonstrated that it is a single 40-kDa polypeptide. This enzyme was inactivated by diisopropyl fluorophosphate and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), suggesting that both serine and cysteine residues are required for the enzyme activity, and [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate labeled only the 40-kDa polypeptide, confirming the enzyme's identity. Isoform II showed a comparatively broader substrate specificity than isoform Ib. Isoform II hydrolyzed propionyl and butyroyl moieties at the sn-−2 position approximately half as effectively as it did PAF, whereas isoform Ib hardly hydrolyzed these substrates.Taken together with previous data, the current findings indicate that tissue cytosol contains at least two types of PAF acetylhydrolase with respect to polypeptide composition, substrate specificity, and tissue distribution and suggest that these two enzymes may share distinct physiological functions in tissues.

Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17381-17384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its inactivation is catalyzed by a specific acetylhydrolase, which removes the acetyl group at the sn-−2 position of the glycerol backbone, to produce the biologically inactive lyso-PAF(10Farr R.S.

For example, human macrophages regulate PAF accumulation by altering intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase activity levels(12Elstad M.R. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J.

We found that at least three isoforms (tentatively designated Ia, Ib, and II) of PAF acetylhydrolase existed in bovine brain and that isoform Ib, which was the most abundant, was a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of 29-, 30- and 45-kDa subunits(19Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of these subunits, the 29-kDa one served as the catalytic center, as only this subunit was labeled by [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), a potent inhibitor of the enzyme(19Hattori M. Arai H.

The amino acid sequence deduced from its cDNA is unique and not homologous with those of any other known phospholipases and lipases. In the current study, we purified another isoform (isoform II) of PAF acetylhydrolase from bovine liver and showed that intracellular PAF acetylhydrolases Ib and II are distinct proteins with different substrate specificities and tissue distributions. 1-O-Hexadecyl-2-[3H]acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([3H]acetyl-PAF), 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-[1-14C]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-O-[1-14C] hexadecyl-lyso-PAF and diisopropyl fluorophosphate ([3H]DFP) were purchased from DuPont NEN.

The specific activity of labeled lyso-PAF was adjusted to 4,000 dpm/nmol by dilution with unlabeled lyso-PAF. The sn-−2 short chain phospholipids were synthesized by the coupling method of Gupta et al.(21Guota C.M. Radhakrishnan R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To a suspension of 4 μmol of labeled lyso-PAF in 0.4 ml of chloroform/pyridine (4:1 v/v), 2 mg of 4-(N,N‘-dimethylamino)pyridine and 40 μmol each of acid anhydride were added and stirred for 18 h. The product was extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) under mild alkline and acidic conditions three times each and then purified by silica gel plate, using chloroform/methanol/ammonia solution (65:25:5, v/v) as the mobile phase. The specific activity of [3H]acetyl-PAF was adjusted to 3,200 dpm/nmol by dilution with unlabeled PAF. The standard incubation system for assaying PAF acetylhydrolase comprised 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-ME, 20 nmol of [3H]-acetyl-PAF, and the sample in a total volume of 0.25 ml. After incubation for 30 min at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v) and 0.25 ml of water. The radioactivity of an aliquot (0.6 ml) of each upper phase was measured to determine the amount of acetate liberated.

The bands corresponding to the substrate and lyso-PAF were scraped off and examined for radioactivity. Hydrolytic activities with phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine as the substrates were determined using the same buffer containing 20 nmol of labeled substrate as described above. The labeled free fatty acid was released by each reaction was extracted by the method described previously (19Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol.

All procedures were carried out at 0-4°C. The livers were homogenized with a Waring blender in five volumes of homogenizing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to remove the bulk of the solid material. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the soluble fraction (supernatant), which was adjusted to 1 M with NaCl, stirred for 15 min, and applied to a butyl-Toyopearl 650M column preequilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, and 1 M NaCl. The column was washed with this buffer, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (1-0 M). The PAF acetylhydrolase activity was eluted as a single peak among the 1-0 M NaCl fractions. The active fractions from the butyl-Toyopearl column were applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, and 20% (v/v) glycerol (buffer A). The column was washed with buffer A, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-500 mM) in buffer A. The activity was present among the fractions eluted by about 300 mM NaCl. The active fractions from the Q-Sepharose column were concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell using a YM-10 membrane to approximately 6 ml. This concentrated fraction was applied to a Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration column preequilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-ME, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS (buffer B). The activity was eluted as a single peak in a fraction corresponding to molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa. The active fractions from the Bio-Gel A-1.5m column were applied to a hydroxylapatite column preequilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM 2-ME, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS (buffer C). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient from buffer C alone to buffer C containing 150 mM KH2PO4. The activity was present among the fractions eluted by about 50 mM KH2PO4. The active fractions from the hydroxylapatite column were dialyzed against buffer C and then applied to a FPLC Mono Q HR 5/5 column preequilibrated with buffer C and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-500 mM) in buffer C. The activity was present among the fractions eluted by 250 mM NaCl. Partial purification of PAF acetylhydrolase II from liver, kidney, and brain was carried out by sequential column chromatographies using butyl-Toyopearl, DEAE- Sepharose CL-6B, and Bio-Gel A-0.5m. Each partially purified PAF acetylhydrolase II (corresponding to an activity of 5 nmol/min) was incubated with [3H]DFP (5 μCi, 0.58 nmol) in 50 μl of buffer B for 30 min at 25°C. Then, 25 μl of Laemmli sampling buffer (0.19 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 30% (v/v) glycerol, 6% (v/v) SDS, 15% (v/v) 2-ME, 0.04 mg/ml bromphenol blue) were added, followed by incubation for 10 min at 90°C. Then, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was carried out, using an 11% acrylamide slab gel as described by Laemmli, after which the gel was washed for 15 min with 30% (v/v) methanol containing 7.5% (v/v) acetic acid, impregnated with ENHANCE (DuPont NEN), dried under vacuum, and then autoradiographed using Kodak XRP-5 film for 3 days at −70°C with an intensifying screen. Approximately 0.2 mg of purified liver enzyme was reduced with 1 mg of dithiothreitol for 2 h at room temperature and then S-alkylated with 0.6% (w/v) 4-vinylpyridine for 2 h at room temperature. This reaction mixture was applied to a reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with a 4.6 mm × 250-mm Vydac 304-1251 C4 column preequilibrated with 20% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (20-85% v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The HPLC-purified 40-kDa polypeptide was dialyzed against lysyl endopeptidase digestion buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 4 M urea). Then, 1 μg of lysyl endopeptidase was added to the sample, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 18 h at 37°C, followed by separation by reverse-phase HPLC on a 4.6 mm × 250-mm Vydac 304-1251 C4 column using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (5-70% v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The amino acid sequences of the peptide fragments were determined using an Applied Biosystems model 477A automated sequenator. The soluble fractions obtained from bovine brain, kidney, and liver exhibited significant levels of PAF acetylhydrolase activity; the respective specific activities of these fractions were approximately 0.8, 1.2, and 1.4 nmol/min/mg, none of these activities were affected by EDTA. This level of activity was not detected in any of these tissues when phosphatidylcholine with two long acyl chains was used as a substrate. Next, these soluble fractions were subjected to DEAE-Sepharose followed by hydroxylapatite column chromatography (Fig. 1). The kidney and liver PAF acetylhydrolase activities separated into three peaks, as did brain PAF acetylhydrolase activity. Activity was present in two peaks among the fractions eluted by about 150 and 300 mM NaCl from the DEAE column (corresponding to peaks I and II, respectively, of brain PAF acetylhydrolase), although peak I of the liver fraction was very small. The peak I fractions of liver and kidney were both separated into two peaks by hydroxylapatite chromatography (corresponding to peaks Ia and Ib of brain PAF acetylhydrolase). Therefore, these data indicate that bovine kidney and liver possess the same set of isoforms as bovine brain. In contrast to the brain, abundant peak II activity was present in the soluble fractions of kidney and liver. Remarkably, peak II was responsible for most of the PAF acetylhydrolase activity in the liver. No other peak showing activity was observed in the soluble fractions of the kidney or liver during the sequential chromatography. As isoform II was the most abundant PAF acetylhydrolase isoform in the liver soluble fraction, we employed this tissue as a starting material for subsequent purification of the enzyme. First the liver soluble fraction was subjected to butyl-Toyopearl hydrophobic column chromatography. The PAF acetylhydrolase activity was adsorbed to the column with a buffer containing 1 M NaCl and then eluted with buffer containing 1 mM EDTA. The elution profile of this fraction contrasted markedly with that of isoform Ib in the brain(19Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is not adsorbed to butyl-Toyopearl under the conditions. The activity was eluted as a single peak by the subsequent chromatography using Q-Sepharose, gel filtration, hydroxylapatite and Mono Q FPLC columns. When the enzyme was chromatographed on a Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration column using a conventional buffer, the activity was eluted as a broad peak with extremely low recovery. In contrast, the activity was eluted as a sharp peak at the region corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa when a detergent (CHAPS) was included in the running buffer (data not shown). Moreover, the recovery was over 80% of the starting material under the latter conditions. Therefore, we used a buffer containing CHAPS for purification after Q-Sepharose chromatography. A typical elution profile of the activity and the SDS-PAGE pattern of the fraction after the final step, Mono Q FPLC chromatography, are shown in Fig. 2. A single major 40-kDa protein comigrated with PAF acetylhydrolase activity. In fact, this band was found to comigrate with the activity during every chromatographic procedure after the gel filtration column step. The purification procedure is summarized in Table 1. The overall purification was about 4,000-fold, and the recovery was 3%.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Various compounds were tested for their effects on the activity of the purified PAF acetylhydrolase II. Among the agents tested, DFP (1 mM), an active serine-blocking reagent, and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (1 mM), a sulfhydryl-blocking agent, almost abolished the activity of the purified PAF acetylhydrolase II (data not shown). These data indicate strongly that both serine and cysteine residues are required for enzyme activity of PAF acetylhydrolase II. Involvement of free sulfhydryl groups in the catalysis was also supported by the fact that the addition of 10 mM 2-ME reversed the inhibitory effect of DTNB (data not shown). Sodium fluoride has been reported to inhibit partially rat lung cytosolic PAF acetyl hydrolase(23Nijssen J.G. Roosenbloom C.F.P. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 876: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and Stafforini et al. (17Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have shown that PAF acetylhydrolase in human erythrocytes is very sensitive to sodium fluoride. We tested the effect of sodium fluoride on purified PAF acetylhydrolase II, which we found was quite resistant to this agent over a wide range of concentrations (data not shown), in agreement with the observation of Stafforini et al. (17Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that PAF acetylhydrolase activity in rat liver is resistant to sodium fluoride. Based on the fact that, due to the charge relay network, the only highly reactive serine residues can react with DFP, we identified the catalytic subunit of trimeric PAF acetylhydrolase Ib(19Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the same strategy, we tested whether the purified 40-kDa polypeptide has an active serine residue, by incubating the purified enzyme fraction with [3H]DFP, followed by fluorographic analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 the purified 40-kDa polypeptide did incorporate [3H]DFP, confirming it possesses an active serine residue. The specific labeling of the 40-kDa polypeptide with [3H]DFP was seen even in the fraction obtained after the gel filtration step. 2K. Hattori, M. Hattori, H. Adachi, M. Tsujimoto, H. Arai, and K. Inoue, unpublished observation. The same bands were also labeled with [3H]DFP when partially purified isoforms II obtained from bovine brain and kidney were used (Fig. 3 lanes C and D). Therefore, the peak II fractions from the kidney and brain probably contained isoform II with the same polypeptide structure as that of the liver. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified 40-kDa polypeptide could not be determined, possibly because some modification of the N-terminal amino group occurred. Therefore, we treated this polypeptide with lysyl endopeptidase, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequence of the N-terminal residues of one fragment was (K)EEWIPHRQIEE (Fig. 4). A search using a protein sequence data bank indicated that there were no perfect matches of this stretch of amino acids with any sequences present in the data bank. In order to examine the different characteristics of PAF acetylhydrolases II and Ib, various PAF derivatives were tested for their substrate activity (Fig. 5). First, both isoforms II and Ib were found to have little or no hydrolytic activity when phosphatidylcholine with two long acyl chains was the substrate, irrespective of the presence of calcium ions, a common activator of phospholipase A2. Next, derivatives of [14C]lyso-PAF containing sn-−2 fatty acyl residues of increasing chain length were synthesized and tested as substrates for the purified PAF acetylhydrolases II and Ib. The purified PAF acetylhydrolase II hydrolyzed acyl groups that were 3 (propionyl) and 4 (butyroyl) carbon atoms long about half and one-third, respectively, as efficiently as it did PAF. The addition of a carboxylic acid function to the ω-terminal carbon of the sn-−2 fatty acid residue did not seem to increase the substrate hydrolytic activity of the enzyme, although these substrates can be hydrolyzed by the enzyme at a significant rate. When the sn-−2 residue was longer than 2 carbon atoms, the catalytic efficiency of PAF acetylhydrolase Ib was dramatically reduced. The PAF homologue with a propionyl residue at the sn-−2 position was hydrolyzed only 10% as efficiently as PAF and that with a butyroyl residue had virtually no substrate activity. This substrate specificity shows that PAF acetylhydrolase Ib behaves as a specific acetylhydrolase. Therefore, PAF acetylhydrolases II and Ib can be differentiated from each other by their different substrate specificities In the current study, we purified another type of intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase from bovine liver and showed that it was a single 40-kDa polypeptide. Moreover, we found that the relative ratios of these two enzymes in bovine tissues differed. We demonstrated previously that the PAF acetylhydrolase activity present in the cytosolic fraction of bovine brain cortex separated chromatographically into three peaks (designated peaks Ia, Ib, and II) and that the enzyme in peak Ib was a heterotrimer comprising 29-, 30- and 45-kDa polypeptides(19Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme belong to a novel serine esterase family: both the 29- and 30-kDa subunits have a catalytic serine residue (20Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23150-23155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3K. Hattori, M. Hattori, H. Adachi, M. Tsujimoto, H. Arai, and K. Inoue, submitted for publication. In contrast, PAF acetylhydrolase II (in the peak II fraction) appears to be a monomeric enzyme. It is, however, too early to be absolutely certain that this is the case, as we could obtain only a sharp single peak of activity by gel filtration chromatography in the presence of a certain detergent (CHAPS). Consistent with these data, Stafforini et al. (14Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Lipids. 1991; 26: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed that PAF acetylhydrolase from rat liver cytosol was eluted in a relatively broad peak when subjected to Sephadex G-200 gel filtration chromatography. The chromatographic behavior on a butyl-Toyopearl hydrophobic column suggested that PAF acetylhydrolase II is more hydrophobic in nature than PAF acetylhydrolase Ib. The former enzyme may be associated with some other cytosolic component(s). It should be noted that human plasma PAF acetylhydrolase, a 44-kDa monomer, is associated with plasma lipoproteins, such as low and high density lipoproteins, and cannot be dissociated from them without detergent (24Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4223-4230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The suggestion that PAF acetylhydrolases Ib and II are distinct enzymes is also supported by the amino acid sequence data. The catalytic components of PAF acetylhydrolase Ib, the 29- and 30-kDa subunits, are novel proteins with no significant homology with other known proteins. The partial amino acid sequence of the 40-kDa PAF acetylhydrolase II matches neither those of these polypeptides nor any other protein reported so far. Very recently, the cDNA for human plasma PAF acetylhydrolase was cloned and sequenced(26Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Both plasma and intracellular (isoform Ib) enzymes belong to the serine esterase family, but otherwise these proteins showed no sequence similarities, and no identical sequences in the plasma enzyme and intracellular enzyme isoform II were observed. Northern blot analysis of human tissues using the cDNA for the plasma enzyme revealed that signals was hardly detected in the human liver or kidney, whereas in both these bovine tissues, PAF acetylhydrolase II is the most abundant isoform. These findings also support the hypothesis that the plasma enzyme and isoform II are distinct proteins. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of PAF acetylhydrolase from human erythrocytes has been reported(18Stafforini D.M. Rollins E.N. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3857-3865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite repeated attempts to determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified PAF acetylhydrolase II, we were unable to do so, possibly because some modification of the N-terminal amino group occurred. The erythrocyte enzyme appears to be a homodimer consisting of the 25-kDa polypeptide(18Stafforini D.M. Rollins E.N. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3857-3865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the elution positions of the liver and erythrocyte PAF acetylhydrolases indicated that these two activities could be differentiated from each other. All these data support the concept that PAF acetylhydrolase from erythrocyte cytosol is not identical to PAF acetylhydrolase II. Aarsman et al. (27Aarsman A.J. Neys F.W. van den Bosh H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) reported that two lysophospholipases (I and II) existed in bovine liver cytosol and that lysophospholipase II, the molecular mass of which SDS-PAGE showed was 63 kDa, had intrinsic PAF acetylhydrolase activity, although deacetylation of PAF was five times slower than deacylation of lysophospholipid. We tested whether the purified PAF acetylhydrolase II possessed lysophospholipase activity using 1-palmitoyl-glycerophosphocholine as a substrate and found that this enzyme was unable to split acyl chains attached to the sn-−1 position of glycerophospholipid. According to our purification data, over 70% of the original activity was lost during the first chromatographic step, when lysophospholipase II might have been separated from PAF acetylhydrolase II. Recently, we found that peak Ia obtained after hydroxylapatite chromatography of peak I was a 60-kDa enzyme consisting of 29- and 30-kDa polypeptides. These polypeptides are immunochemically identical to the corresponding subunits of isoform Ib,2 indicating that these two isoforms are mutually related. Thus, at present, it can be concluded that the intracellular type of PAF acetylhydrolase comprises at least three groups of enzymes, PAF acetylhydrolases I (Ia and Ib), PAF acetylhydrolase II, and erythrocyte-type PAF acetylhydrolase. We showed previously that one subunit (45 kDa) of isoform Ib is identical to the product of the causative gene for Miller-Dieker lissencephaly, a human brain malformation that manifests a smooth cerebral surface and abnormal neuronal migration(28Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Nature. 1994; 370: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). This study raised the possibility that the migration of neuronal cells during brain development is regulated by PAF (or a PAF-like phospholipid), and a defect in PAF acetylhydrolase Ib results in defective or unregulated PAF metabolism in the cells. It should be noted that the catalytic subunit of isoform Ib possesses a sequence of about 30 amino acids located 6 residues downstream from the active serine site, which exhibits significant homology to the first transmembrane region of the PAF receptor(20Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23150-23155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas plasma PAF acetylhydrolase does not possess such a region(26Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear whether this domain is involved in substrate binding, such a sequence in the catalytic subunit may confer the property of specific recognition of PAF on isoform Ib. The function of isoform II is unknown at present. Isoform II was found to have a relatively broad substrate specificity compared with isoform Ib; the former hydrolyzed butyl, propyl, succinoyl, and glutaroyl groups attached to the sn-−2 position of PAF appreciably, but the latter did not. The substrate specificity of isoform II resembles that of plasma PAF acetylhydrolase rather than isoform Ib. A potential role of PAF acetylhydrolase is thought to be degradation of toxic products of lipid peroxidation, such as oxidatively fragmented phospholipids(18Stafforini D.M. Rollins E.N. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3857-3865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol.

Since erythrocytes have no ability to produce PAF, it is reasonable to infer that the function of erythrocyte PAF acetylhydrolase may be to scavenge oxidatively damaged phospholipids produced in the cells. Intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase II may also provide a mechanism to protect the tissues against oxidative damage, as it would recognize and degrade oxidized species without acting on structural membrane phospholipids. In this context, it would be interesting to consider that the liver and kidney, both of which are abundant in isoform II, are known to be rich in superoxide dismutase. The next challenge is to clarify the structural and functional differences of the two distinct intracellular PAF acetylhydrolases."

https://openalex.org/W2016186068,"Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is the carrier of fatty acids during their synthesis and utilization. ACPs (or ACP-like protein domains) have been found throughout biology and share significant amino acid sequence similarities. All ACPs undergo a post-translational modification in which 4′-phosphopantetheine is transferred from CoA to a specific serine of apo-ACP. This modification is essential for activity because fatty acids are bound in thioester linkage to the sulfhydryl of the prosthetic group. Overproduction of Escherichia coli ACP from multicopy plasmids strongly inhibits growth of E. coli. We report that upon overexpression of ACP in E. coli post-translational modification is inefficient and the apo protein accumulates and blocks cell growth by inhibition of lipid metabolism. Moreover, a mutant form of ACP that is unable to undergo post-translational modification is a potent inhibitor of growth. Finally, we observed that an increase in the efficiency of modification of overexpressed ACP results in decreased toxicity. The accumulated apo-ACP acts as a potent in vitro inhibitor of the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase resulting in an inability to transfer the completed fatty acid to sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. The degree of inhibition depended upon the species of donor acyl chain. Utilization of cis-vaccenoyl-ACP by the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase was inhibited to a much greater extent by apo-ACP than was utilization of palmitoyl-ACP. 1-Acyl glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase was also inhibited in vitro by apo-ACP, although not at physiologically relevant concentrations. These in vitro data are supported by in vivo labeling data, which showed a large decrease in cis-vaccenate incorporation into phospholipid during overproduction of ACP, but no decrease in the rate of synthesis of long chain acyl-ACPs. These data indicate that acylation of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate is the major site of inhibition by apo-ACP.

Fatty acid synthesis in Escherichia coli is the prototypical type II fatty acid system in which each cycle of condensation, reduction, dehydration, and further reduction are catalyzed by a group of monofunctional polypeptides (for a review, see Magnuson et al.(1993)). The growing fatty acid moves among these enzymes not as a free carboxylic acid, but in a form covalently linked to a protein called acyl carrier protein (ACP). 1The abbreviations used are: ACPacyl carrier proteinCoAcoenzyme AMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosideG3Psn-glycerol 3-phosphate. Upon completion of acyl chain synthesis, ACP serves as the carrier of the mature fatty acid during subsequent transfer to sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) and lipid A.

ACP has been found to play an essential part in a growing number of processes outside of fatty acid biosynthesis. In Rhizobia, a specialized ACP is required in the acylation of oligosaccharides required for nodulation (Spaink et al., 1991). In Streptomyces, either an ACP or an ACP-like domain is required for the synthesis of polyketide antibiotics (Hopwood and Sherman, 1990). ACP or ACP-like domains have also been found to act as carriers of activated amino acids during synthesis of non-ribosomally synthesized antibiotics (Lipman, 1980) and lipoteichoic acids (Heaton and Neuhaus, 1993). In E. coli, ACP has been found in vitro to be essential for the transglucosylation reaction required in the synthesis of membrane-derived oligosaccharides (Therisod and Kennedy, 1987). However, the synthesis of these oligosaccharides seems to be distinct from the reactions mentioned above in that apo-ACP is active as a cofactor for this enzyme. E. coli ACP is a low molecular mass (8,860 Da) (Magnuson et al., 1993), acidic (pI 4.1) (Vandenboom and Cronan, 1989), very abundant (˜6 × 104 molecules/cell) cytoplasmic protein. Although the crystal structure has not been determined, NMR studies have indicated that ACP exists in solution as a rod shaped protein made up of four α helices that interact to form a hydrophobic cleft capable of accommodating the prosthetic group and up to 6 carbons of the growing fatty acid chain. The structure of the molecule is stabilized upon acylation, most likely through interactions between the fatty acyl chain and hydrophobic faces of the helices (Magnuson et al., 1993). ACP is synthesized as an apo protein, which undergoes post-translational modification by the addition of a 4′-phosphopantetheine, to serine 36 of the amino acid backbone (for a review, see Magnuson et al.(1993)). This post-translational modification is catalyzed by holo-ACP synthase. This enzyme uses CoA as the 4′-phosphopantetheine donor and specifically modifies serine 36 of ACP. The growing fatty acid chain is attached to the terminal sulfhydryl group of the phosphopantetheine, the only sulfhydryl group of E. coli ACP. All known ACP (or ACP-like domains) undergo this modification and all share sequence similarity around the modified serine (Vanden Boom and Cronan, 1989). Mutants impaired in the ability to post-translationally modify ACP remain viable despite having only one third of their ACP present in the functional form, suggesting that ACP is present in E. coli in functional excess (Vanden Boom and Cronan, 1989). The prosthetic group of ACP is turned over rapidly in vivo as a result of the action of the enzyme ACP phosphodiesterase. This enzyme catalyzes the removal of the prosthetic group from ACP, resulting in free 4′-phosphopantetheine and apo-ACP. The activity of this enzyme appears to be stimulated by decreasing CoA levels (Magnuson et al., 1993), but little is known about the role of ACP phosphodiesterase in normal E. coli physiology. The gene encoding this enzyme has not been cloned, and no mutants exist (Magnuson et al., 1993). Holo-ACP synthase and ACP phosphodiesterase constitute a futile cycle, and previous workers (Elovson and Vagelos, 1975) have suggested that the action of this cycle would be a likely point of regulation. However, later experiments have not supported this prediction (Jackowski and Rock, 1983). Cloning of the gene (acpP) encoding ACP was long precluded due to the inability to stably maintain the gene in high copy number plasmids (Vanden Boom et al., 1989). This instability was first recognized through use of a synthetic gene encoding ACP to be the direct result of overexpression of the gene product. This result was unexpected in that ACP is a very abundant and extremely soluble protein. Moreover ACPs from other organisms have been overproduced in E. coli (albeit at lower levels) without the associated toxicity (Guerra et al., 1988). We have examined the cause of this toxicity and have determined that overexpressed ACP is incompletely post-translationally modified and that the unmodified apo-ACP is a powerful and specific inhibitor of lipid metabolism. All strains used in this work are derivatives of E. coli K-12. Strain MP3 (panB6 fadE tsx Δ (bio-gal)) (Polacco and Cronan, 1981) was transformed with both pMR19 and pMS421 to yield strain DK552. Plasmid pMR19 contains a synthetic version of the acpP gene under control of the tac promoter (Rawlings, 1993) and was derived from plasmid pKK223-3 (Brosius and Holy, 1984). Plasmid pMS421 (Grana et al., 1988) contains the lacIq mutation and was used to regulate transcription of the acpP gene. Strain MP4 (panB6 fadE tsx acpS Δ (bio-gal)) (Polacco and Cronan, 1981) was transformed with plasmids pMR19 and pMS421 to yield strain DK554. Strain DV79 (metB1panD2 coaA16(fr) zij:Tn 10) (Vallari and Jackowski, 1988) was transformed with pMS421 and pMR19 to yield DK739. Strain SJ16 (metB1 relA1 spoT1 λ-λrgyrA216 panD2 zad-220::Tn 10 F-) (Jackowski and Rock, 1981) was transformed with two plasmids (pMS421 and pMR19) to give strain DK574. Strain MP3 was transformed with pHC122 to give strain DK757, or pHC122 and pMR24 to give strain DK758. Plasmid pHC122 encodes a mutant E. coli thioesterase I lacking the leader peptide under control of the arabinose promoter (Cho and Cronan, 1995). Plasmid pMR24 contains the wild type acpP gene expressed from the native promoter (Rawlings and Cronan, 1992). Plasmid pDK655 was constructed by ligating the acpP-containing EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pMR19 into pTZ19U (Mead et al., 1986) as described previously (Rawlings and Cronan, 1992). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (Kunkel, 1987). Single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was used as a template for synthesis using mixed mismatch-containing oligonucleotide TGGGTGCTGACA(G)CTCTGGACAC (Genetic Engineering Center University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) and the Muta-Gene site-directed mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). The resulting double-stranded transformants were sequenced by the double-stranded chain termination technique (Tabor and Richardson, 1987, 1989) using Sequenase 2.0 and double stranded plasmid DNA. Plasmids containing the expected mutation were then digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and the resulting acpP-containing fragments were ligated to EcoRI-HindIII-digested pKK223-3 to give plasmids pDK675 and pDK685. Culture media used were either rich broth (Davis et al., 1982) or minimal salts medium E (Davis et al., 1980) supplemented with 0.4% glucose and 0.1% vitamin-free casein hydrolysate (Difco). Spectinomycin (30 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (40 μg/ml), tetracycline (10 μg/ml), pantothenate (120 nM), or β-alanine (5 μM) were added as required. Solid media contained 1.5% agar. All cultures were grown at 37°C. Growth of liquid cultures were monitored with a Klett-Summerson colorimeter equipped with a green filter. Cells were grown in E media containing glucose and vitamin-free casein hydrolysate to early log phase (˜3 × 108 cells/ml). IPTG (1 mM) was then added, and at various time points Tran35S-label (ICN Biochemical, 50 μCi) was added to 1 ml of cell culture. The culture was allowed to shake for 10 min at 37°C, followed by addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid directly to the shaking culture, 2J. B. Ohlrogge, personal communication. and incubation on ice for 30 min. The trichloroacetic acid-treated culture was then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g, resuspended in 50 mM MES, 10 mMN-ethylmaleimide (pH 6.1) (Post-Beittenmiller et al., 1991) and either analyzed by urea-PAGE (see below) or quick-frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at −70°C. ACP species were analyzed as described previously (Post-Beittenmiller et al., 1991). Briefly, extracts were prepared as described above; urea was added to 2.5 M, followed by addition of sample buffer to a total volume of 50 μl. Samples were then fractionated on a 13% PAGE gel containing 2.5 M urea for approximately 2.5 h at 15°C. The gels were then fixed, dried and exposed to x-ray film. Apo-ACP standards were prepared by in vitro transcription/translation of pMR19 using the S30 in vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega). The extract plus plasmid DNA was assembled according to manufacturer's instructions and incubated for 1 h at 37°C, followed by addition of trichloroacetic acid to 2.5% and incubation on ice for 30 min. The precipitate was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g, resuspended in resuspension buffer (see above), quick-frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at −70°C. Labeling of wild type and mutant ACP with β-[3H]alanine was done as follows. Strains harboring plasmids which contained the wild type and mutant acpP genes were grown to early log phase in the presence of 10 μM β-[3-3H]alanine (92.6 Ci/mmol) followed by addition of 1 mM IPTG and growth for 6 h. The labeled cells were then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g, washed twice with resuspension buffer (see above). Trichloroacetic acid was added to 2.5% and the samples were incubated on ice for 10 min. The precipitates were then collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g and the resulting pellet washed three times with 1% trichloroacetic acid followed by scintillation counting. Labeling of fatty acids with acetate was done as described previously (Gelmann and Cronan, 1972). Briefly, strains were grown to early log phase in minimal E media, followed by addition of sodium [1-14C]acetate (5 μCi). The strain was then cultured for 10 min at 37°C and the labeling stopped by addition of 6 ml of 2:1 methanol:chloroform and unlabeled carrier cells. The lipids were then extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer(1959), transesterified to form methyl esters, and fractionated by argentation thin layer chromography (Morris et al., 1967). Determination of incorporation of acetate into free fatty acid pool in strains overproducing the leaderless tesA was accomplished by Bligh and Dyer extraction and fractionation on Silica Gel G as described previously (Jiang and Cronan, 1994). Labeling with [3H]palmitic acid followed an identical protocol except that labeling was done with 5 μCi of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid. G3P acyltransferase activity was assayed as described previously (Rock et al., 1981). Briefly, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12.5 μM acyl ACP, 5 mM MgCl2, 250 μM [1,3-14C]G3P (10,000 cpm/nmol), and 10 μg of E. coli membrane protein extract were incubated in the presence of varying amounts of purified apo-ACP (see below) for 10 min at 23°C followed by transfer to a Whatman No. 3MM disk. Disks were then washed with 20 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, followed by 15 ml of 1% trichloroacetic acid. The disks were then impaled on straight pins, dried under a stream of hot air, and counted in 2 ml of BCS scintillation fluid in a Beckman scintillation counter. Membranes were prepared as described previously (Rock et al., 1981) with the modification that the inner and outer membranes were not separated. Acyl-ACPs were prepared as described previously (Rock and Garwin, 1979) with the modification that acyl-ACP synthetase was purchased from Sigma. The assay was performed as described previously (Coleman, 1990) with the following modifications. Briefly, 32P-labeled 1-palmitoyl-G3P (1000 cpm) (see below), 20 μM acyl ACP, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 μg of membrane protein (Coleman, 1990) were incubated with varying amounts of apo-ACP. The reaction was started by addition of the membrane extract and incubation for 10 min and halted by the addition of 0.4 ml of 2:1 methanol:chloroform. The methanol:chloroform was then then removed under a stream of nitrogen, the pellet was dissolved in chloroform and spotted on a Silica Gel G plate, followed by development using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (25:15:4:2, by volume). The plate was then dried and exposed to a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager for quantitation. Labeled 1-acyl-G3P was prepared utilizing the ability of diglyceride kinase to phosphorylate monoacyl glycerides (Nachiappan and Rajasekharan, 1994). Briefly 1.4 mMrac-palmitoyl glycerol, 0.03 M MgCl2, 3.9 mM [32P]ATP, 29 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), and 0.1% Cutscum detergent was incubated with 0.1 units of diglyceride kinase (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 37°C. The labeled 1-palmitoyl-G3P was then isolated by utilizing the charged nature of 1-palmitoyl-G3P. The 1-palmitoyl-G3P was partitioned into the methanol phase of the Bligh and Dyer extraction. The methanol phase was then acidified by adding 48 mM ammonium acetate and chloroform. The chloroform phase was then separated from the methanol phase by centrifugation, followed by washing with KCl and water twice. The chloroform was then removed by a stream of nitrogen under heat, and the resulting pellet was brought up in methanol and 0.5 ml of water. The methanol was then evaporated in the presence of heat, and the resulting labeled 1-palmitoyl-G3P was stored at −20°C. This protocol yielded radiochemically pure 1-palmitoyl-G3P. Apo-ACP was purified as described previously (Rock and Cronan, 1980) with the following modifications. Strain DK554 was grown to 8 × 108 cells/ml. IPTG (1 mM) was added and the culture incubated for another 6 h. Cells were then centrifuged at 6000 × g and concentrated 100-fold in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), followed by two passages through a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i. DNase (55 units) and RNase (100 units) were added and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The pH of the cell lysate was increased to pH 8.5, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37°C. The cells were then diluted 10-fold in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and an equal volume of isopropanol was added followed by storage overnight at 4°C. The precipitate was centrifuged at 6,000 × g, the pH was titrated to pH 6.5, and DEAE-cellulose (DE-53, Whatman) (10 g) equilibrated to pH 6.1 was added and stirred overnight at 4°C. The DE-53 resin was then washed (in a Büchner funnel containing Whatman 1 paper) with Tris-HCl (pH 6.1) containing 0.25 M LiCl. The resin was poured into a column and the ACP eluted with 200 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.1) containing 0.5 M LiCl. The elutant fraction was then titrated with acetic acid to pH 3.9 and the ACP allowed to precipitate followed by centrifugation and dissolution of the pellet in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). Ammonium sulfate was added to 80%, followed by incubation on ice for 1 h. The precipitate was then removed by centrifugation at 6,000 × g and the ACP recovered by acid precipitation (as described above), followed by dialysis against 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) overnight. This procedure yielded essentially pure apo-ACP, as judged by gel electrophoresis. The physiological effects of overproduction of ACP were studied with a plasmid that placed a synthetic version of the acpP gene under control of the inducible tac promoter. Addition of IPTG to the growth media resulted in overexpression (˜20-fold) of ACP. The polypeptide produced by this synthetic gene has been shown by a number of analyses to be indistinguishable from that of the wild type acpP gene (Rawlings, 1993). The growth rate of an E. coli strain overexpressing ACP (Fig. 1) was followed by measurement of turbidity. Approximately 1 h after induction the growth rate began to decline and growth virtually ceased 3-4 h after induction. The decline in growth rate was accompanied by a marked loss of viability (˜500-fold) (Rawlings, 1993). Filamentation accompanied the loss of viability, but no cell lysis occurred. We have found that even 2-5-fold overexpression of ACP results in detectable accumulation of unmodified ACP and growth inhibition, although the degree of toxicity is proportional to the level of overexpression. ACP is one of the most abundant soluble proteins in E. coli and thus it seemed unlikely that higher concentrations of ACP should result in growth inhibition. Therefore we attempted to determine if ACP overproduction was accompanied by novel forms of E. coli ACP that might be the cause of the toxicity. We examined the composition of the ACP pool produced by E. coli during ACP overproduction. Cells labeled with [35S]methionine were subjected to electrophoresis on 13% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of urea (Fig. 2). In this gel system, the migration of an ACP depends on post-translational modification and subsequent acylation with long chain acyl ACPs migrating more rapidly than shorter chain length fatty acyl ACPs. Surprisingly, the predominant species seen at later time points was a species that comigrated with apo-ACP. Clearly, when ACP is overproduced from a multicopy plasmid, the cellular capacity for post-translational modification of ACP becomes rate-limiting. Because no detectable pool of apo-ACP exists in wild type cells (Jackowski and Rock, 1983), it seemed possible that accumulation of this form of ACP could be responsible for the toxic effects of overproduction. To more directly test the effects of apo-ACP on cell growth, we constructed mutants of ACP defective in post-translational modification. Serine 36 (the amino acid covalently linked to 4′-phosphopantetheine) was changed to either alanine or threonine by site-directed mutagenesis. The inability of the mutant ACPs to undergo efficient post-translational modification was demonstrated by measuring the relative incorporation of β-[3H]alanine into ACP. β-Alanine is a precursor of CoA and specifically labels the ACP prosthetic group. No detectable post-translational modification of the S36T protein was seen, whereas the S36A mutant protein seemed to inhibit modification of the chromosome-encoded wild type protein (Fig. 3B). The S36T mutant was chosen for further study because the structural similarity of threonine to serine resulted in no noticeable change in the structure of apo-ACP as judged by gel electrophoresis (the alanine-substituted ACP migrated aberrantly on these gels). Production of the S36T mutant protein was growth-inhibitory (Fig. 3A) consistent with the hypothesis that that the apo form of ACP is responsible for the growth arrest. If apo-ACP accumulation is toxic, a decrease in the level of apo-ACP relative to holo-ACP should give a corresponding decrease in lethality. Since CoA is the direct donor of 4′-phosphopantetheine to apo-ACP, an increase in the intracellular CoA concentration should give a greater level of modification of overexpressed ACP. Strain DK739 contains a mutant pantothenate kinase refractory to feedback inhibition by non-esterified CoA (Vallari and Jackowski, 1988). Pantothenate kinase has been shown to be the rate-limiting step for CoA biosynthesis (Jackowski and Rock, 1983), and the combination of the feedback-insensitive kinase with a second mutation that blocks synthesis of pantothenate allows manipulation of the CoA pool size by addition of varying amounts of pantothenate to the growth media. Overexpression of ACP was induced (Fig. 4A) in wild type and feedback-resistant pantothenate kinase strains grown in media containing either a high or a low concentration of pantothenate (the suggestion of Dr. C. O. Rock). Addition of a high concentration of pantothenate to the media resulted in a significant increase in the growth rate during ACP overproduction. However, even in the presence of large amounts of pantothenate the growth rate remained subnormal (Fig. 4A). We attribute the remaining growth inhibition to the lack of complete post-translational modification observed even in cells containing large intracellular CoA pools. The compositions of the ACP pools were examined during ACP overexpression in the presence of the different concentrations of pantothenate (Fig. 4B). The level of apo-ACP relative to holo-ACP (seen largely as ACP-ACP dimers formed by disulfide cross-linking during sample preparation) decreased approximately 6-fold when ACP was overproduced in the feedback-resistant strain grown with high pantothenate. It should also be noted that the strain containing the wild type pantothenate kinase showed a similar tendency toward reduced relative apo-ACP pool size when grown with high pantothenate, although the effect was less pronounced than in the feedback-resistant strain. Since the sole known essential function for ACP in E. coli is its role in lipid metabolism, it seemed likely that the effects of apo-ACP resulted from inhibition of some aspect of lipid metabolism. We, therefore, measured the rate of incorporation of labeled acetate (a precursor of all E. coli lipids) into lipids during ACP overexpression. Labeling carried out at various times following induction of the acpP gene showed a pronounced decrease (Fig. 5) in acetate incorporation into lipids. More striking was the differential inhibition of acetate incorporation into the three major fatty acid species found in E. coli phospholipids. The most drastic and immediate decrease was in cis-vaccenate observed within 40 min following acpP induction. It should be noted that the decrease in cis-vaccenate occurred before any change in growth rate. The inhibition of acetate incorporation into palmitoleate and saturated species (primarily palmitate) occurred in a more gradual fashion, although within 3 h after addition of IPTG there was virtually no incorporation of [14C]acetate into fatty acids in the ACP-overexpressing strains. The observed decrease in incorporation of labeled acetate into lipids (Fig. 5) could be due to inhibition of the synthesis of long chain fatty acyl ACPs or the transfer of fatty acyl-ACPs into phospholipid or both. To determine whether apo-ACP affects the synthesis or utilization of long chain acyl ACPs, we uncoupled fatty acid synthesis from phospholipid synthesis. Normally in E. coli, these two processes are tightly coupled and no detectable pool of long chain acyl ACPs exists, thus precluding direct measurement of the rate of fatty acid synthesis. To avoid this problem, we used of a system developed recently to uncouple fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis (Cho and Cronan, 1995), which utilizes a plasmid encoding a mutant cytosolic E. coli thioesterase I under control of the arabinose promoter. The mutant thioesterase cleaves long chain acyl-ACPs, resulting in accumulation of large amounts of free fatty acids, and allows direct measurement of the fatty acid biosynthetic rate. The rate of incorporation of labeled acetate into free fatty acids in strains containing the thioesterase plasmid (Fig. 6) did not decrease during low level (˜8-fold)2 ACP overproduction. In fact, the rate of synthesis was increased about 5-6-fold upon ACP overexpression. The free fatty acid pool produced under these conditions consisted primarily of full-length fatty acids, indicating that ACP overproduction failed to block fatty acid biosynthesis. These data indicate that the observed inhibition of lipid synthesis must be the result of inefficient utilization of the full-length fatty acids. Consistent with this hypothesis, induction of cytosolic thioesterase I in a strain that overproduced ACP at a low level (˜8-fold) resulted in a complete cessation of growth, whereas neither thioesterase production nor 8-fold ACP overproduction alone were lethal. Thus, it seemed that decreased utilization of acyl-ACP coupled with the hydrolysis of acyl-ACP results in complete growth inhibition. G3P acyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of long chain fatty acids from ACP (or CoA) to the 1-position of G3P. Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated in vitro inhibition of G3P acyltransferase activity by holo-ACP (Rock et al., 1981). Since this inhibition did not require a free sulfhydryl group (Rock et al., 1981), it seemed possible that apo-ACP might also inhibit G3P acyltransferase. Therefore, we examined the effect of purified apo-ACP on the activity of G3P acyltransferase in vitro. Apo-ACP was a strong inhibitor of G3P acyltransferase activity (Fig. 7A). However the degree of inhibition varied according to the type of fatty acid donor. Utilization of cis-vaccenoyl-ACP was inhibited to a much greater extent than was utilization of palmitoyl-ACP. Apo-ACP inhibition of the utilization of palmitoleoyl-ACP was not studied in detail due to the low activity of this substrate in the assay (Rock et al., 1981). The inhibition seen was competitive with respect to acyl-ACP implying that apo-ACP occupies the same active site as that used by acyl-ACP (data not shown). Apo-ACP is also a powerful inhibitor of G3P acyltransferase activity in vitro when acyl CoAs are used as substrates. The results obtained with acyl-CoAs as acyl donors were very similar to those seen using acyl-ACPs in that cis-vaccenoyl-CoA was inhibited to a greater extent than was palmitoyl-CoA. Apo-ACP inhibition of G3P acyltransferase activity was noncompetitive with respect to acyl-CoA consistent with the finding that acyl-CoA and acyl-ACP use different sites on the enzyme (Rock et al., 1981). The in vitro data correlated well with labeling data obtained in vivo, which showed that apo-ACP inhibited incorporation of fatty acids supplied either endogenously or exogenously (see below). The effect of apo-ACP upon the second step of phosphatidic acid synthesis, the 1-acyl-G3P acyltransferase reaction, was tested in vitro. Purified apo-ACP was also found to inhibit the ACP-dependent acylation of 1-acyl-G3P acyltransferase (Fig. 7B). However, this inhibition differed considerably from the effect on G3P acyltransferase activity in that the inhibition only occurred at much higher apo-ACP concentrations. Moreover, utilization of palmitoyl-ACP was inhibited to a greater extent than was utilization of unsaturated substrates. To determine if the inhibition of the G3P acyltransferases that was observed in vitro also occurred in vivo, incorporation of labeled fatty acid into phospholipids was measured under conditions that did not require de novo synthesis of the fatty acyl donors. Phospholipids were extracted from cells labeled with exogenous palmitate under conditions of ACP overexpression (Fig. 8). Overproduction of ACP resulted in a decrease in utilization of fatty acids. It should be noted that exogenous fatty acids are activated and utilized as CoA esters, suggesting that the inhibition seen in vivo occurs without regard for carrier molecule linked to the fatty acid. We have shown that the apo form of ACP is a potent inhibitor of lipid metabolism synthesis. It is unclear why apo-ACP is a more powerful inhibitor than holo-ACP. The folding of apo-ACP has been shown to be less stable than that of holo-ACP (Jackowski and Rock, 1983), but no interaction of the prosthetic group with holo-ACP residues other than the covalent bond to serine 36 has been detected by NMR (Holak et al., 1988). However, we have recently determined that a detectable pool of apo-ACP accumulates in cells with depleted CoA pools as a result of pantothenate starvation under certain growth conditions. 3D. H. Keating and J. E. Cronan, Jr., manuscript in preparation. The specificity of apo-ACP inhibition in regard to acyl donors and the limited number of effected enzymatic activities suggest that apo-ACP might act as a regulator of acyltransferase activity during pantothenate starvation. Because so little is known concerning the enzymes (holo-ACP synthase and ACP phosphodiesterase) that add and remove the prosthetic group, it seems possible that turnover of ACP is regulated by unknown factors and that the interconversion of the apo and holo forms of ACP could play an important regulatory role."

This compound has also been reported to reverse chloroquine resistance in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Martin, S. K., Oduola, A. M. J., and Milhous, W. K.(1987) Science 235, 899-901). Although the mechanism of this [Medline] reversal is unknown, it apparently involves an increase in the amount of chloroquine present in erythrocytes infected with the resistant parasites. Chloroquine is a diprotic weak base that accumulates in acidic organelles as a function of the pH gradient present between the organelle and the external medium. By changing the external medium pH, this property of chloroquine was used to alter the cytotoxicity phenotype of genetically chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant trophozoites. Verapamil was also found to be toxic for malaria trophozoites, although this toxicity was independent of external pH and consistently about 3-4-fold higher against resistant strains. When verapamil was tested for its effects on chloroquine cytotoxicity under conditions of phenotypic reversal, it was still found to exert only a measurable effect on the genetically resistant trophozoites. In short time incubations, verapamil was found to increase net chloroquine accumulation in erythrocytes infected with both chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant organisms, but only to affect the chloroquine susceptibility of the latter. Analysis of our data demonstrates that verapamil works independently of the overall pH gradient concentrating chloroquine into a trophozoite's lysosome. Instead, we propose that it inhibits the activity of a membrane ion channel indirectly responsible for determining chloroquine transit within the parasite's cytoplasm.

Human falciparum malaria (caused by an intracellular parasite of the genus Plasmodium) remains a serious disease in much of the tropical and subtropical world. There are at least 300 million new infections every year causing an estimated 2 million deaths mostly of young children. Due to its specificity, stability, and safety, chloroquine has been one of the most successful and widely used antimalarial drugs (reviewed in (2Slater A.F.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 57: 203-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar)). The biological activity of chloroquine is directed against the intraerythrocytic stage of Plasmodium infection. During this stage, Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites obtain much of their amino acid requirements by degrading erythrocyte hemoglobin within an acidic food vacuole, a specialized organelle with some resemblance to mammalian lysosomes(3Goldberg D.E.

Heme is released during this process and rendered into a nontoxic, crystalline polymer called hemozoin or malaria pigment (6Slater A.F.G. Swiggard W.J. Orton B.R. Flitter W.D. Goldberg D.E. Cerami A.

Nature. 1995; 374: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Accumulation of toxic amounts of heme substrate is probably then ultimately responsible for parasite cell death. The evolution and geographical spread of P. falciparum trophozoites resistant to chloroquine has greatly reduced the clinical effectiveness of this compound(2Slater A.F.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 57: 203-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 10White N.J. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 11Foote S.J. Cowman A.F. Acta Trop. 1994; 56: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Identification of the biochemical mechanism responsible for chloroquine resistance would therefore assist in the development of alternative chemotherapeutic strategies. The heme polymerizing activity contained in extracts of both chloroquine-resistant and -sensitive trophozoites has similar sensitivity to inhibition by chloroquine(2Slater A.F.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 57: 203-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), while a chemical modification of chloroquine by resistant organisms has never been demonstrated(12Gluzman I.Y. Schlesinger P.H. Krogstad D.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1987; 31: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 1Berger, B., Martiney, J. A., Slater, A. F. G., Fairlamb, A. H., and Cerami, A.(1995) J. Parasitol., in press. Therefore, the mechanism of resistance must involve either the differential sequestration and/or uptake and transport of chloroquine within the parasite. Many investigators have associated a reduced accumulation of chloroquine in infected erythrocytes with the acquisition of chloroquine resistance, suggesting that resistant trophozoites lower their lysosomal chloroquine concentration below that necessary to disrupt hemoglobin catabolism. Two mechanisms to account for this reduction in accumulation of chloroquine have been proposed. The weakened proton pump model postulates an increase in vacuolar pH leading to reduced weak base-driven accumulation of chloroquine (a diprotic weak base) into the lysosomes of resistant parasites(13Bray P.G. Howells R.E. Ward S.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Bray P.G. Ward S.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 113: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although plausible, the central predication of this model concerning changes in vacuolar pH have not been detected, and it remains controversial. Similarities to mammalian tumor cell multidrug resistance (MDR), 2The abbreviations used are: MDRtumor multidrug resistanceSCQchloroquine-sensitive D10 strainRCQchloroquine-resistant Dd2 strain. chiefly the reversal of chloroquine resistance by drugs such as verapamil (a Ca2+ channel blocker) and phenothiazines lead Martin et al.(1Martin S.K.

However, correlations between either mutation or overexpression of known malaria mdr genes and chloroquine resistance have not been detected in genetic selection experiments. tumor multidrug resistance chloroquine-sensitive D10 strain chloroquine-resistant Dd2 strain. The reversing effect of verapamil on chloroquine resistance has been confirmed in numerous studies; however, its biochemical target(s) and mechanism of action in malaria trophozoites are unknown. Bray et al.(15Bray P.G. Boulter M.K. Ritchie G.Y. Howells R.E. Ward S.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Bray P.G. Howells R.E. Ritchie G.Y. Ward S.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that verapamil increases chloroquine accumulation in resistant parasites. To further understand the biochemical mechanism behind this observation, we have used the weak base phenomena to phenotypically alter the chloroquine susceptibility of both genetically chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant trophozoites. Verapamil exerted no effect on the toxicity of chloroquine for sensitive trophozoites under any experimental conditions examined, while it continued to increase the chloroquine susceptibility of resistant organisms even when rendered phenotypically sensitive by weak base manipulation. Verapamil was also found to induce a saturable increase of net chloroquine accumulation into both chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant organisms, while its mechanism of reversing chloroquine resistance is shown to be separable from any direct toxic action. We conclude that verapamil specifically increases chloroquine accumulation in genetically resistant P. falciparum trophozoites independently of weak base processes and phenotypic susceptibility due to external pH manipulations. Cultures of P. falciparum were grown in A+ human erythrocyte suspensions using RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) medium supplemented by 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.35), 0.2% NaHCO3 (23 mM), 0.2% D-glucose, and 10% human A+ plasma and maintained at 37°C in candle jars according to the method of Trager and Jensen(17Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar, 18Jensen J.B. Trager W. J. Parasitol. 1977; 63: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Parasites were stage-synchronized by incubating mainly ring-stage infected erythrocytes in 5% sorbitol for 10 min at room temperature(19Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). Cultures were allowed to undergo one growth cycle (2 days) before use. Strains used were the chloroquine-sensitive strain D10 (SCQ) and the chloroquine-resistant isolate Dd2 (RCQ) (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Lanzer, Sloan Kettering). Parasite growth was monitored by measuring incorporation of hypoxanthine into the nucleic acids of the parasite as described previously(20Desjardins R.E. Canfield C.J. Haynes J.D. Chulay J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979; 16: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). Effects of chloroquine, verapamil, and external pH on parasite growth was determined by measuring the reduction in incorporation of radiolabel as compared to controls. Briefly, assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates, each well containing 200 μl of synchronized ring-stage infected erythrocytes in complete media and 50 μl of drug dilution or solvent. Media pH was manipulated by the addition of small aliquots of 1 N HCl or 1 N NaOH plus supplemented with 25 mM HEPES to maintain buffering capacity. The final hematocrit was 1.5%, and percent parasitemias ranged from 1-5%. After 24 h of candle jar incubation at 37°C, 2.5 μCi of [3H]hypoxanthine (17 Ci/mmol, Amersham) was added to each well. After 18 h, the wells were harvested onto glass fiber filters, dried, and placed in scintillation vials with 7 ml of scintillation fluid. Vials were counted in a liquid Beckman LS7800 scintillation counter. Chloroquine and verapamil IC50 values were calculated by extrapolation of the log dose-response curves. IC50 values represent the molar concentration which decreases [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation by 50% as compared to drug-free controls. Highly synchronized trophozoite-parasitized red blood cell cultures were washed and then incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented by 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.35), 0.2% NaHCO3, 0.2% D-glucose, 1% human plasma, and 4 nM [3-3H]chloroquine (26.4 Ci/mmol, Dupont NEN) at 37°C under continuous stirring and parasitemias of 1-10% and hematocrits of 1.5-4.0%. Aliquots were centrifuged through silicon oil (d = 1.050, Aldrich) at various times (0.5-60 min), separating the red blood cell pellet from unincorporated label, terminating chloroquine uptake. For rapid measurements, synchronized trophozoite-stage parasites or control uninfected erythrocytes were layered upon an oil cushion in Eppendorf tubes residing inside a centrifuge at 37°C. 4 nM radiolabeled chloroquine was added to each tube at 2-3-s intervals. Accumulation was stopped by centrifugation. The cell pellet, now separated from the culture medium by the oil layer, was then processed according to published methods (21Krogstad D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Herwaldt B.L. Schlesinger P.H. Wellems T.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with minor variations. The tube bottom tips containing the cell pellets were cut off and placed in scintillation vials containing 100 μl of ethanol and 50 μl of 0.5 N NCS-II tissue solubilizer (Amersham). After mixing of reagents, vials were incubated overnight at 37°C. The lysate was then decolorized by the addition of 25 μl of 30% H2O2. Luminescence was blocked by acidification with 25 μl of glacial acetic acid. Vials were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS7800) for 2 min. The amount of label remaining in the aqueous medium was measured throughout the experiment to monitor for depletion. Only time points in which less than 15% of label was depleted from the aqueous layer were used for data analysis. 1 μM verapamil was added to the media in some experiments and preincubated for 10-30 min prior to addition of labeled chloroquine. Uninfected red blood cells were subjected to identical preincubation protocols in verapamil before chloroquine uptake measurements. Data from different experiments was normalized for percent hematocrit, percent parasitemia, and total label added. Chloroquine (7-chloro-4-(4-diethylamino-1-methylbutylamino)quinoline) diphosphate, verapamil (5-[(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)methylamino]-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-isopropylvaleronitrile), and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Under standard conditions, the IC50 values for D10 and Dd2 parasite strains are 22 ± 5 and 131 ± 25 nM chloroquine, respectively; these two strains are henceforth designated as chloroquine-sensitive (SCQ) and -resistant (RCQ). Yayon et al.(22Yayon A. Cabantchik Z.I. Ginsburg H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2784-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) showed that raising external medium pH (pHo) increases chloroquine toxicity for FCR3TCP. falciparum trophozoites, as predicted by the weak base effect. We used this method to make SCQ trophozoites phenotypically resistant (for example, a chloroquine IC50 of 25 nM at pHo of 7.35 is increased to >50 nM at pHo below 6.60). Similar experiments with RCQ demonstrated that they become hyper-resistant at pHo below 7.0 (i.e. the efficiency of their resistance mechanism is enhanced at low pHo) but phenotypically sensitive above pHo 8.20 (chloroquine IC50 < 50 nM). The weak base effect can therefore be used to switch the chloroquine susceptibility of sensitive and resistant organisms. This phenotypic reversal is not due to interstrain differences in parasite growth. Measurements of growth at various pHo values revealed no difference between SCQ and RCQ parasites (data not shown). Martin et al.(1Martin S.K. Oduola A.M.J. Milhous W.K. Science. 1987; 235: 899-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) reported that nontoxic verapamil concentrations reverse chloroquine resistance and yet have no effect on chloroquine susceptibility of sensitive strains. By using pHo manipulations to reverse phenotype, we found that the verapamil reversal effect is specific for chloroquine-resistant genotype, but independent of actual chloroquine sensitivity. For RCQ parasites, 1 μM verapamil reduced chloroquine IC50 regardless of whether their phenotypic susceptibility was hyper-resistant (for example, 584 nM at pHo 6.55) or sensitive (for example, 29 nM at pHo 7.8; 15 nM at pHo 8.50) (Fig. 1). The verapamil-induced increase in RCQ chloroquine susceptibility is therefore independent of whether the parasites are phenotypically hyper-resistant, resistant, or susceptible to chloroquine. On the other hand, identical verapamil concentrations have no effect on genetically chloroquine-sensitive parasites, even under conditions in which they are phenotypically resistant. For example, at pHo 6.35, the SCQ strain has an IC50 of 210 nM independent of the presence of verapamil (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the decrease in RCQ chloroquine IC50 by verapamil is remarkably similar at all pHo values, regardless of actual IC50. 1 μM verapamil reduced RCQ chloroquine IC50 an average of 73 ± 6% across all pHo tested. On the other hand, verapamil had no effect on SCQ chloroquine IC50 (average change of −4 ± 9%). These data demonstrate that the reversal of chloroquine resistance by verapamil is specific for parasite genotype and not phenotype. When directly tested for cytotoxicity, verapamil has been shown to have weak intrinsic antimalarial properties(1Martin S.K. Oduola A.M.J. Milhous W.K. Science. 1987; 235: 899-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The two strains used in this study differ in their sensitivity to verapamil, RCQ parasites being more susceptible to verapamil toxicity than SCQ parasites under normal growth conditions (Fig. 2). There was little variation in verapamil IC50 within each strain throughout the pHo range of 6.4 to 7.9 (7.2 ± 2.1 μM for RCQ and 2.5 ± 0.7 μM for SCQ), suggesting that verapamil does not act as a lysosomal weak base. The average fold difference in verapamil toxicity between strains was 3.2. These findings raise the following questions. 1) Is reversal of chloroquine resistance an indirect consequence of differential verapamil toxicity (as concentrations of verapamil used in these and other published studies are primarily within toxic ranges for Dd2 parasites? (2Slater A.F.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 57: 203-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) Can the chloroquine IC50 of sensitive parasites be lowered in the presence of more verapamil? To address these issues we measured chloroquine IC50 in the presence of increasing verapamil concentrations (Fig. 3). RCQ chloroquine IC50 decreases with increasing verapamil concentrations until it plateaus at 10 nM in the presence of 5 μM verapamil. Although verapamil toxicity continues to increase, suppressing parasite growth by 90% at 15 μM, no further changes in chloroquine IC50 are detected. The chloroquine-sensitive D10 parasites, on the other hand, undergo no changes in chloroquine IC50 as a function of verapamil concentration, even at highly toxic verapamil concentrations (20-30 μM). Therefore, the chloroquine resistance reversing property and direct toxic actions of verapamil are not related. Furthermore, reversal of chloroquine resistance is not an indirect outcome of further stressing a “verapamil-weakened” parasite, as toxic concentrations of verapamil do not alter chloroquine sensitivity in the SCQ strain. Krogstad et al.(23Krogstad D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Kyle D.E. Oduola A. Martin S.K. Milhous W.K. Schlesinger P.H. Science. 1987; 238: 1283-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and Bray et al.(15Bray P.G. Boulter M.K. Ritchie G.Y. Howells R.E. Ward S.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Bray P.G. Howells R.E. Ritchie G.Y. Ward S.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) demonstrated that verapamil increases chloroquine accumulation in resistant parasites providing a possible mechanistic explanation of its reversal activity. We examined the effects of verapamil on chloroquine accumulation under our experimental conditions. As expected, RCQ parasites accumulate less chloroquine than SCQ trophozoites (Fig. 4A). 1 μM verapamil increased chloroquine accumulation into RCQ parasites about 2-fold (Fig. 4B). This increase was similar at all pHo tested (an average of 2.2 ± 0.5-fold after 15 min, data not shown). There was no change in background chloroquine accumulation into uninfected erythrocytes in the presence of verapamil (data not shown). Interestingly, chloroquine accumulation seems to slightly increase in D10 parasites in the presence of 1 μM verapamil. Therefore, we measured chloroquine accumulation into trophozoites in the presence of increasing verapamil concentrations (Fig. 5). Chloroquine accumulation increases rapidly in Dd2 trophozoites as verapamil concentration is increased up to 2 μM, after which only minor fluctuations in uptake are observed. This verapamil dose-response curve correlates with the IC50 data illustrated in Fig. 3, in which chloroquine sensitivity decreases rapidly up to 2 μM, and then saturates. We were able to measure chloroquine accumulation into resistant parasites at normally toxic verapamil concentrations because this assay lasts for only 10-30 min. In SCQ trophozoites, a similar range of verapamil concentrations results in a significant rise in chloroquine accumulation between 0.5 and 1 μM verapamil before saturating (Fig. 5). The total increase in chloroquine accumulation is similar to that observed in RCQ parasites (about a 2-fold increase from baseline levels). This result is significant in that it is not accompanied by any changes in chloroquine sensitivity (see Fig. 3). We conclude that verapamil affects a saturable mechanism regulating the net accumulation of chloroquine in both parasite strains, but that sensitivity to chloroquine is altered only in genetically resistant parasites.Figure 5:Chloroquine accumulation rates as a function of verapamil concentration. Chloroquine accumulation rates over a 10-min period for SCQ (filled squares) and RCQ (filled circles). The lines represent the nonlinear least squares fit to the data. Each data point represents mean ± S.D. of at least two different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, chloroquine accumulation does not correlate perfectly with chloroquine sensitivity. At pHo 7.35, RCQ parasites are 4-5-fold less sensitive to the toxic effects of chloroquine but accumulate only about 2-3-fold less drug. Manipulation of the weak base effect by alteration of pHo results in chloroquine accumulation variations. Even under conditions in which resistant parasites accumulate more chloroquine than sensitive trophozoites (Fig. 6), chloroquine sensitivity is still markedly higher in SCQ trophozoites (chloroquine IC50 of 35 ± 5 at pHo 6.7 versus RCQ IC50 of 90 ± 10 at pHo of 7.6). We performed detailed kinetic studies on the initial rate of chloroquine uptake by infected erythrocytes (0-2 min). Addition of radiolabeled chloroquine to infected and uninfected red blood cells results in an instantaneous (<2 s) uptake of label, probably the initial partitioning of chloroquine across membranes. Infected erythrocytes continue to accumulate label and by 10-15 s there is a clear difference between infected and uninfected red blood cell. By 45-60 s, there is a clear difference in chloroquine accumulation between resistant and sensitive parasites (Fig. 7). However, the increased chloroquine accumulation observed in verapamil-treated Dd2 trophozoites (versus untreated Dd2) takes >5 min to develop (Fig. 4B). Therefore, verapamil does not affect chloroquine accumulation during the first 60 s of uptake, the time period during the accumulation phase that differences between SCQ and RCQ are first evident. Chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant P. falciparum trophozoites develop apparently identically within human erythrocytes and produce similar amounts of hemozoin pigment. As chloroquine resistance does not appear to involve a change either in the process of hemoglobin proteolysis, heme polymerization, or drug metabolism, resistance can only be achieved by lowering the effective concentration of chloroquine within the trophozoite's food vacuole(2Slater A.F.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 57: 203-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Chloroquine and related antimalarial quinolines are hydrophobic weak bases known to concentrate within low pH vacuoles(24De Duve C. De Barsy T. Poole B. Trouet A. Tulkens P. Van Hoof F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 2495-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). For example, Ginsburg and Geary (25Ginsburg H. Geary T.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1567-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) estimate that at nanomolar external concentrations (pH 7.2) diprotic chloroquine can reach millimolar levels within a trophozoite lysosome (estimated pH in the range 4.8-5.2). Three different mechanisms by which chloroquine-resistant trophozoites could reduce the amount of chloroquine that accumulates in this organelle can be envisaged. 1) Reducing the magnitude of the weak base effect by raising lysosomal pH, 2) rapid efflux of chloroquine from the parasite cytoplasm or lysosome, 3) trapping a charged form of chloroquine in the cytoplasm such that the rate of entry into the lysosome is slowed. We and others have shown that the toxicity of chloroquine for both chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant trophozoites is dependent on pHo, as predicted by the weak base theory of drug uptake. Assuming that the vacuolar pH of chloroquine-sensitive trophozoites is about 4.8, then changing the pH gradient from 3 (pHo = 7.8) to 2 (pHo = 6.8) results in a 4-fold increase in chloroquine IC50. Under physiological conditions (pHo = 7.35), chloroquine-resistant trophozoites typically display a 5-10-fold decrease in their chloroquine sensitivity. To account for this by a direct change in the pH gradient from external medium to lysosome would clearly require a vacuolar pH in excess of 6.0. However, attempts to directly measure even a small difference in lysosomal pH between chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant trophozoites have so far been unsuccessful(21Krogstad D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Herwaldt B.L. Schlesinger P.H. Wellems T.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The results of Goldberg et al.(3Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F.G. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 4Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F.G. Beavis R. Chait B. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) also indicate that the rate of lysosomal hemoglobin degradation would be markedly slower if vacuolar pH values were above 6.0, again inconsistent with the equal rates of hemozoin formation observed in chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant trophozoites. Evidence for the existence of a rapid efflux mechanism for the selective expulsion of chloroquine from erythrocytes infected with chloroquine-resistant but not chloroquine-sensitive trophozoites has been presented, although the finding is controversial (summarized in (2Slater A.F.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 57: 203-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and (11Foote S.J. Cowman A.F. Acta Trop. 1994; 56: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)). Using the D10 and Dd2 strains of chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum, we have only been able to detect a small and inconsistent difference in the rate of chloroquine efflux between the two strains. For example, after loading trophozoites for 45-60 min at pHo 7.35 with 4 nM chloroquine, average drug efflux after 10 min was 32 ± 14% from SCQ trophozoites (n = 6) and 43 ± 3% from RCQ trophozoites (n = 4). 3J. A. Martiney, unpublished data. This agrees with the results of Bray and colleagues (13Bray P.G. Howells R.E. Ward S.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Bray P.G. Ward S.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 113: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bray P.G. Boulter M.K. Ritchie G.Y. Howells R.E. Ward S.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Bray P.G. Howells R.E. Ritchie G.Y. Ward S.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that chloroquine resistance correlates with net chloroquine uptake rather than rapid drug efflux from infected erythrocytes. Furthermore, our observation that 2 μM verapamil increases net chloroquine uptake about 2-fold in both SCQ and RCQ trophozoites also argues against the importance of a verapamil-inhibitable chloroquine efflux mechanism specific for chloroquine-resistant trophozoites. By manipulating pHo, we have found that the chloroquine cytotoxicity phenotype of genetically chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant trophozoites can be reversed. Verapamil lowered the chloroquine IC50 of RCQ trophozoites about 75% irrespective of whether the trophozoites were forced to be phenotypically sensitive (pHo > 7.8) or hyper-resistant (pHo > 6.8). In marked contrast, the chloroquine susceptibility of SCQ trophozoites was completely refractory to coincubation with verapamil, even when they were made phenotypically resistant by lowering pHo below 6.5. Therefore, the verapamil-inhibitable mechanism of chloroquine resistance is specific for genetically chloroquine-resistant parasites and does not simply result from a change in the pH gradient from external medium to lysosome. In RCQ trophozoites exposed to verapamil, the decrease observed in chloroquine IC50 only depends on verapamil concentration and not on the rate of chloroquine accumulation. A likely explanation for this observation is that a given amount of verapamil inhibits a constant fraction of the activity of some undefined protein. If verapamil acted to reduce vacuolar pH (thereby increasing the rate of chloroquine accumulation by directly raising the magnitude of the pH gradient between external medium and lysosome), it would be expected to proportionately exert a more pronounced effect on chloroquine cytotoxicity when the pH gradient was small. However, this is clearly not consistent with our data. It is much more likely that the protein target for verapamil modulates chloroquine accumulation and intracellular partitioning independent of vacuolar pH, and that the reversing agent blocks the activity of the same fraction of this putative protein irrespective of the pH gradient present. Consistent with this proposal, in the presence of 1 μM verapamil, the chloroquine IC50 of RCQ trophozoites responds to changes in pHo in a similar way to SCQ parasites cultured without the drug (Fig. 1). We conclude that the overall weak base pH gradient driving chloroquine concentration from the external medium into the lysosome of a trophozoite is not the site for verapamil reversal of chloroquine resistance. Given the greater sensitivity of chloroquine-resistant trophozoites to the direct toxic effects of verapamil, it has been proposed that the synergism observed between chloroquine and verapamil is due to a nonspecific “weakening” of the resistant parasite by the later compound, indirectly making them more sensitive to chloroquine. However, ultrastructural studies have shown that the early morphological changes characteristic of chloroquine toxicity in a sensitive strain of P. falciparum are also apparent in resistant trophozoites upon simultaneous exposure to verapamil and chloroquine, arguing against two different mechanisms for cell killing (26Jacobs G.H. Oduola A.M.J. Kyle D.E. Milhous W.K. Martin S.K. Aikawa M. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1988; 39: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our data confirm this by demonstrating that verapamil-weakened SCQ trophozoite remain completely refractory to any changes in their susceptibility to chloroquine. The direct toxic effects of verapamil therefore appear to be unrelated to its reversal properties. However, it would be interesting to test whether other chloroquine resistance reversal agents, such as desipramine and cymetidine, also demonstrate differential toxicity between strains. The site and molecular identity of the verapamil-sensitive target in chloroquine-resistant trophozoites is unknown. One way in which a trophozoite could exploit the weak base effect to become chloroquine-resistant is to reduce the pH of its cytoplasm, analogous to an experimental reduction in external pH. This would increase the fraction of protonated chloroquine molecules present and thereby reduce the rate of further passage of the unprotonated form into the lysosome. For example, a reduction of cytoplasmic pH by 0.1 unit would decrease uncharged chloroquine by 22%; a further 0.1 change would result in 37% less uncharged chloroquine available for entry into the vacuole. Several published reports have documented cytoplasmic pH (pHi) alterations in mammalian tumor MDR cell lines. For example, the steady state efflux of the weak base doxorubicin has been shown to strongly correlate with pHi(27Roepe P.D.

Possible mechanisms of pHi alteration include modifications in Cl-, H+, or HCO3- transport and other indirect changes in membrane potential and/or cell volume. Overexpression of murine MDR1 in CHO fibroblasts results in an inhibition of Cl- and HCO3--dependent pHi homeostasis concomitant with the drug resistance phenotype (28Luz J.G. Wei L.Y. Basu S. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7239-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Roepe P.D. Wei L.Y. Cruz J. Carlson D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11042-11056Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A Cl- ion conductance associated with the MDR protein has been observed(30Valverde M.A. Diaz M. Sepulveda F.V.

Anderie I. Schulz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24410-24417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane movement of Cl- ions is an important component in the regulation of pHi, volume, and membrane potential in mammalian cells, and it has recently been proposed that tumor multidrug resistance mediated by P-glycoprotein occurs secondary to perturbations in these parameters(33Roepe P.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 445-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Verapamil could thus act by “correcting” an anomalous Cl- conductance. Indeed, evidence that verapamil reverses the altered Cl--dependent pHi behavior of MDR-transfected mammalian cell lines has been presented(34Roepe P.D. Weisburg J.H. Luz J.G. Hoffman M.M. Wei L.-Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7239-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transmembrane transporters such as the multidrug resistance (MDR) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) proteins have been associated with increased Cl- channel activity. This channel regulator function is separate from any putative transport activities(35Valverde M.A. Hardy S.P. Sepulveda F.V. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesize that the mutation conferring chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum up-regulates a Cl- channel regulator protein, which alters ion conductances that indirectly control drug transit within the parasite's cytoplasm by setting the cytoplasmic pH. It is this chloride channel regulator which is inhibited by verapamil during reversal of resistance. Interestingly, we have recently found that changes in the ionic composition of the external medium, as well as the presence of specific blockers of several known pH and volume regulators, alters chloroquine uptake into erythrocytes infected with chloroquine-resistant trophozoites. 4J. A. Martiney, A. Cerami, and A. F. G. Slater, manuscript in preparation. Resolution of the role of ion channels in drug transport is critical both to the further understanding of chloroquine resistance and to the ultimate goal of pharmacological intervention intended to overcome this problem We thank Gary Latortue and Angel Ferrer for technical help, and Barbara Sherry, Kevin Tracey, and Kirk Manogue for helpful discussions."

Class I molecules consist of a polymorphic integral membrane glycoprotein (α chain) complexed to β2-microglobulin, a soluble nonglycosylated protein. Both chains possess NH2-terminal hydrophobic sequences that target them co-translationally to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Most antigenic peptides, having no such ER insertion sequence, remain sequestered on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane and require a specific transporter, termed TAP (acronymic for transporter associated with antigen processing) to access class I molecules. TAP is produced by the association of two MHC-encoded subunits, termed TAP1 and TAP2(4Deverson E. Gow I.R. Coadwell W.J. Monaco J.J. Butcher G.W. Howard J.C.

The TAP genes are members of a large family of integral membrane transporters referred to as ATP binding cassette (ABC) proteins since each has a characteristic sequence associated with ATP binding. ATP hydrolysis is believed to drive the transport of the wide variety of substrates handled by the various family members(9Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). Typically, ABC transporters are comprised of a single subunit containing two cytosolic ATP binding domains of approximately 300 residues and 12 hydrophobic domains believed to traverse the membrane, with short peptides connecting the hydrophobic domains. The structure of TAP is similar to other ABC proteins, with the most notable difference being its division into two polypeptides, TAP1 and TAP2, each containing a single ATP binding domain and 6 potential transmembrane domains. The past 2 years have witnessed rapid progress in understanding TAP-mediated translocation of peptides. Using semi-intact and cell-free systems, the basic requirements for peptide length and sequence have been defined(10Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hämmerling G.J.

There are still sizable gaps, however, in our knowledge of numerous aspects of TAP, including its assembly, intracellular trafficking, and precise mechanism of function. In the present study we explore some of these issues using recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVVs) expressing each TAP subunit or the two subunits simultaneously. The antigen processing-deficient human cell lines T2 (24Salter R.D. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and B6 (25Arnold D. Driscoll J. Androlewicz M.

L929 mouse fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 7.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. rVVs were propagated in thymidine kinase-deficient human 143B osteosarcoma cells. rVVs expressing TAP1 (VV-TAP1) or TAP2 (VV-TAP2) were produced by cloning cDNAs encoding the respective genes behind the early/late VV p7.5 promoter into a modified pSC11 plasmid as described(26Chakrabarti S. Brechling K. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3403-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The human TAP1 (a allotype) and TAP2 (b allotype) genes have been described(27Bahram S. Arnold D.

A double rVV expressing TAP1 and TAP2 genes under the control of the p7.5 promoter (VV-TAP[1+2]) was produced by the method described by Coupar et al.(1988)(28Coupar B.E.H. Andrew M.E. Boyle D.B.

Briefly, the TAP2 gene fragment ending with XhoI sites was inserted into the SalI site of pTK-7.5B plasmid, which contains the herpes simplex virus type I thymidine kinase gene under the control of the VV promoter P-F. 143B cells infected with TAP1-rVV were transfected by the pTK-7.5B plasmid containing the TAP2 insert. Double rVVs with the TAP1 gene inserted in the VV tk gene and the TAP2 gene in the VV HindIII-F region were selected for thymidine kinase expression by inclusion of aminopterin in the growth medium(29Boyle D.B.

T2 cells were infected for 15 h with rVVs and incubated for 15 min at 0°C with fluorescein-conjugated antibodies specific for HLA class I molecules (W6/32; Accurate, Westbury, NY), β2-microglobulin (The Binding Site, San Diego, CA), or mouse ICAM-1 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). After washing once, cells were resuspended in PBS supplemented with 10 μg/ml ethidium homodimer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed using a FACSCAN (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Nonviable cells fluorescently labeled with ethidium homodimer were excluded from analysis. Target cells were infected with VV as described(31Eisenlohr L.C. Bacik I. Bennink J.R. Bernstein K.

Data are expressed as percentage of specific release defined as ((experimental cpm - spontaneous cpm)/(total cpm - spontaneous cpm)) × 100. VV-infected L929 cells were prepared for immunofluorescence as described(33Yewdell J.W. Yellen A. Bächi T. Cell. 1988; 52: 843-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Double antibody immunofluorescence was performed by incubating coverslips for 2 h at 20°C with PBS containing 1 μg/ml of rabbit anti-TAP1 antibody. After washing with PBS, coverslips were incubated for 2 h at 20°C with PBS containing 1% (v/v) Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, washed and incubated for 2 h at 20°C with PBS containing 33% (v/v) rat hybridoma tissue culture supernatant containing a mAb specific for immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP)(34Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearny J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Coverslips were then washed, incubated for a further 2 h at 20°C with PBS containing 1% (v/v) fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG, washed, and mounted in Fluorsave (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Images of fluorescent staining were acquired using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal microscope, and hard copies were produced as described (35Lapham C.K. Bacik I. Yewdell J.W. Kane K.P. Bennink J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Detergent extracts were prepared as described below, with the exception that the extraction buffer was supplemented with 5 mM Ca2+ and 5 mM Mn2+. Extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with agarose coupled to concanavalin A (ConA, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and immunoreactive species remaining in the supernatant were collected as described below. For metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.), L929 cells were infected as described(36Russ G. Bennink J.R. Bachi T. Yewdell J.W. Cell Reg. 1991; 2: 549-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Four hours post-infection, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in serum-free, methionine-free DMEM and then, after adjusting cells to a concentration of 1-2 × 108/ml, for 5-15 min at 37°C in 1 ml of the same medium supplemented with 400 μCi of [35S]methionine. Cells were then pelleted and chased at 37°C in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml methionine. For labeling with [2-3H]mannose (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), 1-2 × 108/ml cells were incubated in serum-free, glucose-free medium for 15 min at 37°C in 1 ml of the same medium supplemented with 1 mCi of [2-3H]mannose. For all radiolabeling experiments, cells were shifted to 0°C after appropriate incubation periods until detergent-extracted by 15 min of incubation at 0°C in × 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% MEGA9, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4. Following centrifugation at 15,000 × g, supernatants were harvested and precleared by overnight incubation with protein A-agarose preloaded with rabbit serum specific for an irrelevant antigen. Supernatants were then incubated for 1 h with protein A-agarose preloaded with the affinity-purified rabbit anti-peptide antiserum RING4 produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal 15 residues of TAP1(5Trowsdale J. Hanson I. Mockridge I. Beck S. Townsend A. Kelly A. Nature. 1990; 348: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, proteins were eluted from beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the conditions of Laemmli(37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Digestion of samples with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) was performed as described(36Russ G. Bennink J.R. Bachi T. Yewdell J.W. Cell Reg. 1991; 2: 549-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After acid fixing and staining with Coomassie Blue to ensure that equivalent amounts of antibody were recovered from samples, gels were dried at 80°C under vacuum. For samples labeled with [2-3H]mannose, gels were incubated with Amplify® (Amersham) prior to drying. Fluorographs of tritiated samples were produced by exposing dried gels to preflashed film at −70°C. Dried gels containing [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), which were imaged and quantitated using the associated hardware and software. Fluorographs were digitized using a flatbed scanner and quantitated using the PhosphorImager software. Hard copies of digital images were produced using Adobe Photoshop software and a Kodak XL7700 printer. Six- to eight-week-old BALB/cByJ (H-2d) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were immunized with 106 plaque forming units of VV by intravenous injection. VV-infected cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and detergent extracted as described above with 1% Triton X-114 (Pierce) replacing Nonidet P40 and MEGA9. Following centrifugation at 15,000 × g, supernatants were harvested, incubated on ice (total in Fig. 7) or underlaid with cushion solution (6% sucrose in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.06% Triton X-114), and incubated at 37°C for 5 min, at which time clouding was obvious (38Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following centrifugation at 15,000 × g at room temperature the aqueous phase and detergent phase (yellow droplet at the bottom of the tube) were removed separately and diluted 5 times with normal extraction buffer, and species reactive with anti-TAP1 antiserum were collected as described above. Photolabeling was performed according to Hobson et al.(39Hobson A.C. Weatherwax R. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7333-7337Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 3.5 h post-infection, cells were incubated for 30 min in serum-free, glucose-free medium containing 1 mM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone to deplete ATP. Extracts were prepared by incubating cells for 15 min at 0°C in 250 mM sucrose, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, 10 mM Tris, pH 6.8 and centrifuging at 15,000 × g for 30 min. 100-μl aliquots of the supernatant were placed in the wells of a 96-well flat bottom microtiter plate, and 2 μl of 8-azido-[α-32P]-ATP were added (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). Samples were irradiated for two 2.5-min intervals, first at 245 nm (1250 microwatts/cm2) and then at 365 nm (1050 microwatts/cm2), with a 1-min interval to prevent excessive heating. Approximately 3 × 106 cells were used for each labeling reaction. For competition experiments, the same conditions were used, but samples were preincubated on ice with various nucleotides. Samples were diluted to 1 ml with the extraction buffer used for radioimmuno-collection, and the reactive species were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. The function of rVV-produced TAP1 and TAP2 was examined by testing the ability of rVVs to rescue the ability of T2 cells (which express neither TAP subunit) to present VV antigens to mouse H-2Kd-restricted, VV-specific TCD8+. To enable TCD8+ recognition, cells were co-infected with a rVV expressing Kdα chains. As previously reported(31Eisenlohr L.C. Bacik I. Bennink J.R. Bernstein K. Yewdell J.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 40Yewdell J.W. Lapham C.K. Bacik I. Spies T. Bennink J.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1163-1170PubMed Google Scholar), presentation of Kd-restricted VV antigens by T2 cells is minimal (Fig. 1A). Co-infection of cells with VV-TAP[1+2] greatly increased lysis, despite the fact that co-infection with an additional rVV would be expected to decrease the rate of Kd biosynthesis. Target cell lysis was Kd-restricted since cells infected by VV-TAP[1+2] alone were not lysed. Co-infection of VV-Kd-infected cells with either VV-TAP1 or VV-TAP2 alone failed to restore antigen presentation. Triple infection of cells with all three recombinants, however, enabled TCD8+ recognition. The decreased restoration relative to double infection with Kd and VV-TAP[1+2] can be attributed to both competition for gene expression between rVVs and the decreased likelihood of triple infection versus double infection. Notably, co-infection of VV-Kd infected cells with either VV-TAP1 or VV-TAP2 alone failed to rescue antigen presentation. This indicates that neither subunit alone is able to rescue antigen presentation. In additional experiments using antigen processing-deficient cells lacking one of the two subunits, infection with the appropriate rVV expressing a single TAP subunit was able to restore presentation of either VV antigens or a number of foreign antigens to the appropriate TCD8+ population (data not shown). The number of class I-peptide complexes necessary for lysis by TCD8+ in the cytotoxicity assay employed in this study is not known but is possibly under 1000 complexes/cell(41Kageyama S. Tsomides T.J. Sykulev Y. Eisen H.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 567-576PubMed Google Scholar). To more quantitatively test the ability of rVVs expressing TAP subunits to restore class I assembly, T2 cells were infected overnight with rVVs at 37°C, and the cell surface expression of native endogenous class I molecules was determined by flow cytometry. T2 cells cultured at 37°C express considerable amounts of HLA-A2 due to its association with peptides derived from ER insertion sequences(42Wei M.L. Cresswell P.

Spies T. Nature. 1992; 360: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the level of endogenous class I expression detected by fluorescein-conjugated W6/32 (a mAb specific for native class I molecules), or fluorescein-conjugated sheep anti-β2-microglobulin antibodies was roughly doubled by infection with VV-TAP[1+2]. In contrast, infection with rVVs expressing the individual subunits did not significantly increase class I expression. The specificity of enhanced class I expression is shown by the failure of TAP[1+2] expression to enhance the surface expression of VV-encoded mouse ICAM-1, a non-MHC-associated integral membrane glycoprotein. These findings demonstrate that VV-expressed TAP1 and TAP2 are functional, but only when expressed together. This is concordant with findings in microsomal or permeabilized cell systems that both subunits are required for peptide transport into the ER above background levels (10Neefjes J.J. Momburg F.

To biochemically characterize TAP, affinity-purified rabbit antibodies raised to a peptide corresponding to the 15 COOH-terminal residues of TAP1 were used to recover TAP1 from detergent extracts. Following 15 min of labeling with [35S]methionine of cells infected for 4 h with VV-TAP1, we detected a protein with a Mr of 69,000 in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). This is less than the predicted Mr of 75,000 but in accord with previously reported values(44Kelly A. Powis S.H. Kerr L.-A. Mockridge I. Elliott T. Bastin J. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A.

Nature. 1992; 355: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The mobility of TAP1 was unchanged over a 2-h chase period (see Fig. 5B). The absence of this protein from cells infected with a control VV confirms its identity as TAP1 (not shown). Following infection with VV-TAP[1+2], or co-infection with VV-TAP1 and VV-TAP2 a new band with the expected mobility of TAP2 (Mr 74,000) appeared (Fig. 2A). To determine whether assembly of TAP occurred in detergent extracts, cells infected with VV-TAP1 or VV-TAP2 were mixed and detergent-extracted, and the species reactive with anti-TAP1 antibody were collected (Fig. 2B). This resulted in the recovery of TAP1 only. Similarly, TAP(1+2) heterodimers were not detected when detergent extracts from cells infected with either VV-TAP1 or VV-TAP2 were mixed. Adding radiolabeled TAP2 in a 5-fold excess over TAP1 still did not result in detectable complex formation. Based on these findings, we conclude that under the conditions employed for detergent extraction, all TAP heterodimers detected are formed in cells.Figure 5:[2-3H]mannose labeling TAP1. A, L929 cells were labeled for 30 min with [2-3H]mannose 3.5 h post-infection with VV-TAP1 or VV-HA and incubated at 0°C (P) or 37°C (C) for 3 h.

TAP1 or Kd was collected from detergent extracts, digested with endo H (+) or mock-digested, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Following double infection of cells with VV-TAP1 and VV-TAP2, TAP1 was always recovered in higher amounts using the anti-TAP1 antiserum. Even if assembly occurred with 100% efficiency this would be expected, since it is statistically inevitable that some cells will be infected with a greater number of VV-TAP1 virions (and vice versa). Following infection with VV-TAP[1+2], enhanced recovery of TAP1 relative to TAP2 was observed in approximately half of the experiments. Since we expect that TAP1 and TAP2 are translated at the same rate in VV-TAP[1+2]-infected cells, this implies that a pool of unassembled TAP1 (and possibly TAP2) exists. In the other experiments, however, using the identical stock of VV-TAP[1+2], the ratio of TAP1 to TAP2 was close to 1, indicating that TAP assembly can be quite efficient, even when unnaturally overexpressed in the absence of up-regulation of other gene products normally regulated in parallel with TAP. The variability in the ratio of TAP1:TAP2 recovered might reflect true variability, the efficiency of TAP assembly in vivo, or artefactual variability in the preservation of the heterodimers in biochemical procedures following detergent extraction. The former possibility would be consistent with TAP assembly being a regulated process. We next examined the rate of assembly of TAP heterodimers by labeling VV-TAP[1+2]-infected L929 cells for 1 min with [35S]methionine and chasing cells for 5 or 15 min (Fig. 2C). The amount of TAP1 recovered increased 3.4-fold within 5 min of initiating the chase. Since protein synthesis in mammalian cells occurs at a rate of approximately 10 residues/s, synthesis of TAP is likely to require between 1 and 2 min. This probably accounts for most of the increase in TAP1 recovery over the chase period, although we cannot rule out the occurrence of intrinsic alterations in TAP structure or the association of TAP1 with molecular chaperones that limits antibody access to the COOH terminus. Most notably, there was little increase in the ratio of TAP1:TAP2 recovered in either of the chase periods relative to the pulse. This indicates that complex formation occurs extremely rapidly. These findings were confirmed using the antigen-deficient human cell line B6, which expresses only the TAP1 subunit. Following infection with VV-TAP2, complex formation was again detected within 5 min (not shown). TAP assembly is remarkable in that it occurs as swiftly as any oligomeric membrane proteins we are aware of(46Doms R.W. Lamb R.A. Rose J.K. Helenius A.

https://openalex.org/W2093353836,"Pinealocytes, endocrine cells that synthesize and secrete melatonin, possess a large number of synaptic-like microvesicles (MVs) containing the L-glutamate transporter (Moriyama, Y., and Yamamoto, A.(1995) FEBS Lett., 367, 233-236). In this study, the L-glutamate transporter in MVs isolated from bovine pineal glands was characterized as to its driving force, requirement of anions, and substrate specificity. Upon the addition of ATP, the MVs accumulated L-glutamate. The uptake was significantly dependent on the extravesicular Cl- concentration, being negligible in the absence of Cl- and maximum at 2-5 mM and decreasing gradually at 20-100 mM. The membrane potential (inside positive) was maximum at 0-10 mM Cl- and then decreased gradually depending on the Cl- concentration, whereas a pH gradient was practically absent without Cl- and increased gradually up to 100 mM Cl-. Ammonium acetate or nigericin plus K+, a dissipator of a pH gradient, had little effect on or was slightly stimulatory toward the uptake, whereas valinomycin plus K+ inhibited both formation of the membrane potential and the glutamate uptake to similar extents. The ATP- and Cl--dependent glutamate uptake was inhibited by fluoride, iodide, or thiocyanate, without vacuolar H+-ATPase being affected. An anion channel blocker, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, similarly inhibited the glutamate uptake in a Cl- protectable manner. Furthermore, ATP- and glutamate-dependent acidification of MVs was observed when 4 mM Cl- was present. Among more than 50 kinds of glutamate analogues tested, only a few compounds, including 1-aminocyclohexane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, caused similar acidification. A good correlation was observed between the acidification and the inhibition of glutamate uptake by glutamate analogues. These results indicated that 1) the major driving force of the glutamate uptake is the membrane potential, 2) Cl- regulates the glutamate uptake, probably via anion-binding site(s) on the transporter, and 3) the transporter shows strict substrate specificity. Hence, the overall properties of the vesicular glutamate transporter in the MVs well matched those of the synaptic vesicle glutamate transporter. We concluded that the vesicular glutamate transporter, being similar if not identical to the neuronal counterpart, operates in endocrine cells.

We concluded that the vesicular glutamate transporter, being similar if not identical to the neuronal counterpart, operates in endocrine cells. Pinealocytes are parenchymal endocrine cells of pineal glands that synthesize and secrete melatonin into the blood(1Axelrod J.

At least two kinds of secretory vesicle-like organelles have been identified in pinealocytes: dense core granules, which are speculated to be involved in the storage and secretion of melatonin and some neuropeptides such as arginine vasotocin(3Malvin P.V.

Bargsten G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although histochemical evidence indicated that MVs are distinct from neuronal synaptic vesicles in their lack of synapsin I, the possible participation of MVs in some secretory pathways in pinealocytes was also speculated(5Redecker P. Bargsten G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). synaptic-like microvesicle 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid transmembrane pH gradient transmembrane potential difference vacuolar H+-ATPase 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid bis(3-phenyl-5-oxoisoxasol-4-yl)peptamethine oxonol. Very recently, we established a procedure for isolating MVs from bovine pineal glands and found that these vesicles were actually devoid of synapsin I but possess synaptotagmin and synaptobrevin 2, proteins necessary for vesicular transport(6Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the MVs specifically accumulated L-glutamate in an energy-dependent manner(6Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results suggested that MVs are the organelles in pinealocytes that store and secrete L-glutamate. Therefore, it seems likely that pinealocytes possess novel glutamate-evoked signal transducing systems. To reveal the entire features of the putative MV-mediated signal transduction systems in pinealocytes, at first we focused on the glutamate transporter in MVs. So far, the ATP-dependent vesicular glutamate transporter has been identified in brain synaptic vesicles(7Naito S. Ueda T. J. Biol.

Because the glutamate transporter in pineal MVs is the first example of a vesicular glutamate transporter outside neuronal cells, it is of interest to determine the mechanistic difference or similarity between glutamate transporters of the neuronal and endocrine origins. In this study, we characterized the glutamate transporter in pineal MVs and obtained evidence that it is quite similar to that in brain synaptic vesicles. The details are given in (6Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, bovine pineal glands (about 50 glands for one preparation) obtained from a local slaughterhouse within a few hours after killing were washed, cut into small pieces with scissors, suspended in 80 ml of SME buffer (20 mM MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0) containing 0.3 M sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), and then homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g (Rmax) for 10 min, and then the resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 11,000 × g (Rmax) for 20 min. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 40 min. The resultant pellet was washed once, suspended in 2.5 ml of SME buffer (crude MV fraction), and then applied to a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (0.7 ml of 1.8, 1.2, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, and 0.4 M sucrose containing 5 μg/ml pepstatin A and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation at 207,700 × g (Rmax) for 3 h, four distinct bands were obtained. The top broad white band was collected, diluted 5-fold with SME buffer, and then centrifuged at 139,000 × g for 40 min. The pellet (purified MVs) was suspended in SME buffer and stored at −85°C until use. More than 95% of the vesicles in the final preparation were MVs (relatively clear small vesicles with an average diameter of 50 nm containing synaptophysin and V-ATPase), as revealed on conventional and immunoelectron microscopy using an anti-synaptophysin monoclonal antibody(6Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The MVs were distinct from synaptic vesicles in their lack of synapsin I(6Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, the uptake of radioactive L-glutamate by MVs was assayed in 0.5 ml of 20 mM MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0) containing 4 mM KCl, 0.3 M sucrose, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM ATP (Tris salt, pH 7.0), and MVs (about 50 μg of protein) (standard assay conditions). The assay was started at 30°C by the addition of radioactive glutamate (2.5 μCi, 0.1 mM). Aliquots (100 μl) were taken at intervals and filtered through 0.45 mM Millipore filters (type HA). Ater extensive washing, the remaining radioactivity on the filters was counted with a liquid scintillation counter. The formation of ΔpH (inside acidic) was measured by means of acridine orange fluorescence quenching as described previously, the excitation and emission wavelength pair being 492 nm and 540 nm, respectively(11Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Δψ (inside positive) was measured by means of oxonol-V fluorescence quenching (excitation, 580 nm; emission, 620 nm) (11Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). L-[2,3-3H]Glutamate (638.3 GBq/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp. The glutamate analogues listed in 3, 4 were from Tocris Neuramin, except for methyleneglutamate, γ-ethylglutamate, methylglutamate, aspartate, and γ-aminobutyrate, which were from Sigma. ATP (Tris salt) was from Sigma. DIDS was obtained from Dojindo Laboratories (Japan). Other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available.3 Open table in a new tab 4 Open table in a new tab MVs purified from bovine pineal glands took up L-glutamate, which was coupled with an electrochemical proton gradient established by V-ATPase(6Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). During the assaying glutamate uptake by pineal MVs, we noticed that a low concentration of Cl- significantly enhanced the L-glutamate uptake, as shown in Fig. 1A. Cation species were not responsible for the activation (data not shown). The Cl- concentration required for the maximum glutamate uptake was 2-5 mM, with the uptake decreasing gradually at higher concentrations (Fig. 1B). Only 6% of the maximum activity was observed in the absence of Cl- (Fig. 1B). Chloride and bromide anions were equally effective for the activation (Fig. 1C). The nitrate, iodide, and gluconate ions were slightly effective, whereas the acetate and bicarbonate ions were not effective, and the fluoride and thiocyanate ions were inhibitory (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that the ATP-dependent glutamate uptake by pineal MVs is anion-sensitive and requires Cl-. The requirement of a low concentration of Cl- may be one of the significant properties of the glutamate uptake. The following alternative mechanisms may possibly explain the activation: one is direct interaction of Cl- with the glutamate transporter and another is the necessity of Cl- for the formation of an electrochemical proton gradient, because V-ATPase is an anion-sensitive proton pump(14Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9175-9180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

To clarify the role of Cl- in the glutamate uptake, we next analyzed the effects of anions on ATP-dependent membrane energization. Fig. 2 shows the Cl--dependence of ATP-dependent formation of ΔpH (inside acidic) and Δψ (inside positive) in MVs, as measured with fluorescent indicators. A proton conductor, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzylidene malononitrile (SF6847) (0.5 μM), or a V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (50 nM), inhibited the formation of both ΔpH and Δψ, confirming that V-ATPase formed an electrochemical proton gradient across the MV membrane (Fig. 2 A and B). The formation of ΔpH was dependent on the exogenous Cl- concentration; a little ΔpH was generated in the absence of Cl-, but it increased linearly up to 20 mM and then gradually to 100 mM Cl- (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, Δψ was highest at 0-10 mM Cl- and then decreased gradually depending on the Cl- concentration (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that the formation of Δψ prevented the formation of ΔpH electrically in the absence of Cl-, and that the collapse of Δψ due to Cl- uptake, possibly through an anion channel or anion transporter, induced further acidification, as in the case of other endomembrane systems(16Van Dyke R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2603-2611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nelson N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 553-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by the observation that Br-, another substrate of the endomembrane anion channel (transporter)(19Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18870-18873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also induced the ATP-dependent acidification, whereas other anions, such as sulfate or acetate, which are not substrates for the anion channel, did not (Fig. 2A). The dose-dependent effects of Cl- on the formation of ΔpH and Δψ differed from those of the glutamate uptake (Fig. 1C), indicating clearly that ΔpH and Δψ are not simply linked to the Cl--activated glutamate uptake. Two alternative possibilities as to the role of Cl- can be considered. One is that Δψ is the driving force and Cl- acts as a co-factor or a coupling anion for the uptake. The other possibility is that Δψ is a major driving force but that the small ΔpH present at a low concentration of Cl- is also necessary for the uptake. Then, we compared the effects of ionophores and the ammonium ion on the glutamate uptake, ΔpH and Δψ (Table 1). To control the magnitude of ΔpH and Δψ due to ionophores, 0.1 M potassium acetate was included in the assay medium as a K+ source, because this salt did not affect the Cl--stimulated glutamate uptake. Nigericin or ammonium acetate dissipated ΔpH without affecting or slightly increasing Δψ. Under these conditions, glutamate uptake was not affected or slightly stimulated. Valinomycin, on the other hand, partially abolished Δψ and inhibited glutamate uptake to similar extents. The combination of valinomycin and nigericin or ammonium acetate dissipated both ΔpH and Δψ, resulting in almost complete inhibition of the glutamate uptake. These results indicated that the magnitude of glutamate uptake into MVs is correlated with the magnitude of Δψ but not that of ΔpH. Thus, Δψ seems to be the driving force for glutamate uptake in pineal MVs, although we could not completely rule out the participation of a small ΔpH in the glutamate transport.1 Open table in a new tab The stimulatory effect of Cl-, therefore, suggests the presence of a Cl--binding site in the glutamate transporter. To reveal the properties of this putative Cl--binding site, we investigated the effects of various anions on the Cl--stimulated glutamate uptake. As shown in Fig. 3A, the fluoride, iodide, thiocyanate, and nitrate ions were all inhibitory, whereas other anions had little effect. The inhibitory effect of the nitrate ion was due to a decrease in the magnitude of the driving force (loss of Δψ) due to inhibitin of V-ATPase (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the fluoride and thiocyanate ions under the concentrations used in this experiment had little effect on Δψ (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the inhibition was due to direct interaction with the glutamate transporter. The iodide ion had a similar effect (not shown). The inhibition was reversible, and full activity was recovered after washing of the membranes (not shown). To find compounds that interact with the anion-binding site(s) irreversibly or that are more potent than thiocyanate, we tested several kinds of anion channel blockers. DIDS was found to be a strong inhibitor of the glutamate uptake (Table 2). DIDS also inhibited V-ATPase(19Xie X.-S. Crider B.P. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18870-18873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the ID50 value being 3.8 μM. However, the ID50 value on inhibition of the glutamate uptake was only 0.3 μM. Furthermore, inhibition of the glutamate uptake by DIDS was prevented by Cl- but not by acetate (Table 2). Taken together, these results suggested that the Cl--binding site(s) in the glutamate transporter can be occupied by F-, thiocyanate, or DIDS. The chloride-binding site(s) may be important for regulation of the uptake activity.2 Open table in a new tab It is difficult to elucidate the substrate specificity of the glutamate transporter, because only a limited number of radioactive glutamate analogues is available commercially. Even in the case of the synaptic vesicle glutamate transporter, the substrate specificity was evaluated indirectly by measuring the spectrum of inhibition of glutamate uptake in the presence of glutamate analogues(7Naito S. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 696-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Winter H.C. Ueda T. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As in the case of the brain synaptic vesicle glutamate transporter(9Maycox P.R. Deckwerth T. Hell J.W. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cidon S. Sihra T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8281-8288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we noticed that the combined addition of glutamate and ATP caused acidification in MVs when 4 mM Cl- was present in the assay medium (Fig. 4). The acidification was sensitive to bafilomycin A1 (50 nM). Furthermore, the rate of acidification became saturated depending on the glutamate concentration, the apparent Km value being 3 mM, which is comparable with the Km value (1.3 mM) obtained using the radioisotopes(6Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Some glutamate analogues, such as 1-aminocyclohexane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, showed similar ATP and Cl--dependent acidification (Fig. 4d). These results indicated that the Cl- and glutamate-dependent acidification reflected glutamate uptake by MVs; the uptake of the glutamate anion through the glutamate transporter dissipated Δψ, which in turn accelerated the formation of ΔpH. Therefore, we can estimate the kinetic parameters for the uptake of glutamate analogues by measuring the rate of analogue-evoked acidification. Table 3 shows the degree of acidification and the Km values obtained on glutamate analogue-induced acidification as described above. Aspartate, a substrate for the Na+-dependent glutamate transporter in plasma membranes(23Kanner B.I. Sharon I. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3949-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), was not effective. Again, cyclic glutamate analogues were relatively good substrates, with higher affinity than glutamate. The cis forms of these cyclic compounds were all ineffective. Four other compounds (D-glutamate, α-methyl-D,L-glutamate, γ-methylene-D,L-glutamate, and D,L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid) caused low acidification, suggesting that these compounds act as less efficient substrates. Inhibition of glutamate uptake by the same compounds was also examined (Table 4). Consistent with the acidification, cyclic glutamate analogues (trans form) strongly inhibited the glutamate uptake. Compounds causing acidification always inhibited glutamate uptake with a similar order of effectiveness. Other compounds, including sulfur-containing amino acids, which inhibited glutamate uptake in synaptic vesicles(22Winter H.C. Ueda T. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Dunlop J. Fear A. Griffiths R. Neuroreport. 1991; 2: 377-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), neither affected the uptake nor caused acidification (Table 3). At more than 5 mM, these sulfur-containing amino acids partially inhibited the glutamate uptake, but the inhibition was due to the decreased driving force upon inhibition of V-ATPase (data not shown). The following glutamate analogues also neither affected glutamate uptake nor caused acidification: L-glutamate amide, D,Lα-hydroxyglutaric acid, 2,4-dinitrophenyl-L-glutamate, N-phthaloyl-D,Lglutamic acid, N-carboxymethylglutamic acid, N-acetyl-L-glutamic acid, N-phenacetyl-D,Lglutamic acid, N-methylpyro-D,Lglutamic acid, N-isopropylpyro-D,Lglutamic acid, ethyl-D,scap]l2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate, N-trimethyl-D,Lγ-glutamate, butyl-D,Lpyroglutamate, N-dimethyl-D,Lhydroxyglutamate, N-caproyl glutamate, β-oxyglutamate, β-hydroxyglutamate, N-benzyloxycarbamorylglutamate, N-toluenesulfonyl-L-glutamate, and S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine. 1-Amino-trans-3-phosphocyclopropane carboxylic acid inhibited about 40% of the glutamate uptake without acidification (Table 3), suggesting that this compound may bind to the transporter but not be transported. Taken together, these results suggested that the glutamate transporter in pineal MVs shows strict substrate recognition; a compound on the replacement of an amino group and a change in the carbon chain length of the L-glutamate moiety ceased to be a substrate. The transporter prefers a partially folded conformation of a substrate rather than an extended one. It seems likely that the transporter recognizes the configuration of the 1,3-carboxylates and 1-amino groups of cyclic glutamate analogues but is indifferent as to the length of the carbon chain on the opposite side of the cyclic molecules. Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, is stored in synaptic vesicles, is extruded into the synaptic cleft upon stimulation, and binds to its receptors present in postsynaptic membranes so as to transmit signals intercellularly(25Fonnum F. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar, 26Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1987; 28: 197-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). The vesicular glutamate transporter in synaptic vesicles is responsible for the storage of glutamate in neurons(27Ueda T. Robert P.J. Storm-Mathisen J. Branford H.F. Excitatory Amino Acids.

The chloride anion is suggested to regulate the transport activity via anion-binding site(s)(21Hartinger J. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23122-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the properties of this transporter at the molecular level remain obscure because neither purification of the transporter nor cloning of its cDNA have been successful. One of the aims of this study was to find a new approach for this fascinating transporter, because a comparative study will be possible if the vesicular glutamate transporter in pineal MVs resembles the synaptic vesicle counterpart. As summarized, the glutamate transporter in pineal MVs is driven by Δψ (positive inside) (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The spectrum of the requirement of anions for the uptake activity was essentially the same as that of the synaptic vesicle counterpart(7Naito S. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 696-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation by Cl- or Br- could be attributed to their direct interaction with the transporter, presumably via an anion-binding site (Fig. 3 and Table 2). At present, it is difficult to prove that Cl- acts as a counter ion for chloride and glutamate co-transport, because we can not demonstrate Cl- movement through either the glutamate transporter or the Cl- channel in MVs. Furthermore, we showed that the substrate specificity of the vesicular glutamate transporter was quite similar to that of the synaptic vesicle counterpart, as judged from the inhibition of glutamate uptake by glutamate analogues(7Naito S. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 696-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Winter H.C. Ueda T. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The overall properties of the glutamate transporters in synaptic vesicles and pineal MVs are similar to each other. We concluded that a glutamate transporter that is similar, if not identical, to the synaptic vesicle counterpart operates in MVs. Thus, pineal MVs constitute another experimental system for studies on the vesicular glutamate transporter. Pineal MVs contain synaptobrevin and synaptotagmin, proteins important for vesicular transport(6Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that pinealocytes express relatively high concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, Ca2+-channel protein, and smg25A (a small GTP-binding protein). Some of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein and smg25A was found to be associated with MVs. 2Moriyama, Y., Yamamoto, A., Tagaya, M., Tashiro, Y., and Michibata, H.(1995) Neuroreport6, in press. These results further support that MVs are the organelles that store L-glutamate and are involved in the glutamate-evoked signal transduction system. Released glutamate may bind to the glutamate receptor identified in pinealocytes (33Ebadi M. Govitrapong P. Murrin L.C. Reiter R.J. Karasek M. Advance in Pineal Research. John Libbey & Co., Ltd., New York1986: 99-109Google Scholar, 34Kus L. Handa R.J. McNulty J.A. J. Pineal Res. 1993; 14: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and may inhibit noradrenaline-stimulated N-acetyltransferase and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activities, resulting in inhibition of melatonin synthesis (35Govitrapong P. Ebadi M. Neurochem. Int. 1988; 13: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36van Wyk E. Daya S. Med. Sci. Res. 1994; 22: 635-636Google Scholar, 37Kus L. Handa R.J. McNulty J.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2241-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, we should point out the similarity between pinealocytes and retinal photoreceptor cells. Pinealocytes accumulate glutamate inside MVs and may extrude it through exocytosis, possibly at process terminals and/or the synaptic ribbon region ((6Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and this paper). Similarly, retinal photoreceptor cells use glutamate as a transmitter possibly via synaptic vesicle-mediated exocytosis at the ribbon synapse (38Oksche A. O'Brien P.J. Klein D.C. Pineal and Retinal Relationships. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 1-14Google Scholar, 39DeVies S.H. Baylor D.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 139-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Both types of cells lack of synapsins, suggesting that pineal MVs and retinal synsaptic vesicles move to their release sites though a novel mechanism(40Mandell J.W. Townes-Anderson E. Czernik A.J. Cameron R. Greengard P. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 19-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pinealocytes, especially from lower vertebrates, can receive photosignals via photo-receptive molecules such as pinopsin(41Okano T. Yoshizawa T. Fukada Y.

INTRODUCTIONDouble-stranded (ds) 1The abbreviations used are: dsDNAdouble-stranded DNAssDNAsingle-stranded DNASAstreptavidinntnucleotide. DNA must be melted to provide single strands (ss) for processes such as replication, recombination, and repair. The helicase enzymes responsible for providing ssDNA (Matson and Kaiser-Rogers, 1990; Lohman, 1993) apparently utilize energy available from nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis to disrupt the molecular interactions which stabilize dsDNA. However, the mechanism(s) by which the helicases transduce chemical energy to mechanical work necessary for dsDNA melting has not been established. Helicase binding to ssDNA, or in some cases dsDNA, stimulates their nucleotide triphosphatase activity, which in turn may drive protein conformational changes required for function (Wong and Lohman, 1992; Chao and Lohman, 1990; Geiselmann et al., 1993).The mechanism of dsDNA unwinding by the helicase may be related to its mechanism of translocation on ssDNA. Helicases have been categorized by their unwinding directionality, namely whether they unwind in a 5′ to 3′ or 3′ to 5′ fashion, relative to the strand on which they bind. This directional preference observed for dsDNA unwinding implies that helicases may translocate unidirectionally on ssDNA. Although translocation by the enzyme along ssDNA has been shown for a number of helicases, unidirectional translocation on ssDNA has generally not been demonstrated (Young et al., 1994b).Lohman (Wong and Lohman, 1992) has proposed a rolling mechanism for the Escherichia coli Rep helicase mode of action. This enzyme functions as a dimer in which each monomer provides a DNA binding site. Binding of one monomer to ssDNA frees the second to bind and unwind dsDNA at a ss/dsDNA junction. The proposed mechanism for E. coli Rep helicase does not necessarily require unidirectional translocation on ssDNA but relies on the polarity of the ss/dsDNA junction to provide directionality in dsDNA unwinding. von Hippel and co-workers (Geiselmann et al., 1993) have proposed a model for E. coli Rho helicase in which the enzyme translocates with a 5′ to 3′ directional bias and “unzips” an RNA/DNA hybrid. This mechanism does imply unidirectional translocation by the enzyme on ssRNA. Finally, it is possible that a helicase might unwind dsDNA without translocating via a “stoichiometric” mechanism. In this case, helicase binding near a ss/dsDNA junction induces formation of a region of ssDNA distal from the helicase binding site, to which a second molecule of the helicase may bind. The ss/dsDNA junction may thus be propagated unidirectionally without actual helicase translocation.The bacteriophage helicase Dda (DNA-dependent ATPase) has been implicated in early events in T4 DNA replication, although its precise role has yet to be determined (Barry and Alberts, 1994; Gauss et al., 1994). Dda has also been shown to stimulate the rate of DNA branch migration catalyzed by the T4 UvsX protein, a recombinase similar in function to E. coli Rec A protein (Kodadek and Alberts, 1987). Dda helicase unwinds DNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction in a distributive fashion (Jongeneel et al., 1984) with scant evidence for its translocation on DNA. In this report, the ATPase activity of Dda on different DNA strands has been used as a means to probe the possible translocation of the enzyme along ssDNA. We have constructed DNA strands of varying length as well as DNA strands containing potential blocks to translocation in order to investigate whether this enzyme translocates on ssDNA and, if so, whether translocation is directionally biased.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA, Oligonucleotides, and ReagentsOligonucleotide substrates were synthesized by Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA) and purified by preparative gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides containing biotin labels were prepared as described (Kaboord and Benkovic, 1993) and kindly provided by B. F. Kaboord. Poly(dT), poly(dA) and oligonucleotide dT16 were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Poly(dT) and oligo(dT)16 concentrations were measured at 260 nm with an extinction coefficient of 8520 M-1 cm-1 (Ts'o et al., 1966). For poly(dA), the extinction coefficient was 8600 M-1 cm-1 at 257 nm (Chamberlin, 1965). Purified oligonucleotides were quantitated by UV absorbance at 260 nm in 0.2 M NaOH using calculated extinction coefficients. Phosphoenolpyruvate (tricyclohexylammonium salt), ATP (disodium salt), NADH, and streptavidin were from Sigma. Phosphoenolpyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase were obtained as a crystalline suspension from Sigma.ProteinsThe Dda helicase was purified following the published procedure (Hacker and Alberts, 1992) with one exception; the DNase I treatment during cell lysis was eliminated. Dda concentration was determined by UV absorbance in 6 M urea using the extinction coefficient calculated from the amino acid sequence (∈280 = 59,060 M-1 cm-1). T4 32 protein was generously provided by B. F. Kaboord.ATPase AssaysDda ATPase activity was monitored spectrophotometrically with the assay described by Panuska and Goldthwait(1980). Except where indicated, all assays were performed at 25°C in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-OAc, pH 7.5, 10 mM KOAc, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 2.5 mM ATP, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 units/ml phosphoenolpyruvate kinase, 29 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 4 mM phosphenolpyruvate, 0.9 mM NADH, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The concentration of Dda for each experiment is indicated in the figure legends as is the concentration of DNA. No difference in steady-state ATPase activity was observed when experiments were initiated by addition of DNA or Dda. The final volume for each reaction mixture was 1 ml. ATP hydrolysis rates were followed by measuring the conversion of NADH to NAD+ at 380 nm with an extinction coefficient of 1210 M-1 cm-1. The oxidation of 1 mol of NADH corresponds to the hydrolysis of 1 mol of ATP.DNA Unwinding AssaysUnwinding experiments were carried out using a native polyacrylamide gel assay (Venkatesan et al., 1982: Matson and Kaiser-Rogers, 1990). The leading strand of the substrate was labeled with 32P and annealed to the appropriate complementary strand to create the desired substrate. Unreacted [γ-32P]ATP was removed by passing the labeled DNA through two Sephadex G-25 spin columns. The labeled DNA was then added to a stock solution of unlabeled substrate. DNA was added to the helicase assay buffer and unwinding was initiated by adding Dda. The final concentration of reagents in the unwinding reactions was 25 mM Tris-OAc, pH 7.4, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 10 mM KOAc, and 3 mM ATP in a final volume of 20 μl. DNA and Dda concentrations are shown in the figure legends. Reactions were stopped after 10 s by adding 20 μl of quench solution containing 0.5 M EDTA and a 30-mer oligonucleotide identical in sequence to the duplex region of the labeled strand of the substrate. The latter served as a trap to prevent labeled product from reannealing with its complementary strand. Final concentration of the 30-mer trapping strand was 20 times higher than the concentration of the substrate. Nondenaturing load buffer (5 μl, 50% glycerol, v/v) was added to 10 μl of each quenched reaction mixture, and samples were electrophoresed on a native 15% polyacrylamide gel. Gel images were obtained and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The amount of unwinding was determined by comparing relative amounts of ssDNA and dsDNA with corrections for trap efficiency and ssDNA in control samples.Fluorescence TitrationsThe intrinsic fluorescence of Dda helicase is quenched upon binding to DNA. Titrations of Dda with DNA were carried out using an SLM Aminco spectrofluorometer at 25°C in 25 mM Tris-OAc, pH 7.4, 150 mM KOAc, and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Correction for dilution during the titration was accomplished by titrating a sample containing only tryptophan in parallel with the Dda titration. The excitation wavelength for Dda was 281 nm and the emission wavelength 341 nm.RESULTSDda Helicase Unwinding Activity Exhibits 5′ to 3′ PolarityUnwinding experiments were carried out to extend previous observations which indicated that Dda unwinds dsDNA with a 5′ to 3′ polarity with respect to the strand to which Dda is bound (Jongeneel et al., 1984). The purified oligonucleotides were annealed to construct the four different substrates used for unwinding studies (Fig. 1). DNA unwinding was carried out using a gel assay in which the ssDNA product was trapped after quenching the reaction by adding an excess of an unlabeled strand which prevents reannealing of product (Raney et al., 1994). The ssDNA was separated from dsDNA on a native polyacrylamide gel with the relative quantities of ssDNA and dsDNA determined by quantitation of the radioactivity in each band using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The results are shown in Table 1.1 Open table in a new tab The 60-mer fork and 5′ tail substrates were unwound to a similar degree under these conditions. However, the 3′ tail and 30-mer duplex substrates were not measurably denatured during the 10-s reaction time. Thus, Dda unwinds DNA with a 5′ to 3′ polarity as previously shown but does not unwind a blunt end duplex oligonucleotide. The fact that the unwinding is directional suggests that the helicase may translocate in a 5′ to 3′ direction on ssDNA. This presumption is not necessarily valid (Young et al., 1994b). Translocation on ssDNA might not be directionally biased, if unwinding is unidirectional only as a consequence of the ss/dsDNA junction inducing the directionality (Lohman, 1993). Since Dda unwinds dsDNA in a distributive fashion, rapidly dissociating from DNA during the progress of the reaction, this helicase may not translocate at all (Raney et al., 1994; Jongeneel et al., 1984; Krell et al., 1979). Direct evidence for Dda translocation on ssDNA is required.Dda Binding to Poly(dA) Measured by ATPase Activity and Fluorescence QuenchingDda binding to poly(dA) was investigated by two methods. The stimulation of its ATPase activity as a function of increasing poly(dA) concentration gave rise to a saturation curve (Fig. 2A). The Kact determined for poly(dA) under these conditions is 31 ± 1.8 μM nt. From the intrinsic fluorescence quenching which occurs upon binding of Dda to poly(dA) (Fig. 2B), a Kd of 8.0 ± 1.0 μM nt poly(dA) was obtained. The difference in poly(dA) concentration required for Dda saturation in these two experiments indicates a possible difference in DNA binding by the enzyme in the presence of ATP hydrolysis. The difference is small and more compelling evidence was sought for translocation by measuring ATPase activity on DNA substrates of varying length and/or containing potential blocks to translocation.Figure 2:Binding of Dda helicase with poly(dA). Binding of Dda to poly(dA) was investigated by fluorescence quenching and by ATPase activity. A, ATPase activity was measured as a function of poly(dA) using the coupled ATPase assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” Dda concentration was 50 nM, and KOAc concentration was 160 mM. The Kact of 31 ± 1.8 μM nt was obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. B, fluorescence titration of Dda (150 nM) with poly(dA) in 25 mM Tris-OAc, pH 7.5, 160 mM KOAc at 25°C. The data were fit to the quadratic equation, yielding a Kd of 8 ± 1.0 μM nt.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A simple kinetic model (Fig. S1) describing steady-state ATPase activity for ATP-driven translocases has been proposed (Young et al., 1994a). The translocation process is represented by kt, which is the rate constant for dissociation of the enzyme from the end of the DNA lattice via translocation and is dependent on DNA length. All enzyme-DNA species which are capable of hydrolyzing ATP are combined into one term, E•DNA, which hydrolyzes ATP with the rate constant k. The terms describing Vmax (, e is the total enzyme concentration) and Kact (the Kact for DNA,) for this simple model predict that increasing DNA length should result in decreased values of Kact while not changing Vmax. This model provides a useful context in which to analyze DNA dependent ATPase activity. Vmax=ek(Eq. 1) Kact=kt+k-1k1(Eq. 2) Figure S1:Scheme I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ATPase Activity on Varying Length OligonucleotidesSeveral groups have shown a length dependence for the DNA stimulation of helicase ATPase activity (Young et al., 1994b; Matson and George, 1987; Liu and Alberts, 1981). A translocating helicase is expected to show differential stimulation of ATPase activity as a function of DNA length due to the helicase advancing to the ends of shorter DNA fragments more quickly than longer ones. No DNA length dependence has been shown for Dda ATPase stimulation, since ATPase activity seen with a 10-mer oligonucleotide was the same as with longer polynucleotides (Jongeneel et al., 1984; Krell et al., 1979). In our hands, oligonucleotides of different lengths likewise showed only small differences in their stimulation of Dda ATPase activity (Figure 3:, 2). The shortest oligonucleotide, 13-mer, was the most effective; the longest oligonucleotide, 50-mer, was the least stimulatory, suggesting that the helicase was sensitive to the particular DNA sequence as well. The observation that a 13-mer can support ATPase activity is consistent with the helicase binding site size of 13 nt or less. The minimal length necessary for unwinding of dsDNA by Dda is a 12-nt ssDNA overhang (Krell et al., 1979). The actual binding site size awaits determination of the oligomeric nature of Dda, which can affect estimates of this value (Runyon et al., 1993). Since the differences in stimulation of Dda ATPase activity by various lengths of DNA are small and sequence sensitive, we next compared two polymers of identical sequence and greatly differing length.Figure 3:ATPase activity on varying length oligonucleotides. Sequences of oligonucleotides used to investigate the dependence of Dda ATPase activity on DNA length.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)2 Open table in a new tab Dda ATPase Activity Is Dependent on DNA LengthPoly(dT) and a short homopolymer, oligo(dT)16, were compared for their ability to support Dda ATPase stimulation. A clear difference in their ability to stimulate Dda ATPase activity was observed (Fig. 4). The Kact values for poly(dT) and oligo(dT)16 were 300 nM nt and 690 nM nt, Vmax values were 2660 nM•s-1 and 1920 nM•s-1, respectively. Young et al. (1994b) reported a similar phenomenon for the T4 41 helicase, although differences in Kact were not observed for lengths above 50 nt. The difference in the Kact values suggests that Dda translocates on ssDNA, since the lower value is seen with the longer strand as expected for a translocating helicase (Equation 2). The change in Vmax for poly(dT) compared with oligo(dT)16 suggests that the simple translocation model in Fig. S1 is inadequate for describing Dda ATPase activity. A second, kinetically distinct, step is required to account for the results in Fig. 4 and this mechanism is shown in Fig. S2. The species [E•DNA]‘ represents the Dda helicase that hydrolyzes ATP with rate constant k‘ while translocating along poly(dT). The second species “represents the helicase bound to DNA at the end of the lattice and hydrolyzes ATP with rate constant k”. The term describing dissociation from the end of the DNA lattice is kd, whereas kt is the rate constant for translocation to the end of the lattice.Figure 4:Dda ATPase activity is dependent on substrate length. ATPase activity was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of poly(dT) (▲) and oligo(dT)16 (•) using a Dda concentration of 25 nM. Data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (solid lines). The Vmax and Kact values for poly(dT) were 2660 nM•s-1 and 300 nM nt, whereas Vmax and Kact for oligo(dT)16 were 1920 nM•s-1 and 690 nM nt, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure S2:Scheme II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This mechanism is similar to that outlined by Young et al. (1994a), with the difference being that the enzyme species [E•DNA]” in Fig. S2 can hydrolyze ATP, whereas a similar species described by Young could not hydrolyze ATP. The resulting terms describing Vmax and Kact are shown in and, respectively. Vmax=[k'(kd+k-1)+k″ktkt+kd+k-1]e(Eq. 3) Kact=(kt+k-1)(kd+k-1)k1(kt+kd+k-1)(Eq. 4) The rate constant which is dependent on DNA length, kt, now appears in both the Vmax and Kact terms, indicating that both kinetic parameters can be affected by DNA lattice length, as seen in Fig. 4.ATPase Activity on ssDNA, DNA Fork Substrates, and ssDNA Bound by T4 32 ProteinHelicase translocation on DNA may be impeded by steric features within the substrate that result in changes in the helicase's ATPase activity. One potential alteration is a region of dsDNA adjacent to a ssDNA region. The ATPase activity by a helicase on ssDNA may differ from that which occurs during dsDNA unwinding. T7 gene 4 helicase exhibited lower ATPase activity on a 75-mer oligonucleotide containing a short duplex region on the 3′ end, when compared with the 75-mer alone (Notarnicola and Richardson, 1994). A short dsDNA region on the 5′ end produced no reduction in ATPase activity. These results are in accord with the unidirectional translocation of the gene 4 helicase on ssDNA. On the other hand, no change in ATPase activity was observed for T4 41 helicase when comparing M13 ssDNA with and without short oligonucleotides capable of forming dsDNA regions (Young et al., 1994b). Finally, RecBCD helicase hydrolyzes ATP more rapidly during unwinding of dsDNA than in the presence of ssDNA (Roman and Kowalczykowski, 1989). Thus, relative rates of hydrolysis of ATP during ssDNA binding and dsDNA unwinding reflect the properties of the helicase and may provide, in some cases, a means to study unidirectional translocation on ssDNA.The ATPase activity of Dda was measured using a DNA fork substrate to determine if any difference existed in stimulation of ATPase activity during unwinding of dsDNA as compared with binding to ssDNA, Fig. 5. Previous work (Raney et al., 1994) had shown that Dda unwinds the 60-mer fork until the unwinding rate and reannealing rate of product reach a steady state (˜50% when Dda is 50 nM and the 60-mer fork is 250 nM). Thus, the ATPase activity measured under steady-state conditions represents Dda ATPase activity that is stimulated partially by unwinding of the 60-mer fork DNA and partially by binding to ss 60-mer. ATPase activity is stimulated very little by blunt end dsDNA, since a 30-mer duplex at 250 nM gave rise to ATPase activity of 154 nM•s-1, whereas the ssDNA 60-mer at the same concentration produced a rate of 3400 nM•s-1 (data not shown). The ATPase data in Fig. 5 is plotted in terms of the concentration of 60-mer strands in order to compare directly the quantity of DNA used in each experiment (see Fig. 1 for sequences of the 60-mer and the 60-mer fork substrates). The data provided identical Kact values for each substrate of 150 nM strands, whereas Vmax for the ssDNA 60-mer was slightly higher than the 60-mer fork, 4940 nM•s-1versus 3890 nM•s-1. No conclusion can be drawn with regard to translocation directionality of the Dda helicase, except that the enzyme's ATPase activity is insensitive to the single strand or duplex nature of the DNA fork substrate.Figure 5:Dda ATPase activity on single strand 60-mer and partial duplex 60-mer fork substrates. ATPase activity was measured as a function of concentration of ssDNA 60-mer strands (•) and a partially duplex 60 mer fork molecules (□). For comparison, results are shown in terms of concentration of 60-mer strands, i.e. one 60-mer fork contains two 60-mer strands. Dda concentration was 50 nM. The Vmax and Kact for the 60-mer ssDNA were 4940 nM•s-1 and 150 nM strands, whereas Vmax and Kact for the 60-mer fork were 3890 nM•s-1 and 150 nM strands, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, T4 32 single strand-binding protein was bound to ssDNA in order to impede either binding and/or translocation of the Dda helicase. Data from the inhibition of T4 41 helicase ATPase activity by T4 32 single strand-binding protein has been successfully analyzed in terms of such a model (Young et al., 1994b). Dda ATPase activity was measured using poly(dT) and varying concentrations of 32 with the results being as shown in Fig. 6. At low 32 concentration, a small but reproducible enhancement of Dda ATPase activity occurs. Inhibition ensues at higher levels of 32, but the degree of inhibition does not follow that expected if 32 is preventing Dda from binding. The concentration of 32 necessary to completely cover the DNA is 71 nM based on a 7-nucleotide site size for 32 (Kowalczykowski et al., 1981). Inhibition at this concentration is only ˜30% which agrees qualitatively with previous reports (Jongeneel et al., 1984). The degree of inhibition is insufficient to pursue the analysis described by Young et al. (1994b).Figure 6:Inhibition of Dda ATPase activity by the T4 gene 32 single strand-binding protein. ATPase activity was measured with 25 nM Dda, 500 nM poly(dT), and varying amounts of 32 protein. The concentration of 32 protein necessary to completely cover the DNA is 71 nM, assuming a site size of 7 nt for 32 protein (Kowalczykowski et al., 1981). Dda ATPase activity is only partially inhibited, indicating that Dda is able to compete with 32 for DNA under these conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dda ATPase Activity on Biotinylated OligonucleotidesThe 50-mer oligonucleotide was assembled by ligation of a 23- and 27-mer as described in Kaboord and Benkovic(1993). For the biotin-labeled 50-mers, the 23-mer contained a 3′-biotin and the 27-mer contained a 5′-biotin (Fig. 7A). The 3′ or 5′-biotin-labeled 50-mers were used as substrates for stimulation of Dda ATPase activity. Streptavidin (SA) when bound to biotin would serve as blocks at the ends of the oligonucleotide. We reasoned that if Dda translocates, it would encounter the streptavidin block at an end of the oligonucleotide, and its ATPase activity might be altered. Thus, placing the block on either end of the 50-mer might provide evidence for a strong directional bias in Dda translocation on ssDNA.Figure 7:Effect of biotin/streptavidin blocks on Dda ATPase activity. ATPase activity of 25 nM Dda was measured in the presence of the 50-mer oligonucleotide containing a biotin label on either the 5′ or 3′ end. A, sequences of biotin-labeled oligonucleotides. B, Dda ATPase activity as a function of the 3′-biotin-labeled 50-mer in the presence (•) or absence (○) of 560 nM streptavidin. The Kact determined for this substrate was 19.8 ± 1.5 μM nt in the absence of SA and 2.3 ± 0.3 μM nt in the presence of SA. Vmax values in the presence and absence of SA were 3420 ± 80 nM•s-1 and 3510 ± 100 nM•s-1, respectively. C, Dda ATPase as a function of the 5′-biotin-labeled 50-mer in the presence (●) or absence (□) of 560 nM streptavidin. Kact values obtained in the presence and absence of SA were 24.0 ± 3.0 μM nt and 13.7 ± 1.0 μM nt, respectively and Vmax values in the presence and absence of SA were 3791 ± 147 nM•s-1 and 3665 ± 52 nM•s-1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The overall effect that this change may have on Vmax and Kact is difficult to evaluate due to the complexity of and. However, for an oligonucleotide, one reasonable assumption is that kt, the rate constant for translocation to the end of the DNA lattice, is large relative to k-1 and kd. This is so because the lattice is very short, and kt is length-dependent. Thus, the Kact term collapses to, and the term for Vmax collapses to. Kactoligo=kd+k-1k1(Eq. 5) Vmaxoligo=[k'(kd+k-1kt)+k″]e(Eq. 6) Placement of a block which prevents translocation from the end of the DNA effectively reduces kd to 0, thus the Kact term reduces further to in the presence of the SA block. Kactoligo-block=k-1k1(Eq. 7) Vmaxoligo-block=[k'(k-1kt)+k″]e(Eq. 8) Comparison of and enables a clear prediction that the Kact will be reduced in the presence of the SA block. Comparison of Vmax terms (and) indicates that this parameter is not expected to change in the presence of the block.Both the 3′-biotinylated and unlabeled 50-mer supported ATPase activity in the absence of streptavidin (Fig. 7B, Table 2). When streptavidin was added, the Kact for ATPase activity was reduced (Fig. 7B). The data in Fig. 7B provided a Kact of 19.8 μM nt for the 3′-biotin 50-mer in the absence of SA and a Kact of 2.3 μM nt in the presence of SA. The large difference observed in the Kact values suggests that the Dda is sequestered on the 50-mer, resulting in an increase in the residence time of Dda on the oligonucleotide in the presence of SA, as predicted if kd were effectively eliminated. The lack of a significant effect on Vmax in the presence of the block is also consistent with the kinetic model (and). The 5′-biotin 50-mer stimulated Dda ATPase activity to a similar degree as did the 3′-biotin 50-mer and the unlabeled 50-mer. The addition of SA to the 5′-biotin 50-mer had little effect on the Dda ATPase activity (Fig. 7C). The contrasting reduction in Kact for the 3′-biotin 50-mer in the presence of SA versus the lack of a similar effect for the 5′-biotin 50-mer suggests that Dda translocates in a 5′ to 3′ direction on ssDNA.We sought to determine whether the increase in ATPase activity on the 3′-biotin 50-mer in the presence of SA was due to a structural effect in the 50-mer oligonucleotide that was removed in the presence of SA. The 23-mer from which the 50-mer was constructed was found to support ATPase activity better than the 50-mer, and thus the 3′-biotin-labeled form of this oligonucleotide was used as a substrate for measuring ATPase activity. The results are shown in Table 3 along with results for the 5′-biotin 27-mer. The same trend was observed with these substrates at low DNA concentration, as was seen with the biotin-labeled 50-mers. The effects on Dda ATPase activity observed upon SA binding to the biotinylated oligonucleotides are therefore not due to a structural anomaly in the 50-mer. The low ATPase activity found with the 50-mer is probably due to a sequence effect contained within the 27-mer which also stimulated Dda ATPase activity poorly (Table 3).3 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONHelicases show a preference for unwinding a dsDNA possessing a flanking ssDNA region that serves as an initiation site for the unwinding reaction. The actual substrate may have the ssDNA as 5′ to 3′ or 3′ to 5′ with respect to the duplex with the preferred substrate bound determining the polarity of the helicase. The requirement of many helicases for a region of ssDNA implies an association of translocation on ssDNA with unwinding of dsDNA and that the two processes may share a common mechanism. One mechanism for translocation of the E. coli Rep helicase (Wong and Lohman, 1992; Amaratunga and Lohman, 1993) is based on a dimer state for the helicase with two DNA binding sites that alternatively bind to ssDNA or dsDNA in a rolling fashion. The ss/dsDNA junction provides the polarity which ensures unidirectional translocation through dsDNA, but not necessarily ssDNA. Others have proposed that the E. coli Rho helicase (Geiselmann et al., 1993), E. coli UvrD helicase (Matson, 1986), T7 gene 4 helicase (Notarnicola and Richardson, 1994), and T4 41 helicase (Young et al., 1994b) translocate undirectionally along ssRNA or ssDNA.The question of translocation on ssDNA for the T4 Dda helicase is addressed here. Previous work (Raney et al., 1994; Jongeneel et al., 1984; Krell et al., 1979) has indicated that Dda acts distributively, rapidly dissociating from DNA, making the directionality of translocation difficult to investigate with this enzyme. The precise function of Dda in vivo is not known; however it is believed to be involved in recombination and in early events in replication (Barry and Alberts, 1994; Gauss et al., 1994). The activity of Dda is not essential and can be replaced by the T4 41 helicase in conjunction with the T4 59 protein, although T4 strains which are both Dda- and 59- are not viable (Gauss et al., 1994).We sought to determine whether the 5′ to 3′ polarity observed in dsDNA unwinding by Dda (Table 1) is also reflected in the enzyme's translocation on ssDNA. No length dependence for the DNA stimulation of Dda ATPase activity has been demonstrated previously (Jongeneel et al. 1984; Krell et al., 1979). Thus, Dda might operate by a stoichiometric mechanism whereby one molecule of Dda bound near the ss/dsDNA junction could induce local melting of the dsDNA providing a region of ssDNA. A second molecule of Dda could then bind to the newly exposed ssDNA, and this process could lead to directional unwinding of dsDNA without translocation of the helicase.With varying length oligonucleotides (Table 2), no pattern for the effect of DNA length on the kinetic parameters, Kact and Vmax, was observed. Since DNA sequence may be important for this helicase, at least with oligonucleotides, we compared DNA-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of poly(dT) and oligo(dT)16 (Fig. 4) and observed a clear difference in Dda ATPase activity. The length-dependent stimulation of helicase ATPase activity was rationalized by a scheme featuring two species capable of hydrolyzing ATP. The first includes all forms of E•DNA‘ where the enzyme is within the substrate lattice; the second (E•DNA”) represents helicase bound at the ssDNA terminus (Fig. S2). Both species are assigned different turnover numbers for ATP hydrolysis with their relative concentrations reflecting the rate of conversion via kt of E•DNA‘ to E•DNA” by translocation of the helicase. This linkage explicitly introduces the dependence on ssDNA length of the ATPase activity.We then sought data for the translocation directionality of the helicase on ssDNA by using substrates containing potential translocation blocks. The T4 32 ssDNA-binding protein had been previously used to inhibit T4 41 ATPase activity and, presumably, translocation of the helicase (Young et al., 1994b). Our attempt to apply this method to Dda helicase indicated that ATPase activity on poly(dT) is not completely inhibited by 32 and may in fact be stimulated at low 32 concentrations (Fig. 6), consistent with a possible functional interaction between Dda and T4 32 protein (Formosa et al., 1983). We therefore sought a different protein block to inhibit Dda translocation. Some protein blocks do not inhibit Dda unwinding, suggesting that in these cases, Dda is capable of translocating through the block (Bedrosian and Bastia, 1991; Yancey-Wrona and Matson, 1992). Maine and Kodadek(1994) prepared a partial duplex DNA substrate containing a binding site for GAL4 and reported the reduction in ATPase activity and DNA unwinding by Dda in the presence of the GAL4•DNA complex. However, this approach does not distinguish between unidirectional and bidirectional translocation on ssDNA.Thus, we prepared two ssDNA substrates containing an asymetrically located protein block which would not be displaced by Dda. Two 50-mer oligonucleotides with a biotin label covalently attached on either the 5′ or 3′ end were constructed, that when bound to SA, provided a translocation block which was unlikely to be displaced (Fig. 7A). A similar substrate was effective in the reconstitution of the T4 polymerase holoenzyme by preventing the T4 45 protein sliding clamp from dissociating from end of the DNA during assembly of the holoenzyme complex (Kaboord and Benkovic, 1993).In the absence of SA, these substrates had little or no effect on the stimulation of the ATPase activity of Dda (compare Fig. 7 B and C, with Table 2). However, in the presence of SA, a reduction in Kact for Dda ATPase activity was observed only with the 3′-biotin labeled 50-mer (Fig. 7B). The 8-fold reduction in Kact for this substrate implies that Dda does not dissociate as rapidly from this DNA strand due to the SA block, consistent with SA acting to prevent translocation from the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide and thereby effectively eliminating kd in Fig. S2. In contrast, the addition of SA to the 5′-biotin-labeled 50-mer led to only a small increase in the Kact for Dda ATPase activity (Fig. 7C).We interpret these results to indicate that Dda translocates unidirectionally on ssDNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction. The effect of SA at the 3′ end is to sequester Dda onto the DNA, preventing rapid dissociation of the helicase from the end of the DNA (Fig. 8). One might expect that upon halting helicase translocation, the Vmax for ATPase activity would also be reduced, although the results described here indicate that no reduction has occurred. This observation suggests that enzyme translocation and ATP hydrolysis may have been decoupled. However, Dda may rebound from the SA block and continue to catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP. If this helicase, like all other DNA helicases studied to date, exists in an oligomeric form, then it should contain multiple DNA binding sites which can bind DNA in an ordered fashion coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis. Thus, while translocation from the end of the DNA is inhibited, the cycle of DNA binding events proposed to occur with helicase activity and associated ATP hydrolysis may continue. The recent observation that the E. coli RuvB helicase binds to DNA by encircling the DNA (Stasiak et al., 1994) provides an attractive means for a helicase to remain topologically bound to DNA while being inhibited from translocating due to the SA block, although the oligomeric nature of Dda has not been established. We have observed the same phenomenon with the T4 41 helicase as well; i.e. the ATPase activity of T4 41 helicase is enhanced by the 3′ SA block at low DNA concentration. 2K. D. Raney and S. J. Benkovic, unpublished observations. Figure 8:Diagram depicting Dda helicase translocation on biotin/streptavidin labeled oligonucleotides. A, 5′ to 3′ unidirectional translocation leads to rapid dissociation from the DNA end of the 5′-biotin-labeled oligonucleotide. B, dissociation from the end of the 3′-biotin-labeled oligonucleotide is blocked in the presence of streptavidin.

DNA must be melted to provide single strands (ss) for processes such as replication, recombination, and repair. The helicase enzymes responsible for providing ssDNA (Matson and Kaiser-Rogers, 1990; Lohman, 1993) apparently utilize energy available from nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis to disrupt the molecular interactions which stabilize dsDNA. However, the mechanism(s) by which the helicases transduce chemical energy to mechanical work necessary for dsDNA melting has not been established. Helicase binding to ssDNA, or in some cases dsDNA, stimulates their nucleotide triphosphatase activity, which in turn may drive protein conformational changes required for function (Wong and Lohman, 1992; Chao and Lohman, 1990; Geiselmann et al., 1993).The mechanism of dsDNA unwinding by the helicase may be related to its mechanism of translocation on ssDNA. Helicases have been categorized by their unwinding directionality, namely whether they unwind in a 5′ to 3′ or 3′ to 5′ fashion, relative to the strand on which they bind. This directional preference observed for dsDNA unwinding implies that helicases may translocate unidirectionally on ssDNA. Although translocation by the enzyme along ssDNA has been shown for a number of helicases, unidirectional translocation on ssDNA has generally not been demonstrated (Young et al., 1994b).Lohman (Wong and Lohman, 1992) has proposed a rolling mechanism for the Escherichia coli Rep helicase mode of action. This enzyme functions as a dimer in which each monomer provides a DNA binding site. Binding of one monomer to ssDNA frees the second to bind and unwind dsDNA at a ss/dsDNA junction. The proposed mechanism for E. coli Rep helicase does not necessarily require unidirectional translocation on ssDNA but relies on the polarity of the ss/dsDNA junction to provide directionality in dsDNA unwinding. von Hippel and co-workers (Geiselmann et al., 1993) have proposed a model for E. coli Rho helicase in which the enzyme translocates with a 5′ to 3′ directional bias and “unzips” an RNA/DNA hybrid. This mechanism does imply unidirectional translocation by the enzyme on ssRNA. Finally, it is possible that a helicase might unwind dsDNA without translocating via a “stoichiometric” mechanism. In this case, helicase binding near a ss/dsDNA junction induces formation of a region of ssDNA distal from the helicase binding site, to which a second molecule of the helicase may bind. The ss/dsDNA junction may thus be propagated unidirectionally without actual helicase translocation.The bacteriophage helicase Dda (DNA-dependent ATPase) has been implicated in early events in T4 DNA replication, although its precise role has yet to be determined (Barry and Alberts, 1994; Gauss et al., 1994). Dda has also been shown to stimulate the rate of DNA branch migration catalyzed by the T4 UvsX protein, a recombinase similar in function to E. coli Rec A protein (Kodadek and Alberts, 1987). Dda helicase unwinds DNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction in a distributive fashion (Jongeneel et al., 1984) with scant evidence for its translocation on DNA. In this report, the ATPase activity of Dda on different DNA strands has been used as a means to probe the possible translocation of the enzyme along ssDNA. We have constructed DNA strands of varying length as well as DNA strands containing potential blocks to translocation in order to investigate whether this enzyme translocates on ssDNA and, if so, whether translocation is directionally biased."

INTRODUCTIONIn eukaryotes, at least seven basal transcription factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and TFIIJ) are required for basal levels of transcription at promoters by RNA polymerase II in vitro (reviewed in (1Zawel L. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)). In mammalian systems, these factors assemble into functional initiation complexes in a highly ordered, stepwise fashion beginning with the binding of TFIID to the TATA box (1Zawel L. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 2Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A.

Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), while in yeast a number of factors seem to be brought in as a preassembled RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex(4Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific activators that bind to specific regulatory elements within distal promoter regions or enhancers are capable of stimulating the rate of transcription initiation. Although the precise mechanism is presently unknown, there is increasing support for models proposing that protein-protein interactions between activators and basal transcription factors play a decisive role in this process(5Lewin B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1161-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Such interactions might help to recruit these basal transcription factors or the preassembled RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex to the TATA box, stabilize intermediates in the assembly of the initiation complex, or activate certain components by inducing conformational changes.Biochemical and molecular characterization of TFIID has shown that it is a multi-subunit complex consisting of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBPTATA-binding proteinTAFTBP-associated factorPRprogesterone receptorPREprogesterone response elementsDBDDNA binding domainhPRhuman progesterone receptorCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseaaamino acid(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reaction. and a number of TBP-associated factors (TAFs)(6Dynlacht B.D.

Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), ranging from 20 to 250 kDa in size. In cell-free transcription systems reconstituted from partially purified factors, recombinant TBP is able to support basal transcription of TATA-only promoters(9Kao C.C. Lieberman P.M. Schmidt M.C. Zhou Q. Pei R. Berk A.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1646-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Peterson M.G. Tanese N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, unlike TFIID, TBP fails to mediate transcriptional stimulation by various activators, indicating that TAFs are required for this process(8Zhou Q. Lieberman P.M. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 10Peterson M.G. Tanese N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Consequently, a model has been proposed, suggesting that different activators might interact with different TAFs in the TFIID complex(3Tjian R. Maniatis T.

Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6287) Google Scholar, 20Green S. Chambon P. Nature. 1986; 324: 615-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 21Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar). Activated PR facilitates the formation of initiation complexes through binding to progesterone response elements (PREs) located in the promoter region of target genes(22Klein-Hitpass L. Tsai S.Y.

Molecular analysis has shown that PR, like other transcription activators, consists of separable domains responsible for DNA binding (DBD) and transcriptional activation(23Gronemeyer H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal activation function (AF-1) is constitutively active, whereas the activation function located within the carboxyl-terminal part (AF-2) requires hormone for its activity(24Bocquel M.T.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar).In the present study, possible interactions of hPR with a subunit of the TFIID complex were examined by protein-protein interaction assays. Our results show that the 110-kDa subunit of Drosophila TFIID (dTAFII110) is specifically bound by hPR in vitro and that this interaction is mediated by specific domains of both proteins. Transfection studies and in vitro transcription experiments revealed that the part of hPR which mediates the interaction contains a previously unidentified activation function.DISCUSSIONTo detect the interactions between hPR and dTAFII110 in vitro and to define the domains involved, we used partially purified hPR proteins bound to a Ni-NTA matrix and in vitro synthesized dTAFII110. In this assay, EtBr caused a clear inhibition (Fig. 2), indicating that DNA is somehow involved. However, since dTAFII110 alone does not stably bind to DNA (Fig. 1A, lane 5), we exclude the possibility that the association of dTAFII110 with hPR loaded beads is simply due to capturing of DNA molecules containing bound dTAFII110 through nonspecific interactions with the DNA binding domain of hPR. Furthermore, we are convinced that the binding of dTAFII110 to the Ni-NTA matrix is due to an interaction with the hPR and not mediated by a natural poly-histidine containing protein, for example TFIIA(41DeJong J. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 42Ma D. Watanabe H. Mermelstein F. Admon A. Oguri K. Sun X. Wada T. Imai T. Shiroya T. Reinberg T. Handa H. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), either present in the reticulocyte lysate or copurified with the PR proteins from infected Sf21 cells for the following reasons. First, we were able to detect hPR-dependent dTAFII110 binding also in a different assay, in which the hPR was bound to biotinylated DNA fragments immobilized to streptavidin beads (Fig. 1A). Second, the PR dependence of dTAFII110 binding to Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Fig. 2A, 4, 5, and 6) rules out the possibility that dTAFII110 is directly bound by a natural poly-histidine containing protein present in the reticulocyte lysate used to synthesize the labeled dTAFII110 proteins. Third, the negative results obtained with two different hPR mutants (MH6-ABΔcore, MH6-BΔcore, Fig. 4B), purified from infected Sf21 cells by our standard procedure, strongly argue against copurified poly-histidine containing Spodoptora proteins as being responsible for dTAFII110 binding. Furthermore, in a chromatographic analysis of a MH6-C preparation on a Superose 12 gel filtration column, only one peak of binding activity was observed, which perfectly coincided with the single MH6-C polypeptide peak at 13 kDa (data not shown). However, since the dTAFII110 proteins used in this study were assayed without further purification, we cannot exclude a model in which the hPR-dTAFII110 interaction is mediated or stabilized by an additional protein(s) present in the translation lysate. Highly purified recombinant dTAFII110 will be required to investigate this issue.Prior to this study, two activators have been shown to interact with dTAFII110, namely Sp1 and CREB(11Ferreri K. Gill G. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R.

A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Although the interaction between CREB and dTAFII110 has not been mapped to a particular region of dTAFII110(11Ferreri K. Gill G. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), sequence similarities of CREB and Sp1 activation domains suggest that these activators may target the same domain of dTAFII110(43Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 5A, work of Tjian's group (12Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) has shown that the amino-terminal 308 amino acids of dTAFII110 suffice for interaction with Sp1. In contrast, our experiments establish that the interaction with hPR does not involve the amino-terminal region but depends on a more carboxyl-terminal nonoverlapping domain of dTAFII110. Together with the results of the Sp1-dTAFII110 interaction, this study identifies dTAFII110 as the first TAF containing at least two distinct interaction surfaces mediating contacts with activators. Due to the multiplicity of activators and the limited number of TAFs, we expect that multiple interaction domains within TAF polypeptides will turn out as a more general feature of these important molecules.Work of the groups of Tjian and Roeder (44Kokubo T.

Chen J.-L. Admon A. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2587-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) has indicated that dTAFII110 makes additional contacts with several other TAFs of the TFIID complex. While most TAF-TAF interactions have not been mapped to particular domains of dTAFII110, Yokimori et al.(48Yokimori K. Chen J.-L. Admon A. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2587-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) demonstrated that dTAFII30α binds to sequences in the carboxyl-terminal part of dTAFII110 (aa 572-921). In contrast to hPR, dTAFII30α binding was absolutely dependent on the very carboxyl-terminal end of dTAFII110. Therefore, the sequence requirements for binding of hPR and dTAFII30α to dTAFII110 are clearly different.Perhaps the most surprising result of this study is that an hPR construct (MH6-C) containing only 18 amino acids of AF-1 (aa 538-555) and the DBD (aa 556-639) is sufficient for interaction with dTAFII110. Since two overlapping mutants (MH6-ABΔcore, MH6-BΔcore) containing these 18 amino acids of AF-1 are not sufficient for binding to dTAFII110, the interaction motif is at least partly contained within the DBD of hPR. Another example for an interaction between a DBD and a TAF was recently described by Chiang and Roeder (18Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G.

Our results thus support the concept that TAFs can interact with multiple distinct domains of transactivators(18Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar).By cotransfection and in vitro transcription experiments, we were able to demonstrate that the DBD of hPR, which has not been tested for transactivation potential in the studies defining AF-1 and AF-2 of hPR(24Bocquel M.T. Kumar V. Stricker C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2581-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 25Meyer M.-E. Pornon A. Ji J. Bocquel M.-T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

The presence of a previously unidentified activation function within the hPR domain mediating the interaction with dTAFII110 in vitro clearly supports our notion that this interaction reflects an important step in the mechanism of transactivation by hPR.Interestingly, mutational analysis of the rat and human glucocorticoid receptors (49Hollenberg S.M. Giguere V. Segui P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 50Miesfeld R. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1987; 236: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and the Xenopus estrogen receptor (51Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Erijman L. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24070-24076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has also revealed the presence of a transactivation function within the respective DBDs. While activation by the glucocorticoid receptor DBDs pointed to a role of a basic region immediately following the second zinc finger(49Hollenberg S.M. Giguere V. Segui P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 50Miesfeld R. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1987; 236: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), activation by the DBD of the estrogen receptor may be mediated by a short acidic tract at the carboxyl terminus of the DBD(51Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Erijman L. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24070-24076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of an activation function located in the DBD might be a more general feature of steroid receptors.Analogous to the studies that identified interactions of Sp1 and CREB with dTAFII110(11Ferreri K. Gill G. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), we have investigated interactions between a mammalian activator and a Drosophila TAF, i.e. between proteins from evolutionary widely separated organisms. Since the cDNA encoding the human homologue of dTAFII110 is not available yet, we have not been able to prove that it also interacts with hPR. However, the part of dTAFII110 sufficient for binding to hPR includes regions with extensive sequence similarity to the human homologue hTAFII130. 3R. Tjian and N. Tanese, personal communication. Our results thus raise the possibility that this part of TAFII110 contains a conserved motif mediating interactions with the highly conserved DBDs of members of the steroid receptor superfamily.Ing et al.(52Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17617-17623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that hPR and a truncated chicken PR synthesized in reticulocyte lysate and E. coli, respectively, interact specifically with the basal transcription factor TFIIB. In contrast, using baculovirus-expressed hPR that is transcriptionally active (Fig. 7B), we have been unable to detect association of hPR and TFIIB (Fig. 1B). It remains to be seen whether the different sources of the receptors or experimental differences may account for the discrepancy between the two sets of data. Interestingly, the region required for interaction with TFIIB has been mapped to a 168-amino acid fragment of chicken PR, which includes the highly conserved DBD(52Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17617-17623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since we have shown that the corresponding region of hPR mediates interaction with dTAFII110, it is feasible that the DBDs of PRs are not only involved in the formation of receptor dimers(21Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar, 25Meyer M.-E. Pornon A. Ji J. Bocquel M.-T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), in the recognition of the PREs(21Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar), and in interactions with a TAF, but also in protein-protein interactions with TFIIB(52Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17617-17623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the DBD of hPR accounts only for a small part of the overall transactivation potential of hPR (Fig. 7), it is likely that hPR contacts additional, yet unidentified components of the initiation complex, possibly through AF-1 and AF-2. Multiple interactions with members of the transcription machinery have been proposed for a growing number of transcriptional activators, including VP16 and the glucocorticoid receptor(13Goodrich J.A. Hoey T. Thut C.J. Admon A. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 75: 519-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 53McEwan I.J. Almlöf T. Wikström A.-C. Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25629-25636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a multiplicity of protein-protein contacts may enable the hPR to affect subsequent rate-limiting steps in the process of preinitiation complex formation and contribute to the highly synergistic activation observed with multiple PRs bound to closely adjacent PREs. INTRODUCTIONIn eukaryotes, at least seven basal transcription factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and TFIIJ) are required for basal levels of transcription at promoters by RNA polymerase II in vitro (reviewed in (1Zawel L. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)). In mammalian systems, these factors assemble into functional initiation complexes in a highly ordered, stepwise fashion beginning with the binding of TFIID to the TATA box (1Zawel L. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 2Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A.

Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), while in yeast a number of factors seem to be brought in as a preassembled RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex(4Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific activators that bind to specific regulatory elements within distal promoter regions or enhancers are capable of stimulating the rate of transcription initiation. Although the precise mechanism is presently unknown, there is increasing support for models proposing that protein-protein interactions between activators and basal transcription factors play a decisive role in this process(5Lewin B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1161-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Such interactions might help to recruit these basal transcription factors or the preassembled RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex to the TATA box, stabilize intermediates in the assembly of the initiation complex, or activate certain components by inducing conformational changes.Biochemical and molecular characterization of TFIID has shown that it is a multi-subunit complex consisting of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBPTATA-binding proteinTAFTBP-associated factorPRprogesterone receptorPREprogesterone response elementsDBDDNA binding domainhPRhuman progesterone receptorCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseaaamino acid(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reaction. and a number of TBP-associated factors (TAFs)(6Dynlacht B.D.

Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), ranging from 20 to 250 kDa in size. In cell-free transcription systems reconstituted from partially purified factors, recombinant TBP is able to support basal transcription of TATA-only promoters(9Kao C.C. Lieberman P.M. Schmidt M.C. Zhou Q. Pei R. Berk A.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1646-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Peterson M.G. Tanese N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, unlike TFIID, TBP fails to mediate transcriptional stimulation by various activators, indicating that TAFs are required for this process(8Zhou Q. Lieberman P.M. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 10Peterson M.G. Tanese N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Consequently, a model has been proposed, suggesting that different activators might interact with different TAFs in the TFIID complex(3Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 7Tanese N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).

Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar). Activated PR facilitates the formation of initiation complexes through binding to progesterone response elements (PREs) located in the promoter region of target genes(22Klein-Hitpass L. Tsai S.Y.

Molecular analysis has shown that PR, like other transcription activators, consists of separable domains responsible for DNA binding (DBD) and transcriptional activation(23Gronemeyer H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal activation function (AF-1) is constitutively active, whereas the activation function located within the carboxyl-terminal part (AF-2) requires hormone for its activity(24Bocquel M.T. Kumar V. Stricker C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2581-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 25Meyer M.-E. Pornon A. Ji J. Bocquel M.-T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

https://openalex.org/W2042698326,"The muscle creatine kinase gene enhancer contains two regulatory elements (MCK-R and MCK-L) with the consensus E-box sequence (CAnnTG). A myocyte specific protein complex, MEF1, binds the MCK-R site. MEF1 contains several basic H-L-H myogenic determination factors (MDFs), each dimerized with ubiquitous members of the bH-L-H family (e.g. E12/E47). We now demonstrate that the ubiquitous bH-L-H factor E2-2 is a major component of the endogenous MCK-R site specific complex.Previous studies described the MCK-L site as a similar but low affinity MDF/bH-L-H heterodimer binding site. However, we find that the MCK-L site exhibits preferential binding of an unknown ubiquitous factor which contains neither E12/E47 nor E2-2, and that it exhibits differential transcriptional activity with muscle and non-muscle cells. The differential behavior of the MCK-L and MCK-R sites may be a general trait of E-box elements since one among several E-boxes in the MLC 1/3 enhancer also binds preferentially to the MCK-L factor. From our studies we now propose separate consensus sequences for MCK-R and MCK-L E-box types: AACAc/gc/gTGCa/t and GGa/cCANGTGGc/gNa/g. Our results suggest that while many muscle gene E-boxes are capable of binding the previously characterized spectrum of MDF/bH-L-H heterodimers in vitro, MCK-L type E-boxes probably bind qualitatively different factors in vivo.

Skeletal muscle differentiation involves the coordinate activation and regulation of many hundreds of muscle specific genes. Muscle gene expression is thought to occur via the interaction of muscle specific and ubiquitous transcription factors with a common subset of cis regulatory elements(1Hauschka S.D. Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1994: 3-73Google Scholar). Among the most widely found muscle gene control elements are sequences containing the canonical E-box motif CANNTG(2Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell.

The two E-box sequences in the MCK enhancer are designated the MCK-L site and the MCK-R or MEF1 site(2Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell.

Mutation of either site in the mouse MCK enhancer causes a dramatic decrease in the transcriptional activity of reporter genes when tested in skeletal muscle cells(2Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol.

All four myogenic factors (MRF4, myf5, MyoD, and myogenin) can bind the MCK-R site as homodimers in gel shift assays but they exhibit much greater binding affinity as heterodimers with the ubiquitous H-L-H factor products of the E2A gene, E12 and E47(10Braun T.

Studies using antibodies suggest that E12 and E47 are naturally occurring participants in the MEF1 complex(15Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1156-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Based on gel mobility shift studies using in vitro translated and bacterially synthesized E-proteins such as E2-2 and HEB, it is known that other ubiquitous E-proteins can also form heterodimers with the MDFs and that these exhibit binding to E-boxes(16Lassar A.B.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, it was not known whether any of the latter heterodimers were naturally occurring in muscle nuclei. The participation of E2-2 as part of the MEF1 complex is demonstrated in this study. Much less is known about the MCK-L site. Studies with MyoD-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and in vitro translated MyoD- or myogenin-E12 heterodimers have been interpreted as indicating that the MCK-L site is a low affinity MEF1 binding site(8Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 9Brennan T.J. Olson E.N. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 582-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The finding that high level constitutive expression of MyoD in non-muscle cells can activate a thymidine kinase promoter reporter gene construct with four inserted MCK-L sites has also been interpreted as indicating interaction between MyoD and the MCK-L site(18Weintraub H. Davis R. Lockshon D. Lassar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5623-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 19Johnston L.A. Tapscott S.J. Eisen H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5123-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The possibility that the MCK-L site might bind a ubiquitous factor was suggested by analysis of the rat MCK enhancer(20Horlick R.A. Benfield P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2396-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the ubiquitous factor(s) in that study bound a region containing the MCK-L site as well as the adjacent A/T-rich site, which is known to bind both ubiquitous (21Horlick R.A. Hobson G.M. Patterson J.H. Mitchell M.T. Benfield P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4826-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and more restricted transcription factors(22Cserjesi P. Lilly B. Bryson L. Wang Y. Sassoon D.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1992; 115: 1087-1101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus the existence of a distinct MCK-L site binding factor was unclear. The CAnnTG E-box core is important for the regulation of both muscle-specific genes, and non-muscle genes, such as the immunoglobulins. Therefore, the mechanism of tissue specific gene regulation via E-box sequences must also involve sequences flanking the core CAnnTG and/or the internal undefined bases. A consensus sequence for generic muscle E-box binding sites based on sequence comparisons of the MCK-L and MCK-R sites as well as the E-boxes found in the regulatory regions of other muscle genes was proposed several years ago (2Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Subsequent experimental evidence from polymerase chain reaction based MDF/E2A protein binding site selection protocols suggested very similar consensus sequences and confirmed the importance of the flanking sequences for determining the unique binding sites for MyoD/E2A and myogenin/E2A heterodimers(23Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 24Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Functional evidence for the effects of flanking sequence differences on E-box activity was obtained by studies of the troponin I enhancer in which the endogenous E-box and flanking sequences were replaced with E-box and flanking sequences from both muscle and non-muscle genes(25Yutzey K.E. Konieczny S.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5105-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These studies are all consistent with the concept that sequences flanking the core E-box in muscle-specific genes play an important role in regulating gene expression. To better understand the complexities of muscle-specific gene regulation, we have studied differences between the MCK E-box sites with respect to their transcriptional activities and their binding factor interactions. We have also examined transcriptional differences between the MCK-L and MCK-R sites in the absence of other muscle regulatory sequences. To determine if the two E-box elements are simply low and high affinity sites for the same nuclear factors we analyzed qualitative differences in the factors which preferentially bind the two sites. Then by examining the binding preferences of E-box sequences found in the myosin light chain 1/3 enhancer we investigated whether factor binding differences between the MCK E-boxes are specific to the MCK gene or represent a more general mechanism of muscle gene regulation. The results suggest that factor interaction at muscle E-box regulatory sites is more complex than can be explained by the hypothesis of high and low affinity MDF binding sites. We propose that E-box elements of the MCK-L type interact with a ubiquitous binding complex that contains none of the common MDF/E-protein heterodimers that bind E-boxes of the MCK-R type. The plasmid pUC-E used for mutagenesis has been described elsewhere(2Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used to produce the mutations were made by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Chemical Synthesis facility at the University of Washington. The mutagenesis was done by standard single stranded mutagenesis protocols (26Zoller M.J. Smith M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 329-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). pUC-E plasmids containing the mutations were sequenced to confirm that only the expected mutation was present. The reference plasmid pUCSV2pap, a derivative of pSV2pap, encodes human placental alkaline phosphatase and was used to normalize for transfection efficiency differences as described elsewhere(7Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). MM14 myoblasts were grown in Ham's F-10C, 15% horse serum, and 2 ng/ml bovine fibroblast growth factor on collagen-coated plates as described previously(28Clegg C.H. Linkhart T.A. Olwin B.B. Hauschka S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected at a density of 5 × 105 per 100-mm plate with 8 μg of test construct and 2 μg of pUCSV2pap (2Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 7Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 4 h after addition of DNA, cells were glycerol shocked and refed. In myocyte experiments the cells were differentiated by replacing growth media with differentiation media consisting of Ham's F-10C, 1.5% horse serum, and 6 μg/ml insulin after glycerol shock. In myoblast transfections the cells were refed growth media after glycerol shock to maintain proliferation. Both differentiated myocytes and proliferating myoblasts were harvested 26 h after transfection. Cells were harvested and enzyme assays performed as described previously(7Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were grown and transfected as above except that the cells were switched into conditioned media after glycerol shock. Conditioned medium was F-10C, 1.5% horse serum that had been incubated on confluent NIH3T3 cells until there was no apparent cell division (typically 48 h after medium addition). Statistical analysis of transfection results was done by ANOVA using the SAS computer program. Nuclear extracts of MM14 myocytes, myoblasts, and NIH3T3 cells were made essentially as described by Dignam et al.(29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and Buskin and Hauschka(2Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Mouse tissue nuclear extracts were made following the protocol of Zahradka et al.(30Zahradka P. Larson D.E. Sells B.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 185: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All solutions used in the extraction protocol contained protease inhibitors at the following concentration, 84 KIU/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/μl pepstatin, 1 μg/μl leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 0.5-1 mg of myocyte nuclear extract protein was loaded on a 1-ml heparin-agarose (Sigma, Type 1) column equilibrated at 4°C in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. The column was washed with 2 volumes of loading buffer, and the wash was collected for analysis by a gel mobility shift assay. Proteins were eluted with a step gradient of increasing KCl concentrations in loading buffer. Steps were 1.5 column volumes of 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 M KCl collected in 125-μl fractions. A small aliquot from each fraction was analyzed for protein. Fractions were pooled and concentrated with Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon), dialyzed against loading buffer modified to 20% glycerol, quick frozen in aliquots in an ethanol dry ice bath, and stored at −70°C until analysis via gel mobility shift assays. Gel shift assays were performed essentially as described by Buskin and Hauschka(2Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5-1 μg of column pools or 1-4 μg of tissue extracts were incubated with end-labeled double stranded oligomers representing various mouse MCK and rat MLC 1/3 gene E-box sites plus immediate flanking DNA: MCK-L (ATTAACCCAGACATGTGGCTGCCCC), MCK-R (GATCCCCCCAACACCTGCTGCCTGA), MLC-A (TCCATTTTTGCACCTGCTGCG ACTT), MLC-B (GTTGCTTCGCCAGCTGGTGGGGATT), and MLC-C (AGGAATTAGGCACCTGTTGCTTCGC), in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and poly(dI-C)•(dI-C) in a final volume of 10 μl. Samples were incubated on ice for 20 min, room temperature for 5 min, and loaded onto a native 6% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run at 4°C in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5, and 1 mM EDTA at 200 V for 2 h, dried, and exposed to film. For competition experiments proteins were incubated for 10 min on ice prior to the addition of probe with 30-40-fold excess of the unlabeled 220-bp BamH/HindIII enhancer fragment from pUC-E vector containing a mutation in the MCK-L or MCK-R site (previously described in (7Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and (8Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar)). In antibody studies protein fractions were incubated on ice for 10 min prior to the addition of probe with 1 μl of sera or IgGs purified by protein A chromatography. pUC-E was linerized with either HindIII or BamHI and labeled by filling in with Klenow fragment. The enhancer fragment was then excised with BamHI or HindIII and the end was filled in with Klenow fragment to blunt the end. The labeled enhancer fragment was purified by running on a 6% acrylamide gel and cutting out the appropriate band from the wet gel. The DNA was eluted from the gel slice with 0.2 M NaCl, 0.02 M Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mM EDTA. The eluted DNA was purified over an Elutip (Schleicher and Schuell) column as described by the manufacturer and ethanol-precipitated. 2 × 106 cpm (Cerenkov counting) of probe was dissolved in 10 μl of water. The DNA was methylated by addition of 1.5 μl of 1:40 dimethyl sulfate and incubation at 37°C for 30 min. The methylated DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 10 μl of water. For a preparative gel mobility shift 5.0 × 104 cpm of methylated probe was incubated with 2 μg of protein from heparin column fractions and 360 ng of poly(dI-C)•(dI-C) as above. Bound and free probe were excised from the wet gel and eluted and purified as above. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 1 M piperidine and incubated at 90°C for 30 min. Cleaved DNA was lyophilized. The pellet was resuspended in 80% formamide Tris borate/EDTA buffer, and 1 × 103 cpm of bound or free probe was loaded into each lane of a 6% denaturing sequencing gel. To determine whether the MCK-L and MCK-R sites exhibit functional differences we examined the activity of artificial genes containing four contiguous MCK-L or MCK-R sites fused to the thymidine kinase promoter and chloramphenicol acetyltranferase reporter gene (CAT). The experimental advantage of the 4RtkCAT and 4LtkCAT constructs is that they permit analysis of the MCK-R and MCK-L sites independently of possible interactions with other sites within the MCK enhancer. The transient expression of these constructs was examined in replicating and differentiated skeletal muscle cells (MM14 myoblasts and myocytes) as well as in mitogen-deprived non-muscle (NIH 3T3 cells). The purpose of the latter comparison was to test the expression of the L- and R-MCK E-boxes in a non-myogenic cell that had been subjected to similar growth arrest conditions as those required for converting replicating myoblasts to the differentiated state. Data from these studies suggest transcriptional differences between the MCK-R and MCK-L sites (Fig. 1). The absolute activity levels of tkCAT are similar in 3T3 cells myoblasts, and myocytes, but activity differences are observed when MCK-L or MCK-R sites are combined with the tk promoter. In 3T3 cells, the activity of 4LtkCAT is 2-fold higher than that of the tk promoter alone while the 4RtkCAT construct is 4-fold lower than that of the tk promoter alone (Fig. 1A). This indicates that the MCK-L site is not muscle-specific when removed from the context of the MCK enhancer. In addition, the decreased activity of 4RtkCAT suggests that the MCK-R site may bind factors in non-muscle cells that repress expression from the ubiquitously active tk promoter (see “Discussion”). Results from the myoblast transfection study are similar to those with 3T3 cells: the activity of 4LtkCAT is 5-fold higher than that of tkCAT while that of 4RtkCAT is 2-fold lower (Fig. 1B). Since it is impossible to grow myoblast cultures without a low background of differentiated myocytes (see Fig. 1legend), the true relative repression of 4RtkCAT in myoblasts is probably severalfold greater than the 2-fold repression level observed. In contrast to their behavior in fibroblasts and myoblasts, both minimal E-box promoters exhibit significantly elevated expression in differentiated muscle cells (15-20-fold) over that of tkCAT alone (Fig. 1C). However, although both constructs have similar absolute expression levels in myocytes, 4RtkCAT exhibits a 50-100-fold induction in activity during the transition from myoblasts to myocytes, while the induction of 4LtkCAT during differentiation is only 3-fold, since this construct is also expressed at relatively high levels in myoblasts. Based on these results we conclude that the MCK-L and MCK-R sites exhibit quantitatively distinct transcriptional enhancements when tested in the absence of other muscle regulatory elements. In addition, the MCK-R site appears to bind factors that repress gene expression in non-muscle cells and in replicating myoblasts. The transcriptional enhancement of the basal tk promoter by the MCK-L site and the repression of basal tk promoter activity by the MCK-R site in fibroblasts provides strong evidence that these E-boxes bind distinct factors. To determine whether NIH3T3 cells contain MCK-L and MCK-R specific binding activities, 3T3 cell nuclear extracts were examined via gel mobility shift assays for factors capable of binding labeled MCK-L and MCK-R oligomers. The specificity of binding was determined by competing with unlabeled 206-bp enhancer fragments containing mutations in either the MCK-L or MCK-R sites (Fig. 2A). The MCK-L probe exhibits several shifted bands with 3T3 nuclear extract; one of these (labeled 1) is competed with an enhancer containing a wild type MCK-L site and a mutant MCK-R site, while an enhancer containing a wild type MCK-R site and a mutant MCK-L site does not compete (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2). The complex migrating as band 1 thus appears to be MCK-L site-specific. The MCK-R probe also exhibits several shifted bands. A component in one of the bands (labeled 2) appears to be MCK-R site-specific as demonstrated by partial competition of band 2 with the enhancer containing a wild type MCK-R site (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4). The MCK-L and MCK-R specific complexes (bands 1 and 2) could represent the interaction of these sites with the MCK-L site activators and MCK-R site repressors that are responsible for the different transcriptional activities of the 4LtkCAT and 4RtkCAT constructs in 3T3 cells. The observed transcriptional differences between the MCK-L and MCK-R sites in non-myocytes and myocytes, as well as the apparent binding of distinct complexes in 3T3 cell nuclear extracts, suggest these control elements may also bind different factors in myocytes. To facilitate a more detailed analysis of MCK-L and MCK-R binding factors, myocyte nuclear extracts were partially purified by heparin-agarose column chromatography. A typical chromatographic profile of a myocyte nuclear extract eluted with a step gradient of increasing KCl concentrations is shown in Fig. 3A. The elution profile is composed of several major protein peaks (Fig. 3A), the fractions of which were pooled as indicated by the horizontal bars, and then concentrated. Approximately 50% of the total protein loaded on the column was recovered in the concentrated pooled fractions. To determine where potential MCK-L and MCK-R factors elute from the heparin-agarose column, the pooled fractions were analyzed by gel mobility shift assays using MCK-L or MCK-R site oligomers as probes (Fig. 3B). With the MCK-R probe, a binding activity which is characteristic of the previously reported MEF1 complex(2Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), is detected in fractions C and D as a broad region containing at least two shifted complexes (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 8). Studies from our laboratory and by other investigators suggest that the upper MEF1 band contains MyoD and the lower band contains myogenin(16Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 31Chakraborty T. Brennan T. Olson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2878-2882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MCK-R probe also exhibits binding to a broad band (complex 3), but this binding is nonspecific (see Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5). A similar nonspecific complex is observed when the heparin column fractions are assayed with an MCK-L site probe. However, the MCK-L probe also exhibits specific binding (complex 1). The complex 1 factor is found predominately in fraction D, with smaller amounts in fraction C (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Complex 1 appears to be MCK-L site-specific because it is not seen in fraction D when examined with the MCK-R probe (compare Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 8). Furthermore, under these conditions, MEF1 does not bind the MCK-L probe (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 7). The specificity of DNA binding activity detected in the heparin-agarose column fractions was determined by competition gel mobility shift assays using various unlabeled MCK enhancer fragments. The DNA fragments used as competitors were the BamHI/HindIII fragments from pUC-E that contain mutations in either the MCK-R or MCK-L site (Fig. 4A). These mutations are known to decrease enhancer function in muscle cell culture(2Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 7Amacher S.L.

Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Competition with an enhancer fragment containing a mutated MCK-L site (mt1) but a wild type MCK-R site decreases binding of the MEF1 complex to the MCK-R probe (Fig. 4B, lane 5). However, an enhancer fragment with a mutant MCK-R site but wild type MCK-L site does not compete for MEF1 binding to the MCK-R probe (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 4 and 5). This demonstrates that only wild type MCK-R sites compete well for the MCK-R site binding activity (MEF1) in fraction C. In contrast, an enhancer fragment containing a wild type MCK-L site, but not enhancer fragments containing either a 5-bp MCK-L mutation (mt1) or a 2-bp MCK-L mutation (mt2), competes for binding of the MCK-L site complex-1 to the MCK-L site probe (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1, 2, and 3). These results indicate that complex-1 contains a MCK-L site-specific binding factor. Significantly, it is not necessary to fractionate the nuclear extract to detect MCK-L site binding, since high levels of this activity are also detected in unfractionated myocyte nuclear extract (data not shown). Methylation interference was used to define the MCK-L binding site and to determine if the MCK-L factor (complex 1) binds within the consensus E-box region (Fig. 5). The interference pattern generated by the MCK-L site factor is similar, but not identical, to the pattern we have published with MyoD at the MCK-L site(8Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). For the top strand the G at position +1 and +3 are important contact points while the G residue at position +4 is not methylated in either the free probe lane or the bound lane, suggesting that residue +3 is under-methylated in the probe. On the bottom strand there is partial interference at positions −3 and +5. Based on the overall pattern of methylation interference with the MCK-L factor, a typical core E-box sequence, CATGTG, is at the midpoint of the MCK-L site element. These results coupled with the competiti"

https://openalex.org/W2033471769,"A potential distinguishing feature between protein tyrosine kinases and homologous serine/threonine kinases is the function of the catalytic base in these enzymes. In this study, we show that a peptide containing the unnatural amino acid trifluorotyrosine shows remarkably similar efficiency as a substrate of the tyrosine kinase Csk (C-terminal Src kinase) compared with the corresponding tyrosine-containing peptide despite a 4-unit change in the phenolic pKa. These results argue against the importance of early tyrosine deprotonation by a catalytic base in Csk. To further explore the role of the proposed catalytic base, the Csk mutant protein D314E was produced. This mutant displayed a significant reduction in km (approximately 104) but relatively little effect on substrate Km values compared with wild-type Csk. Examination of the thio effect (km-ATP/km-adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)) for D314E Csk led to the suggestion that a role of aspartate 314 may be to enhance the reactivity of the γ-phosphate of ATP toward electrophilic attack. These results may have significant impact on protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor design."
https://openalex.org/W1974715440,"Efficient translation of the mRNA encoding the 65-kDa regulatory subunit (PR65α) of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is prevented by an out of frame upstream AUG and a stable stem-loop structure (ΔG = −55.9 kcal/mol) in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR). Deletion of the 5′-UTR allows efficient translation of the PR65α message in vitro and overexpression in COS-1 cells. Insertion of the 5′-UTR into the β-galactosidase leader sequence dramatically inhibits translation of the β-galactosidase message in vitro and in vivo, confirming that this sequence functions as a potent translation regulatory sequence. Cells transfected or microinjected with a PR65α expression vector lacking the 5′-UTR, express high levels of PR65α, accumulating in both nucleus and cytoplasm.

Efficient translation of the mRNA encoding the 65-kDa regulatory subunit (PR65α) of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is prevented by an out of frame upstream AUG and a stable stem-loop structure (ΔG = −55.9 kcal/mol) in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR). Deletion of the 5′-UTR allows efficient translation of the PR65α message in vitro and overexpression in COS-1 cells. Insertion of the 5′-UTR into the β-galactosidase leader sequence dramatically inhibits translation of the β-galactosidase message in vitro and in vivo, confirming that this sequence functions as a potent translation regulatory sequence. Cells transfected or microinjected with a PR65α expression vector lacking the 5′-UTR, express high levels of PR65α, accumulating in both nucleus and cytoplasm. PR65α overexpressing rat embryo fibroblasts (REF-52 cells) become multinucleated. These data and previous results (Mayer-Jaekel, R. E., Ohkura, H., Gomes, R., Sunkel, C.

https://openalex.org/W2002371787,"To understand the mechanism of affinity maturation, we examined the antigen-antibody interactions between 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP) caproic acid and the Fab fragments of three anti-NP antibodies, N1G9, 3B44, and 3B62, by isothermal titration calorimetry. The analyses have revealed that all of these interactions are mainly driven by negative changes in enthalpy. The enthalpy changes decreased linearly with temperature in the range of 25-45°C, producing negative changes in heat capacity. On the basis of the dependence of binding constants on the sodium chloride concentration, we have shown that, during the affinity maturation of the anti-NP antibody, the electrostatic effect does not significantly contribute to the increase in the binding affinity. We have found that, as the logarithm of the binding constants increases during the affinity maturation of the anti-NP antibody, the magnitudes of the corresponding enthalpy, heat capacity, and unitary entropy changes increase almost linearly. On the basis of this correlation, we have concluded that, during the affinity maturation of the anti-NP antibody, a better surface complementarity is attained in the specific complex in order to obtain a higher binding affinity."

The enzyme catalyzed the transfer of [3H]GalNAc from UDP-[3H]GalNAc to linkage tetrasaccharide and hexasaccharide serines synthesized chemically and to various regular oligosaccharides containing terminal D-glucuronic acid (GlcA), which were prepared from chondroitin and chondroitin sulfate using testicular hyaluronidase digestion. The labeled products obtained with the linkage tetra- and hexasaccharide serines and with the tetrasaccharide (GlcAβ1-3GalNA)2 were resistant to digestion with chondroitinase AC-II and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase but sensitive to α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase digestion, indicating that the enzyme is an α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. This finding is in contrast to that of Rohrmann et al. (Rohrmann, K., Niemann, R., and Buddecke, E.(1985) Eur. J. Biochem., 148, 463-469), who reported that a corresponding product was susceptible to digestion with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. The presence of a sulfate group at C4 of the penultimate GalNAc or Gal units markedly inhibited the transfer of GalNAc to the terminal GlcA, while a sulfate group at C6 of the GalNAc had little effect on the transfer. Moreover, a slight but significant transfer of GalNAc was observed to an oligosaccharide containing terminal 2-O-sulfated GlcA as acceptor, whereas no incorporation was detected into oligosaccharides containing terminal unsaturated or 3-O-sulfated GlcA units. These results suggest that this novel serum enzyme is a UDP-GalNAc:chondro-oligosaccharide α1-3- or 1-4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. The possibility of involvement of this enzyme in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis is discussed.

The possibility of involvement of this enzyme in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis is discussed. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans including heparin/heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate are covalently bound to Ser residues in the core proteins through the common carbohydrate-protein linkage structure, GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser (for reviews, see (1Lindahl U.

Heparin/heparan sulfate is synthesized once GlcNAc is transferred to the common linkage region, while chondroitin sulfate is formed if GalNAc is first added.

The transferases for the first GlcNAc and GalNAc residues are thought to be different from the glycosyltransferases catalyzing the elongation steps, which transfer GlcNAc or GalNAc to the corresponding repeating disaccharide region.

Even-numbered regular chondro-oligosaccharides (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)2, (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)3, and (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)4 were prepared by hyaluronidase digestion of chondroitin followed by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (1.6 × 95 cm), and then HPLC on an amine-bound silica column as previously described(15Sugahara K.

Incubation mixtures contained the following constituents in a total volume of 35 μl: 1 nmol of a linkage tetra- or a hexasaccharide serine, a chondro-oligosaccharide, or 300 μg of chondroitin, 8.57 μM UDP-[3H]GalNAc (5.28 × 105 dpm), 50 mM MES buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mM MnCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 171 μM ATP, and 18 μl of fetal bovine serum. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 21 h, and the reactions were terminated by addition of 35 μl of cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The mixtures were centrifuged for 5 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at top speed. The supernatant (65 μl) was extracted twice with 1 ml of ether, and the lower aqueous phase was subjected to chromatography on a column (1 × 106 cm) of Sephadex G-25 (superfine) equilibrated and eluted with 0.25 M NH4HCO3-7% 1-propanol. Fractions (1 ml each) were collected at a rate of 4.8 ml/h and analyzed for radioactivity. Isolation of the products from GalNAc transferase reactions was carried out by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (1 × 106 cm), which was eluted with 0.25 M NH4HCO3, 7% 1-propanol. Digestion of the isolated products with chondroitinase AC-II, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, or α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase was performed essentially according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, labeled products (about 1.5 pmol) corresponding to 2000-2500 dpm were incubated at 37°C overnight with 100 mIU of chondroitinase AC-II in a total volume of 40 μl of 30 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, or with 500 mIU of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase or 52 mIU of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in a total volume of 25 μl of 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.5, respectively. The enzyme digest was diluted to 200 μl with 0.25 M NH4HCO3, 7% 1-propanol and analyzed using the same Sephadex G-25 column as above. The competition experiments between the chondro-oligosaccharide (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)2 and either lacto-N-fucopentaose I or apomucin for the α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase in the heat-treated serum (50°C for 60 min) were performed in the reaction mixture described above. Incubation mixtures contained either 1 nmol of the lacto-N-fucopentaose I and 10 nmol of the chondro-oligosaccharide (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)2 or 1 nmol of the chondro-oligosaccharide (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)2 and 300 μg of apomucin. After the reaction, the radioactive products were analyzed using a Sephadex G-25 column as described above. The products obtained with two acceptors in each competition experiment were well separated by gel filtration. Fetal bovine serum was tested as an enzyme source for GalNAc transferase since several biosynthetic enzymes for chondroitin sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate have been demonstrated to occur at high concentrations in serum(16Inoue H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20705-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the serum enzymes are stable and occur in soluble forms in nature. Fetal bovine serum also contains an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of [3H]GalNAc from UDP-[3H]GalNAc to polymeric chondroitin(20Kitagawa H. Tsuchida K. Ujikawa M. Sugahara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study, we first investigated the role of C4 sulfation of the Gal residue linked to GlcA in the linkage region in the chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis using a nonsulfated tetrasaccharide linkage region GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser and a sulfated counterpart GlcAβ1-3Gal(4-sulfate)β1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser as acceptors in the serum GalNAc transferase assay. The former was a good acceptor for GalNAc transferase, and the reaction product was eluted at a position corresponding to a pentasaccharide upon Sephadex G-25 column gel filtration (Fig. 1 solid lines). In contrast, the latter compound gave an elution profile similar of the control (Fig. 1 broken lines) and therefore could not serve as an acceptor substrate when assayed under the same conditions as used for the nonsulfated compound. The results indicate that C4 sulfation of the Gal completely precludes the transfer of the first GalNAc residue to the linkage tetrasaccharide core. To assess the effects of C4 sulfation of the Gal and/or the first GalNAc residue on the transferase reaction of the second GalNAc residue, a nonsulfated, a monosulfated, and a disulfated hexasaccharide serine were used as acceptor substrates for the serum enzyme. As shown in Fig. 2 the nonsulfated compound GlcAβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser was the best substrate (A) followed by the disulfated compound GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4-sulfate)β1-4GlcAβ1-3Gal(4-sulfate)β1- 3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser (C), while little incorporation into the monosulfated compound GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4-sulfate)β1- 4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser (B) was observed. These results indicate that C4 sulfation of the first GalNAc residue is inhibitory to the transfer of the second GalNAc residue and that C4 sulfation of the Gal residue also has some regulatory effects on the reaction. All the above results seemed to suggest that fetal bovine serum contains GalNAc transferase(s) involved in the chain initiation and elongation of chondroitin. Previously, Rohrmann et al.(21Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) proposed that at least two GalNAc transferase activities exist in the microsomal fraction of calf arterial tissue. One, designated GalNAc transferase I (GalNAc T-I), catalyzed transfer of the first GalNAc residue immediately adjacent to the linkage region. The other, designated GalNAc transferase II (GalNAc T-II), was involved in polymerization of the chondroitin sulfate chain. In addition, they also showed that these two enzymes differed in their temperature stability; the former was stable while the latter was labile on heat treatment at 50°C for 60 min. Therefore, we attempted to clarify whether the same holds true for the serum enzymes. Fetal bovine serum was treated at 50°C for 60 min, and GalNAc T-I and −II were assayed using the nonsulfated tetrasaccharide serine GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser and polymeric chondroitin as acceptors, respectively. In addition, the nonsulfated hexasaccharide serine GlcAβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser was also used as an acceptor. GalNAc T-I measured with the tetrasaccharide serine retained its full activity and even exhibited elevated activity (2.6-fold), while the residual activity of the GalNAc T-II measured with polymeric chondroitin was less than 5% of that obtained with the non-heat-treated serum. Surprisingly, an enzyme that utilized the nonsulfated hexasaccharide serine as an acceptor was stable to the heat treatment and even showed elevated activity (3.3-fold). Although the reason why the heat treatment of the serum resulted in the apparent elevation of the GalNAc T-I activity is unclear, it was most likely due to the inactivation of serum nucleotide pyrophosphatase and phosphatase, which hydrolyze the donor substrate UDP-GalNAc to GalNAc 1-phosphate and GalNAc, respectively. These results suggest that the GalNAc transferase, which utilized the tetrasaccharide and the hexasaccharide serines, is different from that which utilized polymeric chondroitin and that fetal bovine serum contains at least two GalNAc transferase activities as in the case of the microsomal enzymes from calf arterial tissue. To investigate the structure of the reaction products obtained by incubation of the non-heat-treated serum enzyme with the tetrasaccharide and the hexasaccharide serines, aliquots of the reaction products were treated with chondroitinase AC-II, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, or α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, and the samples were analyzed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column. The products were compared with those obtained with polymeric chondroitin as an acceptor (Fig. 3). Unexpectedly, none of the [3H]GalNAc transferred to the nonsulfated tetrasaccharide serine was released as free [3H]GalNAc either by chondroitinase AC-II (panel A-a in Fig. 3) or by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (panel A-b). In contrast, 100 or 90% of the [3H]GalNAc transferred to polymeric chondroitin was released by either one of these enzymes (panels C-a and C-b). Surprisingly, the reaction product obtained with the tetrasaccharide serine as an acceptor was sensitive to digestion with α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase yielding quantitatively a 3H-labeled peak at the position of free [3H]GalNAc (panel A-c), whereas that obtained with polymeric chondroitin was insensitive (panel C-c). The radiolabeled product obtained with the nonsulfated hexasaccharide serine was not degraded by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (panel B-b), whereas the 3H radioactivity was almost completely released by α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase as free [3H]GalNAc (panel B-c). When the transferase reaction product was digested with chondroitinase AC-II, a 3H-labeled oligosaccharide, most likely a trisaccharide GalNAcα1-GlcAβ1-3GalNAc, was generated (panel B-a). It should be noted that authentic GalNAcβ1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser, which was prepared by β-glucuronidase treatment of the chemically synthesized hexasaccharide serine, could be digested with either chondroitinase AC-II or β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, as judged by HPLC (data not shown). These results indicate that the enzyme in non-heat-treated serum, which utilized the tetrasaccharide and the hexasaccharide serines as acceptor substrates, was exclusively an α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. In view of the specificity of the GalNAc transferase toward the linkage tetra- and hexasaccharide serines, the acceptor specificity of the enzyme in the non-heat-treated serum was determined toward even-numbered regular chondro-oligosaccharides (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)2, (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)3, and (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)4. The serum enzymes utilized all three oligosaccharides for GalNAc transferase reactions, although no obvious size-dependent incorporation was observed (Fig. 4). Since both α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase are present in bovine serum as described above, the reaction products were examined in terms of their sensitivity to α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 the product obtained with (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)2 was completely digested with α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase but not with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, suggesting that GalNAc had been transferred to (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)2 exclusively through an α-linkage. In contrast, 42 and 58% of the product obtained with (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)3 was sensitive to digestion with α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, respectively. Similarly, 67 and 33% of the product obtained with (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)4 was sensitive to these enzymes, respectively. These results indicate that the reaction products with (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)3 and (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)4 were formed by the action of both α-N- and β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases when non-heat-treated serum was used as an enzyme source. It should be emphasized that the regular tetrasaccharide could not serve as an acceptor for β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase despite its presence in the serum. As mentioned above, GalNAc incorporation into acceptor substrates through an α- or a β-linkage could readily be distinguished by the differential thermostability of these two enzymes. Accordingly, the products obtained by incubation of the heat-treated serum with (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)2, (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)3 and (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)4 were tested in terms of their sensitivity to digestion with α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. The [3H]GalNAc-labeled products obtained with all three acceptors were completely digested with α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (data not shown). Thus, the heat treatment was useful to preclude the effect of the β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity in bovine serum. To investigate the novelty of the α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, substrate competition experiments were carried out. To our knowledge, three other α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases have so far been investigated in detail. One of these enzymes, which is involved in the synthesis of Forssman antigen GalNAcα1-3GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glc(22Taniguchi N. Yokosawa N. Gasa S. Makita A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10631-10637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was clearly different from the α-GalNAc T described in this study based on its marginal activity in heat-treated serum as detected with globo-N-tetraose (GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glc) (Table 1). The activity of another α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, blood group A-specific α-GalNAc transferase(23Clausen H. White T. Takio K. Titani K. Stroud M. Holmes E. Karkov J. Thim L. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1139-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was detected even in heat-treated serum using lacto-N-fucopentaose I (Fucα1-2Galβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glc) as an acceptor. However, the GalNAc transfer to lacto-N-fucopentaose I was not inhibited by (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)2 as examined by gel filtration of the transferase reaction products on Sephadex G-25 (Table 1), indicating that the α-GalNAc T in question is different from blood group A-specific α-GalNAc transferase. It was also distinguished from the polypeptide α-GalNAc transferase responsible for the biosynthetic initiation of O-linked oligosaccharides, which catalyzes the transfer of an α-GalNAc to a serine or a threonine residue on the protein acceptor(14Sugiura M. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9501-9507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since the GalNAc transfer to (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)2 was not inhibited by apomucin prepared from bovine submaxillary mucin (Table 1). Thus, the α-GalNAc T demonstrated in this study appears to be a hitherto unreported new transferase.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To further characterize the substrate specificity of the α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase in heat-treated serum, a variety of acceptor substrates prepared from chondroitin and chondroitin sulfates were employed, and the results are summarized in Table 2. Essentially, each substrate carrying a terminal saturated GlcA residue except for GlcA(3-sulfate)β1- 3GalNAc(4-sulfate)β1-4GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4-sulfate) could serve as an acceptor. At a fixed substrate concentration of 28.6 μM, (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)2 was the best substrate followed by (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc)3. The transfer rates to nonsulfated tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides decreased with increasing chain length. It should be noted that, as observed with the hexasaccharide serines as acceptor substrates, a 4-sulfate group on the penultimate GalNAc inhibited GalNAc incorporation onto the terminal GlcA residue. In contrast, three acceptor substrates containing a 6-sulfate group on the penultimate GalNAc residue, GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(6-sulfate)β1-4GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(±4sulfate) and (GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(6-sulfate))3, served as good acceptors, indicating that the 6-sulfate groups have little or no inhibitory effect on chain elongation. A low but significant level of incorporation was also observed into GlcA(2-sulfate)β1-3GalNAc(6-sulfate)β1-4GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4-sulfate) despite the presence of a 2-sulfate group on the non-reducing terminal GlcA, indicating that this enzyme is not an α1-2-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. In contrast, no incorporation was observed into the tetra- or hexasaccharide serines containing terminal unsaturated GlcA or into GlcA(3-sulfate)β1-3GalNAc(4-sulfate)β1-4GlcAβ1-3GalNAc(4-sulfate) even at 143 μM. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that GalNAc was in fact transferred to the non-reducing terminal GlcA residue of the acceptor chondro-oligosaccharides in an α1-3 or an α1-4 linkage.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In this paper, we describe for the first time a unique α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (α-GalNAc T), which catalyzes the transfer of an α-GalNAc to the linkage tetrasaccharide and hexasaccharide serines derived from chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and to the even-numbered regular condro-oligosaccharides. Since no α-GalNAc-terminated structure has been so far reported in naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan chains, a question may arise whether the α-GalNAc T in the serum is a minor curiosity. Based upon the specific activity of the nucleotide sugar substrate, it is calculated that about 4 pmol of the α-GalNAc T reaction product was obtained when 1 nmol of the linkage tetrasaccharide was used as an acceptor substrate, which is comparable with about 6 pmol of the GalNAc transferase II product obtained with 300 μg (>10 nmol) of chondroitin as an acceptor substrate under the same incubation conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thus, the α-GalNAc T in the serum has a comparable activity with that of the GalNAc transferase II and may play a role in galactosaminoglycan biosynthesis. Despite the synthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans on the common carbohydrate-protein linkage region GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser, the biosynthetic sorting mechanisms that determine whether galactosaminoglycans (chondroitin/dermatan sulfate) or glucosaminoglycans (heparin/heparan sulfate) assemble on the linkage region remain to be elucidated. We have been working on the hypothesis that there may be some structural differences in the common linkage regions among the different glycosaminoglycans. Structural studies of the linkage oligosaccharides isolated from various glycosaminoglycans revealed that the 4-sulfated and the 6-sulfated galactose residues could only be detected in the linkage region of chondroitin and/or dermatan sulfate(3Sugahara K.

Therefore, one can suspect that the sulfate groups inhibit heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthesis and/or promote the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate pathway. In this regard, it is interesting that glycoserines and regular oligosaccharides with 4-sulfate but not 6-sulfate group(s) on the penultimate Gal or GalNAc residue showed markedly lower acceptor activity for the present novel α-GalNAc T (see Table 2). Although the relationship between the novel α-GalNAc T and chondroitin and/or dermatan sulfate biosynthesis is unclear, the observed modulation of the enzyme activity by the sulfated substrates implies that the enzyme might play an important role in the regulation of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. Rohrmann et al.(21Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported that the β-GalNAc transferase (GalNAc T-I), which catalyzes the addition of a GalNAc to the linkage tetrasaccharide, is different from that (GalNAc T-II) which catalyzes the polymerization of a chondroitin sulfate chain. This conclusion was mainly based on the differential thermostability of the two activities, i.e. GalNAc T-I was quite thermostable while GalNAc T-II was not. Interestingly, the present novel α-GalNAc T, which catalyzed the addition of an α-GalNAc to the linkage tetrasaccharide and hexasaccharide serines, was also resistant to thermodenaturation (50°C for 60 min) as described under “Results,” while the serum β-GalNAc transferase(20Kitagawa H. Tsuchida K. Ujikawa M. Sugahara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which utilized polymeric chondroitin as an acceptor substrate, underwent rapid thermodenaturation. Thus, the thermostability and substrate specificities of these two enzymes, GalNAc T-I and α-GalNAc T, are very similar regardless of their allegedly different linkage specificities. The discrepancy between the two enzymes regarding anomeric linkage specificity remains to be demonstrated. Although the positional assignment of GalNAc attachment to the terminal GlcA was not accomplished in this study owing to the limited availability of authentic acceptor substrates, it seems likely that this novel enzyme may be an α1-4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. Very recently, Etchison et al.(24Etchison J.R. Srikrishna G. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 756-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that when several different cell lines were labeled with [3H]galactose in the presence of 4-methyl umbelliferyl β-D-xyloside (Xylβ4MU), a small portion of the labeled products contained the carbohydrate-protein linkage region of chondroitin sulfate terminating with an α-GalNAc residue instead of a typical β-GalNAc residue. Moreover, structural analysis of the labeled product by 3H NMR spectroscopy revealed that the GalNAc was linked to the non-reducing terminal GlcA residue in an α1-4 linkage(25Manzi A. Salimath P.V. Spiro R.C. Keifer P.A. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9154-9163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Presumably, the α-GalNAc T discovered in the present study catalyzes the formation of a product similar to that terminating with an α1-4-linked GalNAc unit in cultured cells. Indeed, the nonsulfated linkage tetrasaccharide serine served as an acceptor only for the α-GalNAc T, despite the presence of a chondro-oligosaccharide β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity in fetal bovine serum. In addition, it should be noted that when the tetrasaccharide serine was tested as an acceptor using the solubilized microsomal fraction from mouse mastocytoma, it served as an acceptor only for GalNAc transferase but not for GlcNAc transferase, accepting a GalNAc residue exclusively through an α-linkage.3 3K. Lidholt, M. Fjelstad, U. Lindahl, F. Goto, T. Ogawa, Y. Tanaka, K. Tsuchida, H. Kitagawa, and K. Sugahara, manuscript in preparation. The role, if any, of the α-GalNAc T in relation to glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis is unclear. The addition of an α-GalNAc unit to the tetrasaccharide core of the linkage region of proteoglycans may serve as a stop signal that precludes further chain elongation. On the other hand, it may be noted that 4-epimerization of the transferred α-GalNAc to an α-GlcNAc unit may provide a primer for heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthesis ((24Etchison J.R. Srikrishna G. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 756-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however, see the GlcNAc transfer to GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol described by Fritz et al.(26Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Purification, characterization, and molecular cloning of this transferase should reveal whether it participates in the formation of glycosaminoglycan chains"

H-NS has a general effect on transcription by compacting DNA; but for a number of specific genes, it is known to act directly as repressor or activator. The homodimeric protein binds to the major groove of DNA in a sequence-nonspecific manner, recognizing a curved conformation of the target DNA. H-NS consists of 136 amino acids with a single tryptophanyl residue at position 108. To overcome the apparent lack of any other structural details, we took advantage of the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp-108. Static and dynamic quenching constants obtained with the neutral quencher molecule acrylamide are consistent with a hydrophilic environment and high degree of solvent exposure for Trp-108. In addition, quenching studies in the presence of the anionic quencher iodide indicate a positively charged microenvironment for the same amino acid residue. Specific and nonspecific H-NS•DNA complexes were studied by gel retardation and fluorescence analysis. While specific H-NS•DNA complex formation is accompanied by a clear enhancement of the tryptophanyl fluorescence intensity, interaction in the presence of the nonspecific competitor DNA poly(dI-dC) decreases the fluorescence quantum yield.

In addition, the thermo-osmotic regulation of virulence gene expression in Shigella was shown to be influenced by H-NS(15Porter M. Dorman C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4187-4191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A common denominator for H-NS-dependent regulation of the unrelated group of genes appears to be certain extreme environmental conditions, i.e. cold shock, osmotic shock, or other kinds of stress situations. The constantly growing number of genes whose expression is known to be affected by H-NS includes the most efficiently expressed RNAs of the cell, namely ribosomal RNAs(16Wagner R. Arch.

The binding region extends from positions −18 to −89, relative to the P1 transcription start site, and shows an overlap with the known binding sites for Fis. Thus, in addition to the control of several other global regulatory networks, i.e. stringent or growth rate control, ribosomal RNA synthesis is linked to certain cellular stress conditions via H-NS-mediated repression(9Tippner D.

Due to a lack of detailed structural information on H-NS (for instance, three-dimensional crystallographic data or high resolution NMR spectroscopy), 1While this manuscript was in the reviewing process, a NMR study of a C-terminal 47-residue tryptic H-NS fragment was published by Shindo et al.(32Shindo H. Iwaki T. Ieda R. Kurumizaka H. Veguchi C. Mizuno T. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Kuboniwa H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which is fully compatible with the data presented here. we took advantage of the intrinsic fluorescence of a single tryptophanyl residue at position 108, which we used as a structural indicator. The microenvironment of the fluorophor was investigated by fluorescence quenching studies. Furthermore, steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed to analyze the protein conformation in the free and DNA-bound states. The specific interaction of H-NS with a curved rrnB P1 promoter fragment was followed by fluorescence measurements and compared with the nonspecific interaction of H-NS with the competitor DNA poly(dI-dC). These studies demonstrate that the single H-NS tryptophanyl residue at position 108 is strongly affected upon DNA binding. The fluorescence emission intensity is enhanced after binding to specific DNA target sites. In contrast, the interaction of H-NS with nonspecific DNA decreases the Trp-108 fluorescence. These data, in correlation with acrylamide and iodide quenching experiments, suggest that H-NS shows two different complex conformations dependent on binding to specific or nonspecific DNA sites and closely links Trp-108 to this conformational change. All common chemicals were of the highest purity and were purchased from Merck, Sigma, or Fluka. Ultrapure Tris was obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Suprapure KCl and KI were products from Merck and Janssen, respectively. The competitor DNA poly(dI-dC) was a product of Boehringer Mannheim. For convenience and to allow quantitative comparison of poly(dI-dC), which is rather heterogeneous in length, with DNA fragments of defined length, the concentrations of all nucleic acids are given in units of molar base pairs. Acrylamide was purchased in a twice recrystallized form from Serva. KCl, KI, and acrylamide solutions were dissolved in assay buffer at the pH that was appropriate for each experiment.

H-NS protein was isolated and purified from E. coli MRE 600 cells as described recently(9Tippner D. Afflerbach H. Wagner R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 589-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The purified protein was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. H-NS protein was homogeneous as judged by silver staining of polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic separations in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Protein concentrations were determined according to the Bradford microassay protocol (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and according to the known extinction coefficient ∈278 = 0.86 liter g-1 cm-1(22Spassky A. Buc H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Standard binding assays and gel retardation experiments were performed as described(9Tippner D. Afflerbach H. Wagner R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 589-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Binding conditions were precisely adapted to the ionic environment present during fluorescence spectroscopy. Routinely, samples were incubated for 20 min in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 94 nM bp of radioactively labeled rrnB P1 promoter fragment, 35 μM bp of competitor DNA poly(dI-dC), and 86 nM H-NS in a total volume of 10 μl. The samples were mixed with 2 μl of 50% glycerol in TBE buffer(23Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Gel electrophoretic dissection of free and bound DNAs was performed for 4 h at 250 V with native 5% polyacrylamide gels (46:1). Dried gels were autoradiographed for 12 h at −20°C. The amounts of free and bound DNAs were determined by densitometric evaluation of unsaturated autoradiograms using a Zeineh SL-504-XL soft laser scanning densitometer and the software “Scan-Plot.” 3D. Tippner, unpublished data. All steady-state intrinsic fluorescence measurements of H-NS were made with an SLM 8000 photon-counting spectrofluorometer with a xenon arc lamp. A constant sample measurement temperature of 21°C was maintained by a Julabo F20 circulating temperature bath. The excitation and emission slit widths were 8 and 4 nm, respectively. All emission spectra were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 282 nm to obtain maximum intrinsic H-NS tryptophan fluorescence. Emission spectra were recorded at wavelengths between 300 and 400 nm with 1-nm steps. Each data point of the spectra was the sum of detected and counted photons in a time interval of 10 s. All measurements were corrected for dilution, and emission from the control was considered by recording subtraction spectra between sample and control probes. Since absorbance values did not exceed 0.01, corrections due to inner filter effects were not incorporated. In the case of protein•DNA complexes, where this value was exceeded, relative measurements as described below were performed, making corrections unnecessary. All quenching experiments were made as steady-state acrylamide and KI quenching procedures at 21°C. 86 nM H-NS protein in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was quenched in the presence of increasing amounts of acrylamide (25-200 mM) or KI (10-50 mM). The fluorescence measurements were performed as described above, as continuous emission spectra between 300 and 400 nm, or as fixed point measurements with emission recordings at 337 nm. The excitation wavelength was 282 nm. The classical Stern-Volmer equation relates the drop in fluorescence to the concentration of a collisional quencher as shown in : F0F=1+Ksv[Q](Eq. 1) where F0 is the fluorescence in the absence and F is the fluorescence in the presence of the quencher (Q). KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant for the collisional quenching process(24Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). According to the fluorescence quenching data obtained from acrylamide quenching, the following modified Stern-Volmer equation was used to estimate the relevant quenching constants: F0F=(1+Ksv[Q]ev[Q](Eq. 2) where now KSV is the dynamic quenching constant and V is the additional static quenching constant (24Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). To determine KSV and V, the collected data were fitted to using the nonlinear least-squares program “FITLS32.” 4FITLS32 is available via anonymous ftp from the server tui.cri.nz in the directory/pub/gle/gle32. Fluorescence measurements were performed under conditions in which specific binding of H-NS to the upstream sequence of the rrnB P1 promoter fragment had been demonstrated by footprint analysis(9Tippner D. Afflerbach H. Wagner R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 589-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the presence of 35 μM bp of poly(dI-dC) as competitor DNA, varying amounts of rrnB P1 promoter fragment (0, 47.3, 94.6, 141.9, 189.2, 236.5, and 283.8 nM bp) were incubated in a total volume of 800 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 86 nM H-NS. In contrast, nonspecific DNA interactions were investigated by replacing the specific rrnB promoter fragment with the corresponding identical amounts of poly(dI-dC). Fluorescence emission measurements were performed and corrected for control samples in the absence of protein as indicated above. The small neutral protein H-NS contains a single tryptophanyl residue at position 108. This offers a convenient way for a possible conformational analysis of the protein by measuring the intrinsic tryptophanyl fluorescence. The fluorescence intensities of H-NS, recorded between 300 and 400 nm, yield a typical emission spectrum of a tryptophan-containing protein when excited at 282 nm (see insets in Figure 1:, Figure 2:). The emission peak is broad with a maximum in the range of 337-340 nm and shows a somewhat slower decay at higher wavelengths than the increase in fluorescence intensity at shorter wavelengths.Figure 2:Stern-Volmer plot of the iodide quenching of H-NS fluorescence emission in the presence of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mM KI ([trio). The inset shows complete H-NS fluorescence emission spectra in the presence of 0 and 50 mM KI recorded between 300 and 400 nm. To obtain a maximum of graphical clearness, fluorescence emission spectra at 337 nm with different KI concentrations (indicated above) are shown as crossed circles. λex = 282 nm, 21°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The influence of the effective fluorescence quencher molecules acrylamide and iodide on the tryptophanyl fluorescence of H-NS is shown in Figure 1:, Figure 2: respectively. Both acrylamide and KI quench the fluorescence intensity of H-NS without significant spectral shift, but in a different manner. The Stern-Volmer plots of the collected acrylamide and iodide quenching data of H-NS show opposite tendencies: the Stern-Volmer plot of H-NS in the presence of acrylamide follows an upward curved exponential function, which can be fitted according to. The acrylamide quenching data yield apparent static and dynamic quenching constants of V = 4.3 M-1 and KSV = 11.7 M-1, respectively. In contrast, the ratio F0/F of the H-NS I- quenching experiments exhibits a downward curved exponential saturation as shown in Fig. 2. It can be described with an exponential function such that F0/F = a − (a − 1)•e-x. The downward curvature of such a dependence in quenching experiments can be explained with the hypothesis that a net positive charge exists in the microenvironment of the tryptophanyl residue, for example, due to protonation of nearby amino acid side chains. After saturation of this positive charge with increasing amounts of iodide anions, following quenching, interactions with the fluorophor can only occur in a weaker manner(24Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). As we shall see, the notion of a positively charged microenvironment of Trp-108 is essential for the considerations below. Detailed analyses of H-NS•DNA complexes have revealed that specific H-NS binding requires a strong DNA curvature, usually provided by a defined number of appropriately spaced AT clusters(9Tippner D. Afflerbach H. Wagner R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 589-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Ito K. Oshima T. Mizuno T. Nakamura Y. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6578-6588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such specific binding had been shown, for example, to the upstream sequences of ribosomal RNA P1 promoters (UAS region). However, the protein has also a low affinity for random DNA sequences, and nonspecific binding is known to occur to synthetic polynucleotides, such as poly(dI-dC), which is widely used as a competitor DNA in binding studies. For analysis of specific binding, e.g. footprinting studies, stringent binding conditions suppressing nonspecific interactions have been elaborated. Stringent binding conditions imply the simultaneous presence of specific target DNA and an excess of nonspecific competitor(9Tippner D. Afflerbach H. Wagner R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 589-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The binding constant for H-NS and the P1 fragment measured according to Fried (25Fried G.M. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) has been determined as 3.8 × 106M-1 under standard binding conditions. This number differs by a factor of 100 compared with the Kb for poly(dI-dC), assuming a single binding site for the specific fragment and a number of binding sites corresponding to the concentration of molar base pairs of the nonspecific DNA. Fig. 3 shows the interaction of H-NS with the P1 promoter UAS fragment as a function of the addition of increasing amounts of nonspecific competitor DNA poly(dI-dC). Binding was followed by gel mobility shift analysis. With increasing amounts of poly(dI-dC), a loss of specific H-NS•P1 complex formation can be observed (Fig. 3 H-NSsp, lanes 1-10). A second band representing complexes with lower gel mobility is visible in lane 1, to which no competitor DNA was added. Obviously, the second complex was formed due to additional nonspecific interactions of H-NS with the rrnB P1 promoter fragment. To study possible protein conformational changes related to the binding of H-NS to specific DNA sites, fluorescence analysis of H-NS•rrnB P1 promoter complexes was performed. As outlined above, specific binding of H-NS to the P1 promoter fragment, as for footprint analysis, was routinely performed in the presence of high concentrations of competitor DNA. We attempted to maintain the same conditions for the fluorescence measurements. Reactions were designed to compare the effect on fluorescence emission when, in the presence of competitor DNA, H-NS samples were titrated with either increasing amounts of specific binding P1 promoter fragment or nonspecific competitor DNA poly(dI-dC). We sought to determine if the environment of Trp-108 would be affected differently under conditions of specific or nonspecific interaction. The results of such experiments are exemplified in Figure 4:, Figure 5: where H-NS was titrated with increasing amounts of poly(dI-dC) or rrnB P1 fragment, respectively. From these samples, the H-NS fluorescence emission spectra were recorded. All samples had a constant amount of competitor DNA poly(dI-dC) (35 μM bp), but contained different amounts of specific rrnB P1 DNA (0-189.2 nM bp; Fig. 4) or additional poly(dI-dC) at the same concentrations (Fig. 5). In each case, there was a change in fluorescence intensity at 340 nm. Thus, the fluorescence intensity at this wavelength was suitable to monitor conformational differences upon the addition of specific or nonspecific DNA to H-NS complexes.Figure 5:Fluorescence emission spectra of H-NS in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in the presence of a constant 35 μM bp of competitor DNA poly(dI-dC) and different amounts of additional poly(dI-dC) DNA at the same concentrations as the P1 UAS fragment shown in Fig. 4. Protein concentration was 86 nM. λex = 282 nm, 21°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A typical H-NS fluorescence emission spectrum between 300 and 400 nm can be recorded when the control samples without the P1 fragment or additional poly(dI-dC) are excited at 282 nm. The addition of the specific binding P1 UAS fragment results in a clear increase in fluorescence intensity, indicative of a change in the environment of the fluorophor, caused either by an alteration of the protein conformation or by the close proximity of the DNA (Fig. 4). In contrast, the addition of nonspecific DNA under the same conditions leads to a decrease in the tryptophanyl fluorescence emission intensity (Fig. 5). Thus, the Trp-108 environment of H-NS after complex formation with specific or nonspecific DNA is different, indicating conformational differences in H-NS or differently arranged complex topographies.

Although being surmised to be the place for the functional role of GSL, the plasma membrane is not the site of their metabolism. Rather, GSL are synthesized in the Golgi complex by sequential addition of monosaccharide units to ceramide and are degraded in lysosomes by the sequential removal of glycosyl residues starting from the nonreducing end. Thus, the maintenance of a balanced glycolipid profile requires a stringent control of metabolism and transport of GSL (for review see (3van Meer G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 247-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and (4Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10865-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)).We have observed labeled and cell-specific glycosylation products when a radioactive or fluorescent analog of glucosylceramide had been administered to cultured cells. These products (analogs of globosides and gangliosides) could have been formed in the Golgi complex by direct glycosylation of the labeled glucosylceramide analogs or from the labeled ceramide analogs; the latter resulting from deglucosylation, most likely in lysosomes, of the former. Therefore, we have studied the metabolism of glucosylceramide analogs that contain sulfur in the glycosidic bond (Fig. 1) and are thus resistant to enzymatic deglucosylation. We will present data showing unambiguously that a direct glycosylation of these analogs of glucosylceramide takes place in various cultured cells leading to a cell-specific pattern of labeled glycolipid analogs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsSHSY5Y cells were kindly provided by Dr. H.

The resulting clear solution was diluted with 9 ml of DMEM to yield a 10 μM lipid-BSA complex.Cell CultureMonolayer cultures of human skin fibroblasts obtained from biopsy of a male infant and rat neuroblastoma cells B 104 were cultured as described(11Weitz G. Lindl T. Hinrichs U. Sandhoff K. Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Human neuroblastoma-derived SHSY5Y cells were grown as described(12Rebhan M. Vacun G. Bayreuther K. Rösner H. NeuroReport. 1994; 5: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All cells were grown at 37°C in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cultures were seeded with 7 × 105 fibroblasts or B 104 in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks. The cultures were then grown for 1 to 2 days. For human neuroblastoma cultures, 105 SHSY5Y cells were seeded and grown for 4 days prior to use. Murine cerebellar cells were prepared essentially as described (13Trenkner E. Sidman R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 915-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and were plated onto poly(L-lysine)-coated 35-mm-diameter Petri dishes (5 × 106 cells/dish) and cultured for 4 days as described(14van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Incubation of Cells with Radioactive or Fluorescent Glucosylthioceramide for Biochemical StudiesCells were washed in DMEM and incubated with the [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer•BSA complex (10 μM) or the NBD-C8-Glc-S-Cer•BSA complex (10 μM) in DMEM for 2 h at 37°C, washed with DMEM, and further incubated for 20 h at 37°C in DMEM containing 0.3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum or heat-inactivated horse serum in the case of murine cerebellar cells. For inactivation, the sera were heated for 30 min at 56°C. In cases where monensin was used, this drug was present at a 1 μM concentration at all times of incubation. The incubation media were saved, and the cells were washed with PBS, harvested with a rubber policeman, and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. For protein determination(15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar), the pellet was suspended in 0.4 ml of H2O, and aliquots of 5 μl were assayed. The lipids were extracted with 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, by volume) for 3 h at 38°C. The lipid extracts and the media were desalted according to (16Williams M. McCluer R. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Total fluorescent lipids of cell extracts and media were determined by measurements of their relative fluorescence compared to a fluorescent standard containing a known amount of NBD-lipid. All measurements were made in chloroform/methanol (1:1, by volume) on a Shimadzu RF 5000 spectrophotofluorometer (λex = 475 nm; λem = 530 nm) (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany). Total radioactive lipids of both cells and media were determined by liquid scintillation counting of aliquots. The combined lipid extracts of cells and media were analyzed by TLC using chloroform/methanol/15 mM calcium chloride (60:35:8, by volume) as the developing solvent. Individual NBD-lipids separated by TLC were determined with a TLC fluorescence scanner Shimadzu CS-910 with on-line integrator C-R4A; measurements were done in the reflection mode (λex = 475 nm; λem = 530 nm). Individual radioactive lipids were determined using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bio Imaging analyzer (Raytest, Pforzheim, Germany). In addition, TLC plates were exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat XAR-5) and photographed on Polaroid film (type 667) under UV light for radioactive and fluorescent lipids, respectively.Oxidation of Glucosylthioceramide Analogs to the Sulfoxides and Reduction to Starting MaterialsThe material of the thick band just below [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer (confer to x1 of Fig. 2and Fig. 4) was isolated from TLC plates and quantified. For the reduction with trimethylsilyl iodide according to (17Olah G.A. Narang S.C. Gupta B.G.B. Malhotra R. Synthesis. 1979; 1979: 61-62Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the material (about 10 nmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile and mixed with 15 nmol of trimethylsilyl chloride and 30 nmol of sodium iodide. The mixture was stirred at room temperature under argon for 20 min. TLC analysis (Fig. 6) showed that this material could be reduced to [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer again and therefore represented the corresponding sulfoxide. Further proof was obtained as follows: NBD-C8-Glc-S-Cer and [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer were oxidized as described for sulfur compounds (18Hinsberg O. Ber. 1908; 41: 2836-2839Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 200 nmol of the thiolipids were oxidized overnight at 38°C in 120 μl of 0.1 M methanolic hydrogen peroxide. The oxidized products were characterized by TLC (Fig. 6) and FAB-MS.Figure 2:Postendocytotic glycosylation of [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer in various cell types. Human skin fibroblasts, rat neuroblastoma B 104, human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y, and murine cerebellar cells were incubated with [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In cases where monensin was used, this drug was present in a 1 μM concentration at all times of incubation.

The radioactive analog of globotriaosylceramide from fibroblast extract was characterized by FAB-MS and identified by its degradation to the radioactive analog of lactosylceramide using α-galactosidase(6Dean K.J. Sweely C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9994-10000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GM3 and LacCer analogs of B 104 cell extracts were characterized by FAB-MS. Other glycolipid analogs of total lipid extracts were degraded by two subsequent actions of glycohydrolases (fibroblasts: β-hexosaminidases and α-galactosidase, SHSY5Y cells: β-hexosaminidases and sialidase, and murine cerebellar cells: sialidase and GM1-β-galactosidase) as outlined in Fig. 4. Briefly, extracted lipids were dissolved in a total volume of 330 μl of 85 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.3, containing 2 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate in addition to the respective enzymes. For β-hexosaminidases, sialidase, or α- and β-galactosidase, 17,000, 1,300, 185, or 17 picokatals, respectively, were used. To assays containing β-hexosaminidases GM2 activator protein (1 unit according to (19Conzelmann E. Burg J. Stephan G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)) was also added. After 10 h at 37°C, each assay was split and one-half was treated further with the second enzyme as outlined in Fig. 4. The lipid extract of B 104 cells was treated with sialidase as described above for murine cerebellar cells.Testing of the Incubation Media for Glycosyltransferase ActivitiesIn a total assay volume of 100 μl of DMEM, pH 7.4, containing 50 nmol each of CMP-NeuAc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GalNAc, as well as 6 μl of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum or horse serum, 5 nmol of [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer was incubated for 22 h at 37°C. After the addition of methanol (50 μl), salts and nucleotide sugars were removed according to (16Williams M. McCluer R. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The lipids were analyzed by TLC (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Glycosylation products of [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer in fibroblast pellets and incubation media. Human skin fibroblasts were incubated with [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer as for Fig. 2. The lipids of cells and media were desalted and separated by TLC as for Fig. 2. To test for any glycosyltransferase activity in the incubation media, these media were incubated in the presence of [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer and nucleotide sugars as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The radioactive lipids were visualized by exposure to x-ray-sensitive film.

Peter-Katalinic J. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1987; 6: 331-393Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar) using a ZAB HF instrument (VG Analytical, Manchester, UK). Protein was quantified as described (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) using BSA as standard.RESULTSUptake of Labeled Glucosylthioceramides by Cultured CellsWe first examined the uptake of [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer and NBD-C8-Glc-S-Cer using equal concentrations of radioactive lipid•BSA and fluorescent lipid•BSA complexes. All cell types were incubated for 2 h at 37°C with a 10 μM concentration of either complex, washed, and further incubated for 20 h in DMEM devoid of the labeled lipid•BSA complexes, but containing 0.3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum or heat-inactivated horse serum in the case of murine cerebellar cells. During the 20-h incubation, some protein(s) of the sera extracted a considerable percentage of the glucosylthioceramide analogs and their metabolites from the plasma membrane of cells. Therefore, the labeled lipids were isolated from the incubation media, quantified, and combined with the lipid extract of the corresponding cells. The amount of cell-associated radiolabeled and fluorescent lipids is shown in Table 1. Except for fibroblasts, similar values were obtained for both labeled lipids demonstrating that the fluorescent label had no drastic influence on the uptake rate. There was, however, a much higher percentage of fluorescent glycolipids than radioactive glycolipids that were extracted into the incubation medium. During the 20-h incubation, roughly 25% and 50% of the radiocarbon and fluorescent-labeled lipids, respectively, were extracted from the various cells.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Glycosylation of Radioactive GlucosylthioceramideWe next examined the possible metabolism of the radioactive glucosylceramide analog in four different cell types. Fig. 2shows that each cell type displayed a different glycosylation pattern. From comparison of the product bands to labeled glycolipid analogs with similar structures (reference lane) and from metabolic labeling of the endogenous glycolipid pattern of each cell type, it became immediately obvious that the undegradable radioactive glucosylceramide analog had been glycosylated to yield a cell-type specific pattern of glycolipid analogs. Thus, in fibroblasts, obviously those of globosides and GM3 were predominantly formed (Fig. 2, lane 2). In rat neuroblastoma B 104 cells, high amounts of the analog of GM3 and smaller amounts of lactosylceramide were produced (Fig. 2, lane 4), whereas in murine cerebellar cells, labeled ganglioside analogs of GM3, GD3, GM2, GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b were present (Fig. 2, lane 8). These data agreed perfectly with the endogenous pattern obtained by metabolic labeling of the glycolipids of these cells(14van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells, the analogs of GM2 and GD2 were the prevalent glycosylation products formed (Fig. 2, lane 6). This result again complies with the endogenous glycolipid pattern(12Rebhan M. Vacun G. Bayreuther K. Rösner H. NeuroReport. 1994; 5: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We could also observe that the glycosylation products found in the incubation media were the same as those found in the respective cell pellets. This is demonstrated for fibroblasts in Fig. 3(lanes 3 and 4). These patterns comply well with that of Fig. 2(lane 2). In addition, we have shown that the incubation media containing 0.3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum were devoid of any detectable glycosyltransferase activity (Fig. 3, lane 2). The same holds for heat-inactivated horse serum (data not shown).Identification of Glycosylation ProductsThe structures of some glycosylation products, i.e. globotriaosylceramide analog from fibroblasts and lactosylceramide, as well as GM3 analogs from rat neuroblastoma B 104 cells, have been confirmed by FAB-MS. The structures of the other glycolipid analogs have been corroborated by sequential enzymatic degradation (Fig. 4). Thus, treatment of the glycosylation products of SHSY5Y cells with hexosaminidases resulted in a shift in both main bands to bands of analogs of GD3 and GM3 (Fig. 4, lane 6). Subsequent sialidase treatment further shifted these bands to labeled lactosylceramide analog with the same property as an authentic synthesized lactosylceramide analog (reference lane), whereas the GM1 analog remained undegraded (Fig. 4, lane 7). Similarly, sialidase treatment of glycosylation products of murine cerebellar cells led to an increase in the analogs of GM1 and lactosylceramide (Fig. 4, lane 8) which on subsequent β-galactosidase treatment were converted mostly to the GM2 analog and glucosylthioceramide, respectively (Fig. 4, lane 9). When human fibroblasts were treated with hexosaminidases, the bands of GM3 and globotriaosylceramide analogs remained, whereas the bands of GM2 and globotetraosylceramide analogs diminished (Fig. 4, lane 2). Subsequent hydrolysis with α-galactosidase (Fig. 4, lane 3) converted the latter only slightly into the corresponding lactosylceramide. Therefore, the putative globotriaosylceramide analog was isolated from the TLC plate and treated with α-galactosidase again. Fig. 5demonstrates that about 50% of this lipid was hydrolyzed to lactosylceramide analog, confirming the data obtained by FAB-MS. Sialidase treatment of the lipid extract of B 104 cells diminished the analog of GM3 while increasing the corresponding lactosylceramide. These results proved the structures of the glycosylation products of [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer.Figure 5:Hydrolysis of radioactive globotriaosylceramide analog with α-galactosidase.

After isolation from the TLC plate, its structure was shown by FAB-MS to be the oxidation product, i.e. the sulfoxide of [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer. When treated with trimethylsilyl iodide according to (17Olah G.A. Narang S.C. Gupta B.G.B. Malhotra R. Synthesis. 1979; 1979: 61-62Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the sulfoxide was reduced to [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer (Fig. 6, lane 3). This sulfoxide could also be obtained by treating glucosylthioceramide with methanolic hydrogen peroxide. Under this condition, the corresponding sulfone is also produced. Both products could be separated by TLC (Fig. 6, lane 4 and 5), and their structure proven by FAB-MS. The faint bands seen between [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer and its sulfoxide in Fig. 4(denoted by y in lanes 6 and 7) may well represent this sulfone. The sulfoxide of [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer also seems to be prone to glycosylation as most clearly demonstrated by the prominent band just below the GM3 analog for the B 104 cell extract (denoted by x4 in Fig. 2, lane 4).Effect of Monensin on the Glycosylation of [14C]C8-Glc-S-CerThe fact that [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer, after incorporation into various cells, became glycosylated to yield a cell-type specific pattern of glycolipid analogs strongly suggested that this exogenous glucosylthioceramide enters the glycolipid biosynthetic pathway exactly as for endogenous glucosylceramide. To further substantiate this notion, we have examined the effect of the ionophore monensin on the glycosylation pattern of [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer. It has been shown before that this drug impedes vesicular membrane flow between the proximal and distal regions of the Golgi apparatus(21Kääriänen L. Hashimoto K. Saraste J. Virtanen I. Penttinen K. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), thus dissecting early and late glycosylation steps in glycolipid biosynthesis(14van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Miller-Prodraza H. Fishman P.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 804: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indeed, when the incorporation and incubation was performed in the presence of monensin a drastic simplification of the labeled lipid pattern was observed (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 7, and 9). The complex glycolipids in contrast to GM3, GD3, and lactosylceramide analogs were highly reduced.Glycosylation of Fluorescent GlucosylthioceramideWhen cells were treated with NBD-C8-Glc-S-Cer the degree of its glycosylation was much less than that for [14C]C8-Glc-S-Cer (Table 2). The patterns of the fluorescent glycosylation products that were found in the cell pellets and the respective incubation media were, however, almost the same as for the radioactive ones. In fibroblasts, however, more fluorescent GM3 than globotriaosylceramide analog was synthesized (Fig. 7, lane 2). Again, in the presence of monensin, the patterns were changed. This is best to be observed for SHSY5Y cells (Fig. 7, lanes 6 and 7) and murine cerebellar cells (Fig. 7, lanes 8 and 9). For both cell types, no fluorescent ganglioside analogs but for GM3 were produced in detectable amounts in the presence of this drug.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 7:Postendocytotic glycosylation of NBD-C8-Glc-S-Cer in various cell types.

In human fibroblasts, rat neuroblastoma B 104 cells, and murine cerebellar cells, the glycosylation pattern obtained was identical with the pattern that is obtained by metabolic labeling of these cells(14van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells also yielded a glycosylation pattern which completely agreed with the endogenous glycolipid pattern(12Rebhan M. Vacun G. Bayreuther K. Rösner H. NeuroReport. 1994; 5: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The amount of the fluorescent glycosylation products was, however, much less than that of the radioactive anabolites (Table 2) indicating that the fluorescent tag somehow interferes with glycosylation and/or transport. This is most obvious for fibroblasts when comparing the patterns of labeled analogs showing that more fluorescent GM3 than fluorescent globotriaosylceramide was formed (compare Fig. 7, lane 2, to Fig. 2, lane 2). In contrast, more of the radioactive analog of globotriaosylceramide than that of GM3 was synthesized, thus exactly mimicking the endogenous glycolipid pattern. The NBD group may render the fluorescent analogs more polar. This may explain the high degree of fluorescent lipids extracted into the incubation medium and may also explain why less fluorescent than radioactive glycosylation products have been produced.Owing to the hydrophilic glucosyl head group, no spontaneous diffusion across the plasma membrane can occur, and the internalization of the labeled analogs at 37°C very likely takes place by vesicular membrane flow. Hence we have to assume that vesicles carrying these glucosylceramide analogs eventually fuse with Golgi cisternae (or other compartments active in glycosylation) that contain the enzymes for lactosylceramide, GM3, and GD3 synthesis. We do not yet know from where these vesicles are derived and if endosomes and/or lysosomes are intermediate stations in this transport. It has been shown clearly, however, that these glucosylceramide derivatives participate in the biosynthetic pathway of the respective cell-specific glycosphingolipids.For glycosphingolipids, the Golgi apparatus is the well accepted site for their biosynthesis. It is believed that lactosylceramide and gangliosides GM3 and GD3 are synthesized presumably in proximal Golgi cisternae, and that the more complex glycosphingolipids are synthesized in distal Golgi membranes(23Trinchera M. Ghidoni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15766-15769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane flow from proximal to distal Golgi membranes is inhibited by monensin (for review, see (24Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar)). Thus, from our experiments with monensin, we infer that the glucosylthioceramides were conveyed to Golgi cisternae that function in the early glycosylation steps in glycolipid biosynthesis, i.e. the formation of lactosylceramide and gangliosides GM3 and GD3. The formation of analogs of lactosylceramide and GM3 was not impaired by monensin whereas the production of the complex glycosylation products was severely decreased.Our findings lend support to observations made by others who found indication for a glycosylation of glucosylceramide in cultured fibroblasts derived from patients with Gaucher disease(25Saito M. Rosenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2295-2300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has to be kept in mind, however, that these fibroblasts may contain enough residual glucocerebrosidase activity (26van Weely S. van Leeuwen M.B. Jansen I.D.C. de Bruijn M.A.C. Brouwer-Kelder E.M. Schram A.W. Miranda M.C.S. Barranger J.A. Petersen E.M. Goldblatt J. Stotz H. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Svennerholm L. Erikson A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1096: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to degrade an appreciable amount of the exogenously supplied glucosylceramide and that its labeled degradation product may have been used for de novo synthesis of glucosylceramide and more complex glycolipids. Also, the mode of uptake of the exogenously supplied glucosylceramide via liposomes may have directed this lipid to cellular compartments active in another nonlysosomal glucocerebrosidase that is not deficient in Gaucher disease (27van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys.

If so, would this have implications in terms of regulation of glycolipid biosynthesis? To address this question, we intend to perform studies employing undegradable analogs of glucosylceramide and other glycosphingolipids carrying long acyl chains in their ceramide portion. Even if the short chain glucosylceramide analogs should not mimic the endocytotic pathway of the endogenous glycolipids, they are valuable tools for revealing membrane transport that otherwise may be overlooked and that may be important for cellular events. Further experiments are needed to clarify this point.

Although being surmised to be the place for the functional role of GSL, the plasma membrane is not the site of their metabolism. Rather, GSL are synthesized in the Golgi complex by sequential addition of monosaccharide units to ceramide and are degraded in lysosomes by the sequential removal of glycosyl residues starting from the nonreducing end. Thus, the maintenance of a balanced glycolipid profile requires a stringent control of metabolism and transport of GSL (for review see (3van Meer G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 247-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and (4Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10865-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)).We have observed labeled and cell-specific glycosylation products when a radioactive or fluorescent analog of glucosylceramide had been administered to cultured cells. These products (analogs of globosides and gangliosides) could have been formed in the Golgi complex by direct glycosylation of the labeled glucosylceramide analogs or from the labeled ceramide analogs; the latter resulting from deglucosylation, most likely in lysosomes, of the former. Therefore, we have studied the metabolism of glucosylceramide analogs that contain sulfur in the glycosidic bond (Fig. 1) and are thus resistant to enzymatic deglucosylation. We will present data showing unambiguously that a direct glycosylation of these analogs of glucosylceramide takes place in various cultured cells leading to a cell-specific pattern of labeled glycolipid analogs."

Import of radiolabeled trfd is inhibited equally efficiently by nonlabeled trfd as well as by the intact precursor of ferredoxin. This strongly suggests that trfd enters the general import pathway of proteins into chloroplasts. trfd import was stimulated by ATP, which is the first demonstration that ATP is involved in membrane translocation of a targeting signal. Imported trfd was membrane-associated but was also partially degraded by internal proteases, most likely present in the stroma, indicating that the membrane-associated fraction of trfd is en route to its functional localization. The degradation products are exported out of the organelle. In contrast to the import of the precursor of ferredoxin, the import of trfd was independent of protease-sensitive components on the chloroplast surface, indicating that the initial binding of precursor proteins may be facilitated by transit sequence-lipid interactions.

The majority of the chloroplastic proteins is encoded on the nuclear DNA and synthesized in the cytosol. These proteins contain an N-terminal extension(1Dobberstein B. Blobel G. Chua N.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1082-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the transit sequence that is necessary(2Reis B. Wasman C.C. Bohnert H.J. Mol. & Gen.

Acta. 1991; 1071: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)). The import process is initiated by binding of precursor proteins to the chloroplast surface(6Pfisterer J. Lachmann P. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Maximal binding requires the utilization of low amounts of ATP (100 μM) in the intermembrane space (7Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6724-6729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the presence of protease-sensitive components on the chloroplast surface(8Cornwell K.L. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1987; 85: 780-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding can also be observed in the absence of ATP (9Flügge U.I. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 769-787PubMed Google Scholar) and after protease treatment of chloroplasts(10Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Lubben T.H. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3691-3696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that different binding stages and modes can exist. The subsequent translocation of the precursor proteins across the chloroplast envelope membranes requires a 1 mM ATP concentration (11Theg S.M. Bauerle C. Olsen L.J. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol.

Analysis of transit sequences reveals that there is little similarity in amino acid sequences(15Von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). They are enriched in hydroxylated and small hydrophobic amino acids, have a positive charge, and lack acidic amino acids(16Schmidt G.W. Mishkind M.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 879-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Keegstra K. Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 471-502Crossref Google Scholar). Despite the poor homology in the primary structure of transit sequences(15Von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar), they are able to perform their essential and specific functions in protein import processes (i.e. organelle-specific targeting, translocation across the envelope membranes, correct processing, and intraorganellar routing of precursor proteins). This can be illustrated with the precursor of ferredoxin (prefd), 1The abbreviations used are: prefdprecursor protein of ferredoxinapofdapoprotein of ferredoxinHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographytrfdtransit peptide of ferredoxinDTTdithiothreitolTCAtrichloroacetic acidPAGEpolyacryamide gel electrophoresisTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. which follows the general import pathway(18Huisman J.G. Moorman A.F.M. Verkleij F.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 82: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). prefd is imported into the chloroplast stroma, where it is subsequently processed(11Theg S.M. Bauerle C. Olsen L.J. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6730-6736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Smeekens S. Bauerle C. Hageman J. Keegstra K. Weisbeek P. Cell. 1986; 46: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The apoprotein is converted into the biologically active holoprotein by insertion of the 2Fe-2S cofactor(20Li H. Theg S.M. Bauerle C. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6748-6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Import of the largely unfolded prefd is independent of cytosolic factors(21Pilon M. De Kruijff B. Weisbeek P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2548-2556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that prefd itself contains all of the information for organelle-specific targeting and for the productive interaction with the import machinery leading to the translocation across the envelope membranes. Both processes require the presence of a functional transit sequence, because mature proteins do not bind to chloroplasts (22Friedman A.L. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 993-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and attachment of the ferredoxin transit sequence is sufficient to direct a foreign protein to the chloroplast stroma (23Smeekens S. Van Steeg H. Bauerle C. Bettenbroek H. Keegstra K. Weisbeek P.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 9: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The prefd transit sequence is also required for the interaction with the stromal processing enzyme, because deletions in the C-terminal region of the transit sequence strongly interfere with correct maturation of prefd(24Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. De Swaaf M. Talboom I. van't Hof R. De Korte-Kool C. Demel R.A. Weisbeek P.J. De Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3882-3893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Very recently, it was demonstrated that prefd causes a transit sequence-dependent reduction in electrochemical resistance of the envelope in intact chloroplasts. The most likely interpretation of this phenomenon was that the transit sequence opens protein-conducting channels(25Bulychev A. Pilon M. Dassen H. van't Hof R. Vredenberg W. De Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 204-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). How transit sequences function is completely unknown. However, it can be anticipated that they will exert specific interactions with components of the envelope membranes such as proteinaceous receptors (5De Boer A.D. Weisbeek P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and envelope membrane lipids(26van't Hof R. Van Klompenburg W. Pilon M. Kozubek A. De Korte-Kool G. Demel R.A. Weisbeek P.J.

In order to get insight into the way transit sequences function, we studied the import of the transit peptide of ferredoxin (trfd) into chloroplasts. It is shown that trfd follows the ATP-dependent import pathway as is used by prefd. Import of trfd was independent of protease-sensitive components on the chloroplast surface. Imported trfd is rapidly degraded by internal chloroplast proteases followed by an efficient export of the degradation products. Dithiothreitol (DTT) and glutathione were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Sorbitol, Hepes, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Percoll and chromatographic equipment and materials were from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Iodoacetamide was from Fluka (Buchs SG, Switzerland). All other chemicals were of the highest quality available. apofd was prepared out of holoprotein of ferredoxin as described(27Pilon M. Rietveld A.G. Weisbeek P.J. De Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19907-19913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). apofd was stored in aliquots in 150 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml under nitrogen at −20°C. prefd from Silene pratensis was purified as described by Pilon et al.(28Pilon M. De Boer A.D. Knols S.L. Koppelman M.H.G.M. Van der Graaf R.M. De Kruijff B. Weisbeek P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3358-3361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was stored in aliquots at a concentration ranging between 1 and 1.5 mg/ml in 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 8 M urea, and 0.02% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol under nitrogen at −20°C. [3H]prefd was obtained by growing Escherichia coli BL21 cells (DE3) containing the vector pET11d in 35 ml of SV medium (containing per liter 28 g of ammonium ferrosulfate, 0.2 g of magnesium sulfate, 8 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and 30 g sodium hydrogen phosphate with a pH of 6.9) at 37°C with the following additions: 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 5 mg/liter thiamin, and 50 mg/liter ampicillin until the optical density was 0.6. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 5 ml of SV medium with 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 5 mg/liter thiamin, 50 mg/liter ampicillin, and 1 mM isopropyl-1-β-D-galactopyranoside. After 30 min, 1.0 mCi of [3H]leucine (158 mCi/mmol) (Amersham Corp.) was added, and the cells were allowed to grow for another 3 h. prefd was purified as described(28Pilon M. De Boer A.D. Knols S.L. Koppelman M.H.G.M. Van der Graaf R.M. De Kruijff B. Weisbeek P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3358-3361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the cells were lysed by sonication (Branson) and a smaller gel filtration column (1.5 × 40 cm) was used. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as reference. A 47-mer corresponding to the transit sequence of ferredoxin from S. pratensis was synthesized on an Exell Pepsynthesizer by Millipore (Watford, UK). trfd with the sequence ASTLSTLSVSASLLPKQQPMVASSLPTNMGQALFGLKAGSRGRVTAM differs only from the sequence deduced from the gene (30Smeekens S. Van Binsbergen J. Weisbeek P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3179-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) by the absence of the N-terminal methionine, which is post-translationally removed in the cytosol and was blocked at the C terminus with an amide group to avoid the negative charge at this position. trfd was purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described(26van't Hof R. Van Klompenburg W. Pilon M. Kozubek A. De Korte-Kool G. Demel R.A. Weisbeek P.J. De Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4037-4042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the peptide was estimated to be over 98%, as determined by analytical HPLC. The identity of trfd was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of 20 amino acids by Edman degradation as described (28Pilon M. De Boer A.D. Knols S.L. Koppelman M.H.G.M. Van der Graaf R.M. De Kruijff B. Weisbeek P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3358-3361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by quantitative amino acid analysis. Peptide concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as reference. Purified trfd was labeled by reductive methylation using [14C]formaldehyde(31Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4359-4365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, 2 mg of trfd (0.47 μmol) dissolved in 500 μl of distilled water was added to 500 μl of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, containing 62.5 μmol of sodium cyanohydrogen boride (NaCNH3B) and 3.75 μmol of [14C]formaldehyde (59 mCi/mmol) (Amersham Corp.) and was incubated for 1.5 h under nitrogen with constant mixing. After the addition of another 62.5 μmol NaCNH3B and further incubation of 1.5 h, trfd was precipitated by 10% (w/v, final concentration) trichloric acid (TCA). The trfd precipitate was washed 3 times with ice-cold acetone and, after evaporation of the acetone, dissolved in 600 μl of distilled water to a concentration of 2 mg/ml, divided into aliquots, and stored under nitrogen at −20°C. The 14C-labeled transit peptide of ferredoxin could be visualized as a single band by Tricine/SDS-PAGE (32Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) followed by fluorography. It was shown that all applied radioactivity was present in the peptide band. The specific activity of [14C]trfd was 49 mCi/mmol, and trfd contained 0.8 [14C]methyl group per molecule. Chloroplasts were isolated out of 10-12-day-old pea seedlings cv. Feltham First as described(33Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Luben T.H. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3691-3696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Import reactions (28Pilon M. De Boer A.D. Knols S.L. Koppelman M.H.G.M. Van der Graaf R.M. De Kruijff B. Weisbeek P.J. J. Biol.

Import mixtures with a volume of 300 μl were used containing chloroplasts to an equivalent of 60 μg of chlorophyll and trfd and prefd, as indicated. Chloroplasts were added to (poly)peptide containing import mixtures. Import experiments were carried out at under import conditions (i.e. 25°C in the light for 20 min) unless indicated otherwise. After the import experiment, 1 ml of ice-cold import buffer was added to stop the import process, and the samples were divided into two fractions. In one fraction, the chloroplasts were reisolated, washed, and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting and gel electrophoresis. This fraction contained both imported and bound trfd and prefd molecules. The other fraction was incubated for 15 min at 4°C with 7.5 μg of thermolysin to digest (poly)peptides bound to the chloroplast surface (34Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently treated as above, yielding the amount of trfd and prefd imported into the chloroplasts. The chloroplast recovery was determined by measuring the total amount of protein according to Bradford(29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The influence of DTT on prefd and trfd import was investigated by import experiments in the presence of DTT concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 mM. Because chlorophyll interferes with the analysis of trfd by Tricine/SDS-PAGE(32Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), the peptide was precipitated by 80% acetone, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant, which did not contain trfd as was verified by liquid scintillation counting, was removed, and traces of acetone were evaporated. The pellet was resuspended in 6 M urea, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, and 2 mM DTT by sonication for 15 min in a bath sonicator. Samples containing prefd were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli(35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protease pretreated chloroplasts were obtained by incubation of chloroplasts equivalent to 1 mg of chlorophyll with 250 μg of thermolysin for 20 min at 4°C in the dark. Subsequently, the chloroplasts were reisolated by centrifugation through a preformed 50% Percoll gradient containing 2 mM EDTA in order to block the thermolysin activity. Chloroplast fractionation was performed by hypertonic lysis in 10 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, followed by a centrifugation for 30 min at 60,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor. The membrane pellet was resuspended for further analysis. In order to decrease the sample size of the supernatant fraction, the proteins were precipitated by 80% acetone. The pellet was resuspended in 6 M urea, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, and 2 mM DTT by sonication for 15 min in a bath sonicator. After incubation under import conditions, unless indicated otherwise, of 2.5 μg of [14C]trfd in 300 μl of import buffer containing chloroplasts to an equivalent of 60 μg of chlorophyll, proteins were precipitated by incubation with TCA (final concentration, 10%, w/v) for 15 min at 0°C. Intact trfd is quantitatively precipitated under these conditions. The protein pellet was resuspended in 300 μl in 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 8 M urea, and 20 mM DTT by sonication. The percentage of radioactive label present in the pellet and supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. In order to localize trfd and trfd degradation products after the incubation, the chloroplasts were pelleted and resuspended. In both, the resuspended chloroplast pellet and supernatant proteins were precipitated by TCA, and the fraction of precipitable radioactivity was determined. In some experiments, chloroplasts were lysed in import buffer with a sorbitol concentration of 80 mM. In order to investigate whether binding of trfd to lipid domains could result in protease protection of trfd, binding experiments of trfd (2 μg added) to large unilamellar vesicles of 200 nmol of lipid composed of a lipid extract of the chloroplast outer envelope membrane were performed according to (36van't Hof R. De Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Vesicles containing associated trfd (0.29 μg) separated from nonassociated trfd by centrifugation were incubated for 15 min with 7.5 μg of thermolysin at room temperature. The ability of [14C]trfd to associate with chloroplasts was investigated under conditions where prefd is imported and correctly processed in the light at 25°C in a buffer containing 2 mM ATP(28Pilon M. De Boer A.D. Knols S.L. Koppelman M.H.G.M. Van der Graaf R.M. De Kruijff B. Weisbeek P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3358-3361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis by Tricine/SDS-PAGE of reisolated and washed chloroplasts from the incubation mixtures showed that in time increasing amounts of trfd became stable associated with the organelle (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether chloroplast associated trfd was bound to the chloroplast surface, the incubation mixtures were treated with thermolysin, which is not able to enter the chloroplast intermembrane space and which can only digest proteins that are present on the chloroplast surface(34Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the majority of the associated trfd was not degraded (Fig. 1B). In control experiments, comparable amounts of trfd in the import buffer were digested within 30 s by identical amounts of thermolysin (data not shown). Furthermore, trfd associated to large unilamellar vesicles with a lipid composition comparable with the chloroplast outer envelope membrane was found to be completely digestable by thermolysin (data not shown). This indicated that binding to lipid surfaces does not result in protection against proteases. It can therefore be concluded that trfd had reached a protease-protected position, which we define as “import.” Quantification of this time course experiment (Fig. 1C) shows that association and import of trfd is a linear process in time. The addition of increasing amounts of labeled trfd to isolated intact chloroplasts under import conditions led to an increased association of trfd to chloroplasts (data not shown). Association and import of [14C]trfd is saturable. Moreover, association and import are tightly coupled over a large range of transit peptide concentrations. From these results it can be calculated that maximal 16 ± 2 × 103 trfd molecules/minute/chloroplast are imported assuming that 30 μg of chlorophyll corresponds to 4.5 × 107 chloroplasts(21Pilon M. De Kruijff B. Weisbeek P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2548-2556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The value of the Vmax of trfd import is close to the value of the Vmax of 22 × 103 molecules/minute/chloroplast reported for prefd import(37Pilon M. Weisbeek P.J. De Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Quantification of the experiment shown in Fig. 1 showed that nearly all chloroplast-associated trfd was present in the trfd band (data not shown). Fractionation of reisolated chloroplasts from incubation mixtures revealed that all chloroplast-associated radioactivity is localized in the membrane fraction (Fig. 2A). These observations do not exclude the possibility that part of the transit peptide is degraded during or after import. That this may be the case is suggested by the observation that the transit sequence cleaved off from imported prefd could not be detected in the membrane fraction nor in the soluble fraction, although it contains 7 of the 13 [3H]leucine residues (Fig. 2B). This demonstrates that the transit sequence is rapidly digested after processing. It should be realized that processing of prefd cannot be observed by Tricine/SDS-PAGE as used in Fig. 2B, because this gel system does not separate prefd from holoprotein of ferredoxin. However, control experiments using SDS-PAGE demonstrated that prefd was correctly processed under the experimental conditions (data not shown). To get direct insight into possible trfd degradation within chloroplasts, TCA precipitation experiments were done (Fig. 3). Intact trfd in import buffer without chloroplasts (Fig. 3, lane 1) or with chloroplasts in conditions under which no import can take place (Fig. 3, lane 2) can be nearly quantitatively precipitated by TCA. In contrast, a large fraction of trfd incubated with lysed chloroplasts is not precipitable due to digestion by proteases released from the chloroplasts (Fig. 3, lane 3). Under import conditions a substantial fraction (13 ± 1%) of the added 14C radioactivity is nonprecipitable (Fig. 3, lane 4), which demonstrates that indeed part of the added trfd is degraded, like in case of transit sequence liberated from the import precursor. This is most likely due to digestion inside the chloroplasts, but in principle this could also, in part be due to digestion by proteases liberated from chloroplasts during the incubation. To get an estimate of the maximal contribution of such released proteases, trfd was incubated in the supernatant of chloroplasts preincubated under import conditions. This leads to substantially less (7 ± 1%) degradation (Fig. 3, lane 5). Thus, it has to be concluded that at least 6% of the added trfd is degraded by internal chloroplast proteases. This has to be compared with 15% of the added trfd, which is associated as intact trfd to chloroplasts under import conditions (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In order to determine the localization of the degradation products of trfd, intact chloroplasts were isolated by centrifugation after the incubation. In both the resuspended pellet and the supernatant, the percentage of intact and degraded trfd was determined by TCA precipitation. Table 1 demonstrates that under import conditions virtually all chloroplast-associated trfd is intact (TCA-precipitable) and that the degradation products (TCA-nonprecipitable) are present in the chloroplast supernatant. It thus has to be concluded that the trfd degradation products generated by internal chloroplast proteases are rapidly exported. trfd competes for import of prefd(27Pilon M. Rietveld A.G. Weisbeek P.J. De Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19907-19913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that the reverse is also true. Unlabeled trfd and prefd equally efficiently inhibit the import of [14C]trfd, indicating that prefd and trfd compete for the same limiting import step. Competition is a specific process depending on the transit sequence because apofd is not able to inhibit trfd import (Fig. 4). Binding and import of precursor proteins into chloroplasts require ATP as energy source(5De Boer A.D. Weisbeek P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). ATP also affects chloroplast association and import of [14C]trfd (Fig. 5). In the absence of exogenous ATP, trfd already displays some association and import into chloroplasts. However, increasing the ATP concentration strongly stimulates both trfd association and import, indicating that ATP-consuming proteinaceous components are involved in trfd import. trfd association and import is maximal around 1-2 mM ATP, which is very similar to the ATP concentration of 1 mM at which prefd import is maximal(21Pilon M. De Kruijff B. Weisbeek P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2548-2556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion of proteinaceous components localized on the chloroplast surface by thermolysin reduces the import of precursor proteins into chloroplasts(33Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Luben T.H. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3691-3696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as is shown for prefd in Fig. 6. In contrast, the import of trfd is hardly affected by protease pretreatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the functioning of transit sequences in chloroplast protein import. The approach was to study the import of the full-length transit peptide of ferredoxin. It was shown that trfd enters the general import pathway of proteins into chloroplasts. This conclusion is based on the following observations. First, associated trfd is largely protected against externally added protease, indicating that trfd has reached an internal chloroplast localization. Second, [14C]trfd import is equally efficiently inhibited by nonlabeled trfd and prefd. Third, trfd inhibits the import of prefd into chloroplasts(27Pilon M. Rietveld A.G. Weisbeek P.J. De Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19907-19913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, trfd import is saturable and occurs with a maximal velocity close to the value of the Vmax of prefd import(37Pilon M. Weisbeek P.J. De Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Finally, trfd import is stimulated by ATP. This is the first example of a targeting signal for which translocation across a membrane is stimulated by ATP. This differs strikingly from the situation in mitochondria where the translocation step of the presequence is driven by the membrane potential (Δψ) across the inner membrane(38Gasser S.M. Daum G. Schatz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 277: 368-373Google Scholar, 39Schleyer M. Schmidt B. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 40Pfanner N. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 41Eilers M. Oppliger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This difference in the energy required for protein translocation into chloroplasts and mitochondria demonstrates that the mechanisms of protein import into both organelles are fundamentally different. The stimulation of trfd import by ATP can, for instance, be due to interactions of trfd with membrane-associated chaperonines and to the fact that ATP is consumed in transit sequence-chaperone binding/release steps. From a comparison of transit sequences, it was postulated that they are unstructured, which makes them prone to interact with chaperonines(42Von Heijne G. Nishikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 3335-3342Google Scholar). After import, protease-protected intact trfd could be identified solely in the membrane fraction. The absence of trfd in the soluble fraction, which mainly consists of the stroma, could indicate that trfd import is halted at the level of the envelope membranes. This would suggest that interaction of the mature region of precursor proteins with the import machinery is required to complete the import into the stroma. The observation that fusion proteins, for instance consisting of the ferredoxin transit sequence and the yeast mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase(23Smeekens S. Van Steeg H. Bauerle C. Bettenbroek H. Keegstra K. Weisbeek P.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 9: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), are correctly imported into the stroma suggests that this presumed interaction should be rather aspecific. Alternatively, and more likely, the absence of trfd in the stroma could be due to digestion of trfd during or after import. In agreement with this proposal, it was observed that part of the chloroplast-associated trfd was digested by internal chloroplast proteases. This protease activity was not associated to the chloroplast surface because incubation of trfd with chloroplasts, under the condition that no import could take place, resulted in only a marginal trfd degradation. Instead, the degradation was shown to be largely due to internal proteases. This protease activity could be present in the stroma, because the cleaved transit sequence after import of prefd into the stroma could not be detected in the membrane nor in the soluble fraction. The proposed degradation of trfd in the stroma indicates that the membrane-associated protease-protected trfd is en route to its functional localization. The degradation of transit sequences after import may be required to prevent the accumulation of large amounts of transit sequence, which may very well have a poisoning effect. For instance, the surface-active and membrane-seeking properties of transit sequences (26van't Hof R. Van Klompenburg W. Pilon M. Kozubek A. De Korte-Kool G. Demel R.A. Weisbeek P.J. De Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4037-4042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could lead to membrane insertion of large amounts of transit sequences, affecting membrane functioning. Furthermore, this result strongly argues against a second long-lived function of transit sequences in chloroplasts. Surprisingly, although trfd was degraded by internal protease, the degradation products were almost entirely present in the external chloroplast medium. Therefore, the degradation products should be exported out of the chloroplast by a so far unknown mechanism. This transport process could enable the reuse of transit sequence degradation products in the cytosolic protein synthesis. trfd is imported into chloroplasts along the general import pathway of the precursor protein; therefore differences in import characteristics of trfd and prefd may be related to differences in import requirements of transit sequences and mature part of precursor proteins. One striking difference between trfd and prefd import was the independence of trfd import to protease-sensitive components on the chloroplast surface. Also, the import of outer envelope membrane proteins was shown to be independent of protease-sensitive components on the chloroplast surface(44Li H.M. Moore T. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 45Salomon M. Fisher K. Flügge U.I. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5778-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 46Wu C. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19384-19391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but these proteins likely follow an alternative pathway(44Li H.M. Moore T. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, the protease-sensitive components of the chloroplast surface seem not to be involved in trfd binding and import. This suggests that trfd initially binds to the chloroplast surface by interactions with the membrane lipids. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that prefd inserts, via its transit sequence, efficiently and specifically in lipid monolayers composed of a lipid extract of its target membrane (26van't Hof R. Van Klompenburg W. Pilon M. Kozubek A. De Korte-Kool G. Demel R.A. Weisbeek P.J. De Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4037-4042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and binds to lipid vesicles(36van't Hof R. De Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transit sequence-lipid interactions may result in the insertion of the transit sequence in lipid domains(36van't Hof R. De Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), enabling the diffusion of precursors to the import machinery in a two-dimensional way, which will be more efficient than via three-dimensional diffusion through the aqueous phase. Besides this, transit sequence-lipid interactions result in the induction of secondary structures in the otherwise unstructured transit peptide, which may function as recognition motive for the import machinery (47Horniak L. Pilon M. van't Hof R. De Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) Furthermore, these interactions can result in reorientation of lipid molecules(48Chupin V. van't Hof R. De Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This change in lipid organization can directly be involved in protein import (49Killian J.A. De Jong A.M.P. Bijvelt J. Verkleij A.J. De Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or be required for the activation of the import machinery. Comparison of the dissociation constants reveals that trfd binds with a 30-fold lower affinity to lipid vesicles than a precursor protein to chloroplasts(22Friedman A.L. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 993-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36van't Hof R. De Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This suggests that the initial binding to the lipids is followed by an interaction with proteinaceous components of the import machinery. Recent studies (50Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-157Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 51Perry S.E. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 52Schnell D. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 53Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) have identified several of these proteinaceous components. Schnell et al.(52Schnell D. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and Kessler et al.(53Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) identified six envelope membrane proteins associated to a translocation intermediate. Two of these proteins, of 34 and 86 kDa, are both integral outer envelope membrane proteins and are supposed to be exposed to the cytosol, due to their sensitivity to externally added proteases. Because trfd import is independent of protease-sensitive components on the chloroplast surface, it is unlikely that the 34- and 86-kDa proteins directly interact with the transit sequence and are involved in precursor protein targeting. Subsequently, it is unlikely that these proteins function as proposed by Kessler et al.(53Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) in the regulation of the presentation of transit sequences to the import machinery or by regulating the opening of the translocation channel. The 34- and 86-kDa proteins are most likely required for the import of the mature region of the precursor, and can perform the following functions. First, by interacting with the mature part region of the precursor, they could stabilize the binding of precursors to the chloroplast surface. Second, they may be required for a productive interaction of the precursor with other components of the import machinery. Finally, they may be required to bring the precursor in an import-competent conformation, for instance by reduction or by unfolding of mature regions of precursor proteins. In case of prefd, they could act as reductases because prefd import is stimulated by DTT (21Pilon M. De Kruijff B. Weisbeek P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2548-2556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas trfd import was independent of the DTT concentration (data not shown). Guérra et al.(43Guérra A. America T. Van Waas M. Weisbeek P.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) observed the unfolding of a precursor protein when incubated with outer envelope membrane vesicles, but whether this activity was protein- or lipid-mediated is not known We thank Karin Brouwer for preparing the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2113089612,"Conditions are reported that, for the first time, permit the folding and assembly of active chaperonin, GroEL, following denaturation in 8 M urea. The folding could be achieved by dilution or dialysis, and the best yields required the simultaneous presence of ammonium sulfate and the Mg2+ complexes of ATP or ADP. Ammonium sulfate was the key to this particular protocol, since there was a small recovery of oligomer in its presence, but no detectable recovery was induced by ATP or ADP without ammonium sulfate. The refolded/reassembled GroEL could arrest the spontaneous folding of rhodanese, and it could participate in the chaperonin-assisted refolding of rhodanese as effectively as GroEL that had never been unfolded. The results demonstrate that the primary sequence of GroEL contains the information required for its folding, assembly, and function. Thus, in contrast to previous studies, although chaperonins may facilitate GroEL folding, they are not necessary for the acquisition of the functional oligomeric state of this chaperone. This ability to fold denatured GroEL in vitro will facilitate studies of the influences that determine the interesting folding pattern adopted by the native protein.

This ability to fold denatured GroEL in vitro will facilitate studies of the influences that determine the interesting folding pattern adopted by the native protein. The essential Escherichia coli protein, GroEL (cpn60), is a molecular chaperone that has been extensively studied for its ability to assist the refolding and reassembly of a large number of diverse proteins(1Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Although there is a great deal of interest in GroEL function, the detailed molecular mechanism is incompletely understood. Phenomenologically, GroEL can form stable binary complexes with labile folding intermediates of proteins, thereby preventing aggregation that competes with folding(2Golubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 3Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H.

Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). The release of active, folded protein is often ATP-dependent, and, in the most efficient cases, the release is also dependent on a second protein, the co-chaperonin, GroES(1Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2Golubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H.

GroEL is an oligomeric protein containing 14 identical 60-kDa subunits arranged in two stacked 7-membered rings that form a cylinder(4Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). One outstanding question is how GroEL, itself, is folded and assembled. Attempts to refold and reassemble functional GroEL oligomers after complete denaturation have been unsuccessful(5Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Thomson G.J. Coggins J.R. Wood S. auf der Mauer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1161: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated, though, that native GroEL and GroES could assist the assembly of monomeric GroEL that had not been unfolded, and it was suggested that the formation of native chaperonin might require the intervention of preexisting chaperones (6Lissen N.M. Venyaminov S.Y. Girshovich A.S. Nature. 1990; 348: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The sequence of GroEL contains all the amino acids encoded by the gene with the exception of the initiating methionine, and there are no reported post-translational modifications. Thus, GroEL would appear to contain all the sequence information required for folding/assembly. The x-ray structure reveals an interesting folding pattern for the GroEL monomer. The monomer, within the tetradecamer (14-mer), is folded into three domains. 1) The equatorial domain, which consists of residues 6−133 together with 409−523, is highly α-helical and well ordered(4Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). It provides most of the contacts between subunits in one ring and all contacts between the rings. 2) The small intermediate domain contains residues 134−190 together with 377−408. 3) The apical domain contains residues 191−376, and it has been suggested to be responsible for the interaction with partially folded polypeptides(7Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). This domain contains many hydrophobic residues, and the apical domain is the least well resolved portion of the crystal structure presumably because of its flexibility(4Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). The GroEL monomer presents an intriguing folding problem, since the first biosynthesized sequence must extensively interact with the last biosynthesized portion to form the largest and most structured equatorial domain. In fact, in vitro studies performed to date have failed to refold and reassemble GroEL after complete denaturation(5Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Thomson G.J. Coggins J.R. Wood S. auf der Mauer A. Biochim.

It has been suggested recently that GroEL treated with 3−4 M urea contains a region of hydrophobic residual structure within the amino acid sequence that corresponds to the apical domain. 1B. Gorovits, personal communication. This residual structure could serve as a nucleation site for folding as well as an interactive region that could lead to misfolding under some conditions. Since misfolding of denatured GroEL is essentially a kinetic trap, it is clear why chaperonins could assist the process, and it implies that conditions could be arranged that would permit the thermodynamic potential of the sequence to be realized and produce folded/assembled GroEL. The present work demonstrates that such conditions can be found, permitting GroEL to refold/reassemble without the addition of any preformed chaperonins. Thus, the sequence of GroEL contains all the information required for its unusual folding pattern. Rhodanese was prepared as described previously (10Miller D.M. Kurzban G.P. Mendoza J.A. Chirgwin J.M. Hardies S.C. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and stored at −70°C as a crystalline suspension in 1.8 M ammonium sulfate. Rhodanese concentrations were determined using A280 nm0.1% = 1.75 (11Sorbo B.H. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar) and a molecular mass of 33 kDa(12Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russel J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Rhodanese activity was assayed using a colorimetric method based on the absorbance at 460 nm of the complex formed between the reaction product, thiocyanate, and ferric ion(11Sorbo B.H. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar). The chaperonin, GroEL, was purified from lysates of E. coli cells bearing the plasmid pND5(14Jenkins A.J. March J.B. Oliver I.R. Masters M. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1986; 202: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The purification was a modified version of previously published protocols(15Staniforth R.A. Cortes A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After purification, GroEL was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol and then made 10% (v/v) in glycerol, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. The concentration of GroEL was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. GroEL was unfolded by incubation in 8 M urea at 25°C for 90 min. The GroEL was at 10 mg/ml in 50 mM triethanolamine acetate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.1 mM EDTA. These conditions were previously demonstrated to produce GroEL that was completely unfolded(16Mendoza J.A. Demeler B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2447-2451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Refolding was done either by dilution or microdialysis. For dilution, the refolding mixture typically contained 50 mM triethanolamine acetate, pH 7.5, and one or more of the following additives as specified in the text: 5 mM ATP; 10 mM MgCl2; or 5 mM ADP. GroEL was added to 0.625 mg/ml. The urea concentration was 0.5 M from the carryover. Other additives are specified in the text. Refolding was allowed to continue for 30 min. Microdialysis for refolding was performed by the method of Marusky and Sergeant(17Marusky R. Sergeant A. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 403-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Typically, 85 μl of the solution containing denatured GroEL was placed on a VMWP Millipore membrane (0.05 μm), which was made to float on 20 ml of the dialysate in a Petri dish that was then covered to permit equilibration. The samples were incubated at 25°C for 2 h. After dialysis, the samples were removed, and the protein concentrations were determined. Aliquots of the dialysate were added to the blanks and standards to compensate for any background. Dye solutions were used to determine the efficiency of dialysis and the times required for equilibration. Rhodanese was denatured in 8 M urea, 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and a protein concentration of 300 μg/ml. Unfolded rhodanese was diluted (109 nM final concentration) into 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 200 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM sodium thiosulfate, and GroEL at a concentration of 2.5 μM (protomer). GroES and ATP were at final concentrations of 2.5 μM (protomer) and 2 mM, respectively. Rhodanese refolding was monitored by the regain of its activity using the assay described above (11Sorbo B.H. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar). GroEL tetradecamers and monomers were detected by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels using the method of Neuhoff et al.(18Neuhoff V. Cheong-Kim K-S. Altland K. Electrophoresis. 1986; 7: 56-57Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed at pH 8.8 in the resolving gel. This procedure has previously been documented as accurately reflecting the content of stable monomers and 14-mers in samples of GroEL(19Mendoza J.A. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). high performance liquid chromatography. high performance liquid chromatography. Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a TosoHaas TSK G4000-PW column (0.75 mm × 30 cm) on a Waters HPLC system. The elution buffer contained 25 mM Na2PO4, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the peaks were detected by monitoring absorbance at 230 nm. Samples containing 125 μg in 200 μl were injected onto the column, which was run at 25°C. After unfolding GroEL in 8 M urea, it was noticed that dilution of samples into buffers containing ammonium sulfate gave a small amount of material that co-electrophoresed with tetradecamers on non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. This is exemplified in lane 3 of Fig. 2 which contains Mg2+ in addition to 0.4 M ammonium sulfate. This was of interest, since control samples without ammonium sulfate gave no detectable 14-mers (e.g. lane 4 in Fig. 2), and previous reports indicated that it was not possible to produce active, reassembled GroEL after denaturation(5Price N.C.

Acta. 1995; 1247: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In those previous experiments, attempted refolding gave only monomers that were misfolded. Experiments were carried out to determine conditions required to optimize oligomeric GroEL and assess its function. Fig. 1B shows the electrophoretic behavior of GroEL 14-mers (lane 1) and monomers formed in 8 M urea (lane 2) and electrophoresed without urea. The gel does not contain urea so the only monomers observed are those that are formed irreversibly, since urea is removed upon electrophoresis and monomers formed at <3-4 M reassemble during electrophoresis(19Mendoza J.A. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The smeared appearance of the monomers from 8 M urea is regularly observed, and it is presumably due to heterogeneity of misfolded species and/or to interactions of the monomeric species with the polyacrylamide gel. GroEL has been shown to be completely unfolded at >4-5 M urea and to remain monomeric when diluted into buffer as the sample for lane 2 of Fig. 1B(16Mendoza J.A. Demeler B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2447-2451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that in the presence of ATP, increasing concentrations of ammonium sulfate give increasing amounts of species that co-electrophorese with 14-mers (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-4). There are some higher molecular weight discrete species that presumably contain more than 14 monomers or that have shapes different from the normal 14-mer. Sodium sulfate at 0.8 M (Fig. 1A, lane 5) is less effective at producing discrete oligomers, and no oligomers were observed at 0.4 M sodium sulfate (data not shown). Ammonium chloride (Fig. 1B, lane 3) and sodium chloride (Fig. 1B, lane 4) were ineffective at promoting oligomer formation in the presence of ATP. ATP alone did not lead to the appearance of any oligomer (Fig. 2 lane 6). In the absence of ammonium sulfate, incubations with ADP gave no detectable oligomer (Fig. 1B, lane 5), but there was a small amount of 14-mer produced if ADP was present together with ammonium sulfate (Fig. 1B, lane 6). The addition of ADP and Mg2+ together with ammonium sulfate led to the formation of a considerable amount of 14-mer (Fig. 1B, lane 7), and in repeated experiments these conditions tended to produce the least heterogeneity in the oligomeric GroEL. These results were confirmed by HPLC size exclusion chromatography as described under “Materials and Methods.” Chromatograms were developed for GroEL that was reassembled with ADP, Mg2+, and ammonium sulfate (Fig. 1B, lane 7). Peaks from the chromatograms were quantified by integration, and fractions were subjected to non-denaturing electrophoresis to verify the correspondence between electrophoretic bands and chromatographic peaks. GroEL that was never disassembled and GroEL that was disassembled were used as controls. Species that would correspond to the light bands observed above the major band in Fig. 1B, lane 7, were not observed during chromatography, and they may have resulted from the concentrating effect of the electrophoresis. The chromatograms of a sample of this renatured/reassembled GroEL contained 89.6% 14-mers and 10.4% monomers. This compared with the control 14-mers, which contained 94.1% 14-mers and 5.9% monomers. The initial preparation before reassembly contained 17% 14-mers and 83% monomers. Fig. 2 shows that ammonium sulfate is a critical component in the formation of oligomeric GroEL from the protein unfolded in 8 M urea. As noted above, a very small amount of 14-mer is formed with ammonium sulfate and Mg2+ (Fig. 2 lane 3). ATP plus ammonium sulfate gives a substantial increase in the formation of oligomers. The largest amounts of oligomers are formed in the presence of ammonium sulfate, Mg2+, and ATP (Fig. 2 lane 2), although there appears to be more heterogeneity compared with the use of ADP. In the absence of ammonium sulfate, there are no detectable oligomers with ATP and/or Mg2+ (Fig. 2 lanes 4-6). GroEL that was refolded in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and ammonium sulfate by the dialysis method described under “Materials and Methods” was tested for function both by its ability to arrest the spontaneous folding of rhodanese and by its ability to participate in the complete chaperonin-assisted folding of rhodanese that requires the co-chaperonin, GroES, and ATP hydrolysis. Under the conditions used here, unfolded rhodanese was refolded spontaneously to 13% relative to a control that had not been unfolded. Reassembled GroEL was able to completely arrest this spontaneous folding (100% arrest), while an equivalent amount of GroEL that had never been unfolded was able to arrest rhodanese folding to the extent of 96%. Refolded GroEL was able to facilitate rhodanese folding in the complete chaperonin system, and it led to 36% refolding in the assay described under “Materials and Methods.” By comparison, an equivalent amount of GroEL that had never been unfolded led to 34.6% refolding of rhodanese in the complete chaperonin system. Similar experiments using GroEL refolded by the dilution method (see “Materials and Methods”) gave essentially identical results. On some gels, the reassembled oligomers did not exactly co-electrophorese with control 14-mers that had never been denatured. However, the reassembled oligomers always displayed very similar levels of activity as the controls. This may indicate either that the control samples contained bound polypeptides, as previously reported(13Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.-U. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which affected their electrophoresis and were lost on reassembly, or it may indicate that GroEL could reassemble to oligomers that were not precisely organized, and interactions with the other components in the assay such as GroES served to align the GroEL to its functional state. In conclusion, GroEL can be refolded and reassembled after denaturation in 8 M urea to produce a product that is functional in arresting rhodanese folding and assisting folding of denatured rhodanese in the complete chaperonin system containing GroES and requiring ATP hydrolysis. In this regard, the refolded GroEL is equivalent to GroEL that has never been unfolded. The minimal requirements for efficient refolding in the present work include the Mg2+ complexes of ATP or ADP together with ammonium sulfate. The key element appears to be the ammonium sulfate, since there is a small amount of oligomer formed in its presence, but there is no formation of oligomers facilitated by ATP or ADP in its absence. Thus, it is clear that the sequence of GroEL contains all the information required for folding of the monomers and for their assembly into oligomeric structures that can be fully functional."
https://openalex.org/W2019948850,"Abstract Shc is an SH2-containing adapter protein that binds to and is phosphorylated by a large number of growth factor receptors. Phosphorylated Shc is able to interact with the Grb2-Sos complex which is responsible for mediating nucleotide exchange on Ras. We have shown previously that binding of Shc to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like receptor, c-ErbB-3, is through an NPXY motif (Prigent, S. A., and Gullick, W. J.(1994) EMBO J. 13, 2831−2841) shared by middle T antigen, TrkA, and EGF receptor. It has recently been reported that a region distinct from the SH2 domain is able to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. In this paper we have used fusion proteins of various Shc domains to show that it is the N-terminal domain of Shc that is primarily responsible for binding EGF receptor and c-ErbB-3. Furthermore, by competition studies with synthetic phosphopeptides we have shown that this N-terminal domain binds to the previously identified NPXY motif."

In the present study, the library was screened to identify regions that might function as autoinhibitory domains. Peptides from two distinct regions were found to inhibit the Ca2+-activated holoenzyme. The same regions were previously found to bind calmodulin (i.e. the δ-subunit; Dasgupta, M.

Phosphorylase kinase is among the largest and most complex of the protein kinase superfamily (reviewed by Pickett-Gies and Walsh(1Pickett-Gies C.A. Walsh D.A. Boyer P.D. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1985: 395-459Google Scholar)). Because of its complex structure, the catalytic activity of phosphorylase kinase is sensitive to a variety of effectors and chemical modifications including pH, divalent metal ions, ionic strength and composition, glycogen, calmodulin, nucleosides, phosphorylation state, limited proteolysis, and substrate conformation. The subunit composition of phosphorylase kinase is α4β4γ4δ4, where the α-, β-, and δ-subunits are regulatory and the γ-subunit harbors the catalytic site. The α- and β-subunits can be phosphorylated, and this modification increases the enzyme's catalytic activity, whereas the δ-subunit is identical to calmodulin and confers Ca2+ dependence to the enzyme's activity. Although the α-, β-, and δ-subunits are all thought to interact directly with the γ-subunit, the molecular mechanisms by which these regulatory subunits effect changes in catalytic activity is not well understood at present. A common mechanism by which the catalytic activity of many protein kinases appears to be regulated is through a pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory mechanism (see reviews by Soderling (2Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1823-1826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Kemp and Pearson(3Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)). This intrasteric form of regulation was first described in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but there is now substantial evidence that this mechanism may also be operating in the cGMP-dependent protein kinases, myosin light chain kinases, calmodulin-dependent type II kinases, the protein kinase-Cs, as well as the protein phosphatase calcineurin(2Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1823-1826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The simplest mechanistic model for this form of regulation consists of two conformational states: an autoinhibited enzymatically inactive (or less active) state and a deinhibited active (or more active) state. In the autoinhibited state, an autoinhibitory regulatory domain occupies the enzyme's substrate-binding site and prevents access of the protein substrate to the catalytic site. Upon binding of an allosteric activator to the regulatory domain, a conformational change is induced in the autoinhibitory domain that removes it from the substrate-binding site allowing free access of the substrate to the catalytic site. Typically, the amino acid sequence of an autoinhibitory domain closely resembles the consensus sequence of that enzyme's preferred substrates and is then termed a pseudosubstrate domain. In a number of cases, protein kinase pseudosubstrate domains also contain phosphorylatable residues, and these residues can be autophosphorylated. Thus, identification of putative pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory domains often entails visual inspection of a protein kinase's regulatory domain for sequences that resemble consensus substrate sequences. Candidate pseudosubstrate sequences are then chemically synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit the enzyme in question. Although the peptide representing an enzyme's pseudosubstrate domain should act as a competitive inhibitor of the protein (or peptide) substrate, this is not always the case(2Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1823-1826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is conceivable that selecting a putative pseudosubstrate domain on the basis of similarity to a substrate consensus sequence could result in a false positive identification, particularly if the inhibitory capacity of the putative synthetic pseudosubstrate is low. Thus, positive identification of putative pseudosubstrate domains must be supported by other data including site-directed mutagenesis and x-ray crystallographic structures. The present investigation is the second phase of a long term effort to characterize the structure-function relationships of the regulatory domain of the γ-subunit of phosphorylase kinase. The regulatory domain of the γ-subunit is defined here as the region spanning amino acids 277-386 of this subunit. The first phase of this investigative effort involved identification of putative δ-subunit-binding domains in the regulatory domain by preparing a library of 18 overlapping synthetic peptides spanning residues 277-386 and screening each peptide for its ability to bind calmodulin(4Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two noncontiguous peptides were identified as being likely δ-subunit-binding domains. In the present study, the same synthetic peptide library has been used to screen for possible γ-subunit autoinhibitory domains. Two noncontiguous regions in the γ-subunit regulatory domain have been identified that display the properties expected of pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory domains. These results are being used to direct structural studies to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of phosphorylase kinase catalytic activity. A series of 18 overlapping 25-residue peptides corresponding to the C-terminal 110 residues(277-386) of the γ-subunit of phosphorylase kinase was synthesized and characterized as described by Dasgupta et al.(4Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each peptide was assigned a number based on its position relative to the C terminus of the γ-subunit of phosphorylase kinase(4Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nomenclature and sequence of each peptide are shown in Table 1.

All of the peptides in 1, 2 were synthesized with glycine-amide C termini.

Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) using phenyl-Sepharose (Sigma), and gel filtration chromatography (Bio-Gel A-0.5m, Bio-Rad). The rate of incorporation of 32P into glycogen phosphorylase b was used to measure phosphorylase kinase activity. The final reaction mixtures (50 μl) for the inhibition experiments contained 50 mM Tris, 50 mM β-glycerol phosphate, pH 8.2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 30 μM phosphorylase b, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 100 μM calcium chloride, 1 mM ATP (≈300 counts/min/pmol; DuPont NEN), 1 μg/ml nonactivated phosphorylase kinase, and varying concentrations of synthetic γ-subunit peptides as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were performed in duplicate at 30°C, and 20-μl samples of each reaction were spotted on Whatman 3MM filter paper squares (1 × 1 cm) at 5 and 15 min. The squares were immediately immersed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, 4% sodium pyrophosphate and processed as described by Corbin and Reimann(9Corbin J.D. Reimann E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 38: 287-290Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar). All rates of phosphorylation were linear with respect to time for at least 15 min. Calmodulin-binding activity was quantitated using a myosin light chain kinase inhibition assay as described previously(4Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (50 μl final volume) for peptide inhibition experiments contained 50 mM MOPS, 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. pH 7.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 130 μM substrate peptide (KKRPQRATSNVFS-amide), 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.2 mM calcium chloride, 10 nM calmodulin, 1.3 nM skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase, 1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (≈300 counts/min/pmol; DuPont NEN), and varying concentrations of synthetic γ-subunit peptides as indicated. Reactions were performed in duplicate at 30°C, and 20-μl samples of the reaction were spotted on Whatman P81 phosphocellulose filter paper squares (1 × 1 cm) at 5 and 15 min. The squares were immediately immersed in 75 mM phosphoric acid and processed as described by Roskoski(10Roskoski R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). All rates of 32P incorporation were linear with respect to time for at least 15 min. 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. The concentration of myosin light chain kinase was determined by the method of Bradford(11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Other protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using values of E280 nm,1% of 12.4 for phosphorylase kinase (12Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and 13.2 for phosphorylase b(13Kastenschmidt L.L. Kastenschmidt J. Helmreich E. Biochemistry. 1968; 17: 3590-3608Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar), respectively, and a value of E276 nm,1% of 1.8 for calmodulin(14Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Concentrations of phosphorylase b are expressed in terms of molar concentrations of monomer. The Ki values of the peptides that inhibited phosphorylase kinase activity were determined using the following equation for competitive inhibition(15Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York1974Google Scholar): i=1-v1v0=[I][I]+Ki(1+[S]Km)(Eq. 1) where i is the fractional inhibition observed in the presence of peptide inhibitor, [I] is the concentration of peptide inhibitor, [S] is the concentration of phosphorylase b (30 μM) used in the reaction mixture, Km is the Michaelis constant for phosphorylase b (33 μM), and vi and v0 are the reaction rates in the presence and absence of peptide inhibitor, respectively. Ki values were determined by Marquardt weighted non-linear least-squares fit estimation using the MathView Professional (v 1.2) program run on a Macintosh computer. The assumption of competitive inhibition used in these calculations was validated by kinetic analysis (see “Results”). The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the possible location of autoinhibitory domain(s) within the C terminus of the γ-subunit. The approach taken was analogous to that previously used to identify δ-subunit (integral calmodulin)-binding domains in the γ-subunit. This approach utilizes a library of eighteen overlapping 25-residue synthetic peptides (the sequences and nomenclature are shown in Table 1) based on the C-terminal 110 residues of the γ-subunit. The library was constructed in such a way that every 20-residue segment between residue 277 and the C terminus (residue 386) of the γ-subunit is represented in one of the 18 peptides. Each peptide in the library was assayed for its ability to inhibit the catalytic activity of nonactivated (nonphosphorylated) phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme. The assay reaction was performed at pH 8.2 in the presence of Ca2+ with limiting concentrations of the substrate, phosphorylase b. Under these conditions, a peptide that can compete with phosphorylase b for the substrate-binding site of the enzyme will inhibit enzyme activity. The results of the assay are depicted in Table 1 where the Ki value of each peptide is compared with its previously determined KD for calmodulin(4Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ki value of each peptide was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Peptides that showed no appreciable inhibition of phosphorylase kinase activity at a concentration of 50 μM are indicated as having Ki values >100,000 μM. The data in Table 1 indicate that the γ-subunit regulatory domain peptides which exhibit the most potent inhibitory activity are located in two distinct regions that closely correspond to the regions previously shown to be involved in δ-subunit interactions(4Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the peptides from each region that most strongly inhibited phosphorylase kinase activity, PhK5 and PhK13 (Ki values of 20 μM and 300 nM, respectively), are the same peptides from each region that were previously found to bind calmodulin with the highest affinity (Ki values of 20 and 6.5 nM, respectively(4Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The Ki values estimated for PhK5 and PhK13 are both within the range of values reported for autoinhibitory domain peptides from other protein kinases (40 nM to 25 μM; see reviews by Soderling (2Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1823-1826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Kemp and Pearson(3Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)). To determine the mechanism(s) by which PhK5 and PhK13 inhibit the catalytic activity of phosphorylase kinase, the kinetics of inhibition for each peptide were analyzed as a function of phosphorylase b and ATP concentration. The data obtained with PhK13 and PhK5 are plotted in Fig. 1. Fig. 1A shows double-reciprocal plots of phosphorylation rates as a function of phosphorylase b concentration obtained when nonactivated phosphorylase kinase was assayed in the presence of Ca2+ (100 μM), a fixed concentration of ATP (1 mM), and various fixed concentrations of PhK13 (0.3-3 μM). The intersection of the double-reciprocal plots for the various concentrations of PhK13 on the (1/v)-axis at [phosphorylase b]-1 = 0 indicates that PhK13 acts as a competitive inhibitor of phosphorylase b. A replot of the slopes in Fig. 1A as a function of PhK13 concentration (shown in Fig. 2A) yields an estimate of 300 nM for the value of the Ki, the same value as estimated by non-linear curve-fitting procedures (Table 1). Double-reciprocal plots of phosphorylase kinase activity as a function of ATP concentration, at various fixed concentrations of PhK13, and at a fixed concentration of phosphorylase b (30 μM) are shown in Fig. 1B. In this case, the double-reciprocal plots intersect on the [ATP]-1-axis indicating that PhK13 acts as a pure noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to ATP(15Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York1974Google Scholar).Figure 2:Determination of Kivalues for PhK13 and PhK5 from replots of slope versus peptide concentration. Slopes of lines determined from plots shown in Fig. 1 A and C, were replotted as a function of PhK13 and PhK5 concentration, respectively, to determine Ki values for PhK5 and PhK13 with respect to phosphorylase b.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The double-reciprocal plots shown in Fig. 1 indicate that the peptide PhK5 inhibits the catalytic activity of phosphorylase kinase in a manner similar to PhK13. Fig. 1C shows a series of plots in double-reciprocal format where the x axis represents the reciprocal of the concentration of phosphorylase b, the y axis represents the reciprocal of the reaction rate, and each line represents data obtained at the indicated concentration of PhK5. As in the case of PhK13, the lines converge on the y axis at [phosphorylase b]-1 = 0, indicating competitive inhibition by PhK5 with respect to phosphorylase b. A replot of the slopes of the lines in Fig. 1C as a function of PhK5 concentration (Fig. 2B) yields a Ki value for PhK5 of 20 μM, the same value obtained by non-linear curve-fitting procedures (Table 1). The double-reciprocal plots shown in Fig. 1D, where the rate of phosphorylase kinase activity is plotted as a function of ATP concentration at various fixed concentrations of PhK5, indicate that PhK5 exhibits hyperbolic (partial) mixed-type inhibition with respect to ATP(15Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York1974Google Scholar). A hyperbolic mixed-type inhibition pattern indicates that PhK5 causes a change in the Km for ATP, as well as a change in the Vmax, and is thus acting as a partial noncompetitive inhibitor. Intersection of the double-reciprocal plots below the x axis (1/[ATP]) indicates that PhK5 causes a decrease in the Km for ATP(15Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York1974Google Scholar). Secondary replots (not shown) of the reciprocal of the y axis intercept (1/Δ intercept) as a function of the reciprocal of PhK5 concentration indicate that binding of PhK5 to phosphorylase kinase decreases the Km for ATP by about 2-fold (α = 0.47) and reduces Vmax by about 5-fold (β = 0.18). A pure noncompetitive inhibitor would have no effect on Km (α = 1) and would totally block catalysis when bound to the enzyme (β = 0). Thus, PhK5 and PhK13 both act as competitive inhibitors of phosphorylase b, and both are noncompetitive inhibitors of ATP, although unlike PhK13, PhK5 is not a pure noncompetitive inhibitor of ATP. The pattern of inhibition seen with PhK5 and PhK13 is consistent with the phosphorylation reaction mechanism being a sequential rapid-equilibrium random Bi-Bi mechanism, as previously reported(16Tabatabai L.B. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2196-2202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chan K.-F.J. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5948-5955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Farrar Y.J.K. Carlson G.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10274-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The pattern of inhibition seen here is similar to what was reported using synthetic peptides based on the putative autoinhibitory domain of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase, an enzyme that also exhibits a rapid-equilibrium random Bi-Bi mechanism (19Yazawa M. Yagi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Geuss U. Mayr G.W. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Those peptides inhibited myosin light chain kinase competitively with respect to phosphate acceptor substrate and noncompetitively with respect to ATP(21Kennelly P.J. Edelman A.M. Blumenthal D.K. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11958-11963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As in the case of myosin light chain kinase(21Kennelly P.J. Edelman A.M. Blumenthal D.K. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11958-11963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), addition of a molar equivalent of calmodulin relative to inhibitor peptide was able to overcome inhibition (data not shown). The finding that both PhK5 and PhK13 are competitive inhibitors of phosphorylase b phosphorylation raises the question as to whether the peptides can act synergistically or whether their inhibition is mutually exclusive. To answer this question, the activity of phosphorylase kinase inhibited by mixtures of PhK5 and PhK13 was analyzed graphically using Dixon plots, as shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3A, the reciprocal of the reaction rate is plotted as a function of PhK13 concentration at various fixed concentrations of PhK5. The same data are shown in Fig. 3B, but in this plot the reciprocal of the reaction rate is plotted as a function of PhK5 concentration, with each line representing a different concentration of PhK13. In Fig. 3 A and B, the lines converge indicating that inhibition by PhK5 and PhK13 with respect to phosphorylase b is synergistic(15Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York1974Google Scholar). Parallel lines would have indicated that the two peptides inhibited the enzyme in a mutually exclusive manner. The point at which the lines converge in each plot provides information regarding the degree of cooperativity between the two inhibitors. The x axis value where the lines converge is equal to -αKi, where Ki is the inhibition constant for the inhibitor that was varied and α is the coefficient of cooperativity. When α = 1, it indicates a lack of cooperativity between the inhibitors. When α > 1, it indicates that inhibitor binding is negatively cooperative, whereas when α < 1, it indicates that inhibitor binding is positively cooperative. The values of α calculated from Fig. 3 A and B, were 0.35 and 0.67, respectively, based on the previously determined Ki values for PhK13 and PhK5 (0.3 and 20 μM, respectively; cf. Table 1 and Fig. 2). These two estimates for α are in reasonable agreement with each other and indicate that the simultaneous binding of PhK5 and PhK13 to the phosphorylase b substrate-binding site shows modest positive cooperativity (0.3 ≤α≤ 0.7). These values indicate that the binding of one peptide to the enzyme enhances the binding of the other peptide by about a factor of 2. Synergistic inhibition between PhK5 and PhK13 also indicates that phosphorylase kinase contains a distinct binding site for each peptide. Taken together with the data that both peptides are competitive inhibitors of phosphorylase b suggests that phosphorylase kinase may have two distinct binding sites for phosphorylase b. To better define the determinants in PhK5 and PhK13 critical for autoinhibitory function versus δ-subunit interaction, a series of truncated peptides was prepared and assayed for phosphorylase kinase inhibitory activity and calmodulin binding activity. Because standard solid-phase peptide synthesis proceeds from the carboxyl terminus toward the amino terminus of the peptide, a series of truncation peptides which share a common carboxyl terminus can be easily prepared by removing aliquots of peptide resin at different stages during the synthesis. Table 2 shows the sequences, calmodulin-binding affinity, estimated Ki for autoinhibition, and nomenclature for the eight peptides that were synthesized. The sequences of PhK5, PhK6, and PhK13 and their respective data are also presented in Table 2 for purposes of comparison. Because PhK5 and PhK6 exhibit similar Ki values for autoinhibition and similar affinities for calmodulin, it is reasonable to propose that the minimum essential determinants for autoinhibition and δ-subunit binding function for this regulatory subdomain would be contained in the sequence common to both peptides. This core sequence is represented by the peptide termed PhK6E which has the same amino terminus as PhK5 and the same carboxyl terminus as PhK6, but which lacks the carboxyl-terminal sequence of PhK5 (Gln-Gln-Gln-Asn-Arg) and the amino-terminal sequence of PhK6 (Tyr-Ala-Leu-Arg-Pro). The Ki value for autoinhibition with PhK6E is the same as that for PhK6 and approximately 50% higher than for PhK5, suggesting that the sequence Tyr-Ala-Leu-Arg-Pro (337-341) does not contain determinants essential for autoinhibition, whereas determinants in the sequence Gln-Gln-Gln-Asn-Arg (362-366) contribute modestly to the Ki value. With regard to its affinity for calmodulin, PhK6E binds calmodulin 5-fold weaker than PhK6 and 10-fold weaker than PhK5, suggesting that the sequences Tyr-Ala-Leu-Arg-Pro (337-341) and Gln-Gln-Gln-Asn-Arg (362-366) both contribute significantly to the interactions of the γ-subunit with the δ-subunit. The peptide PhK6D, which is two residues shorter at its amino terminus than PhK6E, had a Ki value for autoinhibition that was only about 30% greater than PhK6E, but bound calmodulin about 8-fold weaker, indicating that Leu-Arg (342-343) contributes significantly to δ-subunit binding, but is only marginally important for autoinhibition. Similar effects on affinity for calmodulin and Ki for autoinhibition were observed when the sequence Arg-Leu-Ile (344-346) was removed on going from PhK6D to PhK6C. The peptide PhK6B, which is three residues shorter than PhK6C, has no detectable autoinhibitory activity at concentrations as high as 50 μM, but still retains the ability to bind calmodulin with low affinity (KD = 20 μM). The peptide PhK6A, which is two residues shorter than PhK6B, has no detectable autoinhibitory activity or affinity for calmodulin. Thus, it appears that the sequence represented by PhK5 is the shortest sequence in the C-terminal regulatory domain of the γ-subunit with optimal autoinhibitory activity. The differences in affinity for calmodulin observed between PhK6 and PhK6E suggest that adding the sequence Tyr-Ala-Leu-Arg-Pro (337-341) to the amino terminus of PhK5 to form a 30-residue peptide (337-366) might increase the affinity for calmodulin above that seen with PhK5, but this idea has not been tested. The studies with peptides based on PhK13 included two truncated peptides that were shorter than PhK13 and one peptide that was one residue longer at its amino terminus than PhK13 (Table 2). The longer peptide PhK13C (301-326) had Arg301 added to its amino terminus and showed a 6.5-fold higher affinity for calmodulin than PhK13 and a Ki for autoinhibition that was 33% lower than for PhK13. These data suggest that this single Arg residue is important for both δ-subunit interactions and autoinhibition. Removing the six residue sequence Arg-Gly-Lys-Phe-Lys-Val (301-306) from the amino terminus of PhK13 resulted in a 10-fold decrease in affinity for calmodulin and less than a 2-fold increase in the Ki for autoinhibition relative to PhK13. Removing an additional five residues, Ile-Cys-Leu-Thr-Val (307-311), resulted in a 15-residue peptide (312-326) that had no detectable affinity for calmodulin and no detectable autoinhibitory activity. These data suggest that the sequence Ile-Cys-Leu-Thr-Val (307-311) is essential for both autoinhibition and δ-subunit interactions. Consistent with this proposal is the finding that all of the PhK peptides that contain this sequence (PhK12 through PhK16) have autoinhibitory and calmodulin binding activity, whereas peptides immediately flanking these peptides are lacking in both functional activities (Table 1). Using a library of overlapping synthetic peptides based on the regulatory domain of the γ-subunit of phosphorylase kinase, two distinct noncontiguous regions, residues 302-326 (PhK13) and 342-356 (PhK5), have been identified as being putative pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory domains. Peptides from each of these two regions inhibited catalytic activity of phosphorylase kinase competitively with respect to the phosphate acceptor substrate, phosphorylase b, and noncompetitively with respect to the phosphate donor substrate, Mg•ATP. Moreover, peptides from the two regions inhibited catalytic activity in a synergistic manner, indicating that both peptides can bind the γ-subunit at the same time. The inhibitory capacity of these peptides could be overcome by the addition of a molar excess of calmodulin, consistent with their previously being identified as calmodulin(δ-subunit)-binding domains(4Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This appears to be the first example of a calmodulin-regulated protein kinase with multiple noncontiguous synergistic autoinhibitory/calmodulin-binding subdomains. Reimann et al.(22Reimann E.M. Titani K. Ericsson L.H. Wade R.H. Fischer E.H. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4185-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) first suggested that the C-terminal 110 amino acids of the γ-subunit (residues 277-386) might constitute the regulatory domain of phosphorylase kinase. Subsequently, limited proteolysis (23Harris W.R. Malencik D.A. Johnson C.M. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Byles C.A. Anderson S.R. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Fischer E.H. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11740-11745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and genetically engineered truncation mutants(24Cox S. Johnson L.N. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Huang C.-Y.F. Yuan C.-J. Livanova N.B. Graves D.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 7-18Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) of the γ-subunit were used to show that residues 298-386 contain an autoinhibitory domain. The two putative autoinhibitory domain sequences identified in the present study, 302-326 (PhK13) and 342-356 (PhK5), are both located in this region of the γ-subunit. Neither of these sequences corresponds to the putative pseudosubstrate domain proposed by Kemp and Pearson (3Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) who suggested that residues 332-353 might represent the pseudosubstrate domain based upon inspection of the γ-subunit sequence. Moreover, the peptide containing this latter sequence, PhK7 (residues 332-356), showed virtually no inhibitory activity in the present study (Table 1). Because PhK5 and PhK13 act as competitive inhibitors of phosphorylase b, some sequence similarity between these peptides and phosphorylase might be expected. Sequence alignment of phosphorylase with PhK5 and PhK13 reveals that both peptides contain short stretches of sequence that closely resemble the sequence of phosphorylase (Fig. 4). The two regions of highest sequence similarity correspond closely to the regions required for substrate inhibitory activity based on the data shown in 1, 2. It is particularly noteworthy that a major portion of PhK13 shows sequence similarity with the sequence surrounding Ser14 in phosphorylase b, the phosphorylation site in phosphorylase b. The most significant sequence similarity between PhK13 (Lys303 to Arg323) and phosphorylase b (Lys9 to Lys29) spans 21 amino acids. This sequence is only found in its entirety in PhK13, the peptide with the lowest Ki value (0.3 μM) of the inhibitory peptides in the region spanning PhK12 through PhK16 (Table 1). The sequence Ile-Cys-Leu-Thr-Val appears to be especially important for inhibition because it is shared by all of the inhibitory peptides in this group and because truncation peptides based on PhK13 that lack this sequence are not inhibitory (Table 2). Interestingly, the corresponding pentapeptide from phosphorylase b is a competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of about 6 mM(26Graves D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and Ile-Ser-Val-Arg-Gly-Leu (phosphorylase b(13Kastenschmidt L.L. Kastenschmidt J. Helmreich E.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10274-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)) is the shortest synthetic peptide substrate that can be phosphorylated by phosphorylase kinase(16Tabatabai L.B. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2196-2202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other important determinants of substrate recognition (26Graves D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) which are identical in the alignment of PhK13 and phosphorylase b include Lys9(Lys303), Lys11(Lys305), Ile13(Ile307), and Leu18(Leu312). Using γ-subunit(1-300), a truncated form of the γ-subunit that lacks a regulatory domain, Huang et al.(27Huang C.-Y.F. Yuan C.-J. Blumenthal D.K. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7183-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that Glu111 and Glu154 are involved in binding peptide substrates at their P-3 and P-2 positions, respectively. Mutations of these residues increased the Ki value for PhK13 by 14- and 8-fold, respectively, indicating their involvement in binding PhK13, as well as peptide substrates. Thus, the sequence corresponding to PhK13 (residues 302-326) appears to represent a prototypical pseudosubstrate domain that regulates the catalytic activity of phosphorylase kinase by preventing the phosphorylation site of phosphorylase b access to the catalytic site. The ability of PhK5 to act as a competitive inhibitor of phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme (Fig. 1) and its sequence similarity to a region of phosphorylase b approximately 50 residues C-terminal to Ser14 (Fig. 4) suggest that phosphorylase b may have a major binding site on the holoenzyme in addition to the binding site that recognizes the sequence around Ser14 and that this secondary binding site is also involved in autoinhibition. The sequence in PhK5 showing the highest similarity to phosphorylase is Arg-Ile-Tyr-Gly-His-Trp-Val-Lys (residues 352-359) which aligns with His-Leu-Val-Gly-Arg-Trp-Ile-Arg (residues 62-69) in phosphorylase (Fig. 4). This sequence is shared by PhK4, PhK5, and PhK6, the only inhibitory peptides in this region of the γ-subunit (Table 1). It is interesting to note that Graves and co-workers have shown that synthetic peptides corresponding to the sequence of phosphorylase b around its phosphorylation site are poor substrates compared to the intact protein (26Graves D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that longer a CNBr fragment of phosphorylase b corresponding to residues 1-99 (16Tabatabai L.B. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2196-2202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) exhibited a Km value intermediate between that of the synthetic peptides and native phosphorylase b. The data obtained in the present study showing that PhK5 inhibits phosphorylase kinase activity synergistically with PhK13 (Fig. 3) provides further evidence that there are at least two distinct substrate binding sites for phosphorylase b and that both of these substrate binding sites might be used by autoinhibitory elements in the γ-subunit to regulate the catalytic activity of phosphorylase kinase. Inspection of the several x-ray crystal structures of phosphorylase (28Sprang S.R. Acharya K.R. Goldsmith E.J. Stuart D.I. Varvill K. Fletterick R.J. Madsen N.B. Johnson L.N. Nature. 1988; 336: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 29Johnson L.N. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) show that the phosphorylation site and the PhK5-like region of phosphorylase are relatively close to one another on the surface of the protein, adding support to the idea that these two regions of phosphorylase might be simultaneously involved in interactions with phosphorylase kinase. The kinetics of inhibition seen with PhK5 and PhK13 in the present study using phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme are in basic agreement with studies done using a γ-subunit truncation mutant, γ-subunit(1-300), which represents a minimal γ-subunit catalytic subunit that lacks calmodulin-binding and autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate domains(27Huang C.-Y.F. Yuan C.-J. Blumenthal D.K. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7183-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the studies with γ-subunit(1-300), PhK5 and PhK13 were both found to be potent inhibitors, although both PhK5 and PhK13 were slightly less potent (3-6-fold) inhibitors of γ-subunit(1-300) than the holoenzyme. The patterns of inhibition of PhK5 and PhK13 toward γ-subunit(1-300) were identical to those seen in the present study using holoenzyme, except that PhK5 was a noncompetitive inhibitor with regard to phosphorylase b (as compared to being a competitive inhibitor in the case of the holoenzyme) and a simple noncompetitive inhibitor with regard to ATP (as compared to being a mixed noncompetitive inhibitor of the holoenzyme). Because the γ-subunit(1-300) represents a minimal γ-subunit catalytic subunit that lacks the many inter- and intrasubunit interactions present in the holoenzyme, it is not unexpected that some differences in potency and patterns of inhibition might be observed for PhK5 and PhK13 between the two forms of the enzyme. In contrast to the findings of the present study, Newsholme et al.(30Newsholme P. Angelos K.L. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 810-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have concluded that neither PhK5 nor PhK13 are likely to represent pseudosubstrate domains because both peptides appeared to be noncompetitive inhibitors of phosphorylase b in their experiments. However, the kinetic data obtained by these investigators for PhK13 could not conclusively discriminate between competitive and noncompetitive inhibition because of problems of solubility at high peptide concentrations. No such solubility problems were encountered in the experiments described here or in other studies involving relatively high concentrations of PhK5 and PhK13(27Huang C.-Y.F. Yuan C.-J.

The differences in results obtained cannot be readily explained but might be due to differences in assay conditions or the quality of peptides used in the two studies. PhK5 in particular has several amino acids that are especially sensitive to incomplete side chain deprotection and modification during synthesis, cleavage, and purification. All of the peptides used in the present study were subjected to peptide sequence analysis, quantitative amino acid analysis, and UV spectral analysis. In addition to the two putative autoinhibitory domains in the γ-subunit, Sanchez and Carlson (32Sanchez V.E. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17889-17895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently reported that residues 420-436 in the β-subunit of phosphorylase kinase may constitute a potential autoinhibitory domain. The proposed sequence alignment relative to the phosphorylation site in phosphorylase b is shown in Fig. 4. Kinetic analysis of a synthetic peptide based on the β-subunit 420-436 sequence indicated a pattern of inhibition that was competitive with respect to phosphorylase b (Ki = 921 μM) and uncompetitive with respect to ATP using the δ-γ enzyme complex. How these various autoinhibitory domains might interact in the holoenzyme remains to be answered. One possibility is that each domain acts independently to inhibit phosphorylase b binding. Another possibility is that the domain on the β-subunit acts by inducing conformational changes in the regions corresponding to PhK5 and PhK13, which in turn alter catalytic activity. Elucidation of the precise mechanisms by which these various autoinhibitory domains effect changes in the enzymatic activity of phosphorylase kinase will require detailed structural studies involving a variety of approaches including the use of synthetic peptide analogs, site-directed mutagenesis, and x-ray crystallography. We are grateful to Dr. Mark A. L. Atkinson (The University of Texas Health Center at Tyler) for performing the peptide sequence analyses and to Dr. Barry Starcher (The University of Texas Health Center at Tyler) for performing the peptide amino acid analyses.

https://openalex.org/W1989617077,"The transcription factor USF1 belongs to the family of basic helix-loop-helix proteins that are involved in the regulation of various important cellular processes. Here we characterized the factors involved in the activation of transcription by upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) in a reconstituted class II gene transcription system. Activation of transcription by both wild type USF1 and a GAL-USF (amino acids 1-94 of the yeast activator protein GAL4 fused to amino acids 17-196 of USF) fusion protein required the presence of at least one positive cofactor. A novel positive cofactor (PC5) that functions specifically through the activation domain of USF1 was partially purified and biochemicaly distinguished from previously described positive cofactors. The mechanism by which PC5 mediates activation of transcription through USF1 was investigated in order-of-addition experiments. PC5 had to be present during binding of transcription factor (TF) IID to the TATA box to observe transcriptional activation. However, this event alone did not result in transcriptional activation, which also required the presence of the activator and of PC5 after binding of TFIID. Hence, PC5 may enter transcription during binding of TFIID to function in concert with the activator during subsequent steps in transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2110287903,"Trp-142 is a highly conserved residue of the cytochrome b subunit in the bc1 complexes. To study the importance of this residue in the quinol oxidation catalyzed by the bc1 complex, we characterized four yeast mutants with arginine, lysine, threonine, and serine at position 142. The mutant W142R was isolated previously as a respiration-deficient mutant unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (Lemesle-Meunier, D., Brivet-Chevillotte, P., di Rago, J.-P, Slonimski, P. P., Bruel, C., Tron, T., and Forget, N.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 15626-15632). The mutants W142K, W142T, and W142S were obtained here as respiration-sufficient revertants from mutant W142R. Mutant W142R exhibited a decreased complex II turnover both in the presence and absence of antimycin A; this suggests that the structural effect of W142R in the bc1 complex probably interferes with the correct assembly of the succinate-ubiquinone reductase complex. The mutations resulted in a parallel decrease in turnover number and apparent Km, with the result that there was no significant change in the second-order rate constant for ubiquinol oxidation. Mutants W142K and W142T exhibited some resistance toward myxothiazol, whereas mutant W142R showed increased sensitivity. The cytochrome cc1 reduction kinetics were found to be severely affected in mutants W142R, W142K, and W142T. The respiratory activities and the amounts of reduced cytochrome b measured during steady state suggest that the W142S mutation also modified the quinol-cytochrome c1 electron transfer pathway. The cytochrome b reduction kinetics through center P were affected when Trp-142 was replaced with arginine or lysine, but not when it was replaced with threonine or serine. Of the four amino acids tested at position 142, only arginine resulted in a decrease in cytochrome b reduction through center N. These findings are discussed in terms of the structure and function of the quinol oxidation site and seem to indicate that Trp-142 is not critical to the kinetic interaction of ubiquinol with the reductase, but plays an important role in the electron transfer reactions that intervene between ubiquinol oxidation and cytochrome c1 reduction.

The ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (the cytochrome bc1 complex; EC 1.10.2.2) is an integral multisubunit membrane protein that is involved in energy transduction in a wide range of organisms. All the bc1 complexes contain a minimum of three redox-active polypeptide subunits carrying four prosthetic groups: a[2Fe-2S]iron-sulfur protein, a one-heme center cytochrome c1, and a two-heme center apocytochrome b, cytochrome bL, and cytochrome bH(1Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hauska G. Hurt E. Gabellini N. Lockau W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 97-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This complex catalyzes the electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c coupled to a vectorial proton translocation through the membrane involving a mechanism known as the modified Q cycle(3Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 4Crofts A.R. Wraight Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 149-185Crossref Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 5Crofts A.R.

According to this mechanism, the bc1 complex transfers two electrons from ubiquinol to two molecules of cytochrome c with a concomitant ejection of two protons on the positive side of the membrane, while two additional protons are translocated from the negative to the positive side of the membrane per pair of electrons transferred. This mechanism requires two quinone separate independent reaction domains: the ubiquinol oxidation domain (QP center) located on the positive side of the membrane, which is the target of three groups of specific inhibitors, especially the methoxyacrylate-type inhibitor exemplified by myxothiazol (for review, see (8Link T.A. Haase U. Brandt U. von Jagow G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)), and the ubiquinone reduction domain (QN center) located on the negative side of the membrane, which is the target of other specific inhibitors exemplified by antimycin A (for review, see (8Link T.A. Haase U. Brandt U. von Jagow G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)). The QP center is associated with two proteins, the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome b through heme bL. Electrons from ubiquinol diverge at center P: one is transferred to the iron-sulfur protein, along with the production of an unstable semiquinone, and subsequently to cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c; the second electron is transferred to heme bL and thereafter to heme bH and is recycled through a quinone molecule to form a stable semiquinone anion at the quinone reductase domain. The oxidation of a second molecule of ubiquinol at center P is required to reduce this stable semiquinone into ubiquinol at center N. Another essential feature of the Q cycle mechanism is that cytochrome b can be reduced through two pathways, the center P pathway, which is the more thermodynamically favorable, and the center N pathway when the thermodynamically favorable route through center P is blocked. It has by now become generally accepted that cytochrome b is folded into an eight-transmembrane α-helix structure with a ninth extramembranous amphipathic helix. This model has been supported by hydrophobicity and amphipathy calculations(9Rao J.K.M. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 10Crofts A.R.

The assumption that a highly conserved residue performs a vital functional or structural role in the protein is often used in site-directed mutagenesis strategies. Recent results have shown, however, that only a few of the evolutionarily conserved amino acids seem to be essential for bc1 function(34Yun C.-H. Wang Z. Crofts A.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5901-5909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here on the mapping, sequencing, and biochemical study of four mutants: the inactive cytochrome b W142R mutant(26Lemesle-Meunier D. Brivet-Chevillotte P. di Rago J.-P. Slonimski P.P. Bruel C. Tron T. Forget N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15626-15632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mutation of which affects an evolutionarily conserved residue, and three functional revertants isolated from this mutant. According to degli Esposti et al.(38degli Esposti M. de Vries S. Crimi M. Ghelli A. Patarnello T. Meyer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 243-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), tryptophan at position 142 is conserved among the 800 cytochrome b sequences known to date, except in Paramecium aurelia and Bacillus PS3. Moreover, this position belongs to one of the most conserved regions of cytochrome b, spanning residues 131-148, which may interact with the QP center. The mutants/revertants were investigated regarding their effects on growth, various electron transfer activities, kinetic interaction between the substrate and the enzyme, cytochrome c1 reduction, cytochrome b reduction through both centers P and N, and resistance to inhibitors. The results suggest that Trp-142 is important to the properties of the quinol oxidation site, especially to the electron transfer reactions that occur between quinol oxidation and cytochrome c1 reduction. The parental control diploid strain KM91 was obtained by crossing the haploid strain 777-3A (α, ade1−, op1−, rho+, mit+) with the haploid KL14-4A/60 (a, his1−, trp2−, OP1+, rhoo). To select for point mutations in mitochondrial DNA and at the same time to counter-select large deletions in this genome, the op1− method was used(39Kotylac Z. Slonimski P.P. Saccone S. Kroon A.M. The Genetic Function of Mitochondrial DNA. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1976: 143-154Google Scholar). It is based on the following rationale. 1) the op1− nuclear mutation (40Kovac L. Lachowicz T.M. Slonimski P.P. Science. 1967; 158: 1564-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) abolishes the activity of the main ADP/ATP translocator of the mitochondrial membrane (the AAC2 translocator). 2) In the presence of the op1− mutation, the rho−/rhoo mutations, which result from large deletions of mitochondrial DNA(41Fayé G. Fukuhara H. Grandchamp C. Lazowska J. Michel F. Casey J. Getz G. Locker J. Rabinowitz M. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Coen D. Deutsch J. Dujon B. Netter P. Slonimski P.P. Biochimie (Pairs). 1973; 55: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), lead to an immediate cell lethality even on glucose media (42Kovacova V. Irmlerova J. Kovac L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 162: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and therefore are counter-selected. 3) This cellular lethality is due to a complete loss of mitochondrial protein synthesis in rho−/rhoo cells, which are always deficient in one or several elements of this machinery (rRNAs or tRNAs) and therefore cannot synthesize subunits 6 and 9 of the ATP synthase complex, while point mutations in cytochrome b or cytochrome oxidase genes do not abolish the synthesis of ATP synthase subunits and are viable on glucose-containing media. 4) Therefore, mutagenesis of the op1−rho+, mit+ cells gives only op1−rho+ survivors, with the op1−rho−/rhoo cells being dead. 5) To select among the survivors, the point mutations in the mitochondrial genome, a test cross is performed. The survivors (haploid) are crossed with the OP1+ rhoo haploids, and the diploids are selected on glucose media and tested for respiratory sufficiency on glycerol/ethanol media. The majority of the diploid clones are respiration-sufficient since the op1− mutation is complemented by the wild-type allele in OP1+/op1− heterozygous cells, and they do not carry any mitochondrial mutation, while only a minority carries a mitochondrial mit− mutation, which cannot be complemented by the OP1+ rhoo tester. Such haploid op1−mit−clones are isolated (the first list of mutants is given in (39Kotylac Z. Slonimski P.P. Saccone S. Kroon A.M. The Genetic Function of Mitochondrial DNA. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1976: 143-154Google Scholar)) and used for further studies. In this manner, the mutant 777-3A/V384 was isolated from the haploid strain 777-3A (α, ade1−, op1−, rho+, mit+) and then crossed with the strain KL14-4A/60 (a, his1−, trp2−, OP1+, rhoo), and the resulting diploid KM772 (α/a, op1−/OP1+, ade1−/ADE1+, HIS1+/his1−, TPR2+/trp2−, rho+, cob-V384) was constructed. It has the AAC2 ADP/ATP translocator, and its mitochondrial genome is homoplasmic for the W142R mutation in the cytochrome b gene. Revertants were isolated on glycerol medium (2% glycerol, 1% yeast extract, 1% Bacto-peptone) and characterized using procedures described previously (24di Rago J.-P. Netter P. Slonimski P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3332-3339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Media, growth conditions, and preparation of mitochondria were as described (41Fayé G. Fukuhara H. Grandchamp C.

Antimycin and myxothiazol were prepared in ethanol and added to final concentrations of 20 and 30 μM, respectively. KCN was added to a final concentration of 2 mM. Succinate was added to a final concentration of 40 mM. Reduction kinetics were recorded on an SLM-AMINCO DW2 spectrophotometer equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The myxothiazol I50 values measured in the W142K, W142T, and W142S revertants were determined as described(22Tron T. Lemesle-Meunier D. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). I50 represents the concentration of inhibitor that decreases the rate of DBH2-cytochrome c oxidoreductase by 50%. The action of myxothiazol on the mitochondria isolated from the W142R mutant was measured by inhibiting the cytochrome cc1 reduction kinetics recorded at 551-540 nm. The initial slope of the reaction was plotted against the inhibitor concentration, and the concentration that led to a 50% decrease in kinetics was referred to as the I50 value. The amount of cytochrome b was determined spectrally. Cytochrome b from complex II has the property of being oxidized by fumarate even in the presence of dithionite(26Lemesle-Meunier D.

The dithionite-reduced minus (dithionite + fumarate)-reduced absorbance spectra showed a peak centered at 562 nm, corresponding to the complex II cytochrome b. An absorption coefficient of 24 mM−1 cm−1 was used to calculate its concentration in each strain. The frequency of revertants from mutant W142R (TGA → AGA) was estimated to be 10−9. 67 revertants representing 34 genetically independent reversion events were analyzed. 38 (57%) were true back-mutants (Arg-142 → Trp (AGA → TGA)). Three different pseudo-reversions leading to different amino acid replacements at codon 142 were found: Arg-142 → Ser (AGA → AGT) in six genetically independent revertants, Arg-142 → Thr (AGA → ACA) in one revertant, and Arg-142 → Lys (AGA → AAA) in one revertant. Codon 142 belongs to a very short exon (B2) of only 14 base pairs(46Lazowska J. Jacq C. Slonimski P.P. Cell. 1980; 22: 333-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Part of this exon, including codon 142, is involved in base pairings with intron bi2, which are crucial to the splicing of this intron (see Fig. 5 in (47Tian G.-L. Michel S. Macadre C. Slonimski P.P. Lazowska J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 744-760Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). Not surprisingly, the mutants described above accumulated significant amounts of nonprocessed cytochrome b transcripts. Two other amino acids, Gly-142 (GGA) and Met-142 (ATA), could have been obtained by monosubstitution at the Arg-142 codon (AGA). Given the fact that they have not been found among the high number of revertants analyzed, it seems likely that the corresponding nucleotide changes would result in a respiration-negative phenotype. However, it is difficult to ascertain whether Gly-142 and Met-142 are not compatible with the function of cytochrome b or whether the corresponding nucleotide changes impair splicing of cytochrome b pre-mRNA. Also, the serine codon AGC could have been derived by a single nucleotide change from the Arg-142 codon. Since the presence of serine at position 142 gives a functional cytochrome b, one could infer that this codon blocks the splicing of intron bi2. However, this codon is normally not used by yeast mitochondria for the synthesis of respiratory and phosphorylating complexes(48Bonitz S.G. Coruzzi G. Thalenseld B.E. Tzagaloff A. Macino G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11927-11941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that it has not been found among the revertants we analyzed. The absorbance spectra of mitochondria isolated from the parental and W142R, W142K, W142T, and W142S mutant strains are shown in Fig. 1. The ascorbate minus ferricyanide spectrum (bottom trace in each panel) shows the high potential c-type cytochrome (c + c1) reduction. The succinate minus ascorbate spectrum (middle traces in panels A and C-E) shows the reduction of the high potential heme bH. The succinate minus ferricyanide spectrum (middle trace in panel B) shows the reduction of heme bH; indeed, in the presence of succinate, neither cytochrome cc1 nor cytochrome oxidase is reduced in mutant W142R, which indicates that no electron transfer occurs between cytochrome b and cytochrome cc1 in this mutant. Adding a few grains of dithionite to the sample reduced the low potential heme bL and the complex II cytochrome b, which is totally oxidized by a subsequent addition of fumarate(45Hatefi Y. Galante Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5530-5537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the dithionite plus fumarate minus succinate spectrum (top trace in each panel) shows the low potential heme bL reduction. A decrease in the synthesis of all the cytochromes is usually observed in respiration-deficient strains, which use only ATP produced by fermentation for their growth. In some mutants, this decrease is in approximately the same proportion as that observed in their counterparts in the parental strain(22Tron T. Lemesle-Meunier D. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the results presented here, mutant W142R exhibits a greater decrease in the reduced heme bL than in the reduced heme bH or cytochrome cc1. All the revertants recovered a level of cytochrome synthesis similar to that in the parental strain (80-100%). Mutant W142R did not grow on respiratory substrates and exhibited no quinol-cytochrome c reductase activity (Table 1) and no oxygen consumption when ethanol, NADH, or succinate was used as substrate. Revertants W142K, W142T, and W142S recovered 12, 46, and 83% of the parental bc1 complex activity, respectively (Table 1); a similar recovery was observed in their various oxidase activities. All the mutant strains exhibited an NADH-DB reductase activity identical to that of the parental strain, whereas the succinate-DB oxidoreductase activity was severely affected in mutant W142R and only slightly modified (if at all) in the revertant strains. Revertant W142S grew on nonfermentable carbon sources with the same characteristics as the parental strain, whereas revertants W142K and W142T exhibited very low growth rates under these growth conditions: 1.2 and 4.5% of the parental counterpart, respectively.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab DBH2-cytochrome c reductase activity was titrated with myxothiazol and antimycin A in the parental and revertant strains. In the presence of myxothiazol, the I50 values showed that 10- and 5-fold increases in resistance toward this inhibitor occurred with revertants W142K and W142T, respectively, whereas no change in myxothiazol sensitivity was observed with revertant W142S. Mutant W142R did not exhibit any DBH2-cytochrome c reductase activity, but exhibited cytochrome c1 reduction during a single turnover of the bc1 complex (see “Reduction Kinetics of the bc1 Complex Cytochomes”). This finding was used to assay the sensitivity of this mutant toward myxothiazol; a 4-fold higher sensitivity was observed in comparison with the parental strain. The sensitivity toward antimycin was not modified by mutation W142K, W142T, or W142S (data not shown), and it was previously observed that mutation W142R does not affect the antimycin sensitivity either(49Chevillotte-Brivet P. Meunier-Lemesle D. Forget N. Pajot P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The bc1 complex steady-state electron transfer mechanism can be described as a ping-pong two-site scheme in which ubiquinol and cytochrome c interact with two catalytically independent sites(50Speck S.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1064-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51degli Esposti M. Lenaz G. Arch. Biochem.

The experimental Vmax/Km = kmin value (with Vmax expressed as the turnover number) gives the apparent second-order rate constant characteristic of the arrival and binding of the substrate to its site. This is valid as long as these steps are not rate-limiting, which is the case in the strains studied here since they all exhibited Michaelis-type kinetic behavior. The results given in Table 2 indicate that all the revertants exhibit similar close kmin valu"
https://openalex.org/W2012245216,"We previously showed that two subpopulations of asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGP-Rs), designated State 1 and State 2 ASGP-Rs, are present in intact cells and that State 2 ASGP-Rs can be inactivated in permeable rat hepatocytes in a temperature- and ATP-dependent manner. These inactivated ASGP-Rs can be quantitatively reactivated by the addition of palmitoyl-CoA (Weigel, P. H., and Oka, J. A.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 27186-27190). Here we show that ~50% of purified rat ASGP-Rs are inactivated by treatment with hydroxylamine under mild conditions. The activity of affinitypurified ASGP-Rs was assessed by measuring the specific binding of 125I-asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR) in a dot-blot assay after immobilization onto nitrocellulose. Treatment of ASGP-Rs in solution with 0.0125-1.0 M NH2OH, pH 7.4, at 4°C for 4 h resulted in a progressive loss of ASOR binding activity. ASGP-R inactivation with NH2OH occurred more readily at basic pH or at room temperature. Similar treatment with Tris had no effect on ASGP-R activity. The kinetics of ASGP-R activity loss and the dose-response for this inactivation were both biphasic, indicating the presence of two equal populations of ASGP-Rs with different sensitivities to NH2OH. The more sensitive population of ASGP-Rs (~50%) was inactivated by treatment with 0.2 M NH2OH (4°C, 4 h) or with 1.0 M NH2OH (4°C, 1 h) without detectable peptide cleavage as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. State 1 ASGP-Rs, purified from chloroquine- or monensin-treated hepatocytes, showed significantly less sensitivity to NH2OH treatment (both in kinetics and dose dependence). Furthermore, under mild conditions NH2OH caused dissociation and inactivation of ~50% of the total ASGP-Rs (State 1 and State 2) that were prebound to ASOR-Sepharose, whereas the same treatment caused dissociation of only <20% of State 1 ASGP-Rs from such preformed complexes. As shown in the accompanying paper (Zeng, F. Y., Kaphalia, B. S., Ansari, G. A. S., and Weigel, P. H.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 21382-21387) all three RHL subunits of active ASGP-Rs, in fact, contain covalently attached palmitate and stearate. In cultured cells, [3H]palmitic acid is metabolically incorporated into all three subunits. These radiolabeled fatty acids are completely released from purified ASGP-Rs by mild NH2OH treatment. We conclude that the NH2OH-sensitive subpopulation of ASGP-Rs corresponds to the previously described State 2 ASGP-Rs and that these receptors require fatty acylation for their ligand binding activity.

https://openalex.org/W2051937514,"Rat hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGP-Rs) are hetero-oligomers composed of three homologous glycoprotein subunits, designated rat hepatic lectins (RHL) 1, 2, and 3. ASGP-Rs mediate the endocytosis and degradation of circulating glycoconjugates containing terminal N-acetylgalactosamine or galactose, including desialylated plasma glycoproteins. We have shown in permeable rat hepatocytes that the ligand binding activity of one subpopulation of receptors (designated State 2 ASGP-Rs) can be decreased or increased, respectively, by ATP and palmitoyl-CoA (Weigel, P. H., and Oka, J. A.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 27186-27190). We proposed that a reversible and cyclic acylation/deacylation process may regulate ASGP-R activity during endocytosis, receptor-ligand dissociation, and receptor recycling. In the accompanying paper (Zeng, F-Y., and Weigel, P. H.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 21388-21395), we show that the ligand binding activity of affinity-purified State 2 ASGP-Rs is decreased by treatment with hydroxylamine under mild conditions consistent with these ASGP-Rs being fatty acylated in vivo. In this study, we used a chemical method to determine the presence of covalently-bound fatty acids in individual ASGP-R subunits. The affinity-purified ASGP-R preparations were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, and the gel slices containing individual RHL subunits were treated with alkali to release covalently bound fatty acids, which were subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography and confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both stearic and palmitic acids were detected in all three receptor subunits. Pretreatment of ASGP-Rs with hydroxylamine before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reduced the content of both fatty acids by 66-80%, indicating that most of these fatty acids are attached to cysteine residues via thioester linkages. Furthermore, when freshly isolated hepatocytes were cultured in the presence of [3H]palmitate, all three RHL subunits in affinity-purified ASGP-Rs were metabolically labeled. We conclude that RHL1, RHL2, and RHL3 are modified by fatty acylation in intact cells.

We conclude that RHL1, RHL2, and RHL3 are modified by fatty acylation in intact cells. Covalent binding of long chain saturated fatty acids occurs with a wide variety of membrane proteins post-translationally and significantly influences protein localization and/or function(1James G. Olsen E.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2623-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Two of the most common modifications involve acylation with myristate and palmitate. Myristate is usually attached to an N-terminal glycine via an amide bond in a relatively stable linkage. In contrast, palmitate is attached either to cysteine residues via a thioester bond or to serine residues via an ester bond; both linkages, particularly the thioester, are hydrolyzed by alkali treatment(2Towler D.A.

The amino acid sequences of all three subunits are closely related, and they are the products of two different genes(8Drickamer K. Kidney Int. 1987; 32: 167-180Google Scholar). RHL1 is the major subunit of the ASGP-R, while RHL2 and RHL3, encoded by the same gene, are minor subunits and differ only in the type and amount of post-translational carbohydrate modification(9Holland E.C.

In intact cells, the State 2 ASGP-Rs undergo a transient inactivation/reactivation cycle during receptor recycling (11McAbee D.D. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1942-1945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This same cycle has been successfully reconstituted in permeable rat hepatocytes(12Medh J.D. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

These above results suggest that one or all ASGP-R subunits are modified by fatty acylation in vivo and that a reversible acylation/deacylation process may be involved in regulating the ligand-binding activity of ASGP-Rs as they function during receptor mediated endocytosis. In this study, we have used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to examine directly whether total (State 1 plus State 2) ASGP-Rs contain covalently-bound fatty acids. The results demonstrate that all three ASGP-R subunits contain covalently-linked palmitate and stearate. Treatment of each RHL subunit with hydroxylamine under mild conditions released both fatty acids in relatively large amounts, indicating that most fatty acids are attached via thioester linkages.

SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli(20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The samples were mixed with an equal volume of a 2-fold concentrated sample buffer containing 125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS (w/v), 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Samples were not boiled in order to minimize the possibility of ester hydroylsis. The samples were then resolved by electrophoresis on 10% (w/v) acrylamide slab gels (10 × 8 cm, Bio-Rad mini-gel apparatus) in the presence of 0.1% SDS. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (1 mg/ml in 5% acetic acid, 25% methanol) for 5 min, and then destained with 5% acetic acid, 25% methanol until protein bands were clearly visible. To determine if hydroxylamine treatment releases covalently-bound fatty acids, the purified ASGP-R preparation was incubated with 1 M hydroxylamine or 1 M Tris (as a control) at pH 7.4 on ice for 2 h before the addition of sample buffer and SDS-PAGE. All glassware was new and thoroughly rinsed with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) prior to use. HPLC-grade water was used throughout the procedure. Affinity-purified ASGP-R (400 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE, and after staining and destaining as described above, RHL1, RHL2, and RHL3 bands were cut from the gel, minced into small pieces, and placed into 15 × 100-mm screw-cap vials. Controls with same size of blank gel or gel pieces containing 100 μg of BSA were treated identically and placed in separate vials. The minced gel pieces were sequentially washed with 10 ml of water twice for 4 h each, 10 ml of 90% methanol, 10% water three times over 12 h, and 10 ml of 50% methanol in water twice for 8 h. The final wash was removed and the gel pieces were then treated with 2.5 ml of methanol/chloroform/water (2.5:1.25:1, v/v/v) twice each for 10 min. These extracts were pooled, transferred into a new vial, and water (1.0 ml) and chloroform (1.5 ml) were added. The contents were mixed vigorously and the biphasic solution was then allowed to separate. The chloroform phase was transferred to a new vial and dried under nitrogen gas. To release ester-linked fatty acids from the RHL proteins, the minced gel pieces were dried under nitrogen after the final wash and 0.7 ml of 1.5 N NaOH was added to each vial. After shaking at 30°C for 3 h, the vials were cooled on ice and then neutralized with 0.3 ml of 6 N HCl. To each vial, 4.0 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) was added, and the vials were shaken at room temperature for 10 min. The chloroform/methanol extract was transferred to another new vial, each gel was washed with 1.5 ml of chloroform, and the wash was combined with each extraction. Water (1 ml) was added to each vial to obtain a two-phase solution, and the chloroform phase was transferred to a clean new vial and dried under nitrogen. The gels were also dried under nitrogen. To hydrolyze amide-linked fatty acids, the dried, minced gel pieces were incubated with 1.0 ml of 6 N HCl at 110°C for 6 h in Teflon-lined screw-capped vials. After cooling to room temperature, 4.0 ml of methanol/chloroform (1:1) was added and the vials were shaken for 10 min. The extract was transferred to a new vial, the gel pieces were washed with 1.5 ml of chloroform, and this wash was added to the extract solution. Two phases were formed by addition of 1 ml of water and after vigorous mixing followed by phase separation the chloroform layer was transferred to a clean vial and dried under nitrogen. Fatty acids were derivatized to their corresponding methyl esters. BF3-methanol (0.5 ml) was added to each vial containing dried extracts, and the vial was flushed with nitrogen, capped, and incubated at 50°C for 30 min. The vials were cooled to room temperature and 0.5 ml of water and 2 ml of hexane were added. After mixing and a brief centrifugation, the upper hexane layer was transferred to a clean conical bottom screw-top vial. The aqueous phase was extracted again with 2.0 ml of hexane, which was removed, combined with the first upper phase, and dried under nitrogen. The dried residue was dissolved in 200 μl of pesticide-grade hexane and the fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Gas Chromatograph with a DB 225 fused silica capillary column (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA; 20 m long, 0.2 mm film thickness, under split mode) and flame ionization detector (21Kaphalia B.S. Carr J.B. Ansari G.A.S. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The temperature of the injector port and detector was set at 200 and 300°C, respectively. Ultra high purity grade nitrogen, used as carrier gas at a flow rate 0.5 ml/min, was passed through molecular sieve (4 Å) and silica gel in order to remove the impurities of oxygen and moisture, respectively. The fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed using a thermal gradient from an initial column temperature of 150°C to a final temperature of 225°C with an increase of 10°C/min. The peak area of the fatty acid methyl esters was determined using the Hewlett-Packard 3396A integrator and the fatty acid methyl esters were quantitated by comparison to the response of known standards of fatty acid methyl esters. To confirm the identity of the fatty acids, fatty acid methyl esters were also analyzed by GC-MS using a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph interfaced with a Fennigan Incos-50 mass spectrometer at the Analytical Chemistry Center, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX. The esters were separated on a DB 23 column (30 m long, 0.32-mm inner diameter) using a temperature gradient from 100 to 250°C with an increase of 10°C/min and then analyzed by electron impact (70 eV), as well as by chemical ionization (using methane as reagent gas) mass spectrometry. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were plated onto 60-mm dishes (~2 × 106 cells/dish) and cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in William's Medium E as described previously(17Clarke B.L. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17384-17392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mML-glutamine, 50 milliunits/ml insulin, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 nM dexamethasone. For labeling experiments, cells were preincubated with medium without fetal calf serum at 37°C for 1 h. The labeling was then carried out in the medium containing 400 μCi of [3H]palmitic acid and 10% fetal calf serum (dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline). The active ASGP-Rs from radiolabeled cells were purified by affinity chromatogrphy using asialo-orosomucoid-Sepharose as described in (15Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and separated by SDS-PAGE as described above. The gel pieces containing 3H-labeled RHL1 were excised, and extensively washed with methanol/water (1:1, v/v) and chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) sequentially until no radioactivity was detected in the wash. Gel peices were dried under nitrogen gas and incubated with 0.35 ml of 1.5 N NaOH at 30°C for 3 h. After cooling on ice, 0.15 ml of 6 N HCl was added, the released fatty acids were recovered by extracting twice with 2 ml of hexane. The hexane phases were pooled and dried under nitrogen gas. The samples were redissolved in 50 μl of methanol. To identify radioactive fatty acids, 100 μg each of unlabeled myristic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid were added as carrier and internal standards. Samples were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC with a Vydac RP-300 C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm), eluted with acetonitrile/water (47:3, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and monitored at 205 nm using a Shimadzo SPD-10A UV-Vis detector. The radioactivity in eluted fractions (1 ml) was determined using a Packard Tri-carb 2300TR liquid scintillation analyzer. The retention times of the radioactive peaks were compared with those of the standard fatty acids. The protein content was measured by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using BSA as standard. Western blotting was carried out as described elsewhere, using subunit-specific antibodies(23Herzig M.C.S. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For fluorography, the fixed gel was washed with water for 30 min, and then soaked in fluoro-HANCE solution at room temperature for 30 min, dried at 60-70°C, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70°C for 25 days. Fatty acids can be covalently attached to proteins either to glycine residues via N-linked amide bonds, to cysteine residues via thioester bonds, or to serine residues via hydroxyester bonds(1James G. Olsen E.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2623-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glasser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The thioester and hydroxyester linkages are labile to alkaline treatment. To determine if the ASGP-R is modified by fatty acylation, we used a direct chemical method to assess whether any of the ASGP-R subunits contain covalently bound fatty acids. Freshly purified ASGP-R, prepared from isolated rat hepatocytes by affinity chromatography, was examined immediately, since storage resulted in activity loss and potential deacylation as noted in the accompanying paper(15Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that reducing agents such as β-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol may release some covalently-bound fatty acids, SDS-PAGE was carried out under nonreducing conditions and the samples were not boiled. Gel pieces containing the separated subunits RHL1, RHL2, and RHL3 were cut out, and subjected to extensive washing, extraction, and alkaline or acid hydrolysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The released fatty acids were derivatized to their methyl esters and analyzed by GC-MS. To assess the reliability of this method, we determined the optimal conditions for the washing steps, the alkali treatment to release ester-linked fatty acids, and the derivatization of fatty acids to their methyl esters. This was necessary in order to remove SDS and other components that could give contaminating GC peaks. In particular, we found that (i) extensive washing of the gel pieces with water and then methanol/water and (ii) performing the methanolysis with BF3-methanol at <60°C were both critical in order to reduce the background of observed GC peaks. A blank gel of the same size was used as negative control. Using our final conditions, this negative control gave small, but detectable peaks at positions corresponding to methyl palmitate and methyl stearate. The intensities of these peaks were very similar, if not identical, to those shown in the left panels of Fig. 1. These background peaks were present even in gels on which no samples had been loaded and could not be eliminated by changing the experimental conditions. The intensities of these peaks were also significantly increased by increasing the gel size analyzed (data not shown). For this reason, we used the same size blank or subunit-containing gels (verified by weight) to minimize the effect of differing gel size on the results. To verify that SDS-PAGE and the washing procedure after SDS-PAGE could effectively remove noncovalently bound fatty acids, BSA which is known to contain many kinds of noncovalently bound fatty acids, was subjected to the same procedure. The result showed no detectable fatty acids in either the chloroform/methanol wash or the alkaline hydrolyzate in comparison with a blank gel (not shown), indicating that SDS-PAGE and the subsequent wash procedures (before alkali treatment) completely removed noncovalently bound fatty acids. The analysis of alkaline hydrolysates of purified ASGP-R by GC-MS clearly demonstrated the presence of palmitate and stearate in each of the three RHL subunits (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). One GC peak in these samples was identified as the methyl ester of palmitate by two criteria: First, its retention time (11.65 min) on gas chromatography was identical to that of standard methyl palmitate and this peak co-chromatographed with the standard methyl palmitate. Second, mass spectrometric analysis of this GC peak (retention time = 11.65 min) gave a molecular ion (m/z = 270), which is the expected mass of methyl palmitate. Furthermore, additional ion mass peaks at 74 (McLafferty ion), 87, and 143, are the expected major molecular fragment ions from the methyl esters of saturated fatty acids. The mass spectrum of the 11.65-min peak was identical to that of the standard methyl palmitate (Fig. 2A). The methyl ester of stearate was identified by the same criteria. All samples contained a GC peak with a retention time of 13.86 min, identical to that of standard methyl stearate, and GC-MS analysis revealed a molecular ion (m/z = 298) and other major ions characteristic (21Kaphalia B.S. Carr J.B. Ansari G.A.S. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 24Murphy R.C. Snyder F. Handbook of Lipid Research. Plenum Press, New York1993: 290Google Scholar) of the methyl ester of stearate (Fig. 2B). In addition to methyl palmitate and methyl stearate, small amounts of the methyl esters of myristic, oleic, and linoleic acids were also detected by GC in the alkaline hydrolyzates of all three subunits (Fig. 1). Palmitate and stearate methyl esters were not detected in the chloroform/methanol wash of the gels containing ASGP-R subunits (Fig. 1, left panel). These esters were only found after processing the alkaline hydrolysates. After alkali treatment, the incubation of the gels containing receptor subunits with strong acid should release amide-linked fatty acids. The analysis of the acid hydrolysates of RHL1 and RHL2 by GC showed no detectable methyl esters of any fatty acid above background (data not shown), indicating the absence of amide-linked fatty acids in these two receptors subunits. RHL3, however, gave significant amounts of palmitate and stearate (≥6 times background). To determine if palmitate and stearate are attached to Cys residues of the receptor subunits via thioester linkages, the affinity-purified ASGP-Rs were treated prior to SDS-PAGE with hydroxylamine under mild conditions. Total ASGP-R was first treated with NH2OH, and then each RHL subunit was purified by SDS-PAGE and treated with alkali (Table 1). Quantitation of the released fatty acids showed that hydroxylamine treatment released 73, 100, and 68% of the methyl palmitate that could be detected in RHL1, RHL2, and RHL3, respectively. Similarly, for methyl stearate 74, 100, and 79% of this fatty acid detectable in RHL1, RHL2 and RHL3, respectively, was released by NH2OH treatment. Tris treatment had no significant effect on any of the RHL subunits (Table 1). These results indicate that most (>70%) of the covalently bound fatty acids in an alkali-labile linkage are attached to each RHL subunit via thioester-linkages to Cys.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Taking the molar ratio of the subunits (RHL1:RHL2:RHL3 ≈ 4:1:1) into account and assuming comparable yields, RHL2 and RHL3 contain about 4-5 times more covalently bound fatty acids than RHL1 (Table 1). Although the stoichiometries of fatty acids per RHL subunit have not been determined, these relative results were very similar in three independent experiments (Table 1). To confirm the above biochemical analyses, metabolic labeling experiments were performed to assess the incorporation of radiolabeled fatty acids into ASGP-R in intact hepatocytes. After cells were cultured in the presence of [3H]palmitate for 16 h, ASGP-Rs were affinity-purified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. All three RHL subunits were labeled with [3H]palmitate, although RHL1 had significantly more radioactivity than either RHL2 or RHL3 (Fig. 3). To verify that the 3H radioactivity represents palmitate, RHL1 was isolated, treated with alkali, and the hydrolysate was analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 4). The majority (81%) of the released radoactivity comigrated with authentic palmitate confirming that this fatty acid was covalently incorporated into ASGP-Rs in vivo. The remaining radioactivity which migrated as small alkyl fragments (probably C2-C10) could be derived in part from O-acetylated sialic acids on RHL1. Similar metabolic labeling experiments using [3H]stearate or [3H]myristate did not show detectable incorporation of these fatty acids into any of the RHL subunits of affinity-purified ASGP-R (not shown). Ongoing experiments indicate that the human ASGP-R is also metabolically labeled when HepG2 or HuH7 cells are cultured in the presence of [3H]palmitic acid. 2F-Y. Zeng, J. A. Oka, and P. H. Weigel, manuscript in preparation. Figure 4:Metabolically labeled RHL1 contains authentic [3H]palmitate. Hepatocytes were cultured with [3H]palmitate, and radiolabeled ASGP-Rs were purified and separated by SDS-PAGE. RHL1-containing bands were excised, and subjected to extensive wash, alkali treatment, and extraction of released fatty acids. The hydrolysate was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The retention times for co-chromatographed myristic acid (C14), palmitic acid (C16), and stearic acid (C18) are marked by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A number of diverse proteins including viral proteins(25Schmidt M.F.G.

Palmitoylation has been suggested to play an important functional role in many proteins. For example, the palmitoylation of subunits of G proteins is involved both in membrane attachment as well as in modulating signaling capability (32Linder M.E. Middleton P. Helper J.R. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3675-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 33Grassie M.A. McCallum J.F. Parrenti M. Magee A.I. Milligan G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 499Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of the neuronal growth cone protein GAP-43 reduces its ability to catalyze nucleotide exchange on a G protein (34Sudo Y. Valenzuela D. Beck-Sickenger A.G. Fishman M.C. Strittmatter S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2095-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Many investigators have shown that palmitoylation/depalmitoylation of a variety of proteins is a dynamic process(3Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23769-23772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the present study shows for the first time that ASGP-Rs are fatty acylated, Stockert 3R. A. Stockert, personal communication. found evidence over 10 years ago that [3H]palmitate might be incorporated into the human ASGP-R. Our results here clearly demonstrate that all three subunits of the ASGP-R are modified by fatty acylation. The GC-MS analysis shows the presence of both palmitate and stearate in each RHL subunit. The results from the GC-MS analyses were confirmed by the finding that all three subunits of the ASGP-R are metabolically labeled by [3H]palmitic acid. Initial metabolic labeling studies with [3H]stearate did not show incorporation into ASGP-Rs, although [3H]palmitate was readily incorporated. In earlier studies, however, stearyl-CoA was as effective as palmitoyl-CoA in being able to reactivate State 2 ASGP-Rs that had been inactivated by ATP treatment of permeable cells(13Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27186-27190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, as shown in Table 1and the accompanying paper(15Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the sensitivity of fatty acid release by hydroxylamine treatment at neutral pH is indicative of a thioester linkage. Pretreatment with hydroxylamine released approximately 66-100% of the stearate or palmitate in RHL1, RHL2, and RHL3 that could be released by alkaline hydrolysis. Therefore, ≥66% of the covalently bound fatty acids in alkali-labile linkages is probably present as thioesters. This percentage could actually be significantly greater if any fatty acyl migration occurs during receptor purification. Some thioesters could react with nucleophilic -NH2 or -OH groups in proximal amino acids to produce amide-linked or esterified fatty acids. This may explain why virtually all of the metabolically incorporated [3H]palmitate is released by mild NH2OH treatment (15Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and, therefore, presumably present exclusively as thioesters. The GC-MS and metabolic labeling results show apparent differences in the extent of RHL subunit fatty acylation, the fatty acids involved and the proportion of thioester linkages. It is premature to consider these differences significant, since the two methods are so different and each has inherent biases. For example, chemical analysis of purified total receptor should represent a steady-state incorporation of fatty acids mediated by every acylating and deacylation enzyme that recognizes ASGP-Rs from every part of the receptor trafficking pathway. Multiple cellular sites of modification (e.g. cell surface, endosome, or vesicles recycling back to the surface) and multiple fatty acylation sites within the ASGP-R likely make the overall modification pattern and process very complicated. Metabolic labeling studies, which are frequently not at a steady-state, can preferentially identify the fastest fatty acylation step for newly synthesized molecules or a site(s) of the most rapid fatty acyl turnover. More extensive studies will be required to characterize these processes in intact cells. The cytoplasmic domains of each RHL subunit have a single Cys residue within 5 amino acids of the transmembrane domain, which is a likely site for fatty acylation. The same position in the transferrin receptor is palmitoylated(30Alvarez E. Girones N. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16644-16655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Omary M.B. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4715-4718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jing S.Q. Trowbridge I.S. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Studies are in progress to determine the site(s) of modification in the three RHL subunits. The three ASGP-R subunits are known to have different extents of glycosylation(9Holland E.C. Leung J.O. Drickamer K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7338-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and are also differentially modified by phosphorylation in their cytoplasmic domains(36Takahashi T. Nakada H. Okumura T. Sawamura T. Tashiro Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 126: 1054-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 37Haynes P.A. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 33146-33151Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Our present results strongly suggest that the three subunits are also modified by fatty acylation to different extents. Thus, in the steady-state situation, all RHL subunits contain palmitate and stearate in similar ratios, but the amount of these two fatty acids in RHL1 is smaller than in RHL2 and RHL3. We report in the accompanying paper (15Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that treatment of radiolabeled affinity-purified ASGP-Rs with hydroxylamine completely removes the [3H]palmitic acid from RHL1, RHL2, and RHL3. The metabolic labeling experiments indicate that, in fact, only the State 2 ASGP-Rs (one of two receptor subpopulations that we have previously characterized) are palmitoylated and the vast majority of fatty acylation is via thioester bonds. One population of ASGP-Rs (the State 2 ASGP-Rs) undergoes a transient inactivation-reactivation cycle during receptor recycling(6Weigel P.H. Allen H.J. Kisailus E.C. Mechanisms and Control of Glycoconjugate Turnover. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 421-494Google Scholar, 11McAbee D.D. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

Such an inactivation-reactivation cycle may provide a biological basis for the high efficiency of the ligand-receptor segregation step in this and in other recycling receptor systems(6Weigel P.H. Allen H.J. Kisailus E.C. Mechanisms and Control of Glycoconjugate Turnover. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 421-494Google Scholar). That fatty acyl-CoAs can regulate ASGP-R activity in permeable hepatocytes(13Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27186-27190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Weigel P.H. Medh J.D. Oka J.A. Mol. Biol. 1994; 5: 227-235Google Scholar), suggests that a reversible fatty acylation-deacylation process could be the molecular basis of the State 2 receptor inactivation-reactivation cycle. The finding that one population of purified ASGP-Rs is selectively inactivated by hydroxylamine treatment, under mild conditions that releases essentially all of the covalently associated fatty acids,(15Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), supports this hypothesis. Thus, we conclude that the three ASGP-R subunits are modified by palmitate and stearate, and that acylation-deacylation of the ASGP-R could directly regulate its activity. An important point about the fatty acylation results presented here is that we analyzed the total active ASGP-R pool, which contains both State 1 and State 2 receptors. It is likely that the State 1 ASGP-Rs are not fatty acylated; fatty acylation may occur exclusively in the State 2 ASGP-R population(15Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21388-21395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2084060700,"The pH dependence of static optical/EPR spectra of trimethylamine dehydrogenase reduced to the level of two equivalents (TMADH2eq) has been examined and indicates the existence of three different states for this iron-sulfur flavoprotein. At pH 6, TMADH2eq exists principally in a form possessing flavin mononucleotide hydroquinone, with its iron-sulfur center oxidized. At pH 8, the enzyme principally contains flavin mononucleotide semiquinone and reduced iron-sulfur, but despite the proximity of the two centers to one another, their magnetic moments do not interact. At pH 10, TMADH2eq exhibits the EPR spectrum that is diagnostic of a previously characterized spin-interacting state in which the magnetic moments of the flavin semiquinone and reduced iron-sulfur center are strongly ferromagnetically coupled. The kinetics of the interconversion of these three states have been investigated using a pH jump technique in both H2O and D2O. The observed kinetics are consistent with a reaction mechanism involving sequential protonation/deprotonation and intramolecular electron transfer events. All reactions studied show a normal solvent kinetic isotope effect. Proton inventory analysis indicates that at least one proton is involved in the reaction between pH 6 and 8, which principally controls intramolecular electron transfer, whereas at least two protons are involved between pH 8 and 10, which principally control formation of the spin-interacting state. The results of these and previous studies indicate that for TMADH2eq, between pH 10 and 6, at least three protonation/deprotonation events are associated with intramolecular electron transfer and formation of the spin-interacting state, with estimated pKavalues of 6.0, 8.0, and ∼9.5. These pKa values are attributed to the flavin hydroquinone, flavin semiquinone, and an undesignated basic group on the protein, respectively.

Huang and R. Hille, unpublished results. Intramolecular transfer of reducing equivalents from FMN to the iron-sulfur center thus appears to be a necessary step in the catalytic cycle. Full reduction of trimethylamine dehydrogenase requires the uptake of three reducing equivalents, two for full reduction of the FMN, and the third for reduction of the iron-sulfur center. When reduced to the level of two equivalents/active site, an equilibrium distribution of reducing equivalents between the two centers exists, which is dictated by the relative reduction potentials of the FMN and 4Fe/4S center. Two possible electron distributions within the enzyme reduced by only two equivalents (TMADH2eq) exist: 1) flavin hydroquinone and oxidized iron-sulfur center and 2) flavin semiquinone and reduced iron-sulfur center. The latter distribution has been seen with trimethylamine dehydrogenase reduced by excess substrate, with enzyme reduced by sodium dithionite in the presence of the inhibitor tetramethylammonium chloride, and with dithionite-reduced enzyme at pH 10(6Steenkamp D.J.

In each case, interaction of the magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons of the flavin semiquinone and reduced iron-sulfur center gives rise to a spin-interacting state, which is distinguished by a complex EPR signal centered near g = 2 and an unusually intense half-field (g ∼ 4) signal(12Stevenson R.C. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. Singer T.P. Beinert H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It has been shown that this spin-interacting state forms in the absence of any substantive protein conformational changes(13Bellamy H.D. Lim L.W. Mathews F.S. Dunham W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11887-11892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). trimethylamine dehydrogenase trimethylamine dehydrogenase reduced to the level of 2 equivalents/subunit flavin mononucleotide four iron-four sulfur center oxidized iron-sulfur center reduced iron-sulfur center electron paramagnetic resonance FMN hydroquinone. Reductive optical/EPR titrations of trimethylamine dehydrogenase with sodium dithionite have shown that the equilibrium distribution of reducing equivalents between the FMN and 4Fe/4S center in partially reduced enzyme is dependent on pH(11Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of fully reduced flavin with oxidized iron-sulfur is favored at low pH, whereas formation of flavin semiquinone and reduced iron-sulfur is preferred at high pH. The absorption spectrum of partially reduced enzyme exhibits changes that reflect this pH dependence, making it possible to follow the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer with a stopped-flow rapid mixing apparatus by using a pH jump technique(11Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, partially reduced enzyme is prepared in a weakly buffered (e.g. 10 mM) solution at a known initial pH and then rapidly mixed with a strongly buffered (e.g. 100 mM) solution at a different final pH. The initial equilibrium distribution of reducing equivalents within the enzyme (determined by the initial pH) is thus rapidly perturbed, permitting the kinetics of the approach of the system to the new equilibrium position (determined by the final pH) to be followed spectrophotometrically(14Hille R. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1241-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both electron transfer (from the flavin hydroquinone to the oxidized iron-sulfur center) and formation of the spin-interacting state occur in the course of the catalytic cycle of trimethylamine dehydrogenase. The present studies have been undertaken to further examine the role of protonation/deprotonation events in each of these two processes. We find that the behavior of the enzyme is best described by a model in which electron transfer and protonation/deprotonation events are treated as independent equilibria. In addition, evidence is presented that formation of the spin-interacting state of trimethylamine dehydrogenase is governed by an ionization having a pKa of ∼9.5. Bacterium W3A1 was grown, and trimethylamine dehydrogenase was purified as described by Steenkamp and Mallinson (15Steenkamp D.J. Mallinson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), with the exception that the gel filtration step was performed using Sephacryl S-200 instead of Sephadex G-200. Phosphate and pyrophosphate buffers were obtained from Sigma, and boric acid was from Jennielle Chemical Co. Use of inorganic buffers (i.e. phosphate, pyrophosphate, borate) is preferred over organic buffers in studies of trimethylamine dehydrogenase since most organic buffers contain substituted amines, which either inhibit the enzyme or serve as substrates. Benzyl viologen and phenazine ethosulfate were also obtained from Sigma. Sodium dithionite was obtained from Virginia Chemicals. Concentrated sodium dithionite stock solutions were prepared by the addition of the solid to an anaerobic buffer solution, which was transferred to an anaerobic syringe equipped with a ground glass joint. D2O (99.9% enriched) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Isotopic mixtures of enzyme and buffer solutions were prepared by mixing appropriate volumes of separately buffered solutions of H2O and D2O, with the D2O solutions prepared taking into account the necessary correction of the pH meter reading to obtain the pD (pD = meter reading + 0.4; (16Gutfreund Enzymes: Physical Principals. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1977: 173Google Scholar)). pD for D2O buffers was adjusted using either NaOD (40% (w/w) in 99.9% D2O) or DCl (20% (w/w) in 99.9% D2O), both obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. D2O solutions were prepared immediately before use and kept in capped bottles sealed with Parafilm® to prevent contamination with atmospheric moisture. In order to prepare two-electron reduced trimethylamine dehydrogenase for pH(D) jump measurements, concentrated samples of oxidized enzyme were passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (1.5 × 25 cm) equilibrated with a 10 mM solution of an appropriate buffer and adjusted to the desired initial pH. Enzyme in D2O was obtained by passage through a separate Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with D2O buffer (initial swelling of the dried gel material having also been performed with D2O). 10 mM buffers adjusted to the initial pH(D) also contained 0.1 M potassium chloride, 0.5 μM phenazine ethosulfate, and 0.5 μM benzyl viologen. Potassium chloride was included to maintain solvent ionic strength throughout the experiment. The dyes were included to facilitate initial enzyme reduction and, at the low concentrations used, have been shown to have no effect on the observed kinetics(11Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solutions of 0.1 M buffer at the desired mol fraction of D2O and desired final pH(D) were added to 20-ml glass syringes, bubbled for 30 min with anhydrous, O2-free argon, and sealed with rubber septa. For experiments in mixed solvent, enzyme was diluted with the appropriate buffer to give the desired mol fraction D2O and a final enzyme concentration of 50-100 μM (25-50 μM dimers) and placed with a tonometer equipped with a ground glass joint for the dithionite titration syringe, a side arm cuvette, and a three-way stopcock valve with a male Luer connector. The sample was made anaerobic by repeated evacuation and flushing with anhydrous, O2-free argon, after which the tonometer was fitted with an anaerobic syringe containing a dithionite solution, and the enzyme was titrated to the level of two equivalents/subunit with sodium dithionite. No differences were observed between enzyme solutions prepared in D2O and used immediately and enzyme solutions prepared in D2O and allowed to stand overnight before use. Earlier studies have shown that the bisulfite product of dithionite oxidation reacts with oxidized trimethylamine dehydrogenase at pH ≤ 7 (11Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As an alternative to dithionite, low pH enzyme samples used in optical/EPR measurements were reduced with titanium citrate solutions (see below). This method of reduction is inappropriate for the preparation of pH jump samples; however, since titanium citrate requires strongly buffered (0.1-0.2 M) citrate solutions to remain in solution. The bisulfite adduct problem was avoided in the earlier pH jump study by first reducing the enzyme in 1 mM borate buffer, pH 10, and then bringing the solution to 10 mM phosphate at the desired initial pH by the addition of concentrated phosphate buffer(11Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, for the purposes of this study, the complexity of this procedure would likely lead to H2O contamination of D2O solutions and was not used. Since formation of the bisulfite adduct renders the FMN redox-inert, any enzyme molecules that have reacted with bisulfite (estimated to be no greater than 10-20% in any case) are assumed not to contribute to the absorbance change on the timescale of the pH(D) jump experiment and merely add to the total background absorbance. Any substantial breakdown of a sulfite adduct under the present experimental conditions would be expected to give rise to extremely slow spectral changes. The absence of such slow spectral changes in the transients observed in the course of the work presented here indicates that sulfite adduct formation presents a negligible problem in the present studies. Rapid reaction studies were carried out as described previously, using a stopped-flow apparatus whose calibrated dead time was determined to be 600 μs(11Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Time courses were fitted to either single or double exponential expressions (ΔA(t) = ΣΔAnexp(-knt)) using an iterative nonlinear least squares Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (17Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1969: 235-236Google Scholar) for the parameters ΔAn and kn representing the total absorbance change and observed rate constant, respectively, exhibited by the nth kinetic phase. Optical/EPR titrations were performed using an anaerobic cuvette equipped with a quartz observation cell and a port sealed with a rubber septum. Anaerobic samples of oxidized enzyme were prepared at the desired pH through the use of a Sephadex G-25 column and titrated with reductant as described above. For samples at pH ≥ 8, sodium dithionite was used as the reductant; enzyme samples at pH < 8 were reduced with titanium citrate, prepared according to Zehnder et al.(18Zehnder A.J.B. Wuhrmann K. Science. 1976; 194: 1165-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) by anaerobic addition of a 1.9 M solution of TiCl3 in 2.0 M hydrochloric acid (from Aldrich) to an appropriate volume of 0.1 M sodium citrate (from Pierce), followed by adjustment of the pH to 7.0. After reduction to an appropriate level, 400-μl enzyme samples were removed using a long needle Hamilton syringe and placed in quartz EPR tubes which had been previously flushed with O2-free argon and finally frozen on liquid nitrogen. X band EPR spectra were recorded at 15 K using a Brüker ER 300 EPR spectrometer equipped with a ER035M gaussmeter and a Hewlett-Packard 5352B microwave frequency counter. Instrument parameters are given in the appropriate figure legends. A total of 20-50 40-second scans were accumulated for each sample to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. EPR signal intensities due to flavin semiquinone and reduced iron-sulfur were determined by double integration of spectra using Brüker Instruments software. Intensities of the half-field signal indicative of the spin-interacting state were determined using the peak-to-trough amplitude of the signal at g ∼ 4. Optical/EPR reductive titrations of trimethylamine dehydrogenase at pH 6 and pH 10 have established the pH dependence of the intramolecular electron distribution between the FMN and 4Fe/4S centers in partially reduced enzyme(11Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the FMN semiquinone seen in partially reduced enzyme ionizes over this pH range; the neutral form is observed at pH 6, and the anionic form is observed at pH 10. The visible absorbance spectrum for TMADH2eq at pH 10 exhibits absorbance peaks at 365, 440, and 510 nm (Fig. 1 - - -), and is nearly identical to that seen at pH 8.0 with enzyme reduced by excess substrate or by dithionite in the presence of the inhibitor tetramethylammonium chloride(7Steenkamp D.J.

Previous work has shown that this three-banded spectrum arises from the form of the enzyme that exhibits the complex high field EPR spectrum and half-field (g ∼ 4) signal indicative of the spin-interacting state (Fig. 2 A and B; (5Steenkamp D.J.

Sands R.H. Singer T.P. Beinert H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). Since these EPR features reflect magnetic interaction of the unpaired electron spins on the two centers, TMADH2eq at pH 10 must possess (anionic) flavin semiquinone and a reduced iron-sulfur center. At pH 6, on the other hand, the reductive titration data (11Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that much of the flavin exists as the hydroquinone in TMADH2eq (Fig. 1••••). At no time during the pH 6 reductive titration are the EPR features characteristic of the spin-interacting state observed.Figure 2:EPR spectra of TMADH2eq at pH 10.0 and 8.0. Enzyme in 0.1 M potassium borate, pH 10.0, or 0.1 M sodium pyrophosphate, pH 8.0, buffer containing 0.5 μM benzyl viologen was reduced with dithionite to 2 equivalents/subunit.

Panel D is the half-field region of the spectrum of TMADH2eq at pH 8.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The visible absorbance spectrum of TMADH2eq at pH 8 is intermediate between that seen at pH 6 and 10, showing some of the features present in the pH 10 spectrum and suggesting that two-electron reduced enzyme contains mostly flavin semiquinone and reduced iron-sulfur center at pH 8 (Fig. 1 - - - -). However, the features at 365 and 440 nm are not as well defined at pH 8 as they are at pH 10, and the peak at 510 nm seen in the pH 10 spectrum is virtually absent in the spectrum at pH 8, indicating that a significant difference exists in TMADH2eq at these two pH values. These differences appear to reflect changes in ionization of the flavin semiquinone and, to a lesser degree, a shift in the electron distribution toward further iron-sulfur reduction at the higher pH. Differences between TMADH2eq at pH 8 and 10 is most pronounced when examined by EPR. At pH 10, the EPR spectrum of TMADH2eq reflects formation of the spin-interacting state (Fig. 2 A and B). At pH 8, however, the high-field region of the EPR spectrum reflects a simple combination of flavin semiquinone and reduced 4Fe/4S signals (Fig. 2C), and no half-field feature indicative of spin-interaction is observed (Fig. 2D). EPR spectra of samples at pH 8 were recorded at several microwave power levels in order to facilitate quantitation of these signals (the flavin semiquinone readily power saturates at the low temperatures required to observe the reduced 4Fe/4S center). Spin integration of the axial flavin semiquinone and rhombic 4Fe/4S EPR signals for TMADH2eq at pH 8 extrapolated to very low microwave power (<1 microwatts, so as not to saturate the flavin semiquinone signal) confirms a 1:1 stoichiometry, i.e., an electron distribution in which one reducing equivalent is on the FMN and one is on the iron-sulfur center. This important result indicates that an intramolecular electron distribution consisting of a flavin semiquinone and a reduced iron-sulfur center is necessary, but not sufficient, to produce the spin-interacting form of the enzyme. One or more ionizable groups with pKa values > 8 must be responsible for induction of the spin-interacting state in TMADH2eq on raising the pH from 8 to 10. The pH dependence of the g ∼ 4 signal intensity at 15 K is shown in Fig. 3A, and indicates that formation of the spin-interacting state of the enzyme is controlled by a single ionizable group exhibiting a pKa of 9.4. In an effort to correlate formation of the spin-interacting state with ionization of the neutral flavin semiquinone and to determine directly the pKa for ionization of the semiquinone, the pH dependence of the absorbance at 365 nm of TMADH2eq has been examined. 4It is often possible to distinguish between the two forms of semiquinone in flavoproteins by EPR since the neutral form exhibits EPR line widths of ∼19 gauss, whereas the anionic form exhibits line widths of ∼15 gauss(19Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2614-2620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar20Massey V. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3181-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar21Ehrenberg A. Müller F. Hemmerich P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 2: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The flavin semiquinone of trimethylamine dehydrogenase exhibits line widths of 18.8 and 15.6 gauss at pH 6 and 10, respectively, and a pK for the semiquinone of 8.0 has been estimated on the basis of the pH dependence of the line width(11Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the signal intensity of the EPR signal at 150 K decreases significantly above pH 9 as the spin-interacting state accumulates, suggesting that the magnetic interaction between the unpaired electron spins of the flavin semiquinone and reduced iron-sulfur cluster (manifested directly in the EPR signal at 15 K) modulates the signal intensity of the EPR signal of the flavin radical observed at 150 K. The upshot is that the pK of the flavin semiquinone cannot be sufficiently accurately determined from EPR line widths for the present purposes. The anionic form of flavin semiquinone displays an absorbance band at this wavelength(19Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2614-2620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the case of trimethylamine dehydrogenase is relatively uncomplicated by the spectral contribution of its iron-sulfur center. The pH dependence of the 365 nm absorbance in TMADH2eq is shown in Fig. 3B, where it is evident that the absorbance grows in over too great a pH range to be attributable to a single ionization. A fit of the data using a two-pKa equation suggests that full formation of the semiquinone anion requires the ionizations of two groups exhibiting pKa values of 8.0 and 9.7, the latter being within experimental error of that determined from the pH dependence of the g ∼ 4 signal. One of these ionizations must derive from the N-5 position of the flavin semiquinone, while the other presumably derives from another site in the protein, possibly hydrogen-bonded or otherwise associated with the iron-sulfur center. The data indicate that three conditions must be met for formation of the spin-interacting state in TMADH2eq: 1) the distribution of reducing equivalents within the active site must give flavin semiquinone and reduced iron-sulfur center; 2) the semiquinone must be ionized; and 3) a third group within the active site must also be deprotonated. All of these requirements are met at pH 10, but only the first (and possibly the second, to a greater or lesser extent) is met at pH 8. (High pH) minus (low pH) kinetic difference spectra for TMADH2eq show maxima at 365, 410, and 520 nm (11Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol.

This indicates that it should be possible to separately monitor intramolecular electron transfer and formation/decay of the spin-interacting state of TMADH2eq subsequent to a pH jump. Accordingly, pH(D) jump experiments between pH(D) 8 and 6 (following principally intramolecular electron transfer between the flavin and iron-sulfur center), between pH(D) 10 and 8 (principally following formation of the spin-interacting state), and between pH(D) 10 and 6 (which monitors both processes) have been undertaken. Time courses for the 10 → 6 and 10 → 8 pH jump reactions with TMADH2eq, as carried out by stopped-flow in H2O, exhibit monophasic behavior and are successfully fit using a single exponential expression (Fig. 4 A and B). The kinetic behavior and fitted rate constants obtained are consistent with the results of previous work(11Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol.

The equilibrium of the nonenzymatic reaction, which equilibrates slowly in the absence of enzyme, greatly favors 5-CHO-H4PteGlun. The enzyme couples the reaction to the hydrolysis of ATP shifting the equilibrium to favor 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlun. Substrate-dependent non-equilibrium isotope exchange of ADP into ATP was observed, suggesting the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate of 5-CHO-H4PteGlunduring the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The competitive inhibitor 5-formyltetrahydrohomofolate also supported the ADP to ATP exchange, suggesting that this molecule could also form a phosphorylated intermediate. The initial rates of the ADP-ATP exchange with saturating ADP were about 70 s− for both compounds, while the kcat values for product formation were 5 s− for 5-CHO-H4PteGlun and 0.005 s− for 5-formyltetrahydrohomofolate. Starting with 5-[18O]CHO-H4PteGlun, it was shown by 31P NMR that the formyl oxygen of the substrate was transferred to the product phosphate during the reaction. This further supports the existence of a phosphorylated intermediate. The formyl group of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is known to be an equilibrium mixture of two rotamers. Stopped-flow analysis of the enzymatic reaction showed that only one of the rotamers serves as a substrate for the enzyme. 5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase catalyzes the irreversible conversion of 5-formyl-tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates (5-CHO-H4PteGlun) to 5,10-methenyltetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates (5, 10-CH+-H4PteGlun).

The origin and function of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun has been a source of confusion and debate(8Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The acid-catalyzed interconversion of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun and 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlun occurs nonenzymatically with the equilibrium greatly favoring 5-CHO-H4PteGlun at pH 7(2Kay L.D. Osborn M.J. Hateri Y.

Soc. 1972; 94: 7542-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The rate of the nonenzymatic reaction occurs on the time scale of hours under physiological conditions and is complicated by 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlun also being hydrolyzed to 10-CHO-H4PteGlun. By coupling to ATP hydrolysis, the equilibrium is shifted to favor 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlun at pH 7. For many years, neither an enzymatic source nor function of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun was known. This suggested that the function of MS was to serve as a salvage pathway for the reincorporation of this nonenzymatically produced folate derivative into the one-carbon pool. 5-CHO-H4PteGlun has been found to occur in many cells at low concentrations(8Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, its presence in cells is suspect since the harsh procedures used to extract folates are known to convert 10-CHO-H4PteGlun to 5-CHO-H4PteGlun. Recently, it was shown that in Neurospora crassa conidiospores at least 85% of the folate pool is 5-CHO-H4PteGlun(10Kruschwitz H.L. McDonald D. Cossins E.A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mild extraction procedure was shown not to account for the presence of the 5-CHO-H4PteGlun. Because 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is the only tetrahydrofolate derivative that is stable to oxidative degradation, these studies suggested that a physiological role is to serve as a storage form of this coenzyme in dormant stages of cellular life cycles. It has also been noted that 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is an inhibitor of many enzymes in one-carbon metabolism, suggesting it may also serve a regulation role(8Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Making irreversible would be beneficial to a cell whether 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is formed nonenzymatically, is used as a storage form for folates, or functions in regulation by inhibiting enzymes in one-carbon metabolism. 5-CHOH4PteGlu, clinically known as leucovorin, has been administered to cancer patients to rescue them from toxicity during high dose methotrexate chemotherapy, or more recently to enhance the cytotoxic activity of 5-fluorouracil(11Machover D. Schwarzenberg L. Goldschmidt E. Tourani J.M. Michalski B. Hayat M. Dorval T. Misset J.-L. Jasmin C. Maral R. Mathe G. Cancer Treat. Rep. 1982; 66: 1803-1907PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schweitzer B.I. Dicker A.P. Bertino J.R. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2441-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). MS is the only known enzyme that utilizes 5-CHO-H4PteGlun as a substrate. For 5-CHO-H4PteGlu to be effective as a rescue agent and an enhancer of 5-fluorouracil toxicity, it must first be converted to 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu through MS activity. The effectiveness of leucovorin in chemotherapy is at least partially dependent on the irreversibility of. It has been shown that doubling intracellular concentrations of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun, by inhibiting MS activity, suppressed growth of MCF-7 human breast cells by 80%(13Bertrand R. Jolivet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8843-8846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that MS could be a potentially important enzyme as a target in chemotherapy. In this paper, we report the mechanism of the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to the conversion of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun to 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlun by MS. By using NMR spectroscopy and isotope exchange techniques, a 5-CHO-H4PteGlun phosphorylated intermediate was demonstrated. The role of this intermediate in making irreversible is discussed. (6R,6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu (folinic acid, calcium salt), MgATP, ADP (sodium salt), 1 M MgCl2 standard solution, and other buffer reagents were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. [2,8-3H]ADP (15 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals Inc. H2[18O] (95% enriched) was purchased from ICON Services, Inc. (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu, (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu4, and (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu5 were generous gifts of Dr. Anthony L. Fitzhugh (NCI-FCRDC). 5-Formyltetrahydrohomofolate was kindly provided by Dr. Barry Shane (University of California at Berkeley) and further purified by HPLC on a Spherisorb C18 column. The compound was eluted with a gradient from 50 mM KMES, pH 6.0, to 10% acetonitrile in H2O, and the concentration was determined by using the molar extinction coefficient of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate at 287 nm (ε = 31,500 M− cm−) (14Temple C. Montgomery J.A. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.J. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Folates. Vol. I. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 80Google Scholar). Rabbit livers were from Pel-Freeze Biologicals (Rogers, AK). Livers were quick-frozen and shipped within 24 h on dry ice after removal from the rabbits and stored at −70°C. MS was purified from the rabbit livers as previously described(15Stover P. Huang T. Schirch V. Maras B. Valiante S. Barra D. Ayling J.E. Nair M.G. Baugh C.M. Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines and Folates. Plenum Press, NY1993: 723-726Google Scholar), and the concentration was determined by using the A278 extinction coefficient of 15 mM− cm−. Either 15 mg of (6R,6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu or 5 mg of (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu4 were dissolved in 1 ml of H2O, and the pH was adjusted to 2 by addition of 6 N HCl. The conversion to 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlun was allowed to proceed for 15 h at 4°C. The molar absorption coefficients (ε360 = 25, 100 M− cm− and ε278 = 31,500 M− cm−) were used to determine the concentration of 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlun and 5-CHO-H4PteGlun, respectively(14Temple C. Montgomery J.A. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.J. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Folates. Vol. I. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 80Google Scholar). The yellow crystals of 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 10 mM HCl, and the crystals were lyophilized and stored at −20°C. 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu4 did not crystallize at pH 2 and was stored at −20°C without further purification in the 10 mM HCl solution. Activity assays during MS purification were performed at 30°C in 1 ml of 50 mM KMES, pH 6.0, containing 1 mM MgATP and 300 μM (6R,6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.5 μg of pure MS or appropriate aliquots of impure enzyme. The initial rate was determined by measuring the linear increase in absorbance at 360 nm in the first minute of the reaction. Studies of competitive inhibition by 5-formyltetrahydrohomofolate were conducted in the presence of 1 mM MgATP. The value of Ki for 5-formyltetrahydrohomofolate was determined by varying the concentration of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu from 0.5 to 4 times its Km value (8 μM) in the presence of 0.14-0.56 μM 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate. Ki values were calculated from double reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus substrate concentration (16Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-663Crossref Scopus (7880) Google Scholar). Reaction solutions (0.5 ml) containing 1 mM MgATP, 0.5 mM [3H]MgADP (5 μCi), and either 2 mM (6R,6S) 5-CHO-H4PteGlu or 28 μM 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate were incubated at 30°C with 2 μg of MS in 50 mM KMES, pH 6.0. 100-μl aliquots were removed at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. The protein was removed by centrifugation after heating at 100°C for 1 min. A 40-μl aliquot of the supernatant was injected into a Hewlett Packard 1090 HPLC equipped with a Vydac nucleotide separation column. ADP and ATP were separated to base line resolution by isocratic elution with 0.15 M NaH2PO4, adjusted to pH 3.0 by glacial acetic acid. The fractions of ATP and ADP were collected and counted on a Packard Tri-Carb 1500. In each set of experiments, the control was always performed without the presence of the enzyme. In the study of the effect of ADP concentration on the rate of ADP conversion to ATP, 0.5 ml of the KMES buffer at pH 6.0 containing 1 mM MgATP, 2 mM (6R,6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu, and 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mM [3H]MgADP (0.25-2 μCi) were incubated with 2 μg of MS. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30°C, and 100-μl aliquots were removed and treated as described above. To determine reversibility of, a 1-ml reaction solution containing 0.5 mM [3H]MgADP (2 μCi) and either 200 μM 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu or 100 μM 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu4 was incubated with 7.2 μg of MS in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 100-μl aliquots were removed at 30, 60, and 90 min, which were treated the same as described above except that 20 μl of a 2.5 mM MgATP solution was added to the extract as an ATP carrier before injection into the HPLC. The labeled 5-CHO-H4PteGlu5 was synthesized by first converting the 16O-labeled 5-CHO-H4PteGlu5 to 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu5 in acid and then hydrolyzing back to 5-CHO-H4PteGlu5 in H2[18O]. (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu5 (1.9 μmol) was dissolved in 0.4 ml of H2[18O] in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, and the pH was adjusted to 1 by adding 10 μl of 6 N HCl. The solution was kept at 4°C, and the conversion to 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu5 was monitored at 360 nm. After 48 h, 64% of the (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu5 had been converted to 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu5. The solution was then made 150 mM in potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, with the addition of solid K2HPO4. The solution was also made 100 mM in 2-mercaptoethanol. The sealed Eppendorf tube was then heated at 90°C for 5 h to convert the 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu5 to (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu5(17Stover P. Schirch V. Anal Biochem. 1992; 202: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The yield of (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu5, calculated from the absorbance at 288 nm, was greater than 95%. This concentration was confirmed by the ability of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu5 to form a quinonoid complex absorbing at 502 nm with serine hydroxymethyltransferase and glycine(17Stover P. Schirch V. Anal Biochem. 1992; 202: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The large amount of phosphate in the product solution was then removed by chromatography on a 0.5 × 20-cm BioGel P2 column equilibrated with 5 mM NH4HCO3. The fractions with maximum absorbance at 288 nm were pooled and lyophilized to dryness. Based on the amount of 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu5 formed in acid from the initial (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu5, the product contained 36%16O- and 64%18O-labeled 5-CHO-H4PteGlu5. A reaction solution of 0.5 ml was placed in a 5 × 168-mm NMR tube and contained the following reagents: 50 mM KMES, pH 6.0, 5 mM MgATP, 2.0 mM (6S)-5-CH[18O]-H4PteGlu5, and 90% D2O as an internal frequency lock. A 31P spectrum was obtained as background before the addition of MS at 202.36 MHz on a Varian Gemini-500 spectrometer at 30°C with 384 transients, a 1.94-s acquisition time, and 30-μs pulse width. To the reaction solution, 2.4 μg of MS was added, and the solution was incubated for 1 h at 30°C. Then, another 31P spectrum was acquired using the same parameters as described above. The rate of formation of 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlun from either 5-CHO-H4PteGlu5 or 5-CHO-H4PteGlu in the presence of excess MS was determined by measuring the increase in A360 in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer from Kinetic Instruments Inc. A solution of 11.6 μM MS in 20 mM KMES, pH 6.0, was flowed against 24 μM (6R,6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu or 11 μM (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu5 in the same KMES buffer. The biphasic time course reaction profile was fitted by the Marquardt-Levenberg double exponential model, which gave the first-order rate constants and amplitudes of each phase. The experiments were performed at 21°C. 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate differs from 5-CHO-H4PteGlu by one additional methylene group between the pteridine and aminobenzoyl rings. To form the product 5,11-CH+-tetrahydrohomofolate would involve the formation of a 6-membered ring rather than the 5-membered ring of 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu. However, 5,11-CH+-tetrahydrohomofolate has been previously synthesized and shown to be an inhibitor of the enzyme 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, which converts 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu to 10-CHO-H4PteGlu(18Domanico P. Benkovic S.J. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 1086-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We determined that 5,11-CH+-tetrahydrohomofolate could be formed by MS catalysis from 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate by observing spectral changes at 316 nm, which characterizes the presence of 5,11-CH+-tetrahydrohomofolate(14Temple C. Montgomery J.A. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.J. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Folates. Vol. I. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 80Google Scholar). Less than 10% of 5 μM 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate was converted to 5,11-CH+-tetrahydrohomofolate after incubation with 0.6 μg of MS in 20 mM KMES buffer at 30°C for 1 h. Because of the low turnover rate, it was not possible to determine an accurate Km value for this compound. However, the rate did not change with increasing substrate concentration, suggesting that the Km value was much less than 5 μM. Assuming the enzyme was saturated with 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate in these assays, an apparent kcat value of 0.005 s− was determined from the initial velocity, which is 0.1% of the kcat value of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu. The affinity of 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate for MS was determined by observing it as a competitive inhibitor of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu. Using only the monoglutamate form of the substrate and 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate, a competitive inhibition pattern was observed in a double reciprocal plot of ΔA360versus 5-CHO-H4PteGlu concentration. A Ki of 0.1 μM was determined. This shows that 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate has a high affinity for the active site of MS but exhibits a low kcat value. Reversibility of the MS-catalyzed reaction had previously been examined by observing the formation of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu from 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu. No 5-CHO-H4PteGlu could be detected, suggesting that the reaction was not reversible(6Hopkins S. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5618-5622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu hydrolyzes to 10-CHO-H4PteGlu at the neutral pH conditions used in this experiment(19May M. Bardase T.J. Barger F.L. Lanford M. Ravel J.M. Sutherland G.L. Shive W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1951; 73: 3067-3095Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This decreases the sensitivity of the assay procedure and does not totally rule out that the reaction is reversible. To circumvent this problem, we examined the reversibility of by using the more sensitive incorporation of [3H]ADP into ATP. The reaction solution contained 2 μCi of 0.5 mM [3H]ADP, 7.2 μg/ml MS, and either 200 μM 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu or 100 μM 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu4. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 30°C, and 100-μl aliquots were removed after 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. The reaction was stopped by denaturing the enzyme at 100°C for 1 min, and the protein was removed by centrifugation. MgATP (50 nmol) was added as a carrier, and 40-μl aliquots were analyzed by HPLC. The results showed no detectable amounts of [3H]ATP. Existence of a phosphorylated intermediate was suggested using nonequilibrium isotope exchange. A Km of 8 μM and a kcat of 5 s− for (6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu were previously reported(7Maras B. Stover P. Valiante S. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18429-18433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When 2 mM (6R,6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu, 1 mM MgATP, and 2 μg of enzyme were used, the forward reaction proceeded at a rate which consumed about 80% of the substrate in a 2-h period. To this reaction mixture, 0.5 mM [3H]MgADP (5 μCi) was included, and 100-μl aliquots were removed at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. After removing the protein by heating and centrifugation, 40 μl of the supernatant from each time point were injected into a Vydac nucleotide column. This column not only separated ATP from ADP but also separated 5-CHO-H4PteGlu from 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu. This permitted the extent of the reaction to also be monitored. Fig. 1 shows the amount of [3H]ATP formed in the presence of (6R,6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu. The incorporation of 3H from ADP into ATP shows a decreasing rate with time of incubation when 5-CHO-H4PteGlu was used as the substrate. However, when 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate was used a linear incorporation of [3H]ADP into ATP was observed with a kex of 66 s− (Fig. 1). About 12.5% ADP was converted into ATP in 120 min in the presence of 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate compared to 1% for (6R,6S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu. The exchange experiments were also performed with increasing concentrations of MgADP at saturating levels of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu. The first 30 min of radiolabel incorporation into ATP were measured. The results show that the conversion of ADP to ATP depends on the initial concentration of ADP (Fig. 2). A double reciprocal plot of initial rate of [3H]ATP formation versus the concentration of ADP is linear, giving an apparent Km of 1.4 mM for ADP and a kex for the formation of ATP of 70 s−. A product inhibition constant of 0.3 mM for ADP has been previously determined(7Maras B. Stover P. Valiante S. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18429-18433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic mechanism of coupling ATP to the conversion of substrates to products can often be determined by following the path of oxygen atoms present in the substrate(20Cohn M. Hu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 21Seddon A.P. Meister A. J. Biol.

To follow these previously used methods, 5-CH[18O]-H4PteGlu5 was synthesized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using [16O]ATP, was performed in an NMR tube. The product phosphate was then analyzed by 31P NMR spectroscopy. The presence of one [18O]phosphate results in a 0.02-ppm up-field shift in the 31P signal(20Cohn M. Hu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that both [16O]phosphate (34%) and singly labeled [18O]phosphate (66%) were formed. The substrate was known to contain about 36% 5-CH[16O]-H4PteGlu5 and 64% 5-CH[18O]-H4PteGlu5. These results suggest that the oxygen atom on the formyl group of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu5 was transferred quantitatively to phosphate. In solution, 5-CHO-H4PteGlu exists as two slowly interconverting rotamers arising from partial hindered rotation of the formyl-N5 formamide bond. These two rotamers are present at a ratio of 2.35:1 at 25°C(22Feeney J. Albrand J.P. Boicelli C.A. Charlton P.A. Yourg D.W. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1980; 2: 176-180Crossref Google Scholar, 23Poe M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4576-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The structures of both rotamers have previously been determined by 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The more abundant rotamer has the formyl carbonyl oriented toward H6 and the formyl proton oriented in the same plane as the keto group of C4 of the pteridine ring. If only one rotamer of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu serves as a substrate for MS, the presence of excess enzyme should rapidly convert this rotamer to 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu with conversion of the second rotamer being controlled by the much slower nonenzymatic interconversion of the two rotamers. Using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, the rate of product formation can be followed with the use of excess enzyme. Fig. 4 shows the rate of 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu5 formation at 360 nm when 11.6 μM MS was flowed against 11.7 μM 5-CHO-H4PteGlu5 and 1.9 mM MgATP at 21°C. The data were fitted to a double exponential equation as represented by the solid line. The slower rate was 0.03 s− and was the same when either 5-CHO-H4PteGlu or 5-CHO-H4PteGlu5 was used as substrate. This rate is, within experimental error, the same rate of rotamer interconversion previously determined on our instrument(25Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of the amplitudes for the rapid and slow phases was 2.5. This result is also very close to the equilibrium ratio (2.35:1 at 25°C) determined by NMR spectroscopy(23Poe M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4576-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results suggest that MS uses as the substrate only the more abundant rotamer of both 5-CHO-H4PteGlu and 5-CHO-H4PteGlu5. This is the same rotamer bound by dihydrofolate reductase (24Feeney J. Birdsall B. Albrand J.P. Roberts G.C.K. Burgen A.S.V. Charlton P.A. Young D.W.

Chem. 1991; 266: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The metabolite 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlun can be hydrolyzed to both 10-CHO-H4PteGlun and 5-CHO-H4PteGlun at neutral pH. Its Keq for formation of 10-CHO-H4PteGlun can be readily determined experimentally, but the Keq for formation of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun can only be determined under acidic conditions and is less accurate. Using the Keq experimentally determined by Kay et al.(2Kay L.D. Osborn M.J. Hateri Y. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 195-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for, we calculate that the equilibrium ratio of product to reactant at pH 7.0 is 1:6.5 × 10−5. 5-CHO-H4PteGlun+H3O+→5,10-CH+-H4PteGlunReaction 2 Coupling ATP hydrolysis to results in 2Keq‘ is the value of the equilibrium constant with the H3O+ concentration adjusted to pH 7.0. with a predicted Keq‘ of 66 M. A similar calculation, based on the tetrahydroquinoxaline analog of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun, indicates that the Keq‘ for would approach 500 M(2Kay L.D. Osborn M.J. Hateri Y. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 195-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Benkovic S.J. Bullard W.P. Bendovic P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 7542-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our failure to find any incorporation of labeled ADP into ATP puts an upper limit on the rate of the reverse of of 0.08 min−. This is nearly 4000-fold slower than the enzyme-catalyzed rate of the forward reaction. This suggests that at pH 7.0 the equilibrium of does not favor 5-CHO-H4PteGlun to the extent predicted by the studies of Kay et al., since the predicted Keq‘ of 66 M for would show some isotope exchange of ADP into ATP. The studies of non-equilibrium isotope exchange of ADP and ATP with both 5-CHO-H4PteGlu and 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate suggest that although the overall reaction is irreversible, there is a reversible step involved on the pathway to the formation of 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlun. Fig. S1 proposes a mechanism to explain the observed results. The major rotamer of the enolate form of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu (structure I) makes a nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to form a phosphorylated 5-CHO-H4PteGlu (structure II, Fig. S1). At this intermediate, enzyme-bound ADP can freely equilibrate with solvent ADP. Reversal of this reaction (II to I) would account for the incorporation of [3H]ADP into ATP (Fig. 1). Intermediate II would be formed with both 5-CHO-H4PteGlu and 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate. The studies with varied amounts of ADP show saturation kinetics (Fig. 2). The linear double reciprocal plot suggests a Michaelis-Menten mechanism in which the Km for ADP is 1.4 mM and the rate from ADP to ATP is about 70 s−. This rate is essentially the same rate determined from the study of ADP and ATP isotope exchange in the presence of 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate (66 s−). The rate of conversion of intermediate II to I is 10 times the kcat of 5 s− determined previously for (6Hopkins S. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5618-5622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intermediate II can proceed further in the reaction by attack of N10 of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu to form a putative tetrahedral intermediate (structure III, Fig. S1). This would collapse to eliminate phosphate and form the product 5,10-CH+-H4PteGlu (structure IV). It would be this last step that may be essentially irreversible since phosphate would be a poor nucleophile in the back reaction. The value of kcat probably is determined by either the conversion of intermediate II to III or the elimination of phosphate to form product. The observation that kcat for 5-CHO-tetrahydrohomofolate is 1000-fold less than the kcat for 5-CHO-H4PteGlu suggests that it is the conversion of intermediate II to intermediate III. The N11 of the homofolate analog would probably be out of optimum position to make the nucleophilic attack on the phosphorylated intermediate II. The NMR study provides additional evidence for the formation of the phosphorylated intermediate II. The mechanism in Fig. S1 predicts that the formyl oxygen of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu would be quantitatively transferred to phosphate. Starting the reaction with 5-[18O]CHO-H4PteGlu, NMR analysis shows that the oxygen is transferred to phosphate. An alternative mechanism, which would be consistent with the NMR data, is that ATP forms a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate and that 5-CHO-H4PteGlu is phosphorylated by the phosphoenzyme. However, this mechanism suggests that the enzyme would catalyze the equilibration of [3H]ADP and ATP in the absence of the 5-CHO-H4PteGlu. We found no evidence for this substrate-independent ADP-ATP exchange, which argues against a phosphorylated enzyme being formed. Another folate-dependent enzyme that utilizes ATP is N10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase, which catalyzes the synthesis of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate from formate and tetrahydrofolate. ATP hydrolysis to ADP and phosphate is coupled to this reaction to shift the equilibrium to favor 10-CHO-H4PteGlu. In eukaryotic cells, this activity is part of a trifunctional enzyme, while in bacteria it is monofunctional(26Mejillano M.R. Jahansouz H. Matsunaga T.O. Kenyon G.L. Himes R.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5136-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mejillano et al.(26Mejillano M.R. Jahansouz H. Matsunaga T.O. Kenyon G.L. Himes R.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5136-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes form a formyl phosphate as an intermediate. However, ADP remains bound to the enzyme so the formate-dependent ADP-ATP exchange is very slow. Schrimsher et al.(27Schrimsher J.L. Schendel F.J. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4356-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have shown that aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of the imidazole ring in purine biosynthesis. Starting with [18O]formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide, these authors showed the existence of a phosphorylated intermediate of the substrate. However, ADP-ATP exchange was only 1/20th the rate of the reaction, again probably the result of a slow release of ADP from the enzyme.

Charge reversal at either of these two residues by site-directed mutagenesis generated mutant class II molecules that failed to appear at the cell surface. This defect in surface expression was partially reversed when the invariant chain was present or when the mutants were paired with the corresponding charge-reversed variant of the opposite chain. Surprisingly, surface expression was restored when cells expressing the single-site mutants were cultured at reduced temperature. In addition, the substitution of Asp-57β with residues found in alleles of class II molecules associated with diabetes resulted in heterodimers that were inefficiently expressed at the cell surface and presented foreign peptide poorly. Together, these results demonstrate that the formation of a salt-bridge between Arg-80α and Asp-57β is required for efficient surface expression of class II MHC molecules, therefore representing an important step in the assembly and transport of functional class II heterodimers to the cell surface.

The three-dimensional structures of both class I and II MHC molecules complexed with self- or foreign peptide antigens have recently been solved, revealing much about the molecular basis of peptide binding to MHC molecules(2Bjorkman P.J.

Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). Structurally, both classes of MHC molecules are similar, as predicted by sequence comparison(9Brown J.H. Jardetzky T. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bjorkman P.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1988; 332: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar); however, they differ in fine detail, especially in the peptide-binding site(7Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar, 8Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). These differences partly account for the distinct manner in which each class of molecule binds peptide. In class I molecules, residues forming the “ends” of the peptide-binding site bury the termini of bound peptides(3Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 4Fremont D.H. Matsumura M. Stura E.A. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A.

Nature. 1992; 360: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In contrast, in class II molecules, both ends of the peptide-binding site are “open,” allowing the termini of bound peptides to extend out of the site(7Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar, 8Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C.

In both classes of MHC molecules, the presence of bound peptides influences their tertiary structure and efficiency of appearance on the cell surface. The binding of self- and foreign peptides to the class I heavy chain promotes the folding, assembly, and surface expression of class I molecules by stabilizing the class I complex(18Townsend A.

Cell. 1990; 62: 285-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Similarly, peptide binding to class II molecules influences the conformation, stability, and surface appearance of class II molecules (20Sadegh-Nasseri S. Germain R.N. Nature. 1991; 353: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 21Germain R.N. Hendrix L.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 22Stern L.J. Wiley D.C.

Thus, detailed functional analysis of the peptide-binding sites of both classes of molecules will be necessary to understand the role of peptide binding in determining the tertiary structure, and hence, surface expression of MHC molecules and subsequent display of foreign antigens to the immune system. We have been interested in the biochemical basis of recognition of peptide antigens bound to MHC molecules by T cells. We have characterized the T cell receptor (TCR) expressed by the murine T cell clone D5(25Rao A. Faas S.J. Cantor H. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 479-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which recognizes arsonate (Ars)-conjugated peptides presented by the class II molecule I-Ad(26Nalefski E.A. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3806-3816PubMed Google Scholar). We have engineered single-site substitutions in the putative MHC/peptide antigen-binding site of the D5 TCR and have identified several residues that are important in recognition of the MHC•peptide complex(27Nalefski E.A. Kasibhatla S. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1553-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Kasibhatla S. Nalefski E.A. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3140-3151PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, we sought to compensate these single-site TCR mutations with complementary mutations in the I-Ad molecule. In the course of these studies, we identified an ion pair, Asp-57 of the β-chain and Arg-80 of the α-chain of I-Ad, that plays an essential role in surface expression of I-Ad as well as peptide presentation.

Nature. 1977; 268: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) used to assay IL-2 were maintained in complete medium supplemented with rat IL-2 (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA). RT2 cells were maintained in medium supplemented with HAT (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid constructions were carried out by standard techniques(35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids containing Aαd cDNA (Aαd-Sal-EXV, [36]), Aβd cDNA (Aβd-EXV(37Miller J. Germain R.N. J. Exp.

Control plasmid encoding chimeric molecule 2B4β-ζ, which consists of the extracellular domains of the 2B4 TCR β-chain fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the TCR ζ-chain (β-ζ in pCDL-SRα(38Engel I.

EcoRI fragments containing Aαd and Aβd cDNA were subcloned into the polylinker EcoRI site of the expression plasmid pLGP-3, kindly provided by Dr. P. Hogan (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), which is derived from the plasmid pCD and contains an SV40 promotor for transient expression of cDNA in COS cells and fd to generate single-stranded templates for mutagenesis(39Nardone J. Gerald C. Rimawi L. Song L. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4412-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on uracil-labeled, single-stranded templates, as described previously(27Nalefski E.A. Kasibhatla S. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1553-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), using oligonucleotides listed in Table 1 to generate variants. Variants were initially screened by analyzing restriction enzyme sites introduced or destroyed by the mutagenic oligonucleotides (Table 1). Sequences of variants were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing the entire α1- or β1-domain of each plasmid using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab COS cells were transfected essentially as described(40Layet C. Germain R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2346-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A total of 2 × 106 COS cells was plated in complete medium in 75-cm2 flasks 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10 mM HEPES and cultured with a total of 10 μg each of α- and β-chain plasmid DNA in 6 ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10 mM HEPES, 100 μM chloroquine (Sigma), 250 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia) for 4 h at 37°C. The DNA solution was removed, and cells were left in 6 ml of shock medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10 mM HEPES, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide for 3 min at room temperature. Shock medium was removed and replaced with 20 ml of complete medium. Cells were cultured for 2 days prior to analysis. As a control, in each experiment COS cells were mock-transfected with medium lacking I-Ad plasmids or were transfected with I-Adα-chain plasmid alone. When indicated, 20 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the invariant chain or the co-transfection control molecule 2B4β-ζ was co-transfected along with I-Ad plasmid DNA. Culture supernatants from B cell hybridomas used as control and I-Ad-reactive mAb for flow cytometry are listed in Table 2. All B cells hybridomas were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), except K24-199 cells, kindly provided by Dr. D. McKean (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Cell staining was carried out as described (27Nalefski E.A. Kasibhatla S. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1553-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using saturating concentrations of mAb supernatants determined by staining I-Ad on transfected RT2 L cells (data not shown). Cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using the FACScan software program. Dead cells were excluded from analysis by staining with propidium iodide. Results of flow cytometry of transfected COS cells are displayed as histograms of cell number versus fluorescence intensity or are expressed as “fluorescence units”(40Layet C. Germain R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2346-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A total of 5000 cells was analyzed for each sample. Fluorescence units were calculated as the product of the number of “positive” cells exhibiting fluorescence above a reference point and the mean fluorescence of those cells. The reference point was set such that mock-transfected COS cell populations contained fewer than 1% of total cells with fluorescence above this level when the I-Ad test mAb was used (see Fig. 1). In general, fewer than 1% of total COS cells transfected with I-Ad plasmids displayed fluorescence above this reference point when stained with control mAb. The mean fluorescence of the positive cells was calculated from mean channel fluorescence provided by the FACScan program using the formula: Mean fluorescence = 1010(mean channel fluorescence/256).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A total of 105 T cell hybridomas was cultured in triplicate with 2 × 104 transfected COS cells and serial 3-fold dilutions of peptide antigen in 200 μl in 96-well microtiter plates. After 20 h, supernatants were removed, frozen, and tested for the ability to promote the growth of the IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-20. Viability of the CTLL-20 cells was measured by their reduction of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]2,5-diphenyl tetrazolum bromide (Sigma) using a Vmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) by recording OD570 nm after subtracting OD650 nm. Arsonate-conjugated Ova peptides spanning residues 33-49 and 33-50, Ars-Ova(33-49) and Ars-Ova(33-50), were prepared as described previously(26Nalefski E.A. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3806-3816PubMed Google Scholar). The Ova(323-339) peptide was synthesized by M. Berne (Tufts University, Boston, MA) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC-purified peptide λ cI(12-26) was kindly provided by Dr. T. Briner. Relative peptide presentation was defined as the ratio [peptide]WT/[peptide]variant, where [peptide]WT and [peptide]variant are the peptide concentrations in cultures of COS cells expressing wild-type and variant I-Ad molecules, respectively, that stimulated half-maximal IL-2 secretion by T hybridoma cells. We individually substituted Lys for several negatively charged residues in the α-helical regions of the α1- and β1-domains of the I-Ad heterodimer by site-directed mutagenesis (Table 1 and Fig. 9). These helices form the “walls” of the peptide-binding site of MHC molecules and, when bound with foreign peptide, are recognized by the TCR. We chose to express these variant I-Ad molecules in COS cells because COS cells can transiently express murine class II molecules even though they fail to express the invariant chain(37Miller J. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We analyzed expression of these variant I-Ad molecules by flow cytometry using a variety of mAb recognizing different epitopes on I-Ad (Table 2). We then tested the ability of the variant class II molecules expressed on COS cells to present foreign peptides to I-Ad-restricted, antigen-specific T cell hybridomas. Between 10 and 50% of COS cells transiently transfected with wild-type (WT) α- and β-chains of I-Ad displayed significant surface staining with I-Ad-reactive mAb MK-D6 above staining with control mAb (Fig. 1). In contrast, mock-transfected COS cells failed to stain specifically with mAb MK-D6 (Fig. 1). COS cells transfected with I-Adα- or β-chain DNA alone failed to stain with mAb recognizing either I-Adα- or β-chains (see below and data not shown), demonstrating the strict requirement for both α- and β-chains of I-Ad for surface expression of I-Ad heterodimers as previously reported(37Miller J. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). COS cells expressing WT I-Ad and the 11 variant Lys-substituted heterodimers listed in Table 1 were analyzed by flow cytometry using several mAb reactive against either the α1- or β1-domains of I-Ad (Table 2). The relative efficiency of surface expression of WT and variant I-Ad molecules was estimated by calculating fluorescence units for each combination of α- and β-chains (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, of the 11 Lys substitutions, only one, D57Kβ, prevented surface expression of I-Ad, since neither the α-chain-reactive mAb K24-199 nor any of the β-chain-reactive mAb recognized COS cells transfected with this variant. The remaining 10 Lys substitutions did not affect surface expression of I-Ad since they all reacted with α-chain mAb K24-199 and at least one β-chain mAb. Of these, seven (E51Kα, E59Kα, E70Kα, E74Kβ, D76Kβ, E84Kβ, and E87Kβ) had no effect on mAb reactivity: COS cells expressing these variant heterodimers stained with all mAb tested at intensities within a factor of three compared to COS cells expressing WT I-Ad. In contrast, the remaining three substitutions (E59Kβ, E66Kβ, and E69Kβ) eliminated recognition by one or more of the β-chain mAb. The E59Kβ heterodimer failed to stain with mAb BP107 and N22, the E66Kβ heterodimer failed to stain with mAb 34-5-3S, and the E69Kβ heterodimer failed to stain with mAb MK-D6, 34-5-3S, BP107, 28-16-8S, and M5/114. Therefore, Glu-59β, Glu-66β, and Glu-69β are likely to be solvent accessible in I-Ad, in agreement with the orientation of the corresponding residues in the human class II molecule HLA-DR1(7Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar, 8Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). The loss of reactivity of mAb with these variant I-Ad molecules agrees with previous reports demonstrating that the N-terminal half of the α-helix of the β1-domain of I-A molecules contributes to the epitopes of several mAb (for example, see Refs. 36, 52). In addition, our results agree with previous epitope mapping and provide new or more detailed information regarding the reactivity of several mAb (see Table 2). We determined whether any of the 10 substitutions that were tolerated with respect to surface expression of I-Ad affected the presentation of foreign peptides to an I-Ad-restricted T cell hybridoma. Fig. 3A shows representative experiments indicating that COS cells expressing each of these variant heterodimers were able to present Ars-Ova(33-50) to D5h cells. Fig. 3B summarizes the results of several such experiments. When the slight differences in surface expression between the variant and WT I-Ad heterodimers are taken into account (see Fig. 2), each of these 10 variant heterodimers were within 10-fold as efficient at peptide presentation as WT I-Ad (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that although three of the 10 substitutions, including E59Kβ, E66Kβ, and E69Kβ, completely eliminated recognition by at least one mAb, none profoundly affected peptide presentation. As shown above (Fig. 2), the D57Kβ substitution impaired surface expression of I-Ad heterodimers. We further investigated the role of Asp-57β in surface expression of I-Ad by substituting Ser, Ala, or Arg at this position (Table 1). Ser and Ala were chosen because these residues are found at position β-57 in several natural variants of murine and human class II molecules(9Brown J.H. Jardetzky T. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bjorkman P.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1988; 332: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that variant heterodimers D57Sβ and D57Aβ were expressed on the cell surface but at levels significantly reduced relative to WT I-Ad. Surface staining of COS cells expressing the variant heterodimer D57Sβ was 7% (± 4%, n = 4), 21% (± 11%, n = 4) and 23% (± 10%, n = 4) of wild-type levels using mAb K24-199, MK-D6, and M5/114, respectively; for the variant D57Aβ, these values were 12% (± 7%, n = 4), 18% (± 13%, n = 4) and 21% (± 8%, n = 4), respectively. In addition, the D57Rβ substitution prevented expression of I-Ad on the surface of COS cells, thus resembling the D57Kβ substitution. Only in experiments in which surface expression of WT I-Ad was very high, indicative of experiments in which the efficiency of COS cell transfection was high, were we able to detect surface expression of the variant D57Rβ (see below). These results indicate that the identity of the side chain at position 57 in the I-Adβ-chain influences surface expression of the I-Ad heterodimer. Since the invariant chain has been demonstrated to regulate expression of class II molecules in vivo(53Viville S. Neefjies J. Lotteau V. Dierich A. Lemeur M. Ploegh H. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1993; 72: 635-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and enhance surface expression of certain class II molecules containing haplotype-mismatched α- and β-chains(40Layet C. Germain R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2346-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we tested whether co-expression of the invariant chain could enhance expression of WT or variant I-Ad molecules on the surface of transfected COS cells. In agreement with previous reports(40Layet C. Germain R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2346-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 54Peterson M. Miller J. Nature. 1990; 345: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), co-transfection with the invariant chain had little effect on surface staining of WT I-Ad by mAb MK-D6 and M5/114 but reproducibly enhanced staining of WT I-Ad by mAb K24-199 by 2.8-fold (± 0.7-fold, n = 4) (Fig. 4B). Co-transfection of the invariant chain reproducibly enhanced surface staining of variant heterodimers D57Sβ and D57Aβ by mAb K24-199, MK-D6, and M5/114. Enhancement of staining by mAb K24-199 was 14-fold (± 7-fold, n = 4) for D57Sβ and 13-fold (± 5-fold, n = 4) for D57Aβ; by MK-D6 was 3.2-fold (± 0.7-fold, n = 4) for D57Sβ and 2.3-fold (± 0.5-fold, n = 3) for D57Aβ; and by M5/114 was 3.6-fold (± 1.0-fold, n = 4) for D57Sβ and 3.8-fold (± 1.1-fold, n = 4) for D57Aβ. In fact, when the invariant chain was co-transfected, surface staining of these variant heterodimers was nearly as intense as observed with WT I-Ad (Fig. 4B); for D57Sβ and D57Aβ staining was 89% (± 15%, n = 4) and 78% (± 26%, n = 4), respectively, of wild-type levels using mAb M5/114. Co-expression of the invariant chain reproducibly enhanced expression of variants D57Kβ and D57Rβ to levels slightly above background (Fig. 4B); however, this effect was not observed in experiments in which the efficiency of COS cell transfection was low. Co-transfection with plasmid DNA encoding the chimeric cell surface molecule 2B4β-ζ (38Engel I. Ottenhoff T.H.M. Klausner R.D.

The isoproterenol-mediated increase in mAChR number was time dependent and reached a maximum by 48 h. Chick heart cells treated with isoproterenol exhibited a greater than 6-fold increase in the sensitivity for carbachol-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity as compared to control. Stimulation of cultured heart cells for 24 h with isoproterenol resulted in a 25-35% increase in cm2 mRNA levels as compared to control cm2 mRNA levels. In contrast, the level of cm4 mRNA was not significantly affected by isoproterenol treatment. cm2 mRNA levels were maximally elevated by 15 h following isoproterenol stimulation and remained elevated for up to 72 h. Incubation of cells with isoproterenol in the presence of Rp-cAMP, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, blocked the increase in the level of cm2 mRNA. Thus, prolonged activation of β-adrenergic receptors results in an increase in mAChR number and muscarinic responsiveness in chick heart cells due to a cAMP-dependent protein kinase mediated increase in cm2 mRNA levels.

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: mAChRmuscarinic acetylcholine receptorsQNBquinuclidinyl benzilateNMSN-methylscopolamineG-proteinGTP-binding proteinAngIIangiotensin IIAd1adenosine 1. are members of a large family of transmembrane spanning receptors that couple to guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) upon agonist activation. Five different genes encoding the mammalian mAChRs subtypes (m1-m5) have been identified (Kubo et al., 1986a, 1986b; Peralta et al., 1987a, 1987b; Bonner et al., 1987, 1988; Braun et al., 1987; Shapiro et al., 1988). The chick heart expresses at least three mAChR subtypes (cm2, cm3, and cm4) that share a high degree of homology to the mammalian m2, m3, and m4 mAChR (Tietje et al., 1990; Tietje and Nathanson, 1991; Gadbut and Galper, 1994). Agonist activation of mAChRs have been shown to result in a variety of physiological and biochemical events that include inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Nathanson et al., 1978), stimulation of guanylyl cyclase (Renaud et al., 1980), stimulation of phospholipase C (Brown and Masters, 1984), and alteration of ion channel conductances (Galper et al., 1982; Hunter and Nathanson, 1986). Activation of phospholipase C results in the generation of the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate (Orellana and Brown, 1985) and subsequent activation of protein kinase C and increase in intracellular calcium levels (Hirasawa and Nishisuka, 1985). In the continued presence of acetylcholine or other agonists, mAChR in the heart and other tissues undergo sequestration and a subsequent decrease in receptor number (Nathanson, 1987). Long term treatment of embryonic chick heart cells with muscarinic agonists results not only in a down-regulation of muscarinic receptor number, but also in a significant reduction in the levels of mRNA encoding the cm2 and cm4 mAChRs (Habecker and Nathanson, 1992; Habecker et al., 1993). In addition to the agonist-induced down-regulation of mAChRs in the chick heart, activation of adenosine (Ad1) and angiotensin II (AngII) receptors has also been shown to affect chick heart mAChR number and mRNA levels (Habecker and Nathanson, 1992). Chick cardiac cells also express β-adrenergic receptors which mediate stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Stimulation of mAChRs results in inhibition of β-adrenergic stimulation of cardiac contractility due at least in part through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Hartzell, 1988). muscarinic acetylcholine receptors quinuclidinyl benzilate N-methylscopolamine GTP-binding protein angiotensin II adenosine 1. We report here that persistent stimulation with the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol increases mAChR number and muscarinic responsiveness in chick heart cells due to a selective increase in cm2 mRNA levels with no effect on cm4 mRNA levels. White leghorn chicken eggs were obtained from H & N International (Redmond, WA) and maintained in a humidified 38°C incubator until the ninth day of incubation. Quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB, 35-44 Ci/mmol) and [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS, 85 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Corp. [3H]cAMP (36 Ci/mmol) was from ICN, and [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) was obtained from DuPont NEN and [α-3H]UTP (41 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham. The ion-exchange resin AG50W-X4 (200-400 mesh, hydrogen form) used in the cAMP accumulation assay was from Bio-Rad. Cell culture media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and Sigma. All other materials were purchased as described previously (Halvorsen and Nathanson, 1981). Heart cells from 9-day embryonic chicken were prepared as described by Subers and Nathanson(1988) in serum-free defined medium containing 98% M-199, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml final concentrations, respectively), insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), sodium selenite (5 ng/ml), testosterone (10 nM final concentration), and triiodothyronine (3 nM final concentration). Cardiac cells were plated at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/cm2 on 100-mm plastic tissue culture dishes and maintained in a 5% CO2 environment at 37°C. Isoproterenol, dissolved in 10 μM ascorbic acid, was added once daily, beginning 24 h after culture preparation and until 72 h or otherwise noted. The media was changed on the third day, and assays were performed on the fourth day of culture. The binding of [3H]QNB to mAChR in crude membrane homogenates was performed according to the method of Halvorsen and Nathanson(1981). Binding of [3H]NMS to cell surface mAChR on intact chick heart cells in culture was performed as described by Nathanson(1983). In all experiments, nonspecific binding was determined as amount of [3H]QNB binding remaining in the presence of 1 μM atropine. Chick heart cell in cultures were prepared as described above on 60-mm tissue culture plates. Carbachol-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was measured as described by Subers and Nathanson(1988). Antisense and sense RNA probes to a BamHI/XbaI fragment encoding the subtype-specific third cytoplasmic loop of the cm2 receptor (Tietje and Nathanson, 1991) and a BalI/SmaI fragment encoding the third cytoplasmic loop of the cm4 receptor (Tietje et al., 1990) were prepared as described by Habecker and Nathanson(1992). Antisense probes were synthesized with [α-32P]UTP and sense RNA for standards with [α-3H]UTP. Total cellular RNA was isolated as described by Peppel and Baglioni(1990) and stored in 2-propanol at −20°C until use. Samples were resuspended in 0.1% SDS, and the RNA concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometer. Quantitation of cm2 and cm4 mRNA was measured by hybridization of RNA samples with antisense probes as described by Habecker and Nathanson(1992). Chronic treatment of embryonic heart cells in culture with a high concentration of β-adrenergic agonist has been reported to result in an increase in mAChR number in membrane homogenates (Reithmann et al., 1992). However, because measurements of mAChRs were performed using the membrane-permeable muscarinic antagonist [3H]QNB, it was not demonstrated whether chronic β-adrenergic stimulation resulted in an increase in the number of mAChRs on the cell surface. To determine whether β-adrenergic stimulation resulted in an increase in mAChRs numbers on the surface of intact cells, we used the membrane-impermeable antagonist [3H]NMS. Treatment of cultured embryonic chick hearts in defined media with isoproterenol for 72 h resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the number of mAChR on the surface of intact cells as measured with the membrane-impermeable muscarinic antagonist [3H]NMS (Fig. 1). We also observed similar increases in the number of total cellular mAChR as measured by the binding of the lipophilic muscarinic antagonist [3H]QNB to membrane homogenates (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Inhibition of isoproterenol stimulation of increase in mAChR by the β-adrenergic antagonist nadolol and time course of isoproterenol- induced increase of mAChR number. A, antagonism of isoproterenol effect by pretreatment with nadolol. Primary heart cell cultures were pretreated with 2 μM nadolol (final concentration) 10 min prior to addition of isoproterenol. Cells were treated once daily for 3 days with either nadolol, 100 nM isoproterenol, vehicle (10 μM ascorbic acid), or nadolol with isoproterenol. Medium was changed on the third day of culture, and the binding of [3H]QNB to membrane homogenates was performed on the fourth day. Average [3H]QNB binding in membrane homogenates of control treated cells was 310 ± 20 fmol/mg protein. The isoproterenol values were significantly different from nadolol values, p < 0.01, and nadolol plus isoproterenol, p = 0.01. Data are presented as the means ± S.D. from three separate experiments which each had from six to eight independent determinations. There were no significant differences between nadolol alone and nadolol plus isoproterenol, p > 0.2. Statistical significance was calculated according to the Student's t test for unpaired observations, with p < 0.05 taken as significant. B, heart cells were treated for 24, 48, or 72 h with 100 nM isoproterenol prior to determination of [3H]QNB binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To ensure that the increase in mAChR numbers by isoproterenol stimulation was due to activation of β-adrenergic receptors, we pretreated the cells with the β-adrenergic antagonist nadolol. Pretreatment of embryonic chick cell cultures with nadolol prior to the addition of 100 nM isoproterenol significantly attenuated the increase in mAChR number (Fig. 2A). Treatment of cells with nadolol alone did not produce a significant effect on mAChR number as compared to control (Fig. 2A). In addition, we also observed a time-dependent increase in mAChR numbers in cells stimulated by isoproterenol. Muscarinic receptor number began to increase by 24 h and was maximally elevated by 48 h after isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 2B). In order to determine if the increase in mAChR number following β-adrenergic agonist stimulation resulted in an increased functional responsiveness to muscarinic agonists, we examined the ability of the mAChR to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity. The concentration-response curves for carbachol-mediated inhibition of forskolin stimulation of cyclic AMP formation demonstrated that chick heart cells treated with 10 μM isoproterenol exhibited an increased physiological sensitivity to muscarinic agonists (Fig. 3). Forskolin-mediated increase in cAMP formation was maximally inhibited 70% by carbachol in both isoproterenol-stimulated and vehicle-treated heart cells (Fig. 3). However, isoproterenol-treated cells exhibited greater than a 6-fold increase in the sensitivity for carbachol-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase as compared to control (EC50 values of 3.0 × 10-8 and 1.9 × 10-7M, for isoproterenol-treated and control cells, respectively). We examined if the increase in mAChR number was due to an increased level of mRNA encoding the mAChR. Cultured chick heart cells express two main mAChR subtypes, cm2 and cm4. The levels of cm2 and cm4 mRNA were quantitated by solution hybridization using subtype-specific riboprobes as described by Habecker and Nathanson(1992). Interestingly, isoproterenol stimulation of chick heart cell cultures resulted in a subtype-selective increase in the level of mAChR mRNA. Incubation with 100 nM isoproterenol for 24 h resulted in a 27% increase in cm2 mRNA levels as compared to control cm2 mRNA levels (1.1 ± 0.1 × 106 to 1.4 ± 0.1 × 106 molecules/μg RNA, p = 0.02). In contrast, the level of cm4 mRNA was not significantly affected by isoproterenol treatment (6.5 ± 0.1 × 105 and 6.8 ± 0.1 × 105 molecules/μg RNA, p > 0.1). cm2 mRNA levels were maximally elevated by 15 h following isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 4A) and remained elevated for up to 72 h. We used the competitive inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Rp-cAMP (Botelho et al., 1988), to test whether the increase in cm2 mRNA levels by isoproterenol was a result of activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Incubation of cells with isoproterenol in the presence of Rp-cAMP did not lead to an increase in the level of cm2 mRNA (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that the β-adrenergic receptor-mediated increase inmAChR expression is mediated through cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This work demonstrates that chronic stimulation of cultured chick heart cells β-adrenergic receptors results in an increased mAChR number and muscarinic responsiveness in chick heart cells due to a selective increase in cm2 mRNA levels with no effect on cm4 mRNA levels. Chick β-adrenergic receptors appear to be pharmacologically similar to the mammalian β-1 subtype (Port et al., 1992). Isoproterenol-mediated activation of these β-adrenergic receptors results in stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity and a subsequent increase in cAMP accumulation (Port et al., 1992). Pretreatment of cultured heart cells with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, Rp-cAMP, blocked the isoproterenol-mediated increase in cm2 mRNA levels. Thus, the isoproterenol-mediated increase in cm2 mRNA levels involves activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Interestingly, the isoproterenol-mediated increase in mAChRs numbers was due to a differential effect on cm2 and cm4 mRNA levels. Although cm2 mRNA levels were maximally increased by 25-35%, cm4 mRNA did not exhibit any changes following isoproterenol stimulation. Prolonged agonist activation of chick heart mAChRs results in a subsequent decrease in both mAChR number (Galper and Smith, 1980) in mRNA levels encoding both the cm2 and cm4 receptors (Habecker and Nathanson, 1992). Treatment of chick heart cells with muscarinic agonists causes both inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and stimulation of phospholipase C (Brown and Brown, 1984). Coupling of the mAChR to both second messenger pathways is required for agonist-mediated regulation of cm2 and cm4 mRNA. Simultaneous activation of the Ad1 receptor, which results in inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in the chick heart, and AngII receptors, which activates phospholipase C in the chick heart, also resulted in a reduction in mAChR numbers and cm2 and cm4 mRNA levels (Habecker and Nathanson, 1992). These results indicate that there is a complex role of second messenger pathways in the regulation of mAChR gene expression. While the mRNA encoding the cm2 and cm4 receptors are regulated in a similar fashion by activation of mAChR or Ad1 receptors and AngII receptors, the expression of cm2 and cm4 mRNAs are differentially regulated by β-adrenergic receptor activation. Reithmann et al.(1992) previously reported that chick cardiac cells which were treated with β-adrenergic agonists did not exhibit an increased magnitude of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in response to a single high concentration of carbachol. However, because of the presence of spare receptors, an increase in mAChR number should lead not to an increase in extent of inhibition but to a decrease in the concentration of carbachol required for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity (Halvorsen and Nathanson, 1981; Hunter and Nathanson, 1986). Indeed, we show here that the isoproterenol-mediated increase in mAChR numbers leads to a greater responsiveness to carbachol-mediated inhibition of forskolin stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3). We have shown here that chronic stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors by isoproterenol causes an increase in mAChR numbers in heart cells. In addition, these cells exhibit an increased sensitivity for mAChR-mediated inhibition of forskolin stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Furthermore, we have shown that β-adrenergic activation results in a selective increase in mRNA levels encoding the cm2 mAChR subtype. This increase in cm2 mRNA levels is dependent upon activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Long term treatment with β-adrenergic antagonists has been shown to induce an increase in β-adrenergic receptor number and a concomitant decrease in muscarinic m2 receptor number and functional responsiveness in mammalian heart (Motomura et al., 1990; Marquetant et al., 1992). These changes in neurotransmitter receptor levels are likely to contribute to the adverse clinical effects of abrupt withdrawal of chronic β-adrenergic antagonist administration (Prichard et al., 1983; Fishman, 1987). The regulation of mAChR expression by β-adrenergic receptors thus is not only an interesting example of the regulation of neurotransmitter receptors by heterologous receptor activation but also has important clinical implications.

https://openalex.org/W1990410351,"Epitopes for monoclonal antibodies directed against the purified adult rat skeletal muscle sodium channel (rSkM1) were localized using channel proteolysis and fusion proteins. The interactions between these and other monoclonal antibodies with site-specific polyclonal antibodies were used to investigate the spatial relationships among rSkM1 cytoplasmic segments. Competition between antibodies for binding was performed using a solution-phase assay in which solubilized channel protein retains many of the biophysical characteristics of the rSkM1 protein <i>in vivo</i>. Our results support a model in which: 1) the amino terminus assumes a rigid structure having a fixed orientation with respect to other intracellular segments; 2) the interdomain 2-3 region is centrally located on the cytoplasmic surface of the channel, extends farther into the cytoplasm, and has an intermediate degree of flexibility; 3) the beginning of the amino terminus and end of the carboxyl terminus specifically interact with each other; and 4) domains 1 and 4 are adjacent. The sequences responsible for the interaction of the amino and carboxyl termini were identified by demonstrating the specific binding of a synthetic peptide encompassing the first 30 residues of the rSkM1 amino terminus to a fusion protein containing the rSkM1 carboxyl terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2044927549,"The TraI protein encoded by plasmid R100 was purified in a large scale by monitoring the strand- and site-specific nicking activity at the origin of transfer, oriT. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein was identical to that deduced from the DNA sequence of an open reading frame encoding TraI. The TraI protein is a DNA helicase which is highly processive and unwinds DNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction. The Stokes radius and the sedimentation coefficient for the TraI protein in 200 mM NaCl indicate that the protein is a rod-shaped monomer, whose native molecular weight is 186,000. Chemical cross-linking analysis revealed that there exist more dimers of TraI under the low salt conditions, under which both nicking and unwinding reactions catalyzed by TraI are the most efficient, indicating that the TraI protein is functionally active in a dimer form. TraI hardly introduced a nick into the linearized plasmid DNA and only slightly into the relaxed closed circular DNA, indicating that TraI requires superhelical structure of substrate DNA for the nicking reaction. Deletion analysis in the oriT region revealed that a particular region of 54 base pairs containing oriT is required for the nicking reaction.

Deletion analysis in the oriT region revealed that a particular region of 54 base pairs containing oriT is required for the nicking reaction. Conjugation is the process in which DNA is transferred from one bacterial cell harboring a sex factor plasmid, such as F or R100, to another by cell-to-cell contact (for the most recent review, see Frost et al.(1994)). One of the initial events in DNA transfer is the strand- and site-specific nicking at the origin of transfer, oriT, by the plasmid-specified endonuclease that is the traI gene product whose molecular mass is estimated to be about 192 kDa from the nucleotide sequence (Yoshioka et al., 1990; Bradshaw et al., 1990). The TraI protein encoded by plasmid F or R100 has been purified by monitoring its ATPase activity or by its molecular size, respectively. The TraI proteins purified introduce the strand- and site-specific nick, such that it is covalently linked with the 5′ end of the nick (Inamoto et al., 1991, 1994; Reygers et al., 1991; Matson and Morton, 1991). The TraI proteins have been known to be DNA helicase (Abdel-Monem and Hoffman-Berling, 1976; Inamoto et al., 1994), which is supposed to unwind the duplex DNA from the nick introduced in the plasmid to provide the single-stranded DNA (Abdel-Monem et al., 1983), which is known to be transferred to the recipient cell (Ohki and Tomizawa, 1968; Rupp and Ihler, 1968). In this paper, we purified the TraI protein encoded by R100 by monitoring the site- and strand-specific endonuclease activity and extensively analyzed the nicking and unwinding reactions catalyzed by TraI. We show that a dimer form of the TraI protein is active for both nicking and unwinding reactions, and that the superhelical plasmid DNA molecules with a specific region of 54 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)SSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding proteinIHFintegration host factorntnucleotide(s). are required for the nicking reaction. base pair(s) single-stranded DNA-binding protein integration host factor nucleotide(s). Escherichia coli K12 strains used were JM109 (Yanisch-Perron et al., 1985), CSR603 (Sancar et al., 1979), MV1184 (Vieira and Messing, 1987), and BW313 (Casadaban and Cohen, 1980). Plasmids, pUC119 (Vieira and Messing, 1987), pSI87-XE1 (Inamoto et al., 1988), and pYY35-1 (Inamoto et al., 1991), were derivatives of pUC18 or pUC19 (Yanisch-Perron et al., 1985) with a DNA segment of plasmid R100. Plasmid pHF11 was constructed by inserting a 236-bp BamHI fragment containing oriT of R100 into pUC18. The BamHI fragment was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using a pair of primers with a BamHI site which flank the oriT region, followed by digestion of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments with BamHI. The other pHF plasmids used were constructed as described under “Results.” Culture media used were L broth, L-rich broth, 2 × YT medium, and φ-medium (Yoshioka et al., 1987). φ-Medium was used for transformation of plasmid DNA (Yoshioka et al., 1987). Deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphate and ATP were purchased from Yamasa. tRNA (type XX; Sigma) and bovine serum albumin (Seikagaku Kogyo) were used. [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham. Molecular size standards for proteins were obtained from Bio-Rad or Pharmacia Biotech. SDS and dithiothreitol were purchased from Nakarai. Glutaraldehyde solution 10% (electron microscope grade) was purchased from Wako. The Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from Takara. Restriction endonucleases, BamHI and HindIII (New England Biolabs), were used. Single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) was obtained from Promega. RNase A and proteinase K were obtained from Sigma and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. They were used as recommended by their suppliers. Covalently closed circular plasmid DNAs used for in vitro nicking experiments were isolated from large-scale cultures, as described (Ohtsubo et al., 1978). An alkaline lysis method (Yoshioka et al., 1987; Maniatis et al., 1982) was used to prepare a small amount of plasmid DNA from large numbers of cell cultures. Single-stranded DNA of pUC119 or its derivative was prepared as described previously (Vieira and Messing, 1987). Oligonucleotides listed in Table 1were synthesized using Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA Synthesizer and purified by reversed-phase chromatography or by elution from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel after electrophoresis.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The standard nicking reaction was performed as follows: 2 μl of the covalently closed circular pHF11 DNA (37 fmol) in a solution (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA) was mixed with 3 μl of 5 × buffer N (150 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml) and 8 μl of Milli-Q water. After preincubation for 5 min at 37°C, the reaction was initiated by adding 2 μl of the TraI protein in buffer A containing 200 mM NaCl and 20% glycerol. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of the stop solution (2% SDS, 33 mM EDTA). After addition of 1 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml), the mixture was further incubated at 30°C for 30 min. DNA in the mixture was then extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. After digestion of the sample DNA with BamHI, the 5′ ends of the DNA fragments were labeled with exchange reaction using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (see Fig. 1) using the Megalabel− kit (Takara). The 32P-labeled fragments were denatured and electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7 M urea. The radioactivity of bands of the fragments was determined using Bio-Image Analyzer (BAS1000 or BAS200, Fuji Photo Film). The nicking efficiency was estimated from the ratio of the nicked molecules (143 nt) to the half of total DNA molecules (236 and 143 nt) (see Fig. 1). The TraI protein was purified monitoring the endonuclease activity assayed by the nicking reaction (see above) as follows. Cells (88 g) of E. coli CSR603 harboring pYY35-1, which overproduces the TraI protein, were lysed as described previously (Inamoto et al., 1994) and centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the supernatant (Fraction I). Then, 0.3 g/ml of ammonium sulfate was added to Fraction I with stirring. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min, resuspended in 24 ml of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol) and dialyzed twice against the same buffer (1 liter) for 6 h. The dialysate (Fraction II) was applied to a phosphocellulose P11 column (2.5 cm × 7.6 cm; Whatman) equilibrated with buffer A, and the column was washed with 3 column volumes of the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a 400 ml of 0-1.0 M NaCl linear gradient in buffer A. The fractions (0.19-0.31 M NaCl) with the TraI endonuclease activity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl. The dialysate (Fraction III) was then applied to a MonoQ (HR 5/5; Pharmacia) column equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of the same buffer, and the proteins were eluted with a 20 ml of 50-400 mM NaCl linear gradient in buffer A. The fractions (155-164 mM NaCl) with the TraI specific endonuclease activity were pooled. The dialysate (Fraction IV) was applied to a Superdex 200pg (HiLoad 16/60; Pharmacia) column equilibrated with buffer A containing 200 mM NaCl, and the column was developed with the same buffer. The peak fraction with the TraI endonuclease activity, which corresponded to the Kav of 0.172, was pooled and dialyzed against buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl. The pooled solution (Fraction V) was applied to a HiTrap Heparin (10 ml; Pharmacia) column equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of the same buffer, and the proteins were eluted with a 50-ml 50 mM to 1.0 M NaCl linear gradient in buffer A. The fractions (0.40-0.53 M NaCl) with the TraI endonuclease activity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A containing 50 mM or 200 mM NaCl. Total 12.8 mg of the protein was obtained and stored at −80°C. In every step in these procedures, the relative amount of the TraI protein in each fraction was monitored by electrophoresis in SDS-8% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli(1970). The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Stokes radius was determined by gel filtration of the purified TraI protein using Superdex 200pg column as described above. Ovalbumin, albumin, aldolase, catalase, ferritin, and thyroglobulin (Pharmacia gel filtration calibration kit) were used as standards. Sucrose gradient (5 ~ 20% w/v) was made in buffer A in tubes measuring 13 × 51 mm for a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor. The TraI protein purified was layered on to the gradient in one tube. The solution containing standard proteins (catalase, aldolase, and albumin) was layered on to the gradient in the other tube. Centrifugation was carried out at 20°C for 10 h at 50,000 rpm. Five-drop fractions were collected, and the concentration of proteins was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Chemical cross-linking was carried out as described (Runyon et al., 1993) with the following modification: cross-linking of TraI (2.4 μM monomer) was carried out at 24°C in buffer A or in the nicking reaction buffer containing 10-275 mM NaCl after preincubation for 10 min at 24°C. Cross-linking was initiated by addition of 1% glutaraldehyde to 0.1% and quenched after 30 min by addition of 100 mM lysine chloride to 10 mM. Products were analyzed by SDS-5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The substrate used for the helicase assay (see Fig. 4A) was prepared as follows. Two times molar excess of the 51-mer oligonucleotide (P-mcs) labeled with 32P at the 5′-end was mixed with single-stranded DNA of pUC119 in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA), and the mixture was heated at 65°C for 5 min, cooled down slowly (~1°C/min) to room temperature, and applied to QIAGEN tip20 (QIAGEN Inc.) to remove non-annealed oligonucleotides. The DNA sample was dissolved in TE buffer. The standard helicase reaction was performed as follows: 0.5 μl of the substrate (50 fmol) in TE buffer was mixed with 2 μl of 5 × buffer N, 0.7 μl of 20 mM ATP, and 5.8 μl of Milli-Q water. After preincubation for 5 min at 30°C, the reaction was initiated by adding 1 μl of the TraI protein in buffer A containing 200 mM NaCl and 20% glycerol. The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 10 or 5 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of the stop solution (50 mM EDTA, 0.6% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.12% bromphenol blue). The reaction mixture was electrophoresed on a nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer (Maniatis et al., 1982), and the radioactivity of bands was determined using Bio-Image Analyzer. A 24-mer oligonucleotide (P52) labeled with 32P at the 5′ end was annealed with a 42-mer oligonucleotide (P55) and used as a substrate (α in Fig. 6A). Also, a 24-mer oligonucleotide (P53) labeled with 32P at the 5′ end was annealed with a 42-mer (P54) and used as the other substrate (β in Fig. 6A). Helicase assay was performed as described above, except that 1 μl of substrate α or β (0.2 pmol) was used in each reaction, and products were analyzed by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The TraI protein of plasmid R100 has been shown to introduce a nick at oriT on a specific strand of the plasmid (Inamoto et al., 1994). Plasmid pHF11 carries a 236-bp BamHI fragment containing oriT of R100 (see Fig. 1). TraI introduces the nick at oriT in the BamHI fragment in this plasmid, resulting in generation of the single-stranded DNA of 143 nt long when the plasmid DNA was subsequently digested with BamHI, labeled with 32P at the 5′ ends, and denatured (see Fig. 1). It should be noted that nicking results in generation of another fragment of 93 nt also derived from the specific strand of the 236-bp BamHI fragment, but this fragment could not be labeled with 32P because of the presence of TraI covalently linked to its 5′ end (see Fig. 1). Using this method of detection of the site- and strand-specific endonuclease activity of the TraI protein, we tried to purify the TraI protein in a large scale by column chromatography from the crude lysate of cells harboring plasmid pYY35-1 (traI+) overproducing the TraI protein. The crude cell lysate contained the TraI protein in an amount greater than 20% of total protein as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but did not show any nicking activity (Table 2). However, a fraction obtained from phosphocellulose column showed the nicking activity (Table 2), suggesting that the initial crude lysate contained either an inhibitor(s) or a nuclease(s) causing degradation of the substrate DNA. The TraI protein in the phosphocellulose column fraction could be purified to homogeneity through MonoQ FPLC, Superdex 200pg, and HiTrap Heparin columns (see Table 2). The specific activity of the TraI protein increased 6.2 times through the purification (Table 2).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In these purification steps, the specific activity of the fraction obtained using MonoQ column was 4.6 times greater than that of the fraction obtained from phosphocellulose column. However, the relative amount of TraI estimated by scanning SDS-polyacrylamide gels increased only 1.1 times (Table 2). This suggests that the phosphocellulose fraction still contained an inhibitor(s) or a nuclease(s). In phosphocellulose, Superdex 200pg or MonoQ column chromatography, the nicking activity corresponded to the single peak of protein mass (see Fig. 2A for the result of Superdex 200pg column chromatography). In HiTrap Heparin column chromatography, however, the profile of the nicking activity showed two peaks, which corresponded to those in the profile of protein concentration (Fig. 2B). We assume that this is due to multimerization of the TraI protein, as will be discussed later. We carried out amino acid sequencing analysis of the purified TraI protein and found that the N-terminal amino acid sequence was MLSFSVV•••, which is identical to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence of an open reading frame for the traI gene (Yoshioka et al., 1990). This in turn indicates that the N terminus of the TraI protein is neither blocked nor processed. The molecular mass of the TraI protein encoded by R100 has been estimated to be 192 kDa from the nucleotide sequence of the traI gene and 180 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the protein purified previously by monitoring its molecular size (see Table 3). To determine the molecular weight of the purified TraI protein, we carried out gel filtration, which yielded a Stokes radius of 63.2 Å, and also sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis, which gave a sedimentation coefficient of 6.7 S in the buffer containing 200 mM NaCl. According to the method described by Siegel and Monty(1966), we calculated a native molecular mass for TraI to be 186,000 with a friction rate of 2.1 (Table 3). These results indicate that the TraI protein is rod-shaped and exists as monomers in the buffer containing 200 mM NaCl.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We then carried out the sedimentation analysis of the purified TraI protein in the buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, and found that the sedimentation coefficient sifted to 8.9 S (Table 3). This suggests that TraI forms dimers under the low salt conditions. To verify this assumption, we carried out chemical cross-linking analysis and found that TraI monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis existed as dimers under the low salt conditions but as monomers under the high salt conditions (Fig. 3). We have recently demonstrated that TraI encoded by R100 is a DNA helicase (Inamoto et al., 1994). We quantitatively analyzed the helicase activity of TraI purified as described above using the single-stranded pUC119 DNA annealed with the 51-mer oligonucleotide labeled with 32P at its 5′ end as substrate (see Fig. 4). The unwinding reaction by TraI was found to reach a plateau in several minutes (Fig. 5A, a). Eighty percent of the substrate added were unwound by addition of 2.2 TraI molecules per substrate DNA molecule (Fig. 5A, b). The optimal NaCl concentration was 20 mM, and the efficiency of the reaction was reduced to one-hundredth in 100 mM NaCl (Fig. 5A, c). These results combined with the data shown in Fig. 3suggest that the TraI helicase is functionally active in a dimer form. Lineweaver-Burk plotting of the data gave Vmax of 0.47 nM/min and Km of 6.6 nM at 30°C, indicating efficient binding of TraI to the substrate DNA. The value of Vmax corresponds to an unwinding velocity of 290 bp/s, which means that the unwinding reaction is immediately completed once the reaction starts. From these values, we calculated kcat (turnover) to be 0.12/min and kcat/Km to be 1.9 × 107M-1 min-1. The values indicate that TraI does not rapidly turn over. These results show that the TraI helicase is highly processive. We examined several parameters for the unwinding reaction. The unwinding reaction occurred most efficiently at 37°C. Optimal pH was 7.2. The unwinding reaction absolutely required Mg2+ and ATP. The optimal concentration of Mg2+ is 5 mM, and that of ATP is 4 mM as far as we measured the activity at the concentrations from 0.25 to 4 mM. We also examined the effect of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein, SSB, on the unwinding reaction. SSB promoted the unwinding reaction slightly, about 5%, at the concentration of 16 nM tetramer (3.2 times over substrate), but inhibited the reaction to a certain extent at the concentrations of over 120 nM (24 times over substrate); SSB inhibited the reaction by 31% at 400 nM (80 times over substrate) and by 47% at 1.6 μM (320 times over substrate). We also determined the direction of DNA unwinding by TraI using the substrate, α or β, which is a 24-bp duplex with the 5′- or 3′-overhang of 18 nt, respectively (Fig. 6A). TraI unwound substrate α with the 5′-overhang very efficiently, but unwound substrate β with the 3′-overhang very poorly (Fig. 6B). This indicates that TraI unwinds DNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction. This agrees with the direction of unwinding by TraI (Helicase I) encoded by F (Lahue and Matson, 1988). The nicking reaction catalyzed by TraI reached a plateau essentially in a relatively short time (Fig. 5B, a). However, nicking did not occur beyond 55% of substrate molecules even upon long incubation of the reaction mixture and/or addition of much TraI protein (Fig. 5B, b). The nicking reaction efficiently occurred under low salt, but not under high salt; nicking could hardly be detected at the concentration of NaCl over 100 mM (Fig. 5B, c). This indicates that the TraI nickase is active in a dimer form. We then examined several parameters for the nicking reaction. The nicking reaction occurred most efficiently at 37°C. Optimal pH was 7.6. The optimal concentration of Mg2+ was 10 mM. Unlike the unwinding reaction, the nicking reaction occurred in the absence of ATP. ATP rather inhibited the nicking activity, probably because ATP enhanced the helicase activity that leads to movement of TraI on DNA, resulting in inhibition of the nicking reaction. We also examined the effect of SSB on the nicking reaction. Interestingly, SSB inhibited the nicking reaction to 33% at 13 nM (5.4 times over substrate) and to 7% at 210 nM (87 times over substrate). To see whether TraI binds to a specific DNA sequence around oriT, we carried out gel-shift assay and filter-binding assay using the restriction fragments of plasmid DNA digested with several restriction enzymes. TraI was, however, found to bind not specifically to the fragment containing oriT (data not shown). Nicking did not occur when the plasmid DNA linearized with a restriction enzyme, such as HindIII which cleaves the DNA at a single site, was used as substrate (Fig. 7A). Nicking did not efficiently occur when the closed circular DNA was relaxed by treatment with topoisomerase I and used as substrate, while nicking occurred very efficiently when superhelical DNA was used as substrate (Fig. 7A). When the nicking reaction was carried out using the superhelical DNA in the presence of ethidium bromide, the nicking efficiency was decreased or increased in a manner dependent on the concentration of ethidium bromide (Fig. 7B). These results show that TraI requires superhelical DNA as substrate for the nicking reaction. As described above, the sequence recognized by TraI could not be determined using the linear fragments of plasmid DNA. To define the region required for nicking by TraI, therefore, we constructed a set of plasmids with a deletion in the oriT region (see Fig. 8) and examined them to see whether TraI introduces a nick or not. As shown in Fig. 8, a particular region of 54 bp containing oriT was found to be essential for nicking. This indicates that this 54-bp region is recognized by TraI for the nicking at oriT. In this paper, we have shown that the TraI protein of R100 is a rod-shaped molecule with molecular weight 186,000. This is consistent with the result obtained by electron microscopy that the protomer of TraI protein of plasmid F is rod-shaped (Abdel-Monem et al., 1977). We have also shown here that the TraI protein forms dimers under the low salt conditions and monomers under the high salt conditions, and that dimers of TraI are active in both nicking and unwinding reactions. Previous stoichiometric analysis has suggested that a multimer consisting of about 70 to 90 monomers of TraI of F shows the highest helicase activity (Kuhn et al., 1978; Benz and Muller, 1990), and that 10 molecules of TraI of F per DNA molecule show the highest helicase activity although substantial activity was detected in the reaction involving a 1:1 ratio of enzyme molecules to DNA molecules (Lahue and Matson, 1988). These results differ from ours obtained for TraI of R100. It is noted here, however, that several other helicases, except one, form either dimers or hexamers (Lohman, 1992). Rep helicase and helicase II (UvrD) have been shown to be dimerized upon binding to either single-stranded or duplex DNA (Wong et al., 1992; Runyon et al., 1993). This reminds us the result that in the purification procedure of TraI protein, chromatography using the HiTrap Heparin column showed two peaks, although chromatography using other columns showed a single peak (see Fig. 2). This may suggest that TraI was dimerized upon binding to heparin, a DNA analog. We have shown here that the TraI protein introduces the nick into only a little over half of the substrate DNA even upon long incubation and/or addition of an excess amount of the TraI protein. It is possible that the nicking reaction requires some factors, which are not present in the reaction mixture. Such factors may include the traY gene product and the integration host factor IHF, which have been recently shown to stimulate the nicking reaction catalyzed by TraI (Inamoto et al., 1994) by binding to the sites (sbyA and ihfA) located immediately adjacent to the nicking site oriT (Inamoto and Ohtsubo, 1990; Inamoto et al., 1990). It might also be possible that TraI possesses the topoisomerase activity to convert superhelical DNA to relaxed closed circular DNA, which was shown in this paper to be poorly nicked by the TraI protein. However, the TraI protein has no topoisomerase activity, since the relaxed circular DNA molecules were not detected in an agarose gel containing chloroquine after electrophoresis of the sample treated with TraI (data not shown). We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that the nicked molecules with TraI covalently attached are still in a superhelical DNA form and can be readily converted to the superhelical DNA molecules without TraI, leading to an equilibrium state between two kinds of superhelical DNA molecules with and without TraI. We have recently found that the TraI protein has the single-stranded DNA binding activity and cleaves the single-stranded DNA at oriT. 2H. Fukuda and E. Ohtsubo, unpublished data. This DNA cleaving activity is inhibited by SSB. These findings lead us to assume that the oriT region in the double-stranded DNA molecules melts locally, providing a single-stranded DNA portion which is cleaved by TraI. This assumption may be supported by our present result that the nicking reaction is strongly inhibited by SSB. The nicking reaction occurs most efficiently under the low salt conditions, but it hardly occurs at high salt (100 mM NaCl or more), as described in this paper. The cleavage reaction of the single-stranded DNA by TraI occurs most efficiently under the low salt conditions like the nicking reaction, but it still occurs even at the NaCl concentration 100 mM unlike the nicking reaction.2 It is possible that the superhelical DNA, that is the substrate for the nicking reaction, cannot be melted locally under the high salt conditions, thus not providing any single-stranded DNA portion which is bound and cleaved by the TraI protein. Alternatively, dimers of TraI formed under the low salt conditions may form a DNA-protein complex at the partially melted region around oriT which leads to the cleavage reaction, but monomers formed under the high salt conditions may not form such a complex. We thank Dr. H. Maki for generous suggestion for purification of the TraI protein and analysis of the purified protein. We also thank Dr. K. Horiuchi for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2076993073,"The oxygen-avid, perienteric hemoglobin of Ascaris is a homooctamer. Each subunit contains two tandem globin domains that are highly homologous with the exception of a charged COOH-terminal extension. In solution, recombinant domain one (D1) exists as a monomer, whereas recombinant domain two with the COOH-terminal tail (D2) is primarily an octamer. To examine the role of the COOH-terminal extension in Ascaris hemoglobin multimer formation, we attached the tail to the monomeric, heme-containing proteins, myoglobin and D1; neither construct was capable of multimer formation. Additionally, we removed the tail from both full-length Ascaris hemoglobin and D2. This substantially decreased, but did not eliminate, multimerization. We further characterized subunit interactions by disrupting full-length hemoglobin multimers with the chaotropic salt, NaSCN, which yielded intermediate oligomers. In solution, D2 demonstrated a greater propensity to dissociate than full-length hemoglobin, indicating that D1 contributes to octamer stability. D1 formed a weak dimer in its crystal; thus, we analyzed interactions along the subunit interface. Hydrogen bonds as well as hydrophobic and electrostatic forces appeared to contribute to dimer formation. Amino acid substitutions along this interface in D2 are predicted to enhance subunit interactions for that domain.

INTRODUCTIONThe perienteric fluid of the parasitic nematode Ascaris contains an abundant hemoglobin with exceptional oxygen avidity(1Davenport H. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1949; 136: 255-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This globin is an octamer composed of identical 43-kDa polypeptides(2Darawshe S. Tsafadyah Y. Daniel E. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 3Darawshe S. Daniel E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Each subunit consists of two tandem globin domains. A highly charged tail is found at the COOH terminus of the second domain (Fig. 1A)(4Sherman D.R. Kloek A.P. Krishnan R.B.G. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5De Baere I. Liu L. Moens L. Van Beeumen J. Gielens C. Richelle J. Trotman C. Finch J. Gerstein M. Perutz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4638-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the first globin domain has been solved, revealing striking similarities to the tertiary structures of globins from diverse species(6Yang J. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The heme pocket contains a network of hydrogen bonds, including one contributed by a critical tyrosine, which locks the liganded oxygen in place. Mutagenesis studies have provided further support for this(7Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Frieden C. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2377-2379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8De Baere I. Perutz M.F. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Although the molecular basis of the oxygen avidity of Ascaris hemoglobin has now been described in some detail, structural motifs responsible for the formation of this remarkable multimer have not yet been elucidated. However, molecular cloning and expression of the separated domains have provided interesting clues (9Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Domain one (D1), which does not have the COOH-terminal extension, exists as a monomer in solution. In contrast, domain two (D2), which contains the tail, is capable of polymerizing to an octamer. Excluding the tail, the primary structures of D1 and D2 are highly homologous with 63% amino acid identity, implicating the tail as a potentially important component in multimerization(4Sherman D.R. Kloek A.P. Krishnan R.B.G. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5De Baere I. Liu L. Moens L. Van Beeumen J. Gielens C.

The 23-residue COOH-terminal extension is highly polar, possessing 22 charged residues, including four His-Lys-Glu-Glu (HKEE) direct repeats. It has been suggested that this tail may serve as a polar zipper, forming a β-barrel comprised of eight antiparallel β-strands stabilized by interstrand salt bridges between side chains(8De Baere I.

Biol. 1993; 3: 249-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and cross-linking studies have indicated that the octamer conforms to a two-layered arrangement of subunits, perhaps with one type of interaction of subunits within a layer and another type between the two layers(3Darawshe S. Daniel E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized the interaction of subunits and have assessed the contribution of the highly charged tail in Ascaris hemoglobin octamer formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAscaris Hemoglobin ConstructsAscaris hemoglobin lacking the COOH-terminal tail (AH-t) was engineered using the full-length expression plasmid insert (AH) (9Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reaction. Primers contained NcoI restriction sites for insertion into the expression vector. The forward primer was the same used for amplification of the full-length construct as described previously(9Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AH-t reverse primer (5′ gcatccatggtcatttgccgtgccttgtggc 3′) was complementary to the region just upstream of the sequence encoding the COOH-terminal tail and also provided a stop codon for translation termination.D2 lacking the COOH-terminal tail (D2-t) was constructed using the D2 expression plasmid (9Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template in PCR. The D2-t forward primer was the same used for amplification of D2(9Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The D2-t reverse primer was the one used above for the formation of AH-t.Addition of the COOH-terminal tail to D1 in order to create D1+t was performed utilizing a two-step PCR-based strategy modified from Morrison and Desrosiers (11Morrison H.G. Desrosiers R.C. Biotechniques. 1993; 14: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). In the first PCR step, Reaction I used the D1 expression plasmid as template(9Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primer a, the forward primer, contained an NcoI restriction site and was the same used for amplification of D1 as described previously(9Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primer b, the reverse primer in this reaction (5′ ttctttatgctcgtggtgttctcgtccatgcttgttgatttc 3′), contained 21 nucleotides complementary to the extreme 3′ end of the coding sequence for D1, plus 21 nucleotides complementary to the extreme 5′ coding sequence for the tail. In Reaction II, the D2 expression plasmid was used as template. Primer b‘, the complement to Primer b, was used as the forward primer. Primer c, the reverse primer, contained an NcoI restriction site and was same utilized for the amplification of D2 as described previously(9Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions I and II resulted in products with a region of shared overlap with one another. In order to generate full-length D1+t, a 10-fold dilution of both products was used as template in Reaction III with only the extreme 5′ and 3′ end-specific oligonucleotides, Primers a and c. In the first round of amplification, the single-stranded templates hybridized in the region of shared overlap and self-primed the extension reaction, thus creating the desired full-length double-stranded insert. In all subsequent rounds, the 5′- and 3′-specific primers amplified this product.PCR was performed in a TC480 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer). Final reaction conditions in all PCR were 1.25 units of AmpliTaq (Perkin-Elmer), 0.1 μM oligonucleotide primers, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 10 mM KCl, 6 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mM deoxynucleotides, and the relevant template in a final volume of 0.05 ml. Reactions were cycled 30 times at 95°C for 1 min, 50 for 1 min, and 75 for 1 min. After ethanol precipitation, PCR products were digested at 37 for 16 h with 10 units of NcoI (Boehringer Mannheim). The DNA was then purified by adsorption to a glass slurry using the Elu-Quik DNA purification kit (Schleicher & Schuell) and cloned into NcoI-digested, phosphatase-treated Studier expression vector pET-8C. Phosphatase reactions were carried out at for 1 h using 1 unit of calf intestinal phosphataseExpression constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue for plasmid screening. Positive clones were selected on LB-ampicillin plates and were screened for forward orientation by PCR analysis. Positives were verified for the expected mutations by plasmid DNA sequencing with the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and the products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels (National Diagnostics).Myoglobin ConstructAddition of the COOH-terminal tail of Ascaris hemoglobin to dog myoglobin in order to create Mgb+t was accomplished using a similar PCR-based strategy with the following changes. In Reaction I, dog myoglobin cDNA was used as a template. The forward primer (5′ ccatggggctcagcgacggggaatg 3′) contained an NcoI restriction site. The reverse primer (5′ tcgtggtgttctttgccgtggccctggaagcccagctcct 3′) contained 20 nucleotides complementary to the extreme 3′ end of dog myoglobin, plus 20 nucleotides complementary to the extreme 5′ end of the Ascaris hemoglobin COOH-terminal tail. The complement of this primer was used as the forward primer in Reaction II with the D2 plasmid as template and reverse primer for D2 as above. A 10-fold dilution of both products was used in Reaction III with the extreme 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides, resulting in Mgb+t. PCR conditions, cloning, and subsequent analyses were performed essentially as described above for the Ascaris hemoglobin constructs.Protein Expression and PurificationConstructs were transformed into E. coli expression strain BL21 (DE3), and protein expression was carried out as described previously(9Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that cultures were grown for 48 h before induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and then grown an additional 14-16 h before harvesting bacteria. Protein purification was performed as before(9Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Further purification of hemoglobins for NaSCN dissociation experiments was accomplished by dilution of the samples 1:40 in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and fractionation using Mono Q anion exchange chromatography. A Pharmacia Mono Q HR 5/5 column was equilibrated with 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl for 15 min, and samples were eluted with a linear gradient from 50 mM to 1000 mM NaCl for 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Samples were then concentrated using Centriprep 10 concentrators.Quaternary Structure DeterminationSamples were injected onto a Pharmacia Superose 12 gel filtration column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. Hemoglobin peaks were detected by monitoring absorbance at 410 nm. In order to determine molecular sizes, elution times were calibrated with protein molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad).Dissociation of MultimersTen micrograms of purified hemoglobin were incubated with NaSCN in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5) at room temperature in a total volume of 24 μl. In experiments varying the concentration of NaSCN, incubations were carried out for 20 min. In experiments varying the length of incubation, reactions contained a final concentration of 2 M NaSCN.Analysis of the D1 Dimer InterfaceThe crystal structure of D1 (Brookhaven 1ASH) (6Yang J.

A. 1995; 92: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was analyzed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation using the graphics program TURBO to determine the amino acid contacts at the dimer interface.RESULTSAnalysis of Myoglobin with a TailThe purpose of this experiment was to assess the ability of the highly charged Ascaris hemoglobin tail to promote multimer formation of a structurally related, monomeric protein. Secondary and tertiary structures of mammalian myoglobins and Ascaris hemoglobin domain one are very similar, despite low amino acid homology(6Yang J. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc.

A two-step PCR strategy as described above was utilized to add the Ascaris hemoglobin tail to the COOH terminus of dog myoglobin, resulting in Mgb+t. The mutant protein was expressed in E. coli and migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as predicted, based on molecular mass (data not shown). Recombinant Mgb+t had the visible absorbance spectrum characteristic of a myoglobin, indicating the presence of a properly folded, functional, heme-containing protein. In order to assess quaternary structure, the recombinant protein was analyzed using gel filtration chromatography. Mgb+t eluted at the position expected for a monomer (21 kDa), just ahead of myoglobin without a tail (17.5 kDa), with no detectable multimeric species (Fig. 2). The minor lower molecular weight peak is likely due to degraded recombinant protein.Figure 2:Quaternary structure of myoglobin with the tail. Mgb+t (monomer mass, 21 kDa) was injected onto a Superose 12 gel filtration column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Elution times (in minutes) were compared with those of molecular weight standards. The 17.5-kDa standard corresponds to myoglobin without a tail. Myoglobin elution from the column was monitored by absorbance at 410 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of Ascaris Hemoglobin ConstructsTo determine the role of the COOH-terminal tail in Ascaris hemoglobin multimerization, constructs of full-length hemoglobin and the separated domains, D1 and D2, were created using PCR(9Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). D1 plus the COOH-terminal tail (D1+t), D2 lacking its tail (D2-t), and full-length hemoglobin lacking the tail (AH-t) were also constructed (Fig. 1). Mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified, and analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. As expected, D1 was predominantly monomeric (Fig. 3A). Full-length hemoglobin (AH) eluted at the position expected for an octamer (Fig. 3B). At the same concentration, D2 was predominantly octameric, but also formed detectable amounts of dimer and an additional multimeric species, most likely tetramer (Fig. 3C). AH-t was drastically reduced in its ability to form an octamer (Fig. 3B). Elution times indicated the presence of a variety of species, including monomer, dimer, and tetramer with little octamer. D2-t was similarly reduced in its ability to multimerize (Fig. 3C). Major peaks were detected at elution times representing primarily dimer, and to a lesser extent, monomer. Minor peaks at elution times corresponding to tetramer and octamer were also detected. In both tail-less constructs and D2, a substantial amount of high molecular weight aggregate was observed. D1+t remained monomeric with an elution profile almost indistinguishable from that of D1 (Fig. 3A).Figure 3:Quaternary structure of Ascaris hemoglobin constructs. Samples were injected onto a Superose 12 gel filtration column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Elution times (in minutes) were compared with those of molecular weight standards. Hemoglobin elution from the column was monitored by absorbance at 410 nm. A, comparison of D1 (bold line, monomer mass 18 kDa) with D1+t (thin line, monomer mass 21 kDa).

Time is shown in minutes on the x axis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dissociation of Full-length Ascaris HemoglobinIn order to gain insight into the nature of the interaction(s) involved in octamer formation, NaSCN, a chaotropic salt, was utilized to dissociate Ascaris hemoglobin multimers. For these experiments, full-length recombinant hemoglobin was incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of NaSCN. After 20 min, samples were subjected to gel filtration chromatography to assess quaternary structure (Fig. 4). Hemoglobin peaks were detected by monitoring absorbance at 410 nm in order to selectively detect only properly folded molecules. As expected, Ascaris hemoglobin with no added NaSCN eluted at a position consistent with an octamer. In the presence of 1 M NaSCN, analysis revealed shoulders at tetramer and dimer positions. However, a further increase to 1.5 M NaSCN resulted in a substantial decrease in the elution peak corresponding to octamer with a concomitant rise in peaks representing tetramer and dimer. A small peak corresponding to monomer (Mr˜43,000) was also detected. Dissociation was accentuated in the presence of 2 M NaSCN; elution times suggested a further decrease in octamer along with a marked rise in dimer.Figure 4:Disruption of octameric Ascaris hemoglobin. Ascaris hemoglobin was incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of NaSCN for 20 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples were then injected onto a Superose 12 gel filtration column. Elution times (in minutes) were compared with those of molecular weight standards. Hemoglobin elution from the column was monitored by absorbance at 410 nm. A, control with no added NaSCN; B, 1 M NaSCN; C, 1.5 M NaSCN; D, 2 M NaSCN. The dashed line corresponds to the position of eluted octamer. Expected positions are indicated for tetramer (t), dimer (d), and monomer (m).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the next part of this experiment, purified full-length hemoglobin was incubated in the presence of 2 M NaSCN for increasing amounts of time to induce further dissociation of multimers. Quaternary structure was again assessed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 5). At 20 min, as in Fig. 4D, substantial dissociation into dimer and tetramer was observed. By 60 min, there was additional loss of octamer and tetramer populations with a striking increase in dimer. Upon incubation for 90 min, more substantial dissociation into monomer was observed. Similar results were obtained upon incubation for 135 min (data not shown). After 180 min, no peaks were observed, due to subunit denaturation with subsequent loss of the heme moiety.Figure 5:Dissociation of Ascaris hemoglobin multimers. Ascaris hemoglobin was incubated for varying times in 2 M NaSCN (final concentration) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples were then injected onto a Superose 12 gel filtration column. Elution times (in minutes) were compared with those of molecular weight standards. Hemoglobin elution from the column was monitored by absorbance at 410 nm. A, control incubated for 20 min with no added NaSCN; B, 20-min incubation; C, 60-min incubation; D, 90-min incubation; E, 180-min incubation.

Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it forms a weak dimer in the crystalline lattice. The largest intermolecular contact, approximately 1100 Å2 in area, occurs across a crystallographic dyad and is three times larger than any other contacts. The interface of the D1 dimer is at the E- and F-helices of each subunit with additional contacts from residues in the A-helix and AB-loop to the E- and F-helices (Fig. 6). Significant amino acid interactions between D1 subunits are summarized in Table 1. The arginine residue at position 3 (Arg3) in the A-helix forms a strong ionic interaction with Asp73‘ in the E-helix, whereas Glu90 and Arg94‘ interact more weakly. The main chain amide and carbonyl oxygen atoms of Val15 form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Glu82‘ and Arg89‘, respectively. A number of additional side chains are located within the interface and make contact with residues in the other subunit, including Val73 with Val73‘ and Ala86 with Val15‘ and Leu69‘.Figure 6:Stereo diagram of the D1 dimer interface.

Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, because D1 alone does not form multimers in solution(9Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this structure has not defined regions of the full-length molecule involved in octamer formation. The two tandem globin folds are highly homologous with the exception of a highly charged, 23 residue COOH-terminal extension on D2, which contains 22 ionizable residues, including four direct HKEE repeats(4Sherman D.R.

Thus, we targeted the Ascaris hemoglobin tail as a potentially important structure required for octamer formation.We first tested the ability of the tail to directly promote multimerization of a structurally related but monomeric protein. Myoglobin served as an appropriate candidate, due to its homologous compact, highly α-helical structure(6Yang J. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The engineered myoglobin, Mgb+t, was incapable of forming multimers. This raised the possibility that the myoglobin either contained regions that interfered with multimerization or lacked certain motifs necessary for multimer formation. In order to address this, we constructed a mutant of a completely unrelated molecule, glutathione S-transferase, which upon addition of the charged tail was also incapable of forming multimers (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that interaction of other regions in the Ascaris hemoglobin molecule are essential for multimerization. Indeed, construction and analysis of D1+t demonstrated that the tail alone is unable to promote multimer formation of the monomeric, Ascaris hemoglobin domain. In contrast, full-length hemoglobin without a tail, as well as D2 without a tail, were still capable of forming the full complement of multimers, albeit in a poorly controlled fashion. The most abundantly observed multimer in these tail-less hemoglobins was a dimer, suggesting that the regions responsible for dimer formation lie within the globin fold of D2. Based on these data, we propose that the ability to multimerize is intrinsic to the globin region of D2 and that the COOH-terminal tail serves to stabilize the Ascaris hemoglobin octamer.Previousl"
