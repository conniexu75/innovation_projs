The technology, capital, institutions, and skills needed to make newer products are more easily adapted from some products than from others. Here, we study this network of relatedness between products, or “product space,” finding that more-sophisticated products are located in a densely connected core whereas less-sophisticated products occupy a less-connected periphery. Empirically, countries move through the product space by developing goods close to those they currently produce. Most countries can reach the core only by traversing empirically infrequent distances, which may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail to converge to the income levels of rich countries."

Here we report high enantioselectivities conferred by a chiral counterion in a metal-catalyzed reaction. Two different transformations catalyzed by cationic gold(I) complexes generated products in 90 to 99% enantiomeric excess with the use of chiral binaphthol–derived phosphate anions. Furthermore, we show that the chiral counterion can be combined additively with chiral ligands to enable an asymmetric transformation that cannot be achieved by either method alone. This concept of relaying chiral information via an ion pair should be applicable to a vast number of metal-mediated processes."

This article uses Second Life and World of Warcraft as two very different examples of current virtual worlds that foreshadow future developments, introducing a number of research methodologies that scientists are now exploring, including formal experimentation, observational ethnography, and quantitative analysis of economic markets or social networks."
https://openalex.org/W2075953769,"Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are promising gene therapy vectors that have little or no acute toxicity. We show that normal mice and mice with mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII) develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after neonatal injection of an AAV vector expressing b-glucuronidase. AAV proviruses were isolated from four tumors and were all located within a 6-kilobase region of chromosome 12. This locus encodes several imprinted transcripts, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and microRNAs. Transcripts from adjacent genes encoding snoRNAs and microRNAs were overexpressed in tumors. Our findings implicate this locus in the development of HCC and raise concerns over the clinical use of AAV vectors."

https://openalex.org/W2159638567,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in gene regulatory networks in animals. Yet, the mechanistic details of their function in translation inhibition or messenger RNA (mRNA) destabilization remain controversial. To directly examine the earliest events in this process, we have developed an in vitro translation system using mouse Krebs-2 ascites cell-free extract that exhibits an authentic miRNA response. We show here that translation initiation, specifically the 5' cap recognition process, is repressed by endogenous let-7 miRNAs within the first 15 minutes of mRNA exposure to the extract when no destabilization of the transcript is observed. Our results indicate that inhibition of translation initiation is the earliest molecular event effected by miRNAs. Other mechanisms, such as mRNA degradation, may subsequently consolidate mRNA silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2008361132,"Inorganic porous materials are being developed for use as molecular sieves, ion exchangers, and catalysts, but most are oxides. We show that various sulfide and selenide clusters, when bound to metal ions, yield gels having porous frameworks. These gels are transformed to aerogels after supercritical drying with carbon dioxide. The aerogels have high internal surface area (up to 327 square meters per gram) and broad pore size distribution, depending on the precursors used. The pores of these sulfide and selenide materials preferentially absorb heavy metals. These materials have narrow energy gaps (between 0.2 and 2.0 electron volts) and low densities, and they may be useful in optoelectronics, as photocatalysts, or in the removal of heavy metals from water."
https://openalex.org/W2051502948,"NS3, an essential helicase for replication of hepatitis C virus, is a model enzyme for investigating helicase function. Using single-molecule fluorescence analysis, we showed that NS3 unwinds DNA in discrete steps of about three base pairs (bp). Dwell time analysis indicated that about three hidden steps are required before a 3-bp step is taken. Taking into account the available structural data, we propose a spring-loaded mechanism in which several steps of one nucleotide per adenosine triphosphate molecule accumulate tension on the protein-DNA complex, which is relieved periodically via a burst of 3-bp unwinding. NS3 appears to shelter the displaced strand during unwinding, and, upon encountering a barrier or after unwinding >18 bp, it snaps or slips backward rapidly and repeats unwinding many times in succession. Such repetitive unwinding behavior over a short stretch of duplex may help to keep secondary structures resolved during viral genome replication."
https://openalex.org/W2023022880,"Products of unfavorable chemical equilibria are not readily observed because their high energy and increased reactivity result in low concentrations. Biological macromolecules use binding forces to access unfavorable equilibria and stabilize reactive intermediates by isolating them from the medium. In a similar vein, we describe here a synthetic receptor that allows direct observation of labile tetrahedral intermediates: hemiaminals formed in the reaction of an aldehyde carbonyl group with amines. The receptor encapsulates alkyl-substituted primary amines, then orients them toward a covalently tethered aldehyde function. The hemiaminal intermediates appear at high concentration, confined from the bulk solution and observable at ambient temperature by conventional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2075043312,"During Dictyostelium development, prespore cells secrete acyl-CoA binding protein (AcbA). Upon release, AcbA is processed to generate a peptide called spore differentiation factor-2 (SDF-2), which triggers terminal differentiation of spore cells. We have found that cells lacking Golgi reassembly stacking protein (GRASP), a protein attached peripherally to the cytoplasmic surface of Golgi membranes, fail to secrete AcbA and, thus, produce inviable spores. Surprisingly, AcbA lacks a signal sequence and is not secreted via the conventional secretory pathway (endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-cell surface). GRASP is not required for conventional protein secretion, growth, and the viability of vegetative cells. Our findings reveal a physiological role of GRASP and provide a means to understand unconventional secretion and its role in development."
https://openalex.org/W2024240796,"The construction of multicellular organisms depends on stem cells—cells that can both regenerate and produce daughter cells that undergo differentiation. Here, we show that the gaseous messenger ethylene modulates cell division in the cells of the quiescent center, which act as a source of stem cells in the seedling root. The cells formed through these ethylene-induced divisions express quiescent center-specific genes and can repress differentiation of surrounding initial cells, showing that quiescence is not required for these cells to signal to adjacent stem cells. We propose that ethylene is part of a signaling pathway that modulates cell division in the quiescent center in the stem cell niche during the postembryonic development of the root system."

https://openalex.org/W1983473510,"Adaptation is an aspect of virtually all questions of human biology. Besides their interest in evolution through adaptive selection of the primates, including man, physical anthropologists are concerned with biological adaptability as a human attribute. In this sense adaptation has been examined at three overlapping levels: (i) those represented by differences in the extent of inherent capacities in subpopulations long exposed to different conditions, such as differences in the inherited determinants of body form and skin pigment in peoples in different climatic zones; (ii) adaptations acquired during the growth period of the individual such as residual stunting and reduced caloric needs in individuals receiving low caloric diets throughout childhood; and (iii) reversible acclimatization to the immediate conditions such as the changes which make it easier to work at high altitudes after the first few days there. Greater resilience to change is achieved if adaptations are reversible in each generation or within a lifetime. This implies an evolutionary tendency to shift human adaptability from genetic selection to ontogenetic plasticity to reversible adaptability."
https://openalex.org/W2164860814,"Unlike most of its close relatives, Arabidopsis thaliana is capable of self-pollination. In other members of the mustard family, outcrossing is ensured by the complex self-incompatibility (S) locus,which harbors multiple diverged specificity haplotypes that effectively prevent selfing. We investigated the role of the S locus in the evolution of and transition to selfing in A. thaliana. We found that the S locus of A. thaliana harbored considerable diversity, which is an apparent remnant of polymorphism in the outcrossing ancestor. Thus, the fixation of a single inactivated S-locus allele cannot have been a key step in the transition to selfing. An analysis of the genome-wide pattern of linkage disequilibrium suggests that selfing most likely evolved roughly a million years ago or more."

The composition of cerebrospinal fluid after choroid plexectomy was essentially normal. Experiments with ventricular perfusion techniques indicate only a slight reduction in cerebrospinal fluid production after choroid plexectomy. Thus, the choroid plexus is probably not the sole or even the major source of cerebrospinal fluid within the primate ventricular system."

https://openalex.org/W2070669906,"The human arylamine N-acetyltransferases NAT1 and NAT2 play an important role in the biotransformation of a plethora of aromatic amine and hydrazine drugs. They are also able to participate in the bioactivation of several known carcinogens. Each of these enzymes is genetically variable in human populations, and polymorphisms in NAT genes have been associated with various cancers. Here we have solved the high resolution crystal structures of human NAT1 and NAT2, including NAT1 in complex with the irreversible inhibitor 2-bromoacetanilide, a NAT1 active site mutant, and NAT2 in complex with CoA, and have refined them to 1.7-, 1.8-, and 1.9-A resolution, respectively. The crystal structures reveal novel structural features unique to human NATs and provide insights into the structural basis of the substrate specificity and genetic polymorphism of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2161055955,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by decreased L-type calcium current (ICa,L) in atrial myocytes and decreased atrial contractility. Oxidant stress and redox modulation of calcium channels are implicated in these pathologic changes. We evaluated the relationship between glutathione content (the primary cellular reducing moiety) and ICa,L in atrial specimens from AF patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Left atrial glutathione content was significantly lower in patients with either paroxysmal or persistent AF relative to control patients with no history of AF. Incubation of atrial myocytes from AF patients (but not controls) with the glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine caused a marked increase in ICa,L. To test the hypothesis that glutathione levels were mechanistically linked with the reduction in ICa,L, dogs were treated for 48 h with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis. Buthionine sulfoximine treatment resulted in a 24% reduction in canine atrial glutathione content, a reduction in atrial contractility, and an attenuation of ICa,L in the canine atrial myocytes. Incubation of these myocytes with exogenous glutathione also restored ICa,L to normal or greater than normal levels. To probe the mechanism linking decreased glutathione levels to down-regulation of ICa, the biotin switch technique was used to evaluate S-nitrosylation of calcium channels. S-Nitrosylation was apparent in left atrial tissues from AF patients; the extent of S-nitrosylation was inversely related to tissue glutathione content. S-Nitrosylation was also detectable in HEK cells expressing recombinant human cardiac calcium channel subunits following exposure to nitrosoglutathione. S-Nitrosylation may contribute to the glutathione-sensitive attenuation of ICa,L observed in AF.

Persistent AF results in phenotypic electrical and structural remodeling of the atria. Calcium influx via ICa triggers calcium release from intracellular stores and is an essential first step in excitation-contraction coupling and a critical determinant of atrial contractility. In atrial myocytes from patients with persistent AF (1Van Wagoner D.R. Pond A.L. Lamorgese M. Rossie S.S. McCarthy P.M. Nerbonne J.M. Circ.

In a porcine model of rapid atrial pacing, superoxide production is increased (7Dudley S.C. Hoch Jr., N.E. McCann L.A. Honeycutt C. Diamandopoulos L. Fukai T. Harrison D.G. Dikalov S.I. Langberg J.

Oxidant-generating pathways can shift the myocyte intracellular redox environment from its normally reduced state to a more oxidized one. A shift in oxidation state has been implicated in early atrial electrical remodeling in a canine rapid atrial pacing model of AF (9Carnes C.A. Chung M.K. Nakayama T. Nakayama H. Baliga R.S. Piao S.

Res. 2002; 53: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Each of these currents modulates the atrial action potential and atrial contractility. Phosphorylation is the signaling pathway most commonly associated with modulation of calcium channel activity. Oxidant generation and redox changes are important elements in the β-adrenergic regulation of ICa (14Hool L.C. Arthur P.G. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and altered calcium channel phosphorylation has been shown to contribute to the decrement in calcium channel activity during AF (15Christ T. Boknik P. Wohrl S. Wettwer E. Graf E.M. Bosch R.F. Knaut M. Schmitz W. Ravens U. Dobrev D. Circulation. 2004; 110: 2651-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, intracellular redox state can modulate protein function by several additional pathways. Redox state directly regulates the conformation and activity of proteins. Redox-dependent posttranslational modifications of proteins include nitration of tyrosine residues and S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues, among others. Nitration involves the interaction of peroxynitrite anion or another reactive nitrogen species with protein tyrosine residues and is generally indicative of oxidative damage (16Pacher P. Szabo C. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2006; 6: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosylation involves the reversible transfer of NO to a cysteine residue of an acceptor protein and has been considered cytoprotective (17Maejima Y. Adachi S. Morikawa K. Ito H. Isobe M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 163-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Two proteins essential for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, the ryanodine receptor (18Eu J.P. Sun J. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G.

It is intriguing that mice conditionally overexpressing neuronal nitric-oxide synthase have lower ICa densities and contractility than do the wild type controls (20Burkard N. Rokita A.G.

Invest. 2005; 115: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar), all common co-morbidities with AF, are characterized by evidence of increased oxidative stress. Under stressed conditions, cellular and plasma glutathione is oxidized, and cellular glutathione stores become depleted. Glutathione is the most abundant endogenous reducing agent and a critical modulator of cellular redox state. Since glutathione can act as an intracellular NO acceptor, alterations in the level of total cellular glutathione may have important consequences for both the redox-dependent and the NO-dependent regulation of ion channel activity. Studies done in one of our laboratories (1Van Wagoner D.R. Pond A.L. Lamorgese M. Rossie S.S. McCarthy P.M. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and others (15Christ T. Boknik P. Wohrl S. Wettwer E. Graf E.M. Bosch R.F. Knaut M. Schmitz W. Ravens U. Dobrev D.

Cardiol. 2001; 96: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have shown that ICa is decreased in atrial myocytes isolated from AF patients. Several years ago, we postulated that changes to the intracellular redox environment of myocytes from the fibrillating atria may contribute to the observed loss of calcium current (25Van Wagoner D.R. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 2001; 12: 183-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here we have evaluated the redox- and glutathione-dependent modulation of ICa in myocytes from patients undergoing cardiac surgery for chronic AF. Because glutathione is an endogenous reducing agent important in maintaining a reduced intracellular environment, we evaluated whether glutathione levels are reduced in AF. We have also tested the impact of pharmacologic depletion of atrial glutathione on atrial function in an in vivo canine model system. Because redox state modulates the activity of cellular kinases and phosphatases, we have examined the calcium current response to β-adrenergic stimulation and correlated this response with atrial glutathione content. Many cardiovascular diseases are characterized by glutathione depletion; in this setting, S-nitrosylation of several cellular targets has been reported to increase (26Whiteman M. Chua Y.L. Zhang D. Duan W. Liou Y.C. Armstrong J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, we explored calcium channel S-nitrosylation as a potential mechanism that may couple altered glutathione levels with modulation of calcium channel activity and contractility in AF. Human Atrial Studies—Table 1 summarizes relevant clinical characteristics of the cardiac surgery patients from whom left atrial appendage specimens were obtained. Left atrial tissue was brought to the laboratory from the operating room within 5 min of excision. Part of the specimen (∼300 mg) was used for myocyte isolation, whereas adjacent areas were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for assessment of glutathione and S-nitrosylation levels. All procedures were performed between 2001 and 2005 with informed consent and approval from the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board.TABLE 1Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients in studyGroupAgeMale/FemaleEFLAMRTRIca Fig. 2AF durationConcomitant diagnosesMedications%cmmonthsControls35Male533.53-4+1+Severe MR, HtnNone charted48Male654.13+trMR, mitral insufficiencyNone charted56Male604.54+1+MR, hyperlipidemiaStatin56Male253.4trtrCAD, Htn, hyperlipidemia, IDDM, hypothyroid, MIDiuretic, ARB, T4, vitamin C, fish oil, I.-carnitine67Male6042-3+1+Severe rheumatic mitral stenosis, TIAs, hyperlipidemiaNone charted76Male45nltrtrCAD, Htn, hyperlipidemiaAspirin49Female454.84+1+Mitral valve disease, dyspneaNone chartedAF/AF43Female556.41+4+216Rheumatic TR, CHFDiuretic, coumadin, BB44Female556.21-2+tr*>120HOCM, AF, mild CHFBB, disopyramide, coumadin46Male604.2120AVN ablation, PPM, hypertensionNot available65Male505.94+1+*12MR, CHF, hyperlipidemia, asthma, HtnNot available69Male555.43+*Severe CAD, hyperlipidemia, MIPropafenone, digoxin, coumadin, statin74Female604.62+1-2+120Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroid, hypertension, CAD, mild CHF, MIClopidogrel, amiodarone, vasodilator, T4, coumadin, ARB, spironolactone81Male354.51+tr*11Aortic aneurysm, aortic valve regurgitation, strokeNone charted71Femalenlmod. dil.3+nl*6TIA, tachymyopathy, dyspneaSotalol, ACEi, T4, BB, estrogenPAF/SR37Female553.91+1+3Severe mitral stenosisDiuretic, BB, aspirin40Female255.53-4+1+NARheumatic VHD, CHF, hypothyroid, MIT4, ACEi, amiodarone63Male55nltrtr*19CHF, hypertension, CAD, hyperlipidemiaCoumadin, sotalol63Male653.8trnl7Severe aortic stenosis, VF, hyperlipidemiaCoumadin, statin, amiodarone65Male604.3trtr*120Arthritis, renal caliculiPropafenone65Male205.61-2+nl361CAD, Htn, TIA, MI, aortic aneurysmDigoxin, BB, diuretic, coumadin, enoxaparin84Female453.61+nl*204CHF, hypertension, pulm.

Pond A.L. Lamorgese M. Rossie S.S. McCarthy P.M. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Yields of canine atrial myocytes were in the range of 40-60% calcium-tolerant, rod-shaped, well striated myocytes. Yields of human myocytes were lower (20-40%). Myocytes were maintained at room temperature until use. To determine whether exogenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC; a glutathione precursor) or glutathione modulated ICa, preparations were divided following isolation, with half stored in an incubation buffer containing 10 mm NAC or glutathione, whereas the remaining cells were held in an incubation buffer without additional antioxidant. The composition of this buffer was as follows: 118 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm taurine, 4 mm dextrose, 5 mm pyruvate, 2 mm mannitol, pH 7.4. Cells were incubated for a minimum of 1 h in NAC before recordings were initiated and for a minimum of 3 h in glutathione. Only myocytes with clear striations and sharp margins were used for the electrophysiological studies, and all measurements were made within 8 h of cell isolation. Patch Clamp Experiments—Conventional whole cell patch clamp techniques were used. Data acquisition was performed with pClamp software (version 6.05+; Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and an Axopatch (1C or 200A) patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments). The pipette solution contained 125 mm CsCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm MgATP, 3.6 mm creatine phosphate, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The bath solution (35 °C) contained 157 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. ICa recordings began 3 min after patch rupture. Isoproterenol (1 μmol/liter) was used to test the response of ICa to maximal β-adrenergic receptor stimulation (steady state, ∼4 min exposure). Electrophysiologic experiments were performed under continuous flow conditions at 35 ± 0.5 °C. Canine Glutathione Depletion—l-Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO; Sigma) was dissolved in 30 ml of 0.9% NaCl immediately prior to intravenous administration. Young adult beagle hounds of either sex (5-12 kg) were randomly assigned to either active treatment (0.1 mmol/kg BSO, n = 10) or control dosing (30 ml of 0.9% NaCl injection, n = 10) twice daily for 2 days. On the morning of day 3, in vivo measurements were obtained prior to euthanasia and removal of the heart. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Ohio State University. In Vivo Physiologic Measurements—Dogs were lightly sedated for all conscious procedures (butorphanol, 0.1 mg/kg intramuscularly). Two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography was performed at base line and daily thereafter (SSD 1400 (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan) with a 5 MHz transducer). Systolic blood pressure was measured in triplicate using an automated blood pressure device (Vet/BP model 6000; Sensor Devices Inc., Waukesha, WI). Electrocardiograms were recorded using a Biopac MP 100 (Biopac Systems, Santa Barbara, CA); lead I was used for P wave measurements. Electrocardiograms were digitized and stored for off-line analysis (acqKnowledge version 3.5, Biopac Systems, Santa Barbara, CA). After induction of anesthesia with isoflorane, a bipolar electrode was advanced to the right atrium. Atrial effective refractory periods (ERPs) were determined at cycle lengths of 300, 250, and 200 ms, using a train of eight pacing stimuli at twice the diastolic pacing threshold, followed by an increasingly premature extrastimulus (5-ms decrement) delivered by a programmable stimulator (Medtronic model 5325; Medtronic, Inc.). Inducibility of atrial arrhythmias was determined using a right atrial burst pacing protocol (10 Hz stimulation for 10 s). Inducibility was evaluated in triplicate at 5-min intervals. In Vitro Physiology Studies: Contractility—In a separate set of experiments, dogs were randomized to treatment with BSO or vehicle control as above (n = 3 per group). Dissection and experimental procedures for trabeculae were as previously described (27Janssen P.M. Lehnart S.E. Prestle J. Hasenfuss G. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1419-1427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, using a stereomicroscope, ultrathin trabeculae were dissected from the right atria (n = 20 trabeculae) in a Krebs-Henseleit solution, containing 120 mmol/liter NaCl, 5.0 mmol/liter KCl, 2.0 mmol/liter MgSO4, 1.2 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 20 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 0.25 mmol/liter CaCl2, and 20 mmol/liter 2,3-butanedione monoxime in continuous equilibrium with 95% O2, 5%CO2. Only very small muscles (averages 237 ± 24 μm wide, 162 ± 17 μm thick, and 2.97 ± 0.32 mm long) were used. Muscles were mounted between a force transducer and a length displacement device, in the same solution (with omission of 2,3-butanedione monoxime and CaCl2 increased to 1.5 mmol/liter). At 37 °C, stimulation at 1 Hz (20% above threshold) was initiated. After equilibration at optimal length, a force-frequency protocol was performed. Trabeculae were stimulated at frequencies of 1-5 Hz, and data were collected at steady state for each frequency. Next, the response to isoproterenol (1 nmol/liter to 1 μmol/liter) was assessed. Data were collected and analyzed with custom programs written in Labview. Glutathione Assay—Atrial glutathione levels were measured using colorimetric assays (Oxis Research and Northwest Life Sciences). Intra-assay coefficient of variation was estimated as 0.6%, and interassay coefficient of variation was estimated as 3%. Frozen (-80 °C) tissue specimens, 20-60 mg each, were homogenized in vendor-recommended buffers for measurement of tissue glutathione. S-Nitrosylation Measurement—The biotin switch technique (28Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : L1Google Scholar) was used to assess the extent of nitrosylation of human LAA tissue or HEK cell lysates from cells stably overexpressing the α1C subunit of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel (29Hudasek K. Brown S.T. Fearon I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This technique labels nitrosylated cysteines with biotin, so that this posttranslational modification can be visualized. Briefly, left atrial appendage tissue or cells were homogenized in HEN buffer (250 mm Hepes-NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm neocuproine). Free thiol groups were blocked with 20 mm methyl methane-thiosulfonate in HEN buffer with 1% SDS for 20 min at 50 °C. Free methyl methane-thiosulfonate was removed by acetone precipitation at -20 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the resulting pellet was resuspended in HEN buffer with 1% SDS. SNO groups were reduced with sodium ascorbate (1 mm), and free thiols were labeled with N-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)-propionamide (4 mm; Pierce) for 1 h at 25 °C. All steps up to this point were performed with minimal light at 4 °C to prevent the loss of endogenous S-nitrosylation. Following biotin labeling, a 20-μl aliquot was removed from each sample and added to 2× sample buffer. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE under nondenaturing conditions, and Western blot analysis was performed using a mouse anti-biotin antibody (Sigma) to label biotinylated, and thus nitrosylated, residues. The remainder of some samples was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody to the α1C subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and immunoprecipitated protein was analyzed by Western blot analysis using an antibiotin antibody to determine the level of nitrosylation of the α1C subunit. Generation of Antibodies—Antibodies to the cardiac α1C subunit (Fig. 6) were raised against synthetic peptides as described for the 2-3 loop antibody in Ref. 5Schotten U. Haase H. Frechen D. Greiser M. Stellbrink C. Vazquez-Jimenez J.F. Morano I. Allessie M.A. Hanrath P. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 437-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar. Further antigenic epitopes comprised the long N-terminal (KGTLVHEAQLN) and the α/β interaction domain in the 1-2 loop (KQQLEEDLKGYLKG) of the cardiac α1C (Swiss-Prot accession number P15381). The antibodies were affinity-purified on respective peptide antigen columns. Reagents—Reagents, all analytical grade or higher, were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise noted. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using either Student's t test or analysis of variance, as appropriate. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. Glutathione Content Is Decreased in LAA Tissues from AF Patients and BSO-treated Dogs—Total glutathione content was evaluated in left atrial tissues from cardiac surgery patients with no history of AF and compared with that of persistent AF patients or patients with a history of paroxysmal AF but in normal sinus rhythm at the time of surgery (Table 1). Fig. 1A shows that relative to control patients with no history of AF, left atrial glutathione content was 65% lower in patients with persistent AF. Tissue from patients with a history of paroxysmal AF but in sinus rhythm at the time of surgery had glutathione levels 45% lower than controls, a value intermediate between that of controls and those in AF at surgery. Analysis of variance revealed that differences between groups were highly significant (p < 0.001). Fig. 1B shows the left atrial glutathione content in dogs treated for 48 h with or without BSO. Glutathione levels were lower (23.7%, p < 0.02) in atrial tissues from dogs treated for 48 h with BSO than in control animals (0.74 ± 0.06 versus 0.97 ± 0.06 μmol/g) (Fig. 1B). Influence of NAC on Human Atrial Calcium Currents (ICa)—ICa was recorded from left atrial myocytes isolated from AF patients in AF at the time of surgery (Fig. 2). As described under “Materials and Methods,” half of the myocytes from each preparation were stored in a buffer supplemented with 10 mmol/liter NAC, a glutathione precursor. Recordings were obtained under base line conditions and following exposure to isoproterenol (4-min exposure, 1 μm) (Fig. 2, A-D). NAC exposure significantly increased human atrial ICa in myocytes from AF patients. Base line ICa was ∼70% higher in the myocytes preincubated with NAC relative to those not similarly incubated with NAC (-11.85 ± 1.4 pA/pF versus -6.97 ± 0.9 pA/pF, p < 0.002). Current-voltage relations for the responses to NAC incubation and to isoproterenol stimulation are summarized in Fig. 2E. Although both isoproterenol and NAC increased ICa, the leftward shift in the current-voltage relations typically observed following adrenergic stimulation were not present following NAC exposure alone. Peak ICa densities for each group before and after isoproterenol stimulation are summarized and compared in Fig. 2F. Perhaps because of the up-regulation of basal ICa, the relative response of NAC-treated myocytes to isoproterenol was attenuated relative to that of myocytes not treated with NAC (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that NAC and isoproterenol have discrete effects on the calcium channel. Interestingly, in myocytes from two patients with no history of AF, incubation with 10 mm NAC had no significant effect on peak ICa (-9.0 ± 2.6 pA/pF (n = 3) in control bath, versus -11.1 ± 0.7 pA/pF (n = 3) in NAC, p = 0.68). Effects of BSO on Canine Atrial Function, Muscle Contractility, and Calcium Currents—To more systematically evaluate the functional impact of glutathione depletion on atrial contractility and calcium currents, 10 dogs were treated with BSO (a γ-glutamyl synthetase inhibitor) for 48 h prior to echocardiographic examination of cardiac function and ex vivo electrophysiologic and contractile characterization and compared with the same number of control (untreated) animals. In Vivo Effects of BSO—As summarized in Table 2, there were no base line differences between groups with respect to resting heart rate, P wave duration, left atrial diameter, left atrial contractility, left ventricular fractional shortening, or peak A wave velocity. The only significant difference between groups prior to initiation of treatment was a slightly higher systolic blood pressure in the BSO-treated dogs. There was no significant difference in systolic blood pressure or heart rate between groups after 48 h of treatment. In addition, atrial conduction (assessed by P wave duration) was unchanged from base line in either treatment group. Echocardiography revealed no significant changes in left ventricular internal diameter-diastole, left ventricular internal diameter-systole, left ventricular fractional shortening, peak E wave velocity, or left atrial diameters or areas in either group. However, peak A wave velocity, a measure of atrial function, was reduced an average of 24.3% in the BSO-treated dogs from 39.6 ± 3.2 to 28.3 ± 2.18 m/s (Fig. 3A, paired t test, p < 0.007).TABLE 2Canine base line (pretreatment) in vivo cardiovascular function (means ± S.E.)GroupSBPHRP wave durationLV FSPeak A wave velocitymm Hgbpmms%m/sControl (n = 10)127 ± 392 ± 2140.3 ± 1.442.2 ± 1.840.3 ± 2.3BSO, 0.2 mmol/kg/day (n = 10)140 ± 4ap = 0.025.111 ± 2039.9 ± 1.441.5 ± 1.339.7 ± 3.2a p = 0.025. Open table in a new tab Atrial ERPs were assessed at cycle lengths of 300, 250, and 200 ms prior to euthanasia. Analysis of variance from studies at all rates revealed that BSO treatment significantly shortened ERPs compared with the control group (p < 0.001). Abbreviation of the ERP by BSO treatment was greatest at the highest stimulation rates (Fig. 3B). There was no difference in either inducibility or duration of atrial arrhythmias between the two groups, with 2 of 10 control and 2 of 10 BSO-treated dogs having brief (<5 s) inducible atrial fibrillation.

Thermodynamic measurements on this system showed that the relevant control parameter is the total density of the 3He film. The 3He bilayer system can be driven toward a quantum critical point at which the effective mass appears to diverge, interband coupling vanishes, and a local-moment state appears.

A series of α-substituted indomethacin ethanolamides, which exist as R/S-enantiomeric pairs, provides a means to study the impact of stereochemistry on COX inhibition. Comparative studies revealed that the R- and S-enantiomers of the α-substituted analogs inhibit COX-2 with almost equal efficacy, whereas COX-1 is selectively inhibited by the S-enantiomers. Mutagenesis studies have not been able to identify residues that manifest the enantioselectivity in COX-1.

Cyclooxygenase (COX 4The abbreviations used are: COXcyclooxygenasePGprostaglandinPOXperoxidaseNSAIDsnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsβ-OGn-octyl-β-glucopyranosideoCOXovine COX.4The abbreviations used are: COXcyclooxygenasePGprostaglandinPOXperoxidaseNSAIDsnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsβ-OGn-octyl-β-glucopyranosideoCOXovine COX.; also known as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase) is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2, the immediate precursor to prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin. The conversion of arachidonic acid into PGH2 proceeds through two separate reactions in which two molecules of O2 are incorporated into arachidonic acid bound in the COX site to form PGG2, which then diffuses to the peroxidase site (POX) to undergo a two-electron reduction to form the final product PGH2. Two isoforms of COX exist and are referred to as COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many tissues to produce the amounts of prostaglandins needed for regulating normal “housekeeping” functions such as renal water retention, gastric acid secretion, parturition, and hemostasis. In contrast, various inflammatory stimuli associated with the immune response rapidly induce the expression of COX-2 and the associated prostaglandins, which result in pain, fever, and inflammation (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar).Nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide therapeutic benefit through the direct inhibition of the COX enzymes; however, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties of NSAIDs are mainly a result of inhibition of COX-2. Although nonselective inhibition of COX-1 by aspirin can be beneficial in reducing the risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease, the use of aspirin and other NSAIDs has been associated with undesirable gastrointestinal side effects such as stomach ulcers and intestinal bleeding (2DeWitt D.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 625-631PubMed Google Scholar, 3Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The predominant role of COX-2 in pain and inflammation spawned the development of selective inhibitors, which target only the COX-2 isoform to achieve analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties with minimal associated gastrointestinal toxicity. However, cardiovascular side effects have recently been documented for at least certain COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. rofecoxib, valdecoxib, and celecoxib).Structural and functional studies comparing COX-1 and COX-2 have identified some general structural features of NSAIDs binding to the COX active site, in addition to highlighting subtle biochemical differences between the isoforms that have been exploited in the development of COX-2-selective inhibitors (4Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Stegeman R.A. Pak J.Y. Gildehaus D. Miyashiro J.M. Penning T.D. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. Stallings W.C.

The entrance to the COX active site is made up in part by a bundle of four amphipathic helices, which leads to a constriction comprised of residues Arg-120, 5The numbering of residues in ovine COX-1 is based on numbering the N-terminal methionine of the signal peptide as residue number 1.5The numbering of residues in ovine COX-1 is based on numbering the N-terminal methionine of the signal peptide as residue number 1., Tyr-355, and Glu-524. The COX active site then opens into a long hydrophobic channel that extends deep into the core of the catalytic domain of the protein. Sitting above the constriction and aside the main hydrophobic channel is a smaller amphipathic region referred to as the “side pocket.” A major difference in the active site of the isoforms arises mainly as a result of a valine substitution in COX-2 for isoleucine in COX-1 at position 523. This small change provides additional space to allow better access to the side pocket of COX-2. The active site of COX-2 can therefore accommodate the extra bulk of the sulfonamoylphenyl or methylsulfonylphenyl moieties of COX-2-selective inhibitors, particularly those of the diarylheterocycles (celecoxib and rofecoxib) by placing them in the side pocket.The potential for interaction between moieties of the drug and residues within the side pocket of COX-2 also seems to be partly responsible for time-dependent inhibition by COX-2-selective NSAIDs. Although diarylheterocycles competitively inhibit COX-2 better than COX-1, their lack of time-dependent inhibition behavior toward COX-1 further enhances their selectivity toward COX-2 (7Gierse J.K. Koboldt C.M. Walker M.C. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 8Walker M.C. Kurumbail R.G. Kiefer J.R. Moreland K.T. Koboldt C.M. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Gierse J.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The structural explanation for the lack of time-dependent inhibition toward COX-1 is the extra methylene group of isoleucine at position 523, which restricts access of COX-2 inhibitors to the side pocket in COX-1.COX-2-selective inhibitors also lack a free carboxylate group, which may contribute to their low affinity toward COX-1. Several crystal structures of COX-1 and COX-2 have shown that NSAIDs with a free carboxylate moiety form an ionic interaction with Arg-120 at the mouth of the COX active site (4Kurumbail R.G.

This interaction between the carboxylate of acidic NSAIDs and Arg-120 appears to be essential for substrate binding to COX-1, as site-directed mutagenesis studies of COX-1 have demonstrated that the binding of arachidonic acid and acidic NSAIDs was greatly perturbed when Arg-120 is mutated to smaller or uncharged residues (11Bhattacharyya D.K. Lecomte M. Rieke C.J. Garavito M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2179-2184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In contrast, the equivalent mutations of Arg-120 seemed to suggest that electrostatic interactions with this residue in COX-2 are less critical for catalysis and NSAID inhibition (12Greig G.M.

Crews B.C. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett A.B. Kozak K.R. Remmel R.P. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The majority of these indomethacin derivatives was shown to be potent and selective for COX-2; however, an exception was observed with the α-substituted indomethacin ethanolamide series of derivatives (15Kozak K.R. Prusakiewicz J.J. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 1315-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The (R/S)-α-substituted indomethacin ethanolamides both demonstrated potent inhibition of COX-2; however, the S-α-substituted indomethacin ethanolamides inhibited COX-1 as effectively as COX-2. Interestingly, the chiral preference observed with COX-1 inhibition was consistently observed with S-enantiomers across a wide range of α-substitutions (Table 1). Mutagenic studies in COX-2 were unable to identify residues around the COX active site that contributed to the observed chiral selectivity. To understand the structural basis of this chiral discrimination in COX-1, we determined the crystal structures of ovine COX-1 complexed with the α-ethyl-substituted enantiomeric pair of these indomethacin ethanolamides. In addition, the kinetic basis of selectivity was examined using pre-steady state measurements. These structures not only provide intriguing insight into the structural basis for the stereoselective binding of the S-α-substituted indomethacin ethanolamides to COX-1, but, in conjunction with kinetic analysis provide an illustration of how COX-1 can bind a noncarboxylate containing inhibitor with high affinity.TABLE 1Comparative inhibition of native COX-1 and COX-2 by various α-substituted indomethacin ethanolamides Open table in a new tab EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Detergents C10E6 used for solubilization and n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (β-OG) used for purification and crystallization were purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH).

After an initial round of simulated annealing, several sugar moieties, detergent molecules, and the inhibitors were fitted to density in several iterative cycles of positional refinement, group B-factor refinement, and manual model building. To further complete the model, water molecules were added at positions in the Fo - Fc difference electron density maps where the peak heights were greater than 2.5σ and within 2.4 -3.6 Å of a hydrogen bond partner. At final round of refinement, the R and Rfree converged 24.5 and 29.2%.Structure Determination and Refinement of COX-1·9 Complex—The COX-1·9 was refined with REFMAC version 5.0 in the CCP4 program suite (19Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallographica Sect.

REFMAC refinement started with the protein portion of using native COX-1 structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1DIY). The COX-1·9 structure was initially put through TLS refinement (20Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Each round of refinement included 10 cycles of TLS, followed by 20 cycles of restrained refinement (which included positional refinement followed by B-factor refinement). A single TLS group consisting of protein residues 33-580 was used for the TLS portion of refinement. Iterative cycles of TLS/restrained refinement were followed by cycles of map calculation and model building. In successive rounds of refinement, the heme group, six saccharide moieties, a glucopyranoside head group from β-OG, and ∼20 water molecules (using the same criteria used for oCOX-1·8 complex) were added to the model. At the final round of refinement, the R and Rfree converged at 24.1 and 29.2%.Modeling of Compound 8 Using Simulated Annealing—Five rounds of simulated annealing utilizing molecular dynamics in CNS version 1.1 (18Brunger A.T.

Reconstituted enzyme was preincubated at 37 °C with either 100 μm 8 or 1.75 μm 9 for various lengths of time. Following preincubation, 50 μm [14C]arachidonic acid was added, and the incubation was allowed to proceed for 30 s at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated and analyzed for substrate consumption by thin layer chromatography as described previously (14Kalgutkar A.S. Crews B.C. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett A.B. Kozak K.R. Remmel R.P.

Cyclooxygenase reactions were initiated by the addition of 50 μm [14C]arachidonic acid. Aliquots were removed at specific time points (30 s to 5 min) and transferred to tubes containing termination solution.

Measurements were acquired on an Applied Photophysics Ltd. model SX17MV (United Kingdom) stopped-flow fluorometer with a 1-cm path length cell. Quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence was monitored following excitation at 280 nm. An average of four to eight shots was taken for each inhibitor concentration, and vehicle control was subtracted to correct for nonspecific photobleaching. Resulting traces were fit to single exponential decay using ProK software (Applied Photophysics Ltd.) to extract amplitudes and observed rate constants (kobs). For each inhibitor, kobs was plotted against concentration of inhibitor, and the data fit by nonlinear regression.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBinding of 8 Versus 9 in the COX Site—Compounds 8 and 9 were modeled into the electron density maps with the ethanolamide moiety in the lower energy trans-amide bond configuration. The observed electron density for both 8 and 9 was not clear enough at 2.8 Å resolution to determine whether the amide bond adopted either a cis or trans configuration with a high degree of certainty. The trans conformer for the ethanolamide moiety is most likely to be the stable conformer in solution (32Moth C.W. Prusakiewicz J.J. Marnett L.J. Lybrand T.P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 3613-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, the transition between the trans and cis conformers has to overcome a high activation energy barrier. Nonetheless, the cis-amide conformer could not be unequivocally ruled out. Thus, for completeness, the cis-amide bond configuration for both 8 and 9 was also examined to determine whether it impacted the interactions of the ligands within the COX active site.The electron density maps obtained for the COX-1·8 structure shows that the R-stereoisomer binds in an orientation that closely resembles the binding mode of the parent compound indomethacin (4Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Stegeman R.A. Pak J.Y. Gildehaus D. Miyashiro J.M. Penning T.D. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. Stallings W.C.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7330-7340Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); the chlorobenzoyl group is oriented up to the apex of the channel by Tyr-385, the methoxy group of the indole ring points toward the side pocket, and the ethanolamide group is positioned toward the mouth of the channel near Arg-120 and Tyr-355 (Fig. 1, A and B). The hydroxyl group of the ethanolamide moiety of 8 makes a hydrogen bond with the guanidinium group of Arg-120 and with carboxylate of Glu-524 (Fig. 1B). The trans conformer of 8 fits the electron density equally well before and after refinement. The final refined model generated no positive or negative density peaks observed around the inhibitor in the Fo - Fc difference electron density maps.The interactions observed between residues of the COX site and ethanolamide moiety in the cis conformer were also essentially identical to the interactions generated with the trans conformer. However, some minor, but interesting differences were observed. With the amide bond in the trans configuration, the hydroxyl of the ethanolamide made an additional interaction with the carboxylate of Glu-524. In addition, the position of Arg-120 differed noticeably after refinement with the trans conformer of 8. Given no evidence to the contrary, 8 most likely binds to the COX-1 active site as the trans conformer, a conclusion that is consistent with the modeling study by Moth et al. (32Moth C.W. Prusakiewicz J.J. Marnett L.J. Lybrand T.P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 3613-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).After refinement of the COX-1·9 structure, the observed electron density for 9, the S-stereoisomer, revealed an elongated stretch of electron density that extends into the side pocket region of the COX active site (a region defined by residues Gln-192, His-90, Leu-517, Phe-518, and Ile-523 (Fig. 2A). The extra electron density within the side pocket is not observed in the structure of the COX-1·8 complex and suggests a different and contrasting mode of binding for the S-stereoisomer. After extensive model building trials, it is clear that 9 binds within the COX-1 active site with the chlorobenzoyl moiety oriented toward the mouth, the methoxy group pointed toward the top of the channel by Tyr-385, and the ethanolamide group positioned in the side pocket region (Fig. 2, A and B).FIGURE 2Compound 9 bound in the COX active site of COX-1. A, stereo view of 9 fitted into simulated annealing omit map difference density (blue) contoured at 3σ witha3Å boundary around the ligand. Carbon atoms of 9 are colored green with heteroatoms colored the same as in 1. B, chlorobenzoyl group of 9 is oriented toward the mouth of the active site; the methoxy group of indole ring is oriented up into the top of the channel, and the ethanolamide group with the (S)-ethyl substitution lies within the side pocket region of the channel. Yellow dashed lines represent various interactions (hydrophobic and hydrophilic) between ligand and protein. The hydroxyl group of the ethanolamide is oriented near the hydrophilic region (cyan) of the side pocket making hydrogen bonds with residues Gln-192 and His-90 whereas the S-ethyl group is oriented into the more hydrophobic region (pink) of the side pocket making van der Waals interactions with Ile-523, Phe-518, and Ile-517. For clarity, an additional polar interaction between Arg-120 and the carbonyl of the chlorobenzoyl moiety is not shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This conclusion is supported by an inspection of the Fo - Fc difference electron density after the final rounds of refinement. With the final refined model, no significant positive or negative electron density peaks were observed around compound 9, including around the region of the ethanolamide group. Some poorly defined negative difference density was observed near the chlorobenzoyl moiety. However, this peak was not well defined, was not centered on any particular atom, and was not particularly intense (<3σ). This feature is most likely an artifact arising from the medium resolution of data or some disorder of the inhibitor binding mode.In this altered mode of binding, the ethanolamide group of 9 makes many interactions with hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues in the side pocket with the hydroxyl group making hydrogen bonds with His-90 and Gln-192. There are also several hydrophobic interactions involving Phe-518 and Ile-523 (Fig. 2B). An additional hydrophilic interaction is observed between the guanidinium group of Arg-120 and the carbonyl group of the chlorobenzoyl moiety positioned at the mouth of the active site. The trans configuration of the amide bond fits the electron density well, before and after refinement. Although the interactions observed between the ethanolamide moiety and the side pocket of COX site were maintained with either the cis or trans configuration, the trans configuration allows the formation of an additional interaction between the amide nitrogen of 9 and the carbonyl oxygen from the backbone of residue Leu-352. The observation supports the hypothesis that the trans conformer is the more prevalent conformer (Fig. 2B), when 9 binds to COX-1.Evaluation of the Structural Basis for Stereoselectivity—The inhibitor complexes suggest that the distinctly different binding modes for 8 and 9 are the result of the S-stereoisomer making more favorable binding interactions within the side pocket compared with th"

The P-N-P bond angle (127.2 degrees) and P-N bond distance (1.68 angstroms) are remarkably similar to newly refined values for the P-O-P bond angle (128.6 degrees) and the bridging P-O bond distance (1.63 angstroms) of sodium pyrophosphate.

https://openalex.org/W2065884839,"We investigated how heterodimeric capping proteins bind to and dissociate from the barbed ends of actin filaments by observing single muscle actin filaments by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The barbed end rate constants for mouse capping protein (CP) association of 2.6 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and dissociation of 0.0003 s<sup>-1</sup> agree with published values measured in bulk assays. The polyphosphoinositides (PPIs), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>), PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, prevent CP from binding to barbed ends, but three different assays showed that none of these lipids dissociate CP from filaments at concentrations that block CP binding to barbed ends. The affinity of fission yeast CP for barbed ends is a thousandfold less than mouse CP, because of a slower association rate constant (1.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and a faster dissociation rate constant (0.004 s<sup>-1</sup>). PPIs do not inhibit binding of fission yeast CP to filament ends. Comparison of homology models revealed that fission yeast CP lacks a large patch of basic residues along the actin-binding surface on mouse CP. PPIs binding to this site might interfere sterically with capping, but this site would be inaccessible when CP is bound to the end of a filament."

In addition, their physiological substrate(s) are unknown, and the intrinsic phosphatase activity of PRLs toward artificial chromogenic substrates is extremely low (21Kozlov G. Cheng J. Ziomek E.

Furthermore, PRLs are among the smallest PTPs (∼170 residues), consisting of a single catalytic domain with no auxiliary docking/regulatory domains other than the prenylation site at the C terminus (Fig. 1).

We solved a number of crystal structures of native PRL1 as well as the catalytically inactive mutant PRL1/C104S in complex with sulfate (22Sun J.-P. Wang W.-Q. Yang H. Liu S. Liang F. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12009-12021Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These structures provided a molecular explanation for the extremely low phosphatase activity and offered a potential mechanism for PRL activation. Surprisingly, the structures revealed that PRL1 exists as a trimer in the crystalline state. Trimerization creates a large, bipartite membrane-binding surface in which the exposed C-terminal basic residues could cooperate with the adjacent prenylated group to anchor PRL1 on the acidic inner membrane. This study was designed to determine the functional significance of these structural observations. We present evidence herein that the phosphatase activity, trimerization, and the C-terminal polybasic region are all required for the PRL1-mediated cell growth and migration. Moreover, we show that the C-terminal polybasic region is responsible for binding distinct phosphoinositides. Materials—p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was purchased from Fluka. Zeocin was purchased from Invitrogen. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Invitrogen. Anti-HA antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade available commercially. Constructs and Cell Lines—For PRL1 expression in mammalian cells, the full-length PRL1 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA4 vector with an HA tag on the N terminus. PRL1 mutants were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For small hairpin RNA interference, a specific 21-oligonucleotide sequence (GTTTAAGGTCGCATTGGTTGG) targeting the PRL1 mRNA region (571-591) was subcloned into the pSilencer 1.0-U6 construct (Ambion). Establishment of Stable Cell Lines—HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Constructs containing PRL1 or its mutants were transfected into HEK293 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The day after transfection, Zeocin was added to the culture dishes (500 μg/ml), and drug-resistant cells were allowed to grow for 14 days. Individual Zeocin stable colonies were picked and tested for PRL1 expression level. Clones with PRL1 mRNA at about 1-2-fold over the endogenous level were selected. RT-PCR—Total RNAs were isolated from cultured HEK293 cells by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration and quality were assessed spectrophotometrically at wavelengths 260 and 280 nm. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with Super-Script one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of RNA (200 ng) were used as templates in each reaction. The primers used for PRL1 amplification were 5′-CCAGCTCCTGTGGAAGTCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCATCATCAAAAGGCCAATC-3′ (reverse). As a control, the primers used for 18 S rRNA amplification were 5′-CAGCGAAAGCATTTGCCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGGTGCCCTTCCGTCAATTC-3′ (reverse). The primers for PRL2 were 5′-AGCCAGGTTGCTGTGTTGCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACAGCAATGCCCATTGGTA-3′ (reverse). The primers for PRL-3 were 5′-CTTCCTCATCACCCACAACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCTTGTGCGTGTGTGTGGGTC-3′. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel. Immunoblotting—0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Tween 20, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm iodoacetic acid, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) were added to each 10-cm dish once it reached 80% confluency. Cells were scraped with a rubber policeman and lysed on ice for 30 min. During this period, 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to reduce the iodoacetic acid. The cell lysate was then pre-cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 relative centrifugation force for 15 min. Protein concentration of the lysate was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with a series dilution. The Western blotting was done according to standard procedures. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells growing on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked in 10% normal goat serum/PBS for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary anti-HA antibody in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. Cells were then washed with PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and goat anti-mouse IgG-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate in PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 with 2% goat serum for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted with anti-fade mounting solution. Confocal microscope images were obtained with a Zeiss imaging system. MTT Assay—PRL1 stable cell lines were seeded in a 96-multiwell plate (1000 cells/well) containing DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell proliferation was then determined over a 120-h period by means of the MTT assay (24Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar), using a multiwell spectrophotometer (Victor 2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A standard curve of HEK293 cells was plotted to correlate the number of living cells with the absorbance values. Cell Motility Assay—Cell migration was measured as described (16Zeng Q. Dong J.M. Guo K. Li J. Tan H.X. Koh V. Pallen C.J. Manser E. Hong W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The assay was performed with Transwells (6.5 mm diameter; 8 μm pore size poly-carbonate membrane) obtained from Corning Glass. Cells (3.75 × 105) in 1.5 ml of serum-free medium were placed in the upper chamber, whereas the lower chamber was loaded with 2.6 ml of medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h, the total numbers of cells that migrated into the lower chamber was counted with a hemocytometer. Subcellular Fractionation—The subcellular fraction experiment was conducted as described previously (22Sun J.-P. Wang W.-Q. Yang H. Liu S. Liang F. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12009-12021Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Stable clones expressing HA-tagged PRL1 constructs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were washed and scraped down in 1 ml of ice-cold Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture, 250 mm sucrose). Then the cells were passed through a 27-gauge needle 20 times. The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to pellet the nuclei and intact cells, and the supernatant was again centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain the S100 soluble fraction and the P100 membrane fraction. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Kinetic Constants for the PRL1-catalyzed Reaction—Initial rate measurements for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP were conducted as described previously (25Wang W.-Q. Bembenek J. Gee K.R. Yu H. Charbonneau H. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30459-30468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All assays were carried out at 25 °C in a pH 7.0 buffer of 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate, containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA, with an ionic strength of 0.15 m, adjusted by addition of NaCl. For the pNPP reaction, assay mixtures of 200 μl in total volume were set up in a 96-well polystyrene plate from Fisher. A substrate concentration range from 0.2 to 5 Km was used to determine the kcat and Km values. Reactions were started by the addition of an appropriate amount of PRL1. The reaction mixtures were quenched with 50 μl of 5 m sodium hydroxide, and the absorbance at 405 nm was read using a plate reader. The steady-state kinetic parameters were determined from a direct fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the non-linear regression program KINETASYST (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA). Lipid-Membrane Overlay Assays—PIP strips were purchased from Echelon Biosciences. The strips were incubated with 5 μg/ml purified His or GST-tagged PRL1 and mutants in Buffer A containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% TBST, and 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. After extensive washing with Buffer A, PRLs bound to the membrane strips were probed with appropriate anti-His or anti-GST antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Detection was made by enhanced chemiluminescence reactions followed by exposure to x-ray film. The control experiments were performed without addition of any enzymes or GST tag only under the same conditions. Statistical Analyses—Cell proliferation was measured eight times, and cell migration measurements were repeated three times. The data were presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was evaluated with Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PRL1 Promotes HEK293 Cell Growth and Migration—We chose the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line, an epithelium-derived cell line, as a model system to investigate the functional significance of unique structural features observed in previous x-ray crystallographic studies. We first determined the effect of PRL1 down-regulation by transfecting HEK293 cells with a mammalian expression vector pU6 (Biomyx, San Diego) containing a gene-specific insert of a 21-nucleotide sequence targeting the PRL1 mRNA region 571-591. Several clones stably expressing the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for PRL1 were selected. As shown in Fig. 2, PRL1 mRNA levels in the shRNA-expressing cells were significantly decreased (70-80%) compared with the pU6 vector control. As a control for PRL1 knockdown specificity, we also quantified the mRNA levels of PRL2 and PRL3. The results showed that suppression of PRL1 expression by shRNA did not affect the mRNA levels of PRL2 and PRL3 (Fig. 2). We then measured the effect of PRL1 suppression on cell growth by either direct cell counting or a well established colorimetric microtiter assay using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide or MTT as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 2, the number of viable PRL1 shRNA cells at day 5 was 50% less than the vector control. In addition, the doubling time for the vector control cells was 24 h, similar to that of the parental nontransfected line. In contrast, the doubling times for the PRL1 shRNA clones 1 and 2 were 28 and 29 h, respectively. We also investigated whether a decrease in PRL1 level would have an effect on cell motility. Using a standard Transwell assay to measure cell migration toward serum, we found that the relative migration rates for the PRL1 knockdown cells were ∼2-fold slower than that of the vector control cells (Fig. 2). Together, the data indicate that endogenous PRL1 silencing in HEK293 cells inhibited both cell growth and migration. To further establish the requirement of PRL1 for cell growth and migration, we also determined whether PRL1 overexpression could augment cell growth and migration. A number of stable HEK293 lines ectopically expressing the HA-tagged PRL1 were established. The PRL1 expression levels in the stable clones were ∼2-fold higher than that of the empty vector control (Fig. 3). As expected, a rise in PRL1 level increased the cell proliferation by 70%, whereas elevated expression of PRL1 led to an ∼3-fold increase in cell motility (Fig. 3). Taken together, the results from both shRNA knockdown and ectopic expression experiments suggest that PRL1 is a positive regulator of both cell proliferation and migration. This conclusion is in complete agreement with previous observations in other cell lines (including Chinese hamster ovary, SW480, D27, and DLD-1) (13Werner S.R. Lee P.A. DeCamp M.W. Crowell D.N.

This set the stage for evaluating the importance of the intrinsic phosphatase activity, trimerization and the C-terminal polybasic region for the PRL1-mediated processes using HEK293 cell growth and migration as functional readouts. The Intrinsic Phosphatase Activity of PRL1 Is Obligatory for Function—Although the importance of PRLs in cell growth and migration is well established, there is limited understanding of the structure and function relationship for these unique PTPs. Such knowledge can help develop novel approaches to manipulate the pathways regulated by these enzymes to gain further insight into their roles in signaling and diseases. Unfortunately, the physiological substrates for PRL1 have not been identified. In addition, the activity of PRLs toward the chromogenic substrate pNPP is orders of magnitude lower than those of typical PTPs (21Kozlov G. Cheng J. Ziomek E. Banville D. Gehring K. Ekiel I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 11882-11889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Sun J.-P. Wang W.-Q. Yang H. Liu S. Liang F. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12009-12021Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Like other members of the PTP superfamily, the PTP signature motif in PRL1 (103HCVAGLGR110) forms a phosphate-binding loop at the base of the active site pocket (22Sun J.-P. Wang W.-Q. Yang H. Liu S. Liang F. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12009-12021Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Jeong D.G. Kim S.J. Kim J.H. Son J.H. Park M.R. Lim S.M. Yoon T.S. Ryu S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the PRL active site motif lacks a conserved hydroxyl group (Ala instead of Ser/Thr at position 111), which is important for the hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate (28Zhang Z.-Y. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 171-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PRL1 is also missing an H-bond (a Val at position 113 instead of a Thr) important for the stabilization of the phosphate-binding loop. Substitution of Ala-111 or Val-113 by either Ser or Thr can substantially increase the PRL1 catalytic activity (22Sun J.-P. Wang W.-Q. Yang H. Liu S. Liang F. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12009-12021Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear whether the intrinsic phosphatase activity is required for PRL function. Previous studies have shown that substitution of the active site nucleophile Cys-104 with Ser or replacement of the general acid Asp-72 by Ala, which either abolishes or reduces the phosphatase activity, impairs the PRL-mediated cell growth and motility (16Zeng Q. Dong J.M. Guo K. Li J. Tan H.X. Koh V. Pallen C.J. Manser E. Hong W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar, 17Liang F. Liang J. Wang W.-Q. Sun J.-P. Udho E. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5413-5419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Fiordalisi J.J. Keller P.J. Cox A.D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, interpretation of these results is not always straightforward because of the fact that these mutants can also function as substrate-trapping agents (i.e. they still maintain strong affinity for substrate) that may or may not exert a dominant negative effect. To more definitively answer the question whether the intrinsic phosphatase activity is important for PRL function, we decided to evaluate the effect of mutagenizing the conserved active site Arg-110. Arg-110 makes a bidentate hydrogen bond with the phosphoryl group in the substrates and is important for both substrate binding and transition state stabilization in catalysis (28Zhang Z.-Y. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 171-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consequently, the PRL1/R110S mutant should behave as a true loss-of-function variant. Indeed, replacement of Arg-110 with a Ser not only increased the Km value by 11-fold but also decreased the kcat/Km value for the pNPP reaction by 280-fold (Table 1). In addition, we also studied two gain-of-function mutants, PRL1/A111S and PRL1/A111S/V113T, which exhibited kcat/Km values that were 2.4 and 24-fold higher than that of the wild-type PRL1 (Table 1). We established specific stable cell lines expressing the HA-tagged PRL1/R110S, PRL1/A111S, and PRL1/A111S/V113T mutant PRL1s. Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibodies showed that the protein levels for all mutants were similar to that of the wild-type PRL1 (Fig. 4). In addition, immunofluorescence experiments indicated that the mutants displayed similar subcellular localization as the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, introduction of PRL1/R110S into HEK293 cells had no influence on the endogenous PRL1-mediated cell proliferation and migration. This is consistent with the hypothesis that abrogation of Arg-110 side chain results in a loss-of-function phenotype. In accord with the increased catalytic activity for PRL1/A111S and PRL1/A111S/V113T, their expression further enhanced the PRL1-mediated cell growth and migration (Fig. 4). Collectively, these results support the notion that the intrinsic phosphatase activity is required for PRL1 function.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant PRL 1 phosphatases using pNPP as a substratePRL1kcatKmkcat/Kms−1mMM−1 s−1Wild type0.74 ± 0.03 × 10−40.56 ± 0.060.13 ± 0.015T13F0."

This study demonstrates that ligand-activated RXR homodimer facilitated G1 arrest by up-regulation of p21 in vitro and in vivo but failed to induce G1 arrest when p21 expression was blocked by p21 small interfering RNA. RXR ligand-dependent p21 up-regulation was transcriptionally controlled through the direct binding of RXR homodimers to two consecutive retinoid X response elements in the p21 promoter. Structural overlap of a retinoic acid response element with these retinoid X response elements led to a high affinity binding of retinoic acid receptor/RXR heterodimer to the retinoic acid response element, resulting in the prevention of RXR ligand-mediated p21 transactivation. These data show that p21 is a potential and novel molecular target for RXR ligand-mediated anti-cancer therapy and that the expression level of retinoic acid receptor and RXR in tumors may be crucial to induce p21-mediated cell growth arrest in RXR ligand therapy.

Retinoids are natural and synthetic vitamin A derivatives that regulate a multitude of biological processes in mammalian cells, including metabolism, development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and carcinogenesis (1Hansen L.A. Sigman C.C. Andreola F. Ross S.A. Kelloff G.J. De Luca L.M. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1271-1279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Carcinogen exposure causes squamous metaplasia of tracheal and other epithelia, and administration of vitamin A prevents tumor formation (2Lancillotti F. Darwiche N. Celli G. De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6144-6152PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoids are clinically used to target selected human cancers (3Evans T.R. Kaye S.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 27Sun S.Y. Lotan R. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 41: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The actions of retinoids are mediated by two distinct classes of retinoid receptors, retinoic acid receptors (RARα, -β, and -γ) 3The abbreviations used are: RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; 9cRA, 9-cis-retinoic acid; RXRE, retinoid X response element; RARE, retinoic acid response element; DR, direct repeat; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer cell line; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Ad, adenovirus; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; kb, kilobase(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; TTNPB, 4-(E-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-probenyl)benzoic acid; TRE, Tet response element. and retinoid X receptors (RXRα, β, and γ), which require all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid, respectively, for transcriptional activation. RXR is a combinatorial partner in the nuclear receptor family that forms homo- or heterodimers with a variety of hormone and orphan receptors, including RAR, vitamin D receptor, thyroid hormone receptor (TR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), and other receptors (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar). The dimeric receptors bind to specific DNA response element of target genes, and this DNA binding specificity is determined by the number of spacer nucleotides present between the two direct repeats of the canonical binding sequence AGGTCA (5Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For instance, RAR and RXR heterodimer binds to retinoic acid response element (RARE) that contains two or five spacers (DR2 or -5), and RXR homodimer binds to retinoid X response element (RXRE) in which the half-sites are separated by a single nucleotide (DR1) (5Mangelsdorf D.J. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Direct binding of ligands to the receptors is required for transcriptional activation, and in the absence of ligands, this activation is blocked by binding of specific repressors to the receptors (6Moehren U. Eckey M. Baniahmad A. Essays Biochem. 2004; 40: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Ligand binding triggers a release of the repressors from the complex and promotes interaction with co-activator complexes that forms a bridge between the nuclear receptors and the basic transcriptional machinery (6Moehren U. Eckey M. Baniahmad A. Essays Biochem. 2004; 40: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This tight regulatory control of the ligand-dependent transactivation of the nuclear receptor superfamily potentiates a multitude of therapeutic applications for anti-cancer treatments. However, clinical application of RAR ligand therapy has only shown limited efficacy possibly due to 1) multiple adverse effects caused by the requirement of large dosage to reach therapeutic efficacy and 2) frequent loss of, or reduced RAR expression in various cancer types. Conversely, RXR ligands (rexinoid) have shown promising chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activities with mild toxicity in several cancer types tested (7Cheng S.X. Kupper T. Arch. Dermatol. 2001; 137: 649-652PubMed Google Scholar), and RXR expression is rarely lost in human tumors (8Lawrence J.A. Merino M.J. Simpson J.F. Manrow R.E. Page D.L. Steeg P.S. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 1998; 7: 29-35PubMed Google Scholar). Administration of RXR ligand effectively suppressed tumor development in carcinogen-induced and transgenic mouse breast cancer models (9Wu K. Zhang Y. Xu X.C. Hill J. Celestino J. Kim H.T. Mohsin S.K. Hilsenbeck S.G. Lamph W.W. Bissonette R. Brown P.H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6376-6380PubMed Google Scholar). RXR ligand therapy in cutaneous T cell lymphoma clinical trials showed anti-tumor activities with moderate toxicity (7Cheng S.X. Kupper T. Arch. Dermatol. 2001; 137: 649-652PubMed Google Scholar), and non-small cell lung cancer patients in phase I and II clinical trials exhibited disease stabilization and improved survival with RXR ligand treatment (10Khuri F.R. Rigas J.R. Figlin R.A. Gralla R.J. Shin D.M. Munden R. Fox N. Huyghe M.R. Kean Y. Reich S.D. Hong W.K. J. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 19: 2626-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Despite these antitumor actions of RXR ligand, the molecular mechanisms underlying their efficacy are still poorly understood. Conditional RXR knock out studies suggested biological roles of RXR in adult tissues, further highlighting the relevance of RXR signaling pathways to cancer. Ablation of RXRα causes epidermal interfollicular hyperplasia, keratinocyte hyperproliferation, and aberrant terminal differentiation in skin (11Li M. Chiba H. Warot X. Messaddeq N. Gerard C.

Likewise, a reduction of RXRα expression in basal cells occurs in the early stage of prostate carcinogenesis (13Mao G.E. Reuter V.E. Cordon-Cardo C. Dalbagni G. Scher H.I. DeKernion J.B. Zhang Z.F.

Together, these findings suggest a role for RXR in tumor pathogenesis and the potential use of RXR ligand in cancer therapy. Cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) and cdk inhibitors are the principle regulators of cell cycle progression, especially in the G1 to S phase transition checkpoints. The activity of cyclin-dependent kinase can be inhibited by two groups of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Of these, p21WAF1/CIP1 plays an essential role in growth arrest (18Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar) and also directly inhibits DNA polymerase activity by binding to the PCNA subunit (19Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). p21-null mice are more prone to spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis (20Weinberg W.C. Fernandez-Salas E. Morgan D.L. Shalizi A. Mirosh E. Stanulis E. Deng C. Hennings H. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2050-2054PubMed Google Scholar), and pathological studies demonstrate that p21 expression correlates with a high apoptotic index in tumor cells, consistent with a favorable outcome in breast cancer patients (21Schondorf T. Gohring U.J. Becker M. Hoopmann M. Schmidt T. Rutzel S. Rein D.T. Ulrich U. Fechteler R. Bersch A. Mallmann P. Valter M.M. Pathobiology. 2004; 71: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It is known that p21 is primarily regulated by p53 (22el Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar) but also by p53-independent mechanisms. Because p53 abnormalities are reported in more than 50% of human cancers, identifying a p21 regulatory mechanism that is p53-independent may suggest a novel cancer therapeutic approach. We now report that p21 is likely regulated by RXRα homodimer and that RXR-mediated up-regulation of p21 causes a cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 in p53-null cancer cells, thus identifying a novel regulatory mechanism of the p21 signaling pathway. Ligands—9-cis-Retinoic acid, methoprene acid, and TTNPB were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth, PA). RXR-selective pan-agonist AGN 194204 was a kind gift from Allergan Co. Ltd. (Irvine, CA). Cell Culture—MDA-MB-231 mammary gland cancer cell line, H1299, non-small cell lung cancer cell line (NSCLC), and COS-1 African green monkey kidney cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Calu6 NSCLC cell lines were a generous gift from Dr. Jonathan Wiest (NCI, National Institutes of Health). MB-231 cells and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and H1299 and Calu6 NSCLC cell lines were maintained in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Western Blot—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (23Tanaka T. Dancheck B.L. Trifiletti L.C. Birnkrant R.E. Taylor B.J. Garfield S.H. Thorgeirsson U. De Luca L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3972-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with the following primary antibodies: anti-RXRα, -RARα, -RARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p21, pRb (Pharmingen), cyclin E, cyclin D, p27, p15, p16 (Neomarker), and actin (Chemicon). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (24Tanaka T. Rodriguez de la Concepcion M.L. De Luca L.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with the primary antibodies anti-rabbit p21 or anti-rabbit E2F (Neomarker). Immunocomplex was detected by immunoblot using biotinylated cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (Neomarker), or pRB antibody and horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce). Tet-On and -Off MDA-MB-231 Cell Lines—Plasmid containing rtTA or tTA (Clontech) was transfected to MB-231 cells, and Tet-On positive clones were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1200 mg/ml of Geneticin for 10 days. To generate stable clones, single colonies were picked and subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis to detect VP16 expression followed by reporter assays using a recombinant adenovirus encoding TRE-luciferase. Construction of Reporter Plasmids and Reporter Assay—A series of p21 promoter deletion mutants were generated by PCR with sense primers containing XhoI: from -1916 to +13, 5′-agtactagacacttagt-3′, from -1597 to +55, 5′-agcgaaggtgcagacagcag-3′, from -1014 to +55, 5′-aaggatgacaagcagagag-3′, from -651 to +55, 5′-tatacttaagttcagtggac-3′, and from -312 to +55, 5′-actcattctccaagta-3′), and an antisense primer containing HindIII, 5′-tcggtgcctcggcgaat-3′, and ligated into pGL-3 (Promega). Short deletion of putative RXRE (Fig. 3C) was generated by using Gene Editor system (Promega). Integrity of each clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid containing the p21 promoter sequence was co-transfected with RXR expression vector and pCMV-β-gal (Promega) to COS-1 cells. Transfection efficiency was normalized by β-galactosidase, and the luciferase activities from the treated cells were measured as described by the manufacturer (Promega). The light intensity was measured by a luminometer TROPIX TR717 (PerkinElmer Life Science). Data represent the means of at least triplicate experiments. Northern Blot—Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (24Tanaka T. Rodriguez de la Concepcion M.L. De Luca L.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with p21 cDNA. p21 mRNA was visualized by a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and normalized by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. EMSA—Nuclear proteins were prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells as described previously (24Tanaka T. Rodriguez de la Concepcion M.L. De Luca L.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and recombinant RXR and RAR were purchased from ProteinOne (Rockville, MD). Equal amounts of nuclear proteins (10 μg) were incubated with 20,000 cpm of appropriate oligonucleotide probes in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 8% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 20 min at room temperature with or without RXR ligand (10-6 m). For supershift assay, 0.4 μl of RXR antibody (3A2, a kind gift from Dr. Pierre Chambon, INSERM, France) was incubated with the DNA-protein complex. Gene Silencing Using siRNA—The cells were transfected with 100 nm concentrations of appropriate siRNA or nonspecific siRNA as a control. 5′-GACCAUGUGGACCUGUCACUU-3′ siRNA (p21siRNA405) was used to knock down p21, and 5′-GAACAUGGUGUACACGUGU-3′ siRNA (RARα + -γ siRNA354) was used to knock down RARα and RARγ. Cell Cycle Analysis—Ethanol-fixed cells were incubated with 100 units of RNase at room temperature for 20 min and incubated in propidium iodide for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Cell cycle was analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter Vantage instrument (BD Biosciences). Xenograft—5-week-old female BalbC nu/nu nude mice were maintained in a VAF-barrier facility, and all animal procedures were performed in accordance with the regulation in the National Institute of Health Guidelines. Five million MDA-MB-231 cells (300 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were injected subcutaneously into the back of nude mice and allowed to establish tumors for 2–3 weeks (∼400–500 mm3) before intratumoral injection with adenovirus expressing RXRα (Ad-RXRα) or control (Ad-null). Tumor masses were injected with either Ad-null or Ad-RXRα (1 × 108 plaque-forming units/tumor) every 4 days for 4 consecutive times (one cycle), and each cycle was repeated with a 1-week interval. Mice were given oral weekly doses of 50 μl of either RXR ligand (9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA); 3 mg/kg body weight in 50 μl of sesame oil) or solvent control (sesame oil) by gavage. Histological Analysis—BrdUrd (20 mg/ml) was injected to mice intraperitoneally 1 h before harvesting the tumors. Dissected tumors were fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. For immunohistochemistry, the slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and antigen was retrieved at 100 °C for 2 min in pH 7.0. In vivo apoptosis was detected by Apoptag kit (Biovision). In situ cell proliferation assay was performed as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Statistical Analysis—Values are the means ± S.D. The difference between the means of the treatment groups and appropriate controls were assessed with the paired two tailed t test; difference were considered to be significant if p < 0.05. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed by following the manufacturer's instruction (Upstate). Shared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with the following antibodies; 2.5 μl of RXR, RAR (a kind gift from Dr. Pierre Chambon, INSERM, France), and 5 μl of PPAR (Cayman, CA). The same amount of IgG was used for control. The chromatins were reverse cross-linked and used for PCR with sense primers 5′-TGTTCAGATGAACAATCCAT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TGGAAGTGTCTACTGGTTCTT-3′ spanning the p21 RXREs region. Ligand-dependent Activation of RXRα Induces G1 Cell Cycle Arrest—We previously reported that the highly malignant human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 does not respond to RXR ligand due to altered localization of RXRα to the splicing factor compartment, thereby sequestering its functional activity as a nuclear receptor (23Tanaka T. Dancheck B.L. Trifiletti L.C. Birnkrant R.E. Taylor B.J. Garfield S.H. Thorgeirsson U. De Luca L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3972-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, MB-231 was used in this study as RXRα functional knock-out cells to investigate biological mechanisms of the anti-cancer effect of RXRα in vivo and in vitro. RXRα overexpression or RXR ligand treatment alone in MB-231 cells did not induce G0/G1 arrest (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the combination of RXRα overexpression and RXR ligand treatment (column 8) induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, increasing the G0/G1 population by 16% over Ad-null infected non-treated cells at 36 h (Fig. 1A). In the presence of RXR, RAR ligand showed no effect on cell cycle, suggesting the cell cycle arrest was essentially mediated by RXR ligand (data not shown). To elucidate the mechanism underlying RXR-mediated G0/G1 arrest in response to RXR ligand, we examined the expression of cell cycle markers that control G1/S transition. Immunoblots showed that RXR ligand treatment up-regulated p21 within 24 h, and hyperphosphorylated pRb was significantly reduced within 48 h (Fig. 1B). RXRα overexpression and ligand treatment did not alter expression of other G1 cell cycle regulators, including p15, p16, p27, and cyclin D. Cyclin E was reduced with RXRα overexpression, but this reduction was not ligand-dependent (Fig. 1B). RXR overexpression also induced p21 in a RXR ligand-dependent manner in MCF-7 breast cancer cells ( supplemental data). Furthermore, RXR ligand treatment caused an increased amount of p21 and cyclin E cell cycle inhibitory complex in the presence of RXR, but the formation of p21 and cyclin D complex was not increased (Fig. 1C). RXR ligand also facilitated the formation of E2F-Rb complex, indicating that G1/S transition was blocked (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, p21 siRNA reduced the expression of p21 (Fig. 1E) and inhibited the RXRα-mediated G0/G1 arrest (Fig. 1D), indicating that p21 up-regulation is a primary biological response to RXR-mediated cell growth arrest. RXR Ligand Regulates p21 Expression—A possible regulatory mechanism of the RXR-mediated p21 up-regulation was investigated under different experimental conditions by varying the type, duration, or concentration of ligand treatment and the amount of exogenous RXR expression. p21 expression increased within 2 h of RXR ligand treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2Ai) at the physiological ligand concentration of 10-9 m and higher (Fig. 2Aii). Increase in p21 expression was also directly proportional to the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) for adenovirus encoding RXRα (Fig. 2Aiii). The ligands known to activate RXR homodimers (9cRA, AGN194204, SR11345, and methoprene acid) induced p21 expression (Fig. 2Aiv). The ligands that are specific for RXR heterodimer partners such as RAR and vitamin D receptor failed to induce p21, whereas PPAR ligand induced p21 expression slightly (Fig. 2Av). Consistent with the protein expression, Northern blot showed that p21 transcript was up-regulated within 2 h of RXR ligand treatment (Fig. 2B). To further verify whether RXR regulates p21 transcription, a reporter construct containing the 2.4-kb p21 promoter was co-transfected with RXRα expression vector into COS-1 cells and then treated with RXR ligand. p21 reporter assays demonstrated that RXR ligand in combination with RXR overexpression markedly increased p21 promoter activity when compared with controls or RXR overexpression alone (Fig. 2Ci). p21 promoter activity was also elevated to a similar extent in response to all the other RXR ligands (Fig. 2Cii). Expression of RXRα induced p21 promoter activity to a significantly higher level than the RXRβ and γ isoforms. This indicates that RXRα is the favored isotype for p21 transcription (Fig. 2Ciii). p21 promoter activities increased in a RXR ligand concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 2Civ). RXR ligand-induced p21 promoter activation was increased in a RXR dose-dependent manner. However, the two phase responses may indicate a possible involvement of more than one dimer with different affinity for RXR ligand such as PPAR. In fact, PPAR ligand (wy14643) activates not only p21 protein expression (Fig. 2Av) but also p21 promoter activity ( supplemental data). Together, these data demonstrate that p21 transcription is specifically regulated by the ligand-activated RXR. p21 Promoter Contains RXRE—To identify a possible RXR regulatory element in the human p21 promoter, a series of deletion mutants was generated and co-transfected with RXRα expression vector into COS-1 cells. RXR-ligand dependent p21 promoter activity did not significantly change after deletion up to -1.6 kb (Fig. 3A). However, the promoter activity was dramatically reduced when the deletion extended below -1.0 kb, indicating that the region between -1.6 and -1.0 kb contains a cis-element that responds to RXR ligand (Fig. 3A). Based on a bioinformatics program (Transfac Version 7.0), two putative RXR binding motifs were found in the region 22 bp apart from each other (Fig. 3B). RXRE1 (-1198 to -1186, 5′-AGGTCAgGGGTGT-3′) was highly homologous to the major histocompatibility complex type RXRE, and RXRE2 (-1221 to -1209, 5′-GAGGCAaAGGTGA-3′) was 75% homologous to the canonical RXRE (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, both RXRE1 and RXRE2 sequences overlap with a previously reported RAR/RXR heterodimer binding sequence (RARE) (25Liu M. Iavarone A. Freedman L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31723-31728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To determine whether these putative RXREs are direct transcriptional targets for RXRα, the RXRE sequences were deleted in multiple combinations. The deletion of both RXRE1 and RXRE2 abolished the ligand-mediated p21 promoter activity close to the baseline level, but deletion of RXRE1 or RXRE2 alone partially reduced the promoter activity (Fig. 3B). Thus, both RXRE1 and RXRE2 are functional elements for RXR signaling. RXRα Homodimer Binds to p21 RXREs—To confirm whether RXRα binds to the RXRE sites of p21 promoter, EMSA was performed with three different 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes as shown in Fig. 3Ci (RXREs/RARE probe contains the region spanning RXRE1, RXRE2, and RARE, RXRE1 probe spanning only RXRE1, and RXRE2 probes only spanning RXRE2). Nuclear protein extracts from the MB-231 cells infected with Ad-RXRα formed a greater amount of DNA-protein complex than the Ad-null-infected control (Fig. 3Cii). In agreement with the previous report (26Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), RXR ligand further facilitated the formation of DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 3Cii). The complex formation was completely abolished when an excess amount of specific non-radiolabeled oligonucleotide was added (Fig. 3Cii). To confirm RXRα binding to the RXRE probes, RXRα and RAR antibodies were used for a supershift assay. The DNA-protein complexes were supershifted by RXRα antibody but not by RARα antibody or pre-immune serum (Fig. 3Cii). Consistent biding properties were detected in all three different DNA probes. Bacterially expressed recombinant RXRα also formed a DNA-protein complex with all p21 RXREs, and these complex formations were increased when a greater amount of recombinant RXRα was added (Fig. 3Ciii), demonstrating that RXR homodimer binds to both RXRE1 and RXRE2. Notably RXR homodimer binding to RXREs/RARE resulted in the same migration as binding to RXRE1 and RXRE2 alone, suggesting that RXR homodimer may selectively bind to either RXRE1 or RXRE2. These data demonstrate that RXR homodimers bind to p21 RXREs and that the presence of RXR ligand significantly increases the DNA binding affinities of RXR. These data were also supported by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay which showed that RXR ligand induced RXR binding to the p21 promoter region, indicating RXR homodimer binding to the RXREs. Notably, RAR also binds weakly to the p21 promoter, but this interaction was not RXR ligand-dependent (Fig. 3D). Ligand-mediated RXRα Activation Inhibits the Growth of MB-231-grafted Tumors—To assess the efficacy of RXRα as a therapeutic molecule in vivo, MB-231 cells were used to generate subcutaneous tumors in nude mice, and RXRα expression in those tumors was achieved by intratumoral injection of Ad-RXRα. Fluorescence microscopy of Ad-GFP-injected tumor sections showed a high GFP expression in tumor cells, indicating an efficient delivery of recombinant adenovirus by intratumoral injection (Fig. 4A, upper panel). Maximum expression of RXRα in Ad-injected tumors was detected within the proximity of the needle track as designated by N (Fig. 4A, lower panel). RXR ligand administration to the mice that received Ad-null caused reduction in tumor size by ∼20% when compared with sesame oil (Fig. 4B). The inhibitory effect on tumor growth was up to 60% with a combination of RXRα and RXR ligand, suggesting that the ligand-mediated RXR activation maximized the anti-tumor activity (Fig. 4B). Histological analysis showed that Ad-RXRα and subsequent RXR ligand administration reduced the number of BrdUrd-positive cells by 70% (Fig. 4Ci) and increased the number of terminal dUTP nick-end labeling positive cells significantly (Fig. 4Cii) when compared with the tumors injected with Ad-null or Ad-RXRα treated with sesame oil. In contrast, immunoblot analysis of these tumor lysates confirmed that p21 protein expression was 2.5-fold higher in the tumors treated with Ad-RXRα and RXR ligand than in controls (Fig. 4D). RAR Inhibits RXR Homodimer-mediated p21 Transactivation—The overlap of RARE with two RXREs in the p21 promoter raised the question as to whether RAR/RXR heterodimer binds to the RARE and interferes with the binding of RXR/RXR homodimers to the RXREs, in turn promoting a loss of RXR ligand-mediated p21 transactivation. RXR overexpression induced p21 promoter activity in the presence of RXR ligand (Fig. 5A, column 4 and 6); however, this RXR ligand-dependent p21 activation was reduced when RAR was co-expressed (Fig. 5A, column 10). RAR overexpression also induced p21 promoter activation in response to RAR ligand (Fig. 5A, column 8, 9, 11, and 12) but minimal activation in response to RXR ligand (Fig. 5A, column 7). This suggests that RAR/RXR heterodimer formation may inhibit RXR homodimer-mediated p21 transactivation. This RAR-mediated inhibitory effect was abrogated when RARE/DR5 was changed to RARE/DR3 (Fig. 5B), suggesting that RAR/RXR binding to the RARE regulates RXR homodimer-mediated p21 transactivation. To verify this RAR/RXR binding, a similar experiment was conducted by EMSA with a fixed amount of recombinant RXR and increasing amounts of recombinant RAR (Fig. 5C). RXR homodimer bound to p21 RXRE but did not bind to RARE (Fig. 5C) and increased amounts of RAR abolished RXR homodimer binding (Fig. 5C), suggesting that RAR/RXR heterodimer preferentially bound to RARE and inhibited RXR homod"

https://openalex.org/W2006168221,"We have developed a novel system for expressing recombinant actin in Dictyostelium. In this system, the C terminus of actin is fused to thymosin β via a glycine-based linker. The fusion protein is purified using a His tag attached to the thymosin β moiety and then cleaved by chymotrypsin immediately after the native final residue of actin to yield intact actin. Wild-type actin prepared in this way was functionally normal in terms of its polymerization kinetics and muscle myosin-mediated motility. We expected that this system would be particularly useful for expressing toxic actin mutants, because the actin moiety of the fusion protein is unlikely to interact with the actin cytoskeleton of the host cells. We therefore chose to express the E206A/R207A/E208A mutant, which appears to be dominant lethal in yeast, as a model case of a toxic actin mutant that is difficult to express. We found that the E206A/R207A/E208A mutant could be expressed and purified with a yield comparable to the wild-type molecule (3–4 mg/20 g cells), even though green fluorescent protein-fused actin carrying the E206A/R207A/E208A mutation was expressed at a much lower level than wild-type actin. Purified E206A/R207A/E208A actin did not polymerize, even in the presence of muscle actin; however, it accelerated polymerization of muscle actin and inhibited the nucleating and severing activities of gelsolin. Given that the location of the substituted residues is near the pointed end face of the mutant, we suggest that E206A/R207A/E208A actin behaves like a weak pointed end-capping protein that perturbs the actin cytoskeleton of the host cells.

Actin filaments in live cells undergo continuous, dynamic turnover and remodeling. These processes involve polymerization, depolymerization, severing, capping, and branching of actin filaments through interaction with a vast array of actin-binding proteins. At present, understanding how the activities of these proteins are regulated is a major issue in cell biology. In addition, it is known that subunits within actin filaments are able to take different conformations and that, in certain cases, large blocks of subunits spanning long distances within individual filaments undergo cooperative conformational changes (1Oosawa F.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). For instance, in the case of thin filaments in striated muscle, Ca2+-triggered conformational changes in the filaments are enhanced by cooperative conformational changes induced by myosin (reviewed in Ref. 7Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). In other cases, however, the physiological function of cooperative conformational changes in actin subunits remains unclear. Thus, a number of interesting questions as to the structure and function of actin filaments remain unanswered. Dominant negative actin mutations have been identified from genetic screens, and these mutants may be useful for the elucidation of actin functions, because the use of dominant negative mutant proteins often provides a unique means of dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying complex phenomena, particularly those that involve direct interaction among multiple proteins. For instance, Wertman et al. (8Wertman K.F. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that two mutant actin alleles (E205A/R206A/E207A triple mutant and K326A/K328A double mutant; numbers are according to ACT15 actin of Dictyostelium discoideum without counting the first methionine) identified in their alanine-scanning analysis are dominant lethal in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, because it was not possible to recover diploid strains carrying a wild-type copy and a mutant copy. Interestingly, if incorporated into an actin filament the triple mutation would be near the pointed end surface of the molecule, while the double mutation would be exposed on the barbed end surface. This suggests the possibility that these two mutants modify the properties of either end of the filaments in the cells, thereby interfering with the functions of the wild-type molecules within the same cells (8Wertman K.F. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has not been possible to test this or any other hypothesis; however, because yeast cells expressing these mutants do not grow, even in the presence of the wild-type gene. The Act88F allele in Drosophila is another source of dominant negative actin mutations. The Act88F allele is expressed only in the indirect flight muscle and affects the insect's ability to fly, which is dispensable for its life cycle. An and Mogami (9An H.S. Mogami K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 492-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) took advantage of these unique features of Act88F and identified 15 dominant negative actin alleles that resulted in a no flight phenotype in the presence of a wild-type allele. They further demonstrated that 10 of 15 dominant negative alleles inhibited flight, even when three copies of the wild-type gene were present, suggesting that these mutants are strongly dominant negative (antimorphic). Purification of mutant Act88F actins from fly tissues (10Anson M. Drummond D.R. Geeves M.A. Hennessey E.S. Ritchie M.D. Sparrow J.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1991-2003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and in vitro translation (11Drummond D.R. Hennessey E.S. Sparrow J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have been achieved, but the quantities obtained are small and the product is impure, so that detailed characterization of these antimorphic actin mutants has not yet been achieved. Clearly, an efficient system with which to express recombinant dominant actin mutants would be highly desirable. Aspenstrom and Karlsson (12Aspenstrom P. Karlsson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and Sutoh et al. (13Sutoh K. Ando M. Toyoshima Y.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7711-7714Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) were the first to express a recombinant actin mutant, using S. cerevisiae and the cellular slime mold D. discoideum, respectively. In these cases, it was possible to separate the mutant and endogenous actins using ion exchange chromatography. However, to isolate actin mutants without altering the charge of the molecules, it is necessary to either attach an affinity tag to the recombinant protein or use the single endogenous actin gene expressed in yeast as the basis for mutagenesis. Fusion of Dictyostelium actin with a polyhistidine or FLAG tag tends to cause aggregation of the protein during purification (14Abe A. Saeki K. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 3N. Kanzaki and T. P. Q. Uyeda, unpublished results. The yeast system allows isolation of mutant actin without using an affinity tag (e.g. Ref. 15Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it is only applicable to mild mutations that support growth of the host cells. A baculovirus-insect cell expression system was recently used to express both untagged wild-type and polymerization-incompetent mutant actins with high yields (16Joel P.B. Fagnant P.M. Trybus K.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11554-11559Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This is promising, but with this system it would be difficult to separate the mutant from the endogenous actin if the actin mutant was polymerization-competent, and it has not been shown to express dominant negative mutant actins with reasonable yields. We therefore developed a novel strategy to express toxic, dominant negative actin mutants without directly fusing affinity tags. For this purpose, we fused profilin or thymosin β to the C terminus of actin via a long, flexible linker. It was our expectation that the profilin or thymosin β moiety would act intramolecularly to inhibit polymerization of the actin moieties, so that the actin would not exert toxic effects on the host cells, even if the mutant was dominant negative in nature. Once purified using an affinity tag fused to the C terminus of profilin or thymosin β, we expected that the profilin or thymosin β moiety, together with the linker, could be easily separated from the actin moiety using chymotrypsin. Here we report that this strategy works nicely, enabling us to purify actin mutants that are dominant lethal in yeast, and to perform biochemical studies on them. Plasmid Construction and Cell Culture-To facilitate future mutagenesis, the act15 gene from D. discoideum was modified to have following four unique restriction sites: AatII (18Liu X. Ito K. Morimoto S. Hikkoshi-Iwane A. Yanagida T. Uyeda T.Q.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14124-14129Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), HpaI (318), XhoI (700), and KpnI (912) (numbers denote the cutting site counted from the initiation codon). In addition, an NheI site was generated in place of the native stop codon to produce AR. The AR sequence was fused to synthetic sequences encoding a glycine-based linker, human thymosin β with the Dictyostelium codon bias, an His8 tag, and a stop codon. The resultant fusion gene was termed ART. In some experiments, act15 was fused to His-tagged pfiI (17Haugwitz M. Noegel A.A. Karakesisoglou J. Schleicher M. Cell. 1994; 79: 303-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) from Dictyostelium using the same linker, yielding AP. The ART or AP genes were placed between the act15 promoter and mhcA terminator and then subcloned into pTIKL extrachromosomal expression vector (18Liu X. Ito K. Morimoto S. Hikkoshi-Iwane A. Yanagida T. Uyeda T.Q.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14124-14129Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to yield pTIKLART or pTIKLAP. The A617C/A619G/G620C/A621T/A623C mutation, which encodes E206A/R207A/E208A, was made in the HpaI-XhoI fragment of AR in a cloning vector and subcloned into pTIKLART to yield pTIKLART(PM). Likewise, a mutation encoding K326A/K328A was made in the KpnINheI fragment of AR in a cloning vector and then subcloned into pTIKLART to yield pTIKLART(BM). The act15 promoter and the GFP 4The abbreviations used are: GFPgreen fluorescent proteinBMbarbed end mutation. coding sequence from pBIG GFP-actin (19Asano Y. Mizuno T. Kon T. Nagasaki A. Sutoh K. Uyeda T.Q. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 59: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was inserted into pTIKLART, yielding pTIKL GFP-ART. PCR-based mutagenesis was then employed to regenerate the native stop codon in the act15 gene, yielding pTIKL GFP-actin. The A617C/A619G/G620C/A621T/A623C mutation was subcloned into pTIKL GFP-actin to yield pTIKL GFP-PM-actin. green fluorescent protein barbed end mutation. Using electroporation (20Egelhoff T.T. Titus M.A. Manstein D.J. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Dictyostelium cells, either Ax2 wild-type or HS1 lacking the single myosin II heavy chain gene (21Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were transfected with pTIKL-based plasmids. Cells that grew at 21 °C in the HL5 medium (22Sussman M. D. discoideum: Molecular Approaches to Cell Biology. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref Scopus (533) Google Scholar) containing 60 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin and 12 μg/ml G418 were used for microscopic observation, and their whole cell lysates were subjected to Western analysis. For biochemical purification of actin, cells were passed to a medium containing 40 μg/ml G418 and ultimately were diluted into two 5-liter flasks, each containing 2 liters of HL5 medium without G418 on a rotary shaker (in the case of cells derived from wild-type cells) or to several 25-× 25-cm square plastic plates containing 200 ml of HL5 medium without G418. Purification of Recombinant Actin-All procedures were carried out at 0–5 °C. Cells expressing ART, PM-ART, or AP were harvested, washed twice by low speed centrifugation and resuspension, and then suspended in 2 vol/g of the binding buffer (10 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol). They were then lysed by addition of 2 volumes of binding buffer containing 1.25% Triton X-100 and proteinase inhibitors and centrifuged at 36,000 × g for 30 min. The resultant supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 1–2 h, and the resin with bound proteins was washed and then extracted in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 200 mm imidazole, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The resultant crude fusion protein fraction was dialyzed against G-buffer (5 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% NaN3) and then digested with 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated chymotrypsin (Sigma, 200:1 w/w ratio) for 10 min at 25 °C. After quenching the reaction with 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the digested mixture was applied to an Econo-Pac High Q Cartridge (Bio Rad) pre-equilibrated with G-buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient in G-buffer. Fractions with intact actin were pooled and, in the case of polymerizable actins, ultracentrifuged after being supplemented with 1 mm MgATP. The pellets were dissolved in G-buffer, and after dialysis against G-buffer, clarified by ultra-centrifugation to yield purified recombinant actin. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared using the method of Spudich and Watt (23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling of actin with N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes) or N-((4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-yl)methyl)iodoacetamide (BODIPY FL C1-IA, Molecular Probes) was carried out as described previously (24Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 25Terada N. Shimozawa T. Ishiwata S. Funatsu T. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 2162-2171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Gelsolin was purified from bovine plasma as described previously (26Kurokawa H. Fujii W. Ohmi K. Sakurai T. Nonomura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Polymerization Assay-Actin was allowed to polymerize in F-buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with or without 33 μm phalloidin for 30 min at room temperature, after which it was ultracentrifuged at 30,0000 × g for 6 min at 25 °C. The resultant pellet and supernatant fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Spectroscopic Measurements-Rabbit skeletal muscle actin (20% pyrene-labeled) at 1 μm in G-buffer was induced to polymerize in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 21 °C. In some experiments, extra muscle actin, PM-actin, and/or gelsolin were included. Increases in 407 nm fluorescence elicited by excitation at 365 nm were monitored using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (RF-5300PC, Shimadzu) with the shutter under manual control to minimize photodamage. Microscopic Observation-Dictyostelium cells expressing GFP-actin were plated in a glass-bottomed Petri dish (Iwaki Glass) and incubated for 1–2 h in Loflo medium developed by Dr. H. MacWilliams (Ludwig-Maximilians Universität München). They were then observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (19Asano Y. Mizuno T. Kon T. Nagasaki A. Sutoh K. Uyeda T.Q. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 59: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To qualitatively assay the actin-severing activity of gelsolin, the distribution of lengths of rhodamine phalloidin-labeled actin filaments was characterized using fluorescence microscopy. Approximately 0.8 μm muscle actin filaments in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol were labeled with a stoichiometric amount of rhodamine phalloidin. To this solution of labeled actin filaments was added 1/200 (mol/mol) gelsolin or gelsolin preincubated with 20-fold molar excess PM-actin in G-buffer. After incubation for 5 min on ice, each solution was diluted 1:100 in the same buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. An aliquot of each solution was sandwiched between a glass slide and a glass coverslip coated with polylysine for observation. Phenotype of Dictyostelium Cells Expressing E205A/R206A/E207A (PM) Mutant Actin-To determine whether actin carrying the E205A/R206A/E207A triple mutation, hereafter called PM-actin, is toxic to Dictyostelium, a mutant act15 gene carrying this triple mutation and fused N-terminally to GFP (19Asano Y. Mizuno T. Kon T. Nagasaki A. Sutoh K. Uyeda T.Q. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 59: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was expressed in Dictyostelium cells. Actin fused N-terminally to GFP through a flexible linker is able to copolymerize normally with endogenous actin in Dictyostelium (19Asano Y. Mizuno T. Kon T. Nagasaki A. Sutoh K. Uyeda T.Q. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 59: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Westphal M. Jungbluth A. Heidecker M. Muhlbauer B. Heizer C. Schwartz J.M. Marriott G. Gerisch G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 176-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and we were able to evaluate the expression of the mutant form separately from the endogenous actin by SDS-PAGE. Colonies appeared and grew at similar rates after transfection of wild-type cells with plasmids encoding either GFP-actin or GFP-PM-actin and selection in the presence of 12 μg/ml G418. Likewise, the growth rates in suspension cultures in HL5 medium containing 12 μg/ml G418 were very similar (data not shown). Western analysis of whole cell lysates using an anti-GFP antibody or a monoclonal anti-actin antibody revealed that the level of GFP-PM-actin expression in these cells is much lower than that of GFP-actin expression (Fig. 1A). This suggests PM-actin is also toxic to Dictyostelium cells but that a fraction of the cells somehow down-regulated expression of GFP-PM-actin and managed to grow at rates comparable to cells expressing GFP-actin. Fluorescence microscopic observation of live cells further confirmed that the level of GFP-PM-actin expression was lower than that of GFP-actin expression. Although cells expressing GFP-PM-actin were less fluorescent than those expressing GFP-actin, some expressed sufficient amounts of GFP-PM-actin for detailed observation. In those cells, the GFP fluorescence was mostly cytoplasmic. Accumulation of GFP-PM-actin in the pseudopods and crowns was sometimes observed (Fig. 1D), but to a smaller extent than GFP-actin (Fig. 1C), which suggests PM-actin has a polymerization defect. Design of Actin-thymosin Fusion Protein for High Level Expression and Purification-To further characterize PM-actin biochemically, we set out to develop a system to efficiently express toxic actin mutants. Based on the assumption that, in vivo, PM-actin is incorporated into actin filaments and somehow interferes with their function, we reasoned that fusion with a protein that inhibits actin polymerization (e.g. profilin or thymosin β) would prevent copolymerization of PM-actin with endogenous actin, thereby diminishing its toxicity. Profilin or thymosin β was fused to the C terminus of actin so that the fusion would not interfere with the post-translational processing of the N terminus of the actin moiety. A 14-residue, glycine-based linker was designed to bridge the 3.1 nm gap between the C terminus of actin and the N terminus of profilin in the crystal structure of the actin-profilin complex (28Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), or the 1.8 nm gap between the C terminus of actin and the N terminus of thymosin β in the model structure of the actin-thymosin complex (29Domanski M. Hertzog M. Coutant J. Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Bontems F. Carlier M.F. Guittet E. van Heijenoort C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 19: 23637-23645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The native terminal residue of actin is Phe, which provides a convenient cleavage site for chymotrypsin, between actin and the linker sequence; actin is relatively resistant to chymotrypsin, otherwise (30Jacobson G.R. Rosenbusch J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2742-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Finally, a polyhistidine tag was fused to the C terminus of profilin or thymosin β to aid biochemical purification without causing aggregation (Fig. 2A). We expected that the actin-profilin/thymosin β-His fusion protein would be expressed at high levels with minimal impact on the cellular actin cytoskeleton, that we would be able to purify it relatively easily using nickel-affinity chromatography, and that the intact actin molecule could be released from the fusion protein by chymotrypsin and separated from the profilin/thymosin β-His tag moiety by ion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2B). We generated constructs using the promoter and coding sequences of act15 from D. discoideum plus either pfiI from Dictyostelium or a synthetic human thymosin β sequence coded in accordance with the Dictyostelium codon bias. These fusion genes, hereafter referred to as AP or ART, were subcloned into the pTIKL expression plasmid and introduced into Dictyostelium cells. Because preliminary assays indicated that mhcA-null HS1 cells express the ART fusion protein at higher levels than wild-type Ax2 cells, HS1 cells were used as the expression host. The high speed supernatant obtained from the cell lysate was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, after which specifically bound proteins were eluted from the resin using 200 mm imidazole. 60-kDa AP (data not shown) and 51-kDa ART (Fig. 3A) were the major proteins in the eluates. Although minor contaminants were also present, endogenous actin was not detected by Western blotting (data not shown). Ultracentrifugation of ART in F-buffer did not yield pellets, demonstrating that ART lacks the polymerization competence. This is further supported by the fact that GFP-ART is only diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1E). We then carried out a survey to determine the optimum conditions for chymotryptic digestion. When assayed against the ART fraction that had been dialyzed against G-buffer, digestion with chymotrypsin (1/200 w/w) for 10 min at 25 °C yielded the largest amount of free and intact actin; longer digestions increased actin nicking (Fig. 3B). The digestion products were then subjected to Q-Sepharose column chromatography, after which the actin-containing fractions were pooled and ultracentrifuged after supplementation with 1 mm MgATP. Intact actin pelleted efficiently (Fig. 3A), demonstrating the polymerization competence, whereas contaminating nicked actin tended to remain in the supernatant. The pelleted actin was dissolved in G-buffer, clarified by ultracentrifugation, and stored as purified recombinant actin. The yield of ART was better than AP and was typically 3–4 mg/20 g of cells (1.2 liters of culture). Characterization of Recombinant Actin Prepared from ART-Analysis of the amino acids of actin prepared from AP revealed that the N-terminal residue is an acetylated Asp and that His-73 is methylated, as is the case with endogenous actin (14Abe A. Saeki K. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Rubenstein P. Deuchler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11142-11147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Vandekerckhove J. Weber K. Nature. 1980; 284: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and that the C-terminal residue is the native Phe-374. Thus, the recombinant actin was properly modified post-translationally and had the correct terminal residues (data not shown). Measurements of the increases in fluorescence seen after Cys-374 was labeled with pyrene iodoacetamide indicated that the recombinant actin prepared from ART polymerizes at a slightly faster rate than the endogenous molecule (Fig. 3C). Polymerized actin filaments appeared normal when observed in an electron microscope after negative staining with uranyl acetate (Fig. 3D). In in vitro motility assays using rabbit skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin, the recombinant actin filaments moved at 3.1 ± 0.3 μm/s at 25 °C, which is only slightly slower than the filaments prepared from endogenous actin (3.7 ± 0.3 μm/s). We therefore conclude that the recombinant actin prepared from ART is normal, both functionally and structurally. We suggest that the small difference between the recombinant and endogenous actins may reflect either a difference in trace contaminating proteins or peptides and/or the presence of multiple actin isoforms in the endogenous actin preparation (33Romans P. Firtel R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Expression of PM-ART-We next introduced E206A/R207A/E208A mutation (the pointed-end mutation or PM) into the ART gene in the pTIKL expression plasmid and transfected wild-type Dictyostelium cells with the resultant plasmid. Western analysis of whole cell lysates indicated that PM-ART is expressed at a level comparable to that of wild-type ART (Fig. 1B), confirming that fusion with thymosin β is an effective way to boost expression of an actin mutant that is hardly expressed at all when fused with GFP. Fusion with profilin also effectively increased expression, although to a somewhat lesser extent (data not shown). We purified PM-actin in a manner similar to wild-type actin described above, except that the final polymerization step was omitted, because there was little or no PM-actin polymerization under the standard conditions (see below). PM-actin Is a Polymerization-deficient Mutant-When purified PM-actin was ultracentrifuged after incubation in F-buffer, most of the molecules remained in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2), although addition of excess phalloidin significantly reduced the size of the supernatant fraction (lanes 3 and 4). By contrast, addition of muscle actin did not noticeably reduce the amount of actin left in the supernatant, suggesting that PM-actin does not copolymerize with normal actin (lanes 5 and 6). However, it was impossible to tell how much PM-actin remained unpolymerized, because PM-actin and muscle actin comigrated when subjected to SDS-PAGE. To address this issue more quantitatively, we labeled PM-actin with BODIPY FL iodoacetamide at Cys-374, because it was recently shown that such labeling does not interfere with the polymerization competence of actin, and the fluorescence intensity of BODIPY FL does not change upon polymerization (25Terada N. Shimozawa T. Ishiwata S. Funatsu T. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 2162-2171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Measurement of fluorescence intensities in the supernatant and pellet fractions indicated that, in the absence and presence of 4.8 μm skeletal muscle actin, only 0.7 and 13%, respectively, of PM-actin was present in the pellet under our polymeri"
https://openalex.org/W2035062934,"Prior to binding to a high affinity peptide and transporting it to the cell surface, major histocompatibility complex class I molecules are retained inside the cell by retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), recycling through the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and possibly the cis-Golgi, or both. Using fluorescence microscopy and a novel in vitro COPII (ER-to-ER-Golgi intermediate compartment) vesicle formation assay, we find that in both lymphocytes and fibroblasts that lack the functional transporter associated with antigen presentation, class I molecules exit the ER and reach the cis-Golgi. Intriguingly, in wild-type T1 lymphoma cells, peptide-occupied and peptide-receptive class I molecules are simultaneously exported from ER membranes with similar efficiencies. Our results suggest that binding of high affinity peptide and exit from the ER are not coupled, that the major histocompatibility complex class I quality control compartment extends into the Golgi apparatus under standard conditions, and that peptide loading onto class I molecules may occur in post-ER compartments.

Their assembly with antigenic peptides and transport to the cell surface are regulated by a quality control mechanism that is insufficiently understood. The peptides, which are mostly generated by the cytosolic proteasome, are transported into the ER lumen by the ABC transporter, TAP (1Koch J. Tampe R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and bind there to class I molecules, which are dimers of a transmembrane heavy chain and the soluble light chain, β2-microglobulin (2Shastri N. Cardinaud S. Schwab S.R. Serwold T. Kunisawa J. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Initially, newly synthesized class I molecules bind mainly the abundant low affinity peptides that do not optimally match the length (8–10 amino acids) and sequence requirements for tight binding to a given heavy chain allele. During this time, these peptide-receptive (immature) class I molecules do not acquire endoglycosidase H (EndoH) resistance, i.e. they are retained in a compartment proximal to the medial Golgi (3Balch W.E. Keller D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14690-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an optimization process termed “peptide editing,” the low affinity peptides are exchanged for peptides of gradually increasing affinity until, with the binding of a sufficiently high affinity peptide, class I-peptide complexes are transported to the cell surface (4Williams A.P.

There, a specific peptide, for example of viral origin, can be detected by the cognate T cell receptor on a cytotoxic T lymphocyte, which then induces the apoptosis of the presenting cell. Peptide editing and regulated transport together ensure that every class I molecule will travel to the cell surface loaded with a high affinity (low dissociation rate) peptide that remains bound during transit and for some time afterward. The molecular mechanisms of these two processes are not well understood, but control of both editing and transport involves the MHC class I loading complex, an assembly of TAP, the protein-disulfide isomerases ERp57 and PDI (the protein-disulfide isomerase P4HB), and the chaperones tapasin and calreticulin, which bind directly to class I (5Cresswell P.

On the other hand, intracellular retention functions in the absence of tapasin but depends on the other members of the loading complex, except TAP (6Park B. Lee S. Kim E. Cho K. Riddell S.R. Cho S.

Res. 2006; 35: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is unknown how members of the loading complex identify peptide-receptive class I molecules and, once associated with them, how they prevent them from trafficking to the cell surface (12Wright C.A. Kozik P. Zacharias M. Springer S. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In general, proteins can be held in the early secretory pathway in two ways (13Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Some folded proteins, for example P450 cytochromes (14Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and ribophorins (15Fu J. Kreibich G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3984-3990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), as well as many misfolded mutant proteins, do not enter the COPII vesicles that bud from the ER and travel to the ERGIC; as a consequence, such proteins are restricted to the ER. In contrast, other predominantly ER-localized proteins, such as Sec61α (a subunit of the ER protein translocon (17Greenfield J.J. High S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and the ts045 mutant of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G (18Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar)), can also be found in the ERGIC and/or the cis-Golgi, which implies that they enter COPII vesicles but are then retrieved from a more distal compartment. Both mechanisms of localization, stringent retention and retrieval, act upon fully folded as well as misfolded proteins, and it is unknown how a given protein is “assigned” to one mechanism. In fact, some localization signals on folded proteins, such as a cytosolic C-terminal -K(X)KXX sequence on transmembrane proteins, support both retention and retrieval (19Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15080-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Barre L. Magdalou J. Netter P. Fournel-Gigleux S. Ouzzine M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To understand whether retention or retrieval localize peptide-receptive class I molecules to the early secretory pathway, investigators have resorted to using conditions where no peptides are available in the ER lumen, either because the TAP transporter is inactive or because the proteasome is chemically inhibited. In such cells, most class I alleles rapidly bind exogenous peptide added at the time of lysis (21Townsend A. Ohlen C. Bastin J. Ljunggren H.G. Foster L. Karre K. Nature. 1989; 340: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), and they do not become EndoH-resistant. In one such study, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of H-2Kb did not exit the ER upon proteasome inhibition but remained clustered with the loading complex as judged by fluorescence microscopy (22Spiliotis E.T. Manley H. Osorio M. Zuniga M.C. Edidin M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Others, in apparent contradiction, have found class I molecules in the ERGIC and/or the cis-Golgi in TAP mutant cells (23Hsu V.W. Yuan L.C. Nuchtern J.G. Lippincott S.J. Hämmerling G.J.

In addition to this unresolved controversy, recent data have raised the question whether these results, obtained from mutant cells and/or overexpressed GFP fusions of class I molecules, indeed represent the behavior of endogenous peptidereceptive class I molecules in wild-type cells. Especially the overexpression of an ER-retained protein may lead to its artifactual escape in yeast and mammalian cells (27Propsting M.J. Jacob R. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16310-16314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Hermosilla R. Oueslati M. Donalies U. Schonenberger E. Krause E. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schulein R.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), even though for the GFP fusions of HLA-A2, traffic similar to the wild-type protein has been demonstrated in pulse-chase experiments (31Gromme M. Uytdehaag F.G. Janssen H. Calafat J. van Binnendijk R.S. Kenter M.J. Tulp A. Verwoerd D. Neefjes J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10326-10331Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Indeed, the authors of the VSVG-ts045 study cited above suggest that this mutant protein exits the ER because its high rate of production saturates the ER quality control system. Thus, in studies where class I molecules were overexpressed, or where no peptide was available, ER quality control may have become overwhelmed to allow the nonphysiological exit of peptide-receptive class I molecules from the ER. Another point of controversy regarding the above studies is whether class I molecules in TAP-deficient cells are indeed biochemically equivalent to immature class I molecules in wild-type cells, i.e. whether they have low affinity peptides bound (32De Silva A.D. Boesteanu A. Song R. Nagy N. Harhaj E. Harding C.V. Joyce S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4413-4420PubMed Google Scholar) or not (33Anderson K.S. Alexander J. Wei M. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3407-3419PubMed Google Scholar). This difference is significant because even low affinity peptides induce a conformational change in the peptide binding groove of class I (34Springer S. Döring K. Skipper J.C. Townsend A.R. Cerundolo V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3001-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35Glithero A. Tormo J. Doering K. Kojima M. Jones E.Y. Elliott T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12699-12704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Such conformational variants can have different fates in the secretory pathway; in a recent study, out of eight disease-related mutants of the V2 vasopressin receptor, three did not leave the ER, but five (which had a different conformation) cycled through the ERGIC and the cis-Golgi prior to degradation (28Hermosilla R. Oueslati M. Donalies U. Schonenberger E. Krause E. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schulein R. Traffic. 2004; 5: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, the localization of class I molecules in TAP-deficient cells may follow different pathways and may be governed by different factors compared with peptide-receptive class I molecules in wild-type cells. We have now investigated the trafficking of endogenous peptide-receptive class I molecules in wild-type cells, both lymphocytes and fibroblasts. In addition to determining their steady-state distribution by fluorescence microscopy, we have assessed their rates of exit from the ER using a novel in vitro COPII vesicle formation assay. We demonstrate that under wild-type conditions, peptide-occupied and peptide-receptive class I molecules leave the ER at the same rate, but the latter are returned from the cis-Golgi. Our results suggest that under wild-type conditions peptide editing and class I exit from the ER are mechanistically independent, and they suggest a role for the ERGIC and the cis-Golgi in MHC class I quality control. Cells and Transfections—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and TAP-deficient CHO fibroblasts (stably transfected with H-2Db or H-2Kb), kindly provided by K. Gould (London, UK), were grown in 10-cm cell culture dishes in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% FCS and PSG (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine). Human T1 and T2 lymphoblastoid cell lines, a kind gift from A. Townsend (Oxford, UK), were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FCS and PSG. Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells were grown in 10-cm cell culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS and PSG.

Duden R. Soling H.D. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 139-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS and transferred into transfection medium (120 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, and 5 mm oxidized glutathione). About 1–2 million cells were transfected in 400 μl final volume with 20 μg of maxiprep DNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). CHO, TAP-deficient CHO, and Vero cells were transfected at 700 V and 50 microfarads with H-2Kb-GFP and H-2Db-GFP constructs. T1 and T2 cells were transfected at 240 V for 40 ms. Recombinant DNA Constructs and Expression Plasmids—The plasmid expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), which uses the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter for expression of the cloned insert and G418 resistance for selection of stable transfectants, and its derivative pECFP-N1 were used in all transfection experiments. A cDNA encoding wild-type H-2Kb (H2-K1) and H-2Db (H2-D1) was amplified by the PCR with a mutagenic 5′ primer containing a SalI site (H-2Kb, CCC CGT CGA CCA TGG TAC CGT GCA CGC TG; H-2Db, CCC CGT CGA CCA TGG GGG CGA TGG CTC CG) and a 3′ primer that replaces the stop codon with a BamHI restriction site (H-2Kb, GTG GAT C CG CTA GAG AAT GAG GGT CA, H-2Db; GTG GAT C CG CTT TAC AAT CTC GGA GAG A). The fragments were inserted in-frame into the polylinker of pEGFP-N1. Both constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. To obtain a Sec22-CFP expression construct, Sec22-GFP (obtained from R. Scheller, Stanford, CA) was subcloned into pECFP-N1. The ECFP fusion of rat p23 (Tmed10) was described in Ref. 36Majoul I. Straub M. Hell S.W. Duden R. Soling H.D. Dev.

Pure Peptides and Proteins—SIINFEKL (from ovalbumin, 257–264; H-2Db and H-2Kb), ILKEPVGHV (from human immunodeficiency virus polymerase, residues 476–484, HLA-A*0201), and QPRAPIRPI (from Epstein-Barr virus, EBNA 3C protein, 881–889, HLA-B*5101), purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, were from Biosyntan (Berlin, Germany). Hamster SAR1B (both wild-type and T39N mutant) bacterial expression plasmids were obtained from R. Schekman (Berkeley, CA); the proteins were purified according to the published protocol (41Kim J. Hamamoto S. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7758-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Buffers—Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contained 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 130 mm NaCl. TBS (Tris-buffered saline) is 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Buffer G consisted of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm sorbitol, 150 mm KOAc, and 0.5 mm Mg(OAc)2. Buffer E contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm sorbitol, 70 mm KOAc, 5 mm potassium EGTA, and 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2. Mammalian Cytosol—The cytosol preparation was adopted from a published protocol (16Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). All work was performed at 4 °C. Freshly excised livers from rats or Djungarian hamsters were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and cut into small pieces. One to two ml of Buffer E plus protease inhibitors (PI: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) and 1 mm dithiothreitol were added per g of liver, and the tissue was disrupted using a mortar and pestle. Homogenization was performed by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a loose pestle. The crude extract was spun at 25,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was filtered through one layer of gauze. After centrifugation at 186,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes, and the centrifugation was repeated. For the preparation of pig brain cytosol, brains (without meninges and cerebellum) were cut into pieces, washed with PBS, homogenized in 0.6 ml/g Buffer E plus protease inhibitors in a stainless steel blender, and centrifuged consecutively at 1,000 × g (10 min), 25,000 × g (10 min, with subsequent filtration through gauze), and 100,000 × g (1 h). The final supernatant usually had a protein concentration of 15–25 μg/ml as determined by the Bradford assay with a bovine serum albumin standard. Cytosol aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Preparation of Semi-intact Cells and Microsome-enriched Membranes—To prepare semi-intact cells, 2 million cells were washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS. Adherent cells (80–90% confluent 10-cm dishes) were scraped from the dishes in the third wash. Cells were spun at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl Buffer G, spun at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and again resuspended in Buffer G + PI. The cell suspension was shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 1 min and thawed in a 40 °C water bath. This procedure was carried out three times in total. After the freeze-thaw, semi-intact cells were pelleted at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed once in 200 μl of Buffer G + PI, and transferred to siliconized tubes. After another 800 × g spin for 5 min at 4 °C, the final pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of Buffer G + PI, and included in one budding reaction. Microsome-enriched membranes were prepared in Buffer G + PI as described (41Kim J. Hamamoto S. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7758-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In Vitro Vesicle Formation Assay for Nonlabeled Proteins (Immunoblot Analysis)—Each reaction contained Buffer G + PI, 30 μl of semi-intact cells, 8 mg/ml of cytosol, 0.2 mm GTP, an ATP-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 mg of creatine phosphokinase), and 500 nm Sar1 (where indicated), in an 80-μl final volume in siliconized tubes. After a 5-min preincubation on ice, budding was carried out at 25 °C for 30 min and terminated by transferring the tubes on ice. Except for the 100% (total) sample, fractions were spun at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to separate vesicles from donor membranes. Vesicles were then sedimented at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 25 min. The pellets were washed once with 100 μl of Buffer G, and the 100,000 × g spin was repeated. The pellets were resuspended in sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The samples were frozen at -20 °C or directly loaded onto 10% SDS-acrylamide gels. Nonlabeled proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Radiolabeling of Cells and Immunoprecipitation—For pulse-labeling experiments, cells were washed twice at room temperature with methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% FCS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. 200 μCi of [35S]methionine per 6 million cells were added, and the cells were incubated for a further 30 min at 37 °C. The labeled cells were washed in ice-cold Buffer G prior to microsome preparation. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were labeled for 15 min as above and then incubated at 37 °C in a complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% FCS for indicated periods of time. The cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 16,000 × g. Labeled proteins were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies prebound to protein A-agarose beads. Immune complexes were washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in TBS. Endoglycosidase Hf treatment, where indicated, was done according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). Samples were then resuspended in 2× sample buffer, incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, and loaded onto 11% SDS-acrylamide gels. After Coomassie Blue staining and destaining, gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed with a Fuji FLA-3000 imager (Fujifilm, Düsseldorf, Germany). In Vitro Vesicle Formation Assay for Labeled Proteins—For one budding reaction, ∼2 million cells were used. Cells were radiolabeled for 30 min, and radioactive microsomes were incubated with the budding reaction components as described above at 34 °C for 30 min. Vesicles were lysed overnight at 4 °C with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm iodoacetamide. Immunoprecipitation was performed as above. In Vitro Transcription, Translation, and Translocation—Full-length H-2Kd protein was produced in an in vitro transcription/translation system (Clontech) from pTM1 (42Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) in the presence of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cotranslationally translocated into microsome-enriched membranes prepared (as described above) from Raji cells. Following translocation, COPII vesicle generation, lysis of vesicles and donor membranes, and immunoprecipitation (using the conformation-specific mAb B22.249, (43Hämmerling G.J. Hämmerling U. Lemke H. Immunogenetics. 1979; 8: 433-445Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar)) were carried out as described above. Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Compartment Markers—Where indicated, cells were transfected with Sec22-CFP, p23-CFP, GalT-CFP, and MHC class I (H-2Kb-GFP or H-2Db-GFP, CHO cells only) constructs 24 h before fixation and staining. T1 and T2 cells were attached to coverslips with l-polylysine (Sigma) for 45 min at 37 °C and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100. Antibody incubations were performed in a moisturized chamber at room temperature for 1 h in the presence of blocking medium (0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for primary antibodies and (after washing) for 30 min for fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. Cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted with Mowiol (Sigma). CHO and Vero cells were spotted onto glass microscope slides in culture medium, incubated for 24 h, then washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times, and mounted onto microscope slides for observation. To arrest trafficking of class I molecules in the ERGIC, cells were incubated for 2 h at 15°C and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 15 °C. To accumulate class I molecules in the Golgi apparatus, cells were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 20 °C. Live cell images were taken at 37 °C, 24 h after transfection, with an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope, with excitation at 440 nm for CFP, 488 nm for GFP, and 514 nm for yellow fluorescent protein. Fixed cells were observed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Calnexin is a transmembrane protein that is localized to the ER at steady state (44Rajagopalan S. Xu Y. Brenner M.B.

https://openalex.org/W2089014768,The membrane potentials of isolated Drosophila mitochondria have been measured under a variety of conditions by microelectrodes driven by a piezoelectric device. The results support the interpretation that the potentials are the result of a distribution of ions imposed by a Donnan effect.
https://openalex.org/W2039046175,"It has been previously shown that both survivin and the survivin splice variant survivin-2B are localized in mitochondria. Whereas the mechanism involved in blockade of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by survivin has been extensively studied, the role of survivin-2B in regulation of apoptosis has not been well defined. In the present study, we report that in addition to mitochondria, survivin-2B is also localized in the microtubule organization center (MTOC) and, in contrast to other survivin isoforms (i.e. survivin and survivin-ΔEx3), behaves as a proapoptotic molecule. We show that forced expression of survivin-2B blocks tubulin polymerization, ablates mitotic cells, and induces mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. The mitochondria-mediated apoptosis induced by survivin-2B was indicated by Smac release from mitochondria, activation of caspases 9 and 3, and loss of mitochondrial potential, while caspase-8 remained inactive. Further analysis of the mechanism for the mitochondria-associated events of apoptosis induced by forced expression of survivin-2B revealed down-regulation of the pro-survival factor Bcl-2 and up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic factor Bax in mitochondria, while the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) remains unchanged. Our studies further showed that taxol (paclitaxel) treatment of cancer cells not only up-regulates survivin but also down-regulates survivin-2B and that forced expression of survivin-2B sensitizes cells to taxol-induced cell growth inhibition and cell death, while silencing of endogenous survivin-2B transcripts by survivin-2B-specific siRNA made cells resistant to taxol treatment. These findings advance our current knowledge about survivin-2B and may help to develop novel approaches for cancer treatment. It has been previously shown that both survivin and the survivin splice variant survivin-2B are localized in mitochondria. Whereas the mechanism involved in blockade of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by survivin has been extensively studied, the role of survivin-2B in regulation of apoptosis has not been well defined. In the present study, we report that in addition to mitochondria, survivin-2B is also localized in the microtubule organization center (MTOC) and, in contrast to other survivin isoforms (i.e. survivin and survivin-ΔEx3), behaves as a proapoptotic molecule.

These findings advance our current knowledge about survivin-2B and may help to develop novel approaches for cancer treatment. Survivin is highly expressed in human cancers but is undetectable in most normal adult tissues, and is functionally involved in both inhibition of apoptosis (1Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J.

Previous studies indicated that there is a mitochondrial pool of survivin, which is essential for the promotion of tumorigenesis through inhibition of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by various cell death inducers (8Dohi T.

Kageyama H. Hashizume K. Kaneko Y. Nakagawara A. Med. Pediatr. Oncol. 2000; 35: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that the expression of survivin-2B is predominant in some benign neuroblastomas, whereas its expression in most malignant tissues is very low. In renal cell carcinomas, unlike survivin and its splice variant survivin-ΔEx3, which show no significant changes during tumor progression, survivin-2B expression is significantly decreased in late stage tumors (13Mahotka C. Krieg T. Krieg A. Wenzel M. Suschek C.V. Heydthausen M. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 100: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential inhibitory role of survivin-2B in cancer development. Similarly, in gastric cancer, a significant stage-dependent decrease in survivin-2B expression was observed in disease stages III+IV in comparison with stages I+II, while the expression of survivin and survivin-ΔEx3 remained unchanged (14Krieg A. Mahotka C. Krieg T. Grabsch H. Muller W. Takeno S. Suschek C.V. Heydthausen M. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 86: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, soft tissue sarcomas express both survivin and survivin-ΔEx3, while survivin-2B is undetectable (15Kappler M. Kohler T. Kampf C. Diestelkotter P. Wurl P. Schmitz M. Bartel F. Lautenschlager C. Rieber E.P. Schmidt H. Bache M. Taubert H. Meye A. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 95: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Survivin-2B expression is dominant in benign brain tumors in comparison with malignant tumors of the brain (16Yamada Y. Kuroiwa T. Nakagawa T. Kajimoto Y. Dohi T. Azuma H. Tsuji M. Kami K. Miyatake S. J. Neurosurg. 2003; 99: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and, in lung cancer cells, relatively high level expression of survivin-2B is significantly associated with the patient category of “no relapse and alive” (17Ling X.

Collectively, these observations argue that survivin-2B plays an inhibitory role in cancer development. While our recent data showed that, similar to survivin (8Dohi T. Beltrami E. Wall N.R. Plescia J. Altieri D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), survivin-2B localizes to mitochondria (10Li F. Ling X. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which survivin-2B functions in promotion of apoptosis has not been well defined.In this study, we report that survivin-2B also localizes to the microtubule organization center (MTOC). 2The abbreviations used are:MTOCmicrotubule organization centerAIFapoptosis-inducing factorBIRbaculovirus IAP repeatIAPinhibitor of apoptosisPIpropidium iodideMTT3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein 2The abbreviations used are:MTOCmicrotubule organization centerAIFapoptosis-inducing factorBIRbaculovirus IAP repeatIAPinhibitor of apoptosisPIpropidium iodideMTT3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein Forced expression of survivin-2B blocks tubulin polymerization and induces mitochondria-dependent, caspase 8-independent apoptosis. Survivin-2B down-regulates the expression of the pro-survival factor Bcl-2 and up-regulates the pro-apoptotic factor Bax, while having no effect on the expression of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in mitochondria. We propose that survivin-2B may represent a novel tumor suppressor molecule, and analysis of its regulation and function mechanism may reveal new approaches for cancer treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Reagents—HeLa, HEK293, HCT116, and MCF-7 cells were maintained as previously described (18Ling X. Li F. BioTechniques. 2004; 36 (456-460): 450-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Li F. Ling X. Huang H. Brattain L. Apontes P. Wu J. Binderup L. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Anti-actin, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and 2% gelatin and monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (Clone: TUB 2.1) were purchased from Sigma. MTT was purchased from USB (Cleveland, OH) Anti-survivin (FL-142), anti-γ-tubulin (H-183), and anti-Bcl-2 (N-19) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-EGFP AV. monoclonal antibody (JL-8) was purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Antibodies for cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175), cleaved caspase-9 (Asp330), cleaved caspase-8 (Asp384, 11G10), AIF and Bax were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-Mn SOD antibody was from Stressgen (Victoria, BC, Canada). Alexa Fluor® 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and the Cell Death Detection ELISAPlus Assay kit (for detection of DNA fragmentation) was from Roche Applied Sciences (Indianapolis, IN).Molecular Cloning of Survivin-2B cDNAs—The cDNA for the open reading frame of survivin-2B (625 bp) was obtained by RT-PCR using a primer set of 5′-GGAATTCCATGGGTGCCCCGACGTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGGTACCTCGAGCTAAGACATTGCTAAGGGG C-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3 vector at the EcoRI and XhoI sites. The resulting survivin-2B expression vector was confirmed by sequencing. Subsequently, the survivin-2B cDNA fragment was isolated from the pcDNA3 vector and subcloned into the pEGFPc1 (Clontech) in-frame at the EcoRI and XbaI sites in cis-orientation.Construction of the Recombinant Adenovirus Delivery System for Survivin-2B (Ad-surv-2B)—The adenoviral delivery system for survivin-2B was generated using the AdEasy Adenoviral Vector System (20He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa T.L. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 625 bp DNA fragment for the survivin-2B cDNA was released from pcDNA3-survivin-2B by BamHI and XbaI, and subcloned into the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV at the BglII/XbaI sites to obtain the recombinant shuttle plasmid for survivin-2B (designated as AdTrackCMV-surv-2B). After linearizing with Pme I, AdTrackCMV-surv-2B was transformed into competent AdEasier-1 Escherichia coli derivative cells (BJ5183-AD1, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) which contain the AdEasy-1 backbone plasmid. Homologous recombination between AdTrackCMV-surv-2B and AdEasy-1 in BJ5183-AD1 cells resulted in the production of recombinant adenovirus plasmid, designated as Ad-surv-2B. Recombinant adenovirus particles for survivin-2B were then produced by transfection of the PacI-linearized Ad-surv-2B into HEK293 packaging cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Invitrogen). Recombinant viral particles were then purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation. The concentrated adenovirus particles, with a titer of 1011–12 pfu/ml, were kept at -80 °C for later use.Recombinant Adenovirus Infection of Experimental Cells—HeLa, HCT116, and MCF7 cells were incubated with serial dilutions of recombinant adenovirus particles to determine optimal concentrations for gene expression in each cell type. The infection efficiency was monitored through microscopic observation of fluorescence marker expression in cells.Plasmid Transfection—HeLa or HKE293 cells were transfected with pEGFPc1-survivin-2B or pEGFPc1 empty vector using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blot analysis and flow cytometry, cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA and 2.5 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 in 6-well plates (4 × 105 cells/well). For fluorescence microscopy, cells were transfected with 0.6 μg of plasmid and 1.0 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 in 12-well plates (1–2 × 105 cells/well). For cell apoptosis (DNA fragmentation) assays, cells were transfected with 0.12 μg of plasmids and 0.2 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 in 48-well plates (3 × 104 cells/well) and for MTT cell growth assays, cells were transfected with 60 ng of plasmid and 0.08 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 in 96-well plates (3000 cells/well). Transfection experiments were performed at least in triplicate for each experiment. For double staining of DNA and γ-tubulin, cells were fixed 48 h after transfection with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm KCl).Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed as previously described (21Ling X. Bernacki R.J. Brattain M.G. Li F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15196-15203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) except that cells were lysed in 8 m urea solution. Following protein transfer, the membrane was incubated with antibodies for EGFP (1:1000), survivin-2B (1:2000), Bcl-2 (1:500), AIF (1:1000), Bax (1:1000), or MnSOD (1:10,000). Corresponding protein signals were detected using a HRPL kit (National Diagnostics/LPS, Rochester, NY) by x-ray film exposure with various times (20–120 s).Tubulin Depolymerization and Repolymerization Assays (22Mistry S.J. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31209-31215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)—HeLa cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes (1 × 106 cells/dish) and transfected with EGFP or EGFP-survivin-2B vectors as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with nocodazole (2 μg/ml) for 2 h to depolymerize tubulin. Cells were then released from nocodazole and lysed at 0, 4, 8, and 12 min in 400 μl of microtubule-stabilizing lysis buffer containing 4 μm taxol (paclitaxel), 0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.9, 2 m glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 22 °C for sedimentation of the polymeric tubulin. The sediment (containing the polymerized tubulin) was solubilized in 150 μl of buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.4 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 5 μg of leupeptin. Equal volumes (50 μl) of resulting samples were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-γ-tubulin antibody.MTT Assay and Taxol Treatment—The MTT assay was used to determine the effect of survivin-2B on cell growth/viability with or without taxol treatment. In this assay, MTT was used as a colorimetric substrate for measuring cell viability. Non-viable cells, with altered cellular redox activity, are unable to reduce the dye. Seventy-two hours after transfection (equivalent to 48 h after taxol treatment (adding taxol 24 h after transfection)] of survivin-2B, MTT assays were carried out by adding MTT to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 96-well plates and incubation in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 4 h. The resultant reactions were then dissolved by adding 100 μl per well of a buffer containing 20% SDS, 50% N,N-dimethylformamide (pH 4.7) for an additional 4 h incubation. Absorbance in each well was measured at 570 nm using an Ultra Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Results are reported as a histogram. The bars are the mean ± S.D. derived from six independent measurements for each transfected vector.Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining and Flow Cytometric Analysis—HeLa cells with and without transfection with the pEG-FPc1-survivin-2B expression vector or the pEGFPc1 empty vector were stained with PI and analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described (17Ling X. Yang J. Tan D. Ramnath N. Younis T. Bundy B.N. Slocum H.K. Yang L. Zhou M. Li F. Lung Cancer. 2005; 49: 353-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) by gating the transfected green cells from 10,000 events per sample. Flow cytometric data were analyzed using WinList software (Verity Software House Inc., Topsham, ME). Each condition was performed in triplicate to minimize potential testing system variation. Data were from two independent analyses.Mitotic Index Analysis—Forty-eight hours after transfection (see above), HeLa cells were double stained for DNA and phosphohistone H3 (Ser10), a mitotic marker. Mitotic cells with phosphohistone H3 (Ser10) positivity were identified by fluorescence microscopy and shown as a percentage of total transfected green cells counted from 10 independent microscopic fields in each well. The S.D. was calculated from six independent wells in each group.Fluorescence Microscopy—HeLa or HEK293 cells were seeded on circular glass coverslips coated with 2% gelatin in 12-well plates. For double staining of DNA and β-tubulin, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, blocked/permeabilized with PBS containing 2% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100, and then incubated in PBS containing 1% BSA and anti-γ-tubulin antibody (1:1000) for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated in PBS containing Texas red/anti-mouse IgG antibodies for 45 min at room temperature, followed by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in PBS for 10 min. Coverslips were then mounted on glass slides with Gel/Mount™ solution (Biomedia, Foster City, CA). For Bcl-2 staining, cells were incubated in PBS containing 1% BSA and anti-Bcl-2 antibody (1:500) as above without DAPI staining. In these experiments, cell morphology was visualized and digitally captured using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 m Fluorescence Microscopy System.Survivin-2B-specific siRNA Preparation and Transfection—A designed human survivin-2B mRNA-specific RNA oligonucleotides with 3′-TT overhangs were chemically synthesized and purified by HPLC (GeneLink, Hawthorne, NY): 2B-2f (245CCUGUAAUACCAGCACUUUT263T) and 2B-2r (263AAAGUGCUGGUAUUACAGGT245T). Equal moles of 2B-2f/2B-2r were mixed together to a final concentration of 20 μm in annealing buffer (100 mm KAc, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, 2 mm MgAc2, pH 7.4). After denaturation at 90 °C for 1 min, the mixture was annealed at 37 °C for 60 min and stored at -80 °C for transfection experiments. A scramble RNA duplex was also prepared as above for a negative control in this study. The scramble sequence (5′-CAGUCGCGUUUGCGACUGGTT (forward chain) and 5′-CCAGUCGCAAACGCGACUGTT (reverse chain)) was not present in mammalian cells by BLAST search at NCBI.Cells were transfected with survivin-2B-specific siRNA using Lipofectamine™ 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1 day prior to transfection, 5 × 104 MCF-7 cells (in 2 ml of DMEM medium) per well were seeded in six-well plates (corresponding to a density of 40% at the time of transfection) without antibiotics. The transfection mixture was prepared by mixing 100 μl of DMEM containing 6 μl of 20 μm siRNA with 100 μl of DMEM containing 4 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent. The mixture was added to the 6-well plate after 20–30 min incubation at room temperature. The transfected cells were returned to CO2 incubator. Twenty-four hours after transfection with survivin-2B-specific siRNA or control siRNA as described above, cells were treated with or without taxol at different concentrations. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR), cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection. For MTT assays, cells were transfected with 0.25 μl of control or survivin-2B-specific siRNA and 0.18 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 for each well in 96-well plates (3000 cells per well) and MTT assay was performed 72 h after transfection.Total RNA Isolation and QRT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated 48 h after transfection of survivin-2B-specific and control siRNA using TRI REAGENT following the manufacturer's instruction (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Endogenous survivin-2B transcript expression was detected by QRT-PCR using the one step RT-PCR system as described by the manufacturer (USB, Cleveland, Ohio). Hsv5′P1 (5′-GAGGCTGGCTTCATCCACTG-3′) and 2B-2 (5′-GTTCCTCTCTCGTGATCC G-3′) were used to amplify survivin-2B PCR products (183 bp). GAPDH3 (5′-CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTACA-3′) and GAPDH8 (5′-GGCCATCCACAGTCTTCT G-3′) were used to amplify the GAPDH PCR products (467 bp, internal control). Briefly, one μg of total RNA was added into a 50 μl of total volume containing 12.5 μl RT-PCR Master Mix, 600 nm Hsv5′P1 and 2B-2, 200 nm GAPDH3, and GAPDH8 primers. Reverse transcription was carried out at 50 °C for 25 min; PCR parameters were preheating at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 28 PCR cycles of 94 °C × 30 s, 54 °C × 30 s, and 68 °C × 1 min. A final elongation was at 72 °C for 5 min, and then the PCR reaction was held at 4 °C. PCR reactions were separated on a 2% agarose gel along with a 100-bp DNA marker. PCR products were visualized under ultraviolet light (236 nm) after ethidium bromide staining. Images were obtained using a digital image system.Isolation of Cytoplasmic and Mitochondrial Fractions—HeLa cells were transfected with pEGFPc1-survivin-2B or the pEGFPc1 (control) as described above. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial subcellular fractions were isolated as previously described (23McGuire J.J. Russell C.A. Balinska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13012-13016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Resultant supernatants (cytosolic fraction) and pellets (mitochondrial fraction) were analyzed for survivin-2B expression by Western blot analysis.Determination of Cytosolic versus Mitochondrial Distribution of Smac—Smac distribution was detected using the Titer-Zyme ELA human Smac/DIABLO ELISA kit (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Forty-eight hours after transfection with or without pEGFPc1 (control) or pEGFPc1-survivin-2B, cells were harvested by trypsinization and centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in Digitonin Cell Permeabilization Buffer and incubated on ice for 5 min. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, supernatants were saved as the cytosolic fraction. Remaining pellets were then resuspended with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer Cell Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS and Protease Inhibitor Mixture 0.5 μl/ml), vortexed and incubated on ice for 5 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved as the mitochondrial fraction. Total protein concentrations for the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were detected using Bio-Rad protein detection reagents. From each portion, 2 μg of total protein were diluted in 100 μl of PBS per well for determination of Smac concentration using ELISA. Sample or standard Smac protein was added into the appropriate precoated well and incubated at room temperature on a plate shaker for 1 h at 250 rpm. Smac EIA antibody was added following four PBS washes. After a 1-h incubation and four PBS washes, 100 μl of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added to each well, followed by 30 min of incubation and PBS washing. Substrate solutions were then added to each well, and the plate was then shaken on a plate shaker at 250 rpm for 30 min at room temperature for color development. After adding 100 μl of Stop Solution into each well, the plate was read at 450 nm using an Ultra Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments).Mitochondrial Potential Assays—Forty-eight hours after transfection, mitochondrial potential was determined using the JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential detection kit (Cell Technology). In healthy cells, the JC-1 dye accumulates in the mitochondria and appears bright red by fluorescence microscopy, but, in apoptotic cells, the mitochondrial membrane potential collapses and the JC-1 dye cannot accumulate within the mitochondria (no color).

One of these peptides successfully produced survivin-2B-specific antibodies. Briefly, two pre-immune eggs from each hen were collected before carrying out immunizations. On day 0, 0.02–0.2 mg of antigen (KLH-conjugated peptides) in Freund's Complete Adjuvant was injected subcutaneously and/or intramuscularly into the breast tissue of a hen at multiple sites. Immunizations were repeated on days 21, 35, and 49 using Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant. Immune eggs were collected from day 59. IgY antibodies were then isolated from the yolk of immune eggs and purified by the peptide-conjugated affinity column. This antibody was recently characterized (10Li F. Ling X. J. Cell.

Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ectopic expression of EGFP-survivin-2B decreased G2/M phase cell populations over time (e.g. 18.5%, in pEGFP-survivin-2B-transfected G2/M cells versus 29.2% in pEGFP-transfected G2/M cells at the 48-h time point), accompanied by increased sub-G1 cell populations (dead cells) (Fig. 1A). To further explore whether the survivin-2B-mediated inhibition of G2/M cell populations resulted from the decrease of G2 or mitotic cells, we morphologically examined mitotic cells by phosphohistone H3 (mitotic marker)-labeled fluorescence microscopy and found that increased survivin-2B expression strikingly decreases the population of mitotic cells (Fig. 1B). This indicates that survivin-2B plays a role in blocking cells going into mitosis.Survivin-2B Colocalizes with MTOC and Interacts with γ-Tubulin—To investigate the potential mechanism for survivin-2B-mediated abrogation of mitotic cells, we performed fluorescence microscopy to determine whether survivin-2B is associated with any structures relevant to mitosis.

https://openalex.org/W1969174970,"Type III protein secretion has been shown recently to be important in the virulence of the fish pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida. The ADP-ribosylating toxin Aeromonas exoenzyme T (AexT) is one effector protein targeted for secretion via this system. In this study, we identified muscular and nonmuscular actin as substrates of the ADP-ribosylating activity of AexT. Furthermore, we show that AexT also functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), displaying GAP activity against monomeric GTPases of the Rho family, specifically Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. Transfection of fish cells with wild type AexT resulted in depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell rounding. Point mutations within either the GAP or the ADP-ribosylating active sites of AexT (Arg-143 as well as Glu-398 and Glu-401, respectively) abolished enzymatic activity, yet did not prevent actin filament depolymerization. However, inactivation of the two catalytic sites simultaneously did. These results suggest that both the GAP and ADP-ribosylating domains of AexT contribute to its biological activity. This is the first bacterial virulence factor to be described that has a specific actin ADP-ribosylation activity and GAP activity toward Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, both enzymatic activities contributing to actin filament depolymerization.

Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida (A. salmonicida) is the causative agent of furunculosis, a systemic disease that affects salmonid fish (salmon, trout, and char). A. salmonicida expresses a variety of extracellular toxins, many of which have been implicated in virulence. Several of these factors, including the pore-forming toxin aerolysin, serine protease, and the phospholipase GCAT, are secreted into the environment via the well characterized type II or general secretory pathway (1Wong K.R. Green M.J. Buckley J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2523-2527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jiang B. Howard S.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1351-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, like many Gram-negative pathogens, A. salmonicida also possesses a type III protein secretion system (3Burr S.E. Stuber K. Wahli T. Frey J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5966-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Burr S.E. Wahli T. Segner H. Pugovkin D. Frey J. Dis. Aquat.

Such secretion systems translocate toxins, or type III effector proteins, directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. Here the effector proteins are able to modulate cell signaling pathways or, alternatively, disrupt the dynamics of the cytoskeleton (6Ghosh P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 771-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 7Mota L.J. Cornelis G.R. Ann. Med. 2005; 37: 234-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To date, the following genes encoding four type III effector proteins have been identified in A. salmonicida: aexT, aopP, aopO and aopH (8Braun M. Stuber K. Schlatter Y. Wahli T. Kuhnert P. Frey J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 9Dacanay A. Knickle L. Solanky K.S. Boyd J.M. Walter J.A. Brown L.L. Johnson S.C. Reith M.

Microbiology. 2006; 152: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although functional studies of AopO and AopH have not yet been carried out, sequence homology with type III effector proteins YopO and YopH of Yersinia sp. suggests that AopO and AopH modify the actin cytoskeleton of target eukaryotic cells. In contrast, AopP has been shown to interfere with the NF-κB signaling pathway by inhibiting translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus of target cells (10Fehr D. Casanova C. Liverman A. Blazkova H. Orth K. Dobbelaere D. Frey J. Burr S.E. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). AexT, the first type III effector of A. salmonicida to be characterized, has been shown to function as an ADP-ribosylating toxin (8Braun M. Stuber K. Schlatter Y. Wahli T. Kuhnert P. Frey J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, its substrate has never before been identified. AexT also displays significant sequence homology to the bifunctional type III effector proteins ExoS and ExoT, expressed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both ExoS and ExoT are known ADP-ribosylating toxins (11Barbieri J.T. Sun J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 152: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) but also function as GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) 2The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinWTwild typeEPC cellsepithelioma papulosum cyprinid cellsEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography.

Here we report that AexT is also a bifunctional protein possessing both ADP-ribosylating and GAP activities. We identify actin as the only specific target of the APD-ribosylating activity of AexT, and we show that AexT also exhibits GAP activity against the monomeric GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. Both enzymatic activities are involved in AexT-dependent actin filament depolymerization in eukaryotic cells. Bacterial Strains—Cloning was routinely carried out in Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (14Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-378Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (15Davanloo P. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) was used for the expression of recombinant AexT proteins, and strain S17-1 (16Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5642) Google Scholar) was used as the donor strain in bacterial conjugation. The wild type (WT) isolate A. salmonicida strain JF2267 (8Braun M. Stuber K. Schlatter Y. Wahli T. Kuhnert P. Frey J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) used in this study was routinely cultured on Luria-Bertani agar plates at 18 °C. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The WT aexT gene was amplified from A. salmonicida strain JF2267 by PCR using primers aexTHIS-forward and aexTHIS-reverse (Table 1) or aexTGFP-forward and aexTGFP-reverse (Table 1) before being cloned into the vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis via the overlap extension-PCR method (17Braman J. Papworth C. Greener A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar) was then carried out using mutagenesis primers as indicated in Table 1. Resulting PCR products were digested with DpnI to eliminate the methylated (parental) DNA (18Nelson M. Mcclelland M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 279-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and subsequently used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue.

Open table in a new tab Overexpression of AexT and AexT Mutants—Vector pETHIS-1, containing either WT or mutated aexT genes, was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for expression. Induction and subsequent purification of recombinant proteins were performed as described previously (19Belloy L. Vilei E.M. Giacometti M. Frey J. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation Assay—In vitro ADP-ribosylation assays were carried out in 50 mm triethanolamine buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm thymidine, and 5 × 105 cpm [32P]NAD (specific activity 800 Ci mmol-1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Lysates of EPC or Vero cells (20 μg), muscular or nonmuscular actin (1 or 4.5 μg), Rho-GST or Rac-GST fusion proteins (1 μg), and recombinant WT AexT (10 μm) were added to a total volume of 20 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and processed by autoradiography. Kinetic analysis was carried out as described previously (20Marvaud J.C. Stiles B.G. Chenal A. Gillet D. Gibert M. Smith L.A. Popoff M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43659-43666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using 0.5 μm AexT. NAD concentrations were 5, 3.3, 1, 0.33, 0.1, and 0.03 μm. ADP-ribosylating activity constants (Vmax and Km) were determined using Lineweaver-Burk plots. Determination of ADP-ribosylating activity of iota toxin from Clostridium perfringens was included for comparison. Peptide Analysis by HPLC, Sequencing, and Mass Spectrometry—Nonmuscular actin (6 μg) was incubated with AexT (10 μm) and [32P]NAD (1 μm) or cold NAD (10 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. The actin was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Amido Black. Actin bands were cut from the gel, washed with distilled H2O, dried, and suspended in 150 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), containing 0.01% Tween 20 and 0.2 μg of trypsin (Promega). Following 18 h of incubation at 30 °C, the preparations were centrifuged, and supernatants were recovered. Samples were injected onto a DEAE-HPLC column (Interchim Hema Bio 1000 DEAE, 33 × 1 mm) linked to a C18 reverse phase HPLC column (Interchim Uptisphere ODBD, 150 × 1 mm) and eluted with a 2-70% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Radioactive material in fractions from actin ADP-ribosylated with [32P]NAD was screened by blotting 3 μl of each fraction onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzing with a PhosphorImager. Protein sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystem 494 sequencer. Separated peptides (1-2 μl on a gold ProteinChip or H4 ProteinChip array) were identified by their mass using SELDI-TOF-MS (PCS 4000) from Bio-Rad (focus mass = 4000 daltons; laser intensity = 1100 nJ). The matrix (0.8 μl) was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid saturated in 50% acetonitrile, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. GAP Activity Assay—GAP activity was determined as described previously (21Sousa S. Cabanes D. Archambaud C. Colland F. Lemichez E. Popoff M. Boisson-Dupuis S. Gouin E. Lecuit M. Legrain P. Cossart P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The assays were performed three times, each time in duplicate. Immunofluorescent Staining of the Actin Cytoskeleton—Epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using the PolyFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated overnight at 18 °C. Eighteen hours post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and then incubated in 50 mm NH4Cl for 15 min to block free aldehydes remaining after fixation. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma). Stained cells were observed using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope, and images were produced by digital confocal imaging using Open-lab software (Improvision). All transfections were carried out twice, and a minimum of 20 transfected cells was examined for each mutant. Marker Replacement Mutagenesis—The aexT gene and flanking regions were amplified from A. salmonicida strain JF2267 using primers aexTREcoRI and aexTLSacI (Table 1) and cloned into vector pUC19 (Invitrogen). The kanamycin cassette from plasmid pSSVI186 (22Viret J.F. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 325-326PubMed Google Scholar) was excised, and blunt ends were created using S1 nuclease (Promega) before ligation into the ApaI and StuI cut sites (blunt-ended with S1 nuclease) within aexT. The inactivated aexT gene was then cloned into the mobilizable suicide vector pSUP202sac (23Vipond R. Bricknell I.R. Durant E. Bowden T.J. Ellis A.E. Smith M. MacIntyre S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1990-1998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmid, pSUP202sac-aexT::Km was transformed into E. coli S17-1. Conjugation into A. salmonicida strain JF2267 was carried out by filter mating (16Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5642) Google Scholar). Double-crossover mutants were selected for directly by growth on tryptic soy agar containing 15% (w/v) sucrose, 40 μg of kanamycin ml-1, and 20 μg of chloramphenicol ml-1 at 15 °C for 7 days. Chloramphenicol was used to select against the E. coli donor as A. salmonicida strain JF2267 is resistant to this antibiotic. PCR was then used to ensure the correct mutation was present in A. salmonicida. Fish Cell Infections with A. salmonicida—Infection of EPC cells was performed as described previously (24Burr S.E. Stuber K. Frey J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6583-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using a multiplicity of infection of 20:1 (bacteria to fish cells). Two hours post-infection, the cells were photographed under phase-contrast microscopy (Axiovert 100; Zeiss). AexT ADP-ribosylates Cellular Actin—To identify potential targets of the ADP-ribosylating activity for AexT, an in vitro ADP-ribosylating assay was performed using lysates of both EPC cells, a fish cell line derived from carp epithelium, and Vero cells. In each cell line, WT AexT ADP ribosylated only one protein of ∼45 kDa (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3), corresponding to the size of cellular actin (Fig. 1A, lane 1). When the assay was performed using AexT alone, no ADP-ribosylation was detected indicating AexT does not undergo auto-ribosylation (Fig. 1A, lane 5). As a further control, we also carried out this assay using purified actin and iota toxin, a well characterized ADP-ribosylating toxin of C. perfringens that targets all actin isoforms (25Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5147-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Vandekerckhove J. Schering B. Barmann M. Aktories K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The result with this toxin was the expected one (Fig. 1A, lane 4), thereby adding strength to our finding that actin is the substrate of the ADP-ribosylating activity for AexT. To further verify our results, a second assay was performed using both muscular (bovine) and nonmuscular (human platelet) actin. The GTPases Rho and Rac were also included as potential targets as these proteins are ADP-ribosylated by the AexT homologue ExoS of P. aeruginosa and are also the substrate of various other toxins such as exoenyzme C3 of Clostridium botulinum and large clostridial toxins (33Popoff M.R. The Comprehensive Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press/Elsevier, Amsterdam2006: 157-187Google Scholar). The results indicate that AexT exhibits specific ADP-ribosylating activity against actin, with the reaction against nonmuscular actin being significantly stronger than that against muscular actin (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). No AexT-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase activity could be detected against Rho and Rac (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4), although ADP-ribosylation of Rho by C3, which served as a positive control, was detected (Fig. 1B, lane 5). To quantitate the difference seen between ADP-ribosylation of muscular and nonmuscular actin, a kinetic assay was carried out using both targets. The results, shown in Table 2, confirmed our finding that ADP-ribosylating activity of AexT is stronger against nonmuscular actin. A further comparison between AexT and iota toxin indicated that ADP-ribosylating activity of AexT is lower than that of iota toxin for both isoforms of actin tested (Table 2).TABLE 2Maxium velocity (Vmax) and Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) values for AexT and iota toxin using nonmuscular and muscular actin as substratesNonmuscular actinMuscular actinVmaxKmVmaxKmμmμmAexT2.526.70aThe enzymatic activity was detected but was too low to be quantitated.aThe enzymatic activity was detected but was too low to be quantitated.Iota toxin1.820.901.971.45a The enzymatic activity was detected but was too low to be quantitated. Open table in a new tab In an effort to identify the actin residue or residues that are ADP-ribosylated by AexT, nonmuscular actin was incubated with AexT in the presence of [32P]NAD. Trypsin digestion was then carried out, and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC. Radioactivity was primarily recovered in fraction 51 with lesser amounts recovered in three fractions immediately adjacent (Fig. 2A). This indicated that a specific peptide contained the ADP-ribosylated residue. To obtain a higher yield of actin ADP-ribosylated with AexT, the reaction was then carried out with 10 mm nonradioactive NAD. The peptide profile of actin modified by AexT and non-radioactive NAD was similar to that of unmodified actin; however, peak 51 was slightly enlarged in the actin ADP-ribosylated by AexT (data not shown). Peaks 51 from both ADP-ribosylated and unmodified actin were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. Several peptides were identified in both fractions beginning with the sequences FRCPEA, LCY-VAL, and CPEALF. An additional peptide beginning with the sequence TTGIVM was identified only in AexT-treated actin. Mass spectrometry by two different arrays showed that a 4391-Da peptide was present in peak 51 of AexT-treated actin but not in the corresponding peak of the control actin (Fig. 2, B and C). The size of this peptide corresponds to the sequence TTGIVMDSGDGVTHTVPIYEGYALPHAILRLDLAGR (where the underlined R residue is found at position 177) with an oxidized Met and an ADP-ribose and Na+ molecule (4389.33 Da). A small amount of the same peptide with the nonoxidized Met and an ADP-ribose and Na+ molecule (4373.34 Da) was also recovered. Modification of Arg-177 by ADP-ribosylation thereby preventing trypsin cleavage at this residue explains the presence of this peptide in peak 51 from ADP-ribosylated actin but not in the equivalent peak from control actin. Taken together, these results indicate that Arg-177 is mono-ADP-ribosylated by AexT. Glutamic Acid Residues Glu-398 and Glu-401 and Arg-303 Are Involved in ADP-ribosylating Activity of AexT—ADP-ribosylating toxins retain a conserved structure that forms the enzymatic site. This region accommodates a molecule of NAD and possesses a catalytic glutamic acid residue essential for the enzymatic activity (27Masignani V. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. The Comprehensive Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press/Elsevier, Amsterdam2006: 213-244Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The active site of certain toxins, including actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins such as iota toxin, contain not one but two glutamic acid residues whereby both residues are required for the ADP-ribosylation activity (27Masignani V. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. The Comprehensive Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press/Elsevier, Amsterdam2006: 213-244Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 28Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of AexT possesses such a biglutamic acid motif within its C-terminal domain (Fig. 3A) (8Braun M. Stuber K. Schlatter Y. Wahli T. Kuhnert P. Frey J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). According to sequence alignment, the two glutamic acid residues within the motif of AexT are found at positions 401 and 403. To determine the influence of these residues on the ADP-ribosylating activity of AexT, mutants containing glutamic acid to alanine substitutions were generated. The ADP-ribosylating activity of the recombinant mutants was then assayed in vitro using nonmuscular actin as a substrate. A single mutant, whereby the second of the two glutamic acid residues in the ADP-ribosylating domain of AexT was mutated to alanine, AexTE403A, displayed only a slight decrease in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity when compared with the WT protein (Fig. 3B, lane 2). A similar result was obtained with a double mutant whereby both glutamic acid residues were substituted, AexTE401A/E403A (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Examination of the amino acid sequence of AexT surrounding the biglutamic acid site then identified a third glutamic acid upstream of Glu-401 at position 398 (Fig. 3A). Two more AexT mutants, AexTE398A/E403A and AexTE398A/E401A, were therefore constructed. Although AexTE398A/E403A still displayed significant ADP-ribosylating activity (Fig. 3B, lane 4), the activity of mutant AexTE398A/E401A was virtually abolished (Fig. 3B, lane 5). A triple mutant, AexTE398A/E401A/E403A, containing glutamic acid substitutions in all three positions, was also found to possess virtually no ADP-ribosylating activity (Fig. 3B, lane 6). The results indicate that the two catalytic glutamic acids of AexT are Glu-398 and Glu-401. It is interesting to note that these residues are separated by two amino acids, instead of only one as in other ADP-ribosylating toxins possessing a biglutamic motif (Fig. 3A) (27Masignani V. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. The Comprehensive Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press/Elsevier, Amsterdam2006: 213-244Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylating toxins can be divided into two groups according to conserved residues in the catalytic site. The cholera toxin group of ADP-ribosylating toxins, which includes iota toxin and other ADP-ribosylating toxins that target actin, contains a conserved arginine residue that is required to maintain the stability of the active site pocket. In the diphtheria toxin group, a histidine residue rather than an arginine carries out this function (27Masignani V. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. The Comprehensive Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press/Elsevier, Amsterdam2006: 213-244Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of AexT with cholera toxin suggests that Arg-303 or Arg-306 in AexT could be the conserved, functional arginine residue of the cholera toxin group (Fig. 4A). Two AexT mutants, whereby these arginine residues were mutated to alanine, were constructed, and their ADP-ribosylating activity was compared with that of WT AexT. Although the mutant R306A retained full enzymatic activity, AexT carrying the mutation R303A displayed an almost complete loss of ADP-ribosylating activity (Fig. 4B). This result indicates that AexT retains the main features of the cholera-like toxins. AexT Alters the Actin Cytoskeleton and Mutation of the Catalytic ADP-ribosylating Residues Does Not Prevent AexT-dependent Actin Depolymerization—Eukaryotic cell transfections, carried out using aexT constructs cloned in-frame with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and immunofluorescence microscopy were performed to assay the effect of AexT expression on EPC cells. Fluorescence microscopy showed that cells transfected with the pEGFP-N2 vector only displayed a typical morphology and a well defined actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 5A). In contrast, all cells transfected with WT pAexT-EGFP had a rounded appearance and no longer displayed actin stress fibers (Fig. 5B). The AexT-dependent changes in the actin cytoskeleton are reminiscent of the effects induced by actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins. When the mutants AexTE398A/E401A and AexTE398A/E401A/E403A, both of which have significantly reduced ADP-ribosylating activity, were expressed in EPC cells, significant actin depolymerization was still observed in at least 18 of 20 transfected cells examined (90%), resulting in the presence of actin clouds and a rounded cell morphology (Fig. 5, C and D). This indicates that WT AexT induces disruption of actin filaments and cell rounding and that mutations within the ADP-ribosylating site do not prevent this effect. Therefore, an additional activity is likely involved in the actin filament disruption caused by AexT. AexT Exhibits GAP Activity toward GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42—Sequence alignment of AexT with type III effector proteins that are known to act as GAP proteins identified a potential RhoGAP consensus motif (29Fu Y. Galan J.E. Nature. 1999; 401: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) in the N-terminal domain of the protein (Fig. 6A). The RhoGAP motif contains an arginine residue that is known to be essential for efficient catalysis (30Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and in AexT, this residue is found at position 143 (Fig. 6A). The results of an in vitro assay of GTP hydrolysis performed with recombinant WT AexT indicated that almost 100% of the [32P]GTP bound to Rac, Cdc42, and Rho was hydrolyzed following 5 min of incubation at room temperature (Fig. 6, B-D). In each case, the GAP activity of WT AexT was similar to that of RhoGAP, which served as a positive control. In contrast, an AexT mutant whereby the arginine residue at position 143 was substituted with a lysine residue, AexTR143K, showed a marked decrease in GTP hydrolysis. Five min following the addition of this mutant, ∼60% of bound [32P]GTP was hydrolyzed by Rac and Cdc42 (Fig. 6, B and C), and ∼30% was hydrolyzed by Rho (Fig. 6D). Similar results were obtained with the negative control where no GAP protein was present. These results demonstrate that AexT possesses GAP activity toward all three GTPases tested and indicate that the arginine residue found within the RhoGAP consensus motif is required for this activity. Aext-dependent Actin Cytoskeleton Alteration Is Mediated by Both Actin-ADP-ribosylation and GAP Activity toward Rho-GTPases—The effect of the GAP domain of AexT on actin depolymerization in EPC cells was also assayed by cell transfection, using plasmid pEGFP-N2 expressing AexTR143K. After 18 h of incubation, at least 60% of fish cells transfected with this construct displayed an altered actin cytoskeleton and a rounded morphology (Fig. 7A) similar to that seen in cells transfected with WT AexT (Fig. 5B). Following 22 h of incubation, at least 80% of transfected cells displayed these morphological changes. This indicates that, like the loss of ADP-ribosylating activity, loss of GAP activity alone does not prevent actin depolymerization by AexT. Finally, transfection with a quadruple mutant, AexTR143K/E398A/E401A/E403A, whereby the essential residues within the GAP and the ADP-ribosylating domains were mutated, was performed. At least 90% of examined cells transfected wi"

Our previous study showed that expression of the human β-1,4-GalT V gene is regulated by Sp1 (Sato, T., and Furukawa, K. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 39574–39583), and a subsequent study showed that the gene expression is also activated by Ets-1, a product of the oncogene (Sato, T., and Furukawa, K. (2005) Glycoconj. J. 22, 365). Herein we report the mechanism of β-1,4-GalT V gene activation by these transcription factors. The gene expression and promoter activity of β-1,4-GalT V increased when the ets-1 cDNA was transfected into A549 cells, which contain a small amount of Ets-1, but decreased dramatically when the dominant-negative ets-1 cDNA was transfected into HepG2 cells, which contain a large amount of Ets-1. Luciferase assays using deletion constructs of the β-1,4-GalT V gene promoter showed that promoter region –116 to +22 is critical for the transcriptional activation of the gene by Ets-1. Despite the presence of one Ets-1-binding site, which overlapped the Sp1-binding site, electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the region bound preferentially to Sp1 rather than to Ets-1. To solve this problem, we examined the transcriptional regulation of the human Sp1 gene by Ets-1 and found that the gene expression and promoter activity of Sp1 are regulated by Ets-1 in cancer cells. Functional analyses of two Ets-1-binding sites in the Sp1 gene promoter showed that only Ets-1-binding site –413 to –404 is involved in the activation of the gene by Ets-1. These results indicate that Ets-1 enhances expression of the β-1,4-GalT V gene through activation of the Sp1 gene in cancer cells.

The glycosylation of cell-surface proteins changes dramatically upon malignant transformation of cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Kobata A. Ginsburg V. Robbins P.W. Biology of Carbohydrates. 2. 1984: 87-161Google Scholar). Such changes are brought about by the altered expression of glycosyltransferases at the transcriptional and translational levels. For example, increased amounts of highly branched N-linked oligosaccharides containing the Galβ1 → 4GlcNAcβ1 → 6Man structure, which is synthesized by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAcT) 2The abbreviations used are: GlcNAcTN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; β-1,4-GalT,β-1,4-galactosyltransferaseRTreverse transcriptionDNdominant-negativeEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation GA2 (asialo-GM2); GalNAcβ1 → 4Galβ1 → 4Glcβ1-1'ceramideGM2GalNAcβ1 → 4(NeuAcα2 → 3) Galβ1 → 4Glcβ1-1'ceramideGD2GalNAcβ1 → 4(NeuAcα2 → 8NeuAcα2 → 3) Galβ1 → 4Glcβ1-1'ceramideGT2GalNAcβ1 → 4(NeuAcα2 → 8NeuAcα2 → 8NeuAcα2 → 3) Galβ1 → 4Glcβ1-1'ceramide. 2The abbreviations used are: GlcNAcTN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; β-1,4-GalT,β-1,4-galactosyltransferaseRTreverse transcriptionDNdominant-negativeEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation GA2 (asialo-GM2); GalNAcβ1 → 4Galβ1 → 4Glcβ1-1'ceramideGM2GalNAcβ1 → 4(NeuAcα2 → 3) Galβ1 → 4Glcβ1-1'ceramideGD2GalNAcβ1 → 4(NeuAcα2 → 8NeuAcα2 → 3) Galβ1 → 4Glcβ1-1'ceramideGT2GalNAcβ1 → 4(NeuAcα2 → 8NeuAcα2 → 8NeuAcα2 → 3) Galβ1 → 4Glcβ1-1'ceramide.

Segawa K. Endo T. Kobata A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1073-1080PubMed Google Scholar). Mink lung epithelial cells have been shown to acquire a tumorigenic potential when transfected with GlcNAcT V cDNA (7Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Coppolino M. Dedhar S. Dennis J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tumor growth and metastasis of mammary carcinoma cells as induced in GlcNAcT V gene-disrupted mice by the polyoma virus middle T oncogene are suppressed (8Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very important to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of the gene expression of the glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the Galβ1 → 4GlcNAcβ1 → 6Man structure in cancer cells.Seven homologous genes designated β-1,4-GalT I–VII have been isolated by several groups, including us (reviewed in Refs. 9Amado M. Almeida R. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar and 10Furukawa K. Sato T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We isolated the human β-1,4-GalT V cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AB004550) from human breast cancer cells (11Sato T. Furukawa K. Bakker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When β-1,4-GalT V is expressed in Sf9 insect cells with N-linked oligosaccharides terminated predominantly with GlcNAc, the GlcNAc residues are galactosylated by β-1,4-GalT V as revealed by lectin blot analysis (12Guo S. Sato T. Shirane K. Furukawa K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). On the other hand, transfection of the antisense β-1,4-GalT V cDNA into SW480 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells results in the reduced galactosylation of N-linked oligosaccharides (12Guo S. Sato T. Shirane K. Furukawa K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Sato T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39574-39583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). β-1,4-GalT V has been shown to galactosylate preferentially the GlcNAcβ1 → 6Man group to the GlcNAcβ1 → 2Man group using cell lysates as an enzyme source (12Guo S. Sato T. Shirane K. Furukawa K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Shirane K. Sato T. Segawa K. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that β-1,4-GalT V is involved in the biosynthesis of the outer chain moieties of N-linked oligosaccharides. When we examined changes in the expression of the β-1,4-GalT I–VI genes upon malignant transformation of cells, we observed that the expression level of the β-1,4-GalT V gene increased only in the transformed cells (14Shirane K. Sato T. Segawa K. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which also correlated with that of GlcNAcT V in several human cancer cell lines (15Sato T. Shirane K. Kido M. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Quite interestingly, the tumorigenicity of B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells was reduced by the introduction of antisense β-1,4-GalT V cDNA into cells when transplanted subcutaneously into C57B/L6 mice. 3K.

In support of this, the invasion of SHG44 human glioma cells has been shown to be suppressed by transfection with antisense β-1,4-GalT V cDNA (16Jiang J. Chen X. Shen J. Wei Y. Wu T. Yang Y. Wang H.

These findings indicate that the expression of the β-1,4-GalT V gene is associated with the tumorigenic and invasive potentials of cancer cells. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the regulatory mechanism of β-1,4-GalT V gene expression in cancer cells.The expression of the GlcNAcT V gene has been shown to be regulated by Ets family transcription factors, including Ets-1 and Ets-2, in cancer cells (17Kang R.

The Ets family transcription factors, which bind to GGA(A/T) sequences in the promoter and enhancer regions of a number of cellular and viral genes, regulate the expression of genes associated with tumor invasion, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and organ development (reviewed in Refs. 20Dittmer J. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: F1PubMed Google Scholar and 21Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6533-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that the expression of the β-1,4-GalT V gene is regulated by Sp1 (13Sato T. Furukawa K. J. Biol.

Glycoconj. J. 2005; 22: 365Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown how these two transcription factors are involved in the transcriptional activation of the β-1,4-GalT V gene. In this study, we address the regulatory mechanism of the β-1,4-GalT V gene in cancer cells with Sp1 and Ets-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures-A549 human lung carcinoma cells and HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown at 37 °C in a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1, v/v) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 1.0 mg/ml glucose.Plasmids-The human ets-1 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR as described previously (12Guo S. Sato T. Shirane K. Furukawa K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, a total RNA preparation was obtained from SH-SY5Y cells with an RNeasy total RNA system (Qiagen Inc., Hilden. Germany), from which single-strand cDNAs were prepared using a hexadeoxyribonucleotide mixture (oligo(dN)6, TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) as a primer and Ready-To-Go™ You-Prime First-Strand Beads (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA encoding the full-length coding sequence of the human ets-1 gene was amplified by PCR (95 °C for 10 min; 40 cycles at 94 °C for 0.5 min, 60 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min; and at 72 °C for 15 min) with AmpliTaq Gold™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the single-strand cDNAs as templates and 5′- and 3′-primers specific to the ets-1 gene. The following 5′- and 3′-primer pairs were designed based on the sequence of the human ets-1 gene (GenBank™ accession number J04101) (22Watson D.K. McWilliams M.J. Lapis P. Lautenberger J.A.

For amplification of the cDNA encoding dominant-negative (DN) Ets-1, which contains a DNA-binding domain corresponding to amino acids 306–441 but lacks a transcriptional activation domain (see Fig. 2), TSET-5 (5′-GGGGTACCATGGACTATGTGCGGGACCGTG-3′) and TSET-2 were used for PCR. TSET-5 was designed to contain an initiation codon for the appropriate translation of DN-Ets-1. The newly synthesized KpnI and ApaI sites in the primers are underlined. PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and sequenced. Plasmids containing ets-1 and DN-ets-1 cDNAs were digested separately with KpnI and ApaI, and the fragment was ligated into the KpnI-ApaI site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA/ets-1 and the pcDNA/DN-ets-1, respectively.The promoter region of the human Sp1 gene was amplified by PCR. In brief, genomic DNA was prepared from K562 human erythroleukemic cells using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen Inc.). The 5′-flanking region (–480 to –2 relative to the transcriptional start site) of the Sp1 gene, which contains two Ets-1-binding sites, was amplified by PCR (98 °C for 10 s and 40 cycles at 60 °C for 0.5 min and 72 °C for 1 min) using Ex Taq™ (TaKaRa), the genomic DNA as a template, and 5′- and 3′-primers specific to the Sp1 gene. The following 5′- and 3′-primer pairs were designed from the 5′-flanking sequence of the human Sp1 gene (GenBank™ accession number AF261690) (23Nicolas M. Noe V. Jensen K.B. Ciudad C.J. J. Biol.

The newly synthesized SacI and NheI sites in the primers are underlined. The PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy, and the sequence was verified. The fragment was digested with SacI and NheI and then ligated into the SacI-NheI sites of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega Corp.) to generate pGL-Sp1(–480/–2). Plasmids pGL-Sp1mET1, pGL-Sp1mET2, and pGL-Sp1mET3 containing mutations in the Ets-1-binding sites were constructed using pGL-Sp1(–480/–2) as a template with a GeneEditor in vivo site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations in the Ets-1-binding sites are underlined in nucleotides –413 to –404 (CCCCCATTCT instead of the wild type, CCCGGATTCT) and –291 to –282 (CACTTGGTGC instead of the wild type, CACTTCCTGC). The correct orientation and sequences of all plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing.Northern Blot and RT-PCR Analyses-One day prior to transfection, the cell lines (2 × 105 cells each) were seeded into 60-mm tissue culture dishes. A549 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA/ets-1 and FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Similarly, HepG2 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA/DN-ets-1 and FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Total RNA preparations were obtained from the cells using an RNeasy total RNA system. Northern blot analysis was performed with a 32P-labeled human ets-1, DN-ets-1, β-1,4-GalT V, or Sp1 cDNA fragment as described previously (11Sato T. Furukawa K. Bakker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The gene expression levels of Sp1 were analyzed by RT-PCR (60 °C for 30 min; 94 °C for 2 min; 24, 26 and 28 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min and 60 °C for 1.5 min; and 60 °C for 7 min) using the total RNA (1 μg each) and oligonucleotide primers specific to the Sp1 gene (TS127, 5′-GCAGCAGCAACACCACTCTCACACC-3′; and TS128, 5′-GTCTTGCCATACACTTTCCCACAGC-3′) as described previously (15Sato T.

The band intensity was quantified with NIH ImageJ analysis software (Version 1.37v).Luciferase Assay-To assay the promoter activity of the β-1,4-GalT V gene, a 2.3-kb genomic fragment containing the 5′-region of the human β-1,4-GalT V gene was isolated from a human placenta genomic library (13Sato T. Furukawa K. J. Biol.

The unaltered plasmid (pGL3-Basic) was used as a promoterless control, and the plasmid pRL-TK (Promega Corp.), which contains the Renilla luciferase gene driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, was used as a normalization control to correct for variable transfection efficiencies. One day prior to transfection, 1 × 105 cells from each cell line were seeded into 35-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected with 1 μgofthe reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of pRL-TK, and FuGENE 6. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer, and subjected to freeze-thaw lysis. The firefly or Renilla luciferase activity was determined as described previously (13Sato T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39574-39583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The results show the means ± S.E. of three experiments.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)-EMSAs were performed according to the instructions for the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) as described previously (13Sato T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39574-39583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, a nuclear extract was prepared from SH-SY5Y cells with NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) containing multiple protease inhibitors according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following oligonucleotides were used for EMSAs: probe –83/–58, 5′-CTGGCCCCGCCTCCCGCGCGTGCGCC-3′; Ets-1 consensus, 5′-CTGATCTCGAGCAGGAAGTTCGAATG-3′; and Sp1 consensus, 5′-CCTTGGTGGGGGCGGGGCCTAAGCTG-3′. The synthesized oligonucleotides were 3′-end-labeled with biotin-N4-CTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase according to the instructions for the biotin 3′-end DNA labeling kit (Pierce), and the biotinylated complementary oligonucleotides were then annealed to generate the double-stranded oligonucleotides as probes. The binding reaction was performed by preincubating 4 μg of nuclear extract with 50 ng of poly(dI-dC) in buffer solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at room temperature. Approximately 30–50 fmol of probe was added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were separated from the free probes by electrophoresis on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and then electrophoretically transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). To detect DNA-protein complexes, the membranes were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and then visualized with LightShift luminol/enhancer solution and LightShift stable peroxide solution (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For competition analyses, unlabeled Ets-1 or Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides were added at 100-fold molar excess prior to addition of the biotinylated probes. To identify the transcription factor comprising the DNA-protein complexes, supershift assay was performed as described previously (13Sato T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39574-39583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay-The following Ets-1 consensus oligonucleotides were used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: oligonucleotide A, 5′-AAGCATATCCCGGATTCTGGTTGGCC-3′; and oligonucleotide B, 5′-CCCATCTTCACTTCCTGCATCCTTCA-3′ (Ets-1-binding sites are underlined). Synthesized oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with biotin maleimide and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the instructions for the 5′-EndTag nucleic acid labeling system (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and the complementary oligonucleotides were then annealed to generate double-stranded oligonucleotides. A 96-well microtiter immunoplate (MaxiSorp, Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) was coated with anti-Ets-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin; and then incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extracts from SH-SY5Y cells, which show significant expression of Ets-1. After extensive washing of the wells with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20, the biotinylated oligonucleotides (12.5 pmol) were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. To detect the DNA-protein complexes, the wells were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and then with o-phenylenediamine and hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. For measurement of the background level, the same experiment was conducted except that the nuclear extracts were excluded. The absorbance of each well at 490 nm was determined using an automated microtiter plate spectrophotometer (ImmunoMini NJ-2300, Nalge Nunc International).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay-ChIP assays were performed according to the instructions of Upstate (Temecula, CA). In brief, 1 × 106 SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and then harvested. The collected cells were resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) containing 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The cell lysates were sonicated with four sets of 30-s pulses using a Model UCD-200 ultrasonic generator (Tosho Electronic Corp., Tokyo, Japan) on ice and then centrifuged. The supernatant of the cell lysates was diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) containing 0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Chromatin solutions (1 ml) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2.5 μg of anti-Ets-1 antibody. For negative controls, no antibody or rabbit IgG was utilized for immunoprecipitation. The immune complexes were collected with 30 μl of protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (50% slurry) at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed sequentially for 5 min by rotation with 500 μl of the following buffers: low salt wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl), and LiCl wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) containing 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA). Finally, the beads were washed twice with 500 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA). The immune complexes were eluted by addition of 125 μl of 1% SDS in 0.1 m NaHCO3 to the pelleted beads and then incubated at room temperature for 15 min. This process was repeated, and the eluates were combined. Then, 10 μl of 5 m NaCl was added, and the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 6 h. The remaining proteins were digested with proteinase K and incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. The DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and then ethanol precipitation using 10 μg of glycogen as a carrier. The precipitated DNA was dissolved in 25 μl of TE buffer and analyzed by PCR (40 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min). For amplification of the Sp1 gene promoter (–473 to –179), which harbors two Ets-1-binding sites, TSSP3 (5′-CCTCTCCTATTCCTGCCTAC-3′) and TSSP4 (5′-AGACTCGCTTGCTCTCCAAG-3′) were used. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.RESULTSAnalysis of Putative Binding Sites of Ets-1 in the Promoter Region of the Human β-1,4-GalT V Gene-We cloned the 5′-flanking region of the human β-1,4-GalT V gene from a human genomic library (GenBank™ accession number AB067772) (13Sato T.

To identify the putative binding sites of transcription factors, including Ets-1, a 2.3-kb 5′-flanking region of the human β-1,4-GalT V gene was analyzed using the MatInspector program (26Quandt K.

Because A549 cells have been shown to produce a small amount of Ets-1 among several cancer cell lines (19Ko J.H. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Ekuni A. Kang R. Ikeda Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22941-22948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the cells were used to examine the effect of Ets-1 on the gene expression of β-1,4-GalT V. A549 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA/ets-1 or pcDNA3.1 as a control and cultured for 48 h. The total RNA preparations (20 μg each) from the mock- and ets-1 cDNA-transfected cells were subjected to electrophoresis on a 2.2 m formaldehyde-containing 1.0% agarose gel, stained with EtBr, and visualized using a UV light lamp. The results showed no significant differences in the amounts of 18 S and 28 S rRNAs for either total RNA preparation (Fig. 3A, lower panel). The total RNAs were blotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane by capillary diffusion, and Northern blot analysis was conducted. The results showed significant expression of the ets-1 gene with a molecular size of 1.3 kb in the ets-1 cDNA-transfected cells, whereas no expression of the endogenous ets-1 gene with a molecular size of 6.8 kb was detected in the mock- and ets-1 cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Under the same conditions, the expression of the β-1,4-GalT V gene increased by 4–6-fold in the ets-1 cDNA-transfected cells compared with that in the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3A, middle panel).FIGURE 3Effect of Ets-1 and DN-Ets-1 on the expression of the β-1,4-GalT V gene.

Here we show that the development of such coherence can be monitored using magnetic neutron scattering from a one-dimensional spin chain of an oxide of nickel (Y2BaNiO5), a quantum spin fluid in which no classical static magnetic order is present. In the cleanest samples, the quantum coherence length is 20 nanometers, which is almost an order of magnitude larger than the classical antiferromagnetic correlation length of 3 nanometers. We also demonstrate that the coherence length can be modified by static and thermally activated defects in a quantitatively predictable manner."

When studied in isolation, single WW domains are notably promiscuous and regulatory mechanisms are undoubtedly required to ensure selective interactions. Here, we show that the fourth WW domain (WW4) of Suppressor of Deltex, a modular Nedd4-like protein that down-regulates the Notch receptor, is the primary mediator of a direct interaction with a Notch-PY motif. A natural Trp to Phe substitution in WW4 reduces its affinity for general PY sequences and enhances selective interaction with the Notch-PY motif via compensatory specificity-determining interactions with PY-flanking residues. When WW4 is paired with WW3, domain-domain association, impeding proper folding, competes with Notch-PY binding to WW4. This novel mode of autoinhibition is relieved by binding of another ligand to WW3. Such cooperativity may facilitate the transient regulatory interactions observed in vivo between Su(dx) and Notch in the endocytic pathway. The highly conserved tandem arrangement of WW domains in Nedd4 proteins, and similar arrangements in more diverse proteins, suggests domain-domain communication may be integral to regulation of their associated cellular activities.

The solution structures of paired WW domains for two examples: yeast Prp40 (43Wiesner S. Stier G. Sattler M. Macias M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and Drosophila Su(dx) (44Fedoroff O.Y. Townson S.A. Golovanov A.P. Baron M. Avis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34991-35000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), reveal a rigid α-helical linker in the former case and a flexible linker in the latter. In both examples, the nature of the linker and resultant relative domain orientation has functional implications; Prp40 mediating a bridging interaction and Su(dx) likely undergoing regulated, transient interactions with a number of ligands. The Su(dx) tandem pair is in actual fact poorly structured in its apoform, in part because of a domain-domain association that the flexible linker does not prohibit. Previous NMR data (44Fedoroff O.Y. Townson S.A. Golovanov A.P. Baron M. Avis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34991-35000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) show that both domains attain a folded state upon binding of a PY ligand specific for the first domain. In this study, we further examine the structure and function of the four (paired) tandem WW domains in Su(dx), focusing on their interaction with Notch and revealing unique ligand specificity features. In addition, we address the issue of whether the affinity and specificity of ligand binding by a WW domain located in tandem is influenced by its neighboring WW domain, of potential importance for the co-operative assembly and disassembly of transient regulatory complexes, such as those likely formed by Su(dx). Plasmid Constructs—Plasmids were constructed with pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) as the parent vector to enable expression of the following regions of Su(dx): WW1 (amino acids 352-398), WW2 (amino acids 392-431), WW3 (amino acids 471-514), WW4 (amino acids 515-557), WW1-2 (amino acids 352-438), and WW3-4 (amino acids 474-554). Insertion of a DNA fragment encoding Notch region 2319-2333 (NTGAKQPPSYEDCIK), prepared by annealing complementary synthetic oligonucleotides, into pGEX-6P-1 (BamHI/XhoI sites) enabled expression of the N3 Notch PY peptide. The Su(dx) WW3 (W505F), WW4 (F549W), and WW3-4 (W505F) mutations were performed by Quik-Change (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis. Regions of the Drosophila NOTCH gene encoding fragments, N-PPSY (amino acids 1763-2333) and NΔPPSY (amino acids 1763-2324), were amplified and cloned into the in vitro translation vector, pSPUTK (Stratagene), between ApaI and XmaI, incorporating a stop codon. Protein Sample Preparation—pGEX-6P-1 transformed Escherichia coli BL21 cells were grown at 37 °C until 0.7 A600 at which stage protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.15 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (overnight, 16 °C). Cells were lysed in BugBuster (Novagen) or using a French Press. Protein was affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GS4B) beads (GE Healthcare) in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by cleavage using PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare). For ITC experiments, the cleaved WW domains were dialyzed against ITC buffer overnight. WW4 and Notch peptide (N3) samples for NMR were produced in a similar manner but were further purified by reverse phase chromatography (PepRPC HR 10/10, Pharmacia) with a gradient of 0-40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid before lyophilization and resuspension in NMR buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.75, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm arginine/glutamate mixture, 1 mm EDTA, 5% D2O). To prepare 15N-labeled and 13C-labeled NMR samples, cells were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4 Cl and/or [13C]glucose and induced for 4 h at 30 °C. Typically, 1 liter of culture would yield 10 mg of purified labeled protein/peptide. All WW protein samples were checked for structure (one-dimensional 1H NMR). [35S]Methionine-labeled Notch fragments were in vitro translated using the TnT SP6-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). GST Pull-down Assay—Recombinant GST (control) and GST-WW domain fusion proteins, immobilized on GS4B beads, were equilibrated in interaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ZnCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Concentrations of immobilized proteins were adjusted by dilution with 50% GS4B slurry in interaction buffer to approximately equivalent levels as observed by SDS-PAGE. Immobilized GST or GST fusion protein (45 μl) was mixed and incubated with reticulocyte extract (45 μl) in 1 ml of interaction buffer (4 °C, overnight). The beads were washed 3 times in 1 ml of interaction buffer before analysis by SDS-PAGE with phosphorimaging (Typhoon 9410, GE Healthcare). Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry—Concentrations of recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides N1, N2, and WBP1 (purchased from Pepceuticals Ltd., United Kingdom) were determined spectroscopically, under denaturing conditions, using Trp and/or Tyr UV absorbance. ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC system (MicroCal) at 25 °C with a reference power of 20 μcal/s. Test samples were prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and degassed before use. WW domain protein (15-35 μm) was placed in the 1.4384 ml of sample cell and 1-1.5 mm peptide was titrated in using the automated microsyringe while mixing at 310 rpm. Typically, 1 injection of 2 μl, 4 injections of 5 μl, and 22 injections of 10 μl were performed. These were performed at an injection speed of 0.5 μl/s with 240 s spacing and initial delay of 60 s. The integrated heat data were corrected for effects of heats of dilution and fitted to a theoretical curve using Origin software (MicroCal), with ΔH (enthalpy change in kcal mol-1), Ka (association constant in m-1) as adjustable parameters, and n (number of binding sites per monomer) fixed at 1. Allowing n to float during fitting resulted in varying and unrealistic values due to the shape of the binding curves (characteristic of Kd < [P]), which ill defines n. Where there were potentially two binding sites (for the case of Notch peptide binding to the apo form of WW3-4), the fitting procedure was identical, because fixing n = 1 makes least assumptions about the binding events and results in the most accurate Kd. However, the value will not be absolutely unambiguous. For binding of two peptides sequentially to WW3-4, a two-stage titration was performed. At the end of titration 1, the WW3-4 concentration was recalculated (taking into account to volume of peptide injected) and the sample volume reduced back down to the cell volume (1.4384 ml) as done at the start; by withdrawing protein solution until at the “lip” level of the cell. Titration 2 was then performed. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were carried out at 293 K on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Data were transformed/processed using nmrPipe/nmrDraw (45Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11279) Google Scholar) and CARA (www.nmr.ch) used for backbone and side chain resonance assignments. Two sets of triple resonance experiments were run, one with 13C,15N-labeled WW4 + unlabeled peptide, and, one with 13C,15N-labeled N3 peptide and unlabeled WW4. In each case titrations were performed to ensure that the unlabeled component was sufficiently in excess before beginning triple resonance data collection. Standard experiments were run to allow backbone and side chain assignment. Short NOESY experiments were run to determine the optimum mixing times for the long three-dimensional NOESY experiments (both aliphatic and aromatic). The 15N-NOESY experiments were run with and without 13C decoupling to assist in discriminating intermolecular NOEs from intramolecular NOEs. A subset of the experiments performed on the 13C,15N-labeled WW4 + unlabeled N3 peptide were re-run in 99% D2O. To observe structural changes in 15N-labeled WW3-4 upon sequential titration of peptides WBP1 and N3, 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded at increasing concentrations of peptide, up to a molar ratio of 1:4 (WW3-4: peptide). Two-dimensional 1H-15N TROSY spectra were also recorded. Structure Calculation and Refinement—The protein and peptide sequences were temporarily linked into a single polypeptide chain by an artificial linker sequence (subsequently removed from the final structures). All structural calculations were performed using CYANA (version 2.1) (46Güntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). A semiautomatic NOE assignment approach was adopted in which both unassigned NOESY peak lists (generated using nmrview) and partially assigned peak lists (CARA) were used as input data. TALOS (47Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar) was used to generate a list of 54 dihedral angle restraints, none of which were excluded from the final structure calculation (including four violations). A total of six inter-strand hydrogen bonds were manually input based on D2O solvent exchange data and structural homology to other WW domains. A total of 30 unambiguous upper distance restraints (including 6 protein-peptide contacts) were also manually provided at the start of the structural calculations. The 20 lowest energy structures were selected out of 100 calculated. Each of these 20 structures was individually subjected to energy minimization by the generalized Born solvation model using AMBER (amber.scripps.edu). Non-native N-terminal residues encoded by pGEX vector sequences were assigned and present in the calculated structures but, for simplicity, have been deleted in the structures presented. The data have been deposited to RSCB (PDB code 2JMF; RCSB ID RCSB100015) and BMRB (entry code 15016). Su(dx) WW Domains Interact with a PPSY Motif in the Notch Intracellular Domain—Previously, we observed that GST-Su(dx) WW domain fusion proteins can pull down full-length and extracellularly truncated Notch fragments from Drosophila S2 lysates (5Wilkin M.B. Carbery A.M. Fostier M. Aslam H. Mazaleyrat S.L. Higgs J. Myat A. Evans D.A. Cornell M. Baron M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2237-2244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To determine which of the four WW domains of Su(dx) are involved in an interaction, whether the interaction is direct or via an intermediate, and whether it requires the single intracellular PY motif (a PPSY sequence) in Drosophila Notch, further pull-down analyses were performed. In preliminary screens using seven in vitro translated Notch intracellular domain fragments (supplemental data), all four Su(dx) WW domains (as GST fusions, Fig. 1B) interacted with Notch fragments containing the PPSY sequence (located between the ankyrin repeats and PEST region). Fig. 1C shows the results of pull-downs using one of these Notch fragments (N-PPSY, Fig. 1A), which, although not strictly quantitative, reveal consistently stronger interactions of the individual WW4 domain with the N-PPSY polypeptide than WW1, WW2, or WW3. The WW3-4 tandem domain pair also demonstrates stronger interaction than the WW1-2 pair (because there are two domains present in the paired constructs, it is not straightforward to compare their pull-down results with those of single domains). All interactions were abolished when the experiment was repeated using the NΔPPSY polypeptide (Fig. 1D). Dependence on the PPSY sequence was further confirmed by making the same construct with a Y2328F mutation (creating a PPSF motif), which greatly reduced all interactions (data not shown). The weaker interaction of the WW1-2 tandem pair with the PPSY region was complicated by an additional requirement for the Notch RAM domain, N-terminal to the ankyrin repeats. The nature of this complex interaction will be described elsewhere. WW4 Displays Greatest Affinity and Selectivity for the Notch-PY Sequence—Having identified direct interactions between Su(dx) WW domains and the Notch PY motif, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to obtain quantitative measurements of binding affinity between the domains and Notch peptides containing the motif. The peptide sequences tested are shown in Tables 1 and 2 and representative integrated heat data in Fig. 2. The WW1, WW2, and WW3 domains all interacted with Notch PY motif peptide N1 with a Kd of ∼200 μm, whereas WW4 showed a significantly stronger affinity (Kd, 45 μm) (Table 1). WW4 bound peptides N2 and N3 with equivalent affinity to N1, demonstrating that no more than three residues on either side of the PPSY motif are required to achieve maximal binding.TABLE 1Dissociation constants for Su(dx) WW domain-peptide interactionsPeptide ligandsWW domainWBP1N1N2N3WW1125 ± 10214 ± 3-a-, no data acquired.-WW2116 ± 1199 ± 12--WW3114 ± 6208 ± 22--WW4NBbNB, no observable binding.45 ± 245 ± 344 ± 2WW3 (W505F)NBNB--WW4 (F549W)31 ± 215 ± 1--WW4 (F549A)NBNB--WW3-4 (W505F)NB97 ± 2--a -, no data acquired.b NB, no observable binding.

Open table in a new tab In assessing the binding of Su(dx) WW domains to other PY sequences, in the absence of known in vivo target motifs, we used a WBP1 peptide shown to have high affinity for group I WW domains (48Linn H. Ermekova K.S. Rentschler S. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), in particular for the human Nedd4 protein, WWP1. Using NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy (44Fedoroff O.Y. Townson S.A. Golovanov A.P. Baron M. Avis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34991-35000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the same peptide has been shown to interact with Su(dx) WW3, but not WW4. Using ITC, the WW1, WW2, and WW3 domains showed similar affinities for WBP1 (Kd values 125, 117, and 115 μm, respectively, Table 1). The Kd for binding of this peptide to WW3 differs to that previously reported (44Fedoroff O.Y. Townson S.A. Golovanov A.P. Baron M. Avis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34991-35000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using fluorescence methods, primarily due to different buffer conditions (pH and salt concentration). We note that the reproducibility of ITC experiments was exceptionally good and superior to fluorescence detection. Significantly, in our ITC experiments, as with fluorescence assays, no measurable WW4/WBP1 interaction was detected. The data thus demonstrate that, compared with WW1, WW2, and WW3, the greater affinity of WW4 for the Notch PY motif (also indicated in the pull-down experiments, Fig. 1) is specific to that peptide and is not reflected in its interaction with WBP1. Thus WW4 exhibits greater apparent selectivity than WW1, WW2, or WW3. Given that WW4 has the strongest affinity of all the individual domains for the Notch PPSY sequence, and also possesses the Trp → Phe substitution (Phe549) in a key binding"

Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), a cytokine that plays a significant role in modulating tumorigenesis, normally prevents uncontrolled cell proliferation but paradoxically induces proliferation in H-Ras-transformed cancer cells. Although TC21 activates some pathways that mediate cellular transformation by the classical Ras proteins, the mechanisms through which TC21 induces tumor formation and how TGF-β regulates TC21 transformed cells is not known. To better understand the role of TC21 in cancer progression, we overexpressed an activated G23V mutant of TC21 in a nontumorigenic murine mammary epithelial (EpH4) cell line. Mutant TC21-expressing cells were significantly more oncogenic than cells expressing activated G12V H-Ras both in vivo and in vitro. TC21-induced transformation and proliferation required activation of p38 MAPK, mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase but not Akt/PKB. Transformation by TC21 rendered EpH4 cells insensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β, and the soft agar growth of these cells was increased upon TGF-β stimulation. Despite losing responsiveness to TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, both Smad-dependent and independent pathways remained intact in TC21-transformed cells. Thus, overexpression of active TC21 in EpH4 cells induces tumorigenicity through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, p38 MAPK, and mTOR pathways, and these cells lose their sensitivity to the normal growth inhibitory role of TGF-β.

Ras proteins are signal switch molecules that regulate cell function by cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound conformations. The R-Ras family of Ras-related proteins, including R-Ras, TC21(R-Ras2), and M-Ras(R-Ras3), shares 55% amino acid identity with H-Ras including identical core effector regions (1Ehrhardt A. Ehrhardt G.R. Guo X. Schrader J.W. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 1089-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Aside from H-, K-, and N-Ras, TC21 is the only Ras superfamily member known to transform epithelial and fibroblast cell lines (2Graham S.M. Oldham S.M. Martin C.B. Drugan J.K. Zohn I.E. Campbell S.

TC21 is also up-regulated in oral and esophageal carcinomas, suggesting a correlation between TC21 expression and the early stages of tumorigenesis (7Arora S. Matta A. Shukla N.K. Deo S.V. Ralhan R.

Of these, only PI3K, which phosphorylates phosphoinositides to generate the second messenger lipid phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, is required for TC21-induced tumorigenesis. The serine/threonine kinase, Akt, a key target of phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, is activated by TC21 (2Graham S.M. Oldham S.M. Martin C.B. Drugan J.K. Zohn I.E. Campbell S. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), resulting in increased cell proliferation, transformation, and survival through numerous effectors, including Bad, GSK-3β, and mTOR. Additional targets of phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate include protein kinase C, phospholipase Cγ, and exchange factors for Rac, Rho, and Ras GTPases (10Toker A. Cell Mol.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) regulates numerous processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (11Bierie B. Moses H.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Normal epithelial and differentiated carcinoma cells are generally growth-inhibited by TGF-β, but dedifferentiated or Ras-transformed cells often grow increasingly malignant following TGF-β treatment. TGF-β signals via a heterotetrameric signaling complex comprising the type I and type II TGF-β receptors. Smad2/3 are phosphorylated by the type I receptor and translocate along with Smad4 to the nucleus to activate gene transcription leading to G1/S cell cycle arrest. TGF-β can also activate a number of Smad-independent pathways (12Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3573-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Whereas H-Ras can cooperate with TGF-β to induce proliferation, invasion, and metastasis (13Oft M. Heider K.H. Beug H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Janda E. Lehmann K. Killisch I. Jechlinger M. Herzig M. Downward J. Beug H. Grunert S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether similar interactions occur between TC21 and TGF-β signaling. To examine how TC21 induces tumorigenesis, we transformed a nonmalignant murine breast line (EpH4) with activated H-Ras(G12V) or TC21(G23V) mutants. We demonstrate that G23V TC21 is significantly more oncogenic than G12V H-Ras both in vivo and in vitro and that TC21-induced proliferation and tumorigenesis was due to activation of p38 MAPK, mTOR, and PI3K, but independent of Akt. In contrast to H-Ras, TC21 alters the cellular response to TGF-β from growth arrest to increased proliferation via a Smad-independent pathway. Thus, expression of TC21 is sufficient for cells to lose their responsiveness to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β.

Colony Formation-1 × 104 cells in suspension (DMEM, 10% FBS, 0.3% agar) with TGF-β (5 ng/ml) or inhibitors (10 μm) were overlaid onto a solidified layer of agar (DMEM, 10% FBS, 0.7% agar) in 35-mm dishes. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 9 days. The colonies were scored counting multiple fields using an inverted microscope. Cell Proliferation-3 × 103cells were plated per well in 24-well plates and maintained in DMEM (2% FBS) for 70 h and then pulsed for 2 h with 4 μCi/well [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cells were washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized with 0.2 n NaOH, and radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. Cell counting assays were performed by plating 2.5 × 102 cells (subconfluent) or 3 × 103 cells (confluent) per 35-mm dish and counting the cell number over 5 days using a hemocytometer. Immunoblotting-The cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with either TGF-β in some experiments or 10% FBS in others for the times indicated. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Total cell lysates were run onto 10% SDS gels, then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20). Immunoblotting was performed with primary (1:1000) and secondary (1:5000) antibodies in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 with 5% milk and visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reporter Assays-The cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine with the 3TP-Lux luciferase or CAGA reporter construct in conjunction with a cytomegalovirus-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid. Subsequently the cells were either untreated or treated with TGF-β (5 ng/ml) for 24 h and lysed, and dual luciferase assays were performed as indicated by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI) and measured on a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Ratios of firefly and Renilla luciferase were calculated by normalizing data to relative luminescent units. The PAI/L assay was performed as previously described (17Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Briefly, PAI/L cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium with or without TGF-β (5 ng/ml) or in conditioned serum-free medium collected from TC21/EpH4, H-Ras/EpH4, or LZRS/EpH4 cells. The cells were then lysed, and luciferase assays were performed as described above. Statistical Analysis-Student's t test was used to compare two groups. The values with p ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. The results from colony formation, proliferation, and reporter assays are representative of three independent experiments. (G23V) TC21-transformed EpH4 Cells Are Highly Tumorigenic-Nontumorigenic EpH4 mouse mammary cells were used in this study because they have been well characterized for their response to both H-Ras(G12V) overexpression and TGF-β stimulation (18Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 19Reichmann E. Ball R. Groner B. Friis R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These cells express endogenous H-Ras and TC21 (Fig. 1A) and undergo G1/S cell cycle arrest in response to TGF-β (20Petritsch C. Beug H. Balmain A. Oft M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3093-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). EpH4 cells were infected with either empty LZRS-GFP retroviral vector (LZRS/EpH4), active (G23V) TC21(TC21/EpH4), or active (G12V) H-Ras(H-Ras/EpH4). Cell populations with equal expression of GFP were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (data not shown), and mutant Ras expression levels were verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). To test tumorigenicity in vivo, the cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. TC21/EpH4 cells formed large tumors within 14 days post-injection; H-Ras/EpH4 cells formed very small tumors, whereas LZRS/EpH4 cells were nontumorigenic (Fig. 1B). The differences in tumorigenicity between cell populations in vivo were correlated in vitro by evaluating soft agar colony formation. Within 9 days in culture, TC21/EpH4 cells formed numerous large-sized colonies, whereas H-Ras/EpH4 cells formed very few colonies, and LZRS/EpH4 cells failed to grow (Fig. 1C). Relative cell proliferation rates using [3H]thymidine incorporation, and cell counting assays were performed on the different cell populations. TC21/EpH4 cells proliferated approximately three times faster than H-Ras/EpH4 or LZRS/EpH4 cells (Fig. 1, D and E). Furthermore, when plated at high density, H-Ras/EpH4 and LZRS/EpH4 cells were contact-inhibited, whereas TC21/EpH4 cells continued to grow (Fig. 1F). Thus, TC21/EpH4 cells are significantly more tumorigenic than H-Ras/EpH4 cells both in vivo and in vitro. TC21-induced Soft Agar Growth Requires p38 MAPK and PI3K but Not Akt Activation-Because TC21 is known to activate Erk1/2, p38 MAPK, and PI3K (14Janda E. Lehmann K. Killisch I. Jechlinger M. Herzig M. Downward J. Beug H. Grunert S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 21Kim E.S. Kim M.S. Moon A. Cytokine. 2005; 29: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we investigated the roles of these pathways in TC21-induced transformation of EpH4 cells. Serum-starved TC21/EpH4 cells showed markedly elevated basal levels of phosphorylated Akt and p38 MAPK, but not Erk1/2 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, H-Ras/EpH4 cells showed a slight increase in Akt activity relative to LZRS/EpH4 cells (Fig. 2A). Serum stimulation induced a similar transient increase in p38 MAPK and Erk1/2 activity in LZRS and H-Ras/EpH4 cells, whereas Akt activation was slightly increased in H-Ras/EpH4-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, marked and sustained activation of Akt and p38 MAPK was evident in TC21/EpH4 cells. To determine whether these pathways were required for TC21-induced transformation and proliferation, soft agar and cell proliferation assays were performed in the presence of specific inhibitors for these pathways as well as following gene silencing with siRNA. As shown in Fig. 2B, significant decreases in PI3K(110β), Akt, or p38 MAPK expression was obtained following gene silencing. Inhibition of the Erk1/2 pathway with the MAPK/Erk kinase inhibitors U0126 (Fig. 2C) or PD98059 (data not shown) had no effect on colony formation of either the TC21 or H-Ras/EpH4 cells. In contrast TC21/EpH4 colony formation was decreased 50–60% with PI3K inhibition (LY294002, PI3K siRNA) or p38 MAPK inhibition (SB203580, p38 MAPK siRNA) (Fig. 2C). Combined inhibition of PI3K and p38 MAPK had no additional effect (data not shown). Surprisingly, inhibition of Akt activity by siRNA (Fig. 2C), specific inhibitors (Akt inhibitor II, Akt inhibitor III) (data not shown), or transfection of a dominant-negative Akt construct (pCMV6-AKT-K179M) (data not shown) did not affect TC21/EpH4 colony formation. In H-Ras/EpH4 cells, PI3K inhibition blocked ∼80% of colony formation, and Akt inhibition reduced colony formation by 50% (Fig. 2C), whereas inhibiting p38 MAPK had little effect. The same strategies described above were utilized to determine which pathways played a role in cell proliferation as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. As shown in Fig. 2D, inhibition of PI3K or p38 MAPK reduced TC21/EpH4 cell proliferation by roughly 90%, whereas blocking Akt activity had no effect. The proliferation rates of both H-Ras/EpH4 and LZRS/EpH4 cells were decreased by ∼80% with inhibition of PI3K, Akt, or p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 2D). Inhibition of Erk1/2 activity did not affect the growth of any of the cell populations. Thus, transformation and increased growth of TC21/EpH4 cells is mediated by p38 MAPK and PI3K, but not Akt. TC21 Activates mTOR Signaling-Because TC21-mediated transformation of EpH4 cells was PI3K-dependent but Akt-independent, we investigated whether mTOR played a role in this process, because mTOR is known to act downstream of PI3K/Akt and mediate Ras transformation (22Song K. Wang H. Krebs T.L. Danielpour D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). TC21/EpH4 cells demonstrated a marked increase in phosphorylation of mTOR and its effector p70S6K, both basally and following serum stimulation compared with H-Ras/EpH4 and LZRS/EpH4 cells (Fig. 3A). To determine whether mTOR activation was required for transformation and growth, colony formation and proliferation assays were performed using the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as well as siRNA directed against mTOR. mTOR expression levels were significantly decreased in all the cell populations following gene silencing with siRNA (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of mTOR activity decreased TC21/EpH4 and H-Ras/EpH4 colony formation by 60 and 80%, respectively (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the basal growth of H-Ras/EpH4 and LZRS/EpH4 cells on plastic was not significantly reduced by rapamycin or siRNA directed against mTOR, whereas TC21/EpH4 cell proliferation was decreased by 50–60% (Fig. 3C). These observations suggest a role for mTOR in TC21-induced tumorigenesis. PI3K/mTOR Signaling in TC21/EpH4 Cells-Based on the finding that transformation of EpH4 cells depended on PI3K and mTOR, but not Akt, we investigated whether PI3K and mTOR were signaling through a common pathway. As seen in Fig. 4A, inhibition of either PI3K or mTOR reduced TC21/EpH4 colony formation by ∼50%, whereas inhibition of both PI3K and mTOR abolished colony formation completely. Combined inhibition of PI3K and mTOR also had an additive effect on TC21/EpH4 cell proliferation (Fig. 4B). Because rapamycin virtually abolished all H-Ras/EpH4 colony formation and proliferation, it was not possible to determine an additive effect of these inhibitors. To determine whether mTOR activation was dependent on PI3K, we tested whether the inhibitors indicated above could block activation of Akt or mTOR by serum stimulation (Fig. 4C). Akt phosphorylation was unaffected by rapamycin treatment in all cell lines, suggesting that PI3K is not dependent or downstream of mTOR activity. Phosphorylation of mTOR was slightly decreased by LY294002 in H-Ras/EpH4 and LZRS/EpH4 cells, but not in TC21/EpH4 cells, suggesting that PI3K-independent pathways are predominantly responsible for mTOR activation. mTOR Activation Is Downstream of p38 MAPK-Because p38 MAPK mediates TC21-induced transformation independent of PI3K activity (data not shown), we investigated whether p38 and mTOR were signaling through a common pathway. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), combined inhibition of p38 MAPK and mTOR was no more effective than inhibiting either one alone in reducing TC21/EpH4 colony formation or cell proliferation. The combinatorial effect on H-Ras/EpH4 colony formation could not be tested because rapamycin alone completely blocked growth in soft agar; however, combined inhibition did not decrease H-Ras/EpH4 or LZRS/EpH4 cell proliferation any further. We then examined the effect of these inhibitors on the activation of p38 MAPK or mTOR following serum stimulation (Fig. 5C). The serum-induced phosphorylation of mTOR in TC21/EpH4 cells was blocked by p38 MAPK inhibition, whereas treatment with rapamycin blocked serum-induced mTOR phosphorylation and reduced mTOR activation below basal levels. Combined inhibition of p38 MAPK and mTOR had no additive effect on mTOR phosphorylation, and rapamycin treatment alone did not affect the activation of p38 MAPK. Activation of mTOR was also partially blocked by p38 MAPK inhibition in H-Ras/EpH4 and LZRS/EpH4 cells, but rapamycin alone did not block activation of p38 MAPK. These data suggest that TC21-induced transformation and proliferation is mediated in part by a p38/mTOR-dependent pathway. TGF-β Signaling Is Intact in TC21/EpH4 Cells-Because TGF-β is known to cooperate with H-Ras in promoting colony formation, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (18Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), we examined whether TGF-β signaling could modulate the proliferation and transformation of TC21/EpH4 cells. Interestingly, although TC21/EpH4 cells have a much higher basal level of colony formation than H-Ras/EpH4 and LZRS/EpH4 cells (Fig. 1C), TGF-β stimulation resulted in a bigger percentage increase in colony size (data not shown) and number in the H-Ras/EpH4 cells when compared with TC21/EpH4 cells (Fig. 6A). In contrast, proliferation of H-Ras/EpH4 and LZRS/EpH4 cells on plastic was 30–40% growth-inhibited by TGF-β, whereas TC21/EpH4 cells showed significantly increased proliferation (Fig. 6B). Because TC21/EpH4 cells were unresponsive to TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, the integrity of TGF-β-mediated signaling pathways was determined by reporter assays using the 3TP-Lux reporter containing a TGF-β-inducible promoter and the CAGA reporter of Smad-induced transcriptional activation. As shown in Fig. 6 (C and D), all cell lines showed similar increases in 3TP-Lux and CAGA reporter activity following 24 h of stimulation with TGF-β. In addition, Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation was the same in TC21/EpH4, H-Ras/EpH4, and LZRS/EpH4 cells (Fig. 6E). To determine whether TC21/EpH4 cells produced less active TGF-β than H-Ras/EpH4 or LZRS/EpH4 cells, PAI/L reporter cells were incubated with conditioned media from each cell population, and luciferase activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 6F, luciferase activity induced by conditioned medium from all cell populations was similar. Finally we demonstrate there is no difference in expression of the TGF-β type II receptor in the different cell populations (Fig. 6G). Together, these data suggest that the proliferative effects of TGF-β on TC21/EpH4 cells are mediated through activation of Smad-independent pathways and are not due to alterations in the endogenous production of active TGF-β or changes in expression of the TGF-β type II receptor. TGF-β Augments Smad-independent Signaling Pathways in TC21/EpH4 Cells-Because TGF-β and TC21 can regulate multiple common pathways, including Erk1/2, p38 MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and mTOR (11Bierie B. Moses H.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of TGF-β on these pathways in TC21/EpH4 cells (Fig. 7). Stimulation of LZRS/EpH4 cells with TGF-β induced a transient increase in Akt, p38 MAPK, Erk1/2, and mTOR activity (Fig. 7A). In H-Ras-expressing cells a slightly greater and prolonged activation of Akt, p38 MAPK, and mTOR was seen, whereas TC21/EpH4 cells showed marked and prolonged activation of Akt, p38 MAPK, and mTOR in response to TGF-β. Because TGF-β signaling increased the transforming and proliferative ability of TC21/EpH4 cells and markedly activated Akt, p38 MAPK and mTOR signaling, we determined whether these pathways mediated the effects of TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 7B, inhibiting PI3K, p38 MAPK, or mTOR reduced basal colony formation of TC21/EpH4 cells by roughly 50%, whereas TGF-β-stimulated colony formation was reduced by ∼30% by these inhibitors. Inhibition of Erk1/2 with U0126 did not affect TC21/EpH4 colony formation. In H-Ras/EpH4 cells, inhibition of PI3K or mTOR reduced basal colony formation by roughly 60%, and TGF-β-stimulated colony formation was decreased 70 and 50% by these inhibitors, respectively. Although inhibition of Erk1/2 or p38 MAPK did not affect basal H-Ras/EpH4 colony formation, p38 MAPK inhibition reduced TGF-β-stimulated colony formation by 50%. When the pathways that mediated TGF-β-mediated proliferation in TC21/EpH4 cells were determined using [3H]thymidine incorporation assays, PI3K or p38 MAPK inhibitors reduced basal cell proliferation of TC21/EpH4 cells by 90% and blocked TGF-β-stimulated proliferation by 75% (Fig. 7C). Inhibition of mTOR activity reduced both basal and TGF-β-stimulated proliferation of TC21/EpH4 cells by 50%. Basal cell proliferation of H-Ras/EpH4 and LZRS/EpH4 cells was reduced by more than 90% with PI3K or p38 MAPK inhibition, and proliferation of TGF-β treated cells was reduced by over 95%. Surprisingly, inhibiting mTOR did not have a significant effect on the proliferation of H-Ras/EpH4 or LZRS/EpH4 cells. These results demonstrate that TGF-β augments the already highly activated Akt, p38 MAPK, and mTOR pathways, which are critical for both transformation and proliferation of TC21/EpH4 cells, suggesting that TC21 and TGF-β are signaling through common non-Smad-dependent pathways to promote cell proliferation and transformation. During tumor progression, cells commonly acquire mutations in Ras proteins that result in constitutive activation of proliferative pathways, allowing these cells to override normal growth control mechanisms (23Akhurst R.J. Derynck R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S44PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). TC21 is known to be a powerful oncogene, yet it is not clear how constitutive TC21 activity induces cell proliferation and transformation. We show that TC21/EpH4 cells are significantly more oncogenic than H-Ras/EpH4 cells both in vivo and in vitro and that TC21-induced proliferation and transformation requires PI3K, p38 MAPK, and mTOR activity. Although Smad-dependent and -independent TGF-β signaling pathways remained intact, TC21/EpH4 cells lost their susceptibility to growth inhibition by TGF-β, suggesting that TC21 transformation is sufficient to inhibit the role of TGF-β as a growth suppressor. TC21/EpH4 cells were highly tumorigenic both in vitro and in vivo compared with H-Ras/EpH4 cells. These results contrast with earlier observations where TC21-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts formed the same number of soft agar colonies as H-Ras-transformed cells, despite forming more aggressive tumors in nude mice (3Chan A.M. Miki T. Meyers K.A. Aaronson S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 16: 7558-7562Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and where TC21-transformed MCF10A human epithelial cells formed significantly more colonies than H-Ras-expressing cells, but neither formed tumors in vivo (4Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Gilmer T.M. Burridge K. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 169-176PubMed Google Scholar). The low level of tumorigenicity in H-Ras/EpH4 cells was surprising because others report EpH4 cells transformed with H-Ras(EpRas) form tumors by 5–7 days in BALB/c mice (18Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and 4 weeks in nude mice (14Janda E. Lehmann K. Killisch I. Jechlinger M. Herzig M. Downward J. Beug H. Grunert S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Despite these differences in vivo, both EpRas cells (18Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and H-Ras/EpH4 cells were 30–40% growth-inhibited by TGF-β. The pathways that mediate TC21-induced tumorigenesis are not well established. Our data show that TC21-mediated transformation of EpH4 cells is independent of Erk1/2, which contrasts with data showing that TC21 overexpression in NIH3T3 cells increases Erk1/2 (24Rong R. He Q. Liu Y. Sheikh M.S. Huang Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and Raf activity, which is required for transformation (25Rosario M. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These data in turn contrast with other studies suggesting that TC21 does not activate Erk1/2 directly (2Graham S.M. Oldham S.M. Martin C.B. Drugan J.K. Zohn I.E. Campbell S. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and TC21 can transform NIH3T3 cells independent of Raf (26Graham S.M. Cox A.D. Drivas G. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4108-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A marked increase in basal levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK was noted in TC21/EpH4 cells, which was important in promoting colony formation and cell proliferation. These data are consistent with findings that TC21 can activate p38 MAPK in Cos7 cells (2Graham S.M. Oldham S.M. Martin C.B. Drugan J.K. Zohn I.E. Campbell S. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and p38 MAPK activation is important for TC21-induced ureteric bud cell proliferation (27Pozzi A. Coffa S. Bulus N. Zhu W. Chen D. Chen X. Mernaugh G. Su Y. Cai S. Singh A. Brissova M. Zent R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2046-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The requirement of p38 MAPK but not Erk1/2 for EpH4 cell transformation once again demonstrates the heterogeneity by which TC21 induces its effects in different cell types. Like others, we demonstrate that TC21 activates Akt, and TC21 transformation is PI3K-dependent (24Rong R. He Q. Liu Y. Sheikh M.S. Huang Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, transformation of EpH4 cells was independent of Akt. Although this finding was surprising, TC21-induced migration of murine Schwann cells is dependent on Erk1/2 and PI3K but not Akt activation (6Huang Y. Saez R. Chao L. Santos E. Aaronson S.A. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1255-1260PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of TC21/EpH4 cells with rapamycin reduced cell proliferation and transformation by 50%, suggesting a role for mTOR in these processes. Although mTOR has not previously been associated with TC21 transformation, it does mediate K-Ras-induced alveolar epithelial neoplasia in mice (28Wislez M. Spencer M.L. Izzo J.G. Juroske D.M. Balhara K. Cody D.D. Price R.E. Hittelman W.N. Wistuba I. Kurie J.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3226-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our finding that mTOR mediates TC21 transformation downstream of p38 MAPK and not PI3K/Akt was unexpected. Although current models suggest that mTOR signals both downstream and in parallel with PI3K to converge on common downstream targets (29Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), it is not known whether mTOR is directly activated by p38 MAPK. The molecular mechanisms through which the TGF-β and Ras signaling pathways interact are not well defined. Recent studies suggest constitutive H-Ras activity switches the effect of TGF-β from tumor suppressor to promoter by blocking phosphorylation of the C terminus of Smad3 and inducing phosphorylation of residues in the Smad3 linker region (30Sekimoto G. Matsuzaki K. Yoshida K. Mori S. Murata M. Seki T. Matsui H. Fujisawa J. Okazaki K. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 5090-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A role for Akt and mTOR in suppressing TGF-β-mediated activation of Smad3 has also been suggested (22Song K. Wang H. Krebs T.L. Danielpour D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Smad2/3 phosphorylation and Smad-induced transcriptional activation was not changed in TC21/EpH4 cells, suggesting that the proliferative effect of TGF-β is meditated by activation of Smad-independent pathways. In conclusion we show that activated TC21 causes marked transformation of nontumorigenic mammary cells by activating PI3K and p38 MAPK/mTOR signaling, and these cells are rendered insensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β. Although the prevalence of TC21-induced tumorigenesis in humans is unclear, aberrant TC21 activity has been found in breast, oral, and esophageal carcinomas (4Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Gilmer T.M. Burridge K. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 169-176PubMed Google Scholar, 7Arora S. Matta A. Shukla N.K. Deo S.V. Ralhan R. Mol.

Oncology. 2005; 69: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and there is genetic evidence that nonmutated TC21 is a frequent target for tumorigenic activation by retroviruses (31Kim R. Trubetskoy A. Suzuki T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Lenz J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2056-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, identifying the effectors and pathways activated by this Ras superfamily member may provide insights into the pathogenesis of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2168682828,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe visual impairment in the elderly in developed countries. AMD patients have elevated levels of iron within the retinal pigment epithelia (RPE), which may lead to oxidative damage to mitochondria, disruption of retinal metabolism, and vision impairment or loss. As a possible model for iron-induced AMD, we investigated the effects of excess iron in cultured human fetal RPE cells on oxidant levels and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) function and tested for protection by N-tert-butyl hydroxylamine (NtBHA), a known mitochondrial antioxidant. RPE exposure to ferric ammonium citrate resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in intracellular iron, which increased oxidant production and decreased glutathione (GSH) levels and mitochondrial complex IV activity. NtBHA addition to iron-overloaded RPE cells led to a reduction of intracellular iron content, oxidative stress, and partial restoration of complex IV activity and GSH content. NtBHA might be useful in AMD due to its potential to reduce oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and age-related iron accumulation, which may damage normal RPE function and lead to loss of vision."

In this study, we found that the transactivator of transcription protein of Jembrana disease virus (Jtat) bound tubulin and microtubules both in cells and in the purified system. Microtubule co-sedimentation and co-localization assays revealed a robust interaction of Jtat with microtubules. Tubulin turbidity assay further showed that Jtat promoted tubulin polymerization <i>in vitro</i> in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, Jtat promoted the partitioning of cellular tubulin toward the polymeric form, increased the level of tubulin acetylation, and significantly enhanced the cold stability of cellular microtubules. In addition, Jtat-mediated disruption of microtubule dynamics induced the release of Bim from microtubules, leading to profound apoptosis. These results not only identify Jtat as an important viral regulator of microtubule dynamics but also indicate that Jtat-induced apoptosis might contribute to Jembrana disease pathogenesis."
