Using sequencing-by-synthesis technology we directly sequenced the cytosine methylome (methylC-seq), transcriptome (mRNA-seq), and small RNA transcriptome (smRNA-seq) to generate highly integrated epigenome maps for wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and mutants defective in DNA methyltransferase or demethylase activity. At single-base resolution we discovered extensive, previously undetected DNA methylation, identified the context and level of methylation at each site, and observed local sequence effects upon methylation state. Deep sequencing of smRNAs revealed a direct relationship between the location of smRNAs and DNA methylation, perturbation of smRNA biogenesis upon loss of CpG DNA methylation, and a tendency for smRNAs to direct strand-specific DNA methylation in regions of RNA-DNA homology. Finally, strand-specific mRNA-seq revealed altered transcript abundance of hundreds of genes, transposons, and unannotated intergenic transcripts upon modification of the DNA methylation state."

We report on electron transport in quantum dot devices carved entirely from graphene. At large sizes (&gt;100 nanometers), they behave as conventional single-electron transistors, exhibiting periodic Coulomb blockade peaks. For quantum dots smaller than 100 nanometers, the peaks become strongly nonperiodic, indicating a major contribution of quantum confinement. Random peak spacing and its statistics are well described by the theory of chaotic neutrino billiards. Short constrictions of only a few nanometers in width remain conductive and reveal a confinement gap of up to 0.5 electron volt, demonstrating the possibility of molecular-scale electronics based on graphene."
https://openalex.org/W2113649367,"Next-generation sequencing technologies are revolutionizing human genomics, promising to yield draft genomes cheaply and quickly. One such technology has now been used to analyse much of the genetic code of a single individual — who happens to be James D. Watson. The procedure, which involves no cloning of the genomic DNA, makes use of the latest 454 parallel sequencing instrument. The sequence cost less than US$1 million (and a mere two months) to produce, compared to the approximately US$100 million reported for sequencing Craig Venter's genome by traditional methods. Still a major undertaking, but another step towards the goal of 'personalized genomes' and 'personalized medicine'. The DNA sequence of a diploid genome of a single individual, James D. Watson, sequenced to 7.4-fold redundancy in two months using massively parallel sequencing in picolitre-size reaction vessels is reported. The association of genetic variation with disease and drug response, and improvements in nucleic acid technologies, have given great optimism for the impact of ‘genomic medicine’. However, the formidable size of the diploid human genome1, approximately 6 gigabases, has prevented the routine application of sequencing methods to deciphering complete individual human genomes. To realize the full potential of genomics for human health, this limitation must be overcome. Here we report the DNA sequence of a diploid genome of a single individual, James D. Watson, sequenced to 7.4-fold redundancy in two months using massively parallel sequencing in picolitre-size reaction vessels. This sequence was completed in two months at approximately one-hundredth of the cost of traditional capillary electrophoresis methods. Comparison of the sequence to the reference genome led to the identification of 3.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, of which 10,654 cause amino-acid substitution within the coding sequence. In addition, we accurately identified small-scale (2–40,000 base pair (bp)) insertion and deletion polymorphism as well as copy number variation resulting in the large-scale gain and loss of chromosomal segments ranging from 26,000 to 1.5 million base pairs. Overall, these results agree well with recent results of sequencing of a single individual2 by traditional methods. However, in addition to being faster and significantly less expensive, this sequencing technology avoids the arbitrary loss of genomic sequences inherent in random shotgun sequencing by bacterial cloning because it amplifies DNA in a cell-free system. As a result, we further demonstrate the acquisition of novel human sequence, including novel genes not previously identified by traditional genomic sequencing. This is the first genome sequenced by next-generation technologies. Therefore it is a pilot for the future challenges of ‘personalized genome sequencing’."
https://openalex.org/W2156613610,"Multiple lung pathogens such as chemical agents, H5N1 avian flu, or SARS cause high lethality due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Here we report that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mutant mice display natural resistance to acid-induced acute lung injury (ALI). We show that TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6 signaling is a key disease pathway that controls the severity of ALI. The oxidized phospholipid (OxPL) OxPAPC was identified to induce lung injury and cytokine production by lung macrophages via TLR4-TRIF. We observed OxPL production in the lungs of humans and animals infected with SARS, Anthrax, or H5N1. Pulmonary challenge with an inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus rapidly induces ALI and OxPL formation in mice. Loss of TLR4 or TRIF expression protects mice from H5N1-induced ALI. Moreover, deletion of ncf1, which controls ROS production, improves the severity of H5N1-mediated ALI. Our data identify oxidative stress and innate immunity as key lung injury pathways that control the severity of ALI."
https://openalex.org/W1970250905,"Genetics aims to understand the relation between genotype and phenotype. However, because complete deletion of most yeast genes (∼80%) has no obvious phenotypic consequence in rich medium, it is difficult to study their functions. To uncover phenotypes for this nonessential fraction of the genome, we performed 1144 chemical genomic assays on the yeast whole-genome heterozygous and homozygous deletion collections and quantified the growth fitness of each deletion strain in the presence of chemical or environmental stress conditions. We found that 97% of gene deletions exhibited a measurable growth phenotype, suggesting that nearly all genes are essential for optimal growth in at least one condition."
https://openalex.org/W2051423370,"We investigated whether fluoxetine, a widely prescribed medication for treatment of depression, restores neuronal plasticity in the adult visual system of the rat. We found that chronic administration of fluoxetine reinstates ocular dominance plasticity in adulthood and promotes the recovery of visual functions in adult amblyopic animals, as tested electrophysiologically and behaviorally. These effects were accompanied by reduced intracortical inhibition and increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the visual cortex. Cortical administration of diazepam prevented the effects induced by fluoxetine, indicating that the reduction of intracortical inhibition promotes visual cortical plasticity in the adult. Our results suggest a potential clinical application for fluoxetine in amblyopia as well as new mechanisms for the therapeutic effects of antidepressants and for the pathophysiology of mood disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2013205740,"Pluripotent cells can be derived from fibroblasts by ectopic expression of defined transcription factors. A fundamental unresolved question is whether terminally differentiated cells can be reprogrammed to pluripotency. We utilized transgenic and inducible expression of four transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) to reprogram mouse B lymphocytes. These factors were sufficient to convert nonterminally differentiated B cells to a pluripotent state. However, reprogramming of mature B cells required additional interruption with the transcriptional state maintaining B cell identity by either ectopic expression of the myeloid transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-α (C/EBPα) or specific knockdown of the B cell transcription factor Pax5. Multiple iPS lines were clonally derived from both nonfully and fully differentiated B lymphocytes, which gave rise to adult chimeras with germline contribution, and to late-term embryos when injected into tetraploid blastocysts. Our study provides definite proof for the direct nuclear reprogramming of terminally differentiated adult cells to pluripotency.

Our study provides definite proof for the direct nuclear reprogramming of terminally differentiated adult cells to pluripotency. Embryonic development and cellular differentiation are considered unidirectional pathways because cells undergo a progressive loss of developmental potency during cell fate specification (Gurdon, 2006Gurdon J.B. From nuclear transfer to nuclear reprogramming: the reversal of cell differentiation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The success of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) experiments in mammalian species provided proof that the epigenetic state of adult differentiated cells is not fixed but remains pliable for reprogramming by factors present in the oocyte (Byrne et al., 2007Byrne J.A.

However, the inefficiency and ethical concerns associated with attempting to clone human somatic cells have spurred the field to search for alternative methods to achieve nuclear reprogramming (Jaenisch and Young, 2008Jaenisch R. Young R. Stem cells, the molecular circuitry of pluripotency and nuclear reprogramming.Cell. 2008; 132: 567-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). An important breakthrough was achieved by Yamanaka and colleagues who succeeded in directly reprogramming fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by transduction of the four transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K.

Although the initially obtained iPS cells were not normal, several groups have since advanced the direct reprogramming technique by generating iPS cells that are epigenetically and developmentally indistinguishable from embryo derived ES cells (Maherali et al., 2007Maherali N. Sridharan R. Xie W. Utikal J. Eminli S. Arnold K. Stadtfeld M. Yachechko R. Tchieu J.

Moreover, transgenic expression of c-Myc was found to be dispensable for reprogramming though it accelerated and enhanced the efficiency of reprogramming (Nakagawa et al., 2008Nakagawa M. Koyanagi M. Tanabe K. Takahashi K. Ichisaka T. Aoi T. Okita K. Mochiduki Y. Takizawa N. Yamanaka S. Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells without Myc from mouse and human fibroblasts.Nat.

Also, the therapeutic potential of iPS cells was demonstrated in a proof of principle experiment involving transplantation and gene therapy in models of sickle cell anemia and Parkinson's disease (Hanna et al., 2007Hanna J.

Finally, it has been also shown that human iPS cells can be generated by transduction of defined factors into fibroblasts (Park et al., 2008Park I.H. Zhao R. West J.A. Yabuuchi A. Huo H. Ince T.A.

The conversion of somatic cells to a pluripotent state by SCNT or by direct in vitro reprogramming posed a number of mechanistic and technical questions. First, can terminally differentiated cells be reprogrammed to pluripotency with defined factors, or can only less differentiated cells such as somatic stem cells, undergo nuclear reprogramming to pluripotency?

However, as albumin gene expression marks heterogeneous cells populations in the liver in addition to hepatocytes (Matthews et al., 2004Matthews V.B. Rose-John S. Yeoh G.C.

A CD133-expressing murine liver oval cell population with bilineage potential.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2419-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), including oval cells that play an important role in liver regeneration and might serve as adult liver stem cells (Grompe, 2005Grompe M.

USA. 2003; 100: 11881-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), the question of reprogramming terminally differentiated cells remains unresolved. Moreover, it is unclear whether progressive differentiation of the donor cells affects the efficiency of in vitro reprogramming. Development of cells along the B cell lineage allows us to address these questions because sequential intrinsic genetic DNA rearrangements in the heavy and light chain immunoglobulin loci genetically mark the different consecutive stages of B cell maturation (Jung et al., 2006Jung D. Giallourakis C. Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Mechanism and control of V(D)J recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 541-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Cells at the Pro-B stage of development initiate immunoglobulin rearrangements, a process involving the assembly of V (variable), D (diversity) and J (joining) gene segments. Assembly of the heavy chain locus (IgH) precedes that of the light chains loci (IgL) (Jung et al., 2006Jung D. Giallourakis C. Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Mechanism and control of V(D)J recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 541-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In addition, the rearrangements of the IgH locus are sequential with DH to JH joining occurring on both alleles prior to VH to DHJH segment rearrangement (Jung et al., 2006Jung D. Giallourakis C. Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Mechanism and control of V(D)J recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 541-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The productive assembly of VH-DHJH variable gene region indirectly signals differentiation to the next stage in which IgL chains are assembled with Igκ rearrangement generally preceding that of Igλ (Jung et al., 2006Jung D. Giallourakis C. Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Mechanism and control of V(D)J recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 541-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To define the susceptibility of differentiated cells to nuclear reprogramming we used cells from this highly ordered developmental pathway that carry distinct, sequentially acquired genetic “fingerprints” that would allow accurate retrospective assessment of the developmental stage of the donor B cell nucleus that was able to generate the respective monoclonal iPS line. In this study, we have generated iPS cells from pro and pre- B cells by transduction with the reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4 and from mature B cells by the additional overexpression of C/EBPα or specific knockdown of the Pax5 transcription factor. We show that the reprogrammed cells carried the genetic rearrangements characteristic of donor nonterminally differentiated and mature terminally differentiated B cells and were able to generate adult chimeric mice and contribute to germline. Our results indicate that specific combinations of reprogramming factors can reset the genome of terminally differentiated cells to a pluripotent state. Our initial strategy was to determine whether Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc transcription factors, which were shown to be sufficient to reprogram mouse and human fibroblast cultures (Meissner et al., 2007Meissner A.

In vitro reprogramming of fibroblasts into a pluripotent ES-cell-like state.Nature. 2007; 448: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar), were capable of reprogramming cells of the B cell lineage. Because of the relatively low infectivity of mouse lymphocytes with viruses, we established a system that allowed inducible transgenic expression of the four reprogramming factors in B cells. To this end, we have recently shown that doxycycline-inducible (Dox) lentiviral vectors encoding the Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4 transcription factors are able to reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into stable iPS cells that maintain their pluripotency after Dox withdrawal (Brambrink et al., 2008Brambrink T. Foreman R. Welstead G.G. Lengner C.J. Wernig M. Suh H. Jaenisch R. Sequential expression of pluripotency markers during direct reprogramming of mouse somatic cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 151-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). When injected into blastocysts these cells were capable of generating postnatal chimeras which contain clonal populations of somatic cells carrying the identical proviral copies that generated the “primary” iPS cells (M.W., unpublished data). We reasoned that B cells derived from these chimeras, when exposed to Dox, might activate the proviral copies that induced the primary iPS cells and thus might facilitate reprogramming and the generation of “secondary” iPS cells (Figure 1A). MEFs carrying a constitutively expressed reverse tetracycline trans-activator driven by the ROSA26 promoter (R26-M2rtTA) and a knock-in of GFP into the endogenous Nanog locus (Nanog-GFP) were infected with the Dox-inducible lentiviral vectors encoding Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4 genes (Brambrink et al., 2008Brambrink T. Foreman R. Welstead G.G. Lengner C.J. Wernig M. Suh H. Jaenisch R. Sequential expression of pluripotency markers during direct reprogramming of mouse somatic cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 151-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Colonies appearing after 12 days of Dox treatment (Figure 1B) were picked and propagated without Dox to establish Nanog-GFP+ iPS lines (Figure 1C and Figure S1 available online). The MEF derived primary iPS cells were injected into blastocysts to generate embryonic and adult chimeras (Figure 1D). Pro-B and Pre-B cells were isolated from the bone marrow and mature IgM+IgD+ B cells were purified from the spleen of 8 week old adult chimeric mice and grown in media supplemented with hematopoietic cytokines and Dox for 7 days. Chimeras derived from the MEF-iPS-#1 cell line were chosen for further study as donor B cells from chimeras induced high expression levels of the 4 factors in the presence of Dox (Figure 1E). Initial attempts failed to reprogram bone marrow derived B cells and spleen B cells that had been cultured on irradiated feeder cells in ES media supplemented with LIF and Dox as the cells died within five days in culture (data not shown). We reasoned that addition of cytokines might be necessary to allow for an initial proliferation of the B cells that would ensure a sufficient number of cell divisions necessary to initiate epigenetic reprogramming by expression of the four factors. Therefore, we optimized culture conditions that would support immature and mature B cell growth as well as that of ES cells to ensure viability during the reprogramming process from B to iPS cells. Cells were grown on OP9 bone marrow stromal cells in media supplemented with LIF which is required for ES cell growth, with IL-7, SCF and Flt-3L which support B cell development (Milne et al., 2004Milne C.D. Fleming H.E. Paige C.J. IL-7 does not prevent pro-B/pre-B cell maturation to the immature/sIgM(+) stage.Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2647-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and with IL-4, anti-CD40 and LPS which are important for proliferation of mature B cells (Hayashi et al., 2005Hayashi E.A. Akira S. Nobrega A. Role of TLR in B cell development: signaling through TLR4 promotes B cell maturation and is inhibited by TLR2.J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 6639-6647PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure S2). In initial experiments we detected AP positive colonies in cultures of sorted Pre- and Pro-B cell subsets derived from 8 week old adult chimera bone marrow after 14 days of Dox treatment (Figure 2A). Small flat colonies appeared 3 days after Dox induction that subsequently underwent robust expansion (Figure 2B). Around day 11 after Dox induction smooth ES-like small colonies embedded within the granulated large colonies were observed which became Nanog-GFP+ at day 14 (Figure 2B). Colonies were picked 14 days after Dox induction from 3 independent experiments and grown on MEF feeders in ES media without Dox. Within 3 passages over 90% of the picked colonies grew into homogenous ES-like Nanog-GFP+ iPS cells. In the following we will refer to these cell lines as “iB-iPS” cells (for iPS cells derived from “immature” non-fully differentiated B cells including Pre and Pro B cells). Genomic DNA harvested from established iB-iPS cell lines was analyzed by PCR for heavy and light chain rearrangements. Representative cell lines reprogrammed from the B220+c-Kit+ Pro-B cell subpopulation showed that some iPS lines carried DH-JH rearrangements (lines #1,2,7, and 9) whereas others did not show evidence for any IgH rearrangements (lines #3,4, and 6) (Figure 2C), as would be expected for rearrangements in the donor B cell subset at the Pro B cell stage of development. Cell lines established from the adult bone marrow derived B220+CD25+ Pre-B cells carried at least one VH-DJH rearrangement and an additional DH-JH or VH-DJH rearrangement (lines #5 and 8) (Figure 2C), both genetic rearrangements of the IgH locus typically observed in such B cell populations (Jung et al., 2006Jung D. Giallourakis C. Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Mechanism and control of V(D)J recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 541-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Rearrangements were verified by Southern blot analysis (Figure S3). For subsequent analysis, we focused on cell lines that contained genetic evidence for IgH rearrangements, as only those can be definitively traced to cells committed to the B cell lineage. All iB-iPS cell lines stained positive for the ES markers AP, SSEA1 and Oct4 and generated differentiated teratomas (Figures 2D and S4). Furthermore, we obtained adult chimeras from several iB-iPS cell lines (Figure 2E and Table S1). Representative Southern blots of tail DNA from an iB-iPS#8 cell line derived chimera showed an identical heavy chain rearrangement pattern as the donor iB-iPS cell line (Figure 2F), thus confirming that the chimera was derived from the respective iB-iPS cell line and not from contaminating ES or MEF derived iPS cells. A chimera derived from iB-iPS line #9 produced 100% germline transmission (Figures 2G and S5). These results demonstrate that cells committed to the B cell lineage carrying DH-JH or VH-DJH rearrangements, although not fully differentiated as they lack light chain rearrangements, can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent ES-like state by the induction of the 4 transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc. We failed to generate any reprogrammed AP+ colonies from mature spleen B cells or bone marrow derived Igκ+ cells in 3 independent experiments (Figure 2A). This was puzzling given that IgM+IgD+ mature transgenic B cells could be maintained in our culture conditions for up to 6 weeks and continued to express B cell markers (Figure S2). We tested, therefore, the hypothesis that additional pluripotency factors might be needed to achieve reprogramming of mature B cells. Dox induced IgM+IgD+ spleen B cells obtained from adult transgenic chimeras were infected with combinations of retroviruses encoding 20 different pluripotency factors, that were originally generated to screen for fibroblast reprogramming (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S.

Yet, these experiments repeatedly yielded negative results (Figure 3A). As an alternative approach, we aimed to “sensitize” the B cells to respond to Dox dependent 4-factor induction by altering their mature B cell identity. It has been shown that overexpression of the myeloid transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα) is able to reprogram B cells into macrophage-like cells (Xie et al., 2004Xie H. Ye M. Feng R. Graf T. Stepwise reprogramming of B cells into macrophages.Cell. 2004; 117: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) by disrupting the function of Pax5, a transcription factor that is a master regulator of mature B cell development and function (Cobaleda et al., 2007bCobaleda C. Schebesta A. Delogu A. Busslinger M. Pax5: the guardian of B cell identity and function.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We tested, therefore, whether transduction with C/EBPα would facilitate reprogramming of mature B cells. Adult spleen B cells derived from 10 week-old chimeras were transduced with a retrovirus encoding C/EBPα and/or the IL7-Rα subunit and cultured on OP9 cells in the presence of Dox to induce the four factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc. Figure 3A shows that AP positive colonies appeared after 14 days in culture in cells transduced with C/EBPα or with C/EBPα and IL7-Rα but not in cells transduced with IL7-Rα alone. Infection of transgenic B cells with C/EBPα did not result in altering the induction levels of transgenic factors upon treatment with Dox (Figure S6). After 3 days of growth on OP9, small adherent colonies were formed which continued to grow into denser granulated colonies (Figure 3B). Small round ES-like colonies appeared within the large dense granulated colonies, and Nanog-GFP+ foci were readily detected at approximately day 14 (Figures 3B and S7). Colonies isolated at day 14 were passaged on MEF feeder cells without hematopoietic cytokines or Dox and within 3 passages all lines assumed an ES-like morphology and were positive for the Nanog-GFP marker (Figure 3C). Our results suggest that transduction with C/EBPα can sensitize mature B cells to respond to the expression of Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4 and re-express pluripotency markers. We established 120 iPS lines that were picked from independent tissue culture wells containing IgM+IgD+ B cells from adult spleen and lymph nodes at 14 days after Dox addition and C/EBPα transduction, and 9 cell lines were selected for in depth characterization (Lines 1-6 obtained from adult spleen and 7-9 from adult lymph nodes). In the following we will refer to these cell lines as “B-iPS” cells (iPS cells derived from mature “B” cells). Next, we characterized marker expression, DNA methylation and histone marks of the B-iPS cell lines. Immunoflorescence staining showed that all B-iPS cell lines uniformly expressed ES cell markers AP, SSEA1 antigen, Oct4 and were positive for Nanog-GFP (Figure 4A). Gene expression analysis showed that B-iPS and ES cells, but not primary B cells, expressed comparable levels of Nanog, Ecat1, Rex1, Zfp296 and GDF3 genes (Figure 4B). Bisulphite sequencing was performed to determine the methylation status of Oct4 and Nanog gene promoters for iB-iPS and B-iPS cell lines. As expected, fibroblast and B cell control samples displayed extensive methylation at both promoters, whereas B-iPS and iB-iPS lines showed widespread demethylation of these regions similar to that seen in ES cells (Figure 4C). To assess the chromatin state of the cells, chromatin immunopercipitation (ChIP) and real time PCR were performed to quantify ‘active’ histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and ‘repressive’ histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) methylation marks on a selected set of genes known to be bivalent in ES cells (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. et al.A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3738) Google Scholar). The promoter region for the B cell transcription factor gene Pax5 displayed strong enrichment for H3K4me3 methylation in the donor mature B cells, whereas H3K27me3 methylation predominated at the silent genes Zfpm2 and Irx2 (Figure 4D). Conversely, all these genes carry equivalent enrichment for both histone modifications in B-iPS and ES cells, consistent with the notion that these bivalent domains were re-established during reprogramming (Figure 4D). In order to characterize the genomic rearrangements of the Ig loci in the B-iPS cells, genomic DNA from MEF depleted iPS cell lines grown on gelatin was analyzed for IgH, Igκ and Igλ rearrangements by complementary approaches that included Southern blotting, PCR and sequencing of individual PCR fragments (Alt et al., 1981Alt F.

https://openalex.org/W2051666192,"It is well established that high doses of monomeric immunoglobulin G (IgG) purified from pooled human plasma [intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)] confer anti-inflammatory activity in a variety of autoimmune settings. However, exactly how those effects are mediated is not clear because of the heterogeneity of IVIG. Recent studies have demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory activity of IgG is completely dependent on sialylation of the N-linked glycan of the IgG Fc fragment. Here we determine the precise glycan requirements for this anti-inflammatory activity, allowing us to engineer an appropriate IgG1 Fc fragment, and thus generate a fully recombinant, sialylated IgG1 Fc with greatly enhanced potency. This therapeutic molecule precisely defines the biologically active component of IVIG and helps guide development of an IVIG replacement with improved activity and availability."

From the mid-Mesozoic, coccolithophores have been major calcium carbonate producers in the world's oceans, today accounting for about a third of the total marine CaCO3 production. Here, we present laboratory evidence that calcification and net primary production in the coccolithophore species Emiliania huxleyi are significantly increased by high CO2 partial pressures. Field evidence from the deep ocean is consistent with these laboratory conclusions, indicating that over the past 220 years there has been a 40% increase in average coccolith mass. Our findings show that coccolithophores are already responding and will probably continue to respond to rising atmospheric CO2 partial pressures, which has important implications for biogeochemical modeling of future oceans and climate."
https://openalex.org/W2150736048,"Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a molecular signature of most viruses, and triggers inflammatory responses that prevent viral spread. TLR3 ectodomains (ECDs) dimerize on oligonucleotides of at least 40 to 50 base pairs in length, the minimal length required for signal transduction. To establish the molecular basis for ligand binding and signaling, we determined the crystal structure of a complex between two mouse TLR3-ECDs and dsRNA at 3.4 angstrom resolution. Each TLR3-ECD binds dsRNA at two sites located at opposite ends of the TLR3 horseshoe, and an intermolecular contact between the two TLR3-ECD C-terminal domains coordinates and stabilizes the dimer. This juxtaposition could mediate downstream signaling by dimerizing the cytoplasmic Toll interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains. The overall shape of the TLR3-ECD does not change upon binding to dsRNA."

Seed strains generally first reached Oceania, North America, and Europe, and later South America. This evidence suggests that once A (H3N2) viruses leave E-SE Asia, they are unlikely to contribute to long-term viral evolution. If the trends observed during this period are an accurate representation of overall patterns of spread, then the antigenic characteristics of A (H3N2) viruses outside E-SE Asia may be forecast each year based on surveillance within E-SE Asia, with consequent improvements to vaccine strain selection."

The process whereby such a pathway is created through thick, cold ice has not, however, been previously observed. We describe the rapid (&lt;2 hours) drainage of a large supraglacial lake down 980 meters through to the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet initiated by water-driven fracture propagation evolving into moulin flow. Drainage coincided with increased seismicity, transient acceleration, ice-sheet uplift, and horizontal displacement. Subsidence and deceleration occurred over the subsequent 24 hours. The short-lived dynamic response suggests that an efficient drainage system dispersed the meltwater subglacially. The integrated effect of multiple lake drainages could explain the observed net regional summer ice speedup."

For spin-based qubits, this involves performing arbitrary coherent rotations of the spin state on time scales much faster than the spin coherence time. By applying off-resonant, picosecond-scale optical pulses, we demonstrated the coherent rotation of a single electron spin through arbitrary angles up to π radians. We directly observed this spin manipulation using time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy and found that the results are well described by a model that includes the electronnuclear spin interaction. Measurements of the spin rotation as a function of laser detuning and intensity confirmed that the optical Stark effect is the operative mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2001992345,"Canonical Wnt signaling critically regulates cell fate and proliferation in development and disease. Nuclear localization of beta-catenin is indispensable for canonical Wnt signaling; however, the mechanisms governing beta-catenin nuclear localization are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in response to Wnt requires Rac1 activation. The role of Rac1 depends on phosphorylation of beta-catenin at Ser191 and Ser605, which is mediated by JNK2 kinase. Mutations of these residues significantly affect Wnt-induced beta-catenin nuclear accumulation. Genetic ablation of Rac1 in the mouse embryonic limb bud ectoderm disrupts canonical Wnt signaling and phenocopies deletion of beta-catenin in causing severe truncations of the limb. Finally, Rac1 interacts genetically with beta-catenin and Dkk1 in controlling limb outgrowth. Together these results uncover Rac1 activation and subsequent beta-catenin phosphorylation as a hitherto uncharacterized mechanism controlling canonical Wnt signaling and may provide additional targets for therapeutic intervention of this important pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2160718564,"In nearly every organism studied, reduced caloric intake extends life span. In yeast, span extension from dietary restriction is thought to be mediated by the highly conserved, nutrient-responsive target of rapamycin (TOR), protein kinase A (PKA), and Sch9 kinases. These kinases coordinately regulate various cellular processes including stress responses, protein turnover, cell growth, and ribosome biogenesis. Here we show that a specific reduction of 60S ribosomal subunit levels slows aging in yeast. Deletion of genes encoding 60S subunit proteins or processing factors or treatment with a small molecule, which all inhibit 60S subunit biogenesis, are each sufficient to significantly increase replicative life span. One mechanism by which reduced 60S subunit levels leads to life span extension is through induction of Gcn4, a nutrient-responsive transcription factor.

Genetic epistasis analyses suggest that dietary restriction, reduced 60S subunit abundance, and Gcn4 activation extend yeast life span by similar mechanisms. Invertebrate model organisms serve as valuable tools for aging research, largely because of their short lifespans and ease of genetic manipulation. The most commonly used model organisms include fruit flies, nematodes, and yeast. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two models of cellular aging have been developed: replicative and chronological (Kaeberlein, 2006Kaeberlein M. Longevity and aging in the budding yeast.in: Conn P.M. Handbook of models for human aging. Elsevier Press, Boston2006: 109-120Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Replicative lifespan (RLS) is defined as the number of mitotic cycles completed by a mother cell before senescence and may model the aging of mitotically active cells in multicellular organisms (Mortimer and Johnston, 1959Mortimer R.K. Johnston J.R. Life span of individual yeast cells.Nature. 1959; 183: 1751-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Chronological lifespan refers to the length of time that a nondividing yeast cell retains viability during stationary phase and may model the aging of postmitotic cells (Fabrizio and Longo, 2003Fabrizio P. Longo V.D. The chronological life span of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Dietary restriction (DR) increases lifespan and delays the onset of age-associated diseases in a variety of evolutionarily divergent organisms, including mammals (Masoro, 2005Masoro E.J.

Lifespan extension by deletion of TOR1or SCH9 is not additive with DR and is independent of Sir2 protein deacetylase (Kaeberlein et al., 2005bKaeberlein M. Powers 3rd, R.W. Steffen K.K. Westman E.A.

TOR was first identified as a regulator of yeast lifespan through a random screen of 564 yeast strains, each lacking a single nonessential gene (Kaeberlein et al., 2005bKaeberlein M. Powers 3rd, R.W.

Regulation of yeast replicative life span by TOR and Sch9 in response to nutrients.Science. 2005; 310: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Along with TOR1 and SCH9, deletion of several other genes in the TOR signaling pathway were identified to be long lived, including RPL31A and RPL6B (Kaeberlein et al., 2005bKaeberlein M. Powers 3rd, R.W. Steffen K.K. Westman E.A. Hu D. Dang N. Kerr E.O. Kirkland K.T. Fields S. Kennedy B.K. Regulation of yeast replicative life span by TOR and Sch9 in response to nutrients.Science. 2005; 310: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The observation that rpl31aΔ or rpl6bΔ cells are long lived suggests that one mechanism by which DR might slow replicative aging is by decreasing ribosomal protein (RP) production through downregulation of TOR and Sch9 activity. Consistently, several reports have since linked a reduction in RP levels to increased lifespan in both yeast and C. elegans. Deletion of RPL10, RPS6B, or RPS18A,B also increases yeast RLS (Chiocchetti et al., 2007Chiocchetti A. Zhou J. Zhu H. Karl T. Haubenreisser O. Rinnerthaler M. Heeren G. Oender K. Bauer J.

To better understand the relationship between ribosomal proteins and aging, we measured the RLS for each of 107 RP gene deletion strains present in the yeast deletion collection and determined that multiple different 60S RP gene deletions significantly extend RLS. Consistently, we found that decreasing the abundance of 60S ribosomal subunits by deletion of 60S-specific ribosomal processing factors or by treatment with the small molecule diazaborine also leads to increased RLS. Epistasis analyses allowed us to conclude that depletion of 60S subunits extends lifespan by a mechanism similar to DR and independent of Sir2. Finally, we show that the transcription factor Gcn4 is required for full RLS extension in mutants with depleted 60S subunits, demonstrating a novel longevity-promoting function of Gcn4. The yeast ribosome consists of two subunits, the 40S (small) and the 60S (large), which together contain four discrete rRNA species and 78 ribosomal proteins (RPs). In yeast, about 85% of RP genes are present in duplicate copies, allowing for the viable deletion of either paralog, but generally not both paralogs simultaneously. Of the 137 genes encoding RPs, 107 are present as quality-control verified (see Experimental Procedures) deletions in the MATα ORF deletion collection (Winzeler et al., 1999Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. et al.Functional characterization of the S. cerevisiae genome by gene deletion and parallel analysis.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). We measured the RLS for each of these 107 RP single-gene deletion strains, corresponding to 46 RP paralog pairs (e.g., RPL31A and RPL31B) and 15 unpaired RP genes, 3 of which are nonessential single-copy genes and 12 of which have paralogs not represented in the deletion set. Of the 107 RP gene deletion strains analyzed, 28 were found to be significantly long lived relative to experiment-matched wild-type cells (p < 0.05) in the MATα deletion set. To verify these results, we then measured the RLS of the 28 corresponding deletion strains derived from the MATa ORF deletion collection (Figures 1A–1C; Table S1). In total, 14 RP gene deletion strains were verified to be significantly long lived in both the MATα and MATa ORF deletion collections. Based on prior studies (Kaeberlein et al., 2005bKaeberlein M. Powers 3rd, R.W. Steffen K.K. Westman E.A. Hu D. Dang N. Kerr E.O. Kirkland K.T. Fields S. Kennedy B.K. Regulation of yeast replicative life span by TOR and Sch9 in response to nutrients.Science. 2005; 310: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), we would expect a similar analysis of 107 randomly chosen deletion strains to yield 2–3 (2.5) strains with significantly increased RLS; therefore, the percent of verified long-lived RP gene deletions is enriched approximately 5-fold relative to the entire set of nonessential ORFs. Strikingly, all 14 of the verified long-lived RP gene deletion strains lack protein components of the 60S subunit, whereas none of the deletion strains lacking RP genes encoding 40S subunit proteins were verified to be long lived. Some long-lived rplΔ mutations, such as rpl22aΔ and rpp2bΔ, resulted in lifespan extension exceeding 50% (Figures 1A–1C), with longevity comparable to the longest-lived single-gene deletion mutants reported in yeast (Kaeberlein et al., 2005aKaeberlein M.

Not all rplΔ strains were long lived however, and some were short lived (Table S1), for example rpl20aΔ (Figure 2B). These findings indicate that ribosomal proteins of the large subunit (RPLs) are important determinants of longevity in yeast.Figure 2Abundance of 60S Ribosomal Subunits Correlates with RLSShow full caption(A and B) Survival curves for RP paralog gene deletions and experiment-matched wild-type cells.

Linear regressions for RPL (red) and RPS (blue) gene deletions are shown separately. Although multiple RPL gene deletions were long lived, many were not. To characterize this apparent specificity, we further examined paralog pairs for which deletion of one gene significantly increased RLS while deletion of the other did not (Table S1). For example, rpl31aΔ and rpl20bΔ increased RLS, but their corresponding paralog gene deletions did not (Figures 2A and 2B). The protein products encoded by the majority of RPL paralog pairs (26 of 33) are greater than 98% identical, and in the case of Rpl31a and Rpl31b, only a single conservative amino acid change differentiates the paralogs. Thus, it seems unlikely that one of the two paralogous RP proteins has evolved a specialized longevity-modulating function in the cases where rplΔ paralog pairs have divergent RLS phenotypes. Furthermore, we found no correlation between RLS and any other functional role reported for ribosomal proteins (Komili et al., 2007Komili S. Farny N.G. Roth F.P. Silver P.A. Functional specificity among ribosomal proteins regulates gene expression.Cell. 2007; 131: 557-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for divergent RLS phenotypes among paralog pair deletion strains is that one paralog is transcribed at a higher level than the other and thus accounts for a disproportionate amount of the total protein produced from both paralogous genes. To test this possibility, we examined expression of two RPL paralog pairs by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from three independent cultures of the wild-type strain, using paralog-specific primers (Figure 2C; Table S2). In the case of RPL31A, its mRNA transcript is more abundant than that of RPL31B, which is consistent with the longevity of rpl31aΔ cells when compared to rpl31bΔ cells. This correlation does not extend however to the RPL20A/B paralogs, which had nearly equimolar steady-state mRNA levels. Therefore, transcriptional bias among paralog pairs cannot account for divergent RLS phenotypes in every case. In addition to transcriptional control, yeast cells can use a variety of mechanisms to regulate the level of RPs, including mRNA splicing, translation initiation, and turnover of excess protein (Tsay et al., 1988Tsay Y.F. Thompson J.R. Rotenberg M.O. Larkin J.C. Woolford Jr., J.L. Ribosomal protein synthesis is not regulated at the translational level in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: balanced accumulation of ribosomal proteins L16 and rp59 is mediated by turnover of excess protein.Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 664-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Warner et al., 1985Warner J.R. Mitra G. Schwindinger W.F. Studeny M. Fried H.M. Saccharomyces cerevisiae coordinates accumulation of yeast ribosomal proteins by modulating mRNA splicing, translational initiation, and protein turnover.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1512-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To more directly assay whether deletion of one paralog more robustly affects the total amount of protein produced, we analyzed overall polysome profiles because cells limited for a particular RP should display a reduced abundance of the corresponding subunit. Polysome profiles were generated for several rplΔ paralog pairs using high-salt conditions (to disrupt nontranslating 80S monosomes) (Figures 2D, 2E, and S1). In all examples studied, 60S subunit levels and overall polysome profile were more profoundly decreased in the rplΔ paralog with significantly increased RLS. Depressed polysome profiles (Figures 2D and 2E) indicate that translation is reduced in these long-lived mutants. In yeast, a sufficient reduction in translation will slow growth rate. In order to determine whether growth rate among RP deletion strains is a predictor of longevity, we measured the doubling time for each of the 107 rpΔ strains (Table S3) and compared growth rate to the percent change in mean RLS relative to wild-type (Figure 2F). The set of RPL gene deletion strains differed markedly from the set of RPS gene deletions strains with respect to the relationship between growth rate and RLS. For the set of rplΔ strains, growth rate inversely correlated with RLS, while the opposite trend was observed for rpsΔ strains. The growth rate analysis of rpΔ strains is complicated, however, by the strong selection for suppressors of slow growth among RP gene deletion strains in the ORF deletion set. We have observed three different cases where growth rate suppressors are present as spontaneously arising mutations in rplΔ strains from the deletion collection (see Supplemental Data for details). We suspect that the inverse correlation between growth rate and RLS among rplΔ strains would be more highly significant if it were possible to prevent spontaneous mutations suppressing growth rate defects. Regardless, these data suggest that differential lifespan potential among RPL gene deletion strains is related to the abundance of functional 60S subunits as indicated by polysome profile and perhaps overall translation rate. If RLS extension in long-lived rplΔ strains is a result of reduced 60S subunit levels, then mutations in nonribosomal proteins important for 60S maturation might also extend life span. To test this hypothesis, three single-gene deletion strains—nop12Δ, loc1Δ, and ssf1Δ, each of which lacks a factor specifically involved in a different stage of pre-60S subunit maturation—were characterized. Deletion of LOC1 has been previously shown to cause decreased abundance of 60S subunits (Harnpicharnchai et al., 2001Harnpicharnchai P. Jakovljevic J. Horsey E. Miles T. Roman J. Rout M. Meagher D. Imai B. Guo Y. Brame C.J. et al.Composition and functional characterization of yeast 66S ribosome assembly intermediates.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 505-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and a similar depletion of 60S subunits was observed in polysome profiles of ssf1Δ or nop12Δ cells relative to wild-type (Figure 3A). Consistent with our prediction, each of these deletion mutants had an RLS significantly longer than wild-type cells (Figure 3B). In our previously reported screen of 564 random deletion mutants, deletion of either REI1 or YBR266C extended RLS (Kaeberlein et al., 2005bKaeberlein M. Powers 3rd, R.W. Steffen K.K. Westman E.A. Hu D. Dang N. Kerr E.O. Kirkland K.T. Fields S. Kennedy B.K. Regulation of yeast replicative life span by TOR and Sch9 in response to nutrients.Science. 2005; 310: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). These two ORFs are encoded on opposite strands and overlap. It has since been determined that the slow-growth phenotype of both of these mutants is due to loss of Rei1 function and is unrelated to Ybr266c (Figure S3), which is designated dubious and unlikely to encode a functional protein. Rei1 has recently been implicated in late-stage pre-60S processing (Hung and Johnson, 2006Hung N.J. Johnson A.W.

Like nop12Δ, ssf1Δ, and loc1Δ cells, rei1Δ cells have reduced 60S subunits (Figure 3A). Thus, we conclude that nonribosomal mutations which impair 60S maturation can increase RLS in a manner similar to deletion of large subunit RP genes. We next determined whether RLS extension could also be achieved by a pharmacological intervention that depletes 60S subunit levels. Diazaborine is a synthetic antibiotic effective against Gram-negative bacteria (Baldock et al., 1998Baldock C. de Boer G.J. Rafferty J.B. Stuitje A.R. Rice D.W.

On the ice sheet, these data reveal summer speedups (50 to 100%) consistent with, but somewhat larger than, earlier observations. The relative speedup of outlet glaciers, however, is far smaller (&lt;15%). Furthermore, the dominant seasonal influence on Jakobshavn Isbrae's flow is the calving front's annual advance and retreat.

Diet analysis revealed that spiders delivered much of the dietary mercury.

https://openalex.org/W1927245941,"The fractional quantum Hall effect, where plateaus in the Hall resistance at values of h/ν e2 coexist with zeros in the longitudinal resistance, results from electron correlations in two dimensions under a strong magnetic field. (Here h is Planck’s constant, ν the filling factor and e the electron charge.) Current flows along the sample edges and is carried by charged excitations (quasiparticles) whose charge is a fraction of the electron charge. Although earlier research concentrated on odd denominator fractional values of ν, the observation of the even denominator ν = 5/2 state sparked much interest. This state is conjectured to be characterized by quasiparticles of charge e/4, whose statistics are ‘non-abelian’—in other words, interchanging two quasiparticles may modify the state of the system into a different one, rather than just adding a phase as is the case for fermions or bosons. As such, these quasiparticles may be useful for the construction of a topological quantum computer. Here we report data on shot noise generated by partitioning edge currents in the ν = 5/2 state, consistent with the charge of the quasiparticle being e/4, and inconsistent with other possible values, such as e/2 and e. Although this finding does not prove the non-abelian nature of the ν = 5/2 state, it is the first step towards a full understanding of these new fractional charges. A quantum computer relies on 'qubits' (or quantum bits) which can be in a quantum state that implies the qubit is both '0' and '1' at the same time. But for conventional qubit designs, typically based on a single particle such as an electron or photon, these quantum states are vulnerable to disturbances and can be easily lost. There is a hypothetical alternative: the topological qubit, which would hold information as a series of 'braids' formed of two-dimensional quasiparticles. This new form of computing comes a step closer with the publication of compelling evidence for the existence of 'e/4' quasiparticles of the type that could transform topological quantum computers from the hypothetical to the proof-of-principle stage. In a News Feature, Liesbeth Venema explains some of the background to this exciting field. This paper reports data of shot noise generated by the 5/2 fractional state in an ultraclean two-dimensional electron gas that compellingly points in the direction of the e/4 quasiparticles. It is believed that this observation is a first step towards understanding new fractional charges."

The latest outburst occurred in September 2007, within a day of the time predicted by the binary black-hole model and general relativity.

https://openalex.org/W2159993062,"Sequencing DNA from several organisms has revealed that duplication and drift of existing genes have primarily moulded the contents of a given genome. Though the effect of knocking out or overexpressing a particular gene has been studied in many organisms, no study has systematically explored the effect of adding new links in a biological network. To explore network evolvability, we constructed 598 recombinations of promoters (including regulatory regions) with different transcription or σ-factor genes in Escherichia coli, added over a wild-type genetic background. Here we show that ∼95% of new networks are tolerated by the bacteria, that very few alter growth, and that expression level correlates with factor position in the wild-type network hierarchy. Most importantly, we find that certain networks consistently survive over the wild type under various selection pressures. Therefore new links in the network are rarely a barrier for evolution and can even confer a fitness advantage. To understand the forces behind the evolution of gene networks we need to test our ideas by constructing synthetic model systems. Until now most systematic genetic manipulations have involved either the deletion or overexpression of a few individual genes. Now by systematically shuffling promoters and coding regions in Escherichia coli, Isalan et al. have achieved the first large-scale rewiring of a gene regulatory network. A panel of 598 gene networks was constructed in which various combinations of master regulators and transcription factors were reconnected, such that inputs to given promoters resulted in expression of different transcription factors, with their associated outputs. More than 95% of transcription site swaps are harmless, with many actually beneficial in several culture conditions. The first large-scale rewiring of a gene regulatory network (that of Escherichia coli) reveals that more than 95% of transcription site swaps are harmless, with many actually beneficial in several culture conditions.

For example, the exon junction complex (EJC) plays an important role in mRNA surveillance. The EJC also influences the first, or pioneer round of protein synthesis through a mechanism that is poorly understood. We show that the nutrient-, stress-, and energy-sensing checkpoint kinase, mTOR, contributes to the observed enhanced translation efficiency of spliced over nonspliced mRNAs. We demonstrate that, when activated, S6K1 is recruited to the newly synthesized mRNA by SKAR, which is deposited at the EJC during splicing, and that SKAR and S6K1 increase the translation efficiency of spliced mRNA. Thus, SKAR-mediated recruitment of activated S6K1 to newly processed mRNPs serves as a conduit between mTOR checkpoint signaling and the pioneer round of translation when cells exist in conditions supportive of protein synthesis."

Optical stimulation of males or females initiates the unilateral wing vibrations that normally generate the male courtship song. The pattern-generating circuit operates differently in the two sexes, producing wing movement and sound in both but authentic songs only in males and in females expressing male fru product.

https://openalex.org/W2041322170,"In mammalian cells, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) generally requires that translation terminates sufficiently upstream of a post-splicing exon junction complex (EJC) during a pioneer round of translation. The subsequent binding of Upf1 to the EJC triggers Upf1 phosphorylation. We provide evidence that phospho-Upf1 functions after nonsense codon recognition during steps that involve the translation initiation factor eIF3 and mRNA decay factors. Phospho-Upf1 interacts directly with eIF3 and inhibits the eIF3-dependent conversion of 40S/Met-tRNA(i)(Met)/mRNA to translationally competent 80S/Met-tRNA(i)(Met)/mRNA initiation complexes to repress continued translation initiation. Consistent with phospho-Upf1 impairing eIF3 function, NMD fails to detectably target nonsense-containing transcripts that initiate translation independently of eIF3 from the CrPV IRES. There is growing evidence that translational repression is a key transition that precedes mRNA delivery to the degradation machinery. Our results uncover a critical step during NMD that converts a pioneer translation initiation complex to a translationally compromised mRNP."

The evolutionary conservation of CASK and the severe deletion phenotypes suggest that CASK performs important biological roles, but the precise nature of its function has remained elusive. CASK is composed of an N-terminal CaM-kinase domain that accounts for approximately half of its primary structure and a C-terminal set of domains that is typical of MAGUKs (membrane-associated guanylate kinases), including an L27 domain, a PDZ domain, an SH3 domain, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase domain that engages in inter- and intramolecular interactions (Hsueh et al., 2000Hsueh Y.P.

A large array of CASK interactions has been described. CASK associates stoichiometrically with Mint-1 (also called X11 or Lin-10) and Velis (also called MALS or Lin-7) (Butz et al., 1998Butz S.

CASK also interacts with protein-4.1, and a trimeric complex composed of CASK, protein-4.1, and the cytoplasmic tail of neurexin-1 is a potent nucleator of actin polymerization (Biederer and Sudhof, 2001Biederer T.

CASK may bind Ca2+ channels (Maximov et al., 1999Maximov A. Sudhof T.C. Bezprozvanny I. Association of neuronal calcium channels with modular adaptor proteins.J. Biol.

CASK was proposed to associate with CASKins (Tabuchi et al., 2002Tabuchi K. Biederer T. Butz S. Sudhof T.C.

Nuclear translocation and transcription regulation by the membrane-associated guanylate kinase CASK/LIN-2.Nature. 2000; 404: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, the CASK homolog Lin-2 mediates proper localization of the EGF receptor LET-23 (Hoskins et al., 1996Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. The C. elegans vulval induction gene lin-2 encodes a member of the MAGUK family of cell junction proteins.Development. 1996; 122: 97-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CASK enhances Ether-a-go-go K+ currents via increasing its phosphorylation (Marble et al., 2005Marble D.D. Hegle A.P. Snyder 2nd, E.D. Dimitratos S. Bryant P.J. Wilson G.F. Camguk/CASK enhances Ether-a-go-go potassium current by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Finally, CASK may associate with CaM kinase II (CaMKII) and modulate its phosphorylation state (Hodge et al., 2006Hodge J.J. Mullasseril P. Griffith L.C. Activity-dependent gating of CaMKII autonomous activity by Drosophila CASK.Neuron. 2006; 51: 327-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Lu et al., 2003Lu C.S.

Drosophila CAKI/CMG protein, a homolog of human CASK, is essential for regulation of neurotransmitter vesicle release.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 1074-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The regulation of phosphorylation was thought to be indirect in both the cases, as CASK was deemed a pseudokinase. Here, we describe high-resolution crystal structures of the CaM-kinase domain of CASK complexed to different nucleotides. These structures led us to hypothesize that despite the lack of an appropriate Mg2+-binding motif, CASK may nevertheless function as a protein kinase. Indeed, we show that unlike any known kinase, the CASK CaM-kinase domain catalyzes autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to the cytoplasmic tail of neurexin-1 in the absence of Mg2+. Our data suggest that CASK is unique among protein kinases in that its CaM-kinase domain uses an unusual mechanism to phosphorylate substrates that are recruited via its MAGUK component. Based on sequence comparisons between the CASK CaM-kinase domain and the homologous kinases CaMKI (≈37% identity) and CaMKII (≈44% identity; Figure S1 available online), we produced a recombinant CASK CaM-kinase domain (residues 1–337; note that these residues are identical in mouse, rat, and human CASK) and determined its crystal structure. The CASK CaM-kinase domain was crystallized in two space groups, a reticularly twinned triclinic form (P1 form; Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 3C0G) and an orthorhombic form (P212121 form; PDB ID: 3C0I). The structures of both forms were solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the CaMKI-kinase domain (Goldberg et al., 1996Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Structural basis for the autoinhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I.Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) (PDB ID: 1A06) and refined at 2.2 Å (P1 form) and 1.85 Å resolution (P212121 form; Figures 1 and S3 and Table S1). The structures of the CASK CaM-kinase domain in the two crystal forms are highly similar (pairwise Cα root-mean-square deviation ≈ 0.4 Å), indicating that the overall structure was not significantly influenced by the crystalline environment (Figures 1A, 1B, S2A, and S3). Both the P1 and P212121 structures exhibited uninterrupted backbone electron densities throughout the entire domain from residues 5 to 304. The catalytic core of protein kinases can be divided into an N-terminal lobe that is involved in ATP binding and a C-terminal lobe that binds and positions the substrate in addition to contributing to ATP binding and ATP activation (Taylor et al., 2004Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Anand G. PKA: a portrait of protein kinase dynamics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the active state conformation, protein kinases adopt a similar overall fold that positions the elements in the N- and C-terminal lobes involved in substrate binding and catalysis in a canonical fashion (Huse and Kuriyan, 2002Huse M. Kuriyan J. The conformational plasticity of protein kinases.Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, Nolen et al., 2004Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Regulation of protein kinases; controlling activity through activation segment conformation.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). In the inactive state, in contrast, protein kinases adopt different overall folds. The CASK CaM-kinase domain exhibits a typical protein kinase fold with an N-terminal lobe dominated by a five-stranded β sheet and an α-helical C-terminal lobe (Figures 1A, 1B, S2, and S3). Comparison of the CASK CaM-kinase domain structures with those of other protein kinases revealed that the relative orientation of N- and C-terminal lobes in the CASK CaM-kinase domain is similar to that of the active state of the death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) in a complex with the ATP analog AMPPNP (Tereshko et al., 2001Tereshko V. Teplova M. Brunzelle J. Watterson D.M. Egli M. Crystal structures of the catalytic domain of human protein kinase associated with apoptosis and tumor suppression.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (PDB ID: 1IG1), thus resembling the catalytically active “closed conformation” (Figures 1A, 1B, 1D, and S2C). In contrast, the inactive form of CaMKI adopts a distinct “open conformation” with respect to the two lobes, resulting in a diminished affinity for nucleotides (Figures 1C and S2B) (Goldberg et al., 1996Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Structural basis for the autoinhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I.Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) unlike the CASK CaM-kinase domain. Equivalents of all essential elements of protein kinases were found in the CASK CaM-kinase domain (Figures 1A, 1B, S2, and S3). The N-terminal lobe encompasses a Gly-rich loop (residues 19–24 in CASK; brown) and a Lys-Glu ion pair (Lys41 and Glu62 in CASK) (Figure S5C). Furthermore, it displays an optimally positioned catalytic loop (residues 141–146 in CASK; yellow) and an activation segment (green) (Figures S5A and S5B). In kinase structures corresponding to an inactive state, such as the structures of CaMKI, MnK1, and MnK2, the activation segment is often displaced from its binding site in the C-terminal lobe and frequently is disordered (Figures 1C and S2B) (Goldberg et al., 1996Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Structural basis for the autoinhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I.Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, Jauch et al., 2006Jauch R. Cho M.K. Jakel S. Netter C. Schreiter K. Aicher B. Zweckstetter M. Jackle H. Wahl M.C. Mitogen-activated protein kinases interacting kinases are autoinhibited by a reprogrammed activation segment.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4020-4032Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, in the CASK CaM-kinase domain, the activation segment is fully ordered, and its C-terminal portion is cradled in an active state conformation within the C-terminal lobe, much like CDK2 in complex with a substrate peptide and ATP (PDB ID: 1QMZ). Superimposition of CDK2 with the CASK structure suggests that substrate peptides can bind on top of the activation segment of the CASK CaM-kinase domain oriented toward the γ-phosphate of ATP in the nucleotide-binding cleft (Figure S4B). The C-terminal lobe of the CASK CaM-kinase domain contains an equivalent of the Mg2+-binding loop. This loop is ordered in the CASK CaM-kinase domain structure (orange) as in DAPK1, while it is partially disordered in the CaMKI structure (Figures 1C and S2B). Overall, the potential catalytic elements of the CASK CaM-kinase domain could be superimposed onto corresponding elements in the DAPK1-AMPPNP cocrystal structure (Figure S2C), confirming that the structures exhibit core features and functional elements of an inherently active-state fold dissimilar to the inactive CaMKI fold. The nucleotide-binding pocket of the CASK CaM-kinase domain was occupied by 3′-AMP in the native crystal structures ( Figures 1A, 2D, S2A, and S3 and Table S1). The bound 3′-AMP is likely a byproduct of bacterial RNA degradation during protein purification. Upon soaking the crystals in 5′-AMPPNP in the presence of equimolar Mg2+, the 3′-AMP could be displaced by 5′-AMPPNP, suggesting a readily accessible adenine-nucleotide-binding site (Figures 1B, 2B, and 2E, and S2A). The CASK CaM-kinase domain, thus, adopts an intrinsically active conformation amenable to nucleotide binding. To better characterize the mode of nucleotide binding to the CASK CaM-kinase domain, we solved the structure of the best derivative crystals containing 5′-AMPPNP at 2.3 Å resolution (P1 form; PDB ID: 3C0H; Table S1). The binding mode of the nucleotide in the pocket is reminiscent of the AMPPNP-bound DAPK1 structure (Tereshko et al., 2001Tereshko V. Teplova M. Brunzelle J. Watterson D.M. Egli M. Crystal structures of the catalytic domain of human protein kinase associated with apoptosis and tumor suppression.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The N1 and N6 amino groups of the adenine form hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of Met94 and the oxygen of Glu92, respectively. Similar to the orientation of AMPPNP in the DAPK1 structure, the adenine base of the 5′-AMP moiety was found in an anti conformation, and the sugar retained a C2′-endo conformation (Figure 2B). The overall binding and orientation of the 5′-AMP portion of the nucleotide is in agreement with the binding of ATP to generic protein kinases in an active conformation (Figures 2A–2E). In protein kinases, bound nucleotides are coordinated by Mg2+ and by amino acid residues in the surrounding pocket. DAPK1 coordinates the α phosphate of AMPPNP through a hydrogen bond with Lys42. In addition, a Mg2+ ion (that in turn is bound to the Asp of the DFG motif and Asn of the catalytic loop) bridges the α and β phosphates (Tereshko et al., 2001Tereshko V. Teplova M. Brunzelle J. Watterson D.M. Egli M. Crystal structures of the catalytic domain of human protein kinase associated with apoptosis and tumor suppression.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Figure 2C). In the CASK CaM-kinase structure containing AMPPNP, the α phosphate was resolved and found to be positioned between the side chains of His145 and Lys41, without directly contacting either residue. Rather, the α phosphate is heavily hydrated and maintains water-mediated contacts to various sites in the pocket (Figures 2B and S5C). The β and γ phosphates, in contrast, were disordered; no Mg2+ ion could be discerned in the pocket, despite its presence in the crystallizing milieu. Thus, the structural data suggest that the CASK CaM-kinase domain is capable of coordinating ATP in a canonical orientation without Mg2+ and is equipped with all the structural components of a catalytic kinase, with both noticeable substitutions in the Mg2+-coordinating residues (Asp162Gly of the Mg2+-binding loop and Asn146Cys of the catalytic loop) and a consequential decoordination of the β and γ phosphates of ATP. These results indicate that the CASK CaM-kinase domain may bind unchelated nucleotides. To explore this hypothesis, we studied nucleotide binding to the CASK CaM-kinase domain. We first tested whether the CASK CaM-kinase domain interacts with the ATP analog TNP-ATP that becomes fluorescent when inserted into the hydrophobic ATP-binding pocket (Stewart et al., 1998Stewart R.C. VanBruggen R. Ellefson D.D. Wolfe A.J. TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP as probes of the nucleotide binding site of CheA, the histidine protein kinase in the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12269-12279Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the presence of EDTA, the CASK CaM-kinase domain induced a 3- to 5-fold increase in fluorescence intensity of TNP-ATP and a blue-shift of its emission maximum (Figure 3A). ATP titrations revealed that a 500-fold excess of ATP reduced the TNP-ATP fluorescence by 50% (KiATP ≈ 0.365 mM), consistent with competitive binding of ATP and TNP-ATP to a single site that exhibits a much higher affinity for TNP-ATP than for ATP (Stewart et al., 1998Stewart R.C. VanBruggen R. Ellefson D.D. Wolfe A.J. TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP as probes of the nucleotide binding site of CheA, the histidine protein kinase in the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12269-12279Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Even a 1000-fold excess of GTP had no effect on TNP-ATP binding (Figure 3B). To further dissect the specificity of nucleotide binding to the CASK CaM-kinase domain, we examined the inhibition of TNP-ATP binding by adenine, ATP, ADP, 5′-AMP, 3′-AMP, and cAMP. Only ATP efficiently inhibited TNP-ATP binding to the CASK CaM-kinase domain, while all other tested nucleotides had little effect (Figure 3C), suggesting that the CASK CaM-kinase domain specifically binds ATP. Since Mg2+ is the only divalent cation available at optimal concentration in vivo, it is invariably used as a cofactor for kinase catalysis (Waas et al., 2004Waas W.F. Rainey M.A. Szafranska A.E. Cox K. Dalby K.N. A kinetic approach towards understanding substrate interactions and the catalytic mechanism of the serine/threonine protein kinase ERK2: identifying a potential regulatory role for divalent magnesium.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, Mg2+ inhibited the increase in TNP-ATP fluorescence induced by the CASK CaM-kinase domain (Figure 3A). Titrations demonstrated that the TNP-ATP–CASK CaM-kinase domain complex is diminished at higher than equimolar concentrations of Mg2+ (KiMg2+ ≈ 10.41 μM), suggesting that Mg2+ competitively inhibits ATP binding to the CASK CaM-kinase domain (Figure S6B). Mn2+ and Ca2+ could also inhibit TNP-ATP binding (Figure 3D). The TNP moiety of TNP-ATP could potentially form atypical contacts in the binding site (Bilwes et al., 2001Bilwes A.M. Quezada C.M. Croal L.R. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Nucleotide binding by the histidine kinase CheA.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and TNP-ATP binding may not be representative of ATP binding. To address this possibility, we tested binding of the CASK CaM-kinase domain to γ32P-ATP using a dot-blot assay (Figure S6A). This assay confirmed that γ32P-ATP binds to the CASK CaM-kinase domain and that Mg2+ significantly inhibits this binding. Hence, ATP binds to the CASK CaM-kinase domain in a manner inhibited by Mg2+ and Ca2+, consistent with the absence of the DFG motif Asp and the C-loop Asn in the CASK CaM-kinase domain. Coordination of the β and γ phosphates of ATP by Mg2+ ions catalyzes phosphotransfer reactions by protein kinases (Adams, 2001Adams J.A. Kinetic and catalytic mechanisms of protein kinases.Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2271-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, Hanks and Hunter, 1995Hanks S.K. Hunter T. Protein kinases 6. The eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily: kinase (catalytic) domain structure and classification.FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). The fact that Mg2+, if anything, impairs ATP binding by the CASK CaM-kinase domain supports the notion that this domain is indeed a “pseudokinase,” despite its constitutively active conformation and avid ATP binding. To test this, we examined whether the CASK CaM-kinase domain exhibits autophosphorylation activity that is typical for CaM kinases and can be employed as a test for kinase activity (Hanley et al., 1988Hanley R.M. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. Shenolikar S. Mapping of calmodulin-binding domain of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II from rat brain.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The CASK CaM-kinase domain was autophosphorylated with nearly 13% efficiency independent of Mg2+ (Figure 4A). Tandem mass-spectrometry identified a single autophosphorylated CASK peptide containing residues 141–159 (DVKPHCVLLASKENSAPVK; data not shown). The phosphorylated peptide is located in a surface-exposed loop preceding the GFG motif (Figure S4A). Since the autophosphorylated peptide is remote from the substrate binding pocket, we speculate that autophosphorylation occurs in trans. The autophosphorylation assay was used to calculate the Michaelis constant (KmATP) of the CASK CaM-kinase domain for ATP (Figure 4B), revealing a KmATP of ≈0.563 mM that is within the range of KmATP's for active kinases (Warmuth et al., 2007Warmuth M. Kim S. Gu X.J. Xia G. Adrian F. Ba/F3 cells and their use in kinase drug discovery.Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2007; 19: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We measured the limiting rate of autophosphorylation in experiments that approached saturation. Again, the Vmax for autophosphorylation of the CASK CaM-kinase domain (≈4.9 nmol/μmol enzyme/min), although low, is similar to those of some other kinases, such as Giardia lamblia PKA (Vmax ≈ 6.2 nmol/μmol enzyme/min; Abel et al., 2001Abel E.S.

https://openalex.org/W2094188595,"Recent studies have shown that nitrite is an important storage form and source of NO in biological systems. Controversy remains, however, regarding whether NO formation from nitrite occurs primarily in tissues or in blood. Questions also remain regarding the mechanism, magnitude, and contributions of several alternative pathways of nitrite-dependent NO generation in biological systems. To characterize the mechanism and magnitude of NO generation from nitrite, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, and immunoassays of cGMP formation were performed. The addition of nitrite triggered a large amount of NO generation in tissues such as heart and liver, but only trace NO production in blood. Carbon monoxide increased NO release from blood, suggesting that hemoglobin acts to scavenge NO not to generate it. Administration of the xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor oxypurinol or aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor raloxifene significantly decreased NO generation from nitrite in heart or liver. NO formation rates increased dramatically with decreasing pH or with decreased oxygen tension. Isolated enzyme studies further confirm that XO and AO, but not hemoglobin, are critical nitrite reductases. Overall, NO generation from nitrite mainly occurs in tissues not in the blood, with XO and AO playing critical roles in nitrite reduction, and this process is regulated by pH, oxygen tension, nitrite, and reducing substrate concentrations. Recent studies have shown that nitrite is an important storage form and source of NO in biological systems. Controversy remains, however, regarding whether NO formation from nitrite occurs primarily in tissues or in blood. Questions also remain regarding the mechanism, magnitude, and contributions of several alternative pathways of nitrite-dependent NO generation in biological systems.

Nitric oxide is a free radical produced in biological tissues that exerts a large number of critical regulatory functions and also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cellular injury (1Marletta M.A. Yoon P.S. Iyengar R. Leaf C.D. Wishnok J.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8706-8711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). In addition to NO generation from specific NO synthases (NOSs), 3The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; Hb, hemoglobin; AO, aldehyde oxidase; XO, xanthine oxidase; XOR, xanthine oxidoreductase; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; CP, cytochrome P-450; MGD, N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. it is now clear that nitrite can also be an important source of NO, particularly under acidic conditions (2Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of nitrite reduction in biological systems remains highly controversial. Furthermore, it is unknown whether NO formation from nitrite occurs primarily in tissues or in blood. Questions remain regarding the mechanism, magnitude, and contributions of the several proposed pathways of nitrite-dependent NO generation in biological systems. Recent studies reported a novel role for hemoglobin as a nitrite reductase reducing nitrite to NO and eliciting vasodilation. Based on these studies, erythrocytes were proposed to be the major intravascular site of nitrite reduction and storage (3Cosby K. Partovi K.S. Crawford J.H. Patel R.P. Reiter C.D. Martyr S. Yang B.K.

However, it is well known that hemoglobin is an extremely effective NO scavenger (9Joshi M.S. Ferguson Jr., T.B. Han T.H. Hyduke D.R. Liao J.C. Rassaf T. Bryan N. Feelisch M. Lancaster Jr., J.R.

The mechanism by which NO escapes trapping by the high concentrations of hemoglobin in the blood remains a mystery with resultant controversy regarding the relative importance of nitrite reduction in blood and tissues. Therefore there is a great need to elucidate the relative importance and molecular mechanisms of NO formation from nitrite in blood and tissues. Initially nitrite was considered as a product of NO metabolism, not a source of NO, in tissues. In 1995, we observed that nitrite can be a prominent source of NO in biological tissues under conditions of intracellular acidosis, as occur following the onset of ischemia with a lack of tissue perfusion (2Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Several alternative pathways of nitrite-dependent NO generation have been observed occurring in biological systems. NO formation can occur by the simple process of nitrite disproportionation (2Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 11Benjamin N. O'Driscoll F. Dougall H. Duncan C. Smith L. Golden M. McKenzie H.

Several enzymatic systems have been reported to be involved in nitrite reduction with NO generation in biological systems. Xanthine oxidase (XO) has a similar structure to bacterial nitrite reductase (15Zhang Z. Naughton D. Winyard P.G. Benjamin N. Blake D.R. Symons M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). XO reduces nitrite to NO at the molybdenum site of the enzyme with xanthine, NADH, or aldehyde substrates serving to provide the requisite reducing equivalents (16Godber B.L. Doel J.J. Sapkota G.P.

This NOS-independent NO production could serve as a source of NO under ischemic conditions where NO production from NOS is significantly impaired (17Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24482-24489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 18Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L.

Aldehyde oxidase (AO) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays an important role in the biotransformation of drugs and xenobiotics (21Yoshihara S. Tatsumi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 242: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of AO and XO are remarkably similar, with ∼86% homology, and they belong to the same family of molybdenum-containing proteins with two iron-sulfur clusters, a flavin cofactor, and a molybdopterin cofactor (22Calzi M.L. Raviolo C. Ghibaudi E. de Gioia L. Salmona M. Cazzaniga G. Kurosaki M. Terao M. Garattini E. J. Biol.

S. A. 1993; 90: 10690-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, no prior research has been done to investigate whether AO has the similar ability to catalyze nitrite reduction to NO. Furthermore, the mechanism, magnitude, and quantitative importance of AO-mediated nitrite reduction in biological systems has not been studied. In addition to the molybdenum enzymes XO and AO, ubiquinone/cytochrome bc1 complex of the mitochondrial electron chain also has been identified as a site where nitrite is reduced (24Kozlov A.V. Staniek K. Nohl H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 25Nohl H. Staniek K. Sobhian B. Bahrami S. Redl H. Kozlov A.V. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2000; 47: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Nitrite can also accept electrons from cytochrome P-450 (CP) of liver microsomes (26Raikhman L.M. Annaev B.B. Biofizika. 1971; 16: 1135-1137PubMed Google Scholar, 27Duthu G.S. Shertzer H.G. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1979; 7: 263-269PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of excessive nitrite, significant NO generation from CP was detected, suggesting that CP-mediated nitrite reduction can be a source of NO (28Li H. Liu X. Cui H. Chen Y.R. Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12546-12554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is now certain that there are multiple pathways of NO generation from nitrite in biological systems, but questions remain concerning the localization, magnitude, mechanism, and biological significance of these NOS-independent sources of NO under physiological or pathological conditions. To characterize the mechanism and magnitude of NO generation from nitrite in tissues and blood, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, NO electrode, and immunoassays of cGMP formation were performed. These studies demonstrate that NO is generated largely from nitrite reduction in tissues not in the blood. Hemoglobin in red cells is observed to function as a trap rather than a functional source of NO. The molybdenum enzymes XO and AO are shown to be important sources of nitrite-derived NO in tissues with this nitrite-dependent NO generation regulated by pH, oxygen tension, nitrite, and reducing substrate concentrations. Materials—XO, NADH, sodium nitrite, bovine hemoglobin, oxypurinol, dithiothreitol, raloxifene chloride, clotrimazole, rotenone, antifoam, and NG-methyl-l-arginine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) was obtained from Alexis Biochemical Corporation (San Diego, CA). Direct cGMP assay kit was obtained from Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI), and cGMP production was quantified by immunoassay according to the protocol provided by the company. N-Methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (MGD) was synthesized using carbon disulfide and N-methyl-d-glucamine (29Shinobu L.A. Jones S.G. Jones M.M. Acta Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1984; 54: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 30Zweier J.L. Wang P. Kuppusamy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 304-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Ferrous ammonium sulfate was purchased from Aldrich (99.997%). [15N]Nitrite was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was obtained from Invitrogen. Millipore ultra free centrifugal filter (nominal molecular weight limit, 10,000) was obtained from Fisher. Rat Tissues and Blood Preparation—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were heparinized with 500 units of heparin and anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital at a dose of 30–35 mg/kg. Rat blood was obtained from the abdominal aorta using a 10-ml syringe containing 0.1 ml of heparin. The livers, hearts, and aorta rings were excised and washed with PBS to remove any residual blood and then minced into small pieces (∼0.01 g/piece). This minced tissue was then rinsed again with PBS to assure wash out of any remaining RBCs. The reaction mixture was placed in a purging vessel with 50 μl of antifoam to prevent foaming during the gentle purging and maintained at 37 °C. Hemoglobin Preparation—Oxyhemoglobin was obtained from hemoglobin (2 mm) with the addition of excess sodium dithionate, followed by separation on a Sephadex G-25 column (31Keszler A. Mason R.P. Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Deoxyhemoglobin was obtained from oxyhemoglobin with the purging of argon. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker EMX spectrometer with an HS resonator operating at X-band. The measurements were performed at ambient temperature with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 2.5 G, and microwave power of 20 milliwatt. 15NO generated from the reaction solution was purged out using argon to a vessel that contained 5 ml of the Fe2+-MGD spin trap solution, as previously described (19Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16939-16946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This set-up was designed to isolate the reaction solution from the spin trap and thus avoid any possible perturbation caused by Fe2+-MGD complexes on the reaction system. Fe2+-MGD complexes were prepared by adding solid ferrous ammonium sulfate and MGD (molar ratio, 1:5) to the deoxygenated (argon-purged) solution with a final concentration of 2 mm in iron. Quantitation of NO formation and trapping were performed by double integration of observed EPR signal in comparison with that from a similar aqueous NO-iron-MGD standard (19Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16939-16946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescence Measurements—The rate of the NO production was measured using a Sievers 270B nitric oxide analyzer interfaced through a DT2821 A to D board to a PC. In the analyzer, NO is reacted with ozone forming excited state NO2, which emits light. Mixing of reagents and separation of NO from the reaction mixture were done at controlled temperature in a glass purging vessel equipped with heating jacket. The release of NO was quantified by analysis of the digitally recorded signal from the photomultiplier tube using specially designed data acquisition and analysis software developed in our laboratory. After an initial 30 s of equilibration of the flow from the purging vessel to the detector, the signal provides the rate of NO formation over time (32Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Calibration of the magnitude of NO production was determined from the integral of the signal over time compared with that from nitrite concentration standards (14Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 18Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Compared with measurements performed in argon, the efficiency of NO measurement in air or 10, 5, or 2% oxygen/nitrogen, was 91.9, 92.5, 96.3, or 98.6%, respectively, The results showed that the chemiluminescence linearly increased with NO generation when purging with any of these gas mixtures (γ2 > 99%) (19Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16939-16946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Purification of AO from Rat Liver—Liver AO was purified as we recently reported (33Kundu T.K. Hille R. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 460: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). AO activity was determined by the oxidation of AO substrate; one unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 1 μmol of substrate 4-(dimethylamino) cinnamaldehyde/min at 30 °C (33Kundu T.K. Hille R. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 460: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Immunoassay of Guanylyl Cyclase Activity—Activation of soluble sGC was investigated by employing enzyme-linked immunoassay. After incubation of tissues pieces (0.2 g/ml) with 10 μm nitrite and with 1 ml of reaction buffer (10 ng of sGC, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm GTP in 1 ml of PBS) at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions, the tissues in the samples were removed using Millipore filter (centrifuged 2000 × g, 10 min, at 4 °C). Comparative study in blood instead of tissues was performed by incubation of nitrite (10 μm) with 10 ng of sGC, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm GTP in 1 ml of blood. The measurements of cGMP in the solution were performed using direct cGMP assay kit by immunoassay according to the manufacturer's product protocol. The standard curve was obtained with known amounts of cGMP. Statistical Analysis—The values are expressed as the means of at least three repeated measurements and reported ± S.D., unless noted otherwise. The statistical significance of difference was evaluated by Student's t test. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered to indicate statistical significance. NO Generation from Tissues, Blood, and Hemoglobin—To investigate the mechanism and magnitude of NO generation from nitrite in tissues and blood, EPR spectroscopy was applied to directly measure NO generation under anaerobic conditions. Rat tissue or blood was subjected to hypoxia in the presence of isotopically labeled nitrite. Rat tissue (liver, heart, or vessels) was isolated and cut into pieces (∼0.01 g) suspended in PBS and purged with argon. NO production from [15N]nitrite in anoxic tissue or blood was measured by EPR spectroscopy. 15NO generated was purged from the reaction vessel using argon to a secondary vessel containing the spin trap Fe2+-MGD. 15NO is paramagnetic and binds with high affinity to the water-soluble spin trap Fe2+-MGD forming the mononitrosyl iron complex that exhibits a characteristic doublet 15NO-Fe2+-MGD spectrum, rather than the triplet observed with natural abundance 14NO, enabling direct and selective detection of nitrite-derived NO formation. From the intensity of the observed spectrum, quantitative measurement of NO generation can be performed (2Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 34Xia Y. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18797-18803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 35Lancaster Jr., J.R. Langrehr J.M. Bergonia H.A. Murase N. Simmons R.L. Hoffman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10994-10998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With 5 ml of rat blood in the reaction vessel, without the addition of nitrite, no NO generation was detected (Fig. 1A). Following the addition of 100 μm nitrite, still no signal was seen. Even with addition of 500 μm nitrite, only a trace NO signal appeared after 30 min (Fig. 1B). After gently purging the blood with CO gas for 2 min, followed by the addition of nitrite (500 μm), the trapped NO signal was more than 2-fold higher than that without prepurging of CO (Fig. 1C). This experiment indicated that with binding of CO to hemoglobin, which blocks its heme group, significantly increased NO release was detected from blood. In contrast to the very low level of NO production in blood, high level production was seen from the tissues studied. When 1 g of minced aortic ring, heart, or liver was suspended in 5 ml of PBS (pH 7.0), the addition of nitrite (100 μm) triggered marked NO generation over 30 min (Fig. 1, D–F). Over 30 min, the NO generation was greater in liver (211 ± 34 nm), heart (132 ± 21 nm), or aorta (82 ± 11 nm) than in blood (5 ± 1 nm without CO, or 15 ± 2 nm in the presence of CO, both with 5-fold higher nitrite levels than in the tissue studies). To further quantitate the rates of NO generation from nitrite, studies were performed using a chemiluminescence NO analyzer. NO was purged from the solution by argon and then reacted with ozone in the analyzer to form excited state NO2, which emits light. For the purging vessel and flows used, it takes about 30 s for NO to reach the detector. Only after this 30-s delay is the signal recorded by the detector proportional to the rate of NO generation in the reaction chamber. This method provides direct measurement of the rate of NO generation as a function of time. With the addition of nitrite (100 μm), prominent NO formation was seen from 1 g of minced liver, heart, or aortic ring in 5 ml of PBS (pH 7.0) (Fig. 2A, traces a–c). However, in the presence of 5 ml of blood, with the addition of 100 μm nitrite, no significant NO generation was seen. With a 5-fold higher nitrite concentration (500 μm) added to 5 ml of blood under anaerobic conditions, still only trace amount of NO generation was seen (Fig. 2B, trace b). Further studies were performed using blood (5 ml) pretreated with carbon monoxide. After gentle purging with CO gas for 2 min, the addition of nitrite (500 μm) triggered greatly increased NO release from the blood (Fig. 2B, trace a). To further characterize hemoglobin-mediated nitrite reduction and quantitate NO release in this process, low temperature EPR studies of isolated hemoglobin were performed. Deoxyhemoglobin (200 μm) and nitrite (200 μm) were mixed under anaerobic conditions for 15 min and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. The formation of nitrosylhemoglobin was observed by EPR spectroscopy at 77 K (Fig. 3). However, with purging no NO release was detected by EPR spin trapping, or chemiluminescence NO analyzer, under either anaerobic conditions or different oxygen tensions (purging with argon, air, or 2, 5, or 10% oxygen; data not shown). Similarly with NO electrode (17Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24482-24489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), no NO release was detected from deoxyhemoglobin (200 μm) and nitrite (200 μm). Even with higher nitrite concentrations of 1 mm, no significant NO release was detected. Only with the presence of large excess amounts of nitrite (10 mm) was NO release observed from hemoglobin (200 μm) (Fig. 3B, trace b). In contrast to reports that deoxyhemoglobin can reduce nitrite to NO and that erythrocytes are the major source of nitrite reduction in blood (3Cosby K. Partovi K.S. Crawford J.H. Patel R.P.

Investig. 2005; 115: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), we observed no release of NO from blood unless there was a large excess of nitrite. Kinetics of Nitrite-dependent NO Generation—To further characterize the mechanism and magnitude of nitrite-dependent NO formation, kinetic studies of the effects of nitrite concentration on the magnitude of NO generation were performed. The rate of NO formation derived from nitrite reduction was measured under anaerobic conditions using the NO analyzer. Following the addition of nitrite (0.01 mm-4 mm), prominent generation of NO was detected from 1 g of minced liver (Fig. 4, A, line a, and B, line a) or heart (Fig. 4, A, line b, and B, line b) in 5 ml of PBS (pH 7.0). The rate of NO formation increased linearly with the increase in nitrite concentration at physiological or pathophysiological levels (10 μm–100 μm). In contrast to this, the NO generation measured in blood was over 50-fold lower (Fig. 4A, line c). Effects of Oxygen on NO Generation from Nitrite—In mammalian organs under normoxic conditions, the O2 concentration ranges from 10 to <0.5%, with values of ∼14% in arterial blood and <4% in the myocardium (36Zhao X.

To determine whether nitrite can be reduced to form NO in tissues and to ascertain the effects of oxygen tension in this process, NO chemiluminescence studies were performed. NO formation from rat liver, heart, and blood was measured with continuous purging of air or 10, 5, or 2% oxygen, corresponding to oxygen concentrations in solution at 37 °C of 214, 102, 51, and 20 μm, respectively. The NOS inhibitor NG-methyl-l-arginine (5 mm) was added to prevent any possible NO generation from l-arginine. It was observed that the rate of NO generation decreased with the increase of pO2 either in the liver (Fig. 5A), heart (Fig. 5B), or blood (Fig. 5C). Again, NO generation from blood was much less than that produced in tissues even in the presence of a five times higher amount of nitrite in blood than in tissues. Thus, NO generation from nitrite can be a source of NO in tissues under conditions of tissue normoxia, and it is further increased with mild hypoxia. Effects of pH on Nitrite-dependent NO Generation—Under ischemic conditions, marked intracellular acidosis occurs, and pH values in tissues, such as the heart, can fall to levels of 6.0 or below. To assess NO generation from nitrite under different physiological or pathological conditions and to further characterize the mechanism of nitrite reduction, experiments were performed to measure the effect of pH on the magnitude of NO generation from nitrite in liver and heart. As shown in Table 1, it was observed that under acidic conditions increased NO generation occurs. In contrast, under alkaline conditions, prominent inhibition was seen.TABLE 1Effect of pH on NO generation from nitrite reductionNO generation ratepH 5.0pH 6.0pH 7.0pH 8.0nm s-1aMaximal NO generation rates were measured by chemiluminescence NO analyzer as described in Fig. 2.

https://openalex.org/W2142884277,"Mechanisms by which Wnt pathways integrate the organization of receptors, organelles, and cytoskeletal proteins to confer cell polarity and directional cell movement are incompletely understood. We show that acute responses to Wnt5a involve recruitment of actin, myosin IIB, Frizzled 3, and melanoma cell adhesion molecule into an intracellular structure in a melanoma cell line. In the presence of a chemokine gradient, this Wnt-mediated receptor–actin–myosin polarity (W-RAMP) structure accumulates asymmetrically at the cell periphery, where it triggers membrane contractility and nuclear movement in the direction of membrane retraction. The process requires endosome trafficking, is associated with multivesicular bodies, and is regulated by Wnt5a through the small guanosine triphosphatases Rab4 and RhoB. Thus, cell-autonomous mechanisms allow Wnt5a to control cell orientation, polarity, and directional movement in response to positional cues from chemokine gradients."
https://openalex.org/W2082162397,"In budding yeast, key meiotic events such as DNA replication, recombination, and the meiotic divisions are controlled by Clb cyclin-dependent kinases (Clb-CDKs). Using a novel synchronization procedure, we have characterized the activity of these Clb-CDKs and observed a surprising diversity in their regulation during the meiotic divisions. Clb1-CDK activity is restricted to meiosis I, and Clb3-CDK activity to meiosis II, through 5'UTR-mediated translational control of its transcript. The analysis of cells inappropriately producing Clb3-CDKs during meiosis I furthermore defines Clb3 as an inhibitor of the meiosis I chromosome segregation program. Our results demonstrate an essential role for Clb-CDK regulation in establishing the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2157927045,"In iron-replete environments, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Fur (ferric uptake regulator) protein represses expression of two small regulatory RNAs encoded by prrF1 and prrF2. Here we describe the effects of iron and PrrF regulation on P. aeruginosa physiology. We show that PrrF represses genes encoding enzymes for the degradation of anthranilate (i.e. antABC), a precursor of the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS). Under iron-limiting conditions, PQS production was greatly decreased in a DeltaprrF1,2 mutant as compared with wild type. The addition of anthranilate to the growth medium restored PQS production to the DeltaprrF1,2 mutant, indicating that its defect in PQS production is a consequence of anthranilate degradation. PA2511 was shown to encode an anthranilate-dependent activator of the ant genes and was subsequently renamed antR. AntR was not required for regulation of antA by PrrF but was required for optimal iron activation of antA. Furthermore, iron was capable of activating both antA and antR in a DeltaprrF1,2 mutant, indicating the presence of two distinct yet overlapping pathways for iron activation of antA (AntR-dependent and PrrF-dependent). Additionally, several quorum-sensing regulators, including PqsR, influenced antA expression, demonstrating that regulation of anthranilate metabolism is intimately woven into the quorum-sensing network of P. aeruginosa. Overall, our data illustrate the extensive control that both iron regulation and quorum sensing exercise in basic cellular physiology, underlining how intermediary metabolism can affect the regulation of virulence factors in P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2035278845,"Skin plays an essential role, mediated in part by its remarkable vascular plasticity, in adaptation to environmental stimuli. Certain vertebrates, such as amphibians, respond to hypoxia in part through the skin; but it is unknown whether this tissue can influence mammalian systemic adaptation to low oxygen levels. We have found that epidermal deletion of the hypoxia-responsive transcription factor HIF-1alpha inhibits renal erythropoietin (EPO) synthesis in response to hypoxia. Conversely, mice with an epidermal deletion of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) factor, a negative regulator of HIF, have increased EPO synthesis and polycythemia. We show that nitric oxide release induced by the HIF pathway acts on cutaneous vascular flow to increase systemic erythropoietin expression. These results demonstrate that in mice the skin is a critical mediator of systemic responses to environmental oxygen."

This model reveals connections between music-theoretical concepts, yields new analytical tools, unifies existing geometrical representations, and suggests a way to understand similarity between chord types."
https://openalex.org/W2057945351,"It has been widely assumed that the atomic structure of the flagellar filament from Salmonella typhimurium serves as a model for all bacterial flagellar filaments given the sequence conservation in the coiled-coil regions responsible for polymerization. On the basis of electron microscopic images, we show that the flagellar filaments from Campylobacter jejuni have seven protofilaments rather than the 11 in S. typhimurium. The vertebrate Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) recognizes a region of bacterial flagellin that is involved in subunit-subunit assembly in Salmonella and many other pathogenic bacteria, and this short region has diverged in Campylobacter and related bacteria, such as Helicobacter pylori, which are not recognized by TLR5. The driving force in the change of quaternary structure between Salmonella and Campylobacter may have been the evasion of TLR5."

Tau can be phosphorylated at various sites by other kinases (e.g. mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)), but the phosphorylation at KXGS motifs results in the strongest reduction of Tau binding to microtubules, with the consequence that microtubules, which serve as tracks for axonal transport, are no longer stabilized and fall apart. The detached Tau accumulates in the cytosol and gradually polymerizes into paired helical filaments that bundle up into neurofibrillary tangles, forming one of the two pathological aggregates in Alzheimer disease (for reviews, see Refs. 3Binder L.I.

MARK/Par-1 kinases belong to the AMPK/Snf1 subfamily (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/sucrose non-fermenting 1) of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMK) group (5Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar). Homologous genes have been found in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to mammals. In mammals, the MARK family consists of four members (MARK1–4) with a conserved domain organization (Fig. 1A). An N-terminal header (N) precedes the catalytic protein kinase domain (6Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6315) Google Scholar), which is linked to a putative common docking domain (CD, Ref. 7Panneerselvam S. Marx A. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E.

Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This is followed by a ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA), a spacer domain, and a tail domain which includes the kinase-associated domain (KA1; Ref. 9Tochio N. Koshiba S. Kobayashi N. Inoue M.

The UBA and KA1 domains are conserved among the AMPK-related protein kinases and MARKs; their functions are poorly understood but may be related to ubiquitin-dependent signaling or supramolecular folding with an impact on activity (10Elbert M. Rossi G. Brennwald P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 532-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One important function of MARK/Par-1 is the regulation of the microtubule dynamics by altering the affinity of the Tau protein and its functional relatives MAP2c and MAP4 toward the microtubules (11Drewes G.

The kinases MARKK/TAO1 (thousand and one amino acids) and the serine/threonine kinase LKB1 activate all four MARK isoforms by phosphorylation of a threonine residue (Thr-208 in MARK2) in the activation loop of the catalytic domain (24Timm T.

This threonine is conserved in many eukaryotic serine/threonine kinases and often regulates their activity. Fig. 1B displays the activation loops of several serine/threonine kinases where phosphorylation sites are highlighted. Another modulator of the activity of MARK is the kinase p21-activated kinase 5 (PAK5): The two kinases interact via their kinase domains so that MARK (but not PAK5) is inhibited (26Matenia D.

The scaffold protein 14-3-3 binds to MARK/Par-1 at two sites, either in the catalytic domain (27Benton R. Palacios I.M. St. Johnston D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 659-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or in the spacer domain after phosphorylation by atypical protein kinase C, leading to relocalization and inactivation of MARK (28Suzuki A.

In MARK, the regulatory threonine in the activation loop is followed by a serine (Ser-212 in MARK2), which is conserved in many kinases. Changing it into a glutamate yielded an inactive kinase, which suggests that MARK phosphorylated at Ser-212 is inactive (24Timm T. Li X.-Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.-M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However the kinase responsible for this regulatory event is a matter of debate. A recent report claimed that GSK3β phosphorylates this site and activates MARK2 (30Kosuga S. Tashiro E. Kajioka T. Ueki M. Shimizu Y. Imoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42715-42722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By contrast, we report here data showing that GSK3β in fact inhibits MARK by phosphorylating this site. Because both kinases are involved in several interconnected regulatory pathways, this finding has important consequences for interpreting the roles of GSK3β and MARK. MARK2 Preparation from Escherichia coli and MARKK Preparation from Sf9 Cells—Recombinant kinases were expressed as fusion proteins with a polyhistidine tag in E. coli (DE3 pLys) or Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system BaculoGold™ (BD Pharmingen), respectively.

The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA™ column (Qiagen). After washing with buffer A, the protein was eluted with a short gradient of 50–500 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 50% glycerol) and stored at -20 °C.

The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA™ column (Qiagen). After washing with buffer C, the protein was eluted with a short gradient of 50–500 mm imidazole. Fractions containing GSK3β were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF). The sample was loaded onto a Mono S™ column (Amersham Biosciences/GE-Healthcare) and eluted in a gradient of 100–1000 mm NaCl. The eluted protein was dialyzed against buffer B (see above) and stored at -20 °C.

Confluent monolayers were subcultured by scraping the cells and diluting in the ratio of 1:4 in complete medium. For the expression of proteins in Sf9 cells, the actively growing cells (80% confluence) were infected with recombinant baculovirus. The MOI (multiplicity of infection) was 1–3. The cells were incubated with the virus at 27 °C for 66–72 h. Neuroblastoma N2a/F113 cells stably expressing htau40 were grown in a medium containing MEM (minimal Earle's medium), 10% FCS, 1% l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acid, and 600 μg/ml gentamycin 418. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For Western blot analysis, 1.5–3 × 106 cells/well were grown in a 6-well plate for 24 h, and the cells were transiently transfected with appropriate plasmids using Effectene (Qiagen). 24 h after transfection, the cells were differentiated with 2 ml of differentiation medium (MEM, 0.1% FCS, 0.1% nonessential amino acids, 2 μm retinoic acid) for 6 h. The cells were washed once with 3 ml of PBS. Then 1 ml of PBS was added, and the cells were scraped and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 s.

CHO wild-type cells and stably transfected with hTau40 were grown in HAM's F12 medium with 10% FCS and incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For stable transfection, we added G418 (600 μg/ml, Invitrogen) to the culture medium. Cells were seeded at 70% confluency in 24-well plates (1.8 cm2) on coverslips and transfected with DOTAP (Roche Applied Science), followed by immunofluorescence analysis at various time points. PC12 cells (2 × 104 cells) were grown in a 24-well plate (2 cm2) precoated overnight with poly-d-lysine. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

The differentiation of PC12 cells was carried out in differentiation medium (DMEM/F12, 1:1) containing 0.1% serum and 100 ng/ml NGF for 24–72 h. Cortical Neurons—Cortex tissue dissected from E18 rat embryos was digested with 0.1% trypsin for 30 min. Plating medium was then added, and the dissociated cells were gently centrifuged and resuspended in plating medium. The dissociated neurons were plated at a density of 100 neurons/mm2 on a 24-well plate (2 cm2) precoated overnight with poly-d-lysine. After culturing for 4 h, the medium was changed to neuronal culture medium (Neurobasal medium with B-27 and l-glutamine), and the cells were grown for 3–4 days. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Then the cells were washed with PBS three times. Permeabilization was carried out by adding 80% ice-cold methanol and incubated for 5 min at -20 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 10% goat serum at 37 °C for 45 min.

Western Blotting—Proteins were separated on SDS gels and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-dry blotting (1 mA/cm2, 1 h). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature and then treated with the selected primary antibody (ABpS212 1:500, Ref. 24Timm T.

GSK3β Phosphorylates MARK2 at Serine 212 and Reduces Its Activity in Vitro—MARK isolated from porcine brain is in part phosphorylated at both Thr-208 and Ser-212 (numbering according to MARK2; see Fig. 1) in the activation loop (11Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the first threonine (Thr-208) by MARKK leads to the activation of all four MARK isoforms (24Timm T. Li X.-Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.-M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This activation is possible only if the subsequent serine (Ser-212) is present: changing Ser-212 to Ala or Glu abolishes the kinase activity completely, despite the activating phosphorylation of Thr-208 (24Timm T. Li X.-Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.-M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This suggests that the phosphorylation of this residue might also lead to inactivation of MARK. Because the Ser-212 in the activation loop is followed by a proline, we tested several proline-directed kinases as candidates. As seen in Fig. 2, different kinases such as the stress- or mitogen-activated protein kinases p38/SAPK, ERK1, ERK2, the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdc2, Cdk5, and GSK3β were tested. Casein kinase I (CKI) was also tested because the serine in the activation loop of MARK resembles the substrate recognition site of CKI. Only GSK3β exhibited an effect on MARK by reducing its activity (Fig. 2A). This lead us to focus on GSK3β, which is also of great interest in the context of AD because it phosphorylates Tau efficiently at Ser/Thr-Pro motifs that are elevated in AD (31Hanger D.P. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Brion J.P. Anderton B.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 147: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 32Mandelkow E.-M. Drewes G. Biernat J. Gustke N. Van Lint J. Vandenheede J.R. Mandelkow E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In addition, we could show that MARK and GSK3β co-purified through several steps of purification (11Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 33Godemann R. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.-M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To exclude the influence of impurities, especially co-purifying kinases, we used bacterially expressed GSK3β and MARK2 for an in vitro kinase assay. The effect of GSK3β on MARK2 was monitored by its activity toward the peptide TR1, which is derived from the first repeat of Tau containing Ser-262. This peptide is only phosphorylated by MARK2 and not by GSK3β. Fig. 2B shows the influence of GSK3β on MARK2 activity with time. MARK2 was preincubated with GSK3β for different times, then the peptide was added, and the reaction continued for 30 min. The black curve describes the constant activity of MARK2 alone (1 unit = 55 nmol/min/mg). Under the influence of GSK3β, this activity is reduced to one-fourth after 2 h of preincubation. The axis at the bottom depicts the total assay time; note that the two curves meet at 0 min as expected. We next examined the effect of GSK3β on MARK2T208A and MARK2S212A mutants. Similar to the wild-type kinase, MARK2T208A is reduced in its activity by GSK3β (Fig. 2C, compare lane 1 with 2 and 3 with 4). The mutation of the Ser-212 to Ala renders the kinase inactive (see also Ref. 24Timm T. Li X.-Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.-M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); hence there is no effect of GSK3β (lanes 5 and 6). The autoradiography in Fig. 2D shows that the inactivation of MARK by GSK3β is accompanied by its phosphorylation. Only the wild-type and the T208A mutant are phosphorylated, but not the S212A mutant (lanes 2 and 4, compare with 6). We conclude that GSK3β phosphorylates MARK2 on Ser-212 to inactivate the kinase. This is further confirmed by a Western blot of equivalent samples shown in Fig. 2E (lanes 1–3). An antibody specific for phosphorylated Ser-212 of MARK2 (AbpS212, rabbit antibody raised against a peptide from the activation loop phosphorylated at Ser-212; see Ref. 24Timm T. Li X.-Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.-M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) gives a signal in the cases of wild-type and T208A mutants phosphorylated by GSK3β (lanes 2 and 3), but not with the S212A mutant (lane 4). Lane 1 confirms that the antibody reacts with MARK phosphorylated at Ser-212. This lane shows MARK, a partially purified kinase from porcine brain identified as a mix of MARK1 and 2 (11Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Note that the apparent molecular mass is significantly higher than expected for MARK1 or MARK2 (110 kDa versus 88 or 81 kDa), probably due to post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation. This enzyme is easily degraded by proteases, as indicated by lower Mr fragments (2Drewes G. Trinczek B. Illenberger S. Biernat J. Schmitt-Ulms G. Meyer H.E. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7679-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 11Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GSK3β inhibits MARK2 even when it is activated by MARKK or by the activating mutation T208E (Fig. 2F). The activity of MARK2, activated by MARKK (compare lane 1 with 2) is reduced upon addition of GSK3 (lane 3). As expected, the inactive mutant S212A is neither activated by MARKK (lanes 4 and 5), nor inhibited by GSK3β (lane 6). The active mutant T208E (lane 7) is markedly reduced in its activity by incubation with GSK3β (lane 8). These results clearly indicate that GSK3β inhibits MARK2 by phosphorylating Ser-212. The same results were obtained with GSK3β expressed and purified from Sf9-cells. MARK2 Wild Type and Mutants Phosphorylate Tau Differentially—The activity of MARK2wt and mutants was checked in cellular conditions by transfecting the kinases into N2a/F113 cells stably expressing htau40 (human Tau, longest isoform in CNS). After 24 h, the cells were differentiated with retinoic acid for 6 h. The results were monitored on Western blots with the pan Tau antibody K9JA and the pS262-specific Tau antibody 12E8. As expected, wild-type MARK2 exhibited high activity toward Tau at Ser-262, compared with untransfected cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). The non-activable MARK2T208A mutant had only low activity (lane 3), and the S212A mutant as well as the T208A/S212A mutant resulted in no 12E8 reactivity (lanes 4 and 5). The level of MARK2wt and mutants and the level of Tau are similar in all transfections (shown by the loading control of β-actin staining). These data on cells correlate closely with the in vitro data, arguing that Ser-212 must be present for the activity of MARK2 (i.e. it cannot be changed by mutation or phosphorylation), and that the phosphorylation of Thr-208 is needed for activation. Co-expression of Active GSK3βS9A with MARK2wt or Active MARK2T208E in Cells Reduces the Phosphorylation of Tau at Ser-262—To investigate the effect of GSK3β on MARK in cells, we transfected N2a/F113 cells with either MARK2wt or the constitutively active mutant MARK2T208E alone or together with constitutively active GSK3βS9A. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were differentiated with retinoic acid for 6 h. The activity of MARK was monitored by the phosphorylation of Tau at Ser-262 using the 12E8 antibody in Western blots. Comparable amounts of kinases in single and double transfections are depicted by HA antibody for MARK2wt and with GFP antibody for MARK2T208E and GSK3βS9A, which are both fused to ECFP. As seen in Fig. 3B, the expression of MARK2wt and constitutively active MARK2T208E increased the phosphorylation of Tau at Ser-262 compared with untransfected cells (compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1). But upon co-transfection with active GSK3βS9A, this phosphorylation strongly decreased (lanes 4 and 5). Although we see a reduction in the expression level of MARK2T208E when co-transfected with active GSK3βS9A (lane 5) the phosphorylation of Tau at Ser-262 is reduced to a much greater extent. These results demonstrate that GSK3β inhibits MARK2 not only in vitro but also in cells. Co-expression of GSK3β with MARK2 Stabilizes the Microtubule Network—In CHOwt cells, the activity of MARK2 leads to drastic morphological changes (13Ebneth A. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1999; 44: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because CHO cells do not have Tau, MARK phosphorylates the related MAP4-like protein at its KXGS sites in the repeat domain and abolishes its microtubule-stabilizing function. As a result, the microtubules breakdown, the cells shrink, and finally die. CHO cells were transfected with constitutively active MARK2 (EYFP-MARK2T208E). After 16 h, cells were fixed and stained for microtubules with antibody YL1/2. Untransfected cells have an extended shape with a clear microtubule network. As expected, transfection of active EYFP-MARK2T208E alone leads to loss of microtubules and shrinkage in 55% of the cells (Fig. 4, upper row, arrows) In contrast, co-expression of both active MARK2 and active GSK3β retains the microtubule network in 60% of the cells (Fig. 4, lower row) indicating that MARK2 is inhibited by GSK3β in these cells"
https://openalex.org/W2025270164,"Complete maturation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein requires coordinate cleavage by signal peptidase and an intramembrane protease, signal peptide peptidase. We show that reducing the intracellular levels of signal peptide peptidase lowers the titer of infectious virus released from cells, indicating that it plays an important role in virus production. Proteolysis by the enzyme at a signal peptide between core and the E1 glycoprotein is needed to permit targeting of core to lipid droplets. From mutagenesis studies, introducing mutations into the core-E1 signal peptide delayed the appearance of signal peptide peptidase-processed core until between 48 and 72 h after the beginning of the infectious cycle. Accumulation of mature core at these times coincided with its localization to lipid droplets and a rise in titer of infectious HCV. Therefore, processing of core by signal peptide peptidase is a critical event in the virus life cycle. To study the stage in virus production that may be blocked by interfering with intramembrane cleavage of core, we examined the distribution of viral RNA in cells harboring the core-E1 signal peptide mutant. Results revealed that colocalization of core with HCV RNA required processing of the protein by signal peptide peptidase. Our findings provide new insights into the sequence requirements for proteolysis by signal peptide peptidase. Moreover, they offer compelling evidence for a function for an intramembrane protease to facilitate the association of core with viral genomes, thereby creating putative sites for assembly of nascent virus particles.

Clin. Pharmacol. 2004; 44: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Chronic HCV infection accounts for a high proportion of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and is therefore a leading cause of liver disease (2Hoofnagle J.H. Hepatology. 2002; 36: S21-S29PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The virus has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that encodes a polyprotein of some 3000 amino acids, which is cleaved both co- and post-translationally by viral and cellular proteases to produce the mature viral proteins (3Penin F. Dubuisson J. Rey F.A. Moradpour D. Pawlotsky J.M. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 4Moradpour D. Penin F. Rice C.M. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The structural components of virus particles lie at the N terminus of the polyprotein and consist of core protein, which forms the virus capsid, and two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2. Maturation of the structural components is directed through cleavage by signal peptidase at signal peptides located between core-E1, E1-E2, and E2-p7 (5Hijikata M. Kato N. Ootsuyama Y. Nakagawa M.

Virol. 1994; 68: 5063-5073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of core protein, complete maturation requires further cleavage within the core-E1 signal peptide by signal peptide peptidase (SPP) (7Hussy P. Langen H. Mous J. Jacobsen H. Virology. 1996; 224: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 8McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This second proteolytic event is required to release core from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, allowing its attachment to storage organelles termed lipid droplets (LDs) (8McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Moreover, cleavage is required for generation of HCV virus-like particles in a system that may reflect the early stages of virion assembly (9Ait-Goughoulte M. Hourioux C. Patient R. Trassard S. Brand D. Roingeard P. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An identical process occurs for maturation of the core proteins encoded by GB virus-B (GBV-B) (10Targett-Adams P. Schaller T. Hope G. Lanford R.E. Lemon S.M. Martin A. McLauchlan J. J. Biol.

Virol. 2006; 80: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a pestivirus that is more distantly related to HCV. In the case of GBV-B, preventing SPP cleavage by mutagenesis of the core-E1 signal peptide blocks both LD attachment of core in tissue culture cells and establishment of a productive infection in tamarins (10Targett-Adams P.

Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15Martoglio B. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R201-R206Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Unlike presenilin, SPP apparently does not require additional cellular cofactors to promote cleavage (16De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 17Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). It is considered that the primary function of SPP is to release signal peptide fragments from the translocon following signal peptidase cleavage (15Martoglio B. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R201-R206Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition, it may have a role in facilitating degradation of incorrectly folded proteins bound to the ER membrane (19Crawshaw S.G. Martoglio B. Meacock S.L. High S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The range of substrates recognized by SPP has not been widely documented but includes the signal peptides of major histocompatability (MHC) class I molecules that bind to HLA-E for presentation on the cell surface (20Lemberg M.K. Bland F.A. Weihofen A. Braud V.M. Martoglio B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6441-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Bland F.A. Lemberg M.K. McMichael A.J. Martoglio B. Braud V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33747-33752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This process is critical for self-nonself recognition because surface expression of peptide-loaded HLA-E is needed to inhibit cell lysis by natural killer cells (22Braud V.M. Allan D.S. O'Callaghan C.A. Soderstrom K. D'Andrea A. Ogg G.S. Lazetic S. Young N.T. Bell J.I. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. McMichael A.J. Nature. 1998; 391: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). In addition, interaction between SPP and the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immunoevasin US2 may promote removal and subsequent degradation of MHC heavy chain molecules attached to the ER (23Loureiro J. Lilley B.N. Spooner E. Noriega V. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2006; 441: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Signal peptides are characterized by a tripartite structure; an N-terminal n-region of 7-13 amino acids that is often polar with a net positive charge, a central hydrophobic h-region of 6-15 amino acids, and a C-terminal c-region, containing polar residues (24Hegde R.S. Bernstein H.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). From in vitro translation studies, using microsomal membranes as a source of SPP, the sequence requirements for cleavage include the presence of small, helix-breaking amino acid residues in the h-region for optimal proteolysis although contributions from flanking sequences in the n- and c-regions also are believed to be important (18Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, deriving a precise consensus motif has not been possible. Initial studies with the core-E1 signal peptide from strain Glasgow identified three amino acids, Ala-180, Ser-183, and Cys-184, within the h-region that were necessary for SPP cleavage (8McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar); subsequent analysis revealed that the contribution of the latter two amino acids was far greater than Ala-180 for efficient proteolysis (18Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The key role played by residues at positions 180, 183, and 184 in core maturation has been confirmed in a second strain (9Ait-Goughoulte M. Hourioux C. Patient R. Trassard S. Brand D. Roingeard P. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In other HCV strains, the role of these amino acids in SPP cleavage has been less clear (26Okamoto K. Moriishi K. Miyamura T. Matsuura Y. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6370-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) although technical differences likely contributes to the different results (27Hope R.G. McElwee M.J. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For the equivalent core-E1 signal peptide in GBV-B, a Ser residue within the h-region, in approximately the same position as Ser-183 in the HCV core-E1 signal peptide, is essential for SPP processing (10Targett-Adams P.

Collectively, the available data indicate that the key residues required for SPP proteolysis lie in the h-region of signal peptides.In this report, we examine the role of SPP proteolysis for production of HCV using the JFH1 strain that releases infectious progeny from tissue culture cells (29Wakita T. Pietschmann T. Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Zhao Z. Murthy K. Habermann A. Krausslich H.G. Mizokami M. Bartenschlager R. Liang T.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar). The key residues involved in SPP maturation of HCV core encoded by this strain also have been identified. Finally, we utilize the properties of a mutant with delayed SPP cleavage to examine the impact of mature core protein on the location of replicated HCV RNA in virus-infected cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—Plasmids pSFV/CE1E2Gla and pSFV/CspmtE1E2Gla have been described previously (8McLauchlan J.

The antibody against SPP was supplied by Abcam.In Vitro Synthesis of RNA and Electroporation of Cells—Wild-type (wt) and mutant pJFH1 constructs were linearized by XbaI digestion and treated with Mung Bean Nuclease (New England BioLabs). To produce SFV RNA encoding the HCV structural proteins, plasmids were digested with SpeI. RNA was synthesized in vitro from linearized plasmids using the MEGAscript high yield transcription kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). Electroporation of RNA into HuH-7 cells was performed as described previously (8McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B.

Prior to infection, medium containing supernatant virus was filtered using a 0.2-μm Minisart filter (Sartorius) and diluted with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At 24-72 h postinoculation, the tissue culture 50% infective dose (TCID50) was determined as described in Lindenbach et al. (35Lindenbach B.D. Evans M.J. Syder A.J. Wolk B. Tellinghuisen T.L.

After washing and blocking with PBS, cells were incubated with primary antibody (diluted in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed extensively with PBS and then incubated with secondary antibody (either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG) conjugated to a fluorescent tag for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, coverslips were rinsed with H2O before mounting on slides using Citifluor (Citifluor Ltd.).Cells were examined with a LSM510 META inverted confocal microscope and images were recorded with a Plan-Apochromat x63 lens (NA 1.4). For three-dimensional reconstructions, Z-stack images were collected using optimum intervals, generating 60-80 slices per sample. Image stacks were deconvolved by three-dimensional blind deconvolution (10 iterations) using Autodeblur software (MediaCybernetics). Three-dimensional reconstructions were created with the 5D-viewer extension in the iso-surface mode using a bin factor of 1.Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—To prepare extracts, cell monolayers were washed with PBS and solubilized in sample buffer (160 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 700 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue) at a concentration of ∼2 × 106 cells/ml sample buffer. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 37.5:1). For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane after separation on polyacrylamide gels. After blocking with PBSA containing 5% milk powder (Marvel), membranes were incubated with the relevant antibody, diluted in PBSA containing 5% milk powder and 0.05% Tween-20. Following extensive washing, the bound antibody was detected using protein A-peroxidase (Sigma) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence.RESULTSReduced Expression of SPP Lowers Production of Infectious HCV—In a recent study of cellular factors that may play a role in HCV replication and virus production, siRNA targeted against SPP reduced production of infectious progeny by 6-fold (36Randall G.

To validate further these data, HuH-7 cells were electroporated with either SPP siRNA or a control siRNA in combination with JFH1 RNA, transcribed in vitro from pJFH1, which contains a full-length, cDNA copy of the virus genome (29Wakita T. Pietschmann T. Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Zhao Z. Murthy K. Habermann A. Krausslich H.G. Mizokami M. Bartenschlager R. Liang T.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar). Compared with results obtained with the control siRNA, levels of SPP were reduced by about 3-fold with the SPP siRNA at 24 h (Fig. 1A). This lower abundance of SPP was maintained at 48 h and decreased further to about 6-fold by 72 h (Fig. 1A). To determine whether lower abundance of SPP affected virus production, virus progeny released from cells was titrated at 24-h intervals after electroporation. At 24-h post-electroporation, there was a modest 2-fold reduction in the titer of virus released from the SPP siRNA-electroporated cells (Fig. 1B). The difference in virus titer was more marked at 48 and 72 h, reaching about 10-fold at both time points (Fig. 1B). These data are in close agreement with the results reported by Randall et al.

Virol. 2006; 87: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Along with the different apparent molecular weights of signal peptidase- and SPP-cleaved core protein on polyacrylamide gels, the ability of core to attach to LDs has proven to be a convenient assay for determining the presence of mature SPP-cleaved protein (8McLauchlan J.

The ASC→ VLV mutant triplet was introduced into the core-E1 signal peptide sequence of JFH1 (JFH1mut1 in Fig. 2A) to test whether they had the same effect on SPP proteolysis in this strain. Initially, the effects of the mutations were examined in the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) vector, SFV1, as this strategy had been employed successfully for other HCV strains (8McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 9Ait-Goughoulte M. Hourioux C. Patient R. Trassard S. Brand D. Roingeard P. J. Gen.

HuH-7 cells were electroporated with in vitro transcribed RNAs from plasmids pSFV/CE1E2JFH1 andpSFV/Cmut1E1E2JFH1, which expressed the wt structural proteins from strain JFH1 and the ASC→ VLV triplet mutation in the core-E1 signal peptide, respectively (Fig. 2A). For comparative purposes, we electroporated cells also with RNAs from pSFV/CE1E2Gla and pSFV/CspmtE1E2Gla, the corresponding wt and ASC→ VLV mutant constructs for strain Glasgow (Fig. 2A). In agreement with our previous studies (8McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 27Hope R.G. McElwee M.J. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), core protein from SFV/CE1E2Gla RNA had a slightly greater mobility compared with the protein produced by SFV/CspmtE1E2Gla RNA (Fig. 2B). This difference in migration arises from the cleavage events used to generate core from the wt (signal peptidase and SPP) and spmt (signal peptidase alone) constructs. The wt form of core from strain Glasgow colocalized with ADRP, a marker for LDs (Fig. 2C, panels vii-ix). By contrast, the signal peptidase-cleaved core product made from SFV/CspmtE1E2Gla RNA had a reticular distribution corresponding to association with the ER membrane, and there was no evidence for attachment to LDs (Fig. 2C, panels x-xii). For core made from SFV/CE1E2JFH1 and SFV/Cmut1E1E2JFH1 RNAs, we found that the protein produced by both constructs co-migrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). In addition, the wt and mutant core species colocalized with ADRP by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2C, panels i-vi), indicating their attachment to LDs. From this evidence, we concluded that the triplet of mutations, ASC→ VLV, were not sufficient to block SPP proteolysis of the core-E1 signal peptide in HCV strain JFH1.FIGURE 2Effect of mutations in the core-E1 signal peptides of HCV strains Glasgow and JFH1 on SPP proteolysis.A, amino acid sequences of wt and mutant core-E1 signal peptides of HCV strains Glasgow and JFH1.

Sequence comparison between the signal peptides of the two strains revealed two amino acid changes at the boundary of the h- and c-regions at positions 185 and 189 (Leu-185 and Ala-189 in strain Glasgow, Ile-185 and Val-189 in strain JFH1; underlined in Fig. 2A). To test whether these amino acids affected the behavior of core made by the ASC→ VLV mutant of JFH1, amino acids at positions 185 and 189 were converted to Leu and Ala, respectively, creating a construct termed pSFV/Cmut2E1E2JFH1 (labeled as JFH1mut2 in Fig. 3A). In this series of experiments, we included also incubation of cells with (Z-LL)2 ketone, an inhibitor of SPP (37Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Friedmann E. Rueeger H. Schmitz A. Paganetti P. Rovelli G.

Since then, biocomputational, informatics, and statistical methods have been used to relate sequences and molecules to diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2072558955,"AP-2 family transcription factors are essential for development and morphogenesis of diverse tissues and organs, but their precise roles in specification of neural crest stem cell (NCSC)-derived cell types have not been determined. Among three members known to be expressed in the NCSC (i.e. AP-2alpha, AP-2beta, and AP-2gamma), we found that only AP-2beta is predominantly expressed in the sympathetic ganglia of developing mouse embryos, supporting its role in sympathetic development. Indeed, AP-2beta null mice expressed significantly reduced levels of both noradrenaline (NA) and NA-synthesizing dopamine beta-hydroxylase in the peripheral nervous system. Strikingly, we also found that NA neuron development was significantly compromised in the locus coeruleus as well. Pharmacological treatment with an NA intermediate during pregnancy significantly rescues the neonatal lethality of AP-2beta(-/-) mice, indicating that NA deficiency is one of the main causes for lethality found in AP-2beta(-/-) mice. We also showed that forced expression of AP-2beta, but not other AP-2 factors, in NCSC favors their differentiation into NA neurons. In summary, we propose that AP-2beta plays critical and distinctive roles in the NA phenotype specification in both the peripheral and central nervous system during development."

This method is also applicable to other major histocompatibility class I epitopes as is shown for two potential epitopes derived from Coxsackievirus. Proteasomes are multisubunit protease complexes that perform most of the non-lysosomal ATP-dependent proteolysis in eukaryotic cells. The 26S proteasome complex is responsible for the degradation of polyubiquitylated proteins and is formed by the so-called 20S proteasome catalytic core that is capped at one or both ends by the 19S regulatory particles (1Rechsteiner M. Hoffman L. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6065-6068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). The catalytic 20S core proteasome itself is responsible for processing of denatured non-ubiquitylated proteins or for further processing of longer peptides of different origin. Overall, products of proteasomal cleavage are peptides of 3–20 amino acids in length (3Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Among these cleavage products are peptides that fulfill the criteria for binding to MHC 2The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; LLO, listeriolysin O; IFNγR, interferon γ receptor; p.i., post infection; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy; LC-ESI, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization; i20S, 20S immunoproteasome; s20S, standard 20S proteasome; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; LLO, listeriolysin O; IFNγR, interferon γ receptor; p.i., post infection; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy; LC-ESI, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization; i20S, 20S immunoproteasome; s20S, standard 20S proteasome; WT, wild type. class I molecules with regard to appropriate length and the correct position of anchor residues. Thus, proteasomes generate the adequate C terminus of most investigated MHC class I ligands, whereas the N terminus is often elongated by two or three residues, requiring N-terminal trimming by amino peptidases to allow efficient binding to MHC class I molecules (4Cascio P.

Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). The two outer rings contain the seven structural α subunits; the two inner rings each contain seven β subunits (β1–β7), of which three (β1, β2, β5) exert catalytic activity. Stimulation of cells with IFN-γ induces the expression of three additional catalytic proteasome subunits. The cytokine-inducible subunits β1i, β2i, and β5i are incorporated into the 20S proteasome core upon its de novo synthesis, thus forming the so-called immunoproteasomes (8Griffin T.A. Nandi D.

Their incorporation alters the catalytic characteristics of the 20S proteasome core. A large number of studies have shown that 20S proteasomes liberate MHC class I epitopes or their N-terminal-elongated precursors out of large polypeptides or denatured proteins in vitro with rates that correlate well with those of the production of antigenic peptides in intact cells (10Sijts A.J.

Furthermore, detailed studies on the functional importance of immunoproteasomes revealed that in particular the generation and presentation of viral epitopes is strongly enhanced in the presence of immunoproteasomes and that their function is tightly connected with the early phases of an antiviral immune response (13Sijts A.J. Standera S. Toes R.E. Ruppert T. Beekman N.J. van Veelen P.A. Ossendorp F.A. Melief C.J. Kloetzel P.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4500-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Chen W.

Recently, we also demonstrated that the efficient presentation of the bacterial Listeriolysin O T-cell epitope LLO(296–304) requires the presence of immunoproteasomes (16Strehl B. Joeris T. Rieger M.

Although the biological relevance of immunoproteasomes for an appropriate cellular immune response gradually emerges, the reason for this at the molecular level is by far less clear. In fact, it appears that, depending on the epitope, immunoproteasomes exert their function quite differently. Immunoproteasomes seem to favor cleavage behind hydrophobic residues, which are the predominant anchor residues required for MHC class I binding of antigenic peptides and thus may explain their positive effect on antigen generation (17Boes B.

On the other hand, there exist an increasing number of examples demonstrating that immunoproteasomes also can down-regulate epitope production by enhanced cleavage within the epitope, i.e. epitope destruction or less efficient liberation (19Morel S.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 3925-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro experiments suggest that immunoproteasomes often degrade substrates considerably faster than their constitutive counterparts. Thus, improved epitope generation might not necessarily be the consequence of altered cleavage specificities but may also be the result of enhanced substrate turnover. The latter argument seems to be supported by the finding that there is, in general, little difference in the overall quality of peptides that are generated by either of the two types of proteasomes (18Toes R.E. Nussbaum A.K. Degermann S. Schirle M. Emmerich N.P. Kraft M. Laplace C. Zwinderman A. Dick T.P. Muller J. Schonfisch B. Schmid C. Fehling H.J. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In consequence, in most in vitro experiments it is difficult to decide whether the observed positive effects of immunoproteasomes on epitope generation are due to an increased substrate turnover or altered cleavage specificity. Based on mass spectrometry and the analysis of the bacterial Listeriolysin O T-cell epitope LLO(296–304) and of three other epitopes, one self- and two virus-derived epitopes, we here report an experimental approach that takes advantage of a substrate-specific non-functional cleavage product, named antitope, that allows one to determine whether predominant generation of a given epitope is due to enhanced substrate turnover or altered cleavage site preference. Proteasome Purification from Infected Mice—20S proteasomes were isolated from tissues of wild-type C57Bl/6 mice as well as of IFN-γ receptor-deficient (IFNγR–/–) mice. Control mice (day 0) or mice infected with 5 × 103 Listeria monocytogenes at days 2, 4, or 6 post infection (p.i.) as indicated in the figures were sacrificed and organs were frozen in liquid nitrogen (16Strehl B.

Further purification steps followed as described (21Kuckelkorn U. Ruppert T. Strehl B. Jungblut P.R. Zimny-Arndt U. Lamer S. Prinz I. Drung I. Kloetzel P.M. Kaufmann S.H. Steinhoff U. J. Exp.

Proteasome Purification from Cells—T2 and T2.27mp cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics under 5% CO2. Proteasomes were isolated from T2 cells for standard proteasomes and from T2.27mp cells that stably express all three immunosubunits for immunoproteasomes. Proteasome isolation was performed as described previously (22Kuckelkorn U. Ferreira E.A. Drung I. Liewer U. Kloetzel P.M. Theobald M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1368-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The proteasome was measured at 280 nm and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The yield was calculated at ∼90–95%. Equal amounts of proteasome in assays were adjusted by densitometry of proteasomes in Coomassie-stained gels. Incorporation of immunosubunits was controlled by two-dimensional PAGE and Coomassie staining for proteasomes isolated from liver and small intestines (16Strehl B. Joeris T. Rieger M. Visekruna A.

Peptides—Peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) methodology (0.1 mmol) on an Applied Biosystems 433A automated synthesizer. The peptides were purified by HPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry (ABI Voyager DE PRO). In Vitro Peptide Digest—To determine proteasome-mediated processing of a synthetic model peptide, 3 μg of a 27-mer peptide derived from Listeriolysin O (LLO(291–317)) (AYISSVAYGRQV YLKLSTNSHSTKVKA) was incubated at 37 °C for 2 and 4 h with 1 μg of isolated 20S proteasomes in 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.8, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Further, 2.5 μg of peptide derived from murine Hsp60(171–200) (VATISANGDKDIGNIISD AMKKVGRKGVIT) and 3 μg each of peptides derived from Coxsackievirus B3 Nancy (CVB3) core protein P2C(1161–1190) (ATIEQSAPSQSDQE QLFSNVQYFAHYCRKY) and RNA-directed RNA polymerase P3D(2158–2185) (RKIRSVPVGR CLTLPAFSTLRRKWLDSF) that were predicted by the SYFPEITHI data base (23Rammensee H. Bachmann J. Emmerich N.P. Bachor O.A. Stevanovic S. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar) were incubated with 1 μg of proteasomes at 37 °C for the indicated time. Adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.3% stopped the reactions. Peptide Identification, Quantification, and Statistical Analysis—Peptides generated by proteasomes were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC, system HP1100 (Hewlett-Packard) equipped with an RPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column (GE Healthcare). Analysis was performed online with an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source (ThermoQuest) (21Kuckelkorn U. Ruppert T. Strehl B. Jungblut P.R. Zimny-Arndt U. Lamer S.

In Fig. 3, A and B, the kinetic of one representative digest is shown. For analyses of linearity of peptide signals in LC-ESI, different amounts of LLO precursor and epitope peptides were separated on HPLC followed by LC-ESI ion trap MS. For statistical analysis of the LLO and the Hsp60 peptides, ion counts were normalized to the 9GPS standard peptide, which was added in equal amounts to each stopped reaction and the mass of which does not interfere with the masses of any proteasomal cleavage products of analyzed peptides. For LLO(291–317) and Hsp60(171–200) four replicates were averaged each. Statistical significance was attributed to differences in one-tailed, heteroscedastic t-test (p < 0.05) or in the non-parametric Mann-Whitney t-test (p < 0.05). The processing of CVB3-derived peptides P2C(1161–1190) and P3D(2158–2185) was repeated two and three times, respectively. To determine whether immunoproteasomes display increased cleavage site preference, the generation of indicated antitopes that excludes processing of the correct epitopes was used as reference. Ion counts of the antitope were set as 1 in each reaction, and relative amount of corresponding epitope or precursor to the antitope was calculated (means are shown). The analyzed antitope sequences used are indicated in Figs. 1C, 4A, and 5A.FIGURE 4Murine Hsp60 epitope generation is independent of i20S proteasomes.

Such an effect could be the result of either an overall faster substrate turnover rate or of altered cleavage site preferences of i20S proteasomes that favor the liberation of the epitopes. Immunoproteasomes Exhibit a Faster Substrate Turnover Rate—To distinguish between the two above possibilities we used identical amounts of purified s20S and i20S proteasomes for in vitro processing assays and analyzed the turnover rates of LLO-derived 27-mer polypeptides that harbor the LLO(296–304) T-cell epitope. As shown in Fig. 1A, i20S proteasomes isolated from T2 cells that were transfected with immunosubunits (T2.27mp) as well as from liver of Listeria-infected mice reveal a significantly accelerated degradation of the polypeptide substrate. Analysis of substrate turnover by s20S proteasomes from liver of uninfected control mice (WT) and i20S proteasomes from liver of Listeria-infected mice again showed an accelerated substrate turnover by i20S proteasomes (Fig. 1B). In contrast, 20S proteasomes isolated from livers of IFNR–/– mice lacking i20S proteasomes (supplemental Fig. S1) exhibit a diminished substrate degradation rate. This demonstrates that the increased substrate turnover rates are indeed due to i20S proteasomes (Fig. 1B). Importantly, accelerated substrate degradation by i20S-proteasomes is not restricted to the LLO-derived 27-mer polypeptide but is also observed for epitope-containing polypeptides of other origins (Figs. 4B and 5B). To study whether the quality of peptides generated from LLO 27-mer polypeptides differ between s20S and i20S proteasomes, the peptide fragments generated by the two proteasome types were compared (Fig. 1C). No major differences in the quality of peptides generated by either subtype were observed. Only two additional fragments were identified by mass spectrometry in digests with i20S proteasomes. However, both resulted from the usage of cleavage sites that are in common with those of s20S proteasomes. Remarkably, with the cleavage at Val-12 ↓ Tyr-13 we detected a strong cleavage site within the epitope whose usage could be crucial for the amount of epitope or epitope precursor peptides generated (Fig. 1C). The peptide fragment Ser-4-Val-12 resulting from cleavage at Val-12 ↓ Tyr-13 possesses an N-terminal residue (Ser-4) identical to the one of the longest epitope precursor peptide but lacks the correct C terminus of the LLO epitope. We therefore decided to use this peptide fragment (Ser-4-Val-12) as suitable internal standard for the calculation of relative cleavage site preference. Because this peptide fragment precluded the generation of a functional MHC class I epitope it was named antitope. To determine relative amounts of proteasome-generated peptide fragments by semiquantitative mass spectrometric analysis, an interference of peptides of interest must be excluded. For example, more efficient ionization of one peptide may result in better detection compared with another poorly ionized peptide although identical or even less absolute amounts are generated by the proteasome. Therefore, we first demonstrated the linearity between ion current and peptide amount in the range of up to 200 pmol for the 27-mer substrate, both epitopes (Val-6-Leu-14; Ala-7-Leu-14), the precursor peptide Ser-4-Leu-14, and the antitope Ser-4-Val-12. As shown in Fig. 2, all peptides reveal a peptide concentration-dependent linearity whereby the absolute intensities differ between the peptides. In consequence, an increase in the relative ratio of ESI-MS intensity between two of these peptides will be due to an increase in the relative ratio of respective peptide amounts. Furthermore, possible interferences between peptides in complex mixtures may quench the signal. Therefore, we analyzed the same peptides in different mixtures containing different ratios of the peptides. Although we observed interferences between the peptides and also a decrease in ion intensities, the mass/signal ratios between the peptides remained the same (data not shown). Cleavage Site Preference or Degradation Rate—Using the antitope as defined above as internal substrate-specific standard, we next investigated whether observed enhanced liberation of a T-cell epitope by i20S proteasomes is due to an i20S proteasome-dependent higher substrate degradation rate or the result of altered cleavage site usage. To test this, the LLO-derived 27-mer polypeptide was digested with s20S liver proteasomes of uninfected control mice and with i20S liver proteasomes of Listeria-infected mice. As shown in Fig. 3A, i20S proteasomes isolated from livers 2 and 6 days post infection generated both the Ser-4-Leu-14 precursor fragment and the epitope Ala-7-Leu-14 with increased efficiency. Similarly, the generation of the antitope increased significantly (Fig. 3B). We next calculated the relative ratios of generated antitope Ser-4-Val-12, lacking correct C-terminal cleavage, versus the relative amount of the generated T-cell epitope and precursor. The data shown in Fig. 3C demonstrate that the more efficient generation of both the LLO epitope and the precursor peptides is due to significantly enhanced cleavage site usage of Leu-14 ↓ Lys-15 by i20S proteasomes compared with the cleavage at Val-12 ↓ Tyr-13. Remarkably, the usage of both analyzed N-terminal cleavage sites is also enhanced by i20S proteasomes, suggesting that the precursor, the antitope, and the epitope are generated by concerted dual cleavages (Fig. 3A). These data also demonstrate that frequently observed cleavages within an epitope do not necessarily have to result in a concomitant down-regulation of epitope production. To control that the observed up-regulation is not a side effect of liver i20S proteasomes in infected mice, we also tested proteasomes from small intestines that constitutively contain high levels of i20S proteasomes that are not further increased after infection (16Strehl B. Joeris T. Rieger M. Visekruna A. Textoris-Taube K. Kaufmann S.H. Kloetzel P.M. Kuckelkorn U. Steinhoff U. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6238-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and 20S proteasomes isolated from livers of infected IFNR–/–-deficient mice that contain mainly standard proteasomes. As shown in Fig. 3D, the elevated epitope/antitope and precursor/antitope ratios in digest with small intestine proteasomes is not changed during the infection and no elevation of the epitope/antitope and precursor/antitope ratio was observed in IFNR–/–-deficient mice that produce only negligible amounts of i20S proteasomes (supplemental Fig. S1). To further assess the strength of the antitope approach, we extended our study to three other substrates and generated epitopes of different origin. Previous data had indicated that the generation of the murine Hsp60 epitope is not affected by i20S proteasomes. Digestion of a murine Hsp60-derived 30-mer polypeptide containing the epitope resulted in the generation of the correct T-cell epitope (Lys-10-Asp-18), a precursor peptide (Ser-5-Asp-18), and an antitope (Ser-5-Ile-16), the latter being the result of cleavage between Ile-16 ↓ Ser-17 (Fig. 4A). As observed for the LLO substrate, degradation of the Hsp60 30-mer polypeptide is considerably accelerated in the presence of i20S proteasomes (Fig. 4B). Concomitant with the enhanced degradation rate, the production of the epitope (Lys-10-Asp-18), the precursor peptide (Ser-5-Asp-18), and the antitope (Ser-5-Ile-16) is also enhanced by i20S proteasomes from Listeria-infected mice livers or from small intestine (Fig. 4C). However, standardization of the Hsp60 epitope and precursor peptides against the Hsp60 antitope reveals that there is no change in the preference of cleavage site usage by i20S proteasomes (Fig. 4D). Thus, in contrast to the LLO epitope, increased Hsp60 epitope generation is closely connected with accelerated substrate turnover. In the last set of experiments we studied the generation of two predicted viral MHC class I epitopes derived from proteins of the Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) (Fig. 5A). Again, i20S proteasomes reveal an accelerated turnover of both the CVB3 P2C- and CVB3 P3D-derived polypeptide substrates (Fig. 5B). Despite the fact that the differences in epitope precursor and antitope production by i20S proteasomes or s20S proteasomes are not striking (Fig. 5C), standardization with the CVB3 P2C antitope Gln-13-Tyr-22 demonstrates that immunoproteasomes exhibit a clear preference for the usage of the correct C-terminal Phe-23 ↓ Ala-24 cleavage site compared with C-terminal cleavage at Tyr-22 ↓ Phe-23 and the generation of antitope (Fig. 5D). In slight contrast to the data obtained with the P2C polypeptide, we detected two antitopes in the P3D-derived polypeptide (Fig. 5A). One of them possesses the same N-terminal residue as the epitope (Thr-13-Phe-17). Determination of the ratio between the produced epitope (Thr-13-Leu-20) versus the corresponding antitope shows a strong preference for cleavage behind the C-terminal residue of the epitope by i20S proteasomes (Fig. 5, E and F). The other antitope (Pro-15-Leu-20) was used as additional internal standard (Fig. 5, A and E). This peptide possesses the C-terminal residue of the epitope and precursor (Leu-20), whereas the N terminus of the peptide is generated by an epitope destroying cleavage between Leu-14 ↓ Pro-15. Normalization of the generated epitope against the peptide Pro-15-Leu-20 (Fig. 5F) indicates that the generation of the correct N terminus of the epitope is also enhanced in the presence of i20S proteasomes. The experiments shown in Fig. 5F demonstrate that the antitope approach can also be applied for the determination of relative N-terminal cleavage site usage. Previous in vitro analyses have shown that the presence of immunosubunits can alter the preference of proteasomal cleavage site usage in a given substrate, implying this to be the major reason for the frequently observed increase of i20S proteasome-dependent antigen presentation. In fact, in most cases studied (both in cells and in vitro) this conclusion seemed to be supported by the observed increase in i20S proteasome-dependent specific MHC class I antigen presentation. However, the finding that substrate degradation in vitro is in many cases accelerated in the presence of i20S proteasomes also raised the possibility that a general increase in peptide quantity due to enhanced substrate turnover may also serve as valid explanation for improved antigen presentation. Thus, only if there exists a clear yes or no answer for the i20S proteasome dependence of an epitope, as has been shown for the hepatitus B virus core antigen and others, is a conclusion concerning cleavage site preferences straightforward (10Sijts A.J.

Regarding the hepatitus B virus core antigen it became for the first time evident that incorporation of immunosubunits induces structural changes in the 20S proteasome core and that alterations in cleavage site preference do not necessarily require a novel catalytic site (10Sijts A.J. Ruppert T. Rehermann B. Schmidt M. Koszinowski U. Kloetzel P.M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, in most cases it remained difficult to distinguish whether improved CD8+ T-cell epitope presentation is due to increased substrate turnover or to specifically enhanced generation of the epitope itself. Part of the problem is inherent to mass spectrometry, which does not allow differential quantification of proteasomal peptide products. Studying the generation of the Listeria LLO epitope we were faced with exactly this problem. In vivo experiments showed that i20S proteasomes enhanced the presentation of the LLO(297–304) (Ala-7-Leu-14) epitope in target cells; in agreement with this, in vitro digests revealed an apparently preferential generation of the LLO epitope or its precursor Ser-4-Leu-14 (LLO(294–304)) peptides. The fact that i20S proteasomes degraded the LLO substrate much faster than standard proteasomes made it, however, difficult to discern whether improved epitope generation is due to altered C-terminal cleavage site preference or to accelerated turnover of the LLO substrate. We therefore analyzed the generation of a substrate-specific, but epitope-independent, peptide that is cleaved by both standard and immunoproteasomes and thus competes with the generation of a functional epitope. As such, we first defined the Ser-4-Val-12 (LLO(294–302)) peptide as an antitope whose generation is due a cleavage within the epitope. Interestingly, i20S proteasomes from T2.27 cells or from the liver of infected mice also generated the antitope with increased efficiency. Similar observations from other antigens, i.e. cleavage within the epitope sequence, were previously interpreted as being a sign for preferential epitope destruction by immunoproteasomes. However, when the amount of LLO epitope and precursor was normalized in correlation to the amount of antitope generated by both s20S and i20S proteasomes, it became evident that the correct C-terminal cleavage was enhanced in the presence of i20S proteasomes by a factor of approximately three in comparison to the antitope. Thus, the increased production of the LLO(294–304) T-cell epitope by i20S proteasomes was indeed the consequence of altered C-terminal cleavage site usage and not a consequence of accelerated substrate turnover. Our experiments also show that utilization of an antitope peptide for the discrimination of proteasomal cleavage site preferences is not restricted to the LLO substrate but can be extended to other epitopes, as demonstrated here for the two CVB3-derived epitopes, i.e. P2C and P3D. For P3D, two antitope peptides could be selected for cleavage site analysis. One of the antitope peptides shared the N-terminal residue and the other peptide the C-terminal residue with epitope sequence. In consequence, the partial overlap of the antitope with the C and N termini of the epitope allowed the determination of the cleavage site preference for either the C-terminal or N-terminal cleavage required for epitope liberation. An important and often neglected issue is that enhanced C-terminal cleavage alone as usually assigned to i20S proteasomes does not sufficiently explain the improved epitope liberation, because this also requires a concomitant N-terminal cleavage. As such, the widespread opinion that immunoproteasomes support epitope generation due to their capacity to cleave more efficiently behind hydrophobic, i.e. potential anchor residues, falls short of the real requirements for antigen processing. The analysis of the LLO substrate revealed that i20S proteasomes also enhance N-terminal cleavage. Increased and coordinated dual cleavage events were previously shown for the function of PA28/20S proteasome complexes, whereby PA28 seems to induce subtle structural changes on the 20S core proteasomes without affecting the active site themselves (26Textoris-Taube K. Henklein P. Pollmann S. Bergann T. Weisshoff H. Seifert U. Drung I. Mugge C. Sijts A. Kloetzel P.M. Kuckelkorn U. J. Biol.

In addition, induction of structural changes by the β5i subunit was shown to result in altered cleavage site preferences of the 20S proteasome core complex. It is unclear how far double cleavage events by i20S proteasomes and those induced by PA28 are mechanistically related, but it is interesting to note that apparently both the IFN-induced i20S proteasomes and PA28 exert structural changes onto the 20S core that allow for more efficient double cleavage events and concomitant enhanced epitope production.

https://openalex.org/W2082287697,"Oxygen-dependent ubiquitination of the α-subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-α) by the (von Hippel-Lindau protein)-Elongin B/C-Cullin2-Rbx1 (VBC-Cul2) ubiquitin ligase, a member of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), plays a central role in controlling oxygen metabolism. Nedd8 conjugation of cullins enhances the ligase activity of CRLs, and the COP9/signalosome (CSN) enhances the degradation of several CRL substrates, although it removes Nedd8 from cullins. Here we demonstrate that CSN increased the efficiency of the VBC-Cul2 complex for recognizing and ubiquitinating substrates by facilitating the dissociation of ubiquitinated substrates from the pVHL subunit of the complex. Moreover CSN enhanced HIF-1α degradation by promoting the dissociation of HIF-1α from pVHL in cells. The length of the polyubiquitin chain conjugated to the substrate appeared to be involved in CSN-mediated dissociation of the substrate from pVHL. In contrast to other mechanisms underlying CSN-mediated activation of CRLs, the dissociation of ubiquitinated substrates from pVHL did not require the deneddylation activity of CSN, implying that CSN enhances degradation of CRL substrates by multiple mechanisms."
