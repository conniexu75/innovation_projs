https://openalex.org/W1966667742,The potassium channels encoded by the Drosophila Shaker gene activate and inactivate rapidly when the membrane potential becomes more positive. Site-directed mutagenesis and single-channel patch-clamp recording were used to explore the molecular transitions that underlie inactivation in Shaker potassium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. A region near the amino terminus with an important role in inactivation has now been identified. The results suggest a model where this region forms a cytoplasmic domain that interacts with the open channel to cause inactivation.
https://openalex.org/W2022971724,"The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) protein contains a region of significant sequence similarity to ras p21 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and the yeast IRA1 gene product. A fragment of NF1 cDNA encoding the GAP-related domain (NF1 GRD) was expressed, immunoaffinity purified, and assayed for effects on N-ras p21 GTPase activity. The GTPase of wild-type ras p21 was stimulated by NF1 GRD, but oncogenic mutants of ras p21 (Asp-12 and Val-12) were unaffected, and the GTPase of an effector mutant (Ala-38) was only weakly stimulated. NF1 GRD also down-regulated RAS function in S. cerevisiae. The affinity of NF1 GRD for ras p21 was estimated to be 250 nM: this is more than 20-fold higher than the affinity of GAP for ras p21. However, its specific activity was about 30 times lower. These kinetic measurements suggest that NF1 may be a significant regulator of ras p21 activity, particularly at low ras p21 concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2134732424,"We report here that the bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxin induces human blood monocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner to release prodigious amounts of prostaglandins with thromboxane A2, the major metabolite formed. Cells responded to as little as 1 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide to release prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane A2 with maximal stimulation at 10 micrograms/ml. Lipopolysaccharide was found to induce increased activity of cyclooxygenase enzyme without affecting the activities of phospholipase and thromboxane synthase or the formation of 5-lipoxygenase products (e.g. leukotriene B4). The glucocorticoid dexamethasone completely blocked the lipopolysaccharide-induced prostanoid release by inhibiting the activity of monocyte cyclooxygenase. Dexamethasone did not affect phospholipase and thromboxane synthase activities or leukotriene formation. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled cyclooxygenase confirmed that the effect of lipopolysaccharide and dexamethasone on the monocyte prostanoid production could be attributed to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cellular cyclooxygenase de novo synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1971602793,"The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis locus, NF1, encodes a protein with homology restricted to the catalytic region of the RAS GTPase-activating protein, GAP, and with extensive homology to the IRA1 and IRA2 gene products of the yeast S. cerevisiae. A segment of the NF1 cDNA gene, expressed in yeast, can complement loss of IRA function and can inhibit both wild-type and mutant activated human H-ras genes that are coexpressed in yeast. Yeast expressing the NF1 segment have increased H-ras GTPase-stimulating activity. These studies indicate that the NF1 gene product can interact with RAS proteins and demonstrate structural and functional similarities and differences among the GAP, IRA1, IRA2, and NF1 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1969870358,"Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have suggested a model for the inactivation mechanism of Shaker potassium channels from Drosophila melanogaster. In this model, the first 20 amino acids form a cytoplasmic domain that interacts with the open channel to cause inactivation. The model was tested by the internal application of a synthetic peptide, with the sequence of the first 20 residues of the ShB alternatively spliced variant, to noninactivating mutant channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The peptide restored inactivation in a concentration-dependent manner. Like normal inactivation, peptide-induced inactivation was not noticeably voltage-dependent. Trypsin-treated peptide and peptides with sequences derived from the first 20 residues of noninactivating mutants did not restore inactivation. These results support the proposal that inactivation occurs by a cytoplasmic domain that occludes the ion-conducting pore of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W1549591697,"We find that the reticulocyte lipoxygenase can oxygenate rat liver mitochondrial membranes, beef heart submitochondrial particles, rat liver endoplasmic membranes, and erythrocyte plasma membranes (inside-out and right side-out ghosts) without prior action of a phospholipase. After alkaline hydrolysis of the ester lipids, the main products were identified as 15S-hydro(pero)xy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetr aenoic acid, 17S-hydro(pero)xy-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,15E, 19Z,-docosahexaenoic acid, 13S-hydro(pero)xy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid, 9(S/R)-hydro(pero)xy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid as well as the two all-E hydro(pero)xy octadecadienoic acid isomers. At low membrane concentrations (1 mg of protein/ml), the enzyme maintains a high stereospecificity for the S-configuration, but at higher concentrations (20 mg/ml), the products were virtually racemic. Addition of the antioxidant 2,6-ditert-butyl-p-cresol counteracted this tendency to lose stereospecificity. During these enzyme-catalyzed reactions, substantially more oxygen is consumed than can be accounted for as the hydro(pero)xy products. This discrepancy is due to secondary reactions which lead to the decomposition of the primary oxygenation products, the hydroperoxy lipids, and to oxidative modifications of membrane proteins. These data indicate that the reticulocyte lipoxygenase can oxygenate polyenoic fatty acids in various types of biological membrane and that the oxidative modifications are not restricted to the membrane lipids. The results are discussed in terms of the proposed role of the enzyme in the breakdown of mitochondria and other intracellular organelles during the maturation of red blood cells."
https://openalex.org/W1563058663,"In this report, we have identified two apolipoproteins (apo), apoD and apoA-IV, that, together with the previously identified apoA-I and apoE, accumulate in the regenerating peripheral nerve. These four apolipoproteins were identified in regenerating rat sciatic nerves by their molecular weights, their isoelectric points, and their recognition by specific antibodies. Antibodies were also used to document the changing concentrations of these apolipoproteins in homogenates of regenerating sciatic nerves collected 1 day to 6 weeks after a denervating crush injury. By 3 weeks after injury, at their peak accumulation, apoA-IV and apoA-I had increased 14- and 26-fold, respectively, relative to their concentrations in the normal nerve. Apolipoproteins D and E, in contrast, increased over 500- and 250-fold, respectively, by 3 weeks. These same apolipoproteins also accumulated in the regenerating sciatic nerves of two other species, the rabbit and the marmoset monkey. Immunocytochemistry showed that apoD was produced by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the normal central nervous system, and by neurolemmal or fibroblastic cells in the normal peripheral nervous system. Metabolic labeling of both apoD and apoE by [35S]methionine during an in vitro incubation of regenerating rat sciatic nerve segments confirmed that these apolipoproteins are synthesized by the nerve. Neither apoA-IV nor apoA-I was metabolically labeled, however, suggesting that they enter the nerve from the plasma. The results from this study provide evidence that several different apolipoproteins from various sources may play a role in lipid transport within neural tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1902547891,"There are spectral and biochemical data suggesting that a tyrosine group(s) is involved in the cyclooxygenase reaction catalyzed by prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase. Treatment with tetranitromethane, a reagent which nitrates tyrosine residues, abolishes cyclooxygenase activity, but this inactivation can be largely prevented by competitive cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as ibuprofen and indomethacin. To identify sites of nitration, native PGH synthase and indomethacin-pretreated PGH synthase were incubated with tetranitromethane, and the sequences of peptides containing nitrotyrosine were determined. Three unique tyrosines (Tyr-355, Tyr-385, and Tyr-417) were nitrated in the native enzyme but not in the indomethacin-treated PGH synthase. Using site-directed mutagenesis of sheep PGH synthase, each of these tyrosines, as well as two other tyrosine residues selected as controls (Tyr-254 and Tyr-262), were replaced with phenylalanine; cos-1 cells were transfected with constructs containing cDNAs coding for the native PGH synthase and each of the five phenylalanine mutants, and microsomes from these cells were assayed for cyclooxygenase and hydroperoxidase activities. The Phe-385 mutant of PGH synthase lacked cyclooxygenase activity but retained peroxidase activity; all other mutants expressed both enzyme activities. Our results establish that Tyr-385 is essential for the cyclooxygenase activity of PGH synthase and that nitration of this residue can be prevented by indomethacin. We conclude that Tyr-385 is at or near the cyclooxygenase active site of PGH synthase and could be the tyrosine residue proposed to be involved in the first step of the cyclooxygenase reaction, abstraction of the 13-proS hydrogen from arachidonate."

https://openalex.org/W2046617996,"We report here that transport of the protein product of the c-fos proto-oncogene from the cytoplasm, where it is synthesized, into the nucleus, where it operates as part of the AP-1 transcription complex, is not spontaneous but depends on the continuous stimulation of cells by serum factors. A labile protein inhibitor of transport, the effect of which is reversed by cAMP, is responsible for retention of c-Fos protein within the cytoplasm of serum-starved fibroblasts. In contrast, v-Fos proteins transduced by the murine retroviruses FBJ and FBR, which remain nuclear in the absence of serum, evade the translocation control, which therefore appears to contribute to their tumorigenic potential."

https://openalex.org/W1522007155,"Novel G protein alpha subunits were purified from rat brain by an affinity matrix containing immobilized beta gamma subunits (Pang, I.-H., and Sternweis, P. C. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 7814-7818). They were unique based on the following criteria. These alpha subunits migrated differently through polyacrylamide gels with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa. They did not behave similarly to the other brain G proteins by conventional chromatographic techniques. Antisera raised against a common region of known alpha subunits failed to recognize these 42-kDa polypeptides. Finally, primary sequences of tryptic fragments of these proteins contain regions homologous to, yet unique from, the other alpha subunits. Sequences are identical with one or more members of a new family of alpha subunits recently identified by molecular genetic techniques (Strathmann, M., Wilke, T. M., and Simon, M. I. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 7407-7409); most of the primary sequence identifies an alpha subunit labeled alpha q. These polypeptides were not substrates for ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by pertussis toxin. They bound GTP gamma S only with slow rates and low stoichiometry. Antisera to peptides based on primary sequence were specific for the new alpha subunits and indicate that they are widely distributed at low levels in different tissues but more concentrated in brain and lung. This procedure provides a means of preparing native G proteins that have a potential role as modulators of pertussis toxin-insensitive regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1606421683,"Cholate-solubilized extracts from bovine liver plasma membranes preincubated with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) displayed enhanced phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity compared with extracts from membranes incubated without nucleotide or with ATP or GDP analog. Resolution of the GTP gamma S-elicited activator of phospholipase C was achieved using heparin-Sepharose which bound the phospholipase C activity. Recombination of non-adsorbed extract with salt-eluted phospholipase C activity resulted in a stimulation of enzyme activity. The GTP gamma S-dependent activator was purified, on the basis of its ability to activate partially purified phospholipase C, by sequential chromatography on Q-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-300, octyl-Sepharose, and Mono Q. The presence of G-protein beta subunits and the alpha subunits of Gi1, Gi2, and Gi3 was detected, by immunoblot analysis, in Mono Q-purified phospholipase C activator preparations. Resolution of the activator from these alpha subunits was achieved by incubation with pertussis toxin in the presence of millimolar NAD+ followed by rechromatography on Mono Q. The phospholipase C activator, thus resolved from ADP-ribosylated alpha i subunits, possessed an approximate Mr of 42 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and copurified with a substoichiometric amount of beta subunit. Immunoblot analysis of fractions from the final Mono Q column revealed cross-reactivity of the 42-kDa phospholipase C activator with antipeptide antibodies raised against residues 160-169 of alpha i1 and a region of sequence common to all known G-protein alpha subunits. The 42-kDa activator was not recognized by other alpha subunit-specific or common antibodies. These findings identify the purified phospholipase C activator as a novel G-protein alpha subunit. This may represent the active subunit of the pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein mediating receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown in mammalian liver."

https://openalex.org/W2053275476,"Most immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes express only a small number of T cell receptor (TCR) molecules on their surface, and the TCR molecules they do express are only marginally capable of transducing intracellular signals. TCR expression and function was not intrinsically low in immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, but was found to be actively inhibited by CD4-mediated signals. Indeed, release of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes from CD4-mediated signals resulted in significant increases in both TCR expression and signaling function. These results suggest that, in CD4+CD8+ cells developing in the thymus, increased TCR expression and function requires release from CD4-mediated inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1522902447,"The repressor gene (lacR) of the lactose phosphotransferase system of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strain MG1820 has been cloned and characterized. Transcription of lacR, into a 1.2-kilobase monocistronic messenger, is repressed approximately 5-fold during growth on lactose. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the lacR gene showed the presence of an open reading frame of 861 base pairs. The deduced amino acid sequence of LacR is homologous to three Escherichia coli regulatory proteins (DeoR, FucR, and GutR) and includes a N-terminal domain (helix-turn-helix) involved in DNA binding and a C-terminal domain that may be responsible for inducer binding. The in vivo function of LacR has been determined by introducing multiple copies of lacR into L. lactis, under control of its own or the unrelated prtP promoter. Growth rates and lactose phosphotransferase system enzyme activities were measured during growth on lactose and glucose. The presence of lacR on a multicopy plasmid resulted in the decrease of lactose phosphotransferase system activity, whereas only on lactose a decrease (25%) of growth rate was observed. No significant difference in growth rate was observed on glucose, indicating that LacR specifically represses the lactose genes of L. lactis."
https://openalex.org/W2021131210,"The segment of the malarial circumsporozoite (CS) protein designated Region II is highly conserved among different malarial species. A similar sequence is also present in several other proteins, including thrombospondin, properdin, and a blood-stage antigen of Plasmodium falciparum. By means of peptides synthesized from sequences of the Plasmodium vivax CS protein in the vicinity of Region II, it was found that two overlapping 18- to 20-amino acid peptides promoted the adhesion of a variety of human hematopoietic cell lines. The amino acid sequence valine-threonine-cysteineglycine (VTCG), contained within this common motif, was shown to be the critical sequence for the observed cell-adhesive properties."
https://openalex.org/W2001013796,"Gs and Gi2 are G proteins whose alpha subunits are 65% homologous. Within the 355 amino acid alpha i2 polypeptide, substitution of residues Ile213-Lys319 with the corresponding alpha s region (Ile235-Arg356) generated a chimera that activated adenylyl cyclase, indicating that the alpha s activation domain resides within this 122 amino acid alpha s sequence. Mutation within alpha s residues Glu15-Pro144 resulted in an alpha s polypeptide having an enhanced rate of GDP dissociation. Mutation within two regions of the N-terminus influenced the ability of pertussis toxin to ADP-ribosylate the alpha subunit polypeptide, a reaction controlled by the beta gamma subunit complex. The findings define the G protein alpha subunit N-terminus as a regulatory region controlling beta gamma subunit interactions and GDP dissociation independent of the GTPase and effector activation domains."
https://openalex.org/W1566568260,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase specifically recognizes DNA strand breaks by its DNA-binding domain. DNA binding activates the enzyme to catalyze the formation of poly(ADP-ribose) utilizing NAD as substrate. By a molecular genetic approach we set out to inhibit this enzyme activity in a highly specific manner, thus avoiding the inherent side effects of NAD analogs which have been used extensively as enzyme inhibitors. cDNA sequences coding for the human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase DNA-binding domain were subcloned into eucaryotic expression plasmids and transiently transfected into monkey cells. Cells were fixed with ethanol followed by incubation with NAD. Indirect double immunofluorescence to detect both overexpressed protein and poly(ADP-ribose) in situ revealed that overexpression of the DNA-binding domain greatly inhibited poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation catalyzed by the resident enzyme during NAD postincubation. The same inhibition was observed when transfected cells were treated with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine to induce DNA strand breaks in vivo and subjected to trichloroacetic acid/ethanol fixation and subsequent immunofluorescence analysis, a novel method we developed for the in situ detection of polymer synthesis in intact cells. This molecular genetic approach may prove to be a selective and efficient tool to investigate possible functions of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in living cells."

https://openalex.org/W1535685087,"The predicted amino acid sequences for the Gi alpha 1 and G gamma 6 subunits of brain heterotrimeric G-proteins both contain C-terminal Cys-A-A-X elements (A is an aliphatic residue and X is any amino acid). This domain represents the site of Cys thioether modification by isoprenoids in p21ras, nuclear lamins, and fungal mating factors. We now show that G gamma 6, translated in reticulocyte lysate, is efficiently labeled with the isoprenoid precursor, [3H]mevalonate. Alteration of the sequence of G gamma 6 so that a Gly was substituted for Cys in the C-terminal Cys-A-A-X element rendered the protein incapable of undergoing isoprenoid modification. In contrast to G gamma 6, the Gi alpha 1 subunit did not appear to undergo isoprenylation when translated in reticulocyte lysate. Transient expression of the protein in COS cells, which were able to isoprenylate the p21 product of transfected H-ras, also failed to demonstrate isoprenylation of Gi alpha 1. The modification of the gamma subunit by a hydrophobic moiety may have important implications for the assembly of the brain G-protein beta gamma complexes into the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1481707214,"Biochemical, immunological, and sequence analyses demonstrated that the glucose permease of Bacillus subtilis, the glucose-specific Enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, is a single polypeptide chain with a C-terminal Enzyme III-like domain. A flexible hydrophilic linker, similar in length and amino acid composition to linkers previously identified in other regulatory or sensory transducing proteins, functions to tether the Enzyme IIIGlc-like domain of the protein to the membrane-embedded Enzyme IIGlc. Evidence is presented demonstrating that the Enzyme IIIGlc-like domain of the glucose permease plays a dual role and functions in the transport and phosphorylation of both glucose and sucrose. The sucrose permease appears to lack a sucrose-specific Enzyme III-like domain or a separate, soluble IIIScr protein. Enzyme IIScr was capable of utilizing the IIIGlc-like domain of the glucose permease regardless of whether the IIIGlc polypeptide was provided as a purified, soluble protein, as a membrane-bound protein within the same membrane as Enzyme IIScr, or as a membrane-bound protein within membrane fragments different from those bearing Enzyme IIScr. These observations suggest that the IIIGlc-like domain is an autonomous structural unit that assumes a conformation independent of the hydrophobic, N-terminal intramembranal domain of Enzyme IIGlc. Preferential uptake and phosphorylation of glucose over sucrose has been demonstrated by both in vivo transport studies and in vitro phosphorylation assays. Addition of the purified IIIGlc-like domain strongly stimulated the phosphorylation of sucrose, but not that of glucose, in phosphorylation assays that contained the two sugars simultaneously. The results suggest that the preferential uptake of glucose over sucrose is determined by competition of the corresponding sugar-specific permeases for the common P approximately IIIGlc/Scr domain."
https://openalex.org/W1555246248,"Mutations in the insulin receptor gene can compromise the ability of the receptor to mediate insulin action. Previously, in investigations of a patient with a genetic form of insulin resistance, we have identified a mutant allele encoding an insulin receptor in which lysine is substituted for asparagine at position 15 of the alpha-subunit. In the present study, we have characterized the Lys15-mutant receptor expressed by transfection of mutant cDNA into NIH-3T3 cells. The Lys15-mutation causes at least two defects in insulin receptor function. First, the mutation retards the post-translational processing of the receptor and impairs transport of the receptor to the plasma membrane, thereby reducing the number of receptors on the cell surface. Second, the mutation causes a 5-fold reduction in the affinity of the receptor to bind insulin. These two defects combine to render the target cell resistant to normal physiological concentrations of insulin. It seems likely that both functional defects associated with the Lys15-mutation can be explained by assuming that the mutation distorts the three-dimensional structure of the receptor. Presumably, the abnormal conformation interferes with the transport of the receptor through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, and also inhibits the binding of insulin to its binding site on the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2127451188,"The proteolytic activation of highly purified, heterodimeric porcine factor VIII and factor VIII-von Willebrand factor complex by thrombin was compared at I 0.17, pH 7.0, 22 degrees C. During the activation of factor VIII, heavy-chain cleavage is necessary to activate the procoagulant function, whereas light-chain cleavage is required to dissociate factor VIII from von Willebrand factor. The kinetics of activation of free factor VIII and factor VIII-von Willebrand factor complex were identical. The steady-state kinetics of thrombin-catalyzed heavy-chain cleavages and light-chain cleavage of factor VIII either free or in complex with von Willebrand factor were studied using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel radioelectrophoresis and scanning densitometry of fragments derived from 125I-labeled factor VIII. Association of factor VIII with von Willebrand factor resulted in an 8-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of light-chain cleavage (from 7 x 10(6) to 54 x 10(6) M-1 s-1). The catalytic efficiencies of heavy-chain cleavage at position 372 (approximately 6 x 10(6) M-1 s-1) and position 740 (approximately 100 x 10(6) M-1 s-1) were not affected by von Willebrand factor. We conclude that von Willebrand factor promotes cleavage of the factor VIII light chain by thrombin which is followed by rapid dissociation of the complex, so that the rate-limiting step becomes heavy-chain cleavage at position 372. This accounts for the observation that von Willebrand factor has no effect on the kinetics of activation of factor VIII by thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1569381450,"The effect of human activated protein C (APC) on fibrinolysis was studied in a cell-free system by continuously monitoring the thrombin-induced formation and subsequent tissue-type plasminogen activator-induced degradation of fibrin. In systems comprising dialyzed human plasma, APC shortens the time for lysis to occur in a concentration-dependent, saturable manner. Half-maximal activity occurs at an APC concentration of 10 nM. The effect is mediated by enhanced plasminogen activation and is dependent upon ionized calcium. The effect is lost when plasma adsorbed with barium citrate is utilized in place of unadsorbed plasma. The effect can be reconstituted, however, from components recovered from the barium citrate precipitate. Fractionation of the barium citrate adsorbable proteins with polyethylene glycol (PEG) provides two fractions, one of which is obtained by precipitation at 5% PEG, and the other of which is obtained from the 5% PEG supernatant by further precipitation at 40% PEG. The latter fraction contains Factor X and presumably the other vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Both of these fractions together, but neither of them alone, fully reconstitute barium-adsorbed plasma, such that APC-enhanced fibrinolysis occurs as in non-adsorbed plasma. These fractions also are sufficient to provide for an APC effect in a system in which purified plasminogen and fibrinogen are used in place of barium citrate-adsorbed plasma. Thus, an effect of APC on tissue-type plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis exists which is Ca2(+)-dependent and requires two or more, as yet unidentified, components that can be precipitated from human plasma by barium citrate."

https://openalex.org/W1546050838,"The control of (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4biopterin) synthesis in primed T cells was analyzed by using the human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-transformed T cell line MT-2. In contrast to the slowly progressing induction of H4biopterin synthesis during activation of resting T cells, it is completed during a 59-h period and is directed by a synergism of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). Both GTP cyclohydrolase and (6R)-(1‘,2‘-dioxopropyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin synthase activities are induced by IFN-gamma. They are further enhanced by combined treatment with IL-2, which per se is ineffective. Furthermore, the combined treatment synchronizes the time periods of both maximum activities, now extending from 33 to 44 h. This period correlates with high cellular H4biopterin levels. It is preceded by a fast and transient period of H4biopterin increase which depends on the synergistic action of both IFN-gamma and IL-2. It coincides with a transient increase in sepiapterin reductase activity. In contrast to MT-2 cells, HTLV-I-transformed HUT 102 cells constitutively secrete IFN-gamma and express IFN-gamma mRNA. The accumulation of H4biopterin is suppressed by anti-IFN-gamma polyclonal antibody and correlates with constitutive expression of all H4 biopterin-synthesizing enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1590651816,"Semi-intact cells, a cell population in which the plasma membrane is perforated to expose intact intracellular organelles (Beckers, C. J. M., Keller, D. S., and Balch, W. E. (1987) Cell 50, 523-534), efficiently reconstitute vesicular trafficking of protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cis Golgi compartment. We now extend these studies to biochemically dissect transport of protein between the ER and the Golgi into a series of sequential intermediate steps involved in the budding and fusion of carrier vesicles. At least two broad categories of transport intermediates can be detected, those that involve early steps in transport and those involved in late, fusion-related events. Early transport steps require the transport of protein through a novel intermediate compartment in which protein accumulates at reduced temperature (15 degrees C). We demonstrate that both entry and exit from this 15 degrees C compartment can be successfully reconstituted in vitro. A late step in delivery of protein to the cis Golgi compartment requires Ca2+ (pCa7) and is coincident with a step which is sensitive to a peptide analog which blocks interaction between the Rab family of small GTP-binding proteins and a downstream effector protein(s) (Plutner, H., Schwaninger, R., Pind, S., and Balch, W. E. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 2375-2384). The combined results suggest that a single round of vesicular transport between the ER and the Golgi involves a rapid transit through N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive, guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate-sensitive, ATP- and cytosol-dependent step(s) involved in vesicle formation or transport to a novel intermediate compartment, followed by a regulated fusion event triggered in the presence of Ca2+ and functional components interacting with member(s) of the Rab gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1504962298,"Abstract In contrast to phorbol esters, multiple doses of diacylgycerols are needed to differentiate U937 human monoblastic leukemic cells to a macrophage-like phenotype. Although both of these agents similarly activate protein kinase C in vitro, it is not known why these agents appear to have differing biologic effects. One possibility is that they regulate gene transcription in slightly different ways. Regulation of gene transcription by phorbol esters is complex and involves the stimulation of the transactivating proteins Jun and Fos which form dimers and bind to the AP-1 enhancer elements (5'-TGAGTCA-3'). To understand whether diacylglycerols regulate gene transcription similarly to phorbol esters and to examine whether activation of AP-1 enhancer activity is correlated with differentiation, we have treated U937 human monoblastic leukemic cells with these agents and examined activation of transcription from AP-1 enhancer elements. We find that, although a single dose of diacylglycerol, like phorbol esters, is sufficient to elevate mRNA levels of both the c-jun and c-fos protooncogenes, in contrast to phorbol esters there is no increase in either Jun protein or activation of AP-1 enhancer activity. However, multiple doses of this agent given over 24 h stimulate repeated elevations in c-jun and c-fos mRNA, increases in Jun protein, and enhancer activation. Treatment of U937 cells with ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, also stimulates an increase in c-jun mRNA, but neither activates AP-1 enhancer activity nor stimulates differentiation of these cells. However ionomycin functions to enhance the effects of diacylglycerols both on transcriptional activation and U937 differentiation. These results suggest a complex regulation of AP-1 enhancer activity in U937 cells by diacylglycerols involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Maximal activation of AP-1 enhancer elements, and not changes in jun and fos mRNA, is correlated with increases in markers of U937 differentiation. These changes may be important in the early events leading to differentiation of hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1510975240,Nickel is a component of the H2-oxidizing hydrogenase of many bacteria. We report that nickel is required not only for the activity of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum H2 uptake (hup) enzyme but also for the initiation of its transcription. A much greater level of hydrogenase-specific mRNA was detected in cells that were derepressed for hydrogenase in the presence of 5 microM nickel than in the absence of nickel. Control experiments involving probing of mRNA with a B. japonicum gene encoding a non-nickel-containing protein (delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase) demonstrated that there was no influence by nickel levels on its message. Assays utilizing a plasmid-borne gene fusion linking the 5' upstream sequence of the hup locus to a promoterless beta-Gal structural gene demonstrated that an upstream region between -239 and -168 is critical for transcriptional regulation by nickel. Hydrogenase transcription is not self-regulated by the nickel-containing hydrogenase as the hydrogenase promoter was still regulated by nickel in a mutant strain containing a Tn5 insertion in the hup structural gene. This is the first report of transcriptional regulation of a protein by nickel.
https://openalex.org/W1520176790,"Cultured murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells synthesize a number of low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins that undergo post-translational modification by isoprenoids. We used two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting to show that a 23-24-kDa protein labeled by the isoprenoid precursor [3H]mevalonate was specifically recognized by an antibody to G25K (Gp), a low molecular mass GTP-binding protein originally purified from placental, platelet, and brain membranes. Several isoelectric variants of G25K were detected in MEL cells, and all were radiolabeled with [3H]mevalonte. The G25K-immunoreactive protein did not cross-react with pan-ras antibody. Although mature p21ras is known to be localized in the cell membrane, most of the isoprenylated G25K was found in the 100,000 x g supernatant fraction when cells were lysed in buffer without detergent. Blocking isoprenoid synthesis by incubation of MEL cells with lovastatin resulted in a decrease in the concentration of G25K in the particulate fraction and a corresponding increase in immunodetectable protein in the soluble fraction. Lovastatin treatment also produced shifts in the electrophoretic mobilities of the G25K isoforms on two-dimensional gels. These observations are consistent with the idea that isoprenylation plays a permissive role in the association of G25K with the cell membrane or other organelles. However, the high proportion of soluble isoprenylated G25K in MEL cells under normal culture conditions suggests that the role of the isoprenoid modification may be more complex than simply serving as a structural anchor for stable insertion of proteins into the lipid bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1581856811,"Integral membrane-associated arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes. The ADP-ribosyltransferase was solubilized from the 100,000 x g pellet with 0.3% sodium deoxycholate and purified to greater than or equal to 95% homogeneity by successive DE52, concanavalin A-agarose, 3-aminobenzamide-agarose, and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) steps in the presence of detergents. Two molecular weight forms of the enzyme were isolated and partially characterized. The apparent Mr of the alpha-form of the enzyme purified to greater than or equal to 95% homogeneity was approximately 39,000 +/- 500 as estimated by silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Mr of the beta-form purified to greater than or equal to 80% homogeneity was 38,500 +/- 500. The rapid procedure resulted in a 200-fold purification for the alpha-form and a 645-fold purification for the beta-form, relative to the microsomal fraction. Positive identification of the enzyme was confirmed by utilizing a zymographic in situ gel assay and by HPLC assay of polyacrylamide gel slice incubations with an NAD and guanylhydrazone substrate. The specificity of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase zymographic assay was characterized by time course incubations, hydroxylamine sensitivity, 3-aminobenzamide inhibition, and histone dependence. The ADP-ribosyltransferase is inactivated by reducing agents."
https://openalex.org/W1596476387,"We have developed an oligosaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine against type III group B Streptococcus. Purified group B streptococcal type III capsular polysaccharide was depolymerized by enzymatic digestion using endo-beta-galactosidase produced by Citrobacter freundii. Following enzymatic digestion, oligosaccharides were fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-75. An oligosaccharide pool of average Mr = 14,500 (corresponding to 13.6 repeating units of the type III polysaccharide) was used for conjugation to tetanus toxoid. Tetanus toxoid was covalently coupled via a synthetic spacer molecule to the reducing end of the oligosaccharide by reductive amination. The oligosaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate elicited type III-specific anticapsular antibodies (measured in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in three out of three rabbits whereas the unconjugated native type III polysaccharide was nonimmunogenic. Antiserum from rabbits vaccinated with the oligosaccharide-protein conjugate protected mice against lethal challenge with live group B streptococci (16 out of 16 mice survived) and opsonized group B streptococci for phagocytosis in vitro. No protection was conferred by preimmune serum nor by serum from rabbits vaccinated with unconjugated native type III polysaccharide. An oligosaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine of this design may prove to be an effective immunogen for protection against group B streptococcal infection in humans. In addition, the approach to vaccine design utilized in these studies will facilitate further definition of the structural parameters that determine immune response to glycoconjugate vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1526314262,"Using a sucrose density gradient fractionation of a highly purified Golgi apparatus from rat liver, we determined the sub-Golgi distribution of CMP-NeuAc:GM3 ganglioside alpha 2----8sialyltransferase (GM3-SAT) and CMP-NeuAc:GT1b ganglioside alpha 2----8sialyltransferase (GT1b-SAT), in comparison with that of the other glycosyltransferase activities involved in ganglioside biosynthesis. While GM3-SAT was recovered in several density fractions, GT1b-SAT was mainly found on less dense sub-Golgi membranes; this indicates that these two activities are physically separate. Moreover, with regard to the monosialo pathway, CMP-NeuAc:lactosylceramide alpha 2----3sialyltransferase, UDP-GalNAc:GM3 ganglioside beta 1----4N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, UDP-Gal:GM2 ganglioside beta 1----3galactosyltransferase, and CMP-NeuAc:GM1 ganglioside alpha 2----3sialyltransferase were resolved from more dense to less dense fractions, respectively. In the disialo pathway, UDP-GalNAc:GD3 ganglioside beta 1----4N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, UDP-Gal:GD2 ganglioside beta 1----3galactosyltransferase and CMP-NeuAc:GD1b ganglioside alpha 2----3sialyltransferase co-distributed with the corresponding activities of the monosialo pathway. These last results indicate that many Golgi glycosyltransferases involved in ganglioside biosynthesis are localized in the order in which they act."
https://openalex.org/W1547662875,"A cell-free assay to monitor receptor-mediated endocytic processes has been developed that uses biotinylated transferrin and avidin-linked beta-galactosidase as receptor-associated and fluid-phase probes, respectively (Wessling-Resnick, M., and Braell, W. A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 690-699). The fusion of vesicles from heterologous sources can be detected in this assay: endocytic vesicles from K562 cells (a human cell line) will fuse with vesicles from Chinese hamster ovary cells. Fusion between endocytic vesicles is inhibited upon treatment with N-ethylmaleimide but can be restored by the addition of untreated cytosol from either cell type. The in vitro fusion reaction is also inhibited by the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogs guanosine 5'-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and adenosine 5'-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S). Other nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotides are found to inhibit the in vitro reaction in the following order of potency: GTP gamma S greater than 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GTP-PNP) greater than alpha,beta-methylene GTP (GTP-PCP). The inhibitory effects of the nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP and ATP are not additive. Moreover, excess GTP relieves the inhibition by GTP gamma S more than it relieves the inhibition by ATP gamma S, while excess ATP preferentially alleviates ATP gamma S (not GTP gamma S) inhibition. These properties suggest that the two nucleotides exert their effects at distinct points in the fusion process. Although micromolar levels of excess Ca2+ also inhibit vesicle fusion, the inhibition exerted by GTP gamma S appears to proceed via a pathway independent of the divalent cation. The GTP gamma S-sensitive step in endocytic vesicle fusion is found to occur at a mechanistic stage prior to and distinct from the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive step of the reaction. This situation permits the accumulation of a membrane vesicle intermediate in the presence of GTP gamma S; subsequent incubation of these vesicles with cytosol and GTP restores their fusion competence. Characteristics of in vitro endocytic vesicle fusion suggest that similarities exist with steps of the fusion mechanism involved with membrane traffic events of the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1567505077,"Glutaraldehyde-fixed membranes from rabbit kidney cortex were used to characterize binding of monomeric adenosine deaminase to the adenosine deaminase complexing protein. With the use of bovine adenosine deaminase it was shown that enzyme binding is a saturable, high affinity process. The K value for binding of the bovine enzyme was 11 nM. Maximum enzyme binding and rate of binding to a constant amount of membrane did not vary significantly from pH 5.0 to 9.5. Metal ions, with the exception of Hg2+, sulfhydryl reagents, and other proteins had little or a slightly stimulatory effect on maximum binding. Mercuric ion inhibited binding. Using biotinylated bovine adenosine deaminase it was shown that purified rabbit, human, and monkey enzymes compete for binding sites on fixed membranes. The K values for the rabbit and human enzymes were 9 and 6 nM, respectively. Mouse or guinea pig adenosine deaminase did not bind to the membranes or compete with the biotinylated bovine enzyme for binding sites. The retention of characteristics required for binding by enzymes from rabbit, human, monkey, and calf tissues argues for biologic significance of the adenosine deaminase-complexing protein interaction. The basis for the apparent failure of rodent adenosine deaminase to bind to complexing protein remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1695907616,"Hybridization blot (Northern) analysis of mRNA coding for alpha subunits of the Go signal-transducing protein detects three bands at 5.7, 4.2, and 3.2 kilobases (kb). We showed previously that the largest is a splice variant coding for the type 2 form of the polypeptide (alpha o2) and the two smaller RNAs react with a probe specific for the seventh of the eight exons that code for the type 1 form (alpha o1). In the present work we demonstrate that the 3.2- and 4.2-kb mRNAs also result from alternative splicing, the splice site being located 31 nucleotides downstream from the termination codon of the open reading frame, and that therefore the alpha o mRNA is made up of at least nine exons. All three alpha o mRNAs are expressed in both heart and brain, more in the latter than the former, as well as in the hamster insulin-secreting tumor (HIT) cell from which the cDNAs encoding the splice variants had been cloned. In contrast, in lung and testis we found only the 5.7-kb alpha o2 mRNA. The same analysis was unable to detect alpha o-specific sequences in either kidney, pancreas (whole), spleen, or liver, while at the same time detecting strong bands for alpha s mRNA. A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of the hamster cDNAs cloned here indicated that previously cloned alpha o cDNAs all belong to the same alpha o1A slice subclass derived from 3.2-kb mRNA. The comparison also revealed that the sequences of the untranslated regions are highly conserved among three species (rat, hamster, and brain). Their 3' tails are 99.1% (HIT versus bovine, 200 known bases) and 99.7% (HIT versus rat, 229 bases) identical, and their 5' leader sequences are 92.7% (HIT versus bovine, 165 known bases) and 90.7% (HIT versus rat, 670 bases) identical. This indicates that untranslated regions of mRNAs need not exhibit high degrees of species variation."
https://openalex.org/W1582717600,"The 20-amino acid signal peptide of human pre (delta pro)apolipoprotein A-II contains the tripartite domain structure typical of eukaryotic prepeptides, i.e. a positively charged NH2-terminal (n) region, a hydrophobic core (h) region, and a COOH-terminal polar domain (c region). This signal sequence has multiple potential sites for cotranslational processing making it an attractive model for assessing the consequences of systematic structural alterations on the site selected for signal peptidase cleavage. We previously analyzed 40 mutant derivatives of this model preprotein using an in vitro translation/canine microsome processing assay. The results showed that the position of the boundary between the h and c regions and properties of the -1 residue are critical in defining the site of cotranslational cleavage. To investigate whether structural features in the NH2-terminal region of signal peptides play a role in cleavage specificity, we have now inserted various amino acids between the positively charged n region (NH2-Met-Lys) and the h region of a parental pre(delta pro)apoA-II mutant that has roughly equal cleavage between Gly18 decreases and Gly20 decreases. Movement of the n/h boundary toward the NH2 terminus results in a dramatic shift in cleavage to Gly18 decreases. Replacement of the Lys2 residue with hydrophilic, negatively charged residues preserves the original sites of cleavage. Replacement with a hydrophobic residue causes cleavage to shift upstream. Simultaneous alteration of the position of n/h and h/c boundaries has an additive effect on the site of signal peptidase cleavage. None of these mutations produced a marked decrease in the efficiency of in vitro cotranslational translocation or cleavage. However, in sequence contexts having poor signal function, introduction of hydrophobic residues between the n and h regions markedly improved the efficiency of translocation/processing. We conclude that the position of the n/h boundary as well as positioning of the h/c boundary affects the site of cleavage chosen by signal peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1552324747,"Two new microscopic techniques make it possible to obtain images of biologically interesting molecules directly in air, vacuum, or under water. Scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy both have the capacity to visualize atoms on the surface of rigid structures and provide details of molecular structure for lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. In addition to providing visualizations of individual molecules, these scanning probe techniques allow direct imaging of complexes between molecules or between molecules and higher-order subcellular structures such as membranes and cytoskeletal components. Both microscopes can be operated under a variety of ambient conditions ranging from high vacuum to above atmospheric pressure. Specimens need not be dry; both techniques have been used to image molecules in aqueous media under nearly physiological conditions. It is proposed that as these techniques mature they will allow direct observation of many molecular interactions under physiological conditions or even in vivo while they are occurring within the cell.— Edstrom, R.

https://openalex.org/W2149481136,"To facilitate the study of the regulation of the rpsA gene, a translational fusion between the rpsA gene and the 1acZ gene was constructed. Synthesis of the fusion protein was repressed about lo-fold when rpsA was supplied in trans on a multicopy plasmid. This repression is similar to the post-transcriptional regulation previously found for the wild type rpsA gene. Addition of purified protein Sl to a coupled in vitro transcription-translation system caused a specific reduction in the synthesis of the rpsA-1acZ fusion protein. Addition of various subdomain fragments of protein Sl to the coupled in vitro system showed that the Nterminal fragment, possessing the ribosome binding domain of protein S 1, was able to repress the synthesis of the rpsA-1acZ fusion protein. In contrast, fragments from the C-terminal region, containing the nucleic acid binding domain of protein Sl, were inactive in this repression. Induction of truncated rpsA genes, coding for either the N-terminal 101 or 329 amino acids caused a reduction in the synthesis of the chromosomally encoded protein Sl, thus confirming in viva that the N-terminal part of protein Sl represses rpsA expression."
https://openalex.org/W1543974626,"Abstract The sex steroid-binding protein of human plasma SBP (or sex hormone-binding globulin, SHBG) was specifically inhibited with the alkylating affinity label, 17 beta-[[( 2-14C]bromoacetyl)oxy]-5 alpha-androstan-3-one. The natural ligand, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, was shown to protect against inactivation and labeling. The steroid-binding activity of the protein was abolished when approximately 1 mol of label was incorporated into 1 mol of dimeric SBP. In order to identify and locate the labeled amino acid in the steroid-binding site, the steroidal portion of the bound label was first removed and the protein was digested with Achromobacter protease and subdigested with trypsin. Seven radioactive peptides were isolated, sequenced, and found to contain the common sequence QVSGPLTSXR. Residue X was identified as lysine-134 from the SBP amino acid sequence (Walsh, K. A., Titani, K., Kumar, S., Hayes, R., and Petra, P. H. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 7584-7590). The results indicate that only 1 of the 2 lysine-134 residues in the homodimer was labeled. This suggests that the steroid-binding site is constructed from an association of the two subunits in an AB to BA sandwich configuration with lysine-134 residue of one subunit on one surface near the D-ring and the lysine-134 of the other subunit at the opposite end of the steroid, or well away from the steroid-binding site. Although the nature of the data does not allow description of a specific role for lysine-134, its proximity to the 17 beta-OH of the steroid nucleus suggests participation in the binding process through direct or indirect hydrogen bonding."
https://openalex.org/W1502659507,"We previously reported that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) induced sustained calcium cycling across the plasma membrane in primed competent Balb/c 3T3 cells (Kojima, I., Matsunaga, H., Kurokawa, K., Ogata, E., and Nishimoto, I. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16561-16567). The present study was conducted to examine whether IGF-I affected cellular metabolism of 1,2-diacylglycerol (1,2-DAG). In primed competent cells prelabeled with [3H]myristate, 1 nM IGF-I caused a 50% increase in [3H]DAG within 10 min. This increase in [3H]DAG was accompanied by 1) a decrease in radioactivity in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol fraction in [3H]glucosamine-labeled cells and a concomitant increase in [3H]inositol-glycan, and 2) a decrease in [3H]phosphatidylcholine and a concomitant elevation of [3H]phosphorylcholine in [3H]choline-labeled cells. When [3H]choline-labeled cells were treated with 10 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-4-acetate (TPA), [3H]phosphatidylcholine was reduced by 50%. The TPA-induced reduction of [3H]phosphatidylcholine was completely blocked by 50 microM sphingosine and 50 microM H-7, inhibitors of protein kinase C. Both sphingosine and H-7 attenuated IGF-I-mediated reduction of [3H]phosphatidylcholine. In addition, treatment with IGF-I for 3 h or more resulted in sustained increase in 1,2-DAG mass, which was attenuated by cycloheximide. The increase in DAG mass was accompanied by enhanced incorporation of [14C]glucose into 1,2-DAG. These results indicate that, in primed competent Balb/c 3T3 cells, IGF-I stimulates 1,2-DAG production via multiple pathways and that IGF-I may induce breakdown of phosphatidylcholine by a mechanism involving protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1548966756,"A microsomal preparation from chondroitin 4-sulfate-synthesizing cultured mouse mastocytoma cells was incubated with UDP-[3H]GalNAc, UDP-GlcA, and 3'-phosphoadenylylphosphosulfate (PAPS) for 30 s at 10 degrees C and with UDP-[14C]GlcA, UDP-GalNAc, and PAPS for 4 h at 37 degrees C for synthesis of 3H- and 14C-labeled chondroitin/chondroitin sulfate. The latter incubation provided more than 100 times as much product as did the short incubation at 10 degrees C. Upon chromatography of the isolated labeled glycosaminoglycans on a Sepharose CL-6B column, most of the [14C]glycosaminoglycan from the 4 h, 37 degrees C incubation was excluded from the column, indicating that this nascent glycosaminoglycan had been polymerized fully. In contrast, most of the [3H]glycosaminoglycan from the 30 s, 10 degrees C incubation was mostly retarded upon cochromatography on this same column, indicating that the nascent glycosaminoglycan was still growing in size. The labeled fractions representing chondroitin/chondroitin sulfate of varying sizes were analyzed for degree of sulfation by degradation with chondroitin ABC lyase followed by paper electrophoresis of the products. Results indicated that the [14C]chondroitin/chondroitin sulfate formed in the 4-h incubation was 60-70% sulfated. Incomplete chains of [3H]chondroitin/chondroitin sulfate formed in the 30-s incubation were also sulfated as much as 20-25%. As the size of the [3H]chondroitin/chondroitin sulfate increased, there was a concomitant increase in sulfation. These results demonstrate that in this microsomal system sulfation takes place while the nascent chondroitin glycosaminoglycan chains are still actively growing in length, although the sulfation lags somewhat behind the polymerization. This not only indicates a common membrane location for both polymerization and sulfation of chondroitin but also demonstrates that the sulfation of chondroitin by these mastocytoma cells may occur during the process of glycosaminoglycan polymerization rather than subsequent to completion of the glycosaminoglycan chains."
https://openalex.org/W1575867671,"Abstract We studied the effect of adenosine on Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in ewe heart ventricular sarcolemmal vesicles. Adenosine was found to stimulate Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in a dose-dependent manner from 0.1 nM to 10 microM, with maximal stimulation (40%) at 0.1 microM adenosine. The Vmax of Na+/Ca2+ exchange was increased, but the Km for Ca2+ was not altered. The effect of adenosine was specific since 1 microM adenine, inosine, and guanosine led to less than 15% stimulation, and adenosine diphosphate had no effect. Caffeine antagonized the activation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange by adenosine, and the order of potency of adenosine analogs was N6-(L-2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine = N6-cyclohexyladenosine = 5'-(N- ethylcarboxamido)adenosine much greater than N6-(D-2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine, indicating the involvement of A1 subclass receptors. The effect of adenosine was mimicked by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and blocked by pertussis toxin treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that A1 subclass receptors coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein mediate the activation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity by adenosine. We conclude that the negative inotropic effect of adenosine in ventricular muscle, antagonistic toward cyclic AMP, may involve activation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1507175671,"The role of GDP has heretofore been little studied in the analysis of visual receptor G-protein (G) interactions. Here we use kinetically resolved absorption and light scattering spectroscopy, centrifugation, porous membrane filtration, and enzyme assay to compare the effectiveness of GDP with that of GTP or gamma-thio-guanosine-5'-triphosphate in the modulation of G-protein binding to rod disc membranes and activated receptor (R*). We also compare effectiveness of GDP with that of GTP in the separation of G alpha and G beta gamma subunits and in activation of effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase. We find that when different nucleotide affinities are taken into account, actions such as the release of G from R* binding, earlier ascribed to GTP alone, are also typical of GDP. The principal specific actions of GTP that occur only weakly or undetectably for GDP are, respectively, the release of G-protein subunits from the membrane into solution and activation of phosphodiesterase. While GDP, like GTP, releases G-protein binding to receptor, we argue that GDP cannot mediate G-protein subunit separation, even on the membrane surface. GDP retained on G-protein after GTP hydrolysis may function to prevent tight binding to quiescent receptors in a manner analogous to its action on G-protein binding to activated receptors. Weak binding of G.GDP may function to accelerate receptor catalyzed amplification during transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1587612445,"We have undertaken a structural and functional analysis of recombinant plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) produced in Escherichia coli using site-directed mutagenesis and immunochemistry. Expression of recombinant PAI-1 yielded an inhibitor that was functionally indistinguishable from PAI-1 made in human endothelial cells. Mutations in both the reactive center P1 and P1' residues (Arg-Met) and a putative secondary binding site for plasminogen activators on PAI-1 have been engineered to assess their functional effects. The inhibition of a panel of serine proteases, including plasminogen activators, trypsin, elastase, and thrombin, has been studied. Substitution of the P1 arginine residue with lysine or the P1' residue with either valine or serine had no detectable effect on the rate of inhibition of plasminogen activators. However, replacement of both P1 and P1' by Met-Ser produced a variant with no detectable plasminogen activator inhibitor activity. Mutations introduced into either Asp102 or Lys104 in the second site did not affect the rate of inhibition of plasminogen activators. Complementary immunochemical experiments using antibodies directed against the same two regions of the PAI-1 protein confirm that the reactive center is the primary determinant of inhibitory activity and that the putative second site is not a necessary functional region."
https://openalex.org/W1528067191,"When [3H]inositol-prelabeled cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were stimulated with high K+ (56 mM) and nicotine (10 microM), a large and transient increase in [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (InsP5) accumulation was observed. The accumulation reached the maximum level at 15 s and then declined to the basal level at 2 min. The time course of accumulation of InsP5 was parallel to that of [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). Angiotensin II (Ang II) (10 microM) rapidly accumulated InsP5, but the level was sustained for 2 min. With a slower time course and a lesser amount than InsP5, high K+, nicotine, and Ang II caused an accumulation of [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and [3H]inositol hexakisphosphate. Veratridine (100 microM), maitotoxin (10 ng/ml), ATP (30 microM), platelet-derived growth factor (10 ng/ml), and endothelin (10 ng/ml) also induced the InsP5 accumulation. High K+, nicotine, veratridine, and maitotoxin induced an increase in 45Ca2+ uptake, whereas Ang II, ATP, platelet-derived growth factor, and endothelin did not cause 45Ca2+ uptake. Nifedipine, a calcium channel antagonist, inhibited the high K(+)-induced InsP5 accumulation but failed to affect the Ang II-induced InsP5 accumulation. In an EGTA-containing and Ca2(+)-depleted medium, the high K(+)-induced InsP5 accumulation was completely inhibited, whereas the InsP5 accumulation induced by Ang II was not significantly inhibited. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate inhibited partially the Ang II-induced InsP5 accumulation but failed to inhibit the high K(+)-induced accumulation. In those experiments, the changes of InsP5 accumulation were closely correlated to those of Ins(1,4,5)P3. In the chromaffin cell homogenate, [3H] Ins(1,4,5)P3 was converted eventually to [3H]InsP5 through [3H]inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate. Taken together, the above results suggest that InsP5 is rapidly formed by a variety of stimulants and that the formation of InsP5 may occur through two mechanisms, i.e. Ca2+ uptake-dependent and Ca2+ uptake-independent ones in cultured adrenal chromaffin cells."
https://openalex.org/W1543221735,"Cyclic AMP is known to enhance retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells to parietal endoderm. Recently, we showed that a parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), by activating adenylate cyclase, can substitute for exogenous cAMP in promoting retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 cells. However, the mechanisms by which endogenous cAMP levels are regulated during F9 differentiation are poorly defined. We therefore assessed whether Gs alpha, a subunit of the stimulatory coupling protein of adenylate cyclase, is induced during this process. Treatment of F9 cells with retinoic acid (1 microM) for 5 days resulted in a 20-fold increase in steady-state levels of a 2.0-kilobase Gs alpha mRNA. This was accompanied by an increase in the expression of 52- and 45-kDa Gs alpha polypeptides. Gs alpha mRNA increases within 24 h of exposure to retinoic acid, whereas the expression of alpha 1 (IV) collagen, a marker for F9 differentiation, did not increase until 48 h of treatment. In the presence of retinoic acid, exogenous human PTHrP-(1-34)-amide (20 nM) produced a further 2-fold increase in Gs alpha mRNA. These effects of retinoic acid and PTHrP were exerted largely if not entirely at the level of Gs alpha gene transcription, as assessed by nuclear run-on assay. Bt2cAMP (1 mM) did not reproduce the stimulatory effects of PTHrP on Gs alpha transcription, mRNA, or protein. These data demonstrate that a marked increase in Gs alpha expression accompanies F9 differentiation induced by retinoic acid and PTHrP, and that the regulation is predominantly transcriptional. The resulting increase in adenylate cyclase responsiveness to PTHrP and perhaps other ligands may be a critical component of the differentiation process. The effect of PTHrP on the expression of Gs alpha appears to be mediated by signals other than cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W33430780,"The solution conformation of O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1—-4)-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1—-0)-L-ser ine (GXS), a carbohydrate-protein linkage region fragment from connective tissue proteoglycans, was investigated by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling calculations. Specifically, the 1H and 13C resonances were assigned by 2D-COSY and by 1H-13C heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy methods. 2D-NOESY was used to generate distance constraints between the galactose and xylose and between the xylose and serine residues. The 1H vicinal coupling constants for the sugars and the serine were also determined. A general molecular modeling methodology suitable for complex carbohydrates was developed. This methodology employed molecular dynamics and energy minimization procedures together with the application of inter-residue spatial constraints across the linkages derived from 2D-NOESY. The first step in this methodology is the generation of a wide variety of starting conformations that span the (phi, psi) space for each linkage. In the present study, nine such conformations were constructed for each linkage using the torsion angles phi and psi corresponding to the gauche+, gauche-, and trans configurations across each of the two bonds constituting the linkage. These conformations were subjected to a combined molecular dynamics/energy minimization refinement using the NOESY derived constraints as pseudoenergy functions. Families of conformations for the whole molecule were then constructed from the structures derived for each linkage. Characterization of GXS using this methodology identified a single family of conformations that are consistent with the solution phase NMR data on this molecule."
