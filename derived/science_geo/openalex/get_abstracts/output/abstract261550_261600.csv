https://openalex.org/W2037259928,"The cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) converts naïve T cells into regulatory T (Treg) cells that prevent autoimmunity. However, in the presence of interleukin-6 (IL-6), TGF-beta has also been found to promote the differentiation of naïve T lymphocytes into proinflammatory IL-17 cytokine-producing T helper 17 (T(H)17) cells, which promote autoimmunity and inflammation. This raises the question of how TGF-beta can generate such distinct outcomes. We identified the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid as a key regulator of TGF-beta-dependent immune responses, capable of inhibiting the IL-6-driven induction of proinflammatory T(H)17 cells and promoting anti-inflammatory Treg cell differentiation. These findings indicate that a common metabolite can regulate the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immunity."

https://openalex.org/W2166102027,"Resolution of acute inflammation is an active process essential for appropriate host responses, tissue protection and the return to homeostasis. During resolution, specific omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty-acid-derived mediators are generated within resolving exudates, including resolvin E1 (RvE1) and protectin D1 (PD1). It is thus important to pinpoint specific actions of RvE1 and PD1 in regulating tissue resolution. Here we report that RvE1 and PD1 in nanogram quantities promote phagocyte removal during acute inflammation by regulating leukocyte infiltration, increasing macrophage ingestion of apoptotic polymorphonuclear neutrophils in vivo and in vitro, and enhancing the appearance of phagocytes carrying engulfed zymosan in lymph nodes and spleen. In this tissue terrain, inhibition of either cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenases--pivotal enzymes in the temporal generation of both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators--caused a 'resolution deficit' that was rescued by RvE1, PD1 or aspirin-triggered lipoxin A4 analogue. Also, new resolution routes were identified that involve phagocytes traversing perinodal adipose tissues and non-apoptotic polymorphonuclear neutrophils carrying engulfed zymosan to lymph nodes. Together, these results identify new active components for postexudate resolution traffic, and demonstrate that RvE1 and PD1 are potent agonists for resolution of inflamed tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1975617209,"A screen for small molecules that kill tumour cells with mutations in the oncogene HRAS has yielded a compound called erastin. Erastin treatment of cells expressing oncogenic RAS leads to cell death via an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. Erastin acts via mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels, a novel target that could lead to new genotype-selective anticancer drugs. The action mechanism of a RAS–RAF–MEK–pathway selective anti-tumour agent is described, this compound acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels, a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. Therapeutics that discriminate between the genetic makeup of normal cells and tumour cells are valuable for treating and understanding cancer. Small molecules with oncogene-selective lethality may reveal novel functions of oncoproteins and enable the creation of more selective drugs1. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the selective anti-tumour agent erastin, involving the RAS–RAF–MEK signalling pathway functioning in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Erastin exhibits greater lethality in human tumour cells harbouring mutations in the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS or BRAF. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we discovered that erastin acts through mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs)—a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. We show that erastin treatment of cells harbouring oncogenic RAS causes the appearance of oxidative species and subsequent death through an oxidative, non-apoptotic mechanism. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of VDAC2 or VDAC3 caused resistance to erastin, implicating these two VDAC isoforms in the mechanism of action of erastin. Moreover, using purified mitochondria expressing a single VDAC isoform, we found that erastin alters the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, using a radiolabelled analogue and a filter-binding assay, we show that erastin binds directly to VDAC2. These results demonstrate that ligands to VDAC proteins can induce non-apoptotic cell death selectively in some tumour cells harbouring activating mutations in the RAS–RAF–MEK pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2027097496,"MicroRNAs are short regulatory RNAs that negatively modulate protein expression at a post-transcriptional level and are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of several types of cancers. Here we show that miR-221 and miR-222, encoded in tandem on chromosome X, are overexpressed in the PC3 cellular model of aggressive prostate carcinoma, as compared with LNCaP and 22Rv1 cell line models of slowly growing carcinomas. In all cell lines tested, we show an inverse relationship between the expression of miR-221 and miR-222 and the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1. We recognize two target sites for the microRNAs in the 3′ untranslated region of p27 mRNA, and we show that miR-221/222 ectopic overexpression directly results in p27 down-regulation in LNCaP cells. In those cells, we demonstrate that the ectopic overexpression of miR-221/222 strongly affects their growth potential by inducing a G1 to S shift in the cell cycle and is sufficient to induce a powerful enhancement of their colony-forming potential in soft agar. Consistently, miR-221 and miR-222 knock-down through antisense LNA oligonucleotides increases p27Kip1 in PC3 cells and strongly reduces their clonogenicity in vitro. Our results suggest that miR-221/222 can be regarded as a new family of oncogenes, directly targeting the tumor suppressor p27Kip1, and that their overexpression might be one of the factors contributing to the oncogenesis and progression of prostate carcinoma through p27Kip1 down-regulation.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 5The abbreviations used are: miRNA, microRNA; UTR, untranslated region; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PCa, prostate cancer; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium, inner salt. are a wide class of small, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate protein expression at the post-transcriptional level. Through the specific targeting of the 3′ UTRs of multicellular eukaryotic mRNAs, miRNAs down-regulate gene expression by either inducing degradation of target mRNAs or impairing their translation (1Kim V.N.

The expression of many microRNAs was shown to be temporally and spatially regulated, whereas the disruption of their physiological expression patterns was associated with several examples of human tumorigenesis, suggesting that they may play a role as a novel class of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (3Gregory R.I.

In fact, single or small sets of microRNAs were demonstrated to be dysregulated in diverse cancer subtypes including Burkitt lymphoma (4Metzler M. Wilda M. Busch K. Viehmann S. Borkhardt A.

The general rule stemming from these studies is that the non-physiological modulation of micro-RNA expression frequently characterizes cancer, thus making the comprehension of microRNA expression an important goal for diagnostic and prognostic applications, especially when this knowledge is further strengthened by the discovery of the molecular targets specifically modulated by microRNAs. Prostate cancer, the most common malignant disease in the Western world, causes about 80,000 deaths a year in Europe (12Bracarda S. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2005; 56: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Despite considerable efforts made in recent years to understand prostate tumorigenesis, the molecular mechanisms involved in its initiation and progression remain largely unknown. Among factors whose misregulation was tightly linked to prostate cancer (PCa) progression, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 is a well established marker of poor prognosis as it was shown that absent or decreased p27Kip1 expression is associated with high tumor grade and poor prognosis of PCa and of several other human cancers (13Tsihlias J.

Urol. 1998; 159: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It is also well known that p27Kip1 regulation, both in physiological and pathological conditions, is exerted mostly at a post-transcriptional level (19Belletti B. Nicoloso M.S. Schiappacassi M. Chimienti E. Berton S. Lovat F. Colombatti A. Baldassarre G. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 1589-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this work we describe the differential expression of two microRNAs, miR-221 and miR-222, encoded in tandem from a gene cluster located on chromosome X, in three human prostate carcinoma cell lines, the androgen-independent, strongly aggressive PC3 cell line, the androgen-responsive 22Rv1, and the androgen dependent, slowly growing LNCaP, which represent models of distinct stages of prostate carcinoma progression. Consistently with the proposed role of microRNAs as regulators of key components of cell cycle progression, here we identify p27Kip1 as a target for miR-221/miR-222. We show that p27Kip1 expression in the three PCa cell lines inversely correlates with that of miR-221/miR-222, and that the ectopic overexpression of miR-221 or both microRNAs in LNCaP, where they are normally almost undetectable, has deep consequences on the proliferation rate and the cell cycle phase distribution. We propose that p27Kip1 is an important functional target for miR-221/222 in prostate carcinoma, and that the modulation of these microRNAs might be used as a molecular marker to characterize the progression of this tumor. Cell Lines and Transfections—All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 20 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfections were performed by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) using 8 μg of plasmid DNA in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen), as recommended by the manufacturer. For transient transfections, 7 μg of pCDNA(+)3.1-based plasmids were co-transfected with a 1:7 relative amount of a reporter plasmid, pEGFP-C3 (Clontech), to monitor transfection efficiency. Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy 48 h after transfection to calculate the transfection efficiency. For each well, the cell number in four random microscopic fields was counted and transfection efficiency for each sample was estimated as the mean value of green fluorescent protein expressing cells over 100 cells per field. When establishing stable transfectants, the transfected cells were selected by adding 0.4 mg/ml G418 to the culture medium. Assay of Luciferase Activity—The 3′ UTR of the human p27kip1 gene was PCR amplified using primers 5′-cagctcgaattaagaatatg-3′ and 5′-gtgtaacaataattggcatc-3′, and cloned downstream of the Renilla luciferase stop codon in pRLTK vector (Rl-luc, Promega), giving rise to the p3′UTR-p27 plasmid. This construct was used to generate, by inverse PCR, the p3′UTRmut-p27 plasmid (primers: reverse mut1269, 5′-aaccacccaacgcttttagaggcagatc-3′, forward 1270, 5′-cattatgcaattaggttttcc-3′, reverse 1331, 5′-ggtaaaactatatacacagg-3′, forward mut1336, 5′-ggaggttcacataaactttggggaagg-3′). LNCaP cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with p3′UTR-p27 or p3′UTRmut-p27 plasmid plus pGL3 control vector (Pp-luc, Promega). Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and assayed with Dual Luciferase Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate. Plasmid Constructs—The miR-221, miR-222, and miR-222/221 cluster sequences were amplified by PCR from genomic human DNA using the following primers: miR-221 sense, 5′-cgagatctgtgagaattacttgcaagctg-3′; miR-221 antisense, 5′-ccgctcgagcattggtgagacagccaatg-3′; miR-222 sense, 5′-cgcagatcttttcttccacagagcccctcc-3′; miR-222 antisense, 5′-ggggatcctctcaggacactgaagcaga-3′; miR-222/221 sense, 5′-cgcagatcttttcttccacagagcccctcc-3′; miR-222/221 antisense, 5′-gctcgaggcggtcctttctctgcactct-3′. The correct sequences of amplified products were verified by sequencing and cloned into the BamHI site of pCDNA(+)3.1 vector (Invitrogen) for miR-222, and BamHI-XhoI sites for miR-221 and miR-222/221. Their expression was detected by Northern blot analysis after 48 h from transfection in LNCaP and 22Rv-1 cells lines. miRNA and p27 Knockdown—Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled LNA oligonucleotides against miR-221 and miR-222 were obtained from Exiqon. Knockdown oligos were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) into PC3 cells at a final concentration of 40 nm. After 24 h, the cells were collected and miRNAs and p27 protein levels analyzed. Before loading onto 7 m urea polyacrylamide gels, RNA samples were denatured for 5 min at 65 °C in 3.5 m urea. SMARTpool siRNA against p27 were obtained from Dharmacon and transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 into LNCaP cells at a final concentration of 100 nm. Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was measured by using Promega’s Cell Titer Aqueous assay with MTS tetrazolium, in which viable cells convert MTS tetrazolium into a formazan-colored product (OD490 nm). 2,500 cells/well were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h before treatment to let them attach to the bottom of the well. The cell growth was then measured at 48 and 96 h after the cellular adhesion. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, 20 μl of MTS solution were added to 100 μl of culture media and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and the optical density was measured at 490 nm. Five independent experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Transfection of miR-222 into Anti-p27 siRNA-treated LNCaP Cells and Cell Viability Assay—1 × 104 cells/well were seeded in a 96-well plate, incubated for 24 h to let them attach to the bottom of the well, and then transfected with 80 nm anti-p27 SMARTpool siRNAs or control siRNAs (Dharmacon) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). 24 h after this first transfection, cells were transfected again with the appropriate combination of anti-p27 siRNA or control siRNA, mixed with 100 nm synthetic miR-222 (Exiqon) or a control microRNA. Thus, in this experimental setting, reported in Fig. 4C, time 0 corresponds to the second transfection with siRNA + miRNA, and cell growth was measured by MTS from that time on, at 24, 48, and 72 h. Soft Agar Colony Assay—Anchorage-independent growth was determined by soft agar analysis as follows: 2.5 × 103 LNCaP or PC3 cells per 35-mm dish were seeded in 0.35% agar on top of a base layer containing 0.5% agar. In the assays involving anti-p27 siRNAs or anti-miR-221 or anti-miR-222 LNA oligos, cells were plated 24 h after transfection. Plates were incubated at 37 °C at 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for 2 weeks and stained with 0.005% crystal violet for 1 h. Colonies >0.1 mm (for LNCaP cells) or >0.15 mm (for PC3 cells) in diameter were counted under a microscopic field at ×10 magnifications. Each assay was performed in triplicate on two independent occasions. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from PC-3, LNCaP, and 22Rv-1 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For Northern blot analysis of miRNAs, 15 μg of total RNA were separated on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and electro-transferred to Immobilon Nylon+ membrane (Millipore Corporation). The specific probes, end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, were: miR-221, 5′-gaaacccagcagacaatgtagc-3′; miR-222, 5′-gagacccagtagccagat-3′; and U6, 5′-cacgaatttgcgtgtcatccttgcgcaggggcc-3′. Bands were quantified with ImageJ 1.34s or OptiQuant 3.1 Packard Instrument software. Bromodeoxyuridine Incorporation/FACS Analysis—5 × 105 transfected cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Cells were then pulsed with 10 μm 5-bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma) for 30 min, harvested with trypsin, washed, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 2 m HCl to denature DNA into single-stranded molecules. After washing in borax buffer (0.1 m sodium tetraborate, pH 8.5), cells were incubated with 0.65 μg/ml anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody (BD Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Then cells were resuspended in 200 μl of washing buffer and labeled with 5 μl of anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Calbiochem) for 30 min in the dark. Labeled cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μg/ml propidium iodide for 25 min before flow cytometric analysis on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using “Cell Quest” software. For anti-p27 assay, 5 × 105 cells were transfected and incubated at 37 °C. After 72 h, cells were harvested and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and then treated with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide and 50 μg/ml RNase A for 25 min at 37 °C. All assays were performed 3 times. Immunoblot Analysis—For each of three independent experiments, 20-40 μg of total protein extract was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The levels of p27 expression were evaluated by using the rabbit polyclonal anti-p27 antibody (AB3003; Chemicon) or the monoclonal anti-p27 antibody (610241; BD Biosciences). As a loading control, β-actin expression levels were measured by rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibody (A2066 Sigma). The secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (AP132P or AP160P; Chemicon) was detected using ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were quantified with ImageJ 1.34 or OptiQuant 3.1 Packard Instrument software. MicroRNAs miR-221 and miR-222 Are Expressed in PC3 Cells but Are Absent in LNCaP and 22Rv1 and Their Expression Is Inversely Linked to That of p27Kip—Our experimental goal was to search for microRNAs differentially expressed in prostate carcinoma. To this aim, we studied three human PCa cell lines, PC3, LNCaP, and 22Rv1, virtually representing three stages of prostate carcinoma progression. This study, performed by Northern blot analysis, revealed that the microRNAs miR-221 and miR-222 show a differential expression: they are easily detectable in PC3 cells, deriving from a distal metastasis of an androgen-independent, highly aggressive tumor, whereas they are almost absent in LNCaP, derived from a local lymph node metastasis of an androgen-dependent, slowly growing carcinoma (Fig. 1A). The expression in the 22Rv1 cell line, an androgen-responsive primary cell line, was nearly undetectable, like in LNCaP (Fig. 1A). We performed a bioinformatic search (20Hsu P.W. Huang H.D. Hsu S.D. Lin L.Z. Tsou A.P. Tseng C.P. Stadler P.F. Washietl S. Hofacker I.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 (-D139): D135Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) for putative target mRNAs of both miRNAs, and we found that the 3′ UTR of human p27kip1 harbors two sites likely recognized by the miR-221 and miR-222 (Fig. 1B). In fact, the 5′ “seed” regions of these two miRNAs are identical, and theoretically target the same sites, located at nucleotides 1262-1269 and 1336-1342 of the p27kip1 mRNA (NM_004064.0). Moreover, another putative site matching miR-222 and miR-221 is recognizable at nucleotides 1660-1667 in the 3′ UTR of p27 mRNA, where it is also associated with additional flanking matches (Fig. 1B). To experimentally validate the possible relationship inversely linking p27Kip1 and miR-221 and miR-222, we started by studying p27 expression levels in the same three prostate carcinoma cell lines: Western blot analysis showed that p27 is clearly detectable in LNCaP and 22Rv1, whereas it is strongly reduced in PC3 cells (Fig. 1C). The whole of these results gave us a first hint that the expression of miR-221 and miR-222 might be one of the mechanisms acting to negatively regulate p27Kip1 in prostate carcinoma cells. The Overexpression of miR-221, miR-222, or miR-221/miR-222 Reduces p27Kip1 Expression in LNCaP and 22Rv1 Cells and the Knock-down of the Same MicroRNAs Increases p27Kip1 in PC3 Cells—To check if these microRNAs actually affect p27Kip1 expression in LNCaP cellular environment, we analyzed the consequences of the ectopic expression of miR-221 and miR-222. We made three constructs, p-221, p-222, and p-T, containing, respectively, miR-221, miR-222, or the whole genomic region with miR-221 and miR-222 encoded in tandem, under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter. Fig. 2A shows that LNCaP cells transduced with p-221, p-222, or p-T clearly expressed high levels of the expected mature microRNAs, whereas very little expression was detected in control-transduced cells. Similar results were obtained with the 22Rv1 cell line (data not shown). Notably, no pre-miRNA accumulation was detected in all cases, indicating efficient processing of the ectopically expressed miRNAs in the cells. A Western blot performed on the same cells (Fig. 2B) shows that the p27Kip1 protein was clearly reduced (50%) in both LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells expressing the single miRNAs or a combination of both, as compared with cells transfected with the empty vector. These data strongly support the hypothesis that miR-221 and miR-222 post-transcriptionally regulate p27Kip1 expression in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. To study the biological significance of these miRNAs in PC3 cells, where they are normally expressed, we knocked down miR-221 or miR-222 expression. To do this, we transfected PC3 cells with LNA antisense oligonucleotides targeting either miR-221 or miR-222, and we analyzed the effects on p27 production. PC3 cells transfected with anti-221 and anti-222 LNA showed a 2-fold decrease in miR-221 and miR-222 levels when compared with control cells transfected with LNA against a microRNA not expressed in these cells (Fig. 2C). As expected, the reduction of miR-221 or miR-222 was accompanied by an increase of p27 protein of about 2-fold (Fig. 2D). The results that we collected by both the overexpression and the knock down of miR-221 and/or miR-222 converge toward the identification of p27 as an actual target of miR-221/miR-222 in LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC3 PCa cell lines. The Insertion of the 3′ UTR of p27 mRNA Downstream of a Luciferase Reporter Gene Confers Responsiveness to miR-221 and miR-222—To show that the 3′ UTR of p27 mRNA actually contains matching sites for the interaction with miR-221 and miR-222 and is likely responsible for the effect of these miRNAs on p27 expression, we cloned the whole 3′ UTR region downstream of the luciferase open reading frame, and we used this reporter construct to transfect LNCaP cells. The same luciferase-3′UTR reporter construct was transfected into LNCaP cells stably transfected with plasmids p-221, p-222, or p-T. Fig. 3 shows that the presence of miR-221, miR-222, or miR-221 and miR-222 in tandem strongly affected luciferase expression (>50%), measured as relative luciferase activity. The reduction of luciferase activity was totally comparable in all transfected cell lines, either expressing miR-221 or miR-222, or a combination of miR-221 and miR-222. On the contrary, when we used, as a reporter construct, a plasmid harboring the 3′ UTR of p27 mRNA where two core binding sites for miR-221 and miR-222 were inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis, we observed only a very slight effect on luciferase activity, compared with LNCaP cells that did not express any microRNA. These results support the bioinformatic prediction indicating the 3′ UTR of p27 mRNA as a target for miR-221 and miR-222, and denote that the two matching sites thus identified strongly contribute to the miRNA-mRNA interaction mediating the post-transcriptional inhibition of the expression. The Ectopic Expression of miR-221/222 Enhances Growth of LNCaP Cells and Induces a Progression to the S Phase of Cell Cycle—p27Kip1 is known to play a key role as a regulator of cell cycle progression, strongly inhibiting G1/S transition. We tested if the cell growth potential of stably transfected LNCaP cells expressing miR-221, miR-222, or both miR-221 and miR-222 was modified, as a consequence of the demonstrated p27 reduction. Fig. 4A shows the results of an MTS assay where cell viability of empty vector-transfected LNCaP cells is compared with that of the microRNA-expressing cells: the expression of the microRNAs induced a marked increase in growth rate (more than 2-fold at 96 h after the start of the experiment), both in the presence of miR-221 or miR-222 alone, or the two microRNAs in tandem. These results found a parallel confirmation in a similar experiment we performed to show that a reduction of p27 dosage by means different from microRNA expression leads to analogous outcomes: when we transfected LNCaP cells with anti-p27 siRNAs that were able to reduce p27 of about 60% (Fig. 4B, inset), we observed a sharp increase in cell growth, as compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, reducing p27 levels in LNCaP cells, either by miR-221/222 expression or by anti-p27 siRNA transduction, is sufficient to induce a comparable cell growth increase. To strongly prove the p27 dependence of these effects of miR-221/222, we set up a different experiment, where we measured the proliferation variations induced by microRNAs in LNCaP cells previously transfected with anti-p27 siRNAs. The aim of this experiment was to study if and how the p27-depleted cellular environment responds to miR-221 or miR-222 addition. When one of the microRNAs, miR-222, was transfected into LNCaP cells previously treated with anti-p27 siRNAs, we observed that, after 48 h from miR-222 transfection, anti-p27 siRNA and miR-222 seemed to co-operate to the reduction of p27 protein (Fig. 4C, right panel), and consistently to additively enhance the growth rate. This latter effect is clearly observed at 72 h, when the functional consequences of p27 depletion are expected (Fig. 4C, left panel). We then investigated LNCaP cell cycle phase distribution through flow cytometric analysis. This analysis revealed that LNCaP cells expressing miR-221, miR-222, or the miR-221/222 cluster had a significant increase in S phase population, as compared with empty vector-transfected cells, with a concomitant decrease of the G1 portion (Fig. 5A). As for cell growth assays, cell cycle phase distribution was also consistently affected by anti-p27 siRNAs, clearly driving cells out from G1 toward S phase (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrate the ability of miR-221 and miR-222 to overcome a p27-mediated cell cycle arrest, and support the role of these two miRNAs as negative regulators of p27Kip1. The Ectopic Expression of miR-221 or miR-222 Increases the Clonogenic Potential of LNCaP Cell, and miR-221/222 Knock-down Strongly Reduces It in PC3 Cells—A hallmark of cellular transformation is the ability of tumor cells to grow in an anchorage-independent way in a semisolid medium. To analyze the possible effects of miR-221/miR-222 expression on this cell property, we tested the ability of transfected LNCaP cells to grow and to form colonies when seeded at low density in soft agar. As shown in Fig. 6, A and C, LNCaP cells stably expressing miR-221 or miR-222 formed many more colonies than the empty vector-transfected cells (118 ± 9.5 versus 37.5 ± 6.9 for miR-221, and 146 ± 15.6 for miR-222). These results highlight that miR-221 and miR-222 expression affects another typical feature of tumor cell growth. In addition, we compared the effect of miR-221 and miR-222 expression with that of anti-p27 siRNAs on the clonogenic potential of LNCaP cells. The colonies formed by LNCaP cells transduced with anti-p27 siRNAs were far more abundant than those formed by LNCaP cells transduced with a control siRNA (Fig. 6, B and D). Thus, as for proliferation studies, we obtained the same kind of results in both cases, independently of which sort of small RNA molecule was used to target p27. Conversely, we also showed that the inhibition of miR-221 and miR-222 through LNA antisense oligonucleotides in PC3 cells was able to strongly reduce (4.5-fold) the number of the colonies growing in soft agar (Fig. 6, E and F), in accordance with our observation about the increase of p27 levels after transfection with anti-miR-221/222 LNA oligonucleotides. This strengthens our hypothesis that directly connects miR-221 and miR-222 action to p27 modulation, and to the consequent changes in cell properties under the control of p27. In the last few years, an ever growing number of articles have been published describing a link between several forms of human cancer and the expression of microRNAs (for a review, see Ref. 21Esquela-Kerscher A. Slack F.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (6240) Google Scholar). Despite the great deal of work that has been done to date, however, only in a minority of the cases were the targets of the microRNAs that were shown to be specifically modulated in tumors successfully identified. As it is evident that full comprehension of the functional role of microRNAs in oncogenesis will be achieved only by elucidating their mechanism of action in each type of tumor, in this work we focused on a pair of microRNAs, miR-221 and miR-222, overexpressed in the specific context of prostate carcinoma. The data we present here are based on our observation that this couple of miRNAs are differentially expressed in a PCa cell line derived from a strongly aggressive tumor (PC3) versus other cell lines derived from slowly growing neoplasms (LNCaP and 22Rv1). As these PCa cell lines are commonly recognized as models of different stages of PCa progression (22Webber M.M. Bello D. Quader S. Prostate. 1997; 30: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the expression of miR-221/222 in PC3 aggressive cells might be considered a marker of their increased tumorigenic potential. This hypothesis is strengthened by our finding that one target, recognized and modulated by miR-221/222 in PCa cell lines, is the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1, properly placed in the family of tumor suppressors. Through the luciferase assay, we demonstrated that at least two effective binding sites are present in the p27kip1 3′ UTR; consistently, we observed that miR-221 and miR-222 levels are inversely linked to those of p27 expression in PC3, 22Rv1, and in LNCaP cell lines. Moreover, the ectopic expression of these miRNAs or their knock-down are able to induce the predictable opposite effects on p27 expression in LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC3 cells. We provided functional evidence about the possible role of miR-221 and miR-222 in PCa, by showing that the forced expression of these microRNAs is able, per se, to induce an enhancement of LNCaP cell growth potential, which is comparable and additive to that induced by a specific pool of anti-p27 siRNAs. In turn, this increase in cell growth is tightly linked to the G1 to S shift we observed in the same cells, which is in agreement with modulation of p27, a known regulator of the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. This property is accompanied by their increased ability to grow in an anchorage-independent way, a feature clearly connected to the tumorigenic nature of PCa cells. The clonogenic potential was strongly enhanced when miR-221 or miR-222 were overexpressed in LNCaP cells, and was consistently reduced in PC3 cells where miR-221 and miR-222 were knocked down through LNA oligos, thus providing us with a further indication about the involvement of this microRNA in PCa development. The inverse correlation between the cdk inhibitor p27 and prognosis in several human cancers, including prostate carcinoma, is well known (14Macri E. Loda M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Of note, p27 decrease is an early event in prostate carcinoma oncogenesis, as it is frequently observed in proliferative inflammatory atrophy, which is considered as a precursor lesion preceding carcinoma onset (24De Marzo A.M. Marchi V.L. Epstein J.I. Nelson W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1985-1992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The observation that p27 is a dose-dependent tumor suppressor is of great importance for the interpretation of our present data, as it would be in agreement with the typical regulatory mode of microRNAs acting by modulating the amount of their targets, rather than knocking them out. We believe that this fine-tuning regulatory action exerted by miR-221/222 on the levels of p27 protein present in the cell might be considered as another piece of the sophisticated puzzle made up of several post-transcriptional mechanisms ensuring a fast response of p27 amount to environmental and intracellular variations. Actually, at least in theory, one could draw tantalizing conclusions by reviewing numerous papers that describe an upward modulation of miR-221 and/or miR-222 in a variety of cancers, the majority of which is also known to be characterized by p27 loss or mutations. miR-221 and miR-222 are overexpressed in solid tumors of the colon, pancreas, and stomach (25Volinia S.

Liyanarachchi S. Nagy R. Volinia S. Calin G.A. Liu C.G. Franssila K. Suster S. Kloos R.T. Croce C.M. de la Chappelle A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 19075-19080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Furthermore, miR-222 is a marker of poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma versus well differentiated cases of the same tumor, being overexpressed about 10-fold in the former tumors (9Murakami Y. Yasuda T. Saigo K. Urashima T. Toyoda H. Okanoue T. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2537-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). miR-221 and miR-222 up-regulation was described also in a non-solid tumor, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as associated with some important markers of poor prognosis (27Calin G.A. Ferracin M. Cimmino A. Di Leva G. Shimizu M. Wojcik S.E. Iorio M.V. Visone R. Sever N.I. Fabbri M. Iuliano R. Palumbo T. Pichiorri F. Roldo C. Garzon R. Sevignani C. Rassenti L. Alder H. Volinia S.

We previously demonstrated that miR-221 and miR-222 are the most significantly up-regulated microRNAs in glioblastoma multiforme (11Ciafre S.A. Galardi S. Mangiola A. Ferracin M. Liu C-G. Sabatino G. Negrini M. Maira G. Croce C.M. Farace M.G Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), and we have also collected preliminary experimental evidence that suggest the existence of a link between miR-221/222 overexpression and p27 down-regulation in this totally different model of human tumor. 6S. Galardi, S. A. Ciafre, and M. Giulia Farace, unpublished results. In only three cases was the modulation of miR-221 and miR-222 described in conjunction with the elucidation of their target, which was the tyrosine kinase receptor KIT. However, in one case, miR-221 and miR-222 appeared to be down-regulated in an erythroleukemic cell line with a consequent overexpression of KIT (28Felli N. Fontana L. Pelosi E. Botta R. Bonci D. Facchiano F. Liuzzi F. Lulli V. Morsilli O. Santoro S. Valtieri M. Calin G.A. Liu C.G. Sorrentino A. Croce C.M. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18081-18086Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), whereas in the other the two miRNAs in tandem were overexpressed in papillary thyroid carcinoma, causing a down-regulation of KIT (8He H. Jazdzewski K. Li W. Liyanarachchi S. Nagy R. Volinia S. Calin G.A. Liu C.G. Franssila K. Suster S. Kloos R.T. Croce C.M. de la Chappelle A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 19075-19080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). In a third report, the overexpression of miR-221 and miR-222 in HUVEC reduced their response to the angiogenic activity of stem cell factor by targeting its receptor c-Kit (29Poliseno L. Tuccoli A. Mariani L. Evangelista M. Citti L. Woods K. Mercatanti A. Hammond S. Rainaldi G. Blood. 2006; 108: 3068-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for miR-221 and miR-222 as modulators of the formation of new vessels in physiological and pathological conditions. We think that our results, which identify p27Kip1 as a target for miR-221 and miR-222 in the context of prostate carcinoma cell lines, perfectly fit within a dynamic view of the microRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression: it is well known and widely predicted that the relationship between microRNAs and target mRNAs is not a “one to one” connection, as the same mRNA can be regulated by more than one miRNA, and that the choice of how many and which miRNAs target one 3′ UTR is strongly determined by the specific cellular environment (30Meltzer P.S. Nature. 2005; 435: 745-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). An miRNA that regulates targets playing opposite roles in the control of cell proliferation may act as a tumor suppressor in some cancers and as an oncogene in others, depending on which targets are driving tumorigenesis in that specific cellular milieu. In conclusion, our results suggest that overexpression of miR-221 and miR-222 may contribute to the growth and progression of prostate carcinoma, at least in part by blocking p27 mRNA translation. Additional functional studies are now needed for the comprehension of the molecular basis of the formation of this carcinoma, and give new clues to develop innovative therapies targeting specific tumor markers, such as the overexpressed microRNAs. We are thankful to Daniela Caporossi and Giulia Guarguaglini for helpful advice and comments. We are indebted to Silvia Soddu for kindly providing the anti-p27 monoclonal antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1978329448,"Random cell-to-cell variations in gene expression within an isogenic population can lead to transitions between alternative states of gene expression. Little is known about how these variations (noise) in natural systems affect such transitions. In Bacillus subtilis , noise in ComK, the protein that regulates competence for DNA uptake, is thought to cause cells to transition to the competent state in which genes encoding DNA uptake proteins are expressed. We demonstrate that noise in comK expression selects cells for competence and that experimental reduction of this noise decreases the number of competent cells. We also show that transitions are limited temporally by a reduction in comK transcription. These results illustrate how such stochastic transitions are regulated in a natural system and suggest that noise characteristics are subject to evolutionary forces."
https://openalex.org/W2083033504,"MEG3 is a maternally expressed imprinted gene suggested to function as a non-coding RNA. Our previous studies suggest that MEG3 has a function of tumor suppression. The tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in tumor suppression and mediates the functions of many other tumor suppressors. Therefore, we hypothesized that MEG3 functions through activation of p53. We found that transfection of expression constructs for MEG3 and its isoforms results in a significant increase in p53 protein levels and dramatically stimulates p53-dependent transcription from a p53-responsive promoter. Using this as the functional assay, we demonstrated that the open reading frames encoded by MEG3 transcripts are not required for MEG3 function, and the folding of MEG3 RNA is critical to its function, supporting the concept that MEG3 functions as a non-coding RNA. We further found that MEG3 stimulates expression of the growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) by enhancing p53 binding to the GDF15 gene promoter. Interestingly, MEG3 does not stimulate p21CIP1 expression, suggesting that MEG3 can regulate the specificity of p53 transcriptional activation. p53 degradation is mainly mediated by the mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2). We found that MDM2 levels were down-regulated in cells transfected with MEG3, suggesting that MDM2 suppression contributes at least in part to p53 accumulation induced by MEG3. Finally, we found that MEG3 is able to inhibit cell proliferation in the absence of p53.

Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Besides the well known transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs, ncRNAs can be categorized into small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs, micro-RNAs, small interfering RNAs, and medium/large ncRNAs that do not belong to the aforementioned RNAs (1Mattick J.S.

Small nuclear RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs are usually 60–300 nucleotides long and are mainly involved in ribosome biogenesis and RNA splicing (4Matera A.G. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). MicroRNAs and small interfering RNAs are mostly 22 nucleotides long and function to negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level (3Mattick J.S. Makunin I.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R121-R132Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The medium/large ncRNAs are usually 1–2 kb in length and may carry polyadenylyl tails, which are mRNA-like except that they do not encode any proteins. ncRNAs in this class are particularly interesting because they appear to have distinctive functions based on published reports (2Pang K.C. Frith M.C. Mattick J.S. Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and participate in a variety of cellular functions. For example, H19 was reported to suppress growth of embryonal tumors and is believed to be an ncRNA tumor suppressor (5Hao Y. Crenshaw T. Moulton T. Newcomb E. Tycko B.

Carbonnelle D. Tomasoni C. Papaconstadinou A. Roussis V. Roussakis C. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 25: 519-527PubMed Google Scholar). The steroid receptor RNA activator functions as a co-activator in regulating transcription by nuclear receptors (7Lanz R.B. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Albrecht U. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J.

In addition, there is no evidence suggesting that MEG3/Gtl2 is antisense to any gene transcripts. MEG3/Gtl2 with the paternally imprinted gene Dlk1 defines the Dlk1-Gtl2 imprinted locus, which lies on human chromosome 14q and mouse chromosome 12q (9Wylie A.A. Murphy S.K. Orton T.C. Jirtle R.L.

The imprinting of this gene is controlled by an intergenic germ line-derived differentially methylated region (11Lin S.P. Youngson N. Takada S. Seitz H. Reik W. Paulsen M. Cavaille J. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Genomic structure analysis reveals that the MEG3/Gtl2 gene consists of 10 exons (8Miyoshi N. Wagatsuma H.

MEG3 gene transcripts consist of several small open reading frames (ORFs). No consensus Kozak sequences are found in their initial ATG region. In addition, the putative proteins encoded by those ORFs do not resemble any known functional proteins or peptide. Therefore, it has been suggested that MEG3/Gtl2 is an ncRNA (8Miyoshi N.

However, because the function of MEG3 has remained largely unknown, a functional assay did not exist to confirm its ncRNA identity. MEG3 is expressed in many normal human tissues, with the highest expression found in the brain and pituitary gland (14Zhang X. Zhou Y. Mehta K.R. Danila D.C. Scolavino S. Johnson S.R. Klibanski A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 5119-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In the normal pituitary, it is co-localized to gonadotroph-producing cells (14Zhang X. Zhou Y. Mehta K.R.

However, we found that human pituitary tumors of a gonadotroph cell linage do not express MEG3 (14Zhang X. Zhou Y. Mehta K.R. Danila D.C. Scolavino S. Johnson S.R. Klibanski A. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

The loss of MEG3 expression in tumors has been found to be, at least in part, the result of hypermethylation in the MEG3 gene promoter region as well as the intergenic germ line-derived differentially methylated region (15Astuti D.

Furthermore, we found that ectopic expression of one MEG3 isoform, MEG3a, suppresses growth of several human cancer cell lines in culture (14Zhang X. Zhou Y. Mehta K.R. Danila D.C. Scolavino S. Johnson S.R. Klibanski A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 5119-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the MEG3 gene may play a role in tumor suppression. Tumor suppression is a cellular defense mechanism preventing the neoplastic transformation of normal cells, and the tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in tumor suppression (17Vogelstein B.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). p53 is activated by many stress signals, such as sustained mitogenic stimulation and DNA damage (19Harris S.L. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Its activation leads to cell cycle arrest, replicative senescence, or apoptosis depending on the strength of the signal and the cellular context (20Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). p53 also suppresses tumor development through activities unrelated to cell cycle regulation, such as inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (21Teodoro J.G. Parker A.E. Zhu X. Green M.R. Science. 2006; 313: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, functional inactivation of p53 has been found in most human cancers (17Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). The most common cause of p53 inactivation is a mutation in the p53 gene. Other causes that functionally inactivate p53 include interaction with viral oncoproteins and genetic alterations in genes whose products affect the function of p53, such as those that interact with, or transmit information, to and from p53 (17Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). p53 also plays a critical role in mediating tumor suppression functions of other tumor suppressors, such as ARF (22Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), BRCA1 (23Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N. August A. Aaronson S.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2006; 22: 395-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that p53 may also mediate MEG3 function. We found that ectopic expression of MEG3 activates p53 and stimulates its transcription activation activity. Using this as the functional assay, we demonstrate that MEG3 functions as a non-coding RNA. In addition, we show that MEG3 stimulates expression of GDF15 through activation of p53. Finally, we demonstrate that MEG3 is able to inhibit cell proliferation in the absence of p53. Our data suggest that MEG3 ncRNA has a tumor suppression function, which is mediated by both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways. Plasmid Constructs—MEG3 cDNA and its isoforms, MEG3a, MEG3b, MEG3c, and MEG3d were subcloned into the expression vector pCI under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The resultant constructs were designated as pCI-MEG3, pCI-MEG3a, pCI-MEG3b, pCI-MEG3c, and pCI-MEG3d, respectively. A fragment of approximate 400 bp was deleted from the 5′-end of MEG3 cDNA in pCI-MEG3 to generate pCI-MEG3-del5. pCI-MEG3b-del5 was similarly constructed. DNA fragments of MEG3 containing ORF1, ORF2, ORF3, ORF1 + 2, ORF1 + 3, or ORF2 + 3 were obtained from MEG3 cDNA and inserted into pCI to generate pCI-MEG3-ORF1, pCI-MEG3-ORF2, pCI-MEG3-ORF3, pCI-MEG3-ORF12, pCI-MEG3-ORF13, and pCI-MEG3-ORF23, respectively. MEG3 expression constructs carrying point mutations that cause a frameshift as well as create a premature in-frame stop codon in each ORF were generated using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method with pCI-MEG3 as the template as described previously (27Zhou Y. Mehta K.R. Choi A.P. Scolavino S. Zhang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 462-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 were destroyed in pCI-MEG3–1T23, pCI-MEG3–12A3, and pCI-MEG3–123C, respectively. Both ORF1 and −3 were destroyed in pCI-MEG3–1T23C, whereas all three ORFs were destroyed in pCI-MEG3–1T2A3C. A fragment between SalI and TfiI in MEG3 cDNA was deleted to generate pCI-MEG3-dST. A fragment between SphI and HindIII was deleted to generate pCI-MEG3-dSH. The CMV promoter was removed from pCI-MEG3b by restrictive enzyme digestion to generate pCI-MEG3b-P. The p53-responsive reporter construct p53-Luc was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The control plasmid pCMVβ expressing β-galactosidase was obtained from BD Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). pCMS-d2EGFP is an expression vector containing an expression cassette of destabilized green fluorescent protein (d2EGFP) under the control of an SV40 early gene promoter. MEG3 cDNA was cloned into this vector under the control of a CMV promoter to generate pCMS-d2EGFP-MEG3. Expression vectors for p14ARF, and MEG3-del5 were similarly constructed. A DNA fragment containing sequences of the GDF15 gene promoter from nucleotide position −920 to +85 was amplified by PCR using a human genomic clone as template (clone CTC-251H24, from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and subsequently cloned into pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison WI) to generate pGDF15–920-Luc. A fragment of 220 bp between −920 and −701 containing the distal p53 binding site was removed from pGDF15–920-Luc to generate pGDF15–700-Luc. To generate pGDF15–920mt-Luc, the proximal p53 binding site in the GDF15 promoter (between nucleotides +19 and +39) was deleted in pGDF15–920-Luc by the PCR based site-directed mutagenesis method as describe previously (27Zhou Y. Mehta K.R. Choi A.P. Scolavino S. Zhang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 462-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The pGDF15–700mt-Luc was similarly generated. All GDF15 promoter constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—HCT116 and U2OS cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained according to the vendor's instructions. HCT116p53+/+ and HCT116p53–/– cells were kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein and maintained in McCoy 5A medium conditioned with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with Mirus TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) overnight as previously described (27Zhou Y. Mehta K.R. Choi A.P. Scolavino S. Zhang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 462-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For p53 reporter assays, cells in 12-well plates were transfected with plasmid DNAs containing 50 ng of p53-Luc, 0.2 μg of pCMVβ, and others as indicated. For GDF15 promoter assays, cells were transfected with 50 ng of reporter constructs and 0.1 μg of pCMVβ, plus 0.2 μg of pCI, pCI-p14ARF, pCI-p53, pCI-MEG3, or pCI-MEG3-del5 as indicated. Twenty-four hours after incubated with fresh culture medium, cells were lysed and luciferase activities were measured as previously described (27Zhou Y. Mehta K.R. Choi A.P. Scolavino S. Zhang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 462-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was finally normalized against the β-galactosidase activity from the same well. Northern and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) to isolate total RNA according to the manufacturer's instruction, or lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer to obtain total protein as previously described (27Zhou Y. Mehta K.R. Choi A.P. Scolavino S. Zhang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 462-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed to detect MEG3 transcripts using the NorthernMax kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). cDNA probes specific to MEG3 were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Ready-To-Go DNA Labeling Beads from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). After electrophoresis, the ethidium bromide-stained gel was photographed, and the 28 S rRNA band was used as equal loading control. Western blotting was performed as described previously (27Zhou Y. Mehta K.R. Choi A.P. Scolavino S. Zhang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 462-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The blot was probed with antibody DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to detect p53 protein. GDF15 was probed with anti-NAG-1 antibody from Millipore Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). p21CIP1 and MDM2 were probed with antibody F-5 and SMP14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. β-Actin was detected by probing the membrane with an anti-β-actin antibody from Sigma-Aldrich. MEG3 Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from normal colon mucosa and HCT116 cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. MEG3 transcripts were detected using OneStep reverse transcription-PCR kit from Qiagen. The primers used for reverse transcription-PCR were 5′-CCACTCCCAGTTCAATTACAGCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAGTGCCCTCGTGAGGTGTAG-3′ (reverse). As a control, the transcript of β-actin was also detected. The primers were 5′-CATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGAT-3′ (reverse). The PCR products were resolved by 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—Cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates. After transfection, cells were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 20 min and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. The fixed cells were treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min followed by treatment with 2 n hydrochloric acid for 30 min. Cells were incubated with anti-BrdUrd antibody in incubation buffer from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG-TRITC antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline at least three times between each treatment. The coverslips were mounted with Vectashield Mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The number of BrdUrd labeled cells per 100 GFP-expressing cells was counted under a fluorescence microscope and designated as the BrdUrd-labeling index (BrdUrd-LI). BrdUrd-LI in cells transfected with pCMS-d2-MEG3 was designated as (BrdUrd-LI)MEG3, and BrdUrd-LI in cells transfected with pCMS-d2EGFP only was (BrdUrd-LI)GFP. The relative BrdUrd-LI for MEG3-transfected cells was calculated as follows: [(BrdUrd-LI)MEG3/(BrdUrd-LI)GFP] × 100. The relative BrdUrd-LI for cells transfected with blank vector pCMS-d2EGFP was 100. The relative BrdUrd-LI for cells transfected with other constructs was similarly calculated. ChIP Assay—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed with ChIP-IT kit from Active Motif following the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). HCT116p53+/+ cells in P100 culture dishes were transfected overnight with pCI, pCI-p14ARF, and pCI-MEG3, respectively. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde. Cells were lysed and subsequently sonicated with a Branson 250 sonifier. Nine 15-s bursts of sonication (output was set at 3 and duty cycle at 30) were applied with 30-s pauses to avoid overheating. A portion of the sonicated lysates was used to purify chromatin DNA and used as input DNA. Lysates equal to 45 μg of chromatin DNA from each sample were used in immunoprecipitation with 3 μg of either normal rabbit IgG or an anti-p53 antibody (FL-393, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The precipitated chromatin DNA was purified and subject to PCR analysis. Primers used to detect GDF15 promoter and p21CIP1 promoter are as follows. For GDF15 promoter DNA containing the distal p53 binding site, 5′-AGGTATTGCCATCTTGCCCAGACTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTCACCTTGAAGCCATCCTCACAG-3′ (reverse); for GDF15 promoter containing the proximal p53 binding site, 5′-CATCTGGTCAGTCCCAGCTCAGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAACTCTCGGAATCTGGAGTCTTCG-3′ (reverse); for p21CIP1 promoter containing distal p53 binding site, 5′-GCAACTCTCGGAATCTGGAGTCTTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAGCCACCAGCCTCTTCTATGCCAG-3′ (reverse); for p21CIP1 promoter containing proximal p53 binding site, 5′-CCGAGGTCAGCTGCGTTAGAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCAGAGGATGGATTGTTCATCTGAACAG-3′ (reverse). MEG3 Activates p53 in Human Cancer Cells—The MEG3 gene contains 10 exons and is known to express multiple alternatively spliced transcripts (8Miyoshi N. Wagatsuma H. Wakana S. Shiroishi T. Nomura M.

Genome. 2003; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We isolated five of them from a human fetal liver cDNA library as described previously (14Zhang X. Zhou Y. Mehta K.R. Danila D.C. Scolavino S. Johnson S.R. Klibanski A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 5119-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that one of the cDNAs was reported previously as the human MEG3 transcript by Miyoshi et al. (GenBank™ NR_002766) (8Miyoshi N. Wagatsuma H. Wakana S. Shiroishi T. Nomura M. Aisaka K. Kohda T. Surani M.A. Kaneko-Ishino T. Ishino F. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). It contains sequences from all exons but 5, 6, and 7 (Fig. 1A). MEG3a, which we have previously reported (14Zhang X. Zhou Y. Mehta K.R. Danila D.C. Scolavino S. Johnson S.R. Klibanski A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 5119-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), contains an additional exon 6 compared with MEG3. The rest of the isolated cDNAs are new MEG3 isoforms, designated as MEG3b, MEG3c, and MEG3d, respectively (Fig. 1A). p53 has been shown to mediate functions of many tumor suppressors, such as ARF (22Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), BRCA1 (23Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N. August A. Aaronson S.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), PTEN (25Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 462-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and VLH (26Roe J.S. Kim H. Lee S.M. Kim S.T. Cho E.J. Youn H.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 395-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that p53 may also play a role in the anti-proliferative function of MEG3. To investigate this possibility, we transfected expression constructs for MEG3 and its isoforms into, HCT116, a human colon cancer cell line which contains wild-type (wt) p53 and does not express MEG3 (Fig. 1B). We found that cells transfected with MEG3 or any of its isoforms had significant increases in p53 protein levels (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether the accumulated p53 in MEG3-transfected cells is functional, we used a p53-responsive reporter construct (p53-Luc) to measure p53 activity after co-transfection with expression constructs of MEG3 and its isoforms into HCT116p53+/+ cells. p53-Luc contains multiple p53 binding sites at its promoter region controlling the luciferase cDNA and has been widely used in quantifying p53 activity. As shown in Fig. 1D, luciferase activities were significantly higher in HCT116p53+/+ cells transfected with any of the MEG3 expression constructs than in cells transfected with blank vectors (Fig. 1D). To exclude the possibility that transcription stimulation from p53-Luc by MEG3 and its isoforms is cell line-specific, we did similar p53 reporter assays in the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS, which expresses functional p53 (Fig. 1E). As shown in Fig. 1E, transfection of MEG3 and its isoforms significantly stimulates luciferase expression from p53-Luc (Fig. 1E). These data indicate that the p53 protein accumulated by transfection of MEG3 and its isoforms is functionally active. To ensure that the activation of luciferase expression from p53-Luc by MEG3 and its isoforms is p53-dependent, we did similar experiments in HCT116p53–/– cells, which are isogenic to HCT116p53+/+ cells and do not express functional p53. As a positive control, we co-transfected 50 ng of p53-Luc with 50 pg of a wt p53 expression construct and found that the induction of luciferase expression was ∼40-fold compared with that in cells transfected with vector only (Fig. 1F). In contrast, MEG3 and its isoforms failed to stimulate any luciferase expression even at 400 ng per transfection in these cells (Fig. 1F), indicating that stimulation of expression from p53-Luc by MEG3 and its isoforms is p53-dependent. p53 Activation Requires MEG3 Transcription—To investigate whether MEG3 and its isoforms activate p53, we introduced their expression into MEG3-deficient cells by transfection. One possibility was that p53 activation might be the result of a cellular stress response to the introduction of certain foreign DNAs, such as MEG3 and its isoforms. To exclude this possibility, we transfected HCT116p53+/+ cells with pCI-MEG3b-P, which was created by deletion of the CMV promoter from pCI-MEG3b. As expected, no MEG3b transcript was detected in cells transfected with pCI-MEG3b-P by northern blotting (Fig. 2A). Importantly, transfection of this plasmid also f"

High-resolution analyses of marine sediment cores from the Iberian margin trace a number of associated changes simultaneously. Proxies of sea surface temperature and water mass distribution, as well as relative biomarker content, demonstrate that this typical north-south coupling was pervasive for the cold phases of climate during the past 420,000 years. Cold episodes after relatively warm and largely ice-free periods occurred when the predominance of deep water formation changed from northern to southern sources. These results reinforce the connection between rapid climate changes at Mediterranean latitudes and century-to-millennial variability in northern and southern polar regions."

https://openalex.org/W2027737150,"The death of massive stars produces a variety of supernovae, which are linked to the structure of the exploding stars. The detection of several precursor stars of type II supernovae has been reported (see, for example, ref. 3), but we do not yet have direct information on the progenitors of the hydrogen-deficient type Ib and Ic supernovae. Here we report that the peculiar type Ib supernova SN 2006jc is spatially coincident with a bright optical transient that occurred in 2004. Spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the supernova leads us to suggest that the progenitor was a carbon-oxygen Wolf-Rayet star embedded within a helium-rich circumstellar medium. There are different possible explanations for this pre-explosion transient. It appears similar to the giant outbursts of luminous blue variable stars (LBVs) of 60-100 solar masses, but the progenitor of SN 2006jc was helium- and hydrogen-deficient (unlike LBVs). An LBV-like outburst of a Wolf-Rayet star could be invoked, but this would be the first observational evidence of such a phenomenon. Alternatively, a massive binary system composed of an LBV that erupted in 2004, and a Wolf-Rayet star exploding as SN 2006jc, could explain the observations."

https://openalex.org/W2027533821,The human brain is found to produce a magnetic field near the scalp which varies in synchrony with periodic electrical stimulation applied to a finger. Use of a highly sensitive superconducting quantum interference device as a magnetic field detector reveals that the brain's field is sharply localized over the primary projection area of the sensory cortex contralateral to the digit being stimulated. The phase of the response at the stimulus frequency varies monotonically with the repetition rate and at intermediate frequencies yields a latency of approximately 70 milliseconds for cortical response.
https://openalex.org/W1985403743,"Semaphorin-3A (sema3A) is a neuropilin-1 (np1) agonist. It inhibits the binding of the 165-amino acid form of VEGF (VEGF165) to np1 and was reported to inhibit angiogenesis as a result. However, we find that sema3A concentrations that inhibit the mitogenic effects of VEGF165 do not inhibit VEGF165-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). Furthermore, sema3A inhibits the biological effects of VEGF121, a VEGF form that does not bind to neuropilins and basic fibroblast growth factor, a growth factor whose activity, unlike that of VEGF, is not inhibited by small interfering RNA directed against np1. Therefore, the mechanism by which sema3A inhibits VEGF165 activity does not depend on competition with VEGF165 for binding to np1. Sema3A induced rapid disappearance of focal contacts followed by collapse of the actin cytoskeleton in human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells. HEK293 cells expressing sema3A repel human endothelial cells and at high concentrations induce their death by apoptosis. Furthermore, sema3A inhibited the formation of tubes from endothelial cells in an in vitro angiogenesis assay. Similar effects are induced by the neuropilin-2 (np2) agonist sema3F. These inhibitory effects are abrogated by small interfering RNAs directed against np1 or np2, respectively. The anti-proliferative effects of sema3A and sema3F are additive when the semaphorins are added as pure proteins. However, when sema3A and sema3F were co-expressed in HEK293 cells their pro-apoptotic and cell repellant activities appeared to be synergistic. These observations suggest that combinations of sema3A and sema3F may be able to inhibit tumor angiogenesis more effectively than single semaphorins.

Semaphorins are axon guidance factors that induce localized collapse of neuronal growth cones (1Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A.

In addition to their indispensable role in the shaping of the nervous system the neuropilins were also found to play important roles in developmental angiogenesis as revealed by gene targeting experiments that revealed major vascular defects in mice that lack either np1 or both np1 and np2 (8Kawasaki T.

It was found that the neuropilins also function as receptors for heparin binding forms of the angiogenic factor VEGF and are expressed in endothelial cells (10Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S.

Experiments in which the native np1 receptor of mice was replaced by a np1 variant that binds VEGF but not sema3A indicate that the cardiovascular abnormalities observed in mice lacking functional np1 receptors are probably caused by impaired VEGF signal transduction rather than impaired sema3A signaling (13Gu C. Limberg B.J. Whitaker G.B. Perman B. Leahy D.J. Rosenbaum J.S. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. J. Biol.

Sema3A inhibits VEGF165-induced endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Sema3A inhibits the binding of VEGF165 to np1 and it is assumed that this is the cause of the inhibitory effects. Furthermore, sema3A inhibited sprouting in the rat aortic ring in vitro angiogenesis assay (15Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that VEGF165 can in turn inhibit sema3A-induced cell contraction (16Narazaki M. Tosato G. Blood. 2006; 107: 3892-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), that implantation of sema3A releasing beads can inhibit developmental angiogenesis in developing limbs of chick embryos (17Bates D.

Biol. 2003; 255: 77-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and that sema3A release from endothelial cells regulates branching of blood vessels in the developing chick embryo brain (18Serini G.

Nature. 2003; 424: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet known whether sema3A can affect tumor development and tumor angiogenesis. In contrast, the gene encoding the np2 agonist sema3F was initially characterized as a tumor suppressor that is lost in small cells lung carcinoma (19Xiang R.H. Hensel C.H. Garcia D.K. Carlson H.C.

Tse C. Naylor S.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2637-2643PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence indicating that sema3F is an inhibitor of angiogenesis (22Kessler O. Shraga-Heled N. Lange T. Gutmann-Raviv N. Sabo E. Baruch L. Machluf M. Neufeld G. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1008-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 23Bielenberg D.R. Hida Y. Shimizu A. Kaipainen A. Kreuter M. Kim C.C. Klagsbrun M. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1260-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The anti-angiogenic effects of sema3F do not seem to depend upon competition with VEGF165 for binding to np2 because sema3F seems to initiate np2-dependent signaling that results in inhibition of VEGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell proliferation (22Kessler O. Shraga-Heled N. Lange T. Gutmann-Raviv N. Sabo E. Baruch L. Machluf M. Neufeld G. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1008-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Additional evidence indicates that sema3F also affects the behavior of some tumor cells directly, by inhibiting their migration and attachment (23Bielenberg D.R. Hida Y. Shimizu A. Kaipainen A.

It does that using a mechanism that does not require competition with VEGF165 for a shared receptor because it is also able to inhibit the survival promoting effects of VEGF121, a VEGF form that does not bind to neuropilins. We show that the effects of sema3A and sema3F are synergistic at low concentrations. We also show that sema3A inhibits the spontaneous organization of endothelial cells into tube-like structures in an in vitro angiogenesis assay.

Shraga-Heled N. Lange T. Gutmann-Raviv N. Sabo E. Baruch L. Machluf M. Neufeld G. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1008-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Radial artery and saphenous vein-derived endothelial cells were a kind gift from Dr. Flugelman (Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center, Haifa). Human radial artery and sapheneous vein-derived endothelial cells were cultured as previously described for HUVEC cells (10Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P.

HEK293, which express sema3A, were generated by transfecting cells with the sema3A-FLAG/pcDNA3.1/Hygro plasmid. To simultaneously express sema3A and sema3F, sema3A expressing HEK293 cells were transfected with the sema3F-myc/pcDNA3.1/neo plasmid (22Kessler O. Shraga-Heled N. Lange T. Gutmann-Raviv N. Sabo E. Baruch L. Machluf M. Neufeld G. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1008-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Clones expressing sema3F at similar levels to those found in the parental sema3F expressing HEK293 cells were selected using G418 (0.5 mg/ml), followed by isolation of clones and Western blot screens for characterization of sema3A and sema3F expression levels. Production and Purification of Sema3A—The sema3A cDNA was ligated in-frame to a FLAG epitope tag inserted in-frame before the stop codon. The cDNA was ligated into the pcDNA3.1/hygro plasmid to generate the sema3A-FLAG/pcDNA3.1/hygro expression plasmid. HEK293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine and stable sema3A-FLAG expressing clones were isolated using hygromycin (0.3 mg/ml). HEK293 cells transfected with the sema3A expression vector or with empty expression vector were cultured to 90% confluence. The medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Sodium butyrate (5 mm) was added after 24 h to the control and to the sema3A expressing cells, and the medium was collected after an additional 24 h. HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.3) and protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg/ml; leupeptin, 5 μg/ml; aprotinin, 2 μg/ml, and 1 mm EDTA) were added. The medium was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (0.5 ml beads/0.5 liter of medium). The column was washed thoroughly with TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20) and bound sema3A eluted using 0.1 m glycine (pH 3.0) into a neutralizing volume of 1 m Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) to obtain a final concentration of 150 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.3). Sema3A containing fractions and the corresponding fractions from the control were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Endothelial Proliferation and Repulsion Assays—HUVEC (passages 4–8) were seeded in gelatin-coated 48- or 24-well dishes at a concentration of 104 or 2 × 104 cells/well, respectively, in M199 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Angiogenic growth factors and either sema3A (0.3 μg/ml) or a corresponding volume from a control fraction were added after the cells adhered. On day 2, the factors were re-added. Adherent cells were counted on day 4 using a Coulter counter. In proliferation or repulsion experiments using semaphorin-secreting HEK293 cells, endothelial cells were seeded in gelatinized 48-(2 × 104 cells/well) or 24-(5 × 104 cells/well) well dishes in M199 containing 20% FCS and 5 ng/ml bFGF. The following day up to 5% HEK293 cells expressing various semaphorins were seeded on top of the endothelial cells in M199 containing 10% FCS with or without 0.5 ng/ml bFGF. In some of the experiments the cells were incubated prior to seeding with 5 μg/ml of the fluorescent vital dye DiI for 30 min to enable easy detection of the cells in mixed cell cultures. Cells were photographed using an inverted phase-contrast/fluorescence microscope after 24–48 h and counted in a Coulter counter. ERK1/2 and VEGFR-2 Phosphorylation—HUVEC cells were seeded in 6-well gelatinized dishes at a concentration of 4 × 105 cells/well in growth medium containing 10% FCS. Cells were allowed to attach and were incubated 16 h at 37 °C. The cells were transferred to room temperature and incubated 15 min with sema3A (0.5 μg/ml) or a corresponding volume of a control fraction purified similarly from cells transfected with empty expression vector. Subsequently, VEGF121 (10 ng/ml) or VEGF165 (3 ng/ml) were added or not and the cells were incubated for 10 more minutes. The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 0.03 ml of lysis buffer containing HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.4), 4 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml Na3VO4, 4.5 mg/ml Na4P2O7, and fresh protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg/ml; leupeptin, 5 μg/ml; and aprotinin, 2 μg/ml). The cells were scraped off, nonsoluble debris was removed by low speed centrifugation at 4 °C, and aliquots of cell lysate containing 20–60 μg of protein separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter and probed with an antibody directed against phosphorylated ERK1/2 or phosphorylated Y-951 of VEGFR-2. The blot was then stripped and re-probed with an antibody directed against ERK2 (total ERK) or VEGFR-2 (Total VEGFR-2). Quantification of band intensity was performed using a Fuji Film image reader LAS-3000 machine and the ratio between phosphorylated protein and the total amount of a target protein determined using the Multi-Gauge program. Down-regulation of Neuropilin Expression in HUVEC Using siRNA—The np1-specific siRNA r(AAGGAAACCUUGGUGGGAU)d(TT) and the np2-specific siRNA r(CCAGAAGAUUGUCCUC AAC)d(TT) or a control siRNA r(UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU)dTdT were transfected into HUVEC using Oligofectamine at a final concentration of 120 nm. The cells were trypsinized 1 day following transfection, and seeded at desired concentrations. To verify down-regulation of neuropilins, cells were lysed 72 h following transfection, 40 μg of protein from the cell lysates were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies directed against np1 or np2. To verify that the amount of protein in each lane is similar the membrane was stripped and re-probed with antibodies directed against β-actin. Silver Staining—Silver staining was performed according to the instructions of the vendor. Apoptosis Assays—For fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, HUVEC cells were seeded in gelatinized 6-cm dishes (6 × 105 cells/dish). The following day HEK293 cells (2.5 × 104 cells/dish) co-expressing sema3A and sema3F or HEK293 cells expressing sema3A, sema3F, or empty vector-transfected cells (5 × 104 cells/dish) were seeded on top of HUVEC cells in M199 medium containing 10% FCS. After 28 h the supernatant and the trypsinized cells from each plate were centrifuged, washed once in cold PBS, and cells fixed in ice-cold 70% EtOH overnight. The next day the cells were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml RNase A and 20 μg/ml propidium iodide for 30 min at 37 °C. FACS analysis was performed using a Callibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The proportion of cells with hypodiploid DNA content was quantified using the CellQuest program. To quantify apoptosis by active caspase-3 content HUVEC cells were seeded in gelatinized 6-well dishes (4 × 105 cells/well) in medium containing 20% FCS and 5 ng/ml bFGF. The following day, the medium was aspirated, replaced with fresh medium lacking bFGF, and 1 μg/ml of sema3A or sema3F or corresponding volumes of control fractions were added. Serum-starved cells were used as a positive control and cells treated with 5 ng/ml bFGF were used as a negative control. The supernatant and the trypsinized cells from each well were lysed 24 h later and 100 μg of protein were loaded on a 14% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with an antibody directed against active caspase-3. Blots were then stripped and the total amount of protein assessed using antibodies directed against β-actin. Microscopic determination of DNA fragmentation by the TUNEL method was performed using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (DeadEnd™ Colorimetric TUNEL System, Promega). Briefly, HUVEC were seeded in gelatinized 24-well dishes (5 × 104/well) in M199 medium containing 20% FCS and various factors were added. After 36 h the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and permeabilized by incubation with 0.2% Triton® X-100 in PBS. DNA strand breaks were labeled with biotinylated nucleotide mixture using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was bound to the biotinylated nucleotides incorporated into the 3′-OH end of damaged DNA and detected by diaminobenzidine staining. Positive cells were counted blindly and the results expressed as the percentage of TUNEL positive cells. The total number of cells counted in each group was at least 100. Tube Formation Assay—Fibrin gels were prepared by dissolving bovine fibrinogen immediately before use in M199 medium to a final protein concentration of 2.5 mg/ml and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. Fibrinogen was added to 24-well dishes (0.3 ml/well). Bovine thrombin was added to a final concentration of 0.2 units/ml and the dishes were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. HUVEC cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were then seeded on top of the fibrin gel. After spreading, the cells were covered with a similar coat of fibrin gel. M199 medium supplemented with 20% FCS and 1 μg/ml sema3A or a corresponding control fraction was added after polymerization of the covering gel. Developing capillaries were photographed using a phase-contrast microscope. HEK293 Proliferation Experiments—HEK293 cells transfected with empty expression vector or HEK293 cells expressing recombinant sema3A or sema3F were seeded in 48-well gelatin-coated dishes (5 × 103 cells/well). Cells were trypsinized and counted in a Coulter counter every day. Immunofluoresence Experiments—HUVEC were seeded in 8-well gelatin-coated chamber slides (4 × 104 cells/chamber). Following a 7-min incubation with sema3A at 37 °C, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized using 0.5% Triton for 1 min. Following 3 more washes in PBS and blocking with 10% goat serum in PBS (1 h at room temperature), the cells were then incubated with anti-vinculin antibody followed by washes with PBS. Bound antibody was visualized using a Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and photographed using a fluorescent microscope. A similar procedure was used to stain actin fibers with Alexa-conjugated phalloidin except that the cells were stimulated with sema3A for 30 min prior to fixation. Sema3A Inhibits VEGF121 as Well as VEGF165 and bFGF-induced Proliferation of Endothelial Cells—Sema3A was previously found to inhibit VEGF165-induced proliferation, to compete with VEGF165 for binding to np1, and to inhibit VEGF-induced angiogenesis in in vitro angiogenesis assays (15Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that sema3F inhibits proliferation of endothelial cells and angiogenesis by a mechanism that does not require competition with VEGF for binding to shared receptors (22Kessler O. Shraga-Heled N. Lange T. Gutmann-Raviv N. Sabo E. Baruch L. Machluf M. Neufeld G. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1008-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Here we have used sema3A tagged at the C-terminal with a FLAG epitope tag, which we have purified on an anti-FLAG affinity resin (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 4). A fraction purified similarly from the conditioned medium of cells transfected with empty expression vector was used as a control in all the experiments in which purified sema3A was used (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 5, and 6). VEGF165 promotes the proliferation and survival of endothelial cells. These activities were inhibited by Sema3A (Fig. 1B). It was reported previously that sema3A and VEGF165 compete for a common binding site on np1 (15Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, we observed that sema3A was also able to inhibit the activity of VEGF121, a VEGF form that does not bind to neuropilins (Fig. 1C) (12Gluzman-Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Herzog Y. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18040-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Sema3A was also able to inhibit bFGF-induced proliferation of HUVEC (Fig. 3F) even though the mitogenic response of HUVEC to bFGF is not affected when the expression of np1 is inhibited (data not shown). Furthermore, sema3A compromised the survival of endothelial cells even in the absence of VEGF, indicating that sema3A transduces signals that compromise endothelial cell survival regardless of the presence or absence of VEGF (Fig. 1D). To make sure that the inhibition was due to sema3A and not due to nonspecific factors such as endotoxin we have heated the sema3A. Endotoxin is heat resistant (27Sharma S.K. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1986; 8: 5-22PubMed Google Scholar) but the inhibitory activity was completely abolished by heating (data not shown). We have also tested the concentration of endotoxin in our assays and it was less than 10 pg/ml, which is a non-toxic concentration (28Ferro D. Quintarelli C. Lattuada A. Leo R. Alessandroni M. Mannucci P.M. Violi F. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1377-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Sema3A inhibits the activity of bFGF even though neuropilin-1 is not required for bFGF-induced signaling.A, HUVEC cells were seeded in gelatinized 6-well dishes (4.5 × 105 cells/well) in growth medium containing 10% FCS. After 16 h the medium was aspirated and replaced with conditioned medium of empty vector-transfected HEK293 cells (pcDNA)(lanes 1, 3, and 5) or HEK293 cells expressing sema3A (s3a)(lanes 2, 4, and 6). For conditioning, HEK293 cells expressing or not expressing sema3A (80% confluent) were incubated 24 h in M199 containing 10% FCS. Following a 15-min preincubation at room temperature, 0.5 ng/ml bFGF (lanes 3 and 4) or 1 ng/ml (lanes 5 and 6) were added or not added (lanes 1 and 2) to the cells. The experiment was terminated after 10 more minutes. Phospho-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 were visualized as described. B, the ratio between phosphorylated ERK1/2 and the total amount of ERK1/2 shown in A was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, HUVEC were transfected with nonspecific siRNA (SiC) or with siRNA directed against np1 (Sinp1). ERK1/2 activation in response to the indicated bFGF concentrations was then assayed as described under A. D, the ratio between phosphorylated ERK1/2 and the total amount of ERK1/2 shown in C was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” E, HUVEC were transfected with nonspecific siRNA or siRNA directed against np1 and the expression of the neuropilins determined by Western blot analysis as described. F, HUVEC were seeded in gelatinized 24-well dished (2 × 104 cells/well) in conditioned medium from HEK293 cells expressing Sema3A (s3a) or in conditioned medium from empty vector-transfected HEK293 cells (C) in the presence or absence of bFGF (0.5 ng/ml) (bF).

https://openalex.org/W2079272422,"The repetitive DNA that constitutes most of the heterochromatic regions of metazoan genomes has hindered the comprehensive analysis of gene content and other functions. We have generated a detailed computational and manual annotation of 24 megabases of heterochromatic sequence in the Release 5 Drosophila melanogaster genome sequence. The heterochromatin contains a minimum of 230 to 254 protein-coding genes, which are conserved in other Drosophilids and more diverged species, as well as 32 pseudogenes and 13 noncoding RNAs. Improved methods revealed that more than 77% of this heterochromatin sequence, including introns and intergenic regions, is composed of fragmented and nested transposable elements and other repeated DNAs. Drosophila heterochromatin contains ""islands"" of highly conserved genes embedded in these ""oceans"" of complex repeats, which may require special expression and splicing mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2066052992,"Although GSK-3 activity can be regulated by phosphorylation and through interaction with GSK-3-binding proteins, here we describe N-terminal proteolysis as a novel way to regulate GSK-3. When brain extracts were exposed to calcium, GSK-3 was truncated, generating two fragments of ∼40 and 30 kDa, a proteolytic process that was inhibited by specific calpain inhibitors. Interestingly, instead of inhibiting this enzyme, GSK-3 truncation augmented its kinase activity. When we digested recombinant GSK-3α and GSK-3β protein with calpain, each isoform was cleaved differently, yet the truncated GSK-3 isoforms were still active kinases. We also found that lithium, a GSK-3 inhibitor, inhibits full-length and cleaved GSK-3 isoforms with the same IC50 value. Calpain removed the N-terminal ends of His-tagged GSK-3 isoenzymes, and exposing cultured cortical neurons with ionomycin, glutamate, or N-methyl-d-aspartate led to the truncation of GSK-3. This truncation was blocked by the calpain inhibitor calpeptin, at the same concentration at which it inhibits calpain-mediated cleavage of NMDAR-2B and of p35 (the regulatory subunit of CDK5). Together, our data demonstrate that calpain activation produces a truncation of GSK-3 that removes an N-terminal inhibitory domain. Furthermore, we show that GSK-3α and GSK-3β isoenzymes have a different susceptibility to this cleavage, suggesting a means to specifically regulate these isoenzymes. These data provide the first direct evidence that calpain promotes GSK-3 truncation in a way that has implications in signal transduction, and probably in pathological disorders such as Alzheimer disease. Although GSK-3 activity can be regulated by phosphorylation and through interaction with GSK-3-binding proteins, here we describe N-terminal proteolysis as a novel way to regulate GSK-3. When brain extracts were exposed to calcium, GSK-3 was truncated, generating two fragments of ∼40 and 30 kDa, a proteolytic process that was inhibited by specific calpain inhibitors. Interestingly, instead of inhibiting this enzyme, GSK-3 truncation augmented its kinase activity. When we digested recombinant GSK-3α and GSK-3β protein with calpain, each isoform was cleaved differently, yet the truncated GSK-3 isoforms were still active kinases. We also found that lithium, a GSK-3 inhibitor, inhibits full-length and cleaved GSK-3 isoforms with the same IC50 value.

These data provide the first direct evidence that calpain promotes GSK-3 truncation in a way that has implications in signal transduction, and probably in pathological disorders such as Alzheimer disease. The GSK-3 protein (EC 2.7.11.26) is a proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase that was originally identified and named for its ability to phosphorylate the enzyme glycogen synthase (1Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Since its discovery, GSK-3 has been postulated to be involved in many physiological processes, and it plays important roles in embryonic development, cell differentiation, microtubule dynamics, cell cycle division, cell adhesion, glucose metabolism, and apoptosis (2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 3Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem.

Deregulation of GSK-3 activity is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD), 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; ALLN, acetylleucine, leucine, norleucinal; DIV, days in vitro. 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; ALLN, acetylleucine, leucine, norleucinal; DIV, days in vitro. bipolar disorder, and Huntington disease (3Jope R.S.

In AD, GSK-3 has been shown to phosphorylate Tau at most of the hyperphosphorylated serine and threonine residues in paired helical filament Tau, both in cells (6Lovestone S. Reynolds C.H. Latimer D.

Furthermore, GSK-3 modulates β-amyloid production from its precursor amyloid precursor protein (11Phiel C.J. Wilson C.A. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) and its accumulation in the cytoplasm of pretangle neurons (12Shiurba R.A. Ishiguro K. Takahashi M. Sato K. Spooner E.T.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar), although there is weaker homology at the N- and C-terminal ends than the central portions. Both isoenzymes are the products of two independent genes (mapped to chromosome 19q12.3 and 3q13.3, respectively (15Hansen L. Arden K.C. Rasmussen S.B. Viars C.S. Vestergaard H. Hansen T. Moller A.M.

Anderton B.H. Genome. 1998; 41: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 160), and whereas the GSK-3α gene encodes a 51-kDa protein, the GSK-3β gene encodes a 47-kDa protein. Recently, a new alternative splice isoform of GSK-3β with an additional 13-amino-acid insert in the catalytic domain has also been described (17Mukai F. Ishiguro K. Sano Y. Fujita S.C. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the GSK-3β gene has been analyzed (18Lau K.F. Miller C.C. Anderton B.H. Shaw P.C. Genomics. 1999; 60: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and its promoter studied to identify variations that could be associated with abnormal function (19Russ C. Lovestone S. Powell J.F. Mol. Psychiatry. 2001; 6: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).GSK-3 can phosphorylate a variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, and its substrates include cytoskeletal proteins, transcription factors, and metabolic regulators. Thus, GSK-3 plays a prominent role in establishing and maintaining cell architecture, gene expression, and apoptosis (3Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Many GSK-3 substrates require prior phosphorylation by a priming kinase on a Ser or Thr residue four amino acids C-terminal to the GSK-3 target residue. Indeed, the crystal structure of human GSK-3β has provided a model for the binding of prephosphorylated substrates to the kinase (Protein Data Bank ID are 1I09 (20ter Haar E. Coll J.T. Austen D.A. Hsiao H.M. Swenson L. Jain J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and 1H8F (21Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)). Thus, the primed Ser/Thr is recognized by a positively charged “binding pocket” that facilitates the binding of primed substrates. Identifying the priming kinase is clearly of interest, and kinases such as cdk-5 (22Li T. Hawkes C. Qureshi H.Y. Kar S. Paudel H.K.

Alkalay I. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1066-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), or protein kinase A (27Singh T.J. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) could act as priming kinases for GSK-3 phosphorylation.GSK-3 is regulated at the post-translational level by phosphorylation, and autophosphorylation at Tyr-216 of GSK-3β or Tyr-276 of GSK-3α is necessary for its activation (28Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 29Lochhead P.A. Kinstrie R. Sibbet G. Rawjee T. Morrice N. Cleghon V. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 627-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). From the crystal structure, it has been proposed that unphosphorylated Tyr-216/276 blocks the access of primed substrates. Indeed, the published structure of phosphorylated GSK-3β (30Bax B. Carter P.S. Lewis C. Guy A.R. Bridges A. Tanner R. Pettman G. Mannix C. Culbert A.A. Brown M.J. Smith D.G. Reith A.D. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) shows that phosphorylated Tyr-216 suffers a conformational change that allows the primed substrate to bind the enzyme. In Dictyostelium, the Zaphod kinase activates GSK-3 by Tyr-phosphorylation (31Kim L. Liu J. Kimmel A.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), whereas in mammals, Fyn tyrosine kinase (32Lesort M. Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) or some related tyrosine kinase may be involved in this process. However, it seems that phosphorylation of these residues may also be the result of autophosphorylation (29Lochhead P.A. Kinstrie R. Sibbet G. Rawjee T. Morrice N. Cleghon V. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 627-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 33Cole A. Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).Inhibition of the enzyme can be achieved by two different mechanisms (2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). The first mechanism is triggered by insulin and growth factors, and it is mainly mediated by protein kinase B, which phosphorylates Ser-9 in GSK-3β and Ser-21 in GSK-3α. A model for this inhibition has been generated through structural studies (20ter Haar E. Coll J.T. Austen D.A. Hsiao H.M. Swenson L. Jain J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 21Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and accordingly, the phosphorylated Ser-9/21 binds as a competitive pseudosubstrate to the primed-binding site, inhibiting the binding of the protein and its ensuing phosphorylation. The second mechanism of GSK-3 inhibition involves the wingless (Wnt) signaling pathway. GSK-3 contributes to a multiprotein complex formed by axin and adenomatous polyposis coli, in which it is able to phosphorylate β-catenin, targeting it for proteasome degradation (34Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). Wnt proteins bind to the Frizzled receptor, activating the Dishevelled protein, which in turn inhibits GSK-3 activity by disrupting this multiprotein complex. As a consequence, β-catenin accumulates and translocates into the nucleus, where it activates transcription by interacting with certain transcription factors.In addition to these regulatory mechanisms, the mechanisms governing the turnover of GSK-3 may be critical in diseases in which GSK-3 activity is altered. The GSK-3β promoter is a TATA-less promoter with the characteristics of housekeeping genes, and with regard to Alzheimer disease, there are no reports of alterations in GSK-3β transcription (18Lau K.F. Miller C.C. Anderton B.H. Shaw P.C. Genomics. 1999; 60: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Russ C. Lovestone S. Powell J.F. Mol. Psychiatry. 2001; 6: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the degradation of GSK-3 is poorly understood. In this context, we have consistently observed additional lower apparent molecular weight bands in overexposed immunoblots probed with some anti-GSK-3 antibodies, suggesting the presence of specific proteolytic fragments. Here, we have examined the effects of calpain on the cleavage of GSK-3. First we demonstrate that GSK-3β is truncated by calpain in vitro, whereas GSK-3α is not such a good substrate. We then identified the kinase region that is cleaved by calpain and demonstrated that this cleavage of GSK-3 takes place in cortical neurons after glutamatergic stimulation. Together, these data demonstrate a new means of regulating GSK-3 with important implications for all its physiological and pathological roles.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies, Enzymes, and Reactives—The commercial antibodies used were: anti-GSK-3β/α (pS9/21) and anti-GSK-3β/α obtained from BioSource (Camarillo, CA); anti-p35/25 obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-His and anti-α-tubulin obtained from Sigma; and anti-NR2C (35Simpkins K.L. Guttmann R.P. Dong Y. Chen Z. Sokol S. Neumar R.W. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11322-11331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Calpain was purchased from Calbiochem (catalogue number 208718), GSK-3α was from Upstate-Millipore (Chicago, IL; catalogue number 14-492), and GSK-3β was from Sigma (catalogue number G1663). Ionomycin, aprotinin, and pepstatin were all obtained from Sigma, whereas MK801, ALLN, and calpeptin were from Calbiochem.Calpain Cleavage of GSK-3—Cortical mouse brain extracts were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1.0 mm EDTA. Samples were then incubated at 30 °C for several minutes with or without 5.0 mm CaCl2 and in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. The samples were then mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, electrophoresed, and Western blotted to identify the products of proteolysis by probing with antibodies against GSK-3. Commercial GSK-3 isoforms (0.5 μg) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.2 units calpain/ml. Samples were then incubated at 30 °C for several minutes in the presence or absence of 5.0 mm CaCl2 and 10 μm calpeptin. Samples were then mixed with Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 10 μm calpeptin and separated by electrophoresis.GSK-3 Activity Assay—Cortical mouse brain extracts were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1.0 mm EDTA. Samples were then incubated at 30 °C for several minutes in the presence or absence of 5.0 mm CaCl2 and 10 μm calpeptin. Reactions were terminated by adding a mixture of peptidase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 20 μm calpeptin. Extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were collected to assay GSK-3 activity. The GS1 peptide (YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQS*EDEE) in which Ser-21 is phosphorylated was used as a substrate as described previously (36Hernandez F. Borrell J. Guaza C. Avila J. Lucas J.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1529-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated at 30 °C with 30 μm GS1 peptide in the presence of 50 μm ATP (1,000 cpm/pmol of [γ-32P]ATP, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and either 10 mm NaCl or 10 mm LiCl. The assays were stopped by spotting aliquots onto P81 phosphocellulose paper, and the filters were processed as described previously (36Hernandez F. Borrell J. Guaza C. Avila J. Lucas J.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1529-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). GSK-3 activity was calculated as the difference between the activity in the presence of 10 mm NaCl and the activity in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. The results were expressed as the percentage of activity with respect to the wild-type extracts. Commercial GSK-3 isoforms (0.5 μg) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 units calpain/ml. Samples were then incubated at 30 °C for several minutes in the presence or absence of 5.0 mm CaCl2. The reactions were stopped with calpeptin 20 μm and a mixture of peptidase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). GSK-3 activity was then measured as described above in the presence or absence of LiCl at different concentrations (0.01–20 mm). GSK-3 activity was normalized to the total GSK-3 protein levels measured after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Dephosphorylation Experiments—Commercial GSK-3 isoenzymes were dephosphorylated with λ-phosphatase (BioLabs, IZASA SA, Barcelona, Spain) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of peptidase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) for 0.5 h at 30 °C to remove the adventitious phosphorylation that occurs during expression. The dephosphorylation of the protein was confirmed by Western blotting using the antibody anti-GSK-3β/α (pS9/21) and the anti-GSK-3β/α antibody as loading control.Primary Cultures—Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared according to modified versions of established procedures (37Hernandez F. Perez M. Lucas J.J. Mata A.M. Bhat R. Avila J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3801-3806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, pups were sacrificed at postnatal day 1, and the cortical tissue was dissected and dissociated individually from each pup with the papain dissociation system (Worthington Biochemical Corp.; Lakewood, NJ). Cortical neurons were maintained in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% B-27, 5% fetal calf serum, 0.5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and they were grown on 3 μg/ml laminin (Sigma) and 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine-coated plates. The cells were incubated in 95% air, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cytosine arabinoside (2.5 μm) was added to the cultures on the third day after seeding (DIV3) to inhibit the proliferation of non-neuronal cells, and the cells were used for experiments at DIV12.Drug Treatment—Dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) was dissolved in Me2SO, and the final concentration of Me2SO in the medium was 0.2–0.4%. NMDA and glutamate were dissolved in culture medium, and the drugs were added 30 min before the stimulation of NMDA receptors with 100 μm NMDA or 1 mm glutamate. Experiments were performed in the presence of glycine 100 μm.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were probed with the following primary monoclonal antibodies: anti-GSK-3β/α (1/1,000), anti-α-tubulin (1/5,000), anti-His (1/1,000), anti-NR2C (1/100), anti-p35/25 (1/200), and anti-GSK-3β/α (pS9/21) (1/200). The filters were incubated with the antibody at 4 °C overnight in 5% nonfat dried milk. The immunoreactive bands were detected with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (1/5,000; Invitrogen) and visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of GSK-3 was performed by densitometric scanning, and the densitometry values were obtained in the linear range of detection with these antibodies. These values were normalized with respect to the values obtained with an anti-α-tubulin antibody to correct for any deviation in protein loading or with respect to the values obtained with anti-tubulin antibody to correct for total protein content.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of the data were performed using one-way analysis of variance.RESULTSGSK-3 Is Cleaved by Calpain in Brain Extracts—We have previously observed that when immunoblots probed with some anti-GSK-3 antibodies are overexposed, additional bands smaller than the full-length GSK-3 isoenzymes (about 40–30 kDa) can be detected, suggesting the presence of proteolytic fragments. To test this possibility, we analyzed by Western blotting the pattern of GSK-3 bands and fragments in mouse brain tissue homogenized in the presence of Tris/EGTA. Although in the absence of Ca2+, no degradation of GSK-3 was observed (Fig. 1A), the addition of CaCl2 to these homogenates induced the time-dependent degradation of GSK-3 (Fig. 1A). Two breakdown products with apparent molecular masses of ∼40 (fragment I) and 30 (fragment II) kDa were observed, although the 30-kDa band was fainter. The Ca2+-induced degradation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by ALLN and calpeptin, two calpain inhibitors, with an IC50 of 11 and 60 nm, respectively (Fig. 1, B and D). To confirm that GSK-3 is proteolyzed by calpain, we studied the inhibition of the Ca2+-stimulated proteolysis of GSK-3 with selective inhibitors of different proteases. Neither aprotinin nor pepstatin, serine, and aspartic protease inhibitors, respectively, significantly inhibited the Ca2+-induced degradation of GSK-3 (Fig. 1, C and D), excluding the involvement of these types of proteases in the GSK-3 proteolysis. Taken together, these results indicated that elevated Ca2+ most probably activates calpain, which in turn cleaves GSK-3 (38Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar).We then investigated whether the truncation of GSK-3 affects its kinase activity. GSK-3 activity was assessed in the same manner as analyzed previously in brain extracts (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the Ca2+-treated extracts showed a significant increase (p < 0.02, 51.8 ± 6%) in GSK-3 activity (Fig. 1E) when compared with control extracts. Furthermore, the Ca2+-induced increase in GSK-3 activity was inhibited by calpeptin.Calpain Cleaves GSK-3α and GSK-3β at Their N-terminal End—To assess whether both GSK-3 isoenzymes were substrates for calpain, recombinant GSK-3α and GSK-3β were incubated with the protease. Both isoenzymes were cleaved by calpain, producing two calpain-derived fragments (Fig. 2A). When these fragments were analyzed in the same gel (Fig. 2C), we observed that both isoenzymes produce a fragment of apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa (fragment II), whereas fragment I of GSK-3α had a slightly higher apparent molecular mass (42 kDa) than that from the β-isoform (40 kDa). Quantification of these proteolytic products (Fig. 2B) showed that both full-length isoforms were rapidly digested by calpain (Fig. 2B, open circles). However, fragment I generated from the β-isoform is a better substrate for calpain than the one generated from the α-isoform since after 5 min of calpain digestion, fragment I generated from GSK-3β represented about 25% of the total GSK-3β, whereas in the same experimental conditions, the equivalent fragment represented the 60% of the GSK-3α protein.FIGURE 2In vitro proteolysis of GSK-3β and GSK-3α by calpain. A, representative immunoblots of GSK-3β and GSK-3α digested with calpain (0.2 units/ml) for up to 30 min are shown. No degradation was observed in the absence of calcium or in the presence of calcium and calpeptin. All samples were incubated with calpain. Arrows and asterisks represent fragment I (one asterisk) and fragment II (two asterisks). B, quantified data of GSK-3 isoform are expressed in terms of the percentage of the total enzyme present in each treatment versus time (○, full-length isoforms; □, fragment I; ▵, fragment II). C, the fragments were analyzed in the same gel, and it can be seen that both isoenzymes produced a fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa (fragment II, two asterisks), whereas the fragment I (40 kDa, one asterisk) has a slightly higher apparent molecular mass (42 kDa) in the case of the GSK-3α than in the case of the β-isoform. D, calpain and His-GSK-3β or His-GSK-3α were incubated in the presence or absence of 5 mm CaCl2 with or without 10 μm calpeptin for 0.5 min. N-terminal His-labeled proteins were analyzed in Western blots probed with the anti-His antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The recombinant GSK-3 isoenzymes used were His-tagged at their N-terminal ends, and when assayed as above and probed with an antibody against the His tag, the breakdown products generated from both GSK-3 isoforms were not detected, indicating that the N-terminal end was that removed by calpain (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, this confirms that calpain digests both full-length isoforms rapidly to generate fragment I. Indeed, the antibody that recognizes the His-tagged epitope is unable to detect the full-length GSK-3 isoforms 2 min after exposure to calpain.Truncated GSK-3 Isoenzymes Are Active Kinases—To determine whether calpain-mediated GSK-3 proteolysis alters its kinase activity, the effects of calpain on recombinant GSK-3 isoenzymes were studied. The study was performed with GSK-3 isoforms treated with calpain for 0.5–5 min. Fig. 3A shows that the GSK-3β kinase activity increased over incubation time. Thus, calpain-mediated proteolysis of recombinant GSK-3β showed a significant (p < 0.01) increase in GSK-3 activity (330.1 ± 7.3% at 5 min) when compared with the untreated enzyme. When the same experiment was carried out with the GSK-3α isoform, a similar increase in kinase activity was not observed. These data demonstrate that the GSK-3 fragments are catalytic and suggest that calpain-mediated proteolysis selectively augments the kinase activity of the β isoform.FIGURE 3Effect of GSK-3 truncation on enzymatic activity. A, recombinant calpain and GSK-3β or GSK-3α were incubated in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 for 0.5, 2, and 5 min. Then, the enzymatic activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shaded bars represent the GSK-3 activity obtained before calpain treatment (*, p < 0.01). B, levels of Ser-9/21 phosphorylation present in commercial isoforms. GSK-3 isoforms were treated with phosphatase-λ for 30 min, and then the samples were immunoblotted (IB) and probed with the anti-P-Ser-9/21-GSK-3β/α antibody (upper panel) or the anti-GSK-3β/α antibody as a loading control. C, inhibition of full-length GSK-3 isoenzymes (CONTROL) and truncated GSK-3β and GSK-3α forms after 0.5 or 5 min of calpain treatment. The table shows the IC50 values for Li+ inhibition. Dose-response profiles for GSK-3 activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of lithium (0.01–20 mm) were fitted to sigmoidal curves, and the IC50 were values calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A well established mechanism that increases GSK-3 activity involves dephosphorylating the Ser-21/9 present in the N-terminal end of GSK-3. To validate the differential effect of calpain on each isoform, it was important to investigate whether the recombinant enzymes were similarly phosphorylated at Ser-21/9. We found that although recombinant GSK-3β was phosphorylated at Ser-9, there was very little phosphorylation of Ser-21 in the α-isoform (Fig. 3B). These results were confirmed by treating GSK-3 isoforms with phosphatase-λ, which abolished the binding of the anti-P-Ser 21/9-GSK-3α/β antibody without altering the total a"

By adding extra electrons via bismuth alloying, we showed that both the structural stability and the superconducting properties of such films can be tuned. The phase boundary (upper critical field) between the superconducting vortex state and the normal state indicates an anomalous suppression of superconducting order just below the critical temperature, T c . This suppression varies systematically with the film thickness and the bismuth content and can be parametrized in terms of a characteristic temperature, T c * (less than T c ), that is inversely proportional to the scattering mean free path. The results indicate that the isotropic nature of the superconductive pairing in bulk lead-bismuth alloys is altered in the quantum regime."

One prominent form of the Long QT syndrome has been linked to mutations in the HERG gene (KCNH2) that encodes the voltage-dependent delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr). In order to search for HERG-interacting proteins important for HERG maturation and trafficking, we conducted a proteomics screen using myc-tagged HERG transfected into cardiac (HL-1) and non-cardiac (human embryonic kidney 293) cell lines. A partial list of putative HERG-interacting proteins includes several known components of the cytosolic chaperone system, including Hsc70 (70-kDa heat shock cognate protein), Hsp90 (90-kDa heat shock protein), Hdj-2, Hop (Hsp-organizing protein), and Bag-2 (BCL-associated athanogene 2). In addition, two membrane-integrated proteins were identified, calnexin and FKBP38 (38-kDa FK506-binding protein, FKBP8). We show that FKBP38 immunoprecipitates and co-localizes with HERG in our cellular system. Importantly, small interfering RNA knock down of FKBP38 causes a reduction of HERG trafficking, and overexpression of FKBP38 is able to partially rescue the LQT2 trafficking mutant F805C. We propose that FKBP38 is a co-chaperone of HERG and contributes via the Hsc70/Hsp90 chaperone system to the trafficking of wild type and mutant HERG potassium channels.

Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar) and has been linked to genetic mutations in the KCNH2 gene that encodes the HERG subunit. The HERG channel is a tetramer of HERG subunits that comprises the α-subunit of the voltage-dependent delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) (2Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). To date, more than 200 naturally occurring LQT2 mutants have been identified that result in either abnormal HERG channel function or a decrease in cell surface localization. Approximately 13% of these HERG mutations are characterized as trafficking-deficient mutants and represent the most dominant mechanism for the loss of HERG function in LQT2 (3Anderson C.L. Delisle B.P. Anson B.D. Kilby J.A. Will M.L. Tester D.J. Gong Q. Zhou Z. Ackerman M.J. January C.T. Circulation. 2006; 113: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). HERG trafficking mutants represent a potential target for pharmacological intervention as roughly 70% can be rescued, suggesting that the folding defects might be subtle (3Anderson C.L. Delisle B.P. Anson B.D. Kilby J.A. Will M.L. Tester D.J. Gong Q. Zhou Z. Ackerman M.J. January C.T. Circulation. 2006; 113: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions wild type (WT) HERG exhibits two bands on Western blot analysis, with the generation of both bands involving asparagine (Asn)-linked glycosylation (4Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The core-glycosylated, immature form is represented by a 135-kDa band and is present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas the fully glycosylated mature protein is observable as a 155-kDa band and represents HERG either in the Golgi apparatus or at the cell surface (5Petrecca K. Atanasiu R. Akhavan A. Shrier A. J. Physiol. 1999; 515 (, Pt. 1,): 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6Gong Q. Anderson C.L. January C.T. Zhou Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283 (-H84): H77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Comparison of the intensity of these two bands provides a useful assay of HERG trafficking. The prevailing view is that mutants with trafficking deficiencies are recognized and retained as misfolded proteins by the quality control machinery of the ER (7Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that HERG forms complexes with the molecular chaperones Hsc70 (70-kDa heat shock cognate protein), Hsp90 (90-kDa heat shock protein) (8Ficker E. Dennis A.T. Wang L. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92 (-e100): e87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and calnexin (9Gong Q. Jones M.A. Zhou Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4069-4074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which are known to be important for polypeptide folding, sorting, transport, and degradation (10McClellan A.J. Tam S. Kaganovich D. Frydman J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 11Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Res. 2003; 92 (-e100): e87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that two LQT2-trafficking mutants, R752W and G601S, also interacted with Hsc70 and Hsp90 when retained in the ER and these interactions were prolonged relative to WT HERG. The recovery of channel trafficking and function by temperature reduction or pharmacological stabilization was tightly coupled to the dissociation of channel-chaperone complexes (8Ficker E. Dennis A.T. Wang L. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92 (-e100): e87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the Hsc70 and Hsp90 chaperone system is important for the folding of HERG and that regulation of exit from the ER is mechanistically linked to the dissociation of HERG from this complex. The Hsc70/Hsp90 network has been characterized more extensively for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (12Wang X. Venable J. LaPointe P. Hutt D.M. Koulov A.V. Coppinger J.

Cell. 2005; 16: 5891-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the protein complexes that form between HERG and molecular chaperones to facilitate HERG folding, maturation, and retention. To identify additional possible HERG-interacting chaperones we conducted a proteomic analysis. This revealed several known cytosolic chaperones, including Hsc70, Hsp90, Hdj-2, Hsp-organizing protein (Hop), and Bag-2 as well as two transmembrane proteins that included calnexin and FKBP38 (38-kDa FK506-binding protein, FKBP8). FKBP38 is of particular interest in that it is almost entirely exposed to the cytosol and is related to the known tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain co-chaperone FKBP52 (23Peattie D.A. Harding M.W. Fleming M.A. DeCenzo M.T. Lippke J.A. Livingston D.J. Benasutti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10974-10978Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It contains an N-terminal region of unknown function, an FK506 binding peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase domain, a TPR domain predicted to interact with Hsc70 and/or Hsp90, a calmodulin binding motif, and a C-terminal transmembrane anchor (24Lam E. Martin M. Wiederrecht G. Gene. 1995; 160: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The TPR domain of FKBP38 is closely related to the TPR domain present in co-chaperones of Hsc70 and Hsp90. Some co-chaperone TPR domains, such as those in Hop, specifically distinguish between Hsc70 and Hsp90; others, such as that in CHIP, can bind either Hsc70 or Hsp90 (11Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). The structural basis of Hsc70 and Hsp90 binding by TPR domains is known (25Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), and the residues required are absolutely conserved in FKBP38. We hypothesize that as a membrane protein FKBP38 may provide a direct link between the cytosolic chaperones and ER retention or export mechanisms of HERG. Here we characterize the biochemical and functional effect of FKBP38 on WT HERG and a HERG trafficking mutant. Our results indicate that FKBP38 is important for the trafficking of WT HERG and is capable of rescuing the LQT2 HERG trafficking mutant F805C. Preparation of cDNA Constructs—The generation of N-terminal Myc-tagged and N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged HERG has been described previously (26Akhavan A. Atanasiu R. Shrier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40105-40112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The HERG missense mutant F805C was engineered using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and a HERG-C cassette as the PCR template as described previously (26Akhavan A. Atanasiu R. Shrier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40105-40112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cDNA of HA-tagged FKBP38 was kindly provided by Dr. Nakayama (Fukuoka, Japan) (27Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293 and HL-1 cells were used and maintained as previously described (26Akhavan A. Atanasiu R. Shrier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40105-40112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfections were carried out using either Lipofectamine or Lipofectamine 2000 as described by the manufacturer. HEK-293 cells were not used beyond 30 passages. Stable Cell Line Generation—A stable cell line for WT HERG was generated using the G-418 selection method. Briefly, transfected cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 800 μg/ml of G-418 (Invitrogen) for 10 to 15 days. G-418-resistant colonies were selected by their protein expression levels and purity as determined by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. Mass Spectrometry Analysis and Data Base Mining—Four proteomic screens of immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged HERG transfected into cardiac (HL-1) (28Claycomb W.C. Lanson Jr., N.A. Stallworth B.S.

J. Physiol. 2004; 286 (-H829): H823Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and non-cardiac (HEK-293) cell lines were performed. The Myc-immunoprecipitated HERG-bound complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie blue. Individual bands were destained, excised, reduced, sulfur-alkylated, and digested with trypsin using a robotic digester (Micromass) at the Protein Unit Facility of the Genome Quebec Proteomics Platform. The resultant peptide mixtures were analyzed by direct on-line liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The MS/MS spectra were evaluated using Mascot software (Matrix Science) to identify tryptic peptide sequences matched to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein and nucleotide data bases (dbEST) with a confidence level of 95% or greater (30Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J.C. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6814) Google Scholar). Peptide sequence tags were generated from the MS/MS spectra as described (31Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). The location and function of each identified protein were assigned using NCBI, Swiss-Prot, InterProHome, and InterProScan data bases. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were washed two times with cold PBS and then incubated in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 75 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8) plus a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for a minimum of 15 min. Cells were homogenized by pipetting, harvested, and then left on ice for an additional 15 min with occasional vortexing. Detergent-insoluble material was sedimented at 16,000 × g for 30 min after which the resulting supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was determined with a detergent-compatible assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, samples of 0.5 to 1 mg of protein were incubated in a volume of 0.5 to 1 ml and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either monoclonal mouse α-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) (1:100), monoclonal mouse α-HA (Covance) (1:100), or polyclonal rabbit α-FKBP38 (1:200) provided by Dr. Nakayama (Fukuoka, Japan). The immunoprecipitation samples were incubated with Protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h after which the beads were washed extensively and then resuspended in sample buffer 2× (12% 0.5 m Tris, pH 6.8, 5% β mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 20% SDS, Bromphenol blue). Samples were resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide SDS gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed extensively, and then incubated with goat α-mouse/rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After extensive washing the membranes were visualized on x-ray films using the ECL Plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Overexpression and siRNA—For all overexpression experiments, HEK-293 cells grown on 35-mm dishes were transiently transfected at 70-80% confluence with WT or F805C HERG and varying amounts of HA-FKBP38 (0, 0.2, or 0.4 μg) and an appropriate amount of empty vector to equalize total amount of transfected cDNA. After 48 h, cells were lysed as described above and equal amounts of protein were loaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. For siRNA experiments, siRNA oligonucleotides targeting the 5′-AAGAGUGGCUGGACAUUCUGG-3′ sequence in the open reading frame of human FKBP38 mRNA and a control double-stranded RNA with a corresponding scrambled sequence (5′-AAGCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUC-3′) were obtained from Dharmacon Research (Lafyette, CO) based on Ref. 27Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar. HEK-293 cells stably expressing Myc-HERG-WT were seeded at low confluence (20-30%) on 35-mm dishes and transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides according to the manufacturer’s instructions using Lipofectamine and Lipofectamine Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed 2, 4, or 6 days post-transfection and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described above. Immunolocalization—HEK-293 cells stably expressing WT HERG-Myc were seeded onto gelatin/fibronectin-coated coverslips. 24 h post-seeding, cells were washed with PBS and then fixed for 15 min with 4% formaldehyde at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Cells were then washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by PBS containing 10% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature after which cells were incubated with blocking solution containing either α-Myc (1:1000), α-KDEL (1:600), or α-FKBP38 (1:1000) antibody for 1 h. Coverslips were extensively washed before being incubated with blocking solution containing either Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated mouse secondary antibody or Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody at 1:400. After washing with PBS the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Immuno-Fluore Mounting Medium (ICN Biomedicals). Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 automated inverted microscope. Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—Densitometric analysis was carried out using the digital imaging program ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Each band was quantified by a mean pixel value after subtraction of background. Pixel values for the upper and lower HERG bands and the FKBP38 band were normalized to the loading control protein PP2A. For both the siRNA and overexpression experiments, HERG trafficking efficiency is represented by the ratio of the normalized HERG upper band to the total normalized HERG intensity (HERG upper + HERG lower). All experiments were repeated in triplicate. Paired t tests were used to compare groups of data to determine significant. HERG Interacts with Cytosolic Chaperones—To search for other possible chaperones or co-chaperones that interact with HERG we conducted a total of four proteomic screens of immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged HERG transfected into cardiac (HL-1) (28Claycomb W.C.

Constantin P.E. Claycomb W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286 (-H829): H823Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and non-cardiac (HEK-293) cell lines. The Myc-immunoprecipitated HERG-bound complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, excised, subjected to tryptic digestion, and then analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry at the Montreal Genome Centre. Identified HERG-interacting chaperones and co-chaperones include Hsc70, Hsp90, Hdj2, Hop, Bag-2, and calnexin (Table 1). In addition to these abundant cytosolic chaperones we identified the immunophilin FKBP38, a putative co-chaperone that may interact with the Hsc70/Hsp90 chaperone network involved in the HERG processing pathway.TABLE 1Identified HERG-interacting chaperones and co-chaperonesProteinOther namesSpeciesaHuman protein was found in immunoprecipitations conducted in HEK-293 cells.

Open table in a new tab HERG and FKBP38 Co-immunoprecipitate and Co-localize—Although FKBP38 is ubiquitously expressed, it is found in greatest abundance in the brain and the heart (24Lam E. Martin M. Wiederrecht G. Gene. 1995; 160: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To confirm that there is an interaction between HERG and FKBP38 we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments. First, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged WT HERG and then lysed and immunoprecipitated with an antibody against endogenous FKBP38. As shown in Fig. 1A, both the mature and immature forms of HERG were immunoprecipitated with the α-FKBP38 antibody. It remains unclear whether FKBP38 truly interacts with both forms of the HERG protein, given that most chaperones release their substrate once it has reached its native state. It seems conceivable that FKBP38 is bound to HERG even after its release from the ER. This might be expected if FKBP38 is involved in a late HERG folding stage or in the ER exit of HERG. Second, we transiently transfected HEK-293 cells with HA vector alone, HA-tagged WT HERG, Myc vector alone, or Myc-tagged WT HERG and then lysed and immunoprecipitated with either α-HA or α-Myc antibody. Fig. 1B shows the presence of a band at ∼62 kDa that corresponds to FKBP38, indicating that endogenous FKBP38 is immunoprecipitated with both Myc-tagged and HA-tagged WT HERG but not with the vectors alone. Finally, immunoprecipitation studies were conducted in HEK-293 cells alone or stably expressing Myc-tagged WT HERG and in AP-1 cells stably expressing the HA-tagged sodium-hydrogen exchanger NheI. Fig. 1C shows that stably expressed Myc-tagged HERG can precipitate endogenous FKBP38 whereas the stably expressed HA-tagged sodium-hydrogen exchanger NheI cannot. Taken together these results indicate that HERG and FKBP38 do indeed interact and predict that the two proteins are present in the same cellular compartments. FKBP38 primarily localizes to the outer membrane of the mitochondria through its C-terminal membrane anchor where it is proposed to play a role in the regulation of apoptosis through its interaction with Bcl-2 (27Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Recent immunofluorescence and cell fractionation data indicate that FKBP38 resides at both the ER and mitochondrial membranes (27Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 32Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghanel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J-U. Fischer G.

To first confirm the ER localization of FKBP38 in our system we performed immunolocalization experiments in HEK-293 and HL-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 there is overlap between the ER marker (α-KDEL antibody) and FKBP38 indicating that FKBP38 is localized to the ER as well as the mitochondria. To determine whether HERG and FKBP38 co-localize in our cell system we co-stained HEK-293 cells stably expressing Myc-tagged HERG with an α-Myc antibody (mouse) and an α-FKBP38 antibody (rabbit). Fig. 3A displays the clear overlap between the two proteins indicating that they co-localize in HEK-293 cells. To determine whether these two proteins also co-localize in a more physiological system, we transfected HA-tagged HERG into a cardiac cell line (HL-1) and co-stained with an α-HA antibody for HERG and an α-FKBP38 antibody for endogenous FKBP38. Fig. 3B shows that similar to what was found in the HEK-293 cells, when the HL-1 cells were transfected with HERG there is co-localization of HERG and FKBP38 that appears as a perinuclear staining pattern (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results show that FKBP38 is expressed in the ER where it co-localizes with HERG.FIGURE 3HERG co-localizes with FKBP38 in a cardiac (HL-1) and a non-cardiac (HEK-293) cell line. A, immunolocalization experiments were performed in HEK-293 cells stably expressing Myc-tagged HERG. HERG and FKBP38 were visualized using a monoclonal α-Myc and polyclonal α-FKBP38 primary antibody followed by Alexa488 (green)/Alexa633 (red)-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively. B, HL-1 cells transfected with HA-tagged HERG were visualized as described for panel A, except that α-HA was used instead of α-Myc for HERG visualization. For panels A and B the third panel represents a merged image to demonstrate the overlap of the proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FKBP38 Knock Down Reduces HERG Trafficking—To determine whether the interaction between HERG and FKBP38 has a role in the trafficking of HERG we used siRNA to reduce the level of FKBP38 expression in the HEK-293 cell model. Under control conditions, both the immature, core glycosylated ER form and the mature complex glycosylated form of HERG were observed by Western blot at days 2, 4, and 6 post-transfection. The targeted siRNA reduction of FKBP38 caused a marked diminution of FKBP38 expression by 2 days post-transfection whereas a double-stranded scrambled oligonucleotide had no effect on the expression level of FKBP38 (Fig. 4A). Importantly, this FKBP38 knock down on day 2 led to a statistically significant reduction in the HERG trafficking efficiency relative to control (HG upper/HG total) on day 4 (15.0 ± 1.8 relative to control 36.8 ± 8.4 arbitrary units (AU); p = 0.03) and day 6 (24.6 ± 1.24 relative to control 41.5 ± 5.5 AU; p = 0.02; Fig. 4B). We attribute the delay in the siRNA-induced FKBP38 reduction of HERG trafficking efficiency to the relative stabilities of FKBP38 and HERG. HERG is a stable protein with a half-life of ∼12-16 h at the cell surface; thus, a maximal diminution of mature HERG would not be expected on day 2 when FKBP38 levels are minimal but rather at the next time point, on day 4 as observed. Thus, the reduction of FKBP38 expression results in a decrease in the efficiency of HERG maturation. FKBP38 Rescues Trafficking of F805C—Given that siRNA knock down of FKBP38 reduced HERG maturation, we questioned whether overexpression of FKBP38 would augment HERG maturation and/or rescue a HERG trafficking mutant. To test these possibilities, we overexpressed HA-tagged FKBP38 in the presence of either WT HERG or the HERG trafficking mutant F805C. The F805C mutation is present in the cyclic nucleotide binding domain (34Delisle B.P. Anderson C.L. Balijepalli R.C. Anson B.D. Kamp T.J. January C.T. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1985589004,"H-NS inhibits transcription by forming repressing nucleoprotein complexes next to promoters. We investigated repression by binding of H-NS within the transcription unit using the bgl and proU operons. Repression of both operons requires a downstream regulatory element (DRE) in addition to an upstream element (URE). In bgl, H-NS binds to a region located between 600 to 700 bp downstream of the transcription start site, whereas in proU the DRE extends up to position +270. We show that binding of H-NS to the bgl-DRE inhibits transcription initiation at a step before open complex formation, as shown before for proU. This was shown by determining the occupancy of the bgl transcription unit by RNA polymerases, expression analysis of bgl and proU reporter constructs, and chloroacetaldehyde footprinting of RNA polymerase promoter complexes. The chloroacetaldehyde footprinting also revealed that RNA polymerase is “poised” at the osmoregulated σ70-dependent proU promoter at low osmolarity, whereas at high osmolarity poising of RNA polymerase and repression by H-NS are reduced. Furthermore, repression by H-NS via the URE and DRE is synergistic, and the efficiency of repression by H-NS via the DRE inversely correlates with the promoter activity. Repression is high for a promoter of low activity, whereas it is low for a strong promoter. Inefficient repression of strong promoters by H-NS via a DRE may account for high induction levels of proU at high osmolarity and for bgl upon disruption of the URE.

Oligomerization of H-NS is important for repression (13Rimsky S. Zuber F. Buckle M. Buc H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In solution H-NS is presumably a dimer, which binds to AT-rich and curved DNA sequences with moderate specificity (Ref. 1Dorman C.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar and references therein). After binding to such “nucleation sites,” H-NS occupies further low affinity sites resulting in the formation of extended nucleoprotein complexes (1Dorman C.J. Nat. Rev.

Thus, when binding close to a promoter, H-NS represses transcription initiation by trapping of RNA polymerase at the promoter or by excluding binding of RNA polymerase (1Dorman C.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 13Rimsky S. Zuber F. Buckle M. Buc H. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2388-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In both cases binding of H-NS to an AT-rich curved DNA upstream of the promoter allows H-NS to form a bridge to a DNA sequence downstream to the promoter and to zip the two double strands that flank the promoter together. Repression by DNA looping is further supported by a biophysical analysis, in which it was demonstrated that one dimer of H-NS can contact two DNA double strands (20Dame R.T. Noom M.C. Wuite G.J.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Repression by H-NS is relieved gene specifically. In several cases a transcription factor binds close to the promoter and acts as an anti-repressor, presumably by disrupting the repressing nucleoprotein complex formed by H-NS (1Dorman C.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 15Schroöder O. Wagner R. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 945-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Relief of repression can also occur by a temperature-dependent change in the DNA curvature, as shown for virF (1Dorman C.J. Nat. Rev.

Likewise, mutations that disrupt the URE completely derepress bgl (40Lopilato J. Wright A. Drlica K. Riley M. The Bacterial Chromosome. 1990: 435-444Google Scholar, 44Reynolds A.E. Mahadevan S.

A. 1992; 89: 1244-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, repression by H-NS mediated via the DRE is affected by termination factor Rho and by translation, suggesting that transcription elongation and repression by H-NS influence each other (27Dole S. Nagarajavel V. Schnetz K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As in the case of proU, highly specific repression of bgl by H-NS could not be mimicked in vitro, where it was merely 4-5-fold (46Schnetz K. Wang J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).In this study we addressed the role of the DREs in repression of bgl and proU by H-NS. In bgl, as shown before for proU, H-NS inhibits a step of transcription initiation before open complex formation. Further parallels of repression of proU and bgl by H-NS include synergy in repression via the DRE and the URE. In addition, the efficiency of repression via the DREs depends on the promoter activity. Only promoters of low activity are effectively repressed. These and further data led us to propose a model for highly specific repression of bgl and proU by H-NS and for osmo-induction of proU. According to this model, a moderate increase of the promoter activity as it occurs at high osmolarity at the proU promoter or by disruption of the URE in bgl will reduce repression via the DRE. This in turn will result in a further increase in the promoter activity and, thus, efficient induction. Reduced repression via the DRE upon increased transcription may involve remodeling of the repressing H-NS-DNA complex by RNA polymerase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Plasmids, and Expression Assays—Escherichia coli K-12 strains used in this study are described in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) Footprinting—E. coli strain S541 and its isogenic Δhns mutant (S3346) were transformed with the relevant plasmids (see “Results”). A fresh overnight culture was used to inoculate 8 ml of LB, LB with 0.01 m NaCl, or LB with 0.3 m NaCl to an A600 of 0.1. Plasmids were selected with ampicillin. The cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5 with aeration, after which the cells were spun down and resuspended in 8 ml of M9 minimal medium with vitamin B1 and casamino acids. Rifampicin was added to a concentration of 200 μg/ml, and the cells were shaken at 37 °C for 5 min where indicated. Chloroacetaldehyde footprinting was performed essentially as described (48Guerin M. Leng M. Rahmouni A.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5397-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Chloroacetaldehyde (50% in water from FLUKA) was added to a final concentration of 3%, and the cells were shaken at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were spun down and washed once with 8 ml of M9 minimal medium. Then the plasmid was isolated by alkaline lysis, and the CAA modifications were analyzed by primer extension. To this end the amount of 200 fmol of 32P-end-labeled primer was added, and the plasmid DNA was denatured with 0.3 m NaOH by heating at 90 °C for 5 min, allowed to cool to room temperature, and ethanol-precipitated. The pellet was resuspended in Klenow buffer (New England Biolabs, Inc.), incubated at 45 °C for 5 min for primer annealing, and snap-cooled. Then 10 μl of dNTPs (1 mm each) and 2 units of Klenow (exo-) (New England Biolabs, Inc.) were added, and the samples were incubated at 45 °C for 12 min for primer extension. After ethanol precipitation the pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of formamide loading buffer (80% formamide, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue), and 5 μl were loaded onto a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Quantitative PCR—For chromatin immunoprecipitation, 40-ml cultures of strain S541/pKD49 and its isogenic hns-206::amp derivative S614 were grown in LB ampicillin to an A600 of 0.5. For cross-linking, formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the cultures were incubated at room temperature for 20 min with occasional mixing. The reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 m glycine to a final concentration of 0.45 m. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.9% NaCl) and once with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20% sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA) (49Lin D.C. Grossman A.D. Cell. 1998; 92: 675-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 4 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Further lysis was done by two freeze-thaw cycles. Then 500 μl of FA lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added, and the sample was sonicated to shear the chromatin to an average size of ∼500 bp. The cell debris was removed by centrifuging in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, and 100 μl of the supernatant was used. Immunoprecipitation and quantitation of precipitated DNA by quantitative PCR was carried out as described (50Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of mouse monoclonal antibody against the β-subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase (Neoclone) and 5 μl of 50% (v:v, in TBS) Ultralink Protein A/G Silica (Pierce) beads were added and incubated at room temperature for 90 min on an end-over-end rotator. The beads were washed twice with 700 μl of FA lysis buffer and once each with FA lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, ChIP wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH8, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and TE. The DNA was then eluted with 100 μl of ChIP elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) by incubating at 65 °C for 10 min. The immunoprecipitated DNA and an aliquot of the total chromatin was decross-linked by adding 100 ml of TE and ChIP elution buffer, respectively, 8 μl of Pronase (20 mg/ml in TBS) each, and incubating at 45 °C for 2 h and at 65 °C for 6 h. The decross-linked DNA was phenol-extracted, precipitated with ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 150 μl of TE. The decross-linked immunoprecipitated DNA and a 1:250 dilution of the decross-linked total chromatin were used in quantitative PCR using an Applied Biosystems 7700 sequence detector. The apparent cross-linking efficiency at a particular region was calculated as the ratio of PCR product from the immunoprecipitated sample to the amount of PCR product in the input sample before immunoprecipitation. Each apparent cross-linking efficiency was normalized with the apparent cross-linking efficiency at a control region, yabN-ORF (open reading frame), from the same experiment to obtain relative RNA polymerase occupancy (-fold over yabN-ORF) (51Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6458-6470Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Four independent cultures (wild type (wt) and hns) each were grown and immunoprecipitated. PCR quantitation was done twice for each immunoprecipitation. For quantitative PCR the following primers pairs were used: yabN, CTAATCTGGTCTATTTCGCTG and TCTCTCCTGTATGCCACTG; bgl fragment 1, CTGGCGAAAGAATTAACTCAAGTGG and GGGTAAAGCCGCTGGATATCCCACA; bgl fragment 2, GGATATCCAGCGGCTTTACC and AGATGTGTAACCAGTCGCTGATAAC; bgl-fragment 3, CACATCTGAAGTTTTTATCCTGGCG and CGCACGCGCTCTATATTTATGGCTA.RESULTSH-NS Bound to the bgl-DRE and proU-DRE Weakly Affects Transcription Elongation—Repression by binding of H-NS within the transcription unit could be the result of H-NS acting as a roadblock to the transcribing RNA polymerase or of in"

With these substrates, extracts of fibroblasts derived from Morquio patients lack or have greatly reduced activities for galactitol-6-sulfate, N-acetylgalactosaminitol-6-sulfate, and 6-sulfated tetrasaccharides but have normal activity for N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate and its alditol; those derived from a patient with a newly discovered mucopolysaccharidosis have greatly reduced activity for N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate and its alditol but normal activity for galactitol-6-sulfate, N-acetylgalactosaminitol-6-sulfate, and the 6-sulfated tetrasaccharides. These findings demonstrate the existence of two different hexosamine-6-sulfate sulfatases, specific for the glucose or galactose configuration of their substrates. Their respective deficiencies, causing inability to degrade keratan sulfate and heparan sulfate in one case and keratan sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate in the other, are responsible for different clinical phenotypes."

Findings of this study present a new paradigm that addresses the regulation of c-Src under neurodegenerative conditions. c-Src is the product of the Src gene and has been found both overexpressed and highly activated in a number of human cancers. The relationship between c-Src activation and cancer progression is significant. Furthermore, c-Src is thought play a role in the acquisition of the invasive and metastatic phenotype. Thus, c-Src represents a major focus in cancer research (1Ishizawar R. Parsons S.J. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 209-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The Src protein was the first tyrosine kinase to be discovered. Today, tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling has been implicated in a wide variety of pathways that regulate mammalian cell function. Beyond cancer, c-Src is now known to regulate several aspects of cellular function including osteoclastic bone resorption (2Miyazaki T. Tanaka S. Sanjay A. Baron R. Mod. Rheumatol. 2006; 16: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and gap junction (3Lau A.F. Sci. STKE 2005. 2005; : pe33Google Scholar). c-Src is heavily expressed in the brain (4Soriano P.

Res. 1989; 24: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Differentiating rodent neurons express high levels of c-Src. In neurons and astrocytes, c-Src is present at 15–20 times higher levels than that found in fibroblasts. The specific activity of the c-Src protein from neuronal cultures is 6–12 times higher than that from the astrocyte cultures, suggesting a key function of this protein in neurons (6Brugge J.S. Cotton P.C. Queral A.E. Barrett J.N. Nonner D. Keane R.W. Nature. 1985; 316: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Initially, c-Src was identified as being important in growth cone-mediated neurite extension and synaptic plasticity (7Maness P.F. Aubry M. Shores C.G. Frame L. Pfenninger K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5001-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and in neuronal differentiation (8Ingraham C.A. Cox M.E. Ward D.C. Fults D.W. Maness P.F. Mol. Chem.

Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). Our pursuit for characterization of the neuroprotective mechanisms of tocotrienols led to the first evidence demonstrating that rapid c-Src activation plays a central role in executing glutamate-induced neurodegeneration (9Khanna S.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In this study we sought to examine the mechanisms that regulate inducible c-Src activity in glutamate-challenged HT4 neural cells. Materials—The following materials were obtained from the source indicated: l-glutamic acid monosodium salt; dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma); and PP2 and PP3 (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). For cell culture, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, fetal calf serum, and penicillin and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Culture dishes were obtained from Nunc (Denmark). Cell Culture—Mouse hippocampal HT4 neural cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 as described previously (10Sen C.K.

The cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 40 μm cystine, and antibiotics (100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air in a humidified incubator. All of the experiments were carried out 24 h after plating (20Khanna S. Roy S. Ryu H. Bahadduri P. Swaan P.W.

Glutamate Treatment—Immediately before experiments, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with serum and antibiotics. Glutamate (10 mm) was added to the medium as an aqueous solution (10Sen C.K. Khanna S. Roy S. Packer L. J. Biol.

Cell Viability—The viability of cells in culture was assessed by measuring the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (23Han D. Sen C.K. Roy S. Kobayashi M.S. Tritschler H.J. Packer L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273 (-R1778): R1771PubMed Google Scholar) from cells to medium 18–24 h following glutamate treatment using the in vitro toxicology assay kit from Sigma. The protocol has been described in detail in previous reports (23Han D. Sen C.K. Roy S. Kobayashi M.S. Tritschler H.J. Packer L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273 (-R1778): R1771PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, LDH leakage was determined using the following equation: % of total LDH leaked = (LDH activity in the cell culture media/total LDH activity), where total LDH activity = LDH activity in cell monolayer + LDH activity of detached cells + LDH activity in the cell culture medium (10Sen C.K.

As previously described (21Khanna S. Roy S. Slivka A. Craft T.K. Chaki S. Rink C. Notestine M.A. DeVries A.C. Parinandi N.L. Sen C.K. Stroke. 2005; 36: 2258-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), microinjection was performed using a micromanipulator Femtojet B 5247 and Injectman NI 2 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with 80 hPa pressure and 0.2 s of time. The compensation pressure during injection was 40 hPa. The glass micropipettes (Sterile femtotip I, Eppendorf) used for injection were with 0.5-μm inner and 1-μm outer diameter. As indicated in the respective figure legend, control siRNA and Src siRNA were co-injected with QDot streptavidin conjugate with the emission maximum near 605 nm (Invitrogen). QDot-streptavidin conjugate was used as a fluorescent marker to recognize injection site. After 6 h of injection, the cells were treated with glutamate for 24 h. Calcein AM (Invitrogen) was used for 15 min to stain live cells. Digital images were collected using a specialized phase contrast as well as fluorescent Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope suited for imaging cells growing in routine culture plates The sample stage was maintained at 37 °C, and the sample gas environment was maintained exactly as in the culture incubator (21Khanna S. Roy S. Slivka A. Craft T.K. Chaki S. Rink C. Notestine M.A. DeVries A.C. Parinandi N.L. Sen C.K. Stroke. 2005; 36: 2258-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). siRNA Delivery and Analysis of Genes and Proteins—HT4 cells (0.1 × 106 cells/well in 12-well plate) or primary cortical neurons (1.5–2 × 106 cells/well in 12-well plate) were seeded in antibiotic-free medium 24 h prior to transfection. DharmaFECT™ 1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon RNA Technologies, Lafayette, CO) was used to transfect cells with 100 nm siRNA pool (Dharmacon RNA Technologies) for 72 h as described previously (25Khanna S. Roy S. Parinandi N.L. Maurer M. Sen C.K. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1474-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For controls, siControl nontargeting siRNA pool (mixture of 4 siRNA, designed to have ≥4 mismatches with the corresponding gene) was used. HT4 cells were harvested and seeded for treatment with glutamate as indicated in the respective figure legends. After 12 h of seeding, the culture medium was changed, and the cells were treated as described in the respective figure legends. For quantification of mRNA and protein expression, the samples were collected after 72 h of siRNA transfection. For the primary neurons, the media were changed, and the neurons were treated with glutamate after 72 h of transfection. Total RNA was isolated from cells using the Absolutely RNA® Miniprep kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The abundance of mRNA for c-Src, Csk, and SHP-1 were quantified using real time PCR using SYBR green-I. The following primer sets were used: m_GAPDH F, 5′-ATG ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC ACT-3′; m_GAPDH R, 5′-TGT TGA AGT CGC AGG AGA CAA CCT-3′; m_c-Src F, 5′-TCC ACA CCT CTC CGA AGC AA-3′; m_c-Src R, 5′-CAT GCT GAT GGC CTG TGT CA-3′; m_CSK F, 5′-AAG GGG GAG TTT GGA GAT GTG A-3′; m_CSK R, 5′-AAT CAC ACC CAG CAG CTG GA-3′; m_SHP-1 F, 5′-GGG CAC CAT CAT CGT CAT TGA TAT-3′; m_SHP-1 R, 5′-CAG CGG GAG GGT ACG TGA TAT T-3′; r_GAPDH F, 5′-TAT GAC TCT ACC CAC GGC AAG TTC A-3′; r_GAPDH R, 5′-CAG TGG ATG CAG GGA TGA TGT TCT-3′; r_SHP-1 F, 5′-CAG GGT CAC GCA CAT CAA GGT TAT-3′; and r_SHP-1 R, 5′-CCG AGT GGC ATA GTA AGG CTG C-3′. After protein extraction, the protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein reagents. The samples (20–40 μg of protein/lane) were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with anti-c-Src (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-Csk (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) antibodies. To evaluate the loading efficiency, the membranes were probed with anti-β-actin antibody. Overexpression of Src in SHP-1 Knockdown Cells—Transfection of cells with siRNA was performed as described above. Following siRNA delivery, the cells were transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector containing mouse Src (wild type or constitutively activated) cDNA under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as reported previously (10Sen C.K. Khanna S. Roy S. Packer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The kinase-activating (constitutively activated (CA)) mutation (srcY529F) is a substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine at position 529. The kinase-inactivating mutation (srcK297R) is a substitution of arginine for lysine at position 297 (10Sen C.K. Khanna S. Roy S. Packer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to carry out the transfection. After 24 h of Lipofectamine treatment, the transfection reagent was replaced with regular cell culture medium. The cells were maintained in regular culture condition for 24 h to allow for protein expression. At this point, the cells were harvested and seeded for treatment with glutamate. After 8 h of seeding, the culture medium was changed, and the cells were treated as described in the legend to Fig. 10. SHP-1 Overexpression—Wild type SHP-1 cDNA and SHP-1CS (catalytically inactive SHP-1 variant) in pSVL vector were obtained from Dr. R. Siraganian. Following 18 h of seeding, HT4 cells were transfected with plasmid empty pcDNA3.1, SHP-1, and SHP-1CS using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (20Khanna S.

After 3 h of Lipofectamine treatment, the transfection reagent was replaced with regular cell culture medium. The cells were maintained in regular culture condition for 24 h to allow for protein expression. At this point, the cells were harvested and seeded for treatment glutamate. After 12 h of seeding, the culture medium was changed, and the cells were treated as described in the figure legend. To assess the level of SHP-1 expression, HT4 cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, seeded for 12 h, and collected for analysis of protein expression by Western blot. The protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein reagents. The samples (20 μg of protein/lane) were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and probed with anti-SHP-1 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY). To evaluate the loading efficiency, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots—For immunoprecipitation, HT4 cells (0.5 × 106 cells/well) were seeded in six-well plates. To inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity, the cells were treated with 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) for 10 min. Next, the cells were either treated or not with PP2 or PP3 followed by challenge with glutamate for different time interval under standard culture conditions as indicated in the respective figure legends. During harvest, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and lysed with 0.20 ml of lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Beverly, MA). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit. The cell lysates (500 μg) were incubated with 1 μg of immunoprecipitating antibody for overnight at 4 °C and then incubated at 4 °C with 20 μl of anti-rabbit IgG beads (TrueBlot Ig IP beads; eBioscience). Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed four times with lysis buffer (centrifugation at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min), recovered in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer with 50 mm of fresh dithiothreitol and boiled for 10 min. Next, equal volume of samples was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblot. Src Kinase Activity—Kinase activity was performed using the KineActive Src assay kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Twenty μg of total protein was used per sample to measure enzyme activity. Immunocytochemistry—The cells (0.5 × 106/plate) were seeded in 35-mm plates 24 h before being challenged by glutamate. To inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity, the cells were treated with 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) for 10 min and then activated with glutamate for 30 min. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS thrice and then fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 20 min. Next, the cells were washed thrice with PBS followed by permeabilization using 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min. Next, the cells were washed thrice with PBS and incubated with 10% goat serum (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with phospho-caveolin-1 (1:100, in 10% goat serum) overnight in 4 °C. The cells were washed with PBS thrice and then incubated caveolin-1 (1:100, in 10% goat serum) for 2 h in 4 °C. After incubation with primary antibodies, the cells were washed with PBS thrice and incubated with an Alexa-fluor rabbit (red) for caveolin-1 and Alexa-fluor mouse (green) for phospho-caveolin-1 for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS and incubation with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (1:10,000) for 2 min, the cells were washed with PBS and mounted in gel mount (aqueous mount; Vector Laboratories) for microscopic imaging. Total Membrane Preparation—Cells (2 × 106/plate) were seeded in 100-mm plates for membrane isolations. The cells (five plates/sample) were harvested for total membrane preparation. Total membranes were prepared as described previously (20Khanna S. Roy S. Ryu H. Bahadduri P. Swaan P.W. Ratan R.R. Sen C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43508-43515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were harvested by scraping. The samples were spun at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Buffer (10 ml) containing 20 mm NaHEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium azide, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added to the cell pellet. The samples were homogenized using a motor-driven homogenizer (15 strokes) at 4 °C. The samples were then spun at 760 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and spun at 190,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting total membrane pellet was resuspended in the above-mentioned buffer, and the samples were stored at 80 °C. The protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein reagents (20Khanna S. Roy S. Ryu H. Bahadduri P. Swaan P.W. Ratan R.R. Sen C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43508-43515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—The data are reported as the means ± S.D. of at least three experiments. Difference between two means was tested by Student’s t test. Comparisons between multiple groups were made by analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Our previous claims implicating c-Src activity in glutamate-induced death of HT4 cells was largely based on studies using pharmacological inhibitors (10Sen C.K. Khanna S. Roy S. Packer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibitors are often known to suffer from a lack of specificity. To address the issue more specifically, we adopted the RNA interference approach to knockdown c-Src. The siRNA approach utilized successfully lowered c-Src mRNA and protein expression in HT4 cells (Fig. 1, A–D). To test whether c-Src knockdown influenced the functional state of c-Src enzyme, an activity assay was performed. c-Src knockdown cells showed significantly lower c-Src activity (Fig. 1E). Experiments testing the effect of c-Src knockdown on glutamate-induced loss of cell viability demonstrated that specific down-regulation of c-Src abundance and activity in the cell protected the cells (Fig. 1F). These observations are consistent with our previous findings using pharmacological inhibitors of c-Src establishing that indeed c-Src contributes to glutamate-induced neurodegeneration (10Sen C.K. Khanna S. Roy S. Packer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To expand on this finding, an additional approach for c-Src siRNA delivery was chosen. A single-cell microinjection technique was employed to deliver c-Src siRNA in specific cells grown on a culture plate. Next, all of the cells in the culture were challenged with glutamate. Although glutamate treatment killed all other cells in the plate, c-Src siRNA clearly protected the cells from glutamate-induced neurodegeneration (Fig. 2). Csk is an endogenous inhibitor of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (26Chong Y.P. Mulhern T.D. Cheng H.C. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To test whether the loss of Csk activity may potentiate glutamate-induced neurodegeneration, Csk knockdown was performed utilizing a siRNA approach (Fig. 3, A and B). Transfection of cells with Csk siRNA significantly lowered the expression of Csk mRNA (Fig. 3A) as well as protein (Fig. 3B) expression. In cells with Csk knockdown, the activity of c-Src was significantly increased (Fig. 3C). Under the given culture conditions, >90% of the cells die after 24 h of glutamate treatment (not shown). Cell viability was only minimally influenced after 12 h of glutamate treatment (Fig. 3D). Csk knockdown clearly potentiated glutamate-induced cell death. The loss of cell viability at 12 h after glutamate treatment was significantly higher in Csk knockdown cells compared with cells transfected with corresponding scrambled control siRNA (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that Csk-dependent maintenance of c-Src in the “locked” inactive format protects against glutamate-induced neurodegeneration. Compromised Csk activity sensitized cells to glutamate-induced neurodegeneration. In this context we note that the effect of Csk knockdown on c-Src activity is modest (Fig. 3C) compared with the more extreme effects of Csk siRNA on protection from glutamate-induced death (Fig. 3D). This implies that other Src family kinases might be mediating the effects observed upon Csk knockdown.FIGURE 2Microinjection of siRNA against c-Src to the cytosol of neural cells protected against glutamate-induced loss of cell viability. Control scrambled siRNA (A) or c-Src siRNA (D) was injected into the cytoplasm. After 6–8 h, the cells were challenged with glutamate for 24 h.

https://openalex.org/W2013832237,"CfaE is the minor, tip-localized adhesive subunit of colonization factor antigen I fimbriae (CFA/I) of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and is thought to be essential for the attachment of enterotoxigenic E. coli to the human small intestine early in diarrhea pathogenesis. The crystal structure of an in cis donor strand complemented CfaE was determined, providing the first atomic view of a fimbrial subunit assembled by the alternate chaperone pathway. The in cis donor strand complemented variant of CfaE structure consists of an N-terminal adhesin domain and a C-terminal pilin domain of similar size, each featuring a variable immunoglobulin-like fold. Extensive interactions exist between the two domains and appear to rigidify the molecule. The upper surface of the adhesin domain distal to the pilin domain reveals a depression consisting of conserved residues including Arg181, previously shown to be necessary for erythrocyte adhesion. Mutational analysis revealed a cluster of conserved, positively charged residues that are required for CFA/I-mediated hemagglutination, implicating this as the receptor-binding pocket. Mutations in a few subclass-specific residues that surround the cluster displayed differential effects on the two red cell species used in hemagglutination, suggesting that these residues play a role in host or cell specificity. The C-terminal donor strand derived from the major subunit CfaB is folded as a β-strand and fits into a hydrophobic groove in the pilin domain to complete the immunoglobulin fold. The location of this well ordered donor strand suggests the positioning and orientation of the subjacent major fimbrial subunit CfaB in the native assembly of CFA/I fimbriae."

The mobility of these successful elements requires the protein encoded by open reading frame-1 (ORF1p), which binds single-stranded RNA with high affinity and functions as a nucleic acid chaperone. In this report, we have used limited proteolysis, filter binding, and NMR spectroscopy to characterize the global structure of ORF1p and the three-dimensional structure of a highly conserved RNA binding domain. ORF1p contains three structured regions, a coiled-coil domain, a middle domain of unknown function, and a C-terminal domain (CTD). We show that high affinity RNA binding by ORF1p requires the CTD and residues within an amino acid protease-sensitive segment that joins the CTD to the middle domain. Insights in the mechanism of RNA binding were obtained by determining the solution structure of the CTD, which is shown to adopt a novel fold consisting of a three-stranded β sheet that is packed against three α-helices. An RNA binding surface on the CTD has been localized using chemical shift perturbation experiments and is proximal to residues previously shown to be essential for retrotransposition, RNA binding, and chaperone activity.

Although the vast majority of L1s are truncated at their 5′ termini and defective, ∼80–100 human elements are retrotransposition-competent and continue to be a major force in shaping the genome (6Brouha B.

Mammalian LINE-1 retrotransposons and related elements.in: Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2002Google Scholar). In mammals, L1s are 6–7 kilobases in length and harbor a 5′-untranslated region containing an internal promoter, two nonoverlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2), and a short 3′-untranslated region that ends in a poly(A) tail. Both of the element-encoded proteins are essential for retrotransposition (14Moran J.V. Holmes S.E. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Boeke J.D. Kazazian Jr., H.H.

The protein encoded by ORF1 (ORF1p) binds single-stranded RNA and DNA and has nucleic acid chaperone activity (15Martin S.L. Cruceanu M. Branciforte D. Wai-Lun Li P. Kwok S.C. Hodges R.S. Williams M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by ORF2 (ORF2p) provides endonuclease and reverse transcriptase functions (14Moran J.V. Holmes S.E. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Boeke J.D. Kazazian Jr., H.H.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5899-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The role of ORF2p in retrotransposition is best understood (19Cost G.J. Feng Q. Jacquier A. Boeke J.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5899-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 20Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). It is believed to initiate the target site-primed reverse transcription by introducing a single nick into the target DNA using a conserved endonuclease domain (21Martin S.L. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2006; 2006: 45621Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This enables the 3′ poly(A)-rich tail to anneal to the chromosome and exposes a 3′-hydroxyl on the DNA that serves as a primer for ORF2p-mediated reverse transcription using L1 RNA as the template. A double-stranded DNA copy of L1 is then synthesized and joined to the target site through a poorly understood process that may require DNA repair machinery supplied by the host (22Fujimoto H. Hirukawa Y. Tani H. Matsuura Y. Hashido K. Tsuchida K. Takada N. Kobayashi M. Maekawa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1555-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ORF1p is essential for retrotransposition and has at least two functions (21Martin S.L. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2006; 2006: 45621Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). First, it binds to L1 RNA during the cytoplasmic phase of the replication cycle and may thereby prevent its degradation. Evidence for this comes from immunochemical staining of embryonal carcinoma cells, which has revealed punctate cytoplasmic structures when probed with anti-ORF1p antibodies (23Martin S.L. Branciforte D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These structures presumably contain several ORF1 proteins bound to full-length L1 RNA, since large ribonucleo-protein particles containing both of these molecules can be fractionated from intact F9 (mouse) (24Martin S.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 4804-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and HeLa (human) cells (16Kulpa D.A. Moran J.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3237-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The ribonucleoprotein particle probably protects L1 RNA from degradation by cellular nucleases and via the RNA interference pathway (25Yang N. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It may also facilitate RNA maturation into a retrotransposition-competent structure and/or nuclear import (21Martin S.L. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2006; 2006: 45621Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). ORF1p may also directly participate in the target site-primed reverse transcription reaction by facilitating nucleic acid strand transfers involved in reverse transcription. This is supported by in vitro studies, which have shown that it is a nucleic acid chaperone; the isolated protein accelerates strand annealing, promotes melting of mismatched duplexes, and in displacement assays facilitates strand exchange (17Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the chaperone activity appears to be required for retrotransposition, since single amino acid ORF1p mutants have been identified that disrupt this function and retrotransposition (15Martin S.L. Cruceanu M. Branciforte D. Wai-Lun Li P. Kwok S.C. Hodges R.S. Williams M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) but are otherwise capable of forming ribonucleoprotein particles (16Kulpa D.A. Moran J.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3237-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The structure of ORF1p from the retrotransposition-competent mouse Tf-type L1 element has been characterized in the greatest detail (42.9 kDa, 371 amino acids) (15Martin S.L. Cruceanu M. Branciforte D. Wai-Lun Li P. Kwok S.C. Hodges R.S. Williams M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Sedimentation and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies indicate that it is a dumbbell-shaped homotrimer that is presumably held together by a trimeric coiled-coil (26Martin S.L. Branciforte D. Keller D. Bain D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13815-13820Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Residues at the C-terminal end of ORF1p show the greatest degree of sequence conservation and bind and chaperone nucleic acids (27Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8112-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Martin S.L. Li J. Weisz J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this report, limited proteolysis has been used to identify three distinct domains: the coiled-coil, middle, and C-terminal domains. The latter two domains are connected by an ∼40-amino acid protease-sensitive linker that in combination with the C-terminal domain (CTD) mediates high affinity RNA binding. NMR has been used to determine the solution structure of the CTD and has elucidated a positively charged surface that interacts with RNA. Proteolysis and Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Spa-type ORF1p—Full-length ORF1 protein from the mouse spa-type L1 element was purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described previously (15Martin S.L. Cruceanu M. Branciforte D. Wai-Lun Li P. Kwok S.C. Hodges R.S. Williams M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Partial proteolysis was performed by adding sequencing grade trypsin (Sigma) to 10 μl of protein (∼2 mg/ml) either on ice or at room temperature (buffer: 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, and 0.15 mm EDTA buffer). The reaction was quenched by the addition of either an equal volume of SDS-PAGE loading dye or 2% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples containing loading dye were loaded onto a NuPage 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). After separation, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining buffer and fixed (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Bands were excised, and the resulting gel cuts were washed multiple times with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Trypsin (10 μlofa 20 ng/μl solution) was then added to each of the gel cuts for 4 h at 37 °C. The gel cut was washed multiple times with 50% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The supernatant was collected and dried, using a SpeedVac (Thermo). The dried sample was then re-elevated in 0.1% formic acid. Liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS of peptide mixtures was conducted on an LC Packings nano-LC system with a nanoelectrospray interface (Protana) and quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer (QSTAR XL; Applied Biosystems), as described in detail previously (30Ramachandran P. Boontheung P. Xie Y. Sondej M. Wong D.T. Loo J.A. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Detected ions were then analyzed using the MASCOT data base search engine (Matrix Science) and the Pro ID program (Applied Biosystems) to determine the identity of the peptides. Positive protein identification was based on standard MASCOT criteria for statistical analysis of LC-MS/MS data. For matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS measurements, peptides from samples that were quenched with 2% trifluoroacetic acid were desalted using a C4 ZipTip (Millipore). MALDI-TOF (Voyager DE-STR; Applied Biosystems) was then employed to determine the masses of the proteolysis fragments (fragments 1–8) after co-crystallization with matrix (sinapinic acid). Sample Preparation of Proteins Used in NMR and Proteolysis Studies—Expression plasmids encoding fragments of ORF1p from the Md-A-type L1 element were generated by PCR using L1 Md-A101 as a template (a gift from H. Kazazian; Gen-Bank™ number AY053456). Nucleotide sequences encoding residues 230–357 and 261–347 were cloned into a pET11a expression vector (Novagen) to produce the ORF1C-1/3 and ORF1CTD proteins, respectively. Both expression vectors were sequenced in the forward and reverse direction to confirm their fidelity. The ORF1C-1/3 and ORF1CTD proteins were overexpressed and purified in an identical manner from Rosetta-DE3 cells (Novagen). Four-liter cell cultures were grown at 37 °C, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h when the A600 nm reached ∼0.7. The cells were then harvested at 8,000 r.p.m. (JA-10), resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml lysozyme), and sonicated on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min (JA-20 rotor), and the supernatant was dialyzed into buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 1 m urea) and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow XK-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). Partially pure protein was eluted using a gradient of 1 m NaCl (0–100%) in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT). Pooled protein fractions were then added to a SP-Sepharose Fast Flow XK-50 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a gradient of 1 m NaCl (0–100%) in buffer B. The protein was then concentrated to ∼1 ml and loaded onto a gel filtration column (Sephacryl S-100) equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm phosphate, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm DTT). Eluted protein was then concentrated using a Centricon concentrator (YM-3, Amicon, Inc.) for NMR studies. 15N-Labeled or 15N- and 13C-labeled proteins were produced by growing the cells in minimal media that contained 15NH4Cl or 15NH4Cl and 13C6-labeled glucose, respectively. Protein NMR samples were ∼1 mm in concentration and contained 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm deuterated dithiothreitol, and 7% D2O. Sample Preparation for Chemical Shift Perturbation Studies—The 43-mer RNA fragment (5′-GGG AGG UUG UUA AUG AAA AGG AAU UAU UGA GAA UUA UAG UUA C-3′), 32-mer RNA fragment (5′-GGG AUA CCA UGU UCA GAA GAA CGU GGU AUC UC-3′), and 9-mer RNA fragment (5′-GGA UAG UUA-3′) were prepared as previously described (31Dieckmann T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired using 300 μm RNA-protein complexes with molar ratios of 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1. Soluble complexes were obtained by mixing the components in the presence of 1 m NaCl, followed by dialysis into no salt buffer (50 mm phosphate pH 6.5, 2.5 mm DTT, 7% D2O). The composite of the amide proton (ΔδHN) and nitrogen (ΔδN) chemical shift change was calculated using the equation, Δδtotal = ((ΔδHNWHN)2 + (ΔδN WN)2)½, with WHN = 1 and WN = 0.154 (33Ayed A.

The final values for the different experimental terms in the target function employed for simulated annealing were 200 kcal mol–1 rad–2 for the torsion angle restraints, 30 kcal mol–1 Å–2 for the experimental distance restraints (NOEs and hydrogen bonds), 1 kcal mol–1 Hz–2 for the 3JHNα couplings, and 0.5 kcal mol –1 ppm–2 for the carbon chemical shifts. Hydrogen bond restraints were introduced in the final stages of refinement and were determined through an analysis of the NOE data. The structures were calculated using hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing protocols, followed by an additional simulated annealing step on each of the initial distance geometry-simulated annealing structures (54Nilges M.

A total of 200 structures were calculated, of which 110 had no NOE, dihedral angle, or scalar coupling violations greater than 0.5 Å, 5°, or 2 Hz, respectively. 40 conformers with the lowest energies were chosen to represent the structure of ORF1CTD and have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (accession code 2JRB). Nitrocellulose Filter Binding Assay—The filter binding assay was performed as previously described (27Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8112-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, ORF1p truncation constructs were incubated with a 76-nucleotide 32P-labeled RNA molecule for 30 min on ice in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). The reactions were filtered through nitrocellulose and DE81 and washed with ice-cold binding buffer, and the remaining labeled RNA was quantified by phosphorimaging analysis using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The apparent dissociation constant (KD(app)) was calculated by plotting the total concentration of protein ([Ptotal]) as a function of the fraction of the RNA that was bound (y). Two models were used to fit the data. Noncooperative binding was assumed by fitting the data to the equation, y = ([Ptotal]/KD(app))/(1 + [Ptotal]/KD(app)), where [Pfree] is approximately equal to [Ptotal]. Data were also fit to a cooperative binding model using the equation, y = (ymax)/(1 + ê([Ptotal] – KD(app))/[Ptotal]/ha), where ha is the apparent Hill coefficient. Mouse ORF1p Contains Three Protease-resistant Regions—The structure of full-length ORF1p from the mouse Tf-type spa L1 element was investigated using limited proteolysis followed by MS. Full-length ORF1p containing a 39-amino acid N-terminal histidine tag was partially proteolyzed with trypsin, and the products were separated by gel"

Nevertheless, Thr505 phosphorylation has been implicated as a mechanism that influences PKCδ activity. This study examines the controls of PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes. We implicate phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and PKCδ autophosphorylation in the “priming” maturational PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation that accompanies de novo enzyme synthesis. In contrast, we show that PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation dynamically increases in cardiomyocytes treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or the α1-adrenergic receptor agonist norepinephrine via a mechanism that requires novel PKC isoform activity and not phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. We used a PKCɛ overexpression strategy as an initial approach to discriminate two possible novel PKC mechanisms, namely PKCδ-Thr505 autophosphorylation and PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation in trans by PKCɛ. Our studies show that adenovirus-mediated PKCɛ overexpression leads to an increase in PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation. However, this cannot be attributed to an effect of PKCɛ to function as a direct PKCδ-Thr505 kinase, since the PKCɛ-dependent increase in PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation is accompanied by (and dependent upon) increased PKCδ phosphorylation at Tyr311 and Tyr332. Further studies implicate Src in this mechanism, showing that 1) PKCɛ overexpression increases PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes and Src+ cells but not in SYF cells (that lack Src, Yes, and Fyn and exhibit a defect in PKCδ-Tyr311/Tyr332 phosphorylation), and 2) in vitro PKCδ-Thr505 autophosphorylation is augmented in assays performed with Src (which promotes PKCδ-Tyr311/Tyr332 phosphorylation).

This effectively relieves autoinhibition and enables PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of target substrates. However, we and others recently demonstrated that PKCδ also is dynamically regulated through phosphorylation at a conserved threonine residue in the activation loop (Thr505) (1Rybin V.O. Sabri A.

In contrast, PKCδ is catalytically active even without activation loop phosphorylation. Rather, activation loop phosphorylation plays a distinctive role to regulate the enzymology (activity, substrate specificity) of membrane-associated allosterically activated PKCδ (1Rybin V.O.

The precise controls and consequences of the coordinate events that govern PKCδ phosphorylation and translocation in highly differentiated cells, such as cardiomyocytes, remain uncertain.PKCδ activation loop phosphorylation has been attributed to phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1, a general AGC activation loop kinase) on the basis of studies examining in vitro phosphorylation events on heterologously overexpressed PKCδ in undifferentiated cell types (3Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Our recent studies suggest that this model is not sufficient to describe the control of PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation in the heart, where the α1-adrenergic receptor agonist norepinephrine (NE) and PMA increase PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation via a mechanism that is blocked by GF109203X (a relatively nonselective inhibitor of most PKC isoforms), and not by Go6976 (an inhibitor that preferentially blocks calcium-sensitive PKC isoforms (1Rybin V.O.

These results provided tentative evidence that the dynamic stimulus-dependent increase in PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation is mediated by an nPKC isoform and not PDK-1 (which is a GF109203X-insensitive enzyme). Since this conclusion runs counter to the general consensus that PKC activation loop phosphorylations are via a PDK-1-dependent mechanism, the relative roles of PDK-1 and nPKC isoforms as PKCδ-Thr505 kinases are examined in greater detail in this study.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology with the following exceptions: anti-PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Tyr(P), anti-PKCα, and anti-AKT (Upstate Biotechnology); anti-PKCɛ (BD Transduction); and anti-Src (Oncogene).Cell Culture—Cardiomyocytes were isolated from the hearts of 2-day-old Wistar rats by a trypsin dispersion procedure using a differential attachment procedure to enrich for cardiomyocytes followed by irradiation as detailed in previous publications (6Sabri A. Short J. Guo J. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The yield of cardiomyocytes typically is 2.5-3 × 106 cells/neonatal ventricle. Cells were plated on protamine sulfate-coated culture dishes at a density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. Experiments were performed on cultures grown for 5 days in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and then serum-deprived for the subsequent 24 h. Primary cardiac fibroblast cultures were obtained from the cells adherent to the culture dishes during the preplating step, as described previously (6Sabri A. Short J. Guo J. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).PKCɛ-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines (MEFs) were described previously and generously provided by Dr. Peter Parker (7Ivaska J. Whelan R.D. Watson R. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3608-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). PKCɛ-/- MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml hygromycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.Adenoviral Infections—Cell infections with adenoviral vectors that drive expression of wild-type (WT) or kinase-dead (KD) PKCδ, WT-PKCɛ, KD-PKCɛ, or β-galactosidase (as a control) were according to protocols published previously (8Rybin V.O.

Protein extracts were prepared 44-48 h following infections.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblotting on lysates or immunoprecipitated PKCδ was according to methods described previously or the manufacturer’s instructions (6Sabri A. Short J. Guo J. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In each figure, each panel represents the results from a single gel (exposed for a uniform duration); detection was with enhanced chemiluminescence. All results were replicated in at least four experiments on separate culture preparations.Preparation of Soluble and Particulate Fractions—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then immediately transferred to ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 48 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin A, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 50 mm NaF), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was saved as the soluble fraction, and the particulate fraction was solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.In Vitro Phosphorylation of PKCδ by Src—0.1 μg of recombinant human PKCδ was preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C in the absence or presence of Src kinase (0.66 units) in 160 μl of a reaction buffer containing 43 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.75 mm EDTA, 0.77 mm EGTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 125 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.006% Brij-35, 0.04 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm benzamidine, and [γ-32P]ATP (13 μCi, 83 μm) in the absence or presence of phosphatidylserine/PMA. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.RESULTSPMA Promotes PKCδ-Thr505 Phosphorylation via a Mechanism That Requires nPKC Activity and Not PDK-1—Our initial experiments used a pharmacologic approach to identify the PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation mechanism in NE- and PMA-treated cardiomyocytes. Fig. 1A shows that PKCδ retains a low level of Thr505 phosphorylation in resting cardiomyocytes; PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation increases dynamically in response to treatment with either NE or PMA. These stimulus-induced increases in PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation are blocked by GF109203X (a general PKC isoform inhibitor) but not by Go6976 (which selectively blocks calcium-sensitive PKC isoforms, the PKC effector protein kinase D (PKD), and JAK2 (8Rybin V.O.

Linch D.C. Khwaja A. Br. J. Haematol. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar)). Since some PDK-1-dependent phosphorylation mechanisms require the generation of 3′-phosphoinositides that colocalize PDK-1 with substrates at the plasma membrane, the effect of LY294002 (a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) also was examined. Fig. 1A shows that LY294002 does not block agonist-dependent PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation.These pharmacologic studies implicate a nPKC activity in agonist-dependent PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation. Since they run counter to the prevailing notion that PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation is mediated by PDK-1 (a GF109203X-insensitive enzyme), we performed a more detailed analysis of the relative roles of PDK-1 and PKC isoforms as in vivo PKCδ-Thr505 kinases. These studies took advantage of the distinct inhibitory profiles of GF109203X and UCN-01 (a 7-hydroxystaurosporine derivative that was first identified as a PKC inhibitor and subsequently characterized as an even better inhibitor of PDK-1 (10Seynaeve C.M. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Sausville E.A. Worland P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1207-1214PubMed Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1, B and C). Stimulus-dependent activation loop phosphorylation events on PKCδ (Thr505), AKT (Thr308), and PKD (PKD-Ser744/748) were examined in parallel. AKT activation loop phosphorylation was tracked as a control for PDK-1 inhibition by UCN-01, since AKT is a bona fide PDK-1 target. Similarly, PKD activation loop phosphorylation was included to control for PKC inhibition by GF109203X, since PKD activation loop phosphorylation is mediated by a nPKC (PKCδ or PKCɛ, depending upon the specific stimulus and cell type (11Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar)); PKD phosphorylation via PDK-1-dependent mechanisms has not been reported.Fig. 1B shows that H2O2 increases AKT-Thr308 phosphorylation via a PDK-1-dependent mechanism that is fully abrogated by a very low concentration of UCN-01 (<0.1 μm). PMA does not increase AKT-Thr308 phosphorylation, and H2O2-dependent AKT-Thr308 phosphorylation is not blocked by GF109203X. These results identify distinct inhibitory profiles for UCN-01 and GF109203X and implicate PDK-1 (and effectively exclude PKC isoforms) as the AKT-T308 kinase.Fig. 1C shows that PMA and NE increase PKCδ-Thr505 and PKD-Ser744/748 phosphorylation via a mechanism that is blocked by 1-3 μm GF109203X. Although UCN-01 also inhibits the PMA- and NE-dependent increases in PKCδ-Thr505 and PKD-Ser744/748 phosphorylation, these inhibitory actions of UCN-01 are detected only at high concentrations (>10-fold higher that the UCN-01 concentrations required to abrogate H2O2-dependent AKT-Thr308 phosphorylation). This represents a promiscuous action of high UCN-01 concentrations to inhibit PKC isoforms. Collectively, these results indicate that 1) inhibitor studies with UCN-01 and GF109203X can be used to distinguish PDK-1-dependent AKT-Thr308 phosphorylation (which is blocked by low UCN-01 concentrations but not by GF109203X) from PKC-dependent phosphorylation of PKD-Ser744/748 and PKCδ-Thr505 (which are blocked by GF109203X and only high UCN-01 concentrations), and 2) the dynamic cycling of PKCδ between a fully active (Thr505-phosphorylated) and a less active (unphosphorylated) form in response to PMA or NE is mediated by a GF109203X-sensitive kinase with properties resembling a nPKC isoform. This could involve either a PKCδ-Thr505 autophosphorylation reaction or PKCδ-T505 phosphorylation in trans by PKCɛ.PDK-1 Contributes to Activation Loop Phosphorylation during de Novo PKCδ Synthesis—The evidence that PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation is dynamically controlled through an nPKC-dependent mechanism is at odds with the prevailing model that attributes activation loop phosphorylation (for PKCδ and other AGC kinases) to PDK-1. However, this discrepancy might be reconciled if PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation is controlled through dual mechanisms, with an nPKC activity contributing to the dynamic regulation of PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation in response to receptor activation and PDK-1 functioning to phosphorylate the activation loop site of newly synthesized PKCδ. Therefore, we used an adenovirus-mediated gene transfer strategy to examine activation loop phosphorylation on heterologously overexpressed WT- and KD-PKCδ enzymes. We previously showed that WT-PKCδ is expressed at levels ∼7-8 times higher than endogenous PKCδ under these conditions. Fig. 2 shows that WT-PKCδ and KD-PKCδ are both constitutively Thr505-phosphorylated in resting cardiomyocytes, indicating that PKCδ activity is not absolutely required for activation loop phosphorylation. However, at similar MOIs, KD-PKCδ expression is consistently ∼3-4 times lower than WT-PKCδ expression. Moreover, Thr505 phosphorylation of KD-PKCδ is reduced relative to WT-PKCδ, when protein loading is normalized for differences in protein expression. These results suggest that an autophosphorylation mechanism contributes to Thr505 phosphorylation on newly synthesized PKCδ in cells. This phosphorylation defect presumably limits KD-PKCδ expression, since priming phosphorylations play a role to stabilize the phosphatase-/protease-resistant conformation of the enzyme (12Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2The controls of WT-PKCδ and KD-PKCδ Thr505 phosphorylation. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was used to overexpress WT-PKCδ and KD-PKCδ (each at MOI = 100) in the absence or presence of UCN-01 (0.3 μm). Cell extracts were then subjected to immunoblotting to compare PKCδ protein abundance and PKCδ-Thr505 (T505) phosphorylation. Since WT-PKCδ overexpression was ∼5 times higher than KD-PKCδ expression (at a similar MOI), protein loading was adjusted so that activation loop phosphorylation could be compared on similar amounts of heterologously overexpressed WT and KD enzymes. The figure shows that UCN-01 decreases WT-PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation and completely abrogates KD-PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation; KD-PKCδ-Thr(P)505 immunoreactivity was below the limits of detection in UCN-01-treated cultures, even when protein loading was increased and gel exposure times were prolonged.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2 also shows that UCN-01 treatment (to inhibit PDK-1) results in a modest decrease in WT-PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation; UCN-01 completely abrogates KD-PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation. Collectively, these results indicate that the activation loop site of newly synthesized PKCδ is phosphorylated via a dual mechanism involving both an autophosphorylation reaction and PDK-1-dependent phosphorylation in trans.PKCɛ Overexpression Increases PKCδ-Thr505 Phosphorylation—Our pharmacologic studies implicate an nPKC activity (either PKCδ-Thr505 autophosphorylation or PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation in trans by PKCɛ) in PMA-dependent PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation. We used an adenovirus-mediated gene transfer strategy to overexpress PKCɛ and test the hypothesis that PKCɛ acts as a PKCδ-Thr505 kinase. Fig. 3A shows that WT-PKCɛ overexpression (MOI of 100 pfu/cell) increases PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation. This is not associated with a change in PKCδ protein abundance. It is specific to catalytically active PKCɛ; KD-PKCɛ and WT-PKCα do not increase PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 and data not shown).FIGURE 3Ad-PKCɛ increases PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation without increasing PDK-1 expression, PDK-1 activity, or PKCδ protein abundance in cardiomyocytes. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was used to overexpress WT-PKCɛ, KD-PKCɛ, or β-galactosidase as a control in cardiomyocyte cultures (each at an MOI of 100 pfu/cell). 48 h following infection, cultures were treated for 10 min with vehicle, NE (10 μm) or H2O2 (5 mm) as indicated. Immunoblotting was with the indicated antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” pT, phosphothreonine; pS, phosphoserine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although these results could suggest that PKCɛ overexpression increases PKCδ phosphorylation by acting as a direct PKCδ-Thr505 kinase, other mechanisms are possible and were considered. Fig. 3 shows that Ad-WT-PKCɛ overexpression does not lead to any detectable changes in PDK-1 protein expression, PDK-1-Ser241 (activation loop) phosphorylation (panel A); Ad-wt-PKCɛ overexpression also does not increase PDK-1 activity, measured as basal or agonist-dependent AKT phosphorylation (panel B). These results effectively exclude an indirect effect of PKCɛ overexpression to regulate PKCδ via PDK-1.Our previous studies showed that the PMA-dependent increase in PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation is confined to the pool of enzyme recovered in the particulate fraction. Therefore, we considered an alternative indirect mechanism for nPKC isoform cross-regulation involving an effect of PKCɛ to regulate a lipid-modifying enzyme (such as a phospholipase C or diacyl-glycerol kinase (13Kiss Z. Petrovics G. Olah Z. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Schaap D. van der W.J. van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Bend R.L. Ploegh H.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 289 (Pt 3),: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)), leading to increased DAG levels and the stabilization of PKCδ at membranes. To address this alternative mechanism for PKCɛ-dependent PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation, we compared the subcellular distributions of PKCα and PKCδ in resting and PMA-treated Ad-β-galactosidase and Ad-PKCɛ cultures. Fig. 4 shows that PKCα is recovered largely in the soluble fraction, whereas PKCδ partitions between the soluble and particulate fractions of resting Ad-β-galactosidase and Ad-PKCɛ cultures. These results argue that the effect of PKCɛ overexpression to increase PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation cannot readily be attributed to a gross change in PKCδ targeting to membranes. Rather, Fig. 4 shows that PKCɛ overexpression leads to dysregulated PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation. PKCδ-Thr505 immunoreactivity is confined to the pool of PKCδ that localizes to the particulate fraction following PMA treatment in Ad-β-galactosidase cultures. In contrast, PKCδ-Thr505 immunoreactivity is detected in both the soluble and particulate fractions of resting Ad-PKCɛ cultures. Fig. 4 also shows that PMA treatment for 24 h leads to the complete loss of PKC immunoreactivity in Ad-β-galactosidase cultures, whereas the Thr505-phosphorylated form of PKCδ (and lesser amounts of PKCα) accumulates in the particulate fraction of Ad-PKCɛ cultures under these conditions. These results indicate that Ad-PKCɛ overexpression leads to a defect in PKC down-regulation.FIGURE 4Ad-PKCɛ increases PKCδ-Thr505 (T505) phosphorylation without altering PKCδ (or PKCα) partitioning to membranes; Ad-PKCɛ slows PKCδ down-regulation. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was used to overexpress WT-PKCɛ or β-galactosidase as control (MOI of 100 pfu/cell). Cells were partitioned into soluble and particulate fraction 48 h postinfection following a 20-min challenge with vehicle or 300 nm PMA or a 24-h treatment with 300 nm PMA as indicated.

Therefore, additional mechanisms for nPKC cross-talk were considered. In particular, PKCδ is a well known target for regulated tyrosine phosphorylation.

Other studies identify PKCδ phosphorylation at Tyr332 in cells subjected to oxidative stress (15Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U.

Although PKCδ-Thr505 and tyrosine phosphorylations are generally viewed as independently regulated events (and there was no a priori reason to anticipate that PKCɛ overexpression would lead to PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation), Fig. 5A provides surprising evidence that WT-PKCɛ (but not KD-PKCɛ) markedly increases basal and H2O2-dependent PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation. The PKCɛ-dependent increase in PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation is detected with an anti-phospho-PKCδ-Tyr311 antibody (that can be used directly on cell extracts) as well as with anti-phospho-Tyr and anti-phospho-PKCδ-Tyr332 antibodies (that require immunoprecipitation; the anti-phospho-PKCδ-Tyr332 phosphorylation site-specific antibodies detects too many non-specific bands to be informative in studies on cell extracts).FIGURE 5Ad-PKCɛ increases PKCδ-Tyr311 and -Tyr332 phosphorylation without activating Src in cardiomyocytes. A, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was used to overexpress WT-PKCɛ, KD-PKCɛ, or β-galactosidase as a control (MOI of 100 pfu/cell). 48 h following infection, cultures were treated for 10 min with vehicle or H2O2 (5 mm). Immunoblotting was with the indicated antibodies on cell extracts (top) or following PKCδ immunoprecipitation (IP) (bottom). B, WT-PKCɛ overexpression was in the absence or presence of PP1 (10 μm), with β-galactosidase as control. Immunoblotting was on cell extracts with the indicated antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” pY, phosphotyrosine; T, threonine; pT, phosphothreonine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We previously reported that H2O2 increases PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation via an Src-dependent mechanism in cardiomyocytes (8Rybin V.O.

Fig. 5 shows that the Ad-PKCɛ-dependent increases in PKCδ-Tyr311 and -Tyr332 phosphorylation are not accompanied by a detectable increase in Src protein or Src activity (tracked by an antibody that recognizes Src activation loop phosphorylation, a useful surrogate for Src activity). However, the Ad-PKCɛ-dependent increment in PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation requires Src activity, since PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation is not increased in Ad-PKCɛ cultures treated with PP1 (which inhibits Src activity and PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation). These studies provide novel evidence that PKCδ tyrosine and Thr505 phosphorylation are interdependent events. Our results indicate that PKCɛ overexpression leads to Src-dependent PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation and that PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation facilitates further PKCδ phosphorylation at Thr505 (although these results still do not discriminate a PKCδ autophosphorylation reaction from PKCδ phosphorylation in trans by PKCɛ).Previous studies in genetically engineered mouse models have suggested that PKCɛ exerts an inhibitory control on PKCδ protein expression and/or phosphorylation, which is lost in the PKCɛ-/- mouse (i.e. PKCδ protein and/or phosphorylation is already increased in PKCɛ-/- cells) (16Gray M.O.

However, Fig. 6 shows that Ad-PKCɛ overexpression (at increasing MOIs) leads to a dose-dependent increase in PKCδ-Thr505 and -Tyr311 phosphorylation in PKCɛ-/- MEFs and primary cardiac fibroblast cultures. In these cells (which exhibit robust PKCɛ overexpression, even at relatively low MOIs), PKCδ-Thr505/Tyr311 phosphorylation increases without an associated change in PKCδ abundance at low MOI (20 pfu/cell), whereas PKCδ protein also accumulates as PKCɛ overexpression levels inc"

In this study, we attempted to identify novel Akt substrates by using an antibody that recognized a consensus motif phosphorylated by Akt. PC12 cells that overexpressed constitutively active Akt were used. Using two-dimensional PAGE, we identified protein spots that exhibited increased immunostaining of the antibody. Mass spectrometry revealed several major spots as the neuronal intermediate filament protein, peripherin. Using several peripherin fragments, the phosphorylation site was determined as Ser66 in its head domain in vitro. Furthermore, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that Akt interacted with the head domain of peripherin in HEK 293T cells. An antibody against phosphorylated peripherin was raised, and induction of phosphorylated peripherin was observed not only in Akt-activated cultured cells but also in nerve-injured hypoglossal motor neurons. These results suggest that peripherin is a novel substrate for Akt in vivo and that its phosphorylation may play a role in motor nerve regeneration.

Akt (also known as protein kinase B) is a Ser/Thr kinase that plays essential roles in various cellular processes such as cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (1Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). In the nervous system, Akt is suggested to be involved in neurogenesis (2Sinor A.D. Lillien L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8531-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 3Peng Y. Jiang B.H.

Neuron. 2003; 38: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The most evident role of all may be its neuroprotective action. For instance, several previous papers have demonstrated a strong protective effect of Akt on damaged neurons in vivo (10Namikawa K. Honma M. Abe K. Takeda M. Mansur K. Obata T. Miwa A. Okado H. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2875-2886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Manabe Y. Nagano I. Gazi M.S. Murakami T. Shiote M. Shoji M. Kitagawa H. Setoguchi Y. Abe K.

Of particular interest, Akt was proven to have a crucial role in neuronal survival after peripheral nerve injury (10Namikawa K. Honma M. Abe K. Takeda M. Mansur K. Obata T. Miwa A. Okado H. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2875-2886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the peripheral nervous system, in which most neurons can survive and regenerate after injury, glial cells secrete various trophic factors to promote survival and regeneration of nerve-injured neurons. Astrocytes and microglia, which are located around the neuronal cell bodies, are thought to secrete various factors toward injured neurons (14Polazzi E. Contestabile A. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 13: 221-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 15Liberto C.M. Albrecht P.J. Herx L.M. Yong V.W. Levison S.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 1092-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the distal stump of axons far from neuronal cell bodies, Schwann cells also secrete trophic factors (16Frostick S.P. Yin Q. Kemp G.J. Microsurgery. 1998; 18: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Such factors released from those glial cells include a wide range of growth factors such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, and fibroblast growth factor-2 (17Terenghi G. J. Anat. 1999; 194: 1-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Grothe C. Nikkhah G. Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 2001; 204: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Boyd J.G. Gordon T. Mol.

They are known to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway in injured neurons via their respective receptors (20Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin.

In fact, our previous study showed that Akt activity was markedly induced in motor neurons after nerve injury (10Namikawa K. Honma M. Abe K. Takeda M. Mansur K. Obata T. Miwa A. Okado H. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2875-2886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also revealed that activated Akt accelerated axonal elongation, as well as neuronal survival. It is well established that activated Akt exerts its function by phosphorylating its substrates; however, the substrates that specifically exist in neurons are largely unidentified. Thus, identification of novel neuronal substrates is pivotal to gain further insight into the function of Akt in neuronal regeneration. In this study, we attempted to identify novel Akt substrates in neurons by a proteomic approach, using a unique antibody that recognizes the consensus motif phosphorylated by Akt. Here we demonstrate that peripherin, which is a peripheral nervous system neuron-specific intermediate filament protein, is a novel Akt substrate, and that Ser66 of peripherin is the phosphorylation site. Peripherin phosphorylation is apparently induced in motor neurons after nerve injury, suggesting that the Akt-mediated peripherin phosphorylation may play a role in motor nerve regeneration.

As secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used for Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. All of the inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 0.05 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). PC12 cells were maintained on cell culture dishes coated with collagen in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, and 0.05 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Both cell types were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Adenoviral Vectors—The detailed procedure for constructing recombinant adenoviral vectors was described previously (10Namikawa K. Honma M. Abe K. Takeda M. Mansur K. Obata T. Miwa A. Okado H. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2875-2886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HA-tagged wild type Akt (HA-WT-Akt), constitutively active Akt (HA-CA-Akt), which lacks its pleckstrin homology domain but has a Src myristoylation signal sequence, and dominant negative Akt (T308A/S473A; HA-DN-Akt; kindly provided by Drs. M. Kasuga and W. Ogawa) were subcloned into pAxCALNLw Cre-lox P system-mediated expression cassette (23Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

The adenoviral vectors AxCALNLHA-WT-Akt, AxCALNLHA-CA-Akt, and AxCALNLHA-DN-Akt were then constructed by the COS-terminal protein complex method (26Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). AxCANCre and AxCALNLLacZ were kindly provided by Drs. I. Saito and Y. Kanegae (27Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional PAGE—PC12 cells grown on 10-cm cell culture dishes were infected with AxCALNLLacZ (multiplicity of infection (MOI) 100) or AxCALNLHA-CA-Akt (MOI 100) together with AxCANCre (MOI 30). The cells were collected 48 h after infection, washed once with PBS, and lysed in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris base, 8 m urea, and 2% CHAPS. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C until use. Two-dimensional PAGE was performed according to the previous report with slight modification (28Konishi H. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Glia. 2006; 53: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Immobiline DryStrips (pH 3–10, 7 cm; pH 4.5–5.5, 24 cm; Amersham Biosciences) were rehydrated with rehydration solution containing 60 μg (for 7 cm gel) or 240 μg (for 24 cm gel) of the supernatants, 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% IPG buffer (Amersham Biosciences), 20 mm dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue for 12 h at 20 °C. Isoelectric focusing was then performed using the IPGphor Isoelectric Focusing System (Amersham Biosciences) (500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, and 8000 V for 2–3 h at 20 °C). The strips were equilibrated with a buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 65 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min at room temperature, fixed vertically on top of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel by 1.5% agarose in running buffer, and subjected to 25 mA/gel in a cold room. The gels were analyzed by Western blotting for immunostaining or SYPRO Ruby for protein staining according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). In-gel Digestion—Protein spots were punched out from the gel, trimmed into small pieces, destained in a solution containing 50% acetonitrile and 25 mm NH4HCO3, and dehydrated. The gel pieces were then rehydrated in a solution containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 25 mm NH4HCO3 and subsequently treated with 25 mm NH4HCO3 containing 55 mm iodoacetoamide. Following the dehydration step, gel pieces were rehydrated in trypsin solution containing 10 mg/ml trypsin and 25 mm NH4HCO3 overnight at 37 °C, and finally digested peptides were eluted with 50% acetonitrile containing 5% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass Spectrometry—The eluate containing digested peptides was desalted with ZipTip (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The solution was then mixed with an equal volume of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution dissolved in 30% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and spotted onto a target plate. Mass spectrometry was performed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer Reflex III (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) with reflector mode. Obtained peptide mass fingerprinting data were searched against the NCBI data base using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). Western Blotting—Protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, and blots were prepared on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). For two-dimensional gels, whole 7-cm gels or part of 24-cm gels were prepared on the membrane. The blots were probed with primary and subsequent secondary antibodies and visualized by using the chemiluminescence system (Western Lightning; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). If necessary, the membranes were stripped of antibodies by incubating in stripping buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C and then probed with another antibody. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—To generate GST fusion proteins, partial sequences for 1–60, 51–100, 181–251, and 301–350 amino acids of peripherin were amplified from full-length mouse peripherin cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. F. Landon) and subcloned into pGEX 5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed mutagenesis (Ser66 or Ser79 to Ala) was introduced by PCR primers carrying these mutations. BL21 bacteria transformed with these vectors were stimulated with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 20 °C, harvested by brief centrifugation, and lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were subsequently incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the bound proteins were eluted by adding 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After removal of glutathione by dialysis against PBS, the proteins were checked by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining and stored at -80 °C until use. In Vitro Kinase Assay—2.5 μg of GST fusion proteins were incubated with or without 100 ng of recombinant His-tagged CA-Akt (His-CA-Akt) (Upstate Biotechnology) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, and 30 kBq [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation of the fragments was detected by autoradiography. For Western blot analysis, 1 μg of GST fusion proteins was reacted with 100 ng of His-CA-Akt, and one-tenth of the reaction mixtures was analyzed. Phosphorylation-specific Antibody—A rat monoclonal antibody that specifically recognized phosphorylated peripherin (anti-pPer antibody) was raised in accordance with the previous report (29Kishiro Y. Kagawa M. Naito I. Sado Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1995; 20: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 30Ushijima R. Sakaguchi N. Kano A. Maruyama A. Miyamoto Y. Sekimoto T. Yoneda Y. Ogino K. Tachibana T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 10-week-old female WKY/NCrj rat was immunized with a synthetic peptide containing phosphorylated Ser66 (ARLGpS66FRAPRC). Three weeks after immunization, lymph nodes obtained from the rat were dispersed, and lymphocytes were fused with mouse myeloma Sp2/0-Ag14 cells. The phosphorylation-specific antibody was screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using hybridoma supernatants, and clone 2C2 was selected. Finally, 2C2 hybridoma cells were injected into the abdominal cavity of nude mice, and prepared ascites were used for immunological assays. Detection of Peripherin Phosphorylation in Cultured Cells—HEK 293T cells seeded on 60-mm culture dishes were grown to ∼80% confluence and transfected with pcDNA3-peripherin and pcDNA3-HA-WT-Akt using Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen). After 8 h, the cells were seeded into 12 well culture dishes and cultured for another 24 h. The cells were then serum-starved for 10 h, treated with insulin (Sigma), and subjected to Western blot analysis using the anti-pPer antibody. If necessary, inhibitors were added to the cultured medium 30 min before insulin treatment. As for the phosphorylation of endogenous peripherin, PC12 cells infected with AxCALNLLacZ (MOI 100), AxCALNLHA-WT-Akt (MOI 100), AxCALNLHA-CA-Akt (MOI 100), or AxCALNLHA-DN-Akt (MOI 100) together with AxCANCre (MOI 30) for 48 h were examined. Immunoprecipitation—HEK 293T cells seeded on 6-well culture dishes were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-WT-Akt together with pcDNA3 empty vector or FLAG-tagged head domain of peripherin (FLAG-Per 1–103) subcloned into pcDNA3 using Lipofectamin 2000. After 32 h, the cells were serum-starved for 10 h and treated with 100 nm insulin for 20 min. The cells were then washed in Tris-buffered saline briefly and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm NaF). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the soluble fractions were collected and reacted with anti-FLAG antibody followed by precipitation using protein G-Sepharose 4B (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were rinsed four times with lysis buffer and eluted by adding 2× SDS sample buffer. Immunohistochemistry—Adult male Wistar rats weighing ∼150 g were anesthetized with pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) and positioned supine, and their right hypoglossal nerves were crushed with forceps. The rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer 5 days after surgery. The brains were quickly removed, post-fixed overnight at 4 °C in the fixative, and immersed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 25% sucrose for an additional day. Sections were cut on a cryostat (18 μm in thickness), washed once in PBS, and treated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K for 10 min. After two washes in PBS, the sections were blocked with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum for 1 h and subsequently reacted with primary antibodies (anti-peripherin antibody; 1:1000, anti-pPer antibody; 1:1000) in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum overnight at 4 °C. After three washes in PBS, the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h and finally washed three times in PBS. The sections were visualized by fluorescent microscopy (AX70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Identification of Peripherin as an Akt Substrate in Neurons—To identify novel neuronal substrates for Akt, we utilized the anti-phospho-Akt substrate antibody. Akt preferentially phosphorylates Ser or Thr in the RXRXX(S/T) motif, and the antibody specifically recognizes this motif only when Ser or Thr is phosphorylated. PC12 cells infected with adenovirus expressing LacZ or CA-Akt were subjected to Western blot analysis using this antibody, and proteins exhibiting more intense signal in the CA-Akt-expressing preparation were searched. Our preliminary experiment using ordinary SDS-PAGE demonstrated stacked positive bands where isolation of the individual positive band was impossible (data not shown). We therefore performed two-dimensional PAGE to also separate proteins by their isoelectric points, and the two-dimensional gels were analyzed by Western blotting using the antibody. We initially used a wide pH range gel for the first dimension and found numerous spots were intensely stained in the CA-Akt-expressing preparation; in particular in the region in which the isoelectric point was 5.0–5.5 and molecular mass was ∼60 kDa (Fig. 1A). We therefore focused on this region and separated proteins more precisely by using narrow pH range gels for the first dimension (Fig. 1B). Six spots that exhibited the intense positive immunostaining were identical to the protein spots in the protein-stained gels (spots 1–4, 8, and 9 in Fig. 1C). Judging from their sequential spot patterns, we assumed that spots 1–4 were the same proteins, each of which might have different post-translational modifications. Similarly, the spots 8 and 9 were assumed to be the same protein. As representative samples, spots 1 and 9 were punched out from the gel and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to identify the corresponding proteins. The subsequent data base search revealed that both spots were identical to peripherin. All spots (spots 1–4, 8, and 9) were confirmed as peripherin by Western blot analysis using the anti-peripherin antibody (Fig. 1D). Akt Phosphorylates Ser66 of Peripherin in Vitro—Peripherin, whose expression is mostly restricted to neurons in the peripheral nervous system, is a member of type III intermediate filament proteins (31Coulombe P.A.

First, we aimed to determine the phosphorylation site by Akt in vitro using recombinant proteins. Although no typical consensus sequence for the Akt substrate, RXRXX(S/T), was found in peripherin, five potent sequences existed (Fig. 2A). Because several previous papers indicated that Akt could possibly recognize some similar sequences as its target (details are described under “Discussion”), we examined the possibility that Akt was able to recognize and phosphorylate some similar sequences. Four types of GST fusion proteins that contained one or two potent sequences were generated and reacted with recombinant CA-Akt protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 2B). Autoradiography showed that one fragment containing 51–100 amino acids of peripherin (GST-Per 51–100) was exclusively phosphorylated by CA-Akt among four fragments. Because GST-Per 51–100 contained two potent sequences, SARLGS66 and ALRLPS79, we then introduced site-directed mutagenesis to GST-Per 51–100 to produce unphosphorylated mutants. These proteins were analyzed by an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2C). The S66A mutation entirely prevented Akt phosphorylation, whereas the S79A mutation did not cause any alterations. These results demonstrate that Akt phosphorylates Ser66 of peripherin in vitro. The sequence containing Ser66 is highly conserved among mammalian species (Fig. 2D). Ser66 of Peripherin Is Phosphorylated in Akt-activated Cultured Cells—To evaluate peripherin phosphorylation in vivo, a monoclonal antibody (anti-pPer antibody) was raised against the synthetic peptide ARLGpS66FRAPRC. Specificity of this antibody was tested by Western blot analysis using GST-Per 51–100 in vitro (Fig. 3A). The anti-pPer antibody could detect GST-Per 51–100 only when the fragment was reacted with CA-Akt, and the intense immunoreactivity entirely disappeared when the S66A mutant was used. Using this antibody, peripherin phosphorylation was examined in HEK 293T cells. HEK 293T cells were transfected with WT-Akt and peripherin, because they have no endogenous peripherin, subsequently stimulated with insulin to activate Akt, and peripherin phosphorylation was detected by Western blot analysis. First, HEK 293T cells were treated with increasing doses of insulin, and peripherin phosphorylation was examined (Fig. 3B). Both Akt activation, which was evaluated by the phosphorylation state of Akt (32Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), and peripherin phosphorylation occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Next, we observed changes in peripherin phosphorylation over time after insulin treatment (Fig. 3C). Peripherin was phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner, which paralleled Akt activation. To further demonstrate that Akt kinase activity regulated peripherin phosphorylation, we used several inhibitors to modulate Akt activity. Both Akt activation and peripherin phosphorylation were almost prevented by pretreating cells with LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, which inhibited upstream signaling of Akt). In contrast, peripherin phosphorylation was not prevented by Me2SO (the vehicle for control), U0126 (MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor, which prevented mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling), or rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor, which prevented one of the downstream signaling of Akt). We also examined the phosphorylation of endogenous peripherin in PC12 cells by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3E). Peripherin phosphorylation was hardly detected in PC12 cells infected with adenovirus expressing LacZ, WT-Akt, or DN-Akt. In contrast, peripherin phosphorylation was clearly observed in cells expressing CA-Akt. Although some minor additional bands were observed at different molecular masses in this blotting using PC12 cells, we assumed those bands would be nonspecific because their intensity was not affected by WT-, CA-, or DN-Akt expression. Together with the results obtained by HEK 293T cells, these results demonstrate that Ser66 of peripherin is phosphorylated in an Akt-mediated pathway in cultured cells. Akt Interacts with the Head Domain of Peripherin in Vivo—It is likely that Akt may directly phosphorylate Ser66 of peripherin in vivo. To provide further support for this possibility, we examined whether these two proteins could interact in vivo using a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Full-length peripherin, most of which may form intermediate filament in cells, is almost detergent-insoluble (33Giasson B.I. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1869-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and we assumed that peripherin might not be solubilized in a typical lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation. Therefore, we used a deletion form of peripherin for the immunoprecipitation experiment. Because our preliminary experiment showed that the head domain of peripherin (1–103 amino acids), which contained Ser66, could be solubilized entirely in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (data not shown), we used the head domain instead of full-length peripherin in this assay. HEK 293T cells transfected with FLAG-Per 1–103 and WT-Akt were treated with or without insulin and subjected to immunoprecipitation using the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4). Akt was co-precipitated with FLAG-Per 1–103, indicating that they could interact in vivo.It was of note that this interaction was not dependent on Akt activity because insulin treatment did not enhance the interaction. A similar activity-independent binding has also been reported on several other Akt substrates (34Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Although it is well established that ICRAC is activated by store depletion, ICRAC may only represent one subtype of store-operated channels since the SOC currents with properties distinct from ICRAC have been characterized (7Krause E.

These controversial observations may at least in part be reconciled by the fact that TRPC3 forms heterooligomers with the other members of TRPC subfamily (30Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G.

In the present study, we aimed to determine the role of TRPC3 in mediating the receptor- and store-operated calcium influx in A431 cells. Using calcium imaging and whole cell recordings, we found that suppression of TRPC3 expression with siRNA results in significant reduction in store-operated calcium entry. Because most of the functional studies linking TRP family to receptor-operated and store-operated Ca2+ influx utilized Ca2+ imaging or whole cell current recordings, we further extended our analysis with single channel recordings to obtain more detailed information on functional properties of individual types of channels supporting store-operated Ca2+ influx. We found that suppression of TRPC3 in A431 cells results in selective inhibition of specific subtype of store-operated calcium channels and activation of store-independent channels. Together, these data indicate that TRPC3 is essential for formation of functional SOCs in A431 cells. Cell Culture—Human carcinoma A431 cells (Cell Culture Collection, Institute of Cytology, St. Petersburg, Russia; ATCC CRL-1555) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 80 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2 mm glutamine. The cells were maintained in 37 °C incubator (5% CO2). For patch clamp and Ca2+-imaging experiments, the cells were plated on glass coverslips and maintained in culture for 1-3 days before use. RNAi—We designed three different 19-nucleotide siRNA targeting human TRPC3 homolog (sense strands: I. 5′-GATCCCCATGCCAGGATATGGTAATGTTCAAGAGACATTACCATATCCTGGCATTTTTTGGAAA-3′ (748-766); II. 5′-GATCCCCATGCTAATTATGGTCTGGGTTCAAGAGACCCAGACCATAATTAGCATTTTTTGGAAA-3′ (1313-1331); III. 5′-GATCCCCGGCTTCAGAAGGATATAGATTCAAGAGATCTATATCCTTCTGAAGCCTTTTTGGAAA-3′ (2196-2214). The synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into pUB/Bsd/H1 RNAi vector containing a cassette for blasticidin selection (40Ma R. Rundle D. Jacks J. Koch M. Downs T. Tsiokas L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52763-52772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide inserts were confirmed by sequencing. Transfections—Cells were transfected by Effectin Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) with the appropriate siRNA vectors, and placed into selection medium containing 10 μg/ml blasticidin. After 2 weeks of selection, the individual clones were picked and expanded. The protein expression in individual clones was tested by immunoblotting. The clone with highest TRPC3 suppression level was generated with siRNA type III. It was designated siTRPC3 and used for experiments. For control of anti-TRPC3 antibodies specificity, cells were transient transfected with pcDNA 3.1 vector containing Myc-tagged human TRPC3 cDNA (generously provided by Dr. C. Montell, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). Western Blotting—A431 and siTRPC3 cells were grown on 5-cm dishes under the conditions described above. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2mm EDTA, 0,2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, inhibitor mixture). The protein concentration was measured by BCA kit (Pierce). Total protein extract (50-150 μg) was applied on 8% SDS-PAGE (10 cm × 12 cm gels). The proteins were transferred onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Inc.) and treated with first polyclonal anti-TRPC1 or anti-TRPC3 antibodies (1:200) and anti-TRPC4 or anti-TRPC6 antibodies (1:500) (Alomone Labs), then with secondary anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000) (Sigma) and developed with SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) at a suitable time so as not to saturate the film. Anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:5000) (Sigma) was used to test for equal protein loading. For the control of specificity of anti-TRPC3 antibody the control A431 cells and cells transient transfected with Myc-tagged TRPC3 were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred onto Immobilon P membrane and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibodies (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-TRPC3 antibodies. Western blots were repeated at least three times using different cell lysates. Ca2+ Imaging—Control A431 and A431-siTRPC3 cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2AM in the presence of 0.025% Pluronic for 40 min at room temperature. Loaded cells were illuminated by alternating 340 and 380-nm excitation light at 2 Hz. Emission fluorescence intensity was measured at 510 nm with the InCyt Basic I/P dual wavelength fluorescence imaging system (Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH). The change in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was expressed as the ratio of emission fluorescence intensity at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths (340/380 ratio). Electrophysiology—All electrophysiological experiments were performed with Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments). pClamp6 software (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and off-line data analysis. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22-24 °C). The whole cell recordings were performed with 3-5 MW sylgard-coated, fire-polished glass pipettes. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 145 NMDG aspartate, 10 Cs-EGTA, 10 Cs-HEPES pH 7.3, 1.5 MgCl2, and either 4.5 CaCl2 (pCa 7.0) or 0 CaCl2 (pCa > 9). Extracellular solution contained (in mm) 140 NMDG aspartate, 10 BaCl2, 10 Cs-HEPES, pH 7.3. The currents were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered digitally at 500 Hz. In all experiments, the holding potential was 0 mV. Periodically (once every 5 s) the holding potential was shifted to -100 mV (for 30 ms) and a 170-ms voltage ramp to +70 mV was applied. The traces recorded before current activation were used as templates for leak subtraction. Whole cell currents were normalized to the cell capacitance. The mean value of cell capacitance was 25 ± 4pF(n = 45). The single channel recordings were performed with 8-15 MΩ glass pipettes. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 105 BaCl2, 10 Tris-HCl (pH 7.3). In cell-attached experiments, the bath solution contained 140 mm KCl and 2mm CaCl2 to nullify the resting membrane potential. In store depletion experiments, 1 mm TPEN, or 1 μm thapsigargin were added to the bath solution containing (in mm): 140 KCl, 5 NaCl, 10 K-Hepes, and 2 EGTA (pH 7.4). In inside-out experiments, the intracellular solution contained (in mm): 140 potassium glutamate, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 K-HEPES pH 7.4, 2 K-EGTA, and 1.13 CaCl2 (pCa 7.0), with or without InsP3. The drugs were applied by bath perfusion. The time required for a complete exchange of solution around the patch pipette was less than 1 s. The single channel recordings were digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 100 Hz for analysis and presentation. The amplitudes of single-channel currents were determined from the current traces and all-point amplitude histograms. The channel open probabilities (NPo) were determined by using the following equation: NPo = (I)/i, where (I) is a mean channel current; and i is the unitary current amplitude. The (I) was estimated from the time integrals of the currents above the baseline, and i was determined from the current traces and all-point amplitude histograms. The data were collected from the current traces after channel activity reached steady state. Chemicals—HEPES, EGTA, Tg, NMDG, and TPEN were from Sigma-Aldrich, UTP, and InsP3 were from Calbiochem, Fura-2AM and Pluronic were from Molecular Probes. Suppression of TRPC3 Expression Reduces Store-operated Calcium Influx in A431 Cells—Our biochemical analysis has shown that A431 cells express several isoforms of TRPC protein family, including TRPC3 (Fig. 1A). This data are in agreement with the unpublished observations of Dr. Schilling. 3W. Schilling, personal communication. Additional evidence of TRPC3 expression in A431 was obtained using transient transfection of Myc-tagged human TRPC3 cDNA in these cells (Fig. 1B). To assess the role of TRPC3 in mediating agonistor store-induced currents in A431 cells, we knocked down TRPC3 expression using three different siRNA constructs and tested the protein levels in individual clones by immunoblotting. A clone that showed the highest reduction in TRPC3 expression (siTRPC3) was expanded and used for electrophysiological and imaging analyses (Fig. 2). To determine the role of TRPC3 in mediating agonist-evoked Ca2+ entry, we compared the UTP-induced Ca2+ entry in control A431 cells and the cells expressing TRPC3 siRNA (siTRPC3). Application of 100 μm UTP to Fura-2-loaded cells maintained in Ca2+-free media, resulted in transient elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels due to calcium release from the intracellular InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores (Fig. 3A). Subsequent re-addition of 2 mm extracellular Ca2+ induced the second peak of intracellular Ca2+ with practically equal transients in A431 and siTRPC3 cells.FIGURE 2Analysis of TRPC3 expression in A431 cells stably expressing siRNA targeting TRPC3 homolog. Control A431 cells and A431 cells stably expressing siRNA targeting TRPC3 (siTRPC3), were analyzed by immunoblotting with the antibodies to TRPC3 or α-tubulin (left panel). Various volumes of total protein extracts of A431 (3 μg/μl) and of siTRPC3 (3 μg/μl) were loaded at each lane (top). α-Tubulin control was used to test for protein loading. Positions of molecular mass markers are shown at the left. The amount of TRPC3 shown on the immunoblotting was quantified by densitometry, normalized to the amount of α-tubulin detected in each lane and plotted as percentage of control (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Suppression of TRPC3 selectively decreases the store-operated calcium influx. Cytosolic Ca2+ levels in control A431 (black line) and siTRPC3 cells (gray line) were monitored by ratiometric Fura-2 imaging. The bars on the top indicate the times of application of 2 mm extracellular Ca2+, 100 μmUTP, 1 μm Tg, or 1 mm TPEN. Each trace represents an average of 12-15 experiments. In every individual experiment, a calcium response form ∼100 cells was recorded. A, control and siTRPC3 cells display similar calcium responses mediated by the extracellular application of UTP. The Ca2+ release evoked by application of UTP in Ca2+-free medium is followed by a Ca2+ elevation upon re-addition of Ca2+ to the extracellular medium. B, suppression of TRPC3 expression reduces Ca2+ influx mediated by depletion of intracellular calcium stores with Tg. C, suppression of TRPC3 levels reduces the Ca2+ influx mediated by depletion of intracellular calcium stores with TPEN. Store-depletion was induced by TPEN added to the Ca2+-free bath medium. Subsequent addition of 2 mm extracellular Ca2+ resulted in Ca2+ entry, which was significantly decreased in siTRPC3 cells when compared with A431 cells. D, gadolinium (Gd3+, 10 μm) inhibits Ca2+ influx mediated by depletion of intracellular store in both control A431 and siTRPC3 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether TRPC3 forms or regulates store-operated channels in A431 cells, we compared Ca2+ entry mediated by passive store depletion in control and siTRPC3 cells. In contrast to the agonist-induced responses, thapsigargin (Tg) or TPEN-induced Ca2+ entry was reduced by respectively 40 and 17% in siTRPC3 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Analysis of the areas underneath the transient Ca2+ peaks showed that control and siTRPC3 cells released similar amounts of calcium from the intracellular stores in response to Tg treatment. These results suggest that TRPC3 suppression does not affect calcium storage or calcium release from the intracellular stores. To further assess the role of TRPC3 in mediating calcium influx in response to store depletion, we analyzed the effect of gadolinium (Gd3+, 10 μm). At micromolar concentrations, Gd3+ blocks the calcium entry triggered by store depletion (41Luo D. Broad L.M. Bird G.S.J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2004; 287: 1709-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We found that in the presence of Gd3+, the Tg-induced calcium peaks were reduced by ∼10- and ∼2-fold in control and siTRPC3 cells, respectively (Fig. 3, B and D). Together, these results suggest that suppression of TRPC3 in A431 cells, results in significant reduction of calcium influx mediated by depletion of the intracellular calcium stores. We next employed the whole cell recordings to investigate the effects of suppression of TRPC3 on cation currents induced by agonists and store depletion. In these experiments, we used 10 mm Ba2+ as a charge carrier. Under these conditions, extracellular application of UTP induced the cation currents that reached the maximum at ∼4 min after addition of the agonist (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the calcium imaging experiments, we found that both control and siTRPC3 cells displayed similar UTP-mediated responses (Fig. 4, A and B). Passive store depletion with Tg also induced the cation currents that displayed kinetics of on-set similar to the agonist-induced currents (Fig. 4C). In a few cells (2 out of 15 in control group and 3 out of 13 in siTRPC3 group), we only observed the highly selective ICRAC-like inward calcium currents that were not affected by suppression of TPRC3 (Fig. 4D). We therefore excluded these experiments from the final analysis. In the remaining experiments, the cation currents induced by Tg were reduced on average to 38% in siTRPC3 cells when compared with control (Fig. 4, C and E). Thus, our calcium imaging and whole-cell experiments consistently show that reduction in TRPC3 levels results in selective inhibition of calcium influx mediated by depletion of the intracellular calcium stores. We next used the single channel analysis to explore the effects of TRPC3 suppression on various types of calcium- and cation-selective channels expressed in A431 cells. TRPC3 Does Not Regulate Imin and Imax Cation Channels—We have previously shown that A431 cells express highly selective Imin calcium channels that could be activated by extracellular UTP, intracellular InsP3 and depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (35Kiselyov K.I.

A. 2001; 98: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, see also Fig. 5F). We also found that Imin channels can be directly activated by N-terminal ligand-binding domain of InsP3R (33Gusev K. Glouchankova L. Zubov A. Kaznacheyeva E. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. Mozhayeva G.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To test whether suppression of TRPC3 affects Imin channels in A431 cells, we performed single channel recordings and tested the effects of extracellular application of UTP or TPEN to the cell-attached patches, and intracellular application of InsP3 to the inside-out patches (Fig. 5). We found that similarly to control A431 cells, siTRPC3 cells express Imin channels that can be activated by extracellular agonists (UTP), store depletion and InsP3 (Fig. 5). The biophysical characteristics of single Imin channels monitored in A431 cells with reduced levels of TRPC3 were identical to Imin channels that we previously described in control A431 cells: the single channel conductance measured in the presence of 105 mm extracellular Ba2+ was 1.2 pS (Fig. 5D); the extrapolated reversal potential was higher than +30 mV, indicating high selectivity for Ca2+ and Ba2+ over K+ (Fig. 5D); and the channel mean open time was ∼8.8 ms (Fig. 5E). The occurrence of Imin channels in siTRPC3 cells stimulated with UTP or store-depletion agents was not significantly different form the control A431 cells. However, these channels could rarely be evoked in siTRPC3 cells stimulated with InsP3 (Fig. 5F). The reversal potential of single Imin channels observed in A431 cells (Fig. 5D) is not consistent with the reversal potential of receptoror store-operated currents that we detected in whole cell mode (Fig. 4, B and E). Are there additional less or non-selective receptor- and store-operated channels in A431 cells? How does suppression of TRPC3 affect these channels? Analysis of 87 single channel experiments revealed that in addition to Imin channels, extracellular application of UTP resulted in activation of less-selective channels that displayed a larger unitary conductance (Fig. 6A). These channels could also be activated by passive store depletion with TPEN (Fig. 6B) or Tg (data not shown). The unitary current-voltage relationship of these channels was nonlinear (Fig. 6G) with the slope conductance of 18 pS at the negative holding potentials. The extrapolated reversal potential was +15 mV (Fig."

From these data, it is found that the paratope of 6B4 is mainly formed by five residues: Tyr27D, Lys27E, Asp28, and Glu93 located in light chain CDR1 and -3, respectively, and Tyr100C of the heavy chain CDR3.

However, in some pathological situations, such as stroke or myocardial infarction, shear rate increases, causing platelet activation and thrombus formation, leading to vessel occlusion. This process is dependent on the binding of the platelet glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) 4The abbreviations used are: GPIbα, glycoprotein Ibα; VWF, von Willebrand factor; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; CDR, complementarity determining region; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; WT, wild type. to von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is bound to the collagen matrix exposed to the flowing blood upon vessel damage. The structure of GPIbα consists of a globular N-terminal region, a sialomucin core, an anionic sequence, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. The N-terminal region (residues 1-282) consists of eight leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and contains the binding sites for VWF, α-thrombin, P-selectin, Mac-1, high molecular weight kininogen, and coagulation factors XI and XII (2Andrews R.K.

Under nonliganded conditions, platelets present the flexible loop (residues 230-242) within the N-terminal domain of GPIbα into a β-switch conformation, which changes upon binding of VWF into a β-hairpin conformation, extending the existing VWF antiparallel β-sheet (5Huizinga E.G.

The globular domain is presented well above the plasma membrane by the sialomucin core, which is connected by a flexible hinge domain: the anionic sequence.

HADDOCK divides the interacting residues into two classes: active residues, which play an important role in binding, and passive residues, which may be indirectly involved in the binding. On the mAb (the ligand) side, it is obvious that the CDRs are involved in the binding. Previous experimental evidence indicated that in GPIbα, one major loop (the flexible loop at amino acids 228-242) is involved in the binding (10Cauwenberghs N. Vanhoorelbeke K. Vauterin S. Westra D.F. Romo G. Huizinga E.G. Lopez J.A. Berndt M.C. Harsfalvi J. Deckmyn H. Blood. 2001; 98: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The solvent-accessible residues of the CDRs and the GPIbα flexible loop were defined as passive residues in the docking experiment. The preliminary ZDOCK (12Chen R. Weng Z. Proteins. 2002; 47: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and consequent site-directed mutagenesis had indicated that Y27DA and E93A (Kabat numbering (20Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Reid-Miller M. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 1987; (, 4th Ed., pp. -XLIV, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD): VIIGoogle Scholar)), situated in the light chain CDR1 and -3, respectively, contribute directly to the binding. Therefore, these residues were defined as being active. In the docking experiment, only the variable domains of the mAb were used. Since these were not covalently bonded, distance restraints were used to keep the light and heavy chains together during the simulated annealing phase of the docking. Production and Purification of Monoclonal Antibodies—The mAbs 6B4, 27A10, and 24G10 were developed in mice against purified human GPIbα (9Cauwenberghs N. Meiring M. Vauterin S. van Wyk V. Lamprecht S. Roodt J.P. Novak L. Harsfalvi J. Deckmyn H. Kotze H.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), purified by affinity chromatography with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against PBS. Antibody purity was checked by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Concentrations were evaluated by optical density at 280 nm, and antibodies were kept at -20 °C before use. Construction and Expression of 6B4 WT and Mutants—Recombinant 6B4 WT and mutants were prepared as chimeric human/murine IgG4 as previously described (17Fontayne A. Vanhoorelbeke K. Pareyn I. Van R.I. Meiring M. Lamprecht S. Roodt J. Desmet J. Deckmyn H. Thromb Haemost. 2006; 96: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Construction of 6B4 mutants was performed with the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions using pKaneo-CM30-Lvar and pKaneo-50-dhfr-Hleuvar vectors, coding for the respective chimeric light and heavy chain of 6B4, and the appropriate primer couple (Table 1). After DpnI digestion and bacteria transformation, clones positive for the presence of plasmid DNA were selected, and their purified DNA was sequenced. All 6B4 antibodies were expressed in a transient expression system using human embryonic kidney cell line 293T/17 and Lipofectamine 2000™ as described before (17Fontayne A. Vanhoorelbeke K. Pareyn I. Van R.I. Meiring M. Lamprecht S. Roodt J. Desmet J. Deckmyn H. Thromb Haemost. 2006; 96: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Purification and Characterization of 6B4 WT and Mutants—The different expressed antibodies were purified on a protein A-Sepharose CL-4B column and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Quality control was performed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-human IgG4-Fc-specific Ab, followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled Ab before revelation using ECL™. Antibody concentration was estimated, in comparison with an IgG4 reference, by sandwich ELISA using anti-human IgG4-Fc-specific Ab for capture and an anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase-labeled Ab for detection. mAb concentrations were adjusted to 1 μg/ml and kept at -20 °C before use. Production and Characterization of rGPIbα Mutants—WT and mutant rGPIbα were produced in a transient expression system using 293T/17 cells and Lipofectamine 2000™. After 48 h, rGPIbα secreted in the medium was concentrated using Centriprep-30 and Centricon-100 devices. The concentration of each mutant was determined by a two-step ELISA as described before (21Shimizu A. Matsushita T. Kondo T. Inden Y. Kojima T. Saito H. Hirai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16285-16294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Binding of 6B4 WT and Mutants to Human Platelets—The capacity of WT and mutant 6B4 to bind to platelets was tested in an ELISA system where the antibody was added, in a dilution series of 1:2, into wells precoated with fixed intact human platelets (17Fontayne A. Vanhoorelbeke K. Pareyn I. Van R.I. Meiring M. Lamprecht S. Roodt J. Desmet J. Deckmyn H. Thromb Haemost. 2006; 96: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Revelation was done by incubating with a monoclonal anti-human-IgG4 antibody (1:4000), followed by a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled Ab (1:5000), before the addition of H2O2 and orthophenylenediamine, stop with H2SO4, and optical density determination (490-630 nm) on a microplate reader. Binding of 6B4 WT at saturation was set as 100%. Binding of rGPIbα WT and Mutants to Monoclonal Anti-GPIbα Antibodies—Recombinant GPIbα WT and mutants were tested for their capacity to bind to coated monoclonal 6B4, 27A10, and 24G10 in an ELISA set up as described previously (21Shimizu A. Matsushita T. Kondo T. Inden Y. Kojima T. Saito H. Hirai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16285-16294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The binding capacity of 6B4 and its mutants to GPIbα as well as the binding of GPIbα and its mutants to monoclonal anti GPIbα antibodies were compared by Student’s t test. The differences were considered statistically significant when p was <0.05. First Model Using ZDOCK—The 6B4 paratope was tentatively determined by constructing computer models of the variable regions of 6B4 bound to different crystal structures of GPIbα. In a first approach, a 6B4 computer model (17Fontayne A. Vanhoorelbeke K. Pareyn I. Van R.I. Meiring M. Lamprecht S. Roodt J. Desmet J. Deckmyn H. Thromb Haemost. 2006; 96: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was docked to the ligand-free conformation of GPIbα (1M0Z.pdb) using the ZDOCK program (12Chen R. Weng Z. Proteins. 2002; 47: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The resulting model was characterized by one major binding site in which the mAb binds to the flexible loop of GPIbα. The model suggested that both the light and heavy chain of 6B4 contribute to the binding to GPIbα. Based on this model, seven 6B4 residues were selected for mutation to Ala: four on the light chain (Y27D, K27E, Val92, and Glu93) and three on the heavy chain (Ser56, Asn58, and Ile100). Mutations of Val92 and Ser56 to Ala were included as negative control, since no major effect was expected. Only Y27DA and E93A were found to affect the binding of 6B4 to GPIbα (Fig. 2, A and B). Second Model Using HADDOCK—Since the rigid body docking method ZDOCK only allow the prediction of two interacting residues, we, in a second approach, used the results from the first round as input to construct a new docking model using HADDOCK1.3 that allows for flexible docking in both 6B4 and GPIbα. We used the four available structures of the mAb plus the ligand-free and ligand-bound structures of GPIbα simultaneously in the docking experiment. The docking of 6B4 to the ligand-bound conformation of GPIbα (1SQ0.pdb) did not produce any acceptable model, since hardly any hydrogen bridges between the two proteins were found that furthermore mainly occurred between main chain elements (data not shown). The docking results with the ligand-free GPIbα structure were grouped into clusters, which are defined as an ensemble of at least two conformations displaying a backbone root mean square deviation at the interface smaller than 1.0 Å (14Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar). Of the energetically best models in each of the three clusters thus obtained (Table 2), docking model 21 in cluster 1 was selected, because both Y27D and Glu93 are predicted to bind GPIbα, which is in agreement with our previous experimental data (Fig. 1). Based on this docking model, light chain K27E, Asp28, and Tyr94 and heavy chain Ser97 and Y100C were selected for mutagenesis (Table 1).TABLE 2Results from the HADDOCK docking of the 6B4 model to the resting conformation of GPlbαCluster 1Cluster 2Cluster 3Model numberInterface areaNonbonded energyModel numberInterface areaNonbonded energyModel numberInterface areaNonbonded energyÅ2kcal/molÅ2kcal/molÅ2kcal/mol89771.1−7181859.1−7125972.8−7623851.5−6350814.5−5055872.4−6721917.2−8688813.8−49 Open table in a new tab In this model, Asp28 forms four interactions, two of which are salt bridges, with the side chains of Arg64 and His86 located in the GPIbα LRR2 and LRR3, respectively. To disrupt these interactions, Asp28 was not only mutated to Ala but also to the positively charged Arg (Table 1). Furthermore, also in this model (and in most generated models) K27E is predicted to play an important role in binding, since it forms two ionic interactions with Asp83 and Asp106 of GPIbα (Table 3, lines 3 and 5). In the first round, however, somewhat unexpectedly, mutation of K27E to Ala did not inhibit the binding of 6B4 to GPIbα (Fig. 2A), so also here we made a second mutant in which the negatively charged Asp is introduced instead. All 6B4 mutants, except for Y94A, which only was expressed in very low quantities, were tested for their capacity to bind to immobilized human platelets (Fig. 2A). Of the five new mutants tested, only S97T still bound normally to GPIbα on platelets. Fig. 2B clearly shows that six mutants (Y27DA and E93A from round 1 and K27EE, D28A, D28R, and Y100CA from round 2) at 0.25 and 0.5 μg/ml maximally allowed 25% binding of 6B4 to GPIbα, whereas the other mutants (K27EA, V92A, S56A, N58A, and I100A from round 1 and S97T from round 2) show nearly normal binding. Based on the mutagenesis data, we can conclude that residues Tyr27D, Lys27E, and Asp28 of CDR L1, Glu93 of CDR L3, and Tyr100C of CDR H3 are part of the paratope of 6B4 (Fig. 2C). The three other CDRs do not seem to be involved in the binding.TABLE 3Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between 6B4 and GPIbα in model 21Number6B4GPIbαHydrogen bond energyAmino acidPositionaPositions of the residues in 6B4 are noted in Kabat numbering.AtomAmino acidPositionAtomkcal/mol1Ser67HGGlu14OE1−2.52Asp28OD1Arg64HH22−1.73Lys27EHZ3Asp83OD2−2.14Asp28OD1His86HE2−3.65Lys27EHZ2Asp106OD2−2.26Thr53OLys231HZ1−2.57Tyr27DHHAsp235OD1−2.58Glu93OE1Lys237HZ3−2.5a Positions of the residues in 6B4 are noted in Kabat numbering. Open table in a new tab Epitope Determination on GPIbα—Based on the docking model of 6B4 bound to GPIbα, a number of residues were predicted to be part of the epitope. All residues present at the antigen surface and forming hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions with residues of 6B4 could be putative residues of the epitope (Table 3). Several of these residues are located in the LRR: Arg64, Asp83, His86, and Asp106. Some other residues involved (Lys231, Asp235, and Lys237) are part of the β-switch region, the key element that changes its conformation during ligand binding (5Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). To validate our model, a set of 38 single to triple GPIbα mutants (21Shimizu A. Matsushita T. Kondo T. Inden Y. Kojima T. Saito H. Hirai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16285-16294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) containing 62 charged residues mutated to Ala (Fig. 3) was tested for the binding to wild type 6B4. As an additional control, two other inhibitory anti-GPIbα mAbs were tested, namely 24G10, which competes with 6B4 for the binding to human platelets (10Cauwenberghs N. Vanhoorelbeke K. Vauterin S. Westra D.F. Romo G. Huizinga E.G. Lopez J.A. Berndt M.C. Harsfalvi J. Deckmyn H. Blood. 2001; 98: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and 27A10 (22Cauwenberghs N. Ajzenberg N. Vauterin S. Hoylaerts M.F. Declerck P.J. Baruch D. Deckmyn H. Haemostasis. 2000; 30: 139-148PubMed Google Scholar), which does not compete (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4Epitope of 6B4, 24G10, and 27A10 on GPIbα.

The images of the three-dimensional models with the surface representation were generated with PyMOL (available on the Word Wide Web).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A marked impairment of the binding of mAb 6B4 was seen to GPIbα mutants D83A/H86A (Fig. 4A, lines 3 and 4), D106A (line 5), K149A/E151A/K152A (line 8), K288A/R290A (line 9), and D235A/K237A (lines 6 and 7), which contain all of the predicted residues except for Arg64 (line 2) and Lys231 (line 10), mutation of which did not affect binding. However, since the binding of all three antibodies (and others) 5M. Yamashita and T. Matsushita, unpublished results. to the first four mutants was similarly decreased, it is possible that these induce a conformational change in GPIbα, as previously hypothesized (21Shimizu A. Matsushita T. Kondo T. Inden Y. Kojima T. Saito H. Hirai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16285-16294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and hence might have an indirect effect on the antibody binding. These residues, therefore, are being treated with caution in the description of the epitope, which on the other hand clearly involves Asp235 and Lys237 of the β-switch region (Fig. 4B). Refined Docking Model—All of the results from the mutagenesis experiments on both 6B4 and GPIbα were combined and used for another docking round with HADDOCK1.3, using again the four 6B4 models and the ligand-free and ligand-bound GPIbα conformation. Results were ranked by interface area and energy contribution to the complex formation and visually analyzed. Also, here the only acceptable docking models could be made with the ligand-free GPIbα conformation, of which the best model, number 61 (Fig. 5 and supplemental material), is very close to the previous model 21. In model 61, 6B4 is rotated and translated into the N-terminal direction, resulting in an increased interaction area from 917.2 to 1164.8 Å2. On the GPIbα side, only the β-switch region has a different conformation, leading to a difference in root mean square deviation of 3.4 Å between the mAbs and the β-switch region. The root mean square difference between the two docking models, 21 and 61, is 8.2 Å when we consider the CDRs but only 7.7 Å when we restrain to the residues that are common in the interface. A close comparison of the two docking models reveals that some of the amino acids of 6B4 that were involved in the interaction area of the docking model 21 no longer are (i.e. L27C). On the other hand, new residues are now situated in the contact surface (i.e. Met51 and Phe71). In model 61, CDR L2 with residues Met51, Ser52, Thr53, and Arg54 is now part of the interacting surface from which it was absent in model 21. In both docking models, the light chain has a dominant role in the binding to GPIbα, whereas CDR H1 is not contributing. The interaction of GPIbα in model 61 does not differ from the one in model 21; the N-terminal flanking region, the five first LRRs, and the β-switch region are all involved in the binding to 6B4. We have developed a monoclonal antibody, 6B4, targeting the human GPIbα, which is responsible for the binding of platelets to the exposed collagen in damaged vessels via von Willebrand factor under high shear stresses. After promising results in animal models of arterial thrombosis, we have developed a recombinant and humanized Fab fragment of 6B4. Importantly, at effective antithrombotic doses, 6B4-Fab does not prolong the bleeding time; nor does it induce thrombocytopenia (9Cauwenberghs N. Meiring M. Vauterin S. van Wyk V. Lamprecht S. Roodt J.P. Novak L. Harsfalvi J. Deckmyn H. Kotze H.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Wu D. Meiring M. Kotze H.F. Deckmyn H. Cauwenberghs N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To take full advantage of the in vivo effects of blocking GPIbα, a compound fit for oral administration is a prerequisite for a broad and prophylactic use. As a first step toward that goal, we here identified the paratope of 6B4 that confers the inhibitory properties of the molecule. In this study, we mapped both the paratope and the epitope of 6B4 by combining computer docking models with mutagenesis studies on both 6B4 and GPIbα. Our first ZDOCK-based docking approach using 6B4 and GPIbα in its ligand-free conformation (1M0Z.pdb) identified only light chain residues Y27D and Glu93, of the seven selected residues, to be critical for the binding. This relatively poor result might be due to the fact that ZDOCK is an algorithm developed for rigid body docking. GPIbα, however, is a molecule with several known conformations, and also antibodies rearrange their residue side and/or main chains to improve the affinity for their targets. One way to overcome this problem would be to perform molecular dynamics simulations followed by calculation of relative free binding energies with the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area as, for example, Wu et al. (23Wu Y. Cao Z. Yi H. Jiang D. Mao X. Liu H. Li W. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 105-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) did to resolve the interaction between the scorpion toxin ScyTx and the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel Rsk2. An alternative strategy, which we followed, is using a docking strategy method that allows flexibility in both ligand (6B4) and target (GPIbα), such as HADDOCK1.3. Docking tasks were submitted, including both the ligand-free and ligand-bound conformation of GPIbα in combination with 6B4 models constructed with the Web Antibody Modeling program, next to the model that we previously used to prepare a humanized 6B4-Fab fragment (17Fontayne A. Vanhoorelbeke K. Pareyn I. Van R.I. Meiring M. Lamprecht S. Roodt J. Desmet J. Deckmyn H. Thromb Haemost. 2006; 96: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After ranking the hits and visual inspection, no good candidate models were identified with the ligand-bound conformation of GPIbα. This finding is in total agreement with our previous result, where the binding of 6B4 was some 6-fold lower to the gain of function (G233V and M239V) GPIbα, as compared with the wild type (10Cauwenberghs N. Vanhoorelbeke K. Vauterin S. Westra D.F. Romo G. Huizinga E.G. Lopez J.A. Berndt M.C. Harsfalvi J. Deckmyn H. Blood. 2001; 98: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These gains of function are found in platelet-type von Willebrand disease and enhance the affinity of GPIbα for VWF (6Andrews R.K. Gardiner E.E. Shen Y. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. Int. J Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1170-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Miller J.L. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 75: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the structure of GPIbα carrying either one of these mutations is similar to its conformation in complex with the VWF A1 domain (19Dumas J.J. Kumar R. McDonagh T. Sullivan F. Stahl M.L. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23327-23334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Next, 6B4 residues involved in the binding to ligand-free GPIbα, as deduced from the docking model 21, were expressed as single mutants. The chimeric human/mouse 6B4-IgG4 was chosen because it has the same characteristics (17Fontayne A. Vanhoorelbeke K. Pareyn I. Van R.I. Meiring M. Lamprecht S. Roodt J. Desmet J. Deckmyn H. Thromb Haemost. 2006; 96: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as the parental IgG and is easy to manipulate and to produce. Indeed, production of the mutants in quantities sufficient for the binding studies was possible for all 13 mutants except for Y94A. Binding experiments of 6B4 WT and its mutants were performed on whole fixed platelets of healthy volunteers, thereby presenting GPIbα in the GPIb·IX·V complex. All together we positively identified three paratope residues in CDR L1 and one in CDR L3 and CDR H3 each, which all together are in close spatial proximity on the antibody surface. To further validate docking model 21, we next explored the role of every charged residue in GPIbα by using the Ala scan library previously described (21Shimizu A. Matsushita T. Kondo T. Inden Y. Kojima T. Saito H. Hirai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16285-16294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Mutation of most of the predicted interacting residues caused deficient binding. However, since a number of these mutations are suspected to induce a conformational change in GPIbα (21Shimizu A. Matsushita T. Kondo T. Inden Y. Kojima T. Saito H. Hirai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16285-16294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which also here resulted in a decreased binding of two other anti-GPIbα antibodies with different epitopes (10Cauwenberghs N. Vanhoorelbeke K. Vauterin S. Westra D.F. Romo G. Huizinga E.G. Lopez J.A. Berndt M.C. Harsfalvi J. Deckmyn H. Blood. 2001; 98: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we cannot make a definitive statement on these, in contrast to residues Asp235 and Lys237 located in the β-switch region, which specifically affected binding of 6B4. These results are furthermore in perfect agreement with the study of Cauwenberghs et al. (10Cauwenberghs N. Vanhoorelbeke K. Vauterin S. Westra D.F. Romo G. Huizinga E.G. Lopez J.A. Berndt M.C. Harsfalvi J. Deckmyn H. Blood. 2001; 98: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), where we used human/canine chimeric GPIbα to map the epitope. Finally, we performed a new docking experiment, including all known experimental data, which yielded a final model in total agreement with all of the mutagenesis results. In conclusion, by identifying the crucial residues involved in the paratope-epitope interaction of 6B4 with GPIbα, a detailed model of the complex at the atomic level is proposed. This information allows for a better understanding of the antithrombotic action of 6B4 and will be helpful in the design of improved molecules. Furthermore, and in a broader perspective, the iterative method we used here to identify the interacting amino acid residues by alternating docking and mutagenesis experiments allows for a more rational identification of relevant residues than what a classical laborious mutagenesis scan can provide and can be readily applied to other protein-protein interactions for which sufficient structural information is available.

Light promotes dephosphorylation of phosducin; thus, it was proposed that phosducin plays a role in the light adaptation of G protein-mediated visual signaling. Different functions, such as regulation of protein levels and subcellular localization of heterotrimeric G proteins, transcriptional regulation, and modulation of synaptic transmission have also been proposed. Although the molecular basis of phosducin interaction with G proteins is well understood, the physiological significance of light-dependent phosphorylation of phosducin remains largely hypothetical. In this study we quantitatively analyzed light dependence, time course, and subcellular localization of two principal light-regulated phosphorylation sites of phosducin, serine 54 and 71. To obtain physiologically relevant data, our experimental model exploited free-running mice and rats subjected to controlled illumination. We found that in the dark-adapted rods, phosducin phosphorylated at serine 54 is compartmentalized predominantly in the ellipsoid and outer segment compartments. In contrast, phosducin phosphorylated at serine 71 is present in all cellular compartments. The degree of phosducin phosphorylation in the dark appeared to be less than 40%. Dim light within rod operational range triggers massive reversible dephosphorylation of both sites, whereas saturating light dramatically increases phosphorylation of serine 71 in rod outer segment. These results support the role of phosducin in regulating signaling in the rod outer segment compartment and suggest distinct functions for phosphorylation sites 54 and 71.

We found that in the dark-adapted rods, phosducin phosphorylated at serine 54 is compartmentalized predominantly in the ellipsoid and outer segment compartments. In contrast, phosducin phosphorylated at serine 71 is present in all cellular compartments. The degree of phosducin phosphorylation in the dark appeared to be less than 40%. Dim light within rod operational range triggers massive reversible dephosphorylation of both sites, whereas saturating light dramatically increases phosphorylation of serine 71 in rod outer segment. These results support the role of phosducin in regulating signaling in the rod outer segment compartment and suggest distinct functions for phosphorylation sites 54 and 71. Phosducin (Pdc) 2The abbreviations used are: Pdc, phosducin; Gβγ, the βγ subunits complex of heterotrimeric G protein; Pdc54p and Pdc71p, phospho-specific antibodies recognizing phosducin phosphorylated at residue 54 and 71, respectively; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A. was originally identified in the retina as an abundant 33-kDa cytosolic phosphoprotein phosphorylated in the dark and dephosphorylated in the light (1Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1972-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Within the retina Pdc is expressed in both rod and cone photoreceptors (2Lee R.H. Whelan J.P.

Sci. 1994; 35: 3922-3930PubMed Google Scholar). The most distinguished feature of Pdc is its ability to form a specific complex with the βγ subunits of visual heterotrimeric G protein, transducin (4Lee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Lolley R.N.

Affinity of Pdc toward Gβγ is down-regulated by multiple phosphorylation and probably consequent binding of 14-3-3 protein (9Nakano K. Chen J. Tarr G.E. Yoshida T. Flynn J.M. Bitensky M.W. Proc.

Although the identity of Pdc kinase and phosphatase in photoreceptors remains unknown, the analysis of Pdc phosphorylation in vitro and ex vivo revealed that Pdc possesses multiple cAMP-dependent protein kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation sites (10Thulin C.D.

Zhu X. Lolley R.N. Craft C.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13526-13538Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Despite the obvious progress in understanding the molecular basis of Pdc/Gβγ interactions, the role of Pdc and its light-dependent phosphorylation in photoreceptors is poorly understood. Originally it was proposed that, upon activation by light, Pdc scavenges transducin βγ subunits from phototransduction and by doing so reduces photoreceptor light sensitivity (14Lee R.H. Ting T.D.

The first clues into in vivo Pdc functions were obtained from the analysis of Pdc-null mice (17Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Michaud N.A. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19149-19156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The analysis of long term light adaptation in this mutant revealed that Pdc significantly increases light-driven transducin translocation, another adaptive mechanism regulating the amount of transducin engaged in phototransduction (for a recent review, see Ref. 18Calvert P.D.

It was also noticed that the deletion of Pdc gene reduced the level of transducin β subunit by 30%. To assess the individual contributions of two known light-regulated phosphorylation sites of Pdc, serine 54 and serine 71 (11Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15860-15866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee B.Y. Thulin C.D. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54008-54017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), to the regulation of transducin translocation, we quantitatively analyzed their status and subcellular localization in free-running mice under physiologically relevant levels of illumination. We found that Pdc phosphorylated at serine 54 is present predominantly in the ellipsoid and rod outer segment, whereas phosphorylation of serine 71 occurs throughout the entire rod. We also found that rapid and reversible dephosphorylation of both sites was triggered by a very dim light below the threshold of transducin translocation. Prolong exposure to moderate ambient light initiated light-driven transducin translocation and also caused massive phosphorylation of serine 71 in the rod outer segments. Our results provide evidence for Pdc playing potential roles in both light adaptation and light protection of rod photoreceptors and point to the distinct functions of phosphorylation sites serine 54 and 71. Antibodies—The phospho-specific antibodies against Pdc were generated by 21st Century Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA) as follows. Peptides corresponding to amino acids 50-59 and 67-77 of mouse Pdc containing phosphoserine at positions 54 and 71 (peptide sequences LRQMpSSPQSR (pS, Ser(P)-54) and SRKMpSIQEYEL (Ser(P)-71)) were synthesized and used to immunize rabbits according to the standard procedure. Phospho-specific antibodies against Pdc, designated as Pdc54p and Pdc71p, were affinity-purified from the immune serum using immobilized specific peptides. To eliminate binding to dephosphorylated Pdc, each antibody was depleted against LRQMSSPQSR and SRKMSIQEYEL peptides. Antibody against full-length Pdc was described previously (17Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Michaud N.A. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19149-19156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Antibody against rod transducin α subunit was sc-389 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody against subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase, was MS404 from MitoSciences. Monoclonal 4D2 antibody against rhodopsin was a gift from Dr. Robert S. Molday (University of British Columbia). Light Conditioning of Animals—All experiments involving animals were performed according to the procedures approved by the West Virginia University Animal Care and Use Committee. Wild type pigmented Long Evans rats and 129SV mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Pdc knock-out mice described previously (17Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Michaud N.A. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19149-19156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were back-crossed into 129SV background for three generations. Animals were maintained in standard cage rooms with cyclic light (12 h light/12 h dark) until used. Before all experiments animals were dark-adapted overnight. Light conditioning of mice was performed in a 23 × 15 × 20-cm white box illuminated from a white diffuser embedded into the lid and connected to the light guide of an adjustable light source ACE I (Schott). Light conditioning of rats was carried out in 40 × 50 × 30-cm white box evenly illuminated from the top by the bench light source. The levels of illumination in the box were measured using a Traceable light meter (Fisher) (units, photopic lux) and a calibrated photodiode attached to a PDA-750 amplifier (Terahertz Technologies) (units, microamperes, μA). The light-collecting surface of the photodiode was covered by a blue glass filter (BG 39, Newport Franklin Inc., Franklin, MA) with a spectral sensitivity closely matching that of rhodopsin. The luminance of the walls was calculated assuming the white box to be a cube according to the formula 1 cd/m2 = 2π/3 lux. At the end of the experiment animals were euthanized by flashing the box with CO2 followed by cervical dislocation, and their eyes were harvested and either frozen on the dry ice or dissected to obtain the retinas. The rate of rhodopsin activation in the photoreceptors during light conditioning in the box was determined experimentally. Dark-adapted 129SV mice were anesthetized to reduce rhodopsin regeneration (20Keller C. Grimm C. Wenzel A. Hafezi F. Reme C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 476-480PubMed Google Scholar), and their corneas were protected by applying the methylcellulose ophthalmic lubricant, Murocel (Bausch and Lomb). Mice were exposed to 103 lux (240 scotopic cd/m2) light in the center of the box for various durations of time. After the exposure, mice were sacrificed, and their eyes were harvested and frozen on dry ice. The rhodopsin content of the eyes was determined as described below. We found that during the first 15 min of exposure the bleaching of rhodopsin could be approximated as a linear process with a rate of 0.0072% s-1. Assuming that the rod cell has 7 × 107 molecules of rhodopsin (21Lyubarsky A.L. Daniele L.L. Pugh Jr., E.N. Vision Res. 2004; 44: 3235-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), this rate corresponds to activation of 5 × 104 rhodopsin rod-1 s-1. The rates of rhodopsin activation under all other levels of illumination were calculated from this value. Determination of the Levels of Rhodopsin—A protocol modified from Sokolov et al. (22Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) was used as follows. All procedures were carried out under dim red light. Two retinas were harvested from a dark-adapted mouse and homogenized in 0.6 ml of water containing 2.5% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (O3757, Sigma) and 1.25% cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (292737, Sigma) by short ultrasonic pulses delivered from a Microson ultrasonic cell disruptor equipped with a 3-mm probe (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY). When required, 5 μm microcystine LR (Sigma) and 50 mm sodium EDTA were added to inhibit protein phosphatase and kinase activities in the extracts. The extract was cleared by centrifugation on a Centrifuge 5415 D (Eppendorf) at 16,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was divided into two equal aliquots; one was kept in the dark, and the second one was exposed to bright light for 1 min to bleach all rhodopsin. The absorption 400-700 nm spectrum of the dark aliquot was then obtained in a UV-Mini 1240 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) using the bleached aliquot as a base line. Rhodopsin concentration was determined from a 500-nm peak using a molar extinction coefficient of 40,500 (23Bownds D. Gordon-Walker A. Gaide-Huguenin A.C. Robinson W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). When required, the same protocol was used to determine rhodopsin content of the whole eye. Determination of the Levels of Pdc—The amounts of Pdc in the retinas were determined by quantitative Western blotting with a standard curve according to the protocol modified from Sokolov et al. (17Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Michaud N.A. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19149-19156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as follows. The retinas were harvested from dark-adapted 129SV mice, and the whole retina extracts containing known amounts of rhodopsin were prepared as described above. The extracts were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting together with the standard curve comprised of various amounts of purified recombinant Pdc added to the Pdc-null retinal extracts containing the same amount of rhodopsin as the analyzed samples. Phospho-Pdc standards were generated by in vitro phosphorylation with an excess of either Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II or cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which was previously reported to cause virtually complete phosphorylation of serine 54 and serine 71, respectively (19Lee B.Y. Thulin C.D. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54008-54017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Serine 54-phosphorylated Pdc standard was obtained by incubating 100pmol of recombinant Pdc with 500 units of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (P6060S, New England Biolabs) using buffers, reagents, and protocols provided by the manufacturer. Serine 71-phosphorylated Pdc standard was obtained by incubating 400 pmol of Pdc with 100 units of bovine cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 6.5, containing 2.5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, for 1 h at 30 °C. Blots were probed with the pan- and phospho-specific antibodies against Pdc, and the amounts of total- and phosphorylated Pdc in the mouse retinas were calculated from the standard curves and presented as molar ratios with rhodopsin. Pdc Phosphorylation Assays—The eyes were harvested from dark-adapted and light-conditioned 129SV mice of the same age and frozen on dry ice. An eye was homogenized in 0.2 ml of buffer containing 125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 6 m urea, and 10 mg/ml dithiothreitol by short ultrasonic pulses resulting in complete disintegration of the eye tissue. The extract was cleared by centrifugation. 15-μl aliquots were separated on 18-well 10% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane Immobilon FL (Millipore), and probed with phospho-specific Pdc54p and Pdc71p antibodies. Total Pdc was determined after diluting original extracts 100 times. Fluorescence values of phosphorylated Pdc bands were divided by those of total Pdc bands, and then the amounts of phosphorylated Pdc in the light-adapted samples were normalized to those in the dark-adapted samples on the same gel. The time course data were fit to a first order rate equation, ln[A] = -kt + ln[A0] (exponential rise to maximum, two parameters), where [A] and [A0] are the amounts of phosphorylated Pdc at times t and 0 min, respectively, and k is the first order rate constant using Sigma Plot software. Half-life value (t½) was calculated from the rate constant k by the equation t½ = ln(2)/k. Immunoprecipitation—Two mouse retinas were homogenized into 0.4 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (R0278, Sigma) containing 10 mm sodium EDTA, 5 μm microcystine LR (Sigma), 5 μm okadaic acid (Sigma), and protease inhibitor mixture (#539131, Calbiochem) by several short ultrasonic pulses. Homogenates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Pierce) and 20 μg of Pdc71p antibody for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. Beads were separated from supernatant by centrifugation and washed 3 times with 1.0 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and then bound Pdc was eluted from the beads with 0.1 ml of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and vacuum-dried in a Vacufuge (Eppendorf). The supernatant was mixed with 9 volumes of 10% trichloroacetic acid, 50% acetone and incubated on ice for 30 min. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times with 1.0 ml of cold acetone, and vacuum-dried. Both bound and unbound fractions were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 6 m urea, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, bromphenol blue tracking dye, and 10 mg/ml dithiothreitol for the subsequent Western blot analysis. Serial Tangential Sections of the Retina—Tangential sectioning of the rat retina was carried out as previously described (17Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Michaud N.A. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19149-19156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with several optimizations. Eyes were dissected under a stereo microscope in HEPES-Ringer solution containing 130 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.02 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, osmolarity adjusted to 313 mosm. When necessary all tissue manipulations were conducted in the dark under a Stemi 2000-C stereomicroscope (Zeiss) equipped with OWL Gen 3+ intensifiers (B.E. Meyers and Co. Inc.) and an infrared light source. The anterior portion of the eye was cut away, and the lens was removed. The eye cup with the retina attached to it was cut into four pieces of the same size. Each piece was transferred to the flattening chamber filled with HEPES-Ringer, where the retina was gently pulled away from the eyecup and mounted photoreceptors up onto a supporting polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was positioned on top of a flat glass capillary array (GCA 09/32/25/0/20 LM, BURLE Electro-Optics, Sturbridge, MA). The retina was flattened by first applying a suction force from underneath the filter slowly removing all solution from the flattening chamber and then by clamping the retina on the supporting membrane between two glass slides separated by 0.5-mm spacers. The assembly was frozen on dry ice. To align the retina with the cutting plane of the cryostat blade, optimal cutting temperature compound was allowed to freeze at -20 °C on the specimen holder and then sectioned through to create a flat surface large enough to accommodate the glass slide. The clamps, the cover glass, and the spacers were removed; the base slide with the retina on the supporting membrane attached to it was gently pressed against the optimal cutting temperature compound surface and secured by the addition of water drops to the sides of the glass base. The retina and its supporting membrane were generously trimmed around the perimeter to remove uneven and folded parts and 5-μm-sectioned. When the first sizeable section was cut out, all other parts of the retina not included in this section were trimmed away, and then sectioning was resumed. Each section was collected and thawed in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 6 m urea, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, bromphenol blue tracking dye, and 10 mg/ml dithiothreitol. To assess the quality of the sectioning, 0.5-μl aliquots were applied on dry nitrocellulose membrane, and the dot blots were probed with anti-rhodopsin antibody. Only the sets containing rhodopsin in the upper 4-6 sections were selected and stored at -80 °C until analyzed. 15-μl aliquots were analyzed by Western blotting using a Criterion Cell and Blotter system and 26-well 10% Tris-HCl gels (Bio Rad). Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane Immobilon FL (Millipore) was used. For the detection of rhodopsin the original extracts were diluted 100 times. For the detection of Pdc and transducin subunits, the original extracts were diluted 25 times. The profiles of protein distribution in rods were obtained as previously described (22Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In brief, fluorescence of a specific band in each section was plotted as a percentage of combined fluorescence in all sections. To determine the degree of Pdc phosphorylation in different rod compartments, the fluorescence value of the phosphorylated Pdc band in each section was divided by that of total Pdc. The experiments were repeated five times with dark-adapted animals and four times with light-adapted animals. Western Blotting—Quantification of the specific bands was performed on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocols and using specific primary antibodies and anti-rabbit, anti-sheep, and anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen) or IRDye 800 (LI-COR Biosciences). Properties of Phospho-specific Antibodies Against Pdc—Phospho-specific antibodies against two known light-regulated phosphorylation sites of Pdc, serine 54 and 73 (11Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15860-15866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee B.Y. Thulin C.D. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54008-54017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), were generated and affinity-purified. The antibodies were designated as Pdc54p and Pdc71p according to the mouse Pdc sequence. The ability of the phospho-specific antibodies to discriminate phosphorylated and dephosphorylated Pdc is illustrated in Fig. 1. In this experiment, recombinant rat Pdc was phosphorylated in vitro with either Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Fig. 1, upper blot) or cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Fig. 1, lower blot) to introduce phosphate in position 54 or 71, respectively. This approach was previously validated using mass spectrometry (19Lee B.Y. Thulin C.D. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54008-54017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Non-phosphorylated Pdc was used as a control. As evident from the data in Fig. 1, each antibody recognizes only phosphorylated Pdc and was blocked by the phosphopeptide corresponding to its immunization antigen but not by the other phosphopeptide. Consistent with a previous report (19Lee B.Y. Thulin C.D. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54008-54017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), each Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II or cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro phosphorylates Pdc at multiple sites, resulting in the appearance of several bands on an SDS-PAGE. We utilized phospho-specific Pdc54p and Pdc71p antibodies to detect site-specific Pdc phosphorylation by Western blotting. Phosphorylation of Pdc in the Dark-adapted Rods—It is well documented that in the retinas of dark-adapted animals Pdc undergoes phosphorylation; however, the degree of Pdc phosphorylation is unknown. To obtain this information, which is crucial for the understanding of Pdc function, we determined the amounts of serine 54- and serine 71-phosphorylated Pdc in the retinas of dark-adapted 129SV mice using three different experimental approaches. In the first approach the amounts of phosphorylated Pdc in the retina were determined by quantitative Western blotting with a calibration curve (Fig. 2A). The retinas were harvested under dim red light, and then the SDS extracts of the whole retina containing known amounts of rhodopsin were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To quantify the total amount of Pdc, three different extracts were analyzed together with the calibration curve comprised of various known amounts of recombinant Pdc (Fig. 2A, left panel). To create an identical environment in the extracts and calibration curve, which may potentially affect protein transfer from gel to membrane and exposure to antibody, Pdc standards were premixed with the whole retinal extract of Pdc knock-out mice. We found that on average dark-adapted mouse retina contains 26 ± 0.6 molecules of Pdc per 100 molecules of rhodopsin. This number represents the protein level of Pdc in rods because Pdc expression in the retina is limited to photoreceptors, and cones comprise only 3% of the total photoreceptor pool in the mouse retina (24Carter-Dawson L.D. LaVail M.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 188: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Next we determined the amounts of Pdc phosphorylated at serine 54 and 71. In these assays Pdc standards were phosphorylated in vitro by either Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II at serine 54 or cAMP-dependent protein kinase at serine 71, and specific bands were visualized with phospho-specific Pdc54p and Pdc71p antibodies. On average 1 ± 0.03 molecules of serine 54-phosphorylated Pdc and 9 ± 3 molecules of serine 71-phosphorylated Pdc per 100 molecules of rhodopsin were detected in the extracts, respectively. Thus, 4 ± 0.1 and 35 ± 12% of total Pdc in dark-adapted rods appeared to be phosphorylated at serine 54 and serine 71, respectively. The second approach was to immunoprecipitate all phosphorylated Pdc in the retinal extracts with an excess of immobilized phospho-specific antibody and then to determine the degree of Pdc phosphorylation by comparing the amounts of Pdc in the bound, phosphorylated, and unbound, dephosphorylated fractions. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, after immunoprecipitating almost all serine 71-phosphorylated Pdc in the extract with Pdc71p antibody (upper blot), we found that it composed only 44 ± 4% of the total amount of Pdc in the retina (lower blot). Unfortunately, we could not estimate the amounts of serine 54-phosphorylated Pdc by this approach due to the poor performance of Pdc54p antibodies in the immunoprecipitation assay. The third approach was to determine whether or not additional phosphorylation of Pdc in the dark could be achieved by suppressing the activity of protein phosphatase pharmacologically. We reasoned that this would allow endogenous protein kinase to phosphorylate all available Pdc in the retina, thus providing the estimation of the highest achievable level of Pdc phosphorylation in rods. As shown in Fig. 2C, incubation of freshly obtained dark-adapted mouse retinas with phosphatase inhibitors microcystine LR and okadaic acid resulted in the robust increase of the levels of phosphorylated Pdc, providing yet another e"
