https://openalex.org/W2045881743,"Cancer cells often acquire a constitutively active nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) program to promote survival, proliferation and metastatic potential by mechanisms that remain largely unknown. Extending observations from an immunologic setting, we demonstrate that microRNA-146a and microRNA-146b (miR-146a/b) when expressed in the highly metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 function to negatively regulate NF-κB activity. Lentiviral-mediated expression of miR-146a/b significantly downregulated interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase and TNF receptor-associated factor 6, two key adaptor/scaffold proteins in the IL-1 and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, known to positively regulate NF-κB activity. Impaired NF-κB activity was evident from reduced phosphorylation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, reduced NF-κB DNA-binding activity and suppressed expression of the NF-κB target genes IL-8, IL-6 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Functionally, miR-146a/b-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells showed markedly impaired invasion and migration capacity relative to control cells. These findings implicate miR-146a/b as a negative regulator of constitutive NF-κB activity in a breast cancer setting and suggest that modulating miR-146a/b levels has therapeutic potential to suppress breast cancer metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2166636120,"Loss of 1p36 heterozygosity commonly occurs with MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma tumors, and both are associated with an aggressive phenotype. Database searches identified five microRNAs that map to the commonly deleted region of 1p36 and we hypothesized that the loss of one or more of these microRNAs contributes to the malignant phenotype of MYCN-amplified tumors. By bioinformatic analysis, we identified that three out of the five microRNAs target MYCN and of these miR-34a caused the most significant suppression of cell growth through increased apoptosis and decreased DNA synthesis in neuroblastoma cell lines with MYCN amplification. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that neuroblastoma tumors with 1p36 loss expressed lower level of miR-34a than those with normal copies of 1p36. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MYCN is a direct target of miR-34a. Finally, using a series of mRNA expression profiling experiments, we identified other potential direct targets of miR-34a, and pathway analysis demonstrated that miR-34a suppresses cell-cycle genes and induces several neural-related genes. This study demonstrates one important regulatory role of miR-34a in cell growth and MYCN suppression in neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2025026896,"The Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of type I programmed cell death apoptosis; however, their role in autophagic cell death (AuCD) or type II programmed cell death is still largely unknown. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only protein, apolipoprotein L1 (apoL1), that, when overexpressed and accumulated intracellularly, induces AuCD in cells as characterized by the increasing formation of autophagic vacuoles and activating the translocation of LC3-II from the cytosol to the autophagic vacuoles. Wortmannin and 3-methyladenine, inhibitors of class III phosphatidylinostol 3-kinase and, subsequently, autophagy, blocked apoL1-induced AuCD. In addition, apoL1 failed to induce AuCD in autophagy-deficient ATG5-/- and ATG7-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, suggesting that apoL1-induced cell death is indeed autophagy-dependent. Furthermore, a BH3 domain deletion construct of apoL1 failed to induce AuCD, demonstrating that apoL1 is a bona fide BH3-only pro-death protein. Moreover, we showed that apoL1 is inducible by p53 in p53-induced cell death and is a lipid-binding protein with high affinity for phosphatidic acid (PA) and cardiolipin (CL). Previously, it has been shown that PA directly interacted with mammalian target of rapamycin and positively regulated the ability of mammalian target of rapamycin to activate downstream effectors. In addition, CL has been shown to activate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Sequestering of PA and CL with apoL1 may alter the homeostasis between survival and death leading to AuCD. To our knowledge, this is the first BH3-only protein with lipid binding activity that, when overproduced intracellularly, induces AuCD.

In stressed cells the live-or-die decision is largely determined by interplay between opposing members of the Bcl-2 protein family (1Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 2Adams J.M. Cory S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 3Scorrano L.

Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Each member of the Bcl-2 family contains at least one of four conserved amino acid (aa) sequences, Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains 1–4. Based on their function in PCD, the Bcl-2 family members can be divided into three subgroups as follows: multi-BH domain anti-death, multi-BH domain pro-death, and BH3-only pro-death (1Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 2Adams J.M. Cory S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 3Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The BH3 domain is conserved across all Bcl-2 family members and is the only domain retained by BH3-only proteins, further emphasizing the functional significance of this domain (4Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are two major types of PCD, apoptosis and autophagic cell death (AuCD). Apoptosis (type 1) is characterized by nuclear condensation/DNA fragmentation and cell membrane alteration, without major ultrastructural changes of subcellular organelles. It usually involves the activation of caspases as well as the release of apoptogenic effectors, such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor, from mitochondria that contribute to the acquisition of the apoptotic morphology (5Chipuk J.E. Bouchier-Hayes L. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 6Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

The molecular basis of AuCD (type 2), however, is not as well characterized in mammalian cells, even though many lines of evidence connect autophagy to human disease. Autophagy is generally defined as a lysosome-dependent mechanism of intracellular degradation that is used for the turnover of cytoplasmic constituents. There are three major classifications of autophagy: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (9Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar, 10Mizushima N. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2861-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar, 11Cuervo A.M.

Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a highly conserved eukaryotic catabolic process involving the sequestration of the cargo (i.e. fraction of cytosol or organelles) within double membranes, creating autophagosomes, which then fuse with the endosome and lysosome to create autolysosomes. In the lumen of autolysosomes, lysosomal enzymes operate at low pH to catabolize the autophagic material (12Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar, 13Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 14Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Autophagosomes and autolysosomes, also called autophagic vacuoles (AV), are considered to be de novo subcellular organelles specific to the autophagic process. Autophagy allows cells to eliminate large portions of the cytoplasm and is directly involved to eliminate aberrant protein aggregates, remove damaged/aged organelles, defend against pathogen invasions, and cover an essential role in early neonatal development and differentiation (15Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar, 16Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Upwards of 20 autophagy-related genes (ATG) have been identified, which regulate and/or directly participate in the autophagic pathway, particularly in AV formation (10Mizushima N. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2861-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar, 13Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Cell Struct.

Deficiency of ATGs for example, ATG5 and ATG7, causes loss of AV formation and subsequently lack of autophagic response. These deficiencies correlate with various diseases such as cancer, cardiomyopathy, and neurodegenerative diseases (17Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar, 18Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev.

Neurology. 2003; 61: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, recent evidence suggests that autophagy is, on the one hand, a survival pathway necessary to sustain mammalian viability during periods of starvation, and on the other hand, progressive autophagy can be a means to cell death (7Maiuri M.C. Zalckvar E. Kimchi A. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar, 11Cuervo A.M.

Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar). Significantly, Berry and Baehrecke (23Berry D.L. Baehrecke E.H. Cell. 2007; 131: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) reported that autophagy is involved in physiological cell death during Drosophila development but is controlled by similar mechanisms as those that control autophagy function in cell survival. Furthermore, they provide in vivo evidence that both growth arrest and autophagy are required for physiological AuCD. However, the molecular determinants that dictate the control of autophagy for cell survival or death have not yet been revealed. Aside from their role in apoptosis, the members of the Bcl-2 family also play an important role in autophagy. For example, when treating apoptosis-deficient cells, such as BAX and BAK double knock-out cells, with cytotoxic compounds (for example, etoposide), the primary response of those cells was AuCD, suggesting that homeostatic states of these knock-out Bcl-2 members play pivotal roles in regulating AuCD (24Shimizu S.

Science. 2007; 315: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the anti-death Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can bind and inhibit Beclin1, a mammalian ortholog of yeast ATG6, and subsequently inhibit autophagy (28Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar, 29Pattingre S. Levine B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2885-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Beclin1 has been shown to induce formation of AV and autophagy in mammalian cells (28Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Beclin1 has been found to be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor frequently mutated/deleted in breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers (12Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar, 30Yue Z. Jin S. Yang C. Levine A.J. Heintz N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heterozygous knock-out mice of Beclin1 (Beclin1+/-) are tumor-prone, suggesting that autophagy has a tumor suppression function (30Yue Z. Jin S. Yang C. Levine A.J. Heintz N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15077-15082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). Importantly, structural and functional analyses showed that Beclin1 is a novel BH3-only protein, and this BH3 domain within Beclin1 mediates associations with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (32Oberstein A.

In addition to Beclin1, recent studies showed other BH3-only members that also play regulatory roles in autophagy in physiological context. For example, Bid, a BH3-only protein, showed involvement in regulating both apoptosis and autophagy in breast cancer MCF-7 cells (35Lamparska-Przybysz M. Gajkowska B. Motyl T. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2005; 56: 159-179PubMed Google Scholar). Bad and BNIP3, two other BH3-only proteins, when overexpressed, can induce formation of AV in cancer cells (34Maiuri M.C. Criollo A. Tasdemir E.

Interestingly, Bid, Bad, and BNIP3 are downstream targets of p53, a well characterized tumor suppressor and transactivating factor. It has been shown that p53 plays a critical role in the suppression of tumorigenesis, in part, by the induction of both type I and type II PCD (38Chipuk J.E. Green D.R.

To identify and characterize novel BH3-only proteins in AuCD and discover molecular regulators that dictate autophagy for death or survival, in this study, we utilized in silico data base-mining, functional expression, microscopy strategies, and lipid binding assay to examine a novel BH3-only protein, apolipoprotein L1 (apoL1). Cell Lines, Chemicals, and Culture Media—DLD-1.TA14 (a p53-null, “Tet-Off” inducible colorectal cancer cell line) and Hec50co (a p53-null endometrial cancer cell line) and their corresponding growth medium and condition have been described previously (42Liu Z.

HEK293 and AD293 cell lines were purchased from ATCC and Clontech, respectively. All cell lines except DLD-1 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antimicrobial agents as described previously (44Liu Z. Wan G. Heaphy C. Bisoffi M.

Identification and Sequence Analysis of Novel BH3-only Proteins by Functional Genomics and Biocomputing Approaches—The known BH3 domain consensus sequence and a data base-mining strategy were utilized to probe human genome and proteome data bases for the identification of novel BH3-only proteins as described previously (45Liu Z. Lu H. Jiang Z. Pastuszyn A. Hu C.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar). The annotated human open reading frames of candidate genes were downloaded from the most recent NCBI data base (build 36.2). In addition, candidate proteins were assessed for other putative domains/motifs, utilizing public sequence analysis programs and tools, such as the ExPASy proteomics server and ClustalW, as described previously (45Liu Z. Lu H. Jiang Z. Pastuszyn A. Hu C.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, protein tertiary structure prediction was obtained from HMMSTR/ROSETTA (46Bystroff C. Shao Y. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: S54-S61Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 47Bystroff C. Thorsson V. Baker D. J. Mol.

Cloning of Human ApoL1 cDNA and Generation of Inducible ApoL1 Gene—Human apoL1 was identified as a putative BH3-only protein by in silico data base mining. PCR was used to amplified the 1,194-bp full-length apoL1 cDNA. Subsequently, the sequence-confirmed apoL1 and apoL1 with a C-terminal FLAG tag (apoL1.FLAG) were cloned into pBI-EGFP vector (Clontech). The primers used for amplifying apoL1 were as follows: reverse, 5′-CCGCTCCAGTCACAGTTCTTGGTC-3′ (bp +1,197 to +1,183), and forward, 5′-CGACGCGTATGGAGGGAGCTGCTTTGC-3′ (bp +1 to +19). The reverse primer used for amplifying apoL1.FLAG was 5′-CTAGCTAGCTCACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCAGTTCTTGGTC-3′ (bp +1,197 to +1,183). The resulting plasmids were used to transfect a previously described “Tet-Off” inducible system in DLD-1.TA14 (44Liu Z. Wan G. Heaphy C. Bisoffi M. Griffith J.K. Hu C.A. Mol. Cell.

Stably transfected DLD-1 cells harboring pBI-apoL1 or pBI-apoL1.FLAG, namely DLD-1.apoL1 and DLD-1.apoL1.FLAG, respectively, were selected in noninduction medium (D.20) with 20 ng/ml doxycycline (Dox) as described previously (44Liu Z.

Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar). We assayed inducible expression of apoL1 transcripts by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses. Site-specific Deletion Mutagenesis—To generate the BH3 domain deletion allele of apoL1, that is to delete the 27 bp that encode the 9-amino acid BH3 domain (codons 158–166; base pairs +474 to +498), a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (ExSite, Stratagene) and the deletion-specific primers were used. Primer sequences were as follows: forward, 5′-AAGGTCCACAAAGGCACCACC, and reverse, 5′-(p)CCTTCTTATGTTATCCTACAGC. The deletion construct pBI-apoL1.dBH3 was confirmed by sequencing and was used to construct pAD-apoL1.dBH3 plasmid as described above (44Liu Z. Wan G. Heaphy C. Bisoffi M. Griffith J.K. Hu C.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 297: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). ApoL1 Adenovirus (AD-ApoL1)—Construction, amplification, and assaying for titers of adenoviruses (AD) harboring apoL1 and apoL1.dBH3 alleles, and viral infection of mammalian cells were performed as described previously (44Liu Z. Wan G. Heaphy C. Bisoffi M. Griffith J.K. Hu C.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 297: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A variety of cells were infected with control AD, AD-apoL1, and AD-apoL1.dBH3 with a range of concentrations from 0.01 to 5 multiplicity of infection (or plaque-forming units/cell, which was estimated to be 0.2–100 virus particles/cell) for 3 days. Cell numbers, cell death, and survival were measured over time by counting the attached cells, and by microscopy analysis in cell morphology (roundup) and increase of intracellular vacuole formation. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using a Purescript kit (Gentra Systems). RT was conducted using random hexamers, and PCR was conducted using gene-specific primers and a standard protocol as described (36Fei P. Wang W. Kim S.H. Wang S. Burns T.F. Sax J.K. Buzzai M.

Generation of Anti-peptide Antibodies against Human ApoL1—To raise anti-peptide antisera specifically against human apoL1, a peptide corresponding to the codons 384–398 of apoL1 (ILNNNYKILQADQEL) was used to immunize rabbits (Anaspec). Antibody was affinity-purified by chromatography on peptide (antigen)-linked Sepharose and designated as anti-apoL1. Immunoblot Analysis—Total cellular extracts were isolated and used for immunoblot analysis from indicated cells as described previously (42Liu Z. Lu H. Shi H. Du Y. Yu J. Gu S. Chen X. Liu K.J.

Proteins were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE (20 μg of protein/lane) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then incubated with anti-apoL1, anti-activated caspase-9 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-caspase 8 (Cell Signaling), anti-caspase 3, anti-poly-(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-LC3 (MBL), and anti-β-actin (Oncogene Research Products). Subsequently, blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). Analysis of Dose-dependent, Time Course-dependent Cell Death—Taking advantage of the inducibility of the Tet-Off system, dose-dependent and time course-dependent cell death studies were conducted. Briefly, stably transfected DLD-1.apoL1 or DLD-1.apoL1.FLAG cells were grown in D.20. For induction studies, adherent cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, refed with the induction medium containing gradually decreasing concentrations of Dox (5 ng/ml, D.5; 1 ng/ml, D.1; 0 ng/ml, D.0), and harvested at the indicated time points as described previously (31Qu X.

Assay of Protein Localization by Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with collagen (Roche Applied Science). After induction of apoL1 for various times, cells were rinsed and then fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde solution at room temperature. Coverslips were rinsed twice with HBSS and blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA in TBST for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation overnight at 4 °C in 3% (w/v) BSA containing the anti-LC3 antibody (P0036, MBL), coverslips were rinsed with HBSS four times and incubated in 3% (w/v) BSA in TBST containing Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody (T2767, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, coverslips were rinsed with HBSS, mounted onto slides, and subjected to fluorescent microscope analysis. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Cells on coverslips were fixed in 3% formaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 45 min, washed, and finally fixed for 1 h in 1% osmium tetroxide, 0.5% potassium ferrocyanide in cacodylate buffer. The samples were then washed again, dehydrated with graded alcohol, and embedded in Epon-Araldite resin (Canemco). The resin was cured at 65 °C for 2 days, after which the glass coverslips were removed from the resin blocks and the samples were sectioned. Ultrathin sections were collected on copper grids and examined in an Hitachi H-7500 electron microscope. Images were captured and processed with an AMT XR60 B camera and Image Capture software version 5.42. Effect of 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), Wortmannin, and ATGs on ApoL1-induced Cell Death—To investigate whether apoL1-induced cell death was through autophagy, two different experiments were conducted. First, 3-MA (5 mm) and wortmannin (1 μg/ml), two inhibitors of PI3Ks and autophagy, were added to DLD-1.apoL1 cells 8 h prior to the induction of apoL1. Cell death was monitored by light microscopy analysis 24 h after apoL1 induction. Second, wild type (WT), ATG5-/-, and ATG7-/- MEF cells were infected with AD-apoL1.

Recently, a somatic mutation in AKT1 (E17K) has been detected in breast, colorectal, lung and ovarian cancers. The E17K change results in constitutive AKT1 activation and induces leukaemia in mice. We determined the occurrence of the E17K variant in a panel of 764 tumour samples. These included breast, lung, ovarian, colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas as well as melanomas and glioblastomas. Despite the fact that these tumours are known to bear alterations in genes involved in the PI3K signalling pathway, AKT1E17K was detected only in breast (16/273), colorectal (1/88) and lung (1/155) cancers. Within the neoplasms of breast origin, the AKT1E17K variant was mutually exclusive with respect to the PIK3CAE454KorH1047R alleles and was present only in ductal and lobular histotypes. Our results, showing that AKT1 mutations seem to occur in a tissue-specific fashion have basic and clinical implications. First, the activity of mutated AKT1 in oncogenic PI3K signalling could be strictly dependent on the cell and tissue milieu. Second, therapeutic efforts aimed at selective targeting the AKT1E17K variant could be effective mainly in specific cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W2016438005,"A comprehensive microarray analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) revealed distinct synexpression patterns during intrahepatic metastasis. Recent evidence has demonstrated that synexpression group member genes are likely to be regulated by master control gene(s). Here we investigate the functions and gene regulation of the transcription factor SOX4 in intrahepatic metastatic HCC. SOX4 is important in tumor metastasis as RNAi knockdown reduces tumor cell migration, invasion, in vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis. A multifaceted approach integrating gene profiling, binding site computation and empirical verification by chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene ablation refined the consensus SOX4 binding motif and identified 32 binding loci in 31 genes with high confidence. RNAi knockdown of two SOX4 target genes, neuropilin 1 and semaphorin 3C, drastically reduced cell migration activity in HCC cell lines suggesting that SOX4 exerts some of its action via regulation of these two downstream targets. The discovery of 31 previously unidentified targets expands our knowledge of how SOX4 modulates HCC progression and implies a range of novel SOX4 functions. This integrated approach sets a paradigm whereby a subset of member genes from a synexpression group can be regulated by one master control gene and this is exemplified by SOX4 and advanced HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2041822723,"An early event of cell migration is characterized as the rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Recently, we have demonstrated that rapamycin inhibits tumor cell motility. To understand the underlying mechanism, this study was set to determine whether rapamycin inhibition of cell motility is related to its prevention of F-actin reorganization. We found that rapamycin prevented type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I)-stimulated F-actin reorganization in human rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30), Ewing sarcoma (Rh1), glioblastoma (U-373) and prostate carcinoma (PC-3) cells, and concurrently inhibited phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin and p130Cas in the cells. The effect of rapamycin was blocked by expression of a rapamycin-resistant mutant of mTOR (mTORrr), but not a kinase-dead mTORrr. Downregulation of raptor mimicked the effect of rapamycin. Cells infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing constitutively active and rapamycin-resistant mutant of p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) conferred to resistance to rapamycin. Further, IGF-I failed to stimulate F-actin reorganization and phosphorylation of the focal adhesion proteins in the S6K1-downregulated cells. Expression of constitutively hypophosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1-5A) inhibited IGF-I-stimulated F-actin reorganization, but did not alter the cellular protein or phosphorylation levels of the focal adhesion proteins. The results suggest that rapamycin inhibits IGF-I-induced F-actin reorganization and phosphorylation of the focal adhesion proteins by disruption of mTOR–raptor complex. Both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 pathways, mediated by the mTOR–raptor complex, are involved in the regulation of IGF-I-stimulated F-actin reorganization, but only the former controls IGF-I-stimulated phosphorylation of the focal adhesion proteins."

DKK1 is also implicated in osteoporosis, arthritis, and cancer and represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of these diseases. DKK1 is a high affinity antagonistic ligand for LRP6, which is a Wnt coreceptor that acts together with the Frizzled serpentine receptor to initiate Wnt signal transduction. Two different models have been proposed to account for the mechanism by which DKK1 antagonizes LRP6 function. One model suggests that DKK1 binding to LRP6 disrupts Wnt-induced Frizzled-LRP6 complex formation, whereas the other model proposes that DKK1 interaction with LRP6 promotes LRP6 internalization and degradation, thereby reducing the cell surface LRP6 level. To clarify the molecular basis of DKK1 action, we examined how DKK1 affects the endogenous LRP6 in several mammalian cell lines including mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Here we show that DKK1 inhibits Wnt signaling but induces neither LRP6 down-regulation from the cell surface nor reduction of total LRP6 protein level and that DKK1 has no effect on the rate of continuous internalization of LRP6 and the half-life (about 4.7 h) of LRP6.

Wnt3a CM and control CM were collected from L cells stably transfected with a Wnt3a-expressing plasmid (ATCC catalog no. CRL-2647) or untransfected L cells as described by Willert et al. (30Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates J.R. II I Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). All CMs were cleared from cell debris via centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 × g, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. Precipitation, immunoblotting, and the cytosolic β-catenin assay were performed as described earlier (18Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr.

Antibodies—LRP6 antibodies were raised against the entire intracellular domain of human LRP6 and were affinity-purified against the same LRP6 fragment. EGFR antibodies (Cell Signaling, antibody no. 2232), β-catenin antibodies (Sigma, antibody no. C2206), and avidin-HRP conjugate (Pierce, catalog no. 31001) were used according to manufacturers' instructions. LRP6/pcDNA3.1 plasmid was described earlier (31Brown S.D. Twells R.C. Hey P.J. Cox R.D. Levy E.R. Soderman A.R. Metzker M.L. Caskey C.T. Todd J.A. Hess J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). EGF was obtained from Peprotech (catalog no. 315-09). Cell Surface Protein Labeling with Biotin—Cell surface protein labeling with biotin was performed in the cold room at +4 °C using 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce, catalog no. 21335) or cleavable Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce, catalog no. 21331) (32Semenov M.V. He X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38276-38284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To remove cleavable biotin from cell surface proteins, cells were treated with glutathione solution at alkali pH (33Graeve L. Drickamer K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Cell membrane proteins were extracted by 2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h on a rocking platform. Cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation and diluted four times with phosphate-buffered saline, and biotinylated proteins were precipitated with immobilized NeutrAvidin protein (Pierce, catalog no. 29200) or with LRP6 antibodies using GammaBind Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, catalog no. 17-0886-01). Measuring LRP6 Half-life—To measure LRP6 half-life, L cells were seeded on 10-cm dishes. On the second day, cell surface proteins were biotinylated, and cells were returned to the CO2 incubator and allowed to recover from the biotinylation procedure for 2 h. Following the recovery period, cells were incubated with DKK1 or control CMs for various time points as indicated, and culture dishes with cells were removed from the incubator, rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and placed in a -80 °C freezer. Membrane proteins were extracted from all dishes at once, and biotinylated proteins were precipitated with immobilized NeutrAvidin protein. The precipitates were immunoblotted with avidin-HRP to detect changes in bulk biotinylation of cell surface proteins or with LRP6 antibodies to trace the LRP6 turnover. Immunoblotting images were acquired using LSA-3000 system (FujiFilm) and analyzed using NIH Image software. We used four different cell lines (HEK293T (human), Rat2 (rat), mouse L cells, and MEFs) to study the effect of DKK1 on the endogenous LRP6 protein. These cell lines have been commonly used in studies of Wnt signaling. Wnt3a CM robustly activated Wnt signaling in these cells as assayed by cytosolic β-catenin stabilization (Fig. 1A), and DKK1 CM efficiently blocked Wnt signaling in these cells (Fig. 1A), showing that all cellular components required for the inhibition of Wnt signaling by DKK1 are present in each of these cells. We used rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Abs) to examine the endogenous LRP6 protein. These Abs recognized two bands of molecular mass of 200 and 210 kDa on immunoblotting of the cell extract of HEK293T cells that overexpressed LRP6 and also detected the same sized bands of much lower levels in the cell extract from control-transfected HEK293T cells, which presumably represent the endogenous LRP6 in these cells (Fig. 1B). Importantly, these Abs detected two bands of the same sizes in the extract of the wild-type MEFs, but not of LRP6-/- MEFs (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrated that the Abs specifically recognize the endogenous LRP6 protein. We first studied whether DKK1 affects the total LRP6 protein level. L cells were treated with DKK1 for different lengths of time, and cell extracts from control and DKK1-treated cells were analyzed with the LRP6 Abs. We found that the amount of the endogenous LRP6 showed no appreciable changes upon DKK1 treatment, regardless of the length of the treatment (from 15 min to 12 h (Fig. 1D, panel a). And as expected, we observed no changes in the cytosolic β-catenin levels following DKK1 treatment (Fig. 1D, panel b). We next studied whether DKK1 affects the amount of LRP6 on the cell surface. Cells were treated with DKK1 CM for different lengths of time. After DKK1 treatment, cell surface proteins were biotinylated, extracted and precipitated with avidin-agarose beads, and immunoblotted for LRP6 protein. We found that DKK1 treatment for up to 4 h did not affect the amount of LRP6 on the cell surface in L, Rat2, and MEF cells at any time point (Fig. 2A). Similarly, DKK1 treatment had no effect on the cell surface and total LRP6 level in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2B). To confirm that the technique we employed was adequate to detect ligand-induced cell surface receptor down-regulation, we treated Rat2 cells with EGF for 15 min and found that such treatment caused a dramatic reduction of the EGFR amount on the cell surface (Fig. 2C) as previously demonstrated (35Carpenter G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). We further examined whether DKK1 has any effect on the rate of LRP6 internalization. We labeled surface proteins of L cells with a reversible biotinylating agent, Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin, and treated these labeled cells with DKK1 for different lengths of time to allow internalization of cell surface proteins including LRP6. After the treatment, biotin was removed from all proteins remaining on the cell surface (33Graeve L. Drickamer K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). During DKK1 treatment, internalized cell surface proteins, including LRP6, become protected from the biotin removal procedure. These proteins were extracted and precipitated with avidin-agarose beads and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). We found that in control cells, a small portion of LRP6 remained biotinylated after biotin removal from proteins on the cell surface, showing that LRP6 is continuously internalized even in the absence of DKK1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). Importantly, the amount of internalized LRP6 did not change in the presence of DKK1 regardless of the length of the DKK1 treatment, showing that DKK1 did not affect the internalization rate of the endogenous LRP6 (Fig. 3A). At the same time, in the control experiment, we found that EGF treatment of Rat2 cells for 15 min resulted in the internalization of a significant portion of the endogenous EGFR (Fig. 3B). To study the effect of DKK1 on the turnover rate of LRP6 on the plasma membrane, we biotinylated cell surface proteins of L cells (i.e. pulse) and incubated these cells for different lengths of time with control or DKK1 CM (i.e. chase). Biotinylated proteins were extracted, precipitated with avidin-agarose beads, and immunoblotted with the LRP6 Abs. In these “pulse-chase” experiments, we found that the extent and dynamics of LRP6 turnover were similar in cells treated with control or DKK1 CM (Fig. 4, A and B), with the half-life of LRP6 ∼4.7 ± 0.7 h in both cases. We did not observe any significant changes in the biotinylation levels of major cell surface proteins even after 8 h (Fig. 4A, panel c), showing that the half-life of LRP6 is significantly shorter than these major cell surface proteins. To exclude the possibility that biotinylation altered LRP6 properties, we determined the extent of LRP6 biotinylation in our experiments and whether biotinylation of cell surface proteins affects signaling by Wnt3a and inhibition by DKK1. We found that the majority of LRP6 molecules on the cell surface became biotinylated in our experiments (Fig. 5A). We also found that Wnt3a induced the same elevation of cytosolic β-catenin at different time points in control cells and cells subjected to biotinylation (Fig. 5B, panel a). In addition, biotinylation did not affect Wnt3a induction of LRP6 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B, panel c), which reflects LRP6 activation (36Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Addition of DKK1 to Wnt3a CM caused complete inhibition of β-catenin accumulation and LRP6 phosphorylation in both control and biotinylated cells, showing that biotinylation had no adversary effect on DKK1 inhibitory activity (Fig. 5B, lanes 5 and 10). Thus biotinylation did not cause changes in signaling properties of LRP6 on the cell surface. We also examined whether DKK1 pretreatment would reduce cell responsiveness to Wnt3a, a predicted outcome if DKK1 induces LRP6 removal from the cell surface and its degradation. We pretreated Rat2 cells with DKK1 CM for different amounts of time (Fig. 4C, lanes 3–6) and then stimulated these cells with Wnt3a CM (lanes 2–6). We found that Wnt3a-induced β-catenin stabilization was not affected by prior DKK1 treatment ranging from 15 min to 2 h (Fig. 4C). We also found that the same DKK1 pretreatment did not enhance or sensitize Wnt inhibition by a subsequent addition of DKK1 at different doses (Fig. 4D). To ensure that DKK1 CM maintained its Wnt inhibitory activity during the 2-h pretreatment period, we treated Rat2 cells for 2 h with DKK1 CM and then removed the DKK1 CM, mixed it with Wnt3a CM, and applied it to naive Rat2 cells (Fig. 4E). We found that incubation of DKK1 for 2 h with cells did not affect DKK1 ability to block Wnt3a activity when compared with the fresh DKK1 CM (Fig. 4E). Together these results demonstrate that DKK1 treatment does not reduce Wnt responsiveness and are consistent with the notion that DKK1 relies on direct competition to antagonize Wnt3a via binding to LRP6 but not on LRP6 removal from the cell surface. DKK1 is a prototypic Wnt signaling inhibitor that binds to and antagonizes the function of LRP6 (18Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 23Bafico A. Liu G. Yaniv A. Gazit A. Aaronson S.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 24Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). DKK1 is critical for vertebrate development and is implicated in several human diseases including cancer and osteoporosis (1Niehrs C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7469-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) and is of significant therapeutic interests. But how DKK1 antagonizes LRP6 function has not yet been fully resolved. One popular view that has been widely cited in the literature is that DKK1 induces LRP6 internalization from the cell surface and subsequent LRP6 degradation, thereby rendering cells less or nonresponsive to Wnt signaling (28Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide several lines of evidence demonstrating that DKK1 inhibition of Wnt signaling is independent of LRP6 internalization and degradation. Using rabbit polyclonal Abs that specifically recognize the endogenous LRP6 (Fig. 1), we examined the effect of DKK1 on LRP6 in several mammalian cell lines including HEK293T, Rat2, L, and MEF cells. Each of these cell types is responsive to Wnt activation and to DKK1 inhibition and is commonly used in Wnt signaling studies. Contrary to the prevailing view, we found that DKK1 affects none of the following: (i) the total LRP6 protein level (Fig. 1); (ii) the amount of LRP6 on the cell surface (Fig. 2); (iii) the rate of LRP6 internalization, which appears to be constitutive (Fig. 3); or (iv) the half-life of LRP6 on the cell surface (Fig. 4). Furthermore, we found that prior treatment with DKK1 has no effect on the Wnt responsiveness of the cell, further implying that the cell surface LRP6 level is not significantly reduced by DKK1 (Fig. 4). The model that DKK1 down-regulates the LRP6 cell surface level was derived from a study of a putative DKK1 receptor, Kremen2 (Krm2), which is a transmembrane protein (28Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). DKK1 treatment of HEK293T cells that overexpressed both LRP6 and Krm2 induced the removal of overexpressed LRP6 from the cell surface and a significant decrease of the total overexpressed LRP6 amount (28Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). These results led to the suggestion that DKK1 might trigger LRP6 internalization from the cell surface via the formation of a ternary complex involving DKK1, LRP6, and Krm2 and subsequent LRP6 degradation (28Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). However, the role of Krm2 in DKK1-induced LRP6 “internalization” has been rather obscure, as a Krm2 mutant, which lacks the intracellular and the transmembrane domains but is tethered to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, is functionally indistinguishable from the wild-type Krm2 (28Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the Krm2 intracellular domain is dispensable for LRP6 internalization. Recently, the same group (37Hassler C. Cruciat C.M. Huang Y.L. Kuriyama S. Mayor R. Niehrs C. Development (Camb.). 2007; 134: 4255-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed that Krm2 binds to LRP6 directly in the absence of DKK1 and promotes LRP6 cell surface localization and LRP6 signaling. Therefore, the role of Krm2 in the regulation of LRP6 cell surface expression appears to be complex and requires further clarification. Regardless of whether or how Krm2 regulates LRP6 in the absence or presence of DKK1, our study of the endogenous LRP6 protein provides compelling evidence that DKK1 antagonizes LRP6 function via a mechanism that is independent of LRP6 internalization and degradation. In fact, our data are fully compatible with the view that DKK1 competes directly with Wnt proteins for LRP6 binding, thereby disrupting Wnt-induced Fz-LRP6 complex formation as previously demonstrated (18Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). We further note that, as various models have been proposed on the regulation of LRP6 endocytosis and signaling kinetics using LRP6 overexpression, our results highlight potential critical differences between the behavior of overexpressed versus the endogenous LRP6 and underscore the importance of studying the endogenous LRP6, such as by this and other studies (21Zeng X.

https://openalex.org/W2130607734,"Amyloid fibers are filamentous proteinaceous structures commonly associated with mammalian neurodegenerative diseases. Nucleation is the rate-limiting step of amyloid propagation, and its nature remains poorly understood. Escherichia coli assembles functional amyloid fibers called curli on the cell surface using an evolved biogenesis machine. In vivo, amyloidogenesis of the major curli subunit protein, CsgA, is dependent on the minor curli subunit protein, CsgB. Here, we directly demonstrated that CsgB(+) cells efficiently nucleated purified soluble CsgA into amyloid fibers on the cell surface. CsgA contains five imperfect repeating units that fulfill specific roles in directing amyloid formation. Deletion analysis revealed that the N- and C-terminal most repeating units were required for in vivo amyloid formation. We found that CsgA nucleation specificity is encoded by the N- and C-terminal most repeating units using a blend of genetic, biochemical, and electron microscopic analyses. In addition, we found that the C-terminal most repeat was most aggregation-prone and dramatically contributed to CsgA polymerization in vitro. This work defines the elegant molecular signatures of bacterial amyloid nucleation and polymerization, thereby revealing how nature directs amyloid formation to occur at the correct time and location."

https://openalex.org/W1964686769,"Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is important for the normal growth and maintenance of the murine lens. SPARC-null animals develop cataracts associated with a derangement of the lens capsule basement membrane and alterations in lens fiber morphology. Cellular stress and disregulation of apoptotic pathways within lens epithelial cells (LEC) are linked to cataract formation. To identify molecular targets of SPARC that are linked to this disorder, we stressed wild-type (WT) and SPARC-null LEC by serum deprivation or exposure to tunicamycin. SPARC enhanced signaling by integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a serine/threonine kinase known to enhance cell survival in vitro. In response to stress, an ILK-dependent decrease in apoptosis was observed in WT relative to SPARCg-null LEC. Co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking of cell lysates revealed enhanced levels of a SPARC-integrin beta1 complex during stress. Competition with monoclonal antibodies and peptides indicated that the copper binding domain of SPARC is required for SPARC-mediated response to stress. Inhibiting the binding and/or activity of ILK, integrin beta1, or SPARC resulted in increased apoptosis of stressed LEC. We conclude that SPARC protects cells from stress-induced apoptosis in vitro via an interaction with integrin beta1 heterodimers that enhances ILK activation and pro-survival activity."

Muscle development and regeneration rely on the fusion of singly nucleated myoblasts to initiate the formation or augment the growth of multinucleated myotubes. Myoblast fusion involves multiple steps including cell recognition, adhesion, and membrane coalescence. Genetic analyses of Drosophila mutants that fail to form normal muscles during development have been instrumental in elucidating not only the critical steps of myoblast fusion but also proteins that mediate recognition, adhesion, and the cytoskeletal elements that mediate fusion (1Chen E.H. Olson E.N. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 452-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells additional proteins that regulate myoblast fusion have been characterized, as well as many proteins implicated in myoblast differentiation (2Horsley V. Pavlath G.K.

In both vertebrate and invertebrate systems, ultrastructural analysis of fusing myoblasts reveal the presence of vesicles accumulating at the sites of membrane fusion (5Doberstein S.K. Fetter R.D.

Because vesicle fusion is a common feature of most cells, it is possible that aspects of the myoblast fusion machinery utilize pathways more commonly used by other cell types for intracellular trafficking. Based on their involvement in vesicular fusion, the ferlin proteins are candidates for mediating the membrane coalescence stage of myoblast fusion. In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations in the gene encoding the prototypical ferlin protein, fer-1, produce defective membrane fusions in developing spermatozoa that lead to fertility defects (7Achanzar W.E. Ward S. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Washington N.L. Ward S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Myoferlin is a member of the ferlin family and shares homology with fer-1; both proteins each contain multiple C2 domains in the long cytoplasmic portion followed by a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain. C2 domains consist of ∼130 amino acids that adopt conformation independent of neighboring sequences. Crystallographic studies of C2 domains support a structure with multiple aligned β strands and a calcium binding motif formed at one end from the intervening loops (9Benes C.H. Wu N. Elia A.E.

Most C2 domain-containing proteins have one or two domains where one may participate in binding phospholipids, whereas the second may participate in protein-protein interactions. The C2 domains in myoferlin are highly related to those in the synaptotagmins; synaptotagmins participate in the rapid exocytosis that occurs at nerve terminals. Synaptotagmins have two C2 domains, one of which binds phospholipids in response to calcium (12Tang J. Maximov A. Shin O.H. Dai H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2006; 126: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Models for synaptotagmin function suggest that its C2 domains can insert directly within a lipid bilayer and participate in the fusion of two independent membranes (13Hui E. Bai J. Chapman E.R. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1767-1777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Myoferlin and members of the ferlin family are unique because of their multi-C2 domain nature. The myoferlin amino-terminal C2 domain, C2A, directly binds negatively charged phospholipids in response to calcium (14Davis D.B. Doherty K.R. Delmonte A.J. McNally E.M. J. Biol.

In the elongated “prefusion” myoblast, myoferlin is found within vesicular structures in the cytoplasm and concentrated near the plasma membrane.

To understand better the components that direct myoblast fusion, we evaluated myoferlin interacting proteins in myoblasts undergoing fusion. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified EHD2 as a myoferlin-associated protein. Myoferlin contains the amino acid sequence asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF), a known EHD binding motif, within its second C2 domain, and it is this region of myoferlin that binds directly to EHD2. EHD2 protein expression was significantly reduced in myoferlin null myoblasts. Moreover, myoferlin null myoblasts display delayed endocytic recycling accompanied by intracellular aggregation of labeled transferrin. Expression of mutant EHD2 protein in myoblasts leads to sequestration of myoferlin and an inhibition of myoblast fusion. This work demonstrates that impaired endocytic recycling is associated with defective myoblast fusion. Culture of C2C12 Cells and Primary Myoblasts—C2C12 cells were obtained from ATCC (catalog #CRL-1772). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin in 7% CO2. Primary myoblasts were isolated from neonatal wild type and myoferlin null pups and grown and maintained as described (15Doherty K.R. Cave A. Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J. Posey A. Earley J.U. Hadhazy M. McNally E.M. Development. 2005; 132: 5565-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). All tissue culture media and sera used were from Invitrogen. Immunoprecipitation—C2C12 cells or primary myoblasts were grown to confluency (5 days) in growth media. Cells were lysed in coimmunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15% CHAPS with Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science). Cellular debris was removed, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay. Two hundred μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was blocked for 1 h with 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in coimmunoprecipitation buffer, preincubated for 30 min with anti-myoferlin antibody, MYOF3 (15Doherty K.R.

Development. 2005; 132: 5565-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), then incubated overnight with 200 μg of protein. Beads were washed 4 times in coimmunoprecipitation buffer and boiled 10 min in loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), and the supernatant was loaded on a 4–20% acrylamide gel. Gels were either silver-stained (Bio-Rad Silver Stain Plus) or stained with Coomassie or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Identification of Interacting Proteins—The band of interest was excised from a Coomassie-stained acrylamide gel. Five bands of the same molecular weight were combined and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry at the Proteomics Core Facility at University of Chicago. Using the Mascot search engine, full-length murine proteins corresponding to the peptides generated by the mass spectrometry were identified in the non-repetitive NCBI data base, and statistical significance of the matches was determined. Immunoblotting—Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, stained with Ponceau as a loading control, and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-myoferlin (MYOF3, 1:2000) (15Doherty K.R.

Secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, and donkey anti-goat conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at a dilution of 1:5000. Blocking and antibody incubations were done in 5% milk in 1× Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for all antibodies except anti-EHD2 and donkey anti-goat conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. These were incubated in 1× Tris-buffered saline containing 4% donkey serum and 0.1% Tween 20. ECL-Plus chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak Biomax MS film or a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager was used for detection. In Vitro Binding Experiments—Human myoferlin C2 domains were ligated into pGEX4T-1 as previously described (14Davis D.B. Doherty K.R. Delmonte A.J. McNally E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22883-22888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mutant versions of myoferlin C2B were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu polymerase and the following sets of primers: AAG AGA GGA AAC AGC CCT TTG TTT GAT GAG TTG TT and AAC AAC TCA AAC AAA GGG CTG TTT CCT CTC TCT T (NPF to dysferlin C2B sequence SPL) and AAG AGA GGA AAC TGC CCT TTT TTT GAT GAG TTG TT and AAC AAC TCA AAA AAA GGG CTG TTT CCT CTC TCT T (NPF to fer1L4 C2B sequence CPF) as described (14Davis D.B.

Cultures of BL21 cells (Invitrogen) expressing glutathione S-transferase-myoferlin C2 domain fusion proteins were induced for 1 h with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 85 μg/μl. Cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and added to SDS loading buffer. After boiling, 10 μl of lysed cells was loaded on 10% acrylamide gel. For each experiment two gels were used; one was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane used for gel overlay, and the other was stained with GelCode (Bio-Rad). A clone corresponding to the full-length murine cDNA of EHD2 (NCBI accession number AK046566) was obtained from RIKEN (clone ID B430101D12). The cDNA was amplified with the primers EHD2 (forward, ATG TTC AGC TGG CTG AAG AGG GG; reverse, TCA TTC AGC AGA GCC CTT CTG TC) and cloned into pCR T7/NT-TOPO (Invitrogen). 35S-Labeled in vitro transcribed/translated EHD2 was generated using [35S]methionine with the Promega TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate system. The product was separated on a G-25 Sephadex column (Roche Applied Science). The membrane was blocked for 2 h at 4 °C in blocking buffer (0.1% gelatin, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween in 1× PBS, pH .5) then incubated overnight at 4 °C in overlay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) containing the radioactive EHD2 as described (30Chan Y. Kunkel L.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The membrane was washed 4 × 20 min at room temperature in overlay buffer and exposed to film and/or imaged on a PhosphorImager. Immunostaining and Microscopy—Primary myoblasts were grown on gelatin-coated glass coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice, rinsed with PBS, then fixed 2 min on methanol on ice. C2C12 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 10 min on ice followed by 10 min in 0.3% Triton-X100 in 1× PBS on ice. Polyclonal MYOF2 serum (31Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J. Ly C.T. McNally E.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was used at 1:200, goat polyclonal anti-EHD2 (Abcam, ab23935) was used at 1:500, and monoclonal anti-Xpress (Invitrogen) was used at 1:500. Donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa488, donkey anti-goat conjugated to Alexa 594, goat anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa 594, and goat anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa488 were obtained from Molecular Probes and used at 1:2000. Blocking and antibody incubations were done in 1× PBS, 4% donkey serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 with donkey anti-goat and donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. With goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody incubations, blocking and antibody incubations were done in 1× PBS, 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% Triton X-100. Coverslips were mounted using Pro-Long Gold with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were captured using either a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss) or a Leica SP2 scanning laser confocal microscope and LCS Leica Confocal Software. Transferrin Internalization Assay—Myoblasts were grown on sodium hydroxide-treated glass coverslips. Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Cells were incubated with Alexa488-conjugated transferrin (25 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) for 60 min followed by chase with 50 mm deferoxamine, 250 μg/ml holotransferrin in 20% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and mounted for visualization. Myoblast cultures analyzed by flow cytometry were prepared as above but were trypsinized then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS for analysis in a FACS Canto (BD Biosciences). After gating to remove dead cells, aggregated cells, and debris, a minimum of 20,000 events was scored per time point per culture. Cultures were derived from three independent animals per genotype. Fluorescent gates were set to include 97% of wild type cells at time 0 after transferrin removal. The percentage of fluorescent cells was determined on subsequent time points by the number of cells remaining in this gate. Median fluorescence values were determined using a histogram of Alexa488 fluorescence. FACS data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Expression of Wild Type and G65R EHD2—The full-length EHD2 cDNA was amplified with the primers EHD2 (forward, GGT ACC CAT GTT CAG CTG GCT GAA GAA GGG C; reverse, GCG GCC GCT CAT TCA GCA GAG CCT TCT GTC GT) and ligated into the KpnI and NotI sites of pcDNA3.1 His B (Invitrogen), which contains an amino-terminal Xpress epitope tag and a cytomegalovirus promoter. The G65R mutation was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers EHD2 G65R (forward, GTG CTG GTG GCC CGC CAG TAT AGC ACC GGC; reverse, G65R GCC GGT GCT ATA CTG GCG GGC CAC CAG CAC) and Pfu polymerase as described (14Davis D.B. Doherty K.R. Delmonte A.J. McNally E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22883-22888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells were plated at 50,000 cells per well on glass coverslips in 6-well plates. The following day each well was transfected with 5 mg of DNA using Lipofectamine Plus and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were differentiated or fixed, stained, and imaged as described above. Identification of EHD2 as a Myoferlin Interacting Protein—Because myoferlin is abundantly expressed in prefusion myoblasts, C2C12 cells were grown to confluence in 10% fetal bovine serum to enrich for myoblasts in the early phases of fusion. As shown in Fig. 1, the polyclonal anti-myoferlin antibody, MYOF3, immunoprecipitated myoferlin as well as a protein of ∼65 kDa (arrow in Fig. 1B). After determining that this band appeared reproducibly, the results of repeated experiments were combined and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The Mascot search engine (32Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6814) Google Scholar) was used to identify full-length proteins in the NCBI data base corresponding to the peptides generated by mass spectrometry analysis and to determine which matches were statistically significant. A probability-based Mowse score was determined, and a significance score was set at p < 0.5 for this analysis. From this approach, fourteen full-length proteins contained a sufficiently high match to peptides identified by mass spectrometry. Of these 14, 13 were likely contaminants, as they encoded keratin-related intermediate filament proteins (8 of 14), α globin, the β-2 chain of hemoglobin, complement C3, and two RNA-binding proteins. Two peptides in this analysis corresponded to EHD2 (Eps15 homology domain 2), and the position of these sequences along the EHD2 schematic is indicated in Fig. 1A. We selected this protein for further analysis because EHD2 is a protein of the expected size that localizes in the cytoplasm and the membrane similar to myoferlin. Eps15 homology (EH) domains are found in more than 50 eukaryotic proteins, most of which are involved in regulating membrane traffic and events such as receptor internalization, vesicle transport, and actin polymerization (33Polo, S., Confalonieri, S., Salcini, A. E., and Di Fiore, P. P. (2003) Sci. STKE, re17Google Scholar). EHD2 is a member of a subclass of EH domain-containing proteins differentiated by the presence of a carboxyl-terminal EH domain. EHD2 is predicted to be 61 kDa, very close to the observed size of the protein co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-myoferlin antibody. We immunoblotted cell extracts from the myoblast C2C12 line demonstrating that EHD2 consistently migrated slower than the 62-kDa marker at ∼65 kDa (arrow in Fig. 1C). In addition, immunoblotting with an anti-EHD2 antibody confirmed that EHD2 was immunoprecipitated along with myoferlin in the presence of anti-myoferlin antibodies (Fig. 1D). The antibody to EHD2 was unable to immunoprecipitate EHD2 and, thus, could not be used to determine whether EHD2 antibodies could immunoprecipitate myoferlin (data not shown). EHD2 and Myoferlin Interact Directly—The Eps15 EH domain is composed of ∼100 amino acids, and EH domains are 50–60% conserved among proteins (34Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9530-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). NMR spectroscopy has shown that EH domains contain two EF-hands linked by an anti-parallel sheet (18Confalonieri S. Di Fiore P.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The EH domain recognizes and binds to the motif asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) (35Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This sequence was found in both human and murine myoferlin at amino acids 238–240. When engaged, the NPF motif is predicted to project into a conserved hydrophobic pocket in the EH domain where a conserved tryptophan interacts with the asparagine (36de Beer T. Carter R.E. Lobel-Rice K.E. Sorkin A. Overduin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1357-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 37de Beer T. Hoofnagle A.N. Enmon J.L. Bowers R.C. Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. Overduin M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1018-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The C2B domain of myoferlin shows significant homology to the C2A domain of synaptotagmin I (Fig. 2A). Using the known structure of synaptotagmin, we modeled the myoferlin C2B domain. With this configuration, the NPF motif is located at the beginning of the fourth β strand, protruding from the surface of the domain and accessible for protein-protein interactions (Fig. 2B). Because C2 domains have been previously shown to fold independent of their surrounding sequences (38Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), we assessed each C2 domain of myoferlin individually. We demonstrated a specific and direct interaction between the NPF amino acids in myoferlin C2B and EHD2 (Fig. 2C). EHD2 bound directly to myoferlin C2B but did not bind detectably to the other C2 domains in myoferlin including C2A, C2C, C2D, C2E, or C2F. Consistent with this lack of binding, none of these domains possesses the NPF motif. Two different mutants of the NPF motif were generated to document the specificity of the EHD2-myoferlin interaction. In both mutants we left intact the central proline residue that forms the core of the NPF motif to avoid disrupting the entire C2 domain. The first mutant tested (SPL) represents the residues found in the related protein dysferlin, and the second mutant (CPF) represents the sequences found in fer1l4, another ferlin sequence. This experiment was performed in triplicate and quantified to show that EHD2 binding to both mutants was reduced by 4-fold (Fig. 2D). This binding was not affected by the presence of calcium, and this is consistent with the lack of calcium binding of C2B (data not shown). EHD2 Is Reduced in Myoferlin Null Myoblasts—We found that EHD2 was expressed in myoblasts isolated from muscle. As shown in Fig. 3, EHD2 was expressed in undifferentiated myoblasts enriched near the plasma membrane in punctate structures. When myoblasts were co-stained with the anti-myoferlin antibody MYOF2 and anti-EHD2, overlap in the merged images was seen (Fig. 3A). Confocal imaging (Fig. 3A) showed myoferlin and EHD2 immunostaining at sites enriched along the plasma membrane, consistent with colocalization and a potential role in vesicle trafficking. Myoferlin null mice were previously characterized and have a phenotype of reduced muscle mass and smaller diameter myofibers (15Doherty K.R. Cave A. Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J. Posey A. Earley J.U. Hadhazy M. McNally E.M. Development. 2005; 132: 5565-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). When cultured, myoferlin null myoblasts do not fuse efficiently and generate smaller myotubes (15Doherty K.R. Cave A. Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J. Posey A. Earley J.U. Hadhazy M. McNally E.M. Development. 2005; 132: 5565-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Myoferlin null myoblasts showed a marked reduction in EHD2 compared with wild type control myoblasts (Fig. 3B) and was confirmed by immunoblotting undifferentiated primary myoblasts from control and myoferlin null mice (Fig. 3C). Delayed Endocytic Recycling in Myoferlin Null Myoblasts—Transferrin is a small molecule that is rapidly internalized into cells via the transferrin receptor. Once internalized, transferrin is recycled to the plasma membrane where it can be released to bind iron. Fluorescently labeled transferrin is used commonly to image and measure endocytic recycling. Myoferlin null and wild type control myoblasts were isolated and incubated with fluorophore-labeled transferrin. M"

NHE1 is composed of two domains as follows: an N-terminal membrane domain of ∼500 amino acids and a C-terminal regulatory domain of about 315 amino acids (1Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 4Fliegel L. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2001; 96: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The N-terminal membrane domain is responsible for ion movement, and it is reported to have 12 transmembrane (TM) segments and 3 membrane-associated segments (6Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Transmembrane segment four (TM IV; residues 155–177) has been implicated in the ion transport and inhibitor binding properties of NHE1 (7Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4508-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Counillon L. Noel J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Pouyssegur J.

The sequence of human TM IV of NHE1 is 155FLQSDVFFLFLLPPIILDAGYFL177. The underlined residues have been shown to affect Na+ affinity or the inhibitor resistance of mammalian NHE1 (7Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4508-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Counillon L. Noel J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Pouyssegur J.

Recently, we have shown that prolines 167 and 168 are critical forNHE1 function, targeting, and expression (10Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These data provide a strong case for the importance of many amino acid residues of TM IV in the ion binding, structure, and transport properties of NHE1. In this communication, we examine both structural and functional aspects of TM IV of the NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger. We use cysteine-scanning mutagenesis to characterize which amino acids are important in function and are likely pore-lining residues of TM IV. To study the structure of TM IV, the segment was expressed and purified, and we compared its structure in two different membrane mimetic solvent conditions. This provides insight into structured regions, in our case, without fixing the segment as a whole into a single conformation. The use of solution conditions having a low dielectric constant to mimic a membrane environment has become quite common for structural studies of transmembrane proteins or peptides and has provided structures of isolated protein segments consistent with their structures in the full protein (11Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 12Katragadda M. Alderfer J.L. Yeagle P.L. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11932-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrates that whereas TM IV is structured, only a 4–6-residue stretch of the segment is helical. In addition, we identify Phe161 as a pore-lining residue in NHE1. Materials—15N-Labeled ammonium sulfate and all deuterated NMR solvents were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Pwo DNA polymerase was from Roche Applied Science. Lipofectamine™ 2000 Reagent was from Invitrogen. MTSET and MTSES were from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations in TM IV were made to an expression plasmid containing a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger. The plasmid pYN4-C contains the cDNA of the entire coding of NHE1 with all 10 native cysteine residues mutated to serine as described earlier (10Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Each residue of TM IV was individually mutated to cysteine using the cysteine-less pYN4-C as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using amplification with Pwo DNA polymerase followed by use of the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit as recommended by the manufacturer. Mutations were designed to create a new restriction enzyme site for use in screening transformants. DNA sequencing confirmed the accuracy of the mutations. Cell Culture and Stable Transfection—AP-1 cells were used to examine Na+/H+ exchanger expression and activity. These cells lack an endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger. Stable cell lines were made of all mutants by transfection with Lipofectamine™ 2000 Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol as described earlier (10Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected using 800 μg/ml geneticin (G418), and stable cell lines for experiments were regularly re-established from frozen stocks at passage numbers between 5 and 15. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—To confirm NHE1 expression immunoblot, analysis was used on samples from total cell lysates of AP-1 cells. Cell lysates were made as described earlier (10Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of each sample (100 μg total protein) were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and immunostained using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio/Can, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting and detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize immunoreactive proteins. Densitometric analysis of x-ray films was carried out using NIH Image 1.63 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Cell Surface Expression—Cell surface expression was measured essentially as described earlier (10Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce), and immobilized streptavidin resin was used to remove cell surface-labeled Na+/H+ exchanger. Equivalent amounts of the total and unbound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was as described above. The relative amount of NHE1 on the cell surface was calculated by comparing both the 110- and the 95-kDa species of NHE1 in Western blots of the total and unbound fractions. Results are shown as mean ± S.E. with statistical significance determined by a Mann-Whitney U test. Na+/H+ Exchange Activity and Sulfhydryl-reactive Reagent Inhibition—Na+/H+ exchange activity was measured using a PTI Deltascan spectrofluorometer or a Schimadzu RF 5000 spectrofluorometer. The initial rate of Na+-induced recovery of cytosolic pH (pHi) was measured after acute acid load using 2′,7-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (6Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) carboxyfluorescein-AM (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Ammonium chloride (50 mm for 3 min) was used to transiently induce an acid load, and the recovery in the presence of 135 mm NaCl was measured as described previously (10Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There were no differences in buffering capacities of stable cell lines as indicated by the degree of acidification induced by ammonium chloride. Results are shown as mean ± S.E., and statistical significance was determined using a Mann-Whitney U test. To test the effect of MTSET and MTSES on activity of the NHE1 mutants, we used the standard Na+/H+ exchanger assay with ammonium chloride-induced acidification of the cells. In this case cells were acidified two times as described above. After a first control acidification and recovery, either MTSET or MTSES was added to a final concentration of 10 mm for 10 min in Na+-free buffer. The cells were subsequently washed three times in Na+-free buffer prior to the second ammonium chloride-induced acidification and recovery. To calculate residual activity, Equation 1 was used, % residual activity=pH change after(reagent)pH change without(reagent) ×100%(Eq. 1) Production and Purification of TM IV—We produced TM IV as a fusion protein with the immunoglobulin binding domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1 domain). DNA encoding the residues of human NHE1 amino acids 155–180 (155FLQSDVFFLFLLPPIILDAGYFLPLR-180) was synthesized synthetically in the core facility of the Department of Biochemistry. Two self-annealing primers were designed to flank the protein sequence with Met residues and to change the codon preference to that favored in Escherichia coli. The primers were 5′-CTAGCATGTT TCTGCAGAGCGATGTGTTTTTTCTGTTTCTGCTGCCGCCGATTATTCTGGATGCGGGCTATTTTCTGCCGCTGCGCATGCCCGGGC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGCCCGGGCATGCGCAGCGGCAGAAAATAGCCCGCATCCAGAATAATCGGCGGCAGCAGAAACAGAAAAAACACATCGCTCTGCAGAAACATG-3′. The primers were designed to have overhanging “sticky” NheI and XhoI ends so as to insert into the GEV-1 vector (14Lindhout D.A. Thiessen A. Schieve D. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1786-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The annealed primers were ligated into the cut vector and transformed in E. coli XL1Blue and then later transformed into E. coli (BL21 DE3 pLysS) for protein production. The correct clones were verified by restriction enzyme digests and DNA sequencing. Cultures were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and treated to release the soluble protein as described earlier (14Lindhout D.A. Thiessen A. Schieve D. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1786-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For routine production of the protein, cultures were started from a single colony and grown in logarithmic stages until 2.0 liters. At A600 of 0.8, cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 37 °C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100. The fusion protein was constructed such that a His6 tag flanked the C-terminal Met. This was used for purification of the protein via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The fusion protein was eluted from the column using 1 m imidazole. After purification, the eluted proteins concentrated using an Amicon concentrator and resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na2HPO4. They were then desalted by using a Sephadex G-25 column in 10 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and then were lyophilized to dryness. To cleave the transmembrane segment IV free of GB1, standard techniques were employed. Briefly, a given purified batch of fusion peptide was lyophilized twice out of 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (trifluoroacetic acid; 99%, Aldrich) in water, dissolved to ∼2 mg/ml in 50% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water with excess cyanogen bromide (97%, Aldrich), and allowed to react in darkness for ∼16 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was quenched with an equal volume of deionized water and subsequently lyophilized. Reverse-phase HPLC was used to separate the various peptide products of the cleavage, and fractions containing the TM IV segment were pooled and lyophilized at least twice prior to use. The correct fragment identity was determined by MALDI mass spectrometry. Preliminary experiments produced unlabeled TM IV. Later experiments produced labeled TM IV for more detailed characterization of the peptide structure. For these experiments, E. coli cells were grown in a minimal medium containing 87 mm NaH2PO4, 34 mm K2HPO4, 4 mm MgSO4, 1.8 μm FeSO4, 55.5 mm glucose, pH 7.3. The medium was supplemented with 1 g of (15NH4)2SO4. NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculation—One-mg samples of unlabeled TM IV peptide were prepared in CD3OH; trifluoroethanol: H2O mixtures; CD3OH:CDCl3:H2O (4:4:1 v/v/v); and Me2SO. Note that for CD3OH:CDCl3:H2O, screw-cap NMR tubes (535-TR-7, Wilmad Labglass, Buena, NJ) were used to prevent solvent evaporation. Chemical shifts were referenced internally to DSS at 0.5 mm, with indirect referencing employed for 15N (16Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 500 MHz on a Varian INOVA spectrometer at a variety of temperatures for each solvent. Samples for extended analysis were prepared in Me2SO and in CD3OH:CDCl3:H2O (4:4:1 v/v/v) at ∼2 mm peptide and 1.0 mm DSS. One-dimensional 1H, natural abundance 15N HSQC, TOCSY (60-ms mix; DIPSI spin lock), and NOESY (150-ms mix) experiments were acquired on the NANUC Varian INOVA 800 MHz spectrometer for each sample. Double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy and NOESY spectra at various mixing times were acquired at 600 MHz on either Varian UNITY or INOVA spectrometers. By using uniformly 15N-labeled peptide, the three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (150-ms mixture), TOCSY-HSQC (57-ms mixture, DIPSI spin lock), and HNHA experiments were acquired at 500 MHz on a Varian Inova spectrometer. Spectra were processed either using VNMR (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) or NMRPipe (17Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11632) Google Scholar); spectral analysis was facilitated with Sparky 3 (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). Structure calculation was carried out in CNS version 1.1 (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) using NOE contacts derived from the 150-ms mixing time experiments at 800 MHz and 3J-coupling constants derived from the HNHA experiments at 500 MHz as described by Vuister and Bax (19Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Homonuclear NOESY and HNHA peaks were manually picked in Sparky, and volumes were calculated using Gaussian fits, with motion of the peak center generally allowed; in some cases (<2%) with the NOESY spectra, Sparky's gaussian fit algorithm did not find a convergent solution, and a summed signal intensity was used instead over a manually specified region. Initial NOE calibration was carried out empirically from peak volumes to provide a value in the range of 1.8–5.0 Å. These estimates were used to bin each contact into one of strong (1.8–2.8 Å), medium (1.8–3.6 Å), or weak (1.8–5.0 Å). Peaks with an ambiguous assignment between two possible contacts were assigned to the more conservative contact (where possible) as a starting point. An iterative procedure was employed to refine and prune the NOE contacts using a philosophy similar to that of Wang et al. (20Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8627-8634Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Families of 500–1000 structures were generated by simulated annealing using the default CNS heating and cooling cycles and NOE energetics. NOE violations were analyzed over each ensemble, and any violations observed in more than ∼10% of the ensemble structures were examined in detail. If unambiguous, these were typically lengthened, and if ambiguous, they were reassigned or discarded. During this process, restraints were extended to a fourth “very weak” category (1.8–6.0 Å) as necessary (20Wang J.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8627-8634Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After all major NOE violations were resolved, the three-bond J-coupling values were incorporated directly into the simulated annealing protocol (21Garrett D.S. Kuszewski J. Hancock T.J. Lodi P.J. Vuister G.W. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 104: 99-103Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar) using Karplus coefficients as specified by Vuister and Bax (19Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) for the HNHA experiment for the more structured CD3OH: CDCl3:H2O condition. A further pair of iterations was carried out to optimize the compatibility between 3J-coupling values and NOE restraints. The homoserine lactone residue was incorporated into structure calculations using a protonated residue structure attached to an N-terminal methyl ketone group calculated by MM+ molecular mechanics with bond dipole electrostatics with atomic charges obtained by Restricted Hartree-Fock calculation in HyperChem 3 (Hypercube, Gainesville, FL). XPLO2D 3.2.2 (22Kleywegt G.J. CCP4/ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1995; 31: 45-50Google Scholar) was used to produce CNS topology and parameter files. Structurally convergent segments of the peptide were determined by examining the lowest energy 600 structures out of the final ensemble of 1000 with NMRCORE 1.0 (23Kelley L.A. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); structural features of the 600-member ensemble were analyzed using PROMOTIF-NMR 3.0 (24Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The final sets of restraints have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry 1Y4E) along with the 100 lowest energy structures for the CD3OH:CDCl3:H2O solvent condition. Activity and Expression of NHE1 Mutants—Fig. 1 illustrates a general model of the Na+/H+ exchanger (Fig. 1A) and a schematic model illustrating TM IV (Fig. 1B). To examine which amino acids of TM IV were critical for the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger and which amino acids were pore-lining, we used the cysteine-less Na+/H+ exchanger (cNHE). Each residue in TM IV of cNHE1 was individually mutated to a cysteine residue. Initial experiments examined whether these mutant forms of the Na+/H+ exchanger had activity. Most surprisingly, TM IV was exquisitely sensitive to mutation. Fig. 2 shows the effects of mutation of amino acids of TM IV to cysteine on NHE activity. Substitution of any of the amino acids with cysteine in TM IV resulted in significant reductions of the measurable activity of the protein in all mutants (p < 0.05). In particular, residues Phe155, Leu156, Ser158, Asp159, Phe162, Phe164, Pro167, Pro168, Asp172, Tyr175, and Phe176 retained less than 20% of the control activity. These mutants were not used for further characterization of activity. We have demonstrated previously that Pro178 is not critical for function of NHE1 (10Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 illustrates a Western blot of total cell extracts from AP1 cells stably expressing the single cysteine mutants. Both the mutant and wild-type exchangers displayed the same pattern of immunoreactive bands, with a larger band at ∼110 kDa that represents the glycosylated form of the mature Na+/H+ exchanger and a smaller band at ∼95 kDa that represents an immature form of the exchanger that is not fully glycosylated (10Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Both the native wild-type NHE and the cysteine-less NHE1 showed strong immunoreactive bands of 110 kDa size and a weaker 95-kDa, unglycosylated NHE1. The amount of mature 110-kDa NHE is quantified below each lane in Fig. 3, relative to cNHE1. Cells lines containing the mutants F155C, Q157C, L163C, L166C, I170C, A173C, G174C, Y175C, L177C and possibly S158C and F176C have relatively normal levels of expression. Several cell lines expressed mainly or a high proportion of the 95-kDa form of the protein, including L156C, D159C, F161C, F162C, P167C, P168C, I169C, L171C, Y175C, and F176C. Several cell lines also expressed much less of the mature protein. These mutants included L156C, D159C, V160C, F161C, F162C, F164C, L165C, P167C, P168C, I169C, L171C, and D172C. We examined the sensitivity to MTSET or MTSES of the mutant Na+/H+ exchangers that had greater than 20% residual activity of the cysteine-less NHE1 (Fig. 4). Of the active Na+/H+ exchangers, only F161C was affected by treatment with either MTSET or MTSES. This resulted in decreases in Na+/H+ exchanger activity of ∼60 and 80%, respectively. To confirm that Phe161 was a critical residue, we created the mutant F161K, which introduced a positive charge into this location in the wild-type NHE1 background. This mutant retained only ∼23% of wild-type NHE activity (Fig. 2), had reduced expression (not shown), and reduced surface processing (Table I) relative to wild-type NHE1 supporting the importance of Phe161 in NHE1 function.Table ISummary of subcellular localization in AP-1 cells of wild type (wNHE1), cysteine-less NHE1 (cNHE1), and TM IV Na+/H+ exchanger mutantsCell linePlasma membrane% totalWNHE176.9 ± 5.2CNHE150.6 ± 6.8F155C68.9 ± 5.4L156C47.5 ± 1.4Q157C60.6 ± 2.0S158C65.3 ± 2.2D159C17.3 ± 3.8aValues indicate significantly reduced in comparison to cNHE1 at p < 0.05.V160C54.6 ± 3.6F161C42.2 ± 2.5F161K46.6 ± 6.4aValues indicate significantly reduced in comparison to cNHE1 at p < 0.05.,bValues indicate significantly reduced in comparison to wNHE1 at p < 0.05.F162C26.5 ± 8.2L163C47.5 ± 4.6F164C61.1 ± 0.8L165C48.2 ± 9.4L166C37.5 ± 3.9P167C28.2 ± 9.9P168C47.3 ± 5.3I169C36.6 ± 7.1I170C36.4 ± 2.0L171C64.1 ± 4.2D172C14.5 ± 1.3aValues indicate significantly reduced in comparison to cNHE1 at p < 0.05.A173C41.5 ± 5.6G174C52.8 ± 10.2Y175C46.8 ± 2.2F176C54.4 ± 3.9L177C54.3 ± 7.3a Values indicate significantly reduced in comparison to cNHE1 at p < 0.05.b Values indicate significantly reduced in comparison to wNHE1 at p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Subcellular Localization of the Mutant and Wild-type Na+/H+ Exchangers—We have earlier found that mutation of amino acids of the Na+/H+ exchanger sometimes causes the protein to be targeted to an intracellular location (10Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Murtazina B. Booth B.J. Bullis B.L. Singh D.N. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We therefore used quantitative measurement of the intracellular localization of NHE1 within AP-1 cells. Cells were treated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and then lysed and solubilized, and labeled proteins were bound to streptavidin-agarose beads. An equal amount of the total cell lysate and unbound lysate was separated by size using SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody to identify tagged NHE1 protein. Fig. 5 illustrates examples of the results, and Table I summarizes the results quantitatively. In Fig. 5, the total lanes (T) and intracellular lanes (I) illustrate the NHE1 protein present in these samples. The intracellular lane I was that fraction of the Na+/H+ exchanger that did not bind to the streptavidin-agarose beads. Cysteine-less NHE1 and most of the mutant exchanger proteins were predominantly present on the plasma membrane in similar amounts. Na+/H+ exchanger mutants D159C and D172C were significantly reduced in expression on the plasma membrane of the cell. Correcting the activity of these mutants for changes in targeting (Fig. 2) demonstrated that a significant amount of the apparent reduction in activity was because of mistargeting of these proteins. Nevertheless, both still retained less than half of the activity of the cysteine-less NHE1 protein. Correcting for targeting did not greatly change the values for activity of other"
https://openalex.org/W2060457319,"Wnt signaling is involved in a wide range of developmental, physiological, and pathophysiological processes and is negatively regulated by Dickkopf1 (Dkk1). Dkk1 has been shown to bind to two transmembrane proteins, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRP) 5/6 and Kremen. Here, we show that Dkk1 residues Arg197, Ser198, and Lys232 are specifically involved in its binding to Kremen rather than to LRP6. These residues are localized at a surface that is at the opposite side of the LRP6-binding surface based on a three-dimensional structure of Dkk1 deduced from that of Dkk2. We were surprised to find that the Dkk1 mutants carrying a mutation at Arg197, Ser198, or Lys232, the key Kremen-binding residues, could antagonize Wnt signaling as well as the wild-type Dkk1. These mutations only affected their ability to antagonize Wnt signaling when both LRP6 and Kremen were coexpressed. These results suggest that Kremen may not be essential for Dkk1-mediated Wnt antagonism and that Kremen may only play a role when cells express a high level of LRP5/6.

These results suggest that Kremen may not be essential for Dkk1-mediated Wnt antagonism and that Kremen may only play a role when cells express a high level of LRP5/6. The Wnt family of secretory glycoproteins is one of the major families of developmentally important signaling molecules and plays important roles in embryonic induction, generation of cell polarity, and specification of cell fate. The members are also involved in regulation of a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including bone development, neuronogenesis, adipogenesis, myogenesis, organogenesis, and lipid and glucose metabolism. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway regulates gene transcription by stabilization of β-catenin, which is otherwise degraded by a proteasome-mediated mechanism. This canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is initiated by the binding of Wnts to their two coreceptors, LRP5/6 5The abbreviations used are:LRPlow density lipoprotein receptor-related proteinCMconditioned mediumAPalkaline phosphataseRLUrelative light unit. 5The abbreviations used are:LRPlow density lipoprotein receptor-related proteinCMconditioned mediumAPalkaline phosphataseRLUrelative light unit. and frizzled proteins. LRP5 and LRP6 are single transmembrane proteins that contain four YWTD-epidermal growth factor repeat domains and three low density lipoprotein receptor repeat domains in their extracellular domains. The frizzled proteins are seven transmembrane proteins. Genome sequencing projects have identified 19 Wnt genes in mammals (1Moon R.T. Kimelman D.

Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 1663-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar).Wnt signaling is also regulated by a number of naturally occurring antagonists that include the Dkk molecules. The first Dkk (Xenopus Dkk1) was initially discovered as a Wnt antagonist that plays an important role in head formation (9Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). To date, four members of Dkk have been identified in mammals (10Monaghan A.P. Kioschis P. Wu W. Zuniga A. Bock D. Poustka A.

However, only Dkk1, 2, and 4 have been documented to function as antagonists of canonical Wnt signaling (12Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 13Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr.

The Dkk molecules contain two conserved cysteine-rich domains (15Niehrs C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7469-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Work from our laboratory and others further demonstrated that the second, but not the first, Cys-rich domains of Dkk1 and Dkk2 inhibit canonical Wnt signaling (16Li L. Mao J. Sun L. Liu W. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5977-5981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Brott B.K. Sokol S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6100-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Both Dkk1 and Dkk2 have been shown to bind LRP5/6 with high affinities (12Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 13Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). However, they do not appear to inhibit Wnt signaling by directly competing with Wnt proteins because Wnt signaling requires the first two YWTD-epidermal growth factor repeat domains of LRP5/6, whereas Dkk inhibition depends on the third YWTD repeat domain (12Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).In addition to LRP5/6, Dkk molecules were also found to bind to another cell surface protein called Kremen (19Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). It was shown that Dkk was able to simultaneously bind to LRP5/6 and Kremen and that the ternary complex was rapidly endocytosed, thus preventing the Wnt-LRP interaction. However, it is not known how significant endogenous Kremen is in Dkk-mediated Wnt antagonism in mammalian cells, as most of the observations were made with overexpression systems. In this report, we mapped the LRP6- and Kremen-binding surfaces to the opposite sides of the Dkk1 molecules and revealed that Kremen was not required for Dkk-mediated antagonism in 3T3 and HEK293T cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Luciferase Assay, and Preparation of Conditioned Medium (CM)—The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T and the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 were maintained and transfected as described previously (18Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 20Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. Caruso A.M. McMahon A. Sussman D.J. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 129-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). For luciferase assays, 3T3 cells in 24-well plates were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well and transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA/well, containing 75 ng of luciferase reporter, 25 ng of LEF-1, 150 ng of green fluorescent protein, and 250 ng of LacZ plasmid, by using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Twenty four h, after transfection, the cells were treated with Wnt3a and Dkk1 CM for 6 h and then lysed directly. Luciferase activity was measured as described previously (20Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. Caruso A.M. McMahon A. Sussman D.J. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 129-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Luminescence intensity was normalized against fluorescence intensity of green fluorescent protein. For preparation of conditioned medium of wild-type Dkk1 and its mutants, HEK293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 4 × 105 cells/well and transfected with 1 μg of DNA/well. Conditioned medium was collected 48 h after transfection. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity was then measured and adjusted to the same by adding the control CM, which only transfected with LacZ plasmid. Wnt3a CM was generated from cells stably expressing Wnt3a (ATCC).Plasmids Construction—The wild-type and mutant forms of mouse DKK1 were generated by PCR using the high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase PfuUltra (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. AP and FLAG tags were introduced to the N termini of DKK1 and its mutants between the signal peptide and Dkk coding sequence. The expression of these molecules was driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. The LEF-1 reporter gene constructs were kindly provided by Dr. R. Grosschedl (21Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).DKK1-AP Binding Assay—HEK293T cells seeded in 24-well plates at 4 × 105 cells/well were transfected with LacZ or 20 ng/well LRP6 or 50 ng/well Kremen1 by using Lipofectamine Plus; another LacZ was used to make the total DNA amount to 0.25 μg/well. 24 h later, cells were washed once with cold washing buffer (Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, and 0.5% NaN3) and incubated with the washing buffer containing same amount of DKK1-AP or AP-fused DKK1 mutant CMs on ice for 2 h. The cells were then washed three times with the washing buffer and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The lysates were heated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate endogenous AP, and AP activity was measured by using a Tropix luminescence AP assay kit.Western Blot—Cells were lysed with 30 μ l of 2× SDS loading buffer/well in 24-well plates. The lysates were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Then protein samples were separated by electrophoresis gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 24.8 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) and then probed with antibody in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 25°C. Mouse green fluorescent protein (Covance) was used to probe enhanced green fluorescent protein, and mouse FLAG (Sigma) was used to probe DKK1-AP protein. Blots were then rinsed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20, incubated with the rabbit anti mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase second antibody (Pierce) for 1 h, rinsed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20, and exposed with SuperSignal West Pico stable peroxide solution (Pierce).Data Analysis—Data are shown as the means ± S.E. The AP activity of wild-type Dkk1 in cells expressing Kremen or LRP6 was subtracted from that in cells expressing LacZ and taken as 100%. For Wnt activity data, the difference between the presence and absence of wild-type DKK1 was taken as 100%.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have previously shown that Glu721 on the third YWTD-epidermal growth factor repeat domain of LRP5 plays a critical role in DKK1 binding (18Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that there might be an opposite charged residue, namely a basic amino acid residue, on the DKK1 molecule that may form a salt bridge with Glu721 and hence be required for LRP5/6 binding. Because the second cysteine-rich domain of DKK1 is necessary and sufficient for Wnt inhibition (16Li L. Mao J. Sun L. Liu W. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5977-5981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Brott B.K. Sokol S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6100-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we decided to mutate all of 17 conserved basic amino acid residues within this domain to Glu one by one and test the ability of these mutants to bind to LRP6. We have previously used the Dkk-AP fusion proteins to measure the binding of Dkk to LRP5 and LRP6 (18Zhang Y. Wang Y. Li X. Zhang J. Mao J. Li Z. Zheng J. Li L. Harris S. Wu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, we generated all of these Dkk1 mutants as AP fusion proteins. In addition to LRP5 and LRP6, Dkk1 can also bind to Kremen with a high affinity via its second cysteine-rich domain, and this interaction could also be detected by using the Dkk-AP fusion proteins (19Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested these Dkk1-AP mutants for their ability to bind to both LRP6 and Kremen1 expressed in HEK293T cells compared with wild-type Dkk1-AP fusion proteins. Fig. 1A shows the ability of these 17 Dkk1 mutants to bind to Kremen1 relative to the wild-type Dkk1, whereas Fig. 1B shows their binding to LRP6. Because we have discussed the LRP-binding surface of Dkk in the accompanying article (23Chen L. Wang K. Shao Y. Huang J. Li X. Shan J. Wu D. Zheng J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23364-23370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we focused on Kremen binding in this study. Five Dkk1 mutants, including R197E, R209E, K214E, K217E, and K232E, showed significant loss (>50% reduction) in their binding to Kremen compared to the wild-type DKK1 (Fig. 1A). Among these five mutants, R197E and K232E retained the full ability to bind to LRP6, whereas R209E and K214E show weakly compromised (<40% reduction) and K217E strongly compromised (∼90% reduction) LRP6 binding (Fig. 1B).In the accompanying article (23Chen L. Wang K. Shao Y. Huang J. Li X. Shan J. Wu D. Zheng J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23364-23370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we described the solution of the structure of the second Cys-rich domain of Dkk2 and characterized the LRP6 interaction surface. Because Dkk1 and Dkk2 are highly conserved (64.5% identity), we were able to deduce the Dkk1 structure by molecular modeling (Fig. 2) and found that Arg197, Arg209, Lys214, and Lys232 are located at the opposite side of the LRP6-binding surface that is centered at residues Arg242 and His210. The localization of the LRP-binding and Kremen-binding surfaces to opposite sides of the Dkk molecule is consistent with the observation that both LRP and Kremen can bind to Dkk simultaneously (19Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that Arg197, Arg209, Lys214, and Lys232 form a valley, with Arg197 and Lys232 being the opposing walls and Arg209 and Lys214 at the bottom of the valley. Probably because of the location of residues Arg209 and Lys214 near the center of the molecule, their mutations may cause some minor alterations in the LRP6-binding surface, which results in the small reduction in LRP6 binding. However, there appears to be no simple answer to the effect of Lys217 mutation, which resulted in marked reduction in both LRP6 and Kremen binding by >80% (Fig. 1). The structure shows that the amine group of this residue is exposed at the LRP6-binding surface, which is predicted to form a hydrogen bond with Asp887 of the third YWTD repeat domain of LRP5 (the accompanying article; Ref. 23Chen L. Wang K. Shao Y. Huang J. Li X. Shan J. Wu D. Zheng J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23364-23370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the rest of the molecule is buried inside. Thus, it is possible that its mutation may also affect overall structural integrity and thus disrupt the binding to Kremen.FIGURE 2Schematic representation of a deduced Dkk1 structure. The residues specific for Kremen binding are highlighted in red, whereas those for LRP6 binding are in green. Those that, when mutated, affect both LRP and Kremen binding are highlighted in yellow. The corresponding Dkk2 residues are shown in the parentheses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we wanted to better understand how mutation of Arg197 or Lys232 to Glu resulted in the loss of Kremen binding. The fact that these two mutants still retain their full ability to bind to LRP6 indicates that there should not be a significant global conformational change. Nevertheless, mutation from a basic residue to an acidic residue represents a rather extreme change. Thus, we mutated these two residues to Ala. Although R197A shows slightly more Kremen1 binding than R197E, it is still much weaker than the wild-type Dkk1 in binding to Kremen1 and has only 10% of Kremen-binding ability compared with the wild-type Dkk1 (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, K232A showed no difference from K232E at all. Mutation to Ala, like to Glu, did not affect LRP6 binding either (Fig. 3B). We also generated a mutant carrying the substitution of Ala for both Arg197 and Lys232. This double mutant showed little binding to Kremen1 while retaining the full binding to LRP6 (Fig. 3). We then tested some of the mutants for their ability to bind to Kremen2. Mutants that have low affinities for Kremen1 also show low binding to Kremen2 (Fig. 3, C and D). The fact that the double mutant showed less Kremen binding than either K232A or R197A further suggests that both of these residues contribute significantly to Dkk binding to Kremen. Mutating either of them would significantly affect, and mutating both residues would completely abrogate, the binding. The fact that R197E behaves similarly to the double mutant rather than R197A suggests that Arg197 may interact with an acidic amino acid on Kremen. When Arg197 is mutated to Glu, the mutation would not only prevent the interaction with the presumed acidic residue on Kremen but also might yield an electrostatic repulsion that would further block the interaction. On the contrary, the fact that K232A and K232E showed similar binding to Kremen suggests that Lys232, unlike Arg197, may not interact with an acidic amino acid. Lys232 may contribute to the Dkk-Kremen interaction by forming hydrogen bonds with polar residues on Kremen.FIGURE 3Effect of the substitution of Ala for Arg197 and Lys232 on Kremen and LRP6 binding. HEK293 cells were transfected and assayed as described in Fig. 1. These mutations markedly affected the binding to Kremen1 (A) and Kremen2 (C) but not to LRP6 (B). Dkk levels in the CMs were analyzed by Western blotting (D). CTL, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Kremen has been previously reported to be involved in Dkk-mediated antagonism of Wnt signaling (19Mao B. Wu W.

To test how our Dkk mutants with varying ability to bind to Kremen and LRP6 behave in inhibiting Wnt activity, we examined the ability of all of the Dkk1 mutants to inhibit Wnt activity using a Wnt reporter gene assay that we (16Li L. Mao J. Sun L. Liu W. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5977-5981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. Caruso A.M. McMahon A. Sussman D.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) have used previously. To our surprise, neither R197E nor K232E, which lost most of their ability to bind to Kremen, lost any ability to inhibit Wnt activity (Fig. 4, A and B). The same is true with other Dkk1 mutants that fail to bind to Kremen but retain full LRP6 binding, including the double mutant with the substitution of Ala for both Lys197 and Lys232, regardless of the presence of overexpressed Kremen (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, there is a clear correlation between the ability of the Dkk1 mutants to bind to LRP6 and to inhibit Wnt (Fig. 4). Mutants R242E, K217E, R209E, H210E, and H267E that showed lowest binding to LRP6 also showed the poorest ability to inhibit Wnt. We also tested these mutants in HEK293T cells expressing the Wnt reporter gene; the same results were observed (data not shown). These results suggest that Dkk-Kremen interaction is not required for Dkk to inhibit Wnt signaling in HEK293T and NIH3T3 cells.FIGURE 4Ability of Dkk1 and its mutants to antagonize Wnt activity. A, cells were transfected with the LEF-1 reporter gene plasmids for 24 h and treated with Wnt3a CM in the presence of wild-type or mutant DKK1-AP CMs for 6 h. The basal luciferase activity is 265 RLU. The Wnt3a conditioned medium increased the activity to 3210 RLU, and the presence of wild-type DKK1 conditioned medium reduced it to 1220 RLU. The difference between the presence and absence of wild-type DKK1 is taken as 100%. B and C, cells were transfected and assayed as in A. The luciferase activities in cells treated with Wnt3a CM and control CM (CTL) are defined as 100% in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)After carefully reviewing previous work on Kremen (19Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), we realized that the role of Kremen in mammalian cells was mainly investigated when Kremen and LRP6 were overexpressed. In fact, we were able to reproduce the observations (19Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar); when LRP6 was overexpressed, Dkk1 became inept in inhibiting Wnt signaling unless Kremen was also coexpressed (Fig. 5A). We also tested those Dkk mutants that show poor binding to Kremen but not to LRP6 for their ability to inhibit Wnt signaling in the presence of overexpressed LRP6. These mutants behaved similarly to the wild-type Dkk in the absence of coexpressed Kremen; they showed poor inhibition of Wnt activity. Of note, what was shown here were the maximal effects under the condition; adding more Dkk could not lead to further inhibition (data not shown). When Kremen was coexpressed, these Dkk mutants showed varying degree of resistance to Kremen-facilitated Wnt antagonism compared with the wild-type Dkk1, with R197E and K232A/R197A showing the most resistance (Fig. 5A). The resistance is inversely correlated with the ability of these Dkk mutants to bind to Kremen. Putting together all of the results shown thus far, it is reasonable to conclude that Kremen may not be essential for Dkk to inhibit Wnt signaling and that its role may depend on the levels of LRP6. It appears that only when there is a high level of LRP6, Kremen may be needed to assist Dkk-mediated Wnt antagonism.FIGURE 5Effects of Arg197 and Lys232 mutation on Wnt antagonism in the presence of overexpressed LRP6. Cells were transfected with the LEF-1 reporter gene plasmids, 20 ng of LRP6, 10 ng of Wnt1, 30 ng of wild-type or mutant DKK1, and varying amounts of the Kremen1 cDNA as indicated in the figure for 24 h. An aliquot of the cell lysate was used to determine the luciferase activity (A), and the other was used to determine the expression level (B).

Ser198 and Ser234, which are located at the Kremen-binding surface, and Leu237 and Gln241 at the LRP-binding surface were mutated to Ala to produce S198A, S234A, L237A, and Q241A. Although mutation of Ser198 resulted in a specific defect in Kremen binding (Fig. 6A), but not LRP6 binding (Fig. 6B), the other mutations did not affect either LRP6 or Kremen binding (data not shown).FIGURE 6Specific involvement of Ser198 in Kremen binding. A and B, cells were transfected with Kremen1 (A) or LRP6 (B) and assayed as described in Fig. 1.

Our results also suggest that the interaction between Dkk and Kremen is not essential for Dkk-mediated Wnt antagonism in at least two cell lines (NIH3T3 and HEK293T), but this interaction can play a role in facilitating Dkk-mediated antagonism if the level of LRP5/6 is high. The Wnt family of secretory glycoproteins is one of the major families of developmentally important signaling molecules and plays important roles in embryonic induction, generation of cell polarity, and specification of cell fate. The members are also involved in regulation of a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including bone development, neuronogenesis, adipogenesis, myogenesis, organogenesis, and lipid and glucose metabolism. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway regulates gene transcription by stabilization of β-catenin, which is otherwise degraded by a proteasome-mediated mechanism. This canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is initiated by the binding of Wnts to their two coreceptors, LRP5/6 5The abbreviations used are:LRPlow density lipoprotein receptor-related proteinCMconditioned mediumAPalkaline phosphataseRLUrelative light unit. 5The abbreviations used are:LRPlow density lipoprotein receptor-related proteinCMconditioned mediumAPalkaline phosphataseRLUrelative light unit. and frizzled proteins. LRP5 and LRP6 are single transmembrane proteins that contain four YWTD-epidermal growth factor repeat domains and three low density lipoprotein receptor repeat domains in their extracellular domains.

https://openalex.org/W2020817293,"During animal development, distinct tissues, organs, and appendages are specified through differential gene transcription by Hox transcription factors. However, the conserved Hox homeodomains bind DNA with high affinity yet low specificity. We have therefore explored the structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Hox protein Ultrabithorax and the impact of its nonhomeodomain regions on DNA binding properties. Computational and experimental approaches identified several conserved, intrinsically disordered regions outside the homeodomain of Ultrabithorax that impact DNA binding by the homeodomain. Full-length Ultrabithorax bound to target DNA 2.5-fold weaker than its isolated homeodomain. Using N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants, we demonstrate that the YPWM region and the disordered microexons (termed the I1 region) inhibit DNA binding ∼2-fold, whereas the disordered I2 region inhibits homeodomain-DNA interaction a further ∼40-fold. Binding is restored almost to homeodomain affinity by the mostly disordered N-terminal 174 amino acids (R region) in a length-dependent manner. Both the I2 and R regions contain portions of the activation domain, functionally linking DNA binding and transcription regulation. Given that (i) the I1 region and a portion of the R region alter homeodomain-DNA binding as a function of pH and (ii) an internal deletion within I1 increases Ultrabithorax-DNA affinity, I1 must directly impact homeodomain-DNA interaction energetics. However, I2 appears to indirectly affect DNA binding in a manner countered by the N terminus. The amino acid sequences of I2 and much of the I1 and R regions vary significantly among Ultrabithorax orthologues, potentially diversifying Hox-DNA interactions.

Development of all bilaterally symmetric animals requires reliable temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression by members of the Hox protein family. Hox proteins are expressed in contiguous domains along the anterior-posterior axis, where they regulate region-specific differentiation, patterning, and proliferation (1Lewis E.B.

These dramatic phenotypes underscore the absolute requirement for specific and reliable Hox function in vivo. To regulate development, individual Hox family members control transcription of unique batteries of downstream genes (6Pearson J.C. Lemons D. McGinnis W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). However, the homeodomain of each Hox protein mediates DNA binding with high affinity but extremely low specificity (7Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Otting G. Wuthrich K. Cell. 1994; 78: 211-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 8Hoey T.

Tan X.X. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2001; 11: 145-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the amino acid sequences of Hox homeodomains range from 73 to 98% identical (supplemental Fig. 1), with more similar homeodomain sequences derived from Hox proteins with adjacent expression domains (2Hughes C.L. Kaufman T.C. Evol. Dev. 2002; 4: 459-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. Von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A.

Although homeodomain-DNA contacts are largely conserved (13Billeter M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the more dissimilar homeodomains exhibit some differences in DNA affinity and specificity (11Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. Von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Johnson F.B. Krasnow M.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For instance, the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and Deformed homeodomains bind with a less than 3-fold difference in affinity to the Ubx optimal DNA site (15Li L. Von Kessler D. Beachy P.A. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9832-9839Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This affinity difference is greatly amplified by altering the pH or osmotic strength (15Li L. Von Kessler D. Beachy P.A. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9832-9839Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Li L. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7003-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The DNA binding properties of Hox homeodomains with higher sequence identity appear indistinguishable. For example, the Ultrabithorax and Antennapedia homeodomains are 90% identical, including all DNA-contacting residues. Consequently, DNA affinity and specificity are also very similar (11Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. Von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 17Beachy P.A. Varkey J. Young K.E. Von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I.

Nature. 1999; 397: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, in vivo Ultrabithorax and Antennapedia regulate different genes and drive development of unique body structures; Drosophila midthoracic legs and wings are formed within the Antennapedia expression domain, whereas development of halteres and the posterior-most pair of thoracic legs from analogous tissues requires Ultrabithorax (2Hughes C.L. Kaufman T.C. Evol. Dev. 2002; 4: 459-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 6Pearson J.C. Lemons D. McGinnis W. Nat. Rev.

This disparity between the absolute requirement for distinct Hox activities in vivo and the similarity of homeodomain-DNA recognition in vitro has been termed the “Hox paradox” (12Mann R.S. Chan S.K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This paradox is resolved, in part, through Hox interactions with other transcription factors, increasing specificity by requiring tandem Hox and partner DNA binding sites (20Bondos S.E.

Development. 2007; 134: 3585-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since the expression and activity of many Hox partners is limited to specific tissues, protein interactions potentially provide contextual information to Hox proteins as well as contribute to target site selection (22Gebelein B. McKay D.J. Mann R.S. Nature. 2004; 431: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, a subset of Hox-regulated enhancers lack sites for known Hox partners. Thus, several laboratories, including ours, have been exploring the hypothesis that amino acid sequences outside the homeodomain contribute to differences in binding site selection by Hox proteins during animal development (6Pearson J.C. Lemons D. McGinnis W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 15Li L. Von Kessler D. Beachy P.A. Matthews K.S.

These nonhomeodomain sequences vary significantly between Hox proteins (supplemental Fig. 2) and thus potentially permit distinct Hox functions in vivo. However, little is known about protein structure or function outside the homeodomain (18Passner J.M. Ryoo H.D. Shen L. Mann R.S. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1999; 397: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 29Qian Y.Q. Otting G. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Affolter M. Gehring W.J. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10738-10742Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and very few quantitative studies have examined DNA binding by full-length Hox proteins (17Beachy P.A. Varkey J. Young K.E. Von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Ekker S.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 6941-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Galang C.K. Hauser C.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 4609-4617Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Applying a combination of computational and experimental techniques to the Drosophila Hox protein Ubx, we have identified several evolutionarily conserved disordered domains. Despite their lack of structure, we show that these regions modulate DNA binding by the homeodomain. Differences in DNA binding by Ubx and its homeodomain (UbxHD) as a function of pH were exploited to search for regions that influence ionizable residues in the homeodomain and thus directly impact DNA binding. We show that affinity is modulated by the less conserved, disordered regions of Ubx, providing potential mechanisms to vary DNA binding by Hox proteins despite the highly conserved homeodomain sequence and structure (2Hughes C.L. Kaufman T.C. Evol. Dev. 2002; 4: 459-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. Von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A.

Nature. 1999; 397: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ubx sequences that modulate DNA binding partially overlap the transcription activation domain and known protein interaction domains (20Bondos S.E. Catanese Jr., D.J. Tan X. X Bicknell A.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2774-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), potentially allowing mutual influence of these functions. Structure and Disorder Predictions—The online prediction algorithms IUPred (32Dosztányi A. Csizmók V. Tompa P. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), PONDR (33Romero P. Obradovic Z. Li X. Garner E.C. Brown C.J. Dunker A.K. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Stucture (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1316-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were used to identify potentially disordered regions of Ubx. For IUPred, any score greater than 0.5 was considered disordered. The loops/coils definition and the following parameters were utilized for DisEMBL: Savitzky-Golay smoothing frame 8, minimum peak width 8, maximum join distance 4. The VXLT subroutine searching for long disorder was applied in PONDR. Regions predicted to have secondary structure were identified using the nnpredict and GOR V (Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson) algorithms (35Kneller D.G. Cohen F.E. Landridge R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 36Sen T.Z. Jernigan R.L. Garnier J. Kloczkowski A. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2787-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Construction of UbxIa, UbxIa Deletion Mutants, and UbxHD— The UbxIa gene was cloned into both pET3c and pET19b vectors (Novagen) by PCR with primers that introduce an NdeI site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end following two stop codons. The UbxIa N-terminal truncation mutants were produced from pET19b-UbxIa by engineering a second NdeI restriction cutting site using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), excising the intervening sequence by NdeI digestion, and ligating the remaining plasmid. The mutant that also had a C-terminal truncation (N235C24) was constructed by mutating amino acids 357 and 358 to stop codons in the N235 mutant. Wild-type UbxHD was produced from the original pET3c-HD expression construct, which includes two copies of the UbxHD gene (17Beachy P.A. Varkey J. Young K.E. Von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Ekker S.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 6941-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To simplify mutagenesis, one of the homeodomain genes was first deleted. The three histidine residues in the remaining UbxHD were then mutated to lysine residues to form the HD-HK mutant. All gene sequences were confirmed by sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—UbxIb, UbxIa, and all mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells as described previously (37Bondos S.E. Bicknell A. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 316: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) with the following minor variations. Cells expressing UbxIb, UbxIa, and UbxIa deletion mutants were harvested 105 min after induction, whereas cells expressing UbxHD or HD-HK were collected 120 min after induction. Cells were resuspended in ∼5 ml of collection buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 5% glucose, one-twelfth tablet of Complete Proteinase Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) 2The abbreviation used is: DTT, dithiothreitol. ) and frozen at -20 °C. Untagged UbxIa and UbxIb were purified as described for UbxIb previously (37Bondos S.E. Bicknell A. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 316: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), with the exception that they were eluted from the phosphocellulose column with a 0.2–0.9 m NaCl gradient. UbxIa and all UbxIa truncation mutations, excepting UbxHD, were expressed from the pET19b plasmid to provide a His10 tag at the UbxIa N terminus. A 1-liter cell pellet was thawed at room temperature and lysed in 10–15 ml of buffer containing 800 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, one-quarter tablet of Complete Proteinase Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science), 5% glucose, 5 mm imidazole, and 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0. Released DNA in the cell lysate was digested with DNase I (20 mg/ml, 40 μl) prior to centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with polyethyleneimine (50% (w/v), 200 μl) and recentrifuged. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (4 ml; Qiagen) was preequilibrated with wash buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glucose, 5 mm imidazole, and 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, and gently rocked with cleared cell lysates at 4 °C for 10 min before being poured into the column. Packed resin was washed with 80 ml of wash buffer containing 5 mm imidazole followed by 80 ml of wash buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and finally 40 ml of wash buffer containing 80–100 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted with wash buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. To purify UbxHD and HD-HK, a 1-liter cell pellet was lysed in 10–15 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 800 mm NaCl, 4 mm DTT, one-quarter tablet of complete proteinase inhibitor mixture, and 20 mm EDTA. To digest genomic DNA, 40 μl of 20 mg/ml DNase I and 1 ml of 1.6 m MgCl2 were added, followed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min. PEI (50% w/v, 200 μl) was added to the supernatant, and the sample was recentrifuged. Protein samples were diluted to 100 ml with buffer Z (10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 600 mm NaCl, and 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.8) and loaded onto the column containing phosphocellulose resin preequilibrated with 10 column volumes of buffer Z. After washing with buffer Z until the base line was reestablished, protein was eluted with a 0.6–1.4 m NaCl gradient in buffer Z. Fractions were collected and concentrated using a YM-3 centrifugal filter device (Amicon). Protein was dialyzed into storage buffer containing 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. Aggregation Assay—The aggregation assays of N149 in protein storage buffer and Tris DNA binding buffer (see below) at pH 7.5 with no bovine serum albumin were performed as described previously (37Bondos S.E. Bicknell A. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 316: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Native State Proteolysis—Proteolysis experiments were similar to those described by Hubbard and Beynon (38Hubbard S. Benyon R.J. Benyon R. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes, 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2001: 248-249Google Scholar). Each reaction buffer contains 200 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm DTT. Proteinase K reactions were buffered by 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, trypsin reactions by 50 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, and chymotrypsin reactions by 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Each reaction contained 0.2 ng/μl protease and was initiated by the addition of substrate to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/μl substrate. Reactions were conducted at room temperature (22 °C). The progress of the reaction was evaluated by removing 70 μl from the reaction at the indicated times and mixing with 70 μl 10% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate protein. After a 5-min centrifugation at 18,000 × g, supernatant was removed, and pellets were washed three times with acetone, recentrifuging between each wash. After the final wash, pellets were air-dried, redissolved in 2× SDS sample buffer, and heated 5 min prior to electrophoresis on a 13% 29:1 polyacrylamide gel. Standard protocols were used for the Western blots. For each Western blot, a single primary antibody was used to probe for the presence of a particular Ubx epitope in each band corresponding to a proteolytic product. A series of primary antibodies (39López A.J. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9924-9928Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was used to search for different epitopes as described. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare) was used as a secondary antibody, and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect the bands via film. Circular Dichroism—Far-UV CD spectra profiles of full-length UbxIb and UbxHD were recorded from 200 to 300 nm on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. Full-length UbxIb and UbxHD concentrations were 10.4 and 40 μm, respectively, in buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, and 0.3 mm dithiothreitol (for UbxIb) or no dithiothreitol (for UbxHD), pH 7.5. Spectra were collected in 0.5-nm increments from 200 to 300 nm with a 2-s/point averaging time in a quartz cuvette with a 0.2-cm path length at 4 °C. Data were analyzed with Igor Pro software (WaveMetrics, Inc.). DNA Gel Retardation (Gel Shift) Experiments—Both protein activity and affinity were determined using gel retardation assays. Activity gel retardation assays measured the fraction of protein capable of binding DNA and were performed under stoichiometric conditions, in which the DNA concentration exceeded Kd by at least 10-fold. The affinity gel retardation assays were performed under equilibrium conditions, where DNA concentration was well below Kd, generally 10-13 to 10-10 m, to ensure that the observed binding is independent of DNA concentration (40Rippe K. B.I.F. Futura. 1997; 12: 20-26Google Scholar, 41Swint-Kruse L. Matthews K.S. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 379: 188-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide 40AB (5′-CCGGGCTGCACATGGTTAATGGCCAGTCCACGCGTAGATC-3′) includes the Ubx optimal DNA binding site sequence (underlined) (42Ekker S.C. Young K.E. Von Kessler D.P.

Equimolar amounts of the synthesized sense and antisense strands were annealed and separated from residual single-stranded DNA using a 10% 19:1 polyacrylamide gel. The double-stranded DNA band was excised from the gel, crushed, mixed with 2 volumes of elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and incubated at 37 °C for at least 3 h. DNA samples were purified by filtration, followed by ethanol precipitation. The final product was end-labeled as previously described (20Bondos S.E. Catanese Jr., D.J. Tan X. X Bicknell A. Li L.

DNA binding buffer contained 5 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 or as specified. Total ionic strength was constant in all experiments with variable pH. To prevent competition with specific binding at high protein concentrations, nonspecific DNA was never included in binding reactions. In binding affinity experiments, the concentrations of freshly thawed, active proteins ranged through 4 orders of magnitude, centered on the Kd of each variant. The oligonucleotide concentration was less than 10% of Kd, with ∼100 cpm/μl. Binding reactions with 20 μl of protein and 10 μl of DNA were incubated for 20–25 min at room temperature (22 °C). Retardation gels contained 10%, 19:1 polyacrylamide for UbxHD or 4%, 37.5:1 polyacrylamide for UbxIa and deletions, 0.5× TBE (0.045 m Tris borate, pH 8.0, 0.001 m EDTA), and 3% glycerol. The gels were preelectrophoresed at 110 V with buffer recirculation for 0.5 h. A 15-μl aliquot of each sample was loaded onto the gels while running at 270 V. After ∼5–8 min, the voltage was reduced to 120 V for a further 1.5 h. The gels were blotted on filter paper, dried on a vacuum slab gel dryer, and exposed to a FUJI phosphorimaging plate for 3–16 h. To analyze the DNA binding data, image plates were scanned on a Fuji Imaging Analyzer BAS1000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). The relative amount of radioactivity within each “bound” and “free” species on the gel was determined by digitizing the gel images using MacBAS 2.0, ImageGauge 4.0, and Multi-Gauge 2.3. Data were analyzed as previously described (15Li L. Von Kessler D. Beachy P.A. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9832-9839Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, analysis of the raw data using Igor Pro established baseline intensity values of the free DNA before and after binding for each gel. These base-line values were used to determine the fraction of free DNA at each protein concentration and to generate the binding curves. Each experiment consisted of one activity (stoichiometric) binding measurement, for which DNA concentration exceeds Kd by at least 10-fold) and three affinity measurements (equilibrium binding measurement, for which DNA concentration must be at least 10-fold lower than Kd). Data from a single experiment were simultaneously fit to yield Kd, which was subsequently adjusted for protein activity (generally around 80% and never less than 60%). Data from at least three experiments, using protein from at least two purifications, were averaged to generate each reported Kd.

The UbxIb isoform contains all possible Ubx sequences and was therefore used to computationally and experimentally assess any possible structure (or lack thereof) outside of the homeodomain (44López A.J.

Genetics. 1994; 136: 979-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the presence of intrinsic disorder is suggested by the extremely high glycine content (17%) of Ubx, compared with ∼7% in an average protein (46Brooks D.J. Fresco J.R. Mol.

The entire activation domain is especially glycine-rich (nearly 27% glycine), whereas the activation-enhancing region of the activation domain is even further enriched (32% glycine) (Fig. 1A). The range of conformations available to glycine increases the flexibility of glycine-containing polypeptides and tends to disrupt secondary structure (50Creighton T.E.

Overexpression of c-myc in humans correlates with metastases, but transgenic mice only show low rates of micrometastases. We have generated transgenic mice that overexpress both c-myc and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Myc/VEGF) in the mammary gland, which develop high rates of pulmonary macrometastases. Gene expression profiling revealed a set of deregulated genes in Myc/VEGF tumors compared to Myc tumors associated with the increased metastatic phenotype. Cross-comparisons between this set of genes with a human breast cancer lung metastasis gene signature identified five common targets: tenascin-C(TNC), matrix metalloprotease-2, collagen-6-A1, mannosidase-α-1A and HLA-DPA1. Signaling blockade or knockdown of TNC in MDA-MB-435 cells resulted in a significant impairment of cell migration and anchorage-independent cell proliferation. Mice injected with clonal MDA-MB-435 cells with reduced expression of TNC demonstrated a significant decrease (P<0.05) in (1) primary tumor growth; (2) tumor relapse after surgical removal of the primary tumor and (3) incidence of lung metastasis. Our results demonstrate that VEGF induces complex alterations in tissue architecture and gene expression. The TNC signaling pathway plays an important role in mammary tumor growth and metastases, suggesting that TNC may be a relevant target for therapy against metastatic breast cancer."

However, the three isoforms of InsP3R are reported to respond to ATP with differing sensitivities. Ca2+ release through InsP3R1 is positively regulated at lower ATP concentrations than InsP3R3, and InsP3R2 has been reported to be insensitive to ATP modulation. We have reexamined these differences by studying the effects of ATP on InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 expressed in isolation on a null background in DT40 InsP3R knockout cells. We report that the Ca2+-releasing activity as well as the single channel open probability of InsP3R2 was enhanced by ATP, but only at submaximal InsP3 levels. Further, InsP3R2 was more sensitive to ATP modulation than InsP3R3 under similar experimental conditions. Mutations in the ATPB sites of InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 were generated, and the functional consequences of these mutations were tested. Surprisingly, mutation of the ATPB site in InsP3R3 had no effect on ATP modulation, suggesting an additional locus for the effects of ATP on this isoform.

InsP3R act as InsP3-gated channels that release Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores into the cytosol upon activation (1Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P.

Sequence diversity, especially in the regions outside the conserved NH2-terminal InsP3-binding and COOH-terminal channel-forming domains, probably results in differential modulation of the three InsP3R isoforms by cellular factors, including Ca2+, ATP, protein kinases, and binding proteins (7Bezprozvanny I.

Isoform-specific modulation by these factors may partially account for the complex spatial and temporal diversity of intracellular Ca2+ signals displayed by mammalian cells. ATP enhances InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum stores in a variety of cell types expressing mixed or homogenous InsP3R populations (10Iino M. J. Gen.

Importantly, this form of modulation does not require hydrolysis, since nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues enhance InsP3R activity to the same extent as ATP (10Iino M. J. Gen.

Analysis of endogenous Xenopus InsP3R or recombinant rat InsP3R3 in Xenopus oocyte nuclear patches has established that ATP acts as an allosteric modulator primarily by enhancing InsP3R stimulation by Ca2+ (8Foskett J.K.

Few studies have compared, in isolation, the effects of ATP on the three InsP3R isoforms under identical experimental conditions (13Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 15Tu H. Wang Z. Nosyreva E. Smedt H.De Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1046-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The limited data suggest that the relative sensitivity to ATP differs among the three isoforms, with InsP3R1 activity being enhanced by micromolar [ATP] and InsP3R3 being augmented by millimolar [ATP] (15Tu H. Wang Z. Nosyreva E. Smedt H.De Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1046-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, InsP3R2 was shown to be functionally insensitive to ATP modulation in Ca2+ release assays as well as in single channel measurements (13Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 15Tu H. Wang Z. Nosyreva E. Smedt H.De Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1046-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The observed differences in sensitivity to ATP modulation are thought to be mediated by differential effects of ATP binding to specific motifs present in the receptors. Three glycine-rich regions (GXGXXG), reminiscent of Walker A motifs found in many ATPases and GTPases, are present in the InsP3R sequences (18Maes K. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Sienaert I. Bultynck G. Zizi M. De Smet P. Casteels R. Smedt De. H. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Wierenga R.K. Hol W.G. Nature. 1983; 302: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). One such motif, termed the ATPA site, is unique to InsP3R1 and is presumed to account for the higher sensitivity of this isoform to modulation by ATP (12Maes K. Missiaen L. De Smet P. Vanlingen S. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Tu H. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Glouchankova L. Iino M. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1995-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The ATPB site is conserved among all three isoforms and is thought to account for the lower sensitivity of InsP3R3 to ATP modulation, since it has a lower affinity for ATP than the ATPA site (12Maes K. Missiaen L. De Smet P. Vanlingen S. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Tu H. Wang Z. Nosyreva E. Smedt H.De Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1046-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although binding of ATP to these motifs has been observed, the effect of mutating these sites has not been thoroughly examined. InsP3R1 harboring the Opisthotonos mutation disrupts the ATPA site, and this construct exhibited a reduced sensitivity to ATP modulation when compared with wild type in lipid bilayers (20Tu H. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Glouchankova L. Iino M. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1995-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, no effect was observed on Ca2+ signaling in DT40-3KO cells expressing this mutant receptor (20Tu H. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Glouchankova L. Iino M. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1995-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An additional site, termed ATPC, is only found in the S2- InsP3R1 splice variant. Prior work from our laboratory established that a mutation in the ATPC site prevented phosphorylation of the receptor by PKA (21Wagner L.E. 2nd, Betzenhauser M.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17410-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To date, no studies exist to support the idea that the ATPB sites mediate any functional effects of ATP binding to InsP3R. The goal of this study was to define what role the ATPB sites has in determining the sensitivity of InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 to ATP modulation. In order to address this question, individual wild type or mutant isoforms were stably expressed in DT40-3KO cells, which are null for InsP3R (22Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). ATP modulation of InsP3R was examined in permeabilized cells using endoplasmic reticulum luminal Ca2+ measurements and using whole cell single channel measurements (25Dellis O. Dedos S.G. Tovey S.C.

Chem. 2008; 283: 751-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our findings establish that, contrary to prior reports, InsP3R2 is enhanced by ATP and is actually more sensitive to ATP modulation than InsP3R3. Further, we demonstrate that despite the two receptors harboring identical ATP binding sites, the effects of mutating these sites were dramatically different. Ablation of the ATPB site in InsP3R2 completely abolished any modulatory effects of ATP, whereas a similar mutation in InsP3R3 had no effect on the ability of ATP to enhance receptor activity. Finally, we show that ATP binding to the ATPB site in InsP3R2 exerts control of the frequency and amplitude of Ca2+ signals in cells expressing InsP3R2. Construction of GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins were created using the pFN2A (GST) Flexi Vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Nucleotides corresponding to amino acids 1943–2013 of mouse InsP3R2 and amino acids 1849–1944 of rat InsP3R3 were amplified by PCR. SgfI and PmeI restriction sites were incorporated into the DNA primers used for PCR amplification. The PCR products were ligated into pFN2A at the SgfI and PmeI sites. This creates a fusion construct with GST at the NH2 terminus of the InsP3R sequences and a tobacco etch virus protease recognition sequence in between to allow cleavage and removal of GST. Constructs with mutations corresponding to G1971A in InsP3R2 and G1922A in InsP3R3 were created and were verified by sequencing. Expression constructs were used to transform BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Promega, Madison, WI) for protein production. Production of recombinant protein, removal of the GST tag, and subsequent purification of InsP3R protein was accomplished as previously described (21Wagner L.E. 2nd, Betzenhauser M.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17410-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). ATP Binding Assay—The fluorescent ATP analog trinitrophenyl-ATP (TNP-ATP) (Invitrogen), which increases fluorescence upon binding to protein (excitation, 403 nm; emission, 546 nm), was used to measure ATP binding to the purified InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 ATPB proteins as previously described (21Wagner L.E. 2nd, Betzenhauser M.J.

A two-step QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) mutagenesis strategy (24Wang W. Malcolm B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar) was used to introduce G5940C, G5946C, and G5955C point mutations into the InsP3R2 cDNA. These mutations code for amino acid substitutions: G1969A, G1971A, and G1974A, respectively. Sequencing of the entire InsP3R2 coding region (GeneWiz, South Plainfield, NJ) confirmed the correct incorporation of the desired mutations but also revealed an additional spurious deviation from the published sequence (T1044A, leading to amino acid substitution I337N). This substitution is unlikely to result in grossly altered receptor function, since the Ca2+ release rates achieved were comparable between the wild type and ΔATPB receptors in the absence of ATP over a range of [InsP3] (see Figs. 2 and 5). Splice-overlap extension PCR of an internal 4225-base pair KpnI fragment of InsP3R3 was used to introduce G5893C, G5899C, and G5908C. These mutations code for amino acid substitutions: G1920A, G1922A, and G1925A, respectively. Correct incorporation of the mutants and the integrity of the amplified region were verified by DNA sequencing (GeneWiz, South Plainfield, NJ).FIGURE 5The ATPB site is required for ATP modulation of InsP3R2.

Cells were then seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates at ∼1000 cells/well and incubated in selection medium for at least 7 days. Wells exhibiting growth after the selection period were picked for expansion. Permeabilized Cell Ca2+ Measurements—InsP3R2- and InsP3R3-expressing stable DT40-3KO cells were loaded with 20 μm furaptra-AM (Teflabs, Austin, TX) at 39 °C for 30 min in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (HEPES-PSS) containing 5.5 mm glucose, 137 mm NaCl, 0.56 mm MgCl2, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Furaptra-loaded cells were permeabilized by superfusion for 1–2 min with 40 μm β-escin in intracellular medium (ICM) containing 125 mm KCl, 19 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.3). Permeabilized cells were then washed in ICM without β-escin for 15 min to facilitate removal of cytosolic dye, and the cells were then superfused in ICM containing 1.4 mm MgCl2, 3 mm Na2ATP, and 0.650 mm CaCl2 (free [Ca2+] of 200 nm, calculated using MAXCHELATOR) to load the intracellular stores. The free [Ca2+] was subsequently maintained at a constant 200 nm throughout all experimental maneuvers and was verified by fluorescent measurement of free Ca2+ in solutions. Prior to application of InsP3, the cells were superfused in ICM without MgCl2 for 1 min to disable SERCA activity. The unidirectional flux of Ca2+ upon InsP3 application was then monitored in the same solution containing various concentrations of InsP3 and ATP by monitoring the emission of the dye above 505 nm following excitation at 340 and 380 nm (exposure for 20 ms, once per second), using a TILL Photonics imaging system. Following the removal of InsP3, refilling of the stores to allow repeated stimulations was accomplished by superfusion of ICM containing MgCl2 and ATP. Ca2+ release events were averages of the 30–50 cells in a field of view. Rates of Ca2+ release were estimated from these average responses by fitting the initial 30-s period of decreasing fluorescence to a single exponential function (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA). Single InsP3R2 Channel Measurements—Whole cell patch clamp recordings of single InsP3R2 channel activity (25Dellis O. Dedos S.G. Tovey S.C. Ur R.Taufiq Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26Dellis O. Rossi A.M. Dedos S.G. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 751-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were taken from DT40-3KO cells stably expressing mouse InsP3R2. K+ was utilized as the charge carrier in all experiments, and free Ca2+ was clamped at 200 nm to favor activation of InsP3R (bath: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 500 μm BAPTA, 250 nm free Ca2+ (pH 7.1); pipette: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 100 μm BAPTA, 200 nm free Ca2+, 5 mm Na2-ATP unless otherwise noted (pH 7.1)). Borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled and fire polished to resistances of about 20 megaohms. Following establishment of stable high resistance seals, the membrane patches were ruptured to form the whole-cell configuration with resistances of >5 gigaohms and capacitances of >8 picofarads. Currents were recorded under voltage clamp conditions at the indicated potentials using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 9. Channel recordings were digitized at 20 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz with a -3 decibel, 4-pole Bessel filter. Activity was typically evident essentially immediately following break-through with InsP3 in the pipette. Analyses were performed using the event detection protocol in Clampfit 9. Channel openings were detected by half-threshold crossing criteria. We assumed that the number of channels in any particular cell is represented by the maximum number of discrete stacked events observed during the experiment. The Po was calculated using the multimodal distribution for the open and closed current levels. Digital Imaging of [Ca2+]i in Intact Cells—InsP3R2- and InsP3R3-expressing stable DT40-3KO cells were washed once in a HEPES-PSS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Cells were then resuspended in bovine serum albumin HEPES-PSS with 1 μm Fura-2/AM (Teflabs Inc., Austin, TX), placed on a 15-mm glass coverslip in a low volume perfusion chamber, and allowed to adhere for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were perfused continuously for 10 min with HEPES-PSS before experimentation to allow complete Fura-2 deesterification. [Ca2+]i imaging was performed using an inverted epifluorescence Nikon microscope with a ×40 oil immersion objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.3). Cells were excited alternately with light at 340 and 380 nm (± 10-nm bandpass filters, Chroma, Rockingham, VT) using a monochrometer (TILL Photonics, Pleasanton, CA). Fluorescence images were captured and digitized with a digital camera driven by TILL Photonics software. Images were captured every 2 s with an exposure of 20 ms and 4 × 4 binning. 340/380 ratio images were calculated online and stored immediately to a hard disk. Intracellular Ca2+ transients were analyzed for frequency and amplitude using the template detection option from the event detection protocol in pClamp9. Transients with a change in 340/380 less than 0.05 ratio units were discarded. Microsomal Preparation and Western Blotting—Microsomal membranes were prepared from nontransfected DT40-3KO or DT40-3KO cells stably expressing InsP3R essentially as previously described (27Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pelleted and resuspended in homogenization buffer (5 mm NaN3, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After homogenization by 60 strokes of a motor-driven Teflon homogenizer, samples were spun in a tabletop centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were spun at 100,000 × g (50,000 rpm in Beckman centrifuge with a TLA100.3 rotor). Membrane pellets were solubilized in Laemmli running buffer, and protein concentrations were determined using Amido Black. Equal amounts of membrane proteins were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were probed with antibodies specific for InsP3R2 or InsP3R3. The InsP3R2 antibody was directed against a unique sequence from rat InsP3R2 (320PDYRDAQNEGKTVRDGELP338). The antibody was produced by Pocono Rabbit Farms and Laboratories (Canadensis, PA). The InsP3R3 antibody was from BD Biosciences. The ATPB Site from InsP3R2 Binds TNP-ATP—ATP has been shown to bind to full-length InsP3R1 and InsP3R3 as well as to purified peptides containing the ATPB sites from both receptor isoforms; however, the ability of ATP to bind to the ATPB site in InsP3R2 has not been tested (12Maes K. Missiaen L. De Smet P. Vanlingen S. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Maes K. Missiaen L. Parys J.B.

This is an important consideration, since a possible explanation for the lack of functional effects of ATP on InsP3R2 is that the ATPB site from InsP3R2 cannot bind ATP. In order to compare the ATP binding properties of the ATPB sites from InsP3R2 and InsP3R3, we generated cDNA constructs encoding GST fused to residues 1943–2013 of InsP3R2 and to residues 1849–1944 of InsP3R3. These fusion proteins contain the glycine-rich putative ATPB sites as well as enough flanking sequence to allow for efficient protein expression and purification. After elution from the GST-agarose and proteolytic removal of the GST tag, binding to the purified ATPB sites was assessed using a TNP-ATP binding assay. Increasing amounts of TNP-ATP were added to 1-mg samples of the purified ATPB proteins, and greater fluorescence indicated binding of the TNP-ATP to the purified proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, TNP-ATP can readily bind to the ATPB sites from both InsP3R2 and InsP3R3, as indicated by the increase in fluorescence with increasing concentrations of TNP-ATP. Additionally, the EC50 values for TNP-ATP binding were similar for both proteins, indicating similar affinities of TNP-ATP for the two binding sites. This could be expected given the high degree of similarity between the receptors in this region but does not necessarily mean that the affinities are the same in the context of the whole receptor. Determination of the absolute affinity of either isoform for ATP was not tenable by this method, because binding was not determined in the context of the full-length receptor and because TNP-ATP binds to proteins with a higher affinity than does unlabeled ATP (29Hiratsuka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3479-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Even with these caveats, the results clearly show that the ATPB site from InsP3R2 can bind ATP. ATP Enhances the Activities of InsP3R2 and InsP3R3—Given that the ATPB from InsP3R2 binds ATP, it is somewhat surprising that functional effects of ATP have not been observed for this isoform. It should be noted that previous studies examining the effects of ATP on InsP3R2 used saturating InsP3 concentrations, raising the possibility that any effects of ATP on InsP3R2 were masked as a result of maximal stimulation (13Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 15Tu H. Wang Z. Nosyreva E. Smedt H.De Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1046-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In order to examine the effects of ATP on InsP3R function over the full range of InsP3 concentrations, we generated DT40-3KO cell lines stably expressing either mammalian InsP3R2 or InsP3R3 in isolation. Cells expressing InsP3R2 or InsP3R3 were loaded with the low affinity Ca2+ sensing dye furaptra, and unidirectional luminal Ca2+ measurements were made in β-escin permeabilized cells. InsP3R activity was determined by fitting the release events to single exponentials. Ca2+ release rates were measured over a range of InsP3 concentrations in the presence and absence of 5 mm ATP in order to observe the effects of ATP on InsP3R function under varied levels of stimulation. Interestingly, the ability of ATP to enhance Ca2+ release from InsP3R2 was strictly dependent on the concentration of InsP3 used for stimulation. Representative recordings from InsP3R2-expressing cells treated with low (0.3 μm) or high (10 μm) InsP3 in the presence and absence of 5 mm ATP are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. ATP clearly enhances Ca2+ release in response to InsP3 levels below 3 μm but is without effect if [InsP3] is higher (Fig. 2C). 5 mm ATP caused a 2-fold shift in the EC50 for InsP3 in cells expressing InsP3R2 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, 5 mm ATP enhanced the Ca2+ release rate from cells expressing InsP3R3 at all InsP3 concentrations tested (Fig. 2, D–F). These data establish for the first time that, in a fashion similar to InsP3R1 and InsP3R3, ATP positively modulates InsP3R2. Additionally, the results highlight possible important differences in the behavior of the receptors under maximal levels of stimulation. Specifically, InsP3R3 activity is enhanced by ATP at supermaximal InsP3 concentrations, whereas InsP3R2 is only subject to modulation at submaximal [InsP3]. Further evidence to support the premise that ATP can modulate InsP3R2 was gained by measuring single InsP3R2 channel activity in DT40 cells. Taylor and co-workers (25Dellis O. Dedos S.G. Tovey S.C.

https://openalex.org/W2031737454,"Survivin is a prosurvival protein overexpressed in many cancers through mechanisms that remain poorly explored, and is implicated in control of tumor progression and resistance to cancer chemotherapeutics. Here, we report a critical role for survivin in the induction of apoptosis by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). We show that TGF-beta rapidly downregulates survivin expression in prostate epithelial cells, through a unique mechanism of transcriptional suppression involving Smads 2 and 3, Rb/E2F4, and the cell-cycle repressor elements CDE and CHR. This TGF-beta response is triggered through a Smad2/3-dependent hypophosphorylation of Rb and the subsequent association of the Rb/E2F4 repressive complex to CDE/CHR elements in the proximal region of the survivin promoter. Viral-mediated gene delivery experiments, involving overexpressing or silencing survivin, reveal critical roles of survivin in apoptosis induced by TGF-beta alone or in cooperation with cancer therapeutic agents. We propose a novel TGF-beta/Rb/survivin axis with a putative role in the functional switch of TGF-beta from tumor suppressor to tumor promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2041224903,"p66Shc is shown to negatively regulate the life span in mice through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Recent reports, however, revealed that p66Shc protein level is significantly elevated in several human cancer tissues and growth-stimulated carcinoma cells, suggesting a mitogenic and carcinogenic role for p66Shc. In this communication, we demonstrate for the first time that p66Shc mediates androgenic growth signals in androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cells through mitochondrial ROS production. Growth stimulation of prostate cancer cells with 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is accompanied by increased p66Shc level and ROS production, which is abolished by antioxidant treatments. However, antioxidant treatments do not affect the transcriptional activity of androgen receptor (AR) as observed by its inability to block DHT-induced prostate-specific antigen expression, an AR-dependent correlate of prostate cancer progression. Elevated expression of p66Shc by cDNA transfection increases the basal cell proliferation and, thus, reduces additional DHT-induced cell proliferation. Furthermore, DHT increases the translocation of p66Shc into mitochondria and its interaction with cytochrome c. Conversely, both redox-negative p66Shc mutant (W134F), which is deficient in cytochrome c interaction, and p66Shc small interfering RNA decrease DHT-induced cell proliferation. These results collectively reveal a novel role for p66Shc-ROS pathway in androgen-induced prostate cancer cell proliferation and, thus, may play a role in early prostate carcinogenesis."

Metabolic genes related to nonphosphorylative sugar metabolic pathways often form a single gene cluster on the genomes of bacteria and Archaea (supplemental Fig. S1). Based on these insights, we here identified homologous gene clusters related to a novel l-rhamnose metabolism between eukaryotes and bacteria. Enzymatic and biochemical characterization revealed that the four metabolic genes encode l-rhamnose 1-dehydrogenase, l-rhamnono-γ-lactonase, l-rhamnonate dehydratase, and l-2-keto-3-deoxyrhamnonate (l-KDR) aldolase. The evolutionary relationship between sugar pathways analogous to ED pathways, including the alternative l-rhamnose pathway, is discussed by significant phylogenetic comparison of metabolic genes.

Samples were applied at 35 °C to an Aminex HPX-87H Organic Analysis column (300 × 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad) linked to an RID-8020 refractive index detector (TOSOH) and eluted with 5 mm H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. If necessary, 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added to samples (0.1 volume) to remove proteins. After filtration, 100 μl of this solution was then analyzed. NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JNM-ECA600 FT NMR spectrometer (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) operating at 600 MHz. Microorganism Strains and Cell Growth—Pichia stipitis CBS 6054 was kindly provided by Dr. T. W. Jeffries (University of Wisconsin). Debaryomyces hansenii NBRC 0083 and Azotobacter vinelandii NBRC 102612 were purchased from the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (Chiba, Japan). Two fungi were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium (10 g of yeast extract, 20 g of peptone, and 20 g of glucose per liter) and in YNB medium (6.7 g of yeast nitrogen base without amino acid/liter) supplemented with 20 g/liter l-rhamnose. A. vinelandii was cultured at 30 °C in medium (pH 7.6), containing 20.0 g of l-rhamnose, 0.5 g of yeast extract, 0.1 g of KH2PO4, 0.8 g of K2HPO4, 0.2 g of MgSO4·H2O, 0.1 g of CaSO4·2H2O, and trace amounts of FeCl3·6H2O and NaMoO4·2H2O per liter. Commonly, l-rhamnose was sterilized separately by filtration and added to each medium. Substrates—All acid-sugars were prepared by hypoiodite-in-methanol oxidization (26Moore S. Link K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1940; 133: 293-311Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) from the corresponding sugars as K+ salt (d-gluconate, d-galactonate, d-arabonate, l-arabonate, and d-xylonate) or Ba2+ salt (l-rhamnonate, l-lyxonate, d-mannonate, l-mannonate, d-fuconate, and l-fuconate). The K+ salt was dissolved in an approximate amount of water, and the pH was adjusted to ∼10.0 with 5 m NaOH. On the other hand, the Ba2+ salt was dissolved by the addition of appropriate H2SO4, and the produced BaSO4 was removed by centrifugation. The pH of the filtrate was adjusted as described above. The solution containing acid-sugar was applied to a column of a AG® 1-X8 resin (200-400 mesh, formate form) (Bio-Rad). The column was washed thoroughly with water and developed with 600 ml of a gradient of 0-0.6 m formic acid. Fractions containing acid-sugar (detected by HPLC) were combined and lyophilized to yield the corresponding lactone-sugar. Acid-sugar was obtained by base hydrolysis of the lactone-sugar, according to the method of Yew et al. (13Yew W.S. Fedorov A.A. Fedorov E.V. Rakus J.F. Pierce R.W. Almo S.C. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14582-14597Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 1H NMR spectrum of l-rhamnonate (600 MHz, D2O) was as follows: δ 4.12 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 1H, C2), 3.99 (dd, J = 2.04 and 5.16 Hz, 1H, C3), 3.86 (m, 1H, C5), 3.58 (dd, J = 2.1 and 7.56 Hz, 1H, C4), and 1.24 (d, J = 6.18 Hz, 3H, C6) (see Fig. 5C). Those of other acid-sugars were almost analogous to those reported by Yew et al. (13Yew W.S. Fedorov A.A. Fedorov E.V. Rakus J.F. Pierce R.W. Almo S.C. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14582-14597Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). l-KDR was enzymatically synthesized from l-rhamnonate with AvLRA3 (l-rhamnonate dehydratase). The reaction mixture (100 ml) consisted of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mm l-rhamnonate, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. After the addition of 50 mg of AvLRA3, the mixture was left at 30 °C overnight. The solution was filtered and then applied to a AG® 1-X8 resin column followed by a 0-0.6 M gradient of formic acid, and fractions containing l-KDR (detected by HPLC) were combined and lyophilized. l- and d-lactaldehyde were chemically synthesized from l- and d-threonine, respectively, according to the method of Huff and Rudney (27Huff E. Rudney H. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1060-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—All enzyme assays were performed at 30 °C. l-Rhamnose 1-Dehydrogenase Assays—l-Rhamnose 1-dehydrogenase activity was assayed routinely in the direction of l-rhamnose oxidation by measuring the reduction of NAD(P)+ at 340 nm at 30 °C using a Jasco spectrophotometer model V-550 (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The standard assay mixture contained 10 mm l-rhamnose in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 mm NAD(P)+ solution (100 μl) with a final reaction volume of 1 ml. l-Rhamnono-γ-lactonase Assay—l-Rhamnono-γ-lactone hydrolase (lactonase) activity was measured by the modified method of Kondo et al. (28Kondo Y. Inai Y. Sato Y. Handa S. Kubo S. Shimokado K. Goto S. Nishikimi M. Maruyama N. Ishigami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5723-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), which is based on the change in absorbance at 405 nm of the pH indicator p-nitrophenol caused by free acid formation from lactone-sugar. The reaction mixture contained 10 mm Pipes-NaOH (pH 6.4), 10 mm l-rhamnono-γ-lactone, and 0.25 mm p-nitrophenol. The substrate solution of lactone-sugar was freshly prepared immediately before the assay. l-Rhamnonate Dehydratase Assay—l-Rhamnonate dehydration activity was monitored by the semicarbazide method (end point detection after 10 min) (29MacGee J. Doudoroff M. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 210: 617-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total reaction mixture of 400 μl was incubated at 30 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm l-rhamnonate, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and a small volume of enzyme. After 10 min, the enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 2 m HCl. To this solution, 300 μl of semicarbazide solution consisting of 1.0% (w/v) semicarbazide hydrochloride and 1.5% (w/v) sodium acetate was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Finally, the reaction mixture was diluted with 500 μl of distilled water, and its absorbance was measured at 250 nm (molar absorption coefficient ϵ = 571 m-1·cm-1). For the continuous assay, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), containing 10 mm l-rhamnonate, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 unit of PsLRA4 (l-KDR aldolase, see below), and 1 unit of l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (from bovine heart, Sigma) was used, and the reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm NADH solution (100 μl) with a final reaction volume of 1 ml. l-KDR Aldolase Assay—l-KDR aldolase activity in the aldol cleavage direction was continuously assayed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm l-KDR, 0.5 mm MnCl2, and 1 unit of LDH. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm NADH solution (100 μl) with a final reaction volume of 1 ml. For activity in the aldol condensation direction, the enzyme (∼0.5 mg/ml) was measured in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm pyruvate, and 10 mm l-lactaldehyde. To estimate the effect of metal ions on the activity of LRA4 proteins, aldol cleavage direction with l-KDR as a substrate was measured in the absence or presence of each metal chloride (0.5 mm). An assay in the presence of Zn2+, l-lactaldehyde dehydrogenase of P. stipitis 3S. Watanabe, S. Piyanart, and K. Makino, unpublished data. was used as a coupling enzyme instead of LDH, because of the significant inhibition of LDH activity (30Wang W. Seah S.Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9447-9455Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Reaction Product Analysis by HPLC—Purified AvLRA3 (∼0.5 mg/ml) was added to 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm l-rhamnonate. Alternatively, purified PsLRA4 or AvLRA4 (∼0.5 mg/ml) was added to 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm l-KDR (for aldol cleavage direction), or 10 mm pyruvate and 10 mm l-lactaldehyde (for aldol condensation). After incubation at 30 °C for 1.5 h, each enzyme product was then analyzed by HPLC, as described above. Purification and Identification of Native l-Rhamnose 1-Dehydrogenase from P. stipitis—P. stipitis cells grown on l-rhamnose were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min, washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) (referred to as Buffer A), and stored at -35 °C until use. The washed cells were suspended in Buffer A, homogenized with an equal volume of glass beads (0.5 mm diameter, Sigma) for 30 min with appropriate intervals on ice using TORNADO® Laboratory Power Mixer (AS ONE Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain cell-free extracts. All purification steps were performed below 4 °C. All chromatography was carried out using anÁKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences) and/or BioAssist eZ system (TOSOH). The cell-free extract was loaded onto a column of HiPrep 16/10 Q FF (1.6 × 10 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A and washed thoroughly with the same buffer. The column was developed with 300 ml of a linear gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl in Buffer A. Active fractions containing l-rhamnose 1-dehydrogenase were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centriplus YM-30 (Millipore) at 18,000 × g for ∼2 h. The enzyme solution was loaded onto a column of HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 pg (2.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a column of ceramic hydroxyapatite type I (1.6 × 5 cm, Bio-Rad), equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed thoroughly with the same buffer and developed with 150 ml of linear gradient 0-0.3 m potassium phosphate in Buffer A. Fractions with high enzymatic activity were combined, concentrated, and loaded onto a column of HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 pg (1.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with Buffer A. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated and run on native-PAGE with 6% (w/v) gel that was then soaked for 1 h at 30 °C in a Zymogram staining solution (31Gennady, P. M. (2002) Handbook of Detection of Enzymes on Electro-phoretic Gels, 2nd Ed., pp. 27-33, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FLGoogle Scholar) consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 10 mm l-rhamnose, 0.25 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.06 mm phenazine methosulfate, and 15 mm NAD+ at 30 °C for 30 min with gentle shaking. Dehydrogenase activity appeared as a dark band. The active band that appeared in staining was cut out and broken down in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 1% (w/v) SDS. Protein was extracted from the gel by vigorous mixing overnight. A 4-fold volume of acetone chilled at -35 °C was then added to the extracts. After cooling for 1 h at -35 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 39,120 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The sample was dissolved in a small volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), containing 5% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) and separated by SDS-PAGE with 10% (w/v) gel. This procedure revealed that a polypeptide with a molecular mass of ∼25 kDa corresponded to l-rhamnose 1-dehydrogenase (see lane 6 in Fig. 3A); therefore, this sample was used for internal peptide fragment analysis by a MALDI quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (MALDI-QIT-TOF MS) (AXIMA QIT, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), according to the standard protocol (32Toda T. Kimura N. Jpn. J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 41: 13-20Google Scholar). Identification of Putative Gene Cluster Related to Sugar Metabolism—Metabolic genes involved in several sugar pathways analogous to the ED pathway were used as a probe (supplemental Table SI). A preliminary homology search using the Fungal Genomic BLAST program distributed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was carried out against the genome sequences of P. stipitis and D. hansenii using the probe protein sequences described above. The significant homologous candidate gene was further examined by estimating whether enzymes belong to the same protein family as probe proteins in the flanking region. Further analysis was carried out against the known genome sequences of microorganisms using amino acid sequences of PsLRA1-4 as a query sequence. In this study, the prefixes Ps (P. stipitis), Dh (D. hansenii), and Av (A. vinelandii) have been added to gene symbols or protein designations when required for clarity. Functional Expression and Purification of His6-tagged Proteins—LRA1-4 genes from P. stipitis, D. hansenii, and A. vinelandii were amplified by PCR using primers containing appropriate restriction enzyme sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends and genome DNA as a template (supplemental Table S2). Each amplified DNA fragment was introduced into BamHI-PstI sites (for all others except PsLRA2 and PsLRA4 genes) or BamHI-SalI (for PsLRA2 and PsLRA4 genes) in pQE-80L (Qiagen), a plasmid vector for conferring N-terminal His6 tag on expressed proteins. Escherichia coli DH5α harboring the expression plasmid for His6-tagged enzymes was grown at 37 °C to a turbidity of 0.6 at 600 nm in Super broth medium (pH 7.0, 12 g of tryptone, 24 g of yeast extract, 5 ml of glycerol, 3.81 g of KH2PO4, and 12.5 g of K2HPO4 per liter) containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin. After the addition of 1 mm of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the culture was further grown for 6 h to induce the expression of His6-tagged protein. Cells were harvested and resuspended in Buffer X (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole). The cells were then disrupted by sonication, and the solution was centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen) equilibrated with Buffer X. The column was washed with Buffer Y (pH 7.0, Buffer X containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 50 mm imidazole instead of 10 mm imidazole). The enzymes were then eluted with Buffer Z (pH 7.0, Buffer Y containing 250 mm imidazole instead of 50 mm imidazole). Five mm MgCl2 (for AvLRA3, PsLRA4, and AvLRA4) and 10% (w/v) glycerol (for AvLRA3) were added to the buffer system. Metabolic Genes Related to Fungal l-Rhamnose Metabolism—Phylogenetic analysis of the equivalent reaction step catalyzing metabolic enzymes is helpful to estimate the evolutionary relationship between sugar pathways analogous to the ED pathway. Classification of these metabolic enzymes based on the “Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins” (COG) is summarized in Fig. 1. On the other hand, metabolic genes often form a single gene cluster on the genomes of bacteria and Archaea (supplemental Fig. S1). Based on these insights, we searched for significant homologs to the known metabolic genes on the genomes of microorganisms. We particularly focused on fungal P. stipitis and D. hansenii, because it is believed that there is an alternative pathway for l-rhamnose metabolism in these microorganisms (33Rigo L.U. Marechal L.R. Vieira M.M. Veiga L.A. Can. J. Microbiol. 1985; 31: 817-822Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Twerdochlib A.L. Pedrosa F.O. Funayama S. Rigo L.U. Can. J. Microbiol. 1994; 40: 896-902Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The schematic conversion of l-rhamnose is different from that of the known bacterial pathway, depending on protein products of the rhaDABSRT operon (35Egan S.M. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and B), and completely analogous to nonphosphorylative sugar pathways (type I), although no gene encoding four metabolic enzymes has been identified so far. As a result, we identified a potential gene cluster related to the sugar metabolic pathway on the genomes of two fungi consisting of LRA1-4 genes. Further bioinformatic analysis revealed that the (partially) homologous gene cluster (together with other putative sugar-related genes) was found on the genomes of not only many fungi (supplemental Fig. S2A) but also several bacteria, including A. vinelandii (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S2B). A. vinelandii can grow on l-rhamnose as a sole carbon source (data not shown), and interestingly, AvLRA4 is not related to the fungal LRA4(s) (see below in detail); therefore, we expressed LRA1-4 proteins of P. stipitis, D. hansenii, and/or A. vinelandii in E. coli cells. Although several expression levels and/or solubility problems were often found, we were successful in homogeneously purifying PsLRA1, DhLRA1, AvLRA1, DhLRA2, AvLRA3, PsLRA4, and AvLRA4 as His6-tagged enzymes (see Fig. 3B, Fig. 4A, Fig. 5A, and Fig. 6A).FIGURE 4Characterization of l-rhamnono-γ-lactonase.

https://openalex.org/W1979274840,"Recent studies have revealed that B-Raf mutations are very common in malignant melanoma and are required for tumor growth and maintenance. The majority of melanoma-associated B-Raf mutations involve a single point mutation, V600E, which results in greatly elevated B-Raf kinase activity and constitutive activation of MAPK/ERK downstream. Here we show that B-RafV600E increases resistance to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and promotes ERK-dependent phosphorylation of the BH3-only proteins Bim and Bad that are involved in setting thresholds for apoptosis. ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Bim resulted in degradation of this BH3-only protein, whereas phosphorylation of Bad has previously been shown to result in its sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins. Consistent with this, inhibition of ERK activity in a panel of melanoma cell lines resulted in stabilization of Bim and dephosphorylation of Bad. Furthermore, apoptosis induced through overexpression of Bad or Bim was efficiently blocked by coexpression of mutant B-RafV600E. However, small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of Bim and Bad expression conferred only modest protection against cytotoxic drugs, whereas oncogenic B-Raf strongly protected against the same stimuli. These observations suggest that B-Raf-initiated inactivation of Bad and Bim only partly contributes to the anti-apoptotic activities of this oncogene and that other points within the cell death machinery are also targeted by deregulated ERK signaling.

Malignant melanoma is notable for its highly aggressive nature and resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (1Houghton A.N. Polsky D. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 275-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Consequently, five-year survival rates for melanoma patients are notoriously poor, and little improvement in treatment modalities for this type of cancer has occurred over the past 40 years (1Houghton A.N.

Here we have explored whether oncogenic B-Raf can suppress apoptosis, potentially contributing to the chemoresistance frequently seen in malignant melanoma. We have found that the constitutively active B-RafV600E mutant can promote robust ERK-dependent phosphorylation and destabilization of the BH3-only protein, Bim. Furthermore, oncogenic B-Raf also induced phosphorylation of Bad, which previous studies have shown results in sequestration of the latter by 14-3-3 phosphoserine-binding proteins. Consistent with this, B-RafV600E increased resistance to apoptosis, and this could be reversed through knockdown of B-Raf but not of C-Raf. These observations suggest that melanoma-associated B-Raf mutations may contribute to chemoresistance in part through ERK-mediated inactivation of the BH3-only proteins Bim and Bad and also at other points within the cell death machinery.

Apoptosis Assays—HeLa cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and were transfected with various plasmid combinations along with a pAAV-GFP-reporter plasmid using GeneJuice (Novagen). After 24 h, GFP-expressing cells were scored for apoptotic morphology, or alternatively, were treated with pro-apoptotic drugs for an additional 12 h prior to enumeration of apoptosis. A minimum of 300 cells was counted in each treatment. Transfection and Western Immunoblotting—To examine the effect of B-RafV600E on BH3-only proteins, HeLa cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates or 2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish. After 24 h, cells were transfected with vector, pEFmB-RafWT, or pEFmB-RafV600E using GeneJuice. Cell lysates were prepared using SDS-PAGE loading buffer and were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein expression was examined by immunoblotting. HEK293T cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells/10 cm plate and transfected with vector, pEFmB-RafWT, or pEFmB-RafV600E using calcium phosphate precipitation.

Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 1878-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). B-RafV600E exhibits elevated kinase activity that has been estimated to be 50–100-fold more potent than wild-type B-Raf (5Wan P.T. Garnett M.J. Roe S.M. Lee S. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Good V.M. Jones C.M. Marshall C.J. Springer C.J. Barford D. Marais R. Cell. 2004; 116: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar); however, it remains unknown how B-RafV600E contributes to the increased chemoresistance seen in melanoma. One way in which deregulated oncogene expression may contribute to resistance toward chemotherapeutic drugs is through increasing the threshold for apoptosis in cells expressing such oncogenes. However, it is unclear whether oncogenic B-Raf can act as an apoptosis-inhibitory kinase. Overexpression of B-RafV600E Blocks Apoptosis—To address this question, we transiently expressed wild-type B-Raf and the oncogenic B-RafV600E mutant in HeLa cells to explore whether either of these kinases could increase resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli. As shown in Fig. 1A, transient overexpression of either wild-type B-Raf or oncogenic B-RafV600E resulted in activation of the downstream kinase, ERK, with oncogenic B-RafV600E being much more effective in this regard, despite similar levels of expression of both proteins. Strikingly, both forms of B-Raf blocked apoptosis in response to actinomycin D, daunorubicin, and cisplatin, with B-RafV600E being considerably more potent than wild-type B-Raf in this regard (Fig. 1B). Thus, deregulated B-Raf activity is capable of raising the threshold for apoptosis, and this correlated with the degree of ERK activation seen upon overexpression of oncogenic versus wild-type B-Raf. B-Raf Promotes Phosphorylation of the BH3-only Proteins Bad and Bim—Because accumulating evidence indicates that BH3-only proteins act as key upstream integrators of diverse forms of cellular stress or damage, we wondered whether one or more of these proteins may be targeted for inactivation by oncogenic B-RafV600E. To address this question, we transiently expressed wild-type B-Raf and B-RafV600E in HEK293T and HeLa cells and examined the effects of this on the stability and SDS-PAGE mobility of multiple BH3-only proteins, including Bim, Bad, Bid, Puma, Bik, and Noxa (Fig. 1, C and D). Notably, we observed marked phosphorylation and degradation of Bim and increased phosphorylation of Bad in cells expressing B-RafV600E (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, the stability and SDS-PAGE mobility of the other BH3-only proteins examined was not affected under the same conditions, with the exception of Noxa, where increases in expression were seen in the presence of oncogenic B-Raf (Fig. 1, C and D). Titration of B-Raf and B-RafV600E into HeLa cells demonstrated that the effects seen on Bim and Bad were robust and broadly correlated with ERK activation status (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of ERK Activity in Melanoma Cells Results in Dephosphorylation of Bim and Bad—The preceding experiments suggested that deregulated activation of B-Raf is associated with increased phosphorylation of Bim and Bad and that this correlated with deregulated ERK activation status. To ask whether ERK activity was required for the effects seen, we repeated these experiments in the presence of the ERK pathway inhibitor U0126. As Fig. 2B illustrates, U0126 treatment almost completely suppressed B-Raf-induced ERK activation and phosphorylation of Bim and Bad. We also used a panel of melanoma cell lines, several of which carried B-RafV600E mutations. As Fig. 2C shows, all of the melanoma cell lines displayed constitutively high levels of phosphorylated ERK, and this was efficiently suppressed using the MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126, but not the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002. Strikingly, inhibition of ERK activity led to a dramatic accumulation and dephosphorylation of Bim and an almost complete inhibition of Bad phosphorylation in all six of the melanoma lines examined. These data strongly suggest that constitutive ERK activation, as a result of Ras/Raf/ERK pathway mutations, directly impacts on the cell death machinery through phosphorylation of Bim and Bad. Furthermore, Noxa levels were also clearly decreased in response to MEK/ERK inhibition (Fig. 2C), in line with the observation that Noxa expression is also influenced by ERK activation status (Fig. 1, C and D). Ablation of B-Raf Results in Spontaneous Apoptosis Associated with Dephosphorylation of Bad and Bim—To confirm that B-Raf was required for the constitutive ERK activation and Bim and Bad phosphorylation seen in the melanoma lines, we used B-Raf-specific siRNA to ablate expression of this protein in the B-RafV600E-positive cell line, SK-MEL-1 (Fig. 3A). As a control, siRNA directed against C-Raf was used. Knockdown of B-RAF expression dramatically reduced the levels of active phospho-ERK in these cells, whereas ablation of C-Raf expression had little effect (Fig. 3, A and D). Furthermore, ablation of B-Raf resulted in dephosphorylation of Bad and Bim, with the latter event being especially noticeable at 72 h post siRNA treatment (Fig. 3, A and D). In contrast, ablation of C-Raf had little effect on Bad and Bim phosphorylation status. Importantly, SK-MEL-1 cells treated with B-Raf-specific siRNA underwent spontaneous apoptosis and were also sensitized toward a range of chemotherapeutic drugs (Fig. 3, B and C). These experiments provided further evidence that oncogenic B-Raf exerts suppressive effects upon the cell death machinery and that this is correlated with the phosphorylation and inactivation of the BH3-only proteins Bad and Bim. Of note, whereas B-Raf knockdown in SK-MEL-1 cells abolished much of the phospho-ERK seen in these cells (Fig. 3, A and D), this was not the case in Ras mutant SK-MEL-2 cells, where B-Raf knockdown had little effect on phospho-ERK levels (Fig. 3E). Instead, silencing of C-Raf in SK-MEL-2 cells led to reduction in phospho-ERK levels in this context (Fig. 3E), highlighting the increased dependence of the B-RafV600E-positive SK-MEL-1 cells on B-Raf for ERK activation. B-Raf-dependent Phosphorylation of Bim Occurs at Ser55 and Ser65—ERK has previously been implicated in the phosphorylation of Bim and Bad in the context of growth factor-mediated suppression of apoptosis (6Ley R.

To further explore the role of ERK in B-RafV600E-mediated Bim phosphorylation, we used a panel of Bim mutants where individual ERK consensus phosphorylation sites at Ser55, Ser65, and Ser100 were mutated to Ala residues by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 4A). Using this panel of mutants, as well as a triple mutant where all putative ERK phosphorylation sites were replaced, we found that the S55A and S65A mutants were both resistant to B-Raf-initiated phosphorylation and degradation (Fig. 4B). Importantly, the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, blocked B-Raf-induced degradation of Bim, confirming that the decreased levels of the latter seen in response to elevated ERK signaling resulted from enhanced proteasome-mediated degradation of Bim under these conditions (Fig. 4C). Oncogenic B-Raf Blocks Bad and Bim-dependent Apoptosis—Because Bim and Bad were phosphorylated as a consequence of B-RafV600E expression, this suggested that this oncogene may repress apoptosis initiated by one or both of these BH3-only proteins. To explore this possibility, we transiently overexpressed Bad or Bim in HeLa cells, in the presence or absence of wild-type or oncogenic B-Raf, and assessed apoptosis under these conditions. Strikingly, oncogenic B-RafV600E afforded substantial protection against Bim-associated apoptosis (Fig. 5A), which is in agreement with its ability to target this protein for phosphorylation and degradation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, B-Raf also protected against apoptosis initiated through overexpression of Bad (Fig. 5B). In contrast, apoptosis initiated by overexpression of Noxa or Bid was poorly inhibited by deregulated B-Raf activity, suggesting that the effects of B-Raf on apoptosis initiated via BH3-only proteins may be relatively specific (Fig. 5, C and D). In line with this, oncogenic B-Raf failed to block apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor receptor ligation (Fig. 5E), which is known to be highly Bid-dependent in HeLa cells (24Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that apoptosis resulting from inhibition of the proteasome is Noxa-dependent (25Qin J.Z. Ziffra J. Stennett L. Bodner B. Bonish B.K. Chaturvedi V. Bennett F. Pollock P.M. Trent J.M. Hendrix M.J. Rizzo P. Miele L. Nickoloff B.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6282-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 26Fernández Y. Verhaegen M. Miller T.P. Rush J.L. Steiner P. Opipari Jr., A.W. Lowe S.W. Soengas M.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6294-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and B-Raf also failed to protect against cell death induced by the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Fig. 5E). B-Raf-mediated Targeting of Bad and Bim Is Not Sufficient to Explain B-Raf-mediated Resistance to Apoptosis—Although Bad and Bim are clearly phosphorylated in response to oncogenic B-Raf, it is not clear whether inactivation of these BH3-only proteins is sufficient to explain the protection seen against diverse pro-apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 1B). To explore this issue, we knocked down expression of Bad and Bim in HeLa cells using specific siRNAs, either individually or in combination, and asked whether this resulted in robust protection from pro-apoptotic stimuli. However, as Fig. 6A illustrates, the protection seen when Bad or Bim were knocked down individually was only minimal, even though expression of both BH3-only proteins was very substantially reduced. Simultaneous knockdown of both Bad and Bim resulted in better protection against actinomycin D and daunorubicin, whereas this had no effect on cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6A). Because Noxa was up-regulated in response to deregulated B-Raf expression (Fig. 1, C and D), we also explored the effects of Noxa ablation, either alone or in combination with Bad and Bim knockdown (Fig. 6B). Triple knockdown of Bad, Bim, and Noxa resulted in greater protection from actinomycin D- and daunorubicin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6B) but was still not as effective as B-Raf overexpression (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, expression of B-RafV600E further augmented apoptosis resistance even in cells where Bad, Bim, and Noxa were knocked down (Fig. 6C), suggesting that oncogenic B-Raf targets multiple points within the cell death machinery to suppress apoptosis. Oncogenic B-Raf Blocks Bax Translocation to Mitochondria—One of the major downstream consequences of BH3-only protein activation is the triggering of Bax and/or Bak oligomerization within mitochondrial outer membranes (20Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Bax/Bak oligomers form a pore or channel that permits the efflux of cytochrome c and other proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, thereby initiating apoptosis through cytochrome c-dependent apoptosome activation. Whereas Bak is constitutively present within the mitochondrial outer membrane, Bax is normally present in the cytoplasm of healthy cells but translocates to mitochondria upon activation. Because the preceding experiments suggested that oncogenic B-Raf could block apoptosis through targeting certain BH3-only proteins for modification in an ERK-dependent manner, we wished to confirm that this oncogene could block Bax activation and translocation to mitochondria. To explore this issue we used a GFP-labeled Bax and expressed this protein in the presence or absence of wild-type or oncogenic B-Raf. As Fig. 7, A and B illustrate, cells transfected with GFP-Bax alone typically underwent apoptosis, but this was significantly inhibited by oncogenic B-RafV600E and to a much lesser degree by wild-type B-Raf. Furthermore, examination of GFP-Bax expression pattern revealed that Bax was localized to mitochondria in a punctate pattern in the majority of cells where Bax was transfected alone (Fig. 7, C and D). However, in sharp contrast, upon cotransfection with B-RafV600E, Bax was localized to the cytoplasm in the majority of cells (Fig. 7, C and D). Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic B-Raf can suppress apoptosis upstream of Bax/Bak-dependent mitochondrial permeabilization through targeting the BH3-only proteins Bim and Bad, and most likely additional proteins that operate upstream of Bax and Bak, for ERK-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation. Here we have shown that oncogenic B-Raf can exert inhibitory effects on the cell death machinery through deregulated ERK activation. Specifically, B-Raf was found to promote ERK-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of the BH3-only protein Bim, as well as phosphorylation of another member of the BH3-only family, Bad. Ablation of B-Raf expression in the B-RafV600E-positive cell line SK-MEL-1 increased the susceptibility of these cells to chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin and daunorubicin and also resulted in spontaneous apoptosis. In contrast, ablation of the related C-Raf kinase did not affect the threshold for apoptosis in the same cell line. Furthermore, ablation of B-Raf expression in SK-MEL-1 cells also led to the dephosphorylation of Bad and Bim and increased stability of the latter. Conversely, transient expression of oncogenic B-Raf suppressed Bad- and Bim-initiated apoptosis. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic B-Raf can target BH3-only proteins within the cell death machinery for inactivation, in an ERK-dependent manner, and can increase resistance to apoptosis initiated through pathways dependent on Bad and Bim. However, knockdown studies involving Bad and Bim demonstrated that targeting of these proteins for inactivation by oncogenic B-Raf was not sufficient to explain the totality of the resistance to apoptosis seen with this oncogene. Thus, in addition to ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Bad and Bim, B-Raf is also very likely to modulate apoptosis at additional points within the cell death machinery. Previous studies have linked the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway with regulation of BH3-only protein stability. Cook and co-workers (6Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of Bim appears to target this protein for polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (6Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J.

ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Bad has previously been linked with sequestration of the latter by the phosphoserine-binding 14-3-3 proteins (27Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J.

Upon withdrawal of interleukin 3 from responsive cell lines, Bad becomes dephosphorylated and is available for displacing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members from Bax and/or Bak, thereby lowering the threshold for apoptosis (27Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated the oncogenic potential of B-RafV600E and its involvement in melanoma progression, whereas other studies have implicated this oncogene in various tumor-promoting functions such as vascular development and melanoma immune evasion (29Hingorani S.R.

Interestingly, cell death induction following inhibition of B-RafV600E in melanoma using siRNA or the Raf inhibitor BAY 43-9006 has also been described, suggesting a dual role for this oncogene in melanoma cell growth and survival (29Hingorani S.R. Jacobetz M.A. Robertson G.P. Herlyn M. Tuveson D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5198-5202PubMed Google Scholar, 33Karasarides M. Chiloeches A. Hayward R. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Scanlon I. Friedlos F.

Here we demonstrate that oncogenic B-RafV600E targets the BH3-only proteins Bim and Bad for inactivation in melanoma cells, suggesting that B-Raf enhances melanoma survival by raising the apoptotic threshold in melanoma cells through constitutive ERK-dependent inhibition of these BH3-only proteins. As Bim and Bad have been implicated in apoptosis induction in response to growth factor withdrawal and anoikis, inactivation of these BH3-only proteins by B-RafV600E may aid the development and progression of melanoma (27Zha J.

Treatment of melanoma cells with B-Raf siRNA sensitized these cells to a number of chemotherapeutic drugs, demonstrating the potential of targeting B-RafV600E in melanoma treatment. Furthermore, ablation of B-RafV600E but not C-Raf in SK-MEL-1 cells resulted in spontaneous apoptosis, suggesting that these cells become highly dependent on the B-Raf oncogene. Previous observations have similarly described enhanced sensitivity of melanoma cells harboring B-RafV600E to MEK inhibition, suggesting that therapy directed against B-RafV600E may specifically reduce melanoma tumors with few adverse effects on normal melanocytes (35Solit, D. B., Garraway, L. A., Pratilas, C. A., Sawai, A., Getz, G., Basso, A., Ye, Q., Lobo, J. M., She, Y., Osman, I., Golub, T. R., Sebolt-Leopold, J., Sellers, W. R., and Rosen, N. Nature 439, 358-362Google Scholar). In addition, preliminary studies using mice models of melanoma demonstrated reduced tumor development and regression of previously existing tumors treated with the MEK inhibitor C1 1040 or short hairpin RNA targeted against B-RafV600E, indicating that B-RafV600E is a promising target for melanoma treatment (30Collisson E.A.

Thus targeting the MAPK pathway in melanoma cells containing the B-RafV600E mutation, in conjunction with conventional chemotherapy, may be an important means of increasing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs and improving survival rates of patients with this form of cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2059266284,"Naturally occurring mutations in the skeletal muscle Ca(2+) release channel/ryanodine receptor RyR1 are linked to malignant hyperthermia (MH), a life-threatening complication of general anesthesia. Although it has long been recognized that MH results from uncontrolled or spontaneous Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, how MH RyR1 mutations render the sarcoplasmic reticulum susceptible to volatile anesthetic-induced spontaneous Ca(2+) release is unclear. Here we investigated the impact of the porcine MH mutation, R615C, the human equivalent of which also causes MH, on the intrinsic properties of the RyR1 channel and the propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release during store Ca(2+) overload, a process we refer to as store overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). Single channel analyses revealed that the R615C mutation markedly enhanced the luminal Ca(2+) activation of RyR1. Moreover, HEK293 cells expressing the R615C mutant displayed a reduced threshold for SOICR compared with cells expressing wild type RyR1. Furthermore, the MH-triggering agent, halothane, potentiated the response of RyR1 to luminal Ca(2+) and SOICR. Conversely, dantrolene, an effective treatment for MH, suppressed SOICR in HEK293 cells expressing the R615C mutant, but not in cells expressing an RyR2 mutant. These data suggest that the R615C mutation confers MH susceptibility by reducing the threshold for luminal Ca(2+) activation and SOICR, whereas volatile anesthetics trigger MH by further reducing the threshold, and dantrolene suppresses MH by increasing the SOICR threshold. Together, our data support a view in which altered luminal Ca(2+) regulation of RyR1 represents a primary causal mechanism of MH."
https://openalex.org/W2044058228,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 plays an important role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. In this study we examined the relationship between TGF-β1 stimulation and the expression of heparan sulfate (HS) 6-O-endosulfatase 1 (Sulf1) in cultured normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) and in murine lungs in vivo. By removing 6-O-sulfates from specific HS intrachain sites on the cell surface, Sulf1 has been shown to modulate the activities of many HS binding growth factors and morphogens including fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. Real time reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that TGF-β1 increased Sulf1 expression in NHLFs in a dose- and time-dependent manner which was accompanied by a decrease in 6-O-sulfated disaccharides as revealed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Decreased ERK activation after FGF-2 stimulation was observed in TGF-β1-treated NHLFs compared with control cells without changes in HS-dependent FGF-2 binding or FGF-2·FR1c complex formation. To study the function of Sulf1, negative control or Sulf1-specific small interference RNA (siRNA)-transfected NHLFs were stimulated with TGF-β1. Enhanced Smad2/3 phosphorylation and elevated total Smad2 protein level were observed in Sulf1 siRNA-transfected cells and were accompanied by enhanced expression of α-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin. In addition, Sulf1 siRNA transfection enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β1. Finally Sulf1 expression was up-regulated in the lungs of mice treated with adenovirus encoding active TGF-β1. Taken together, our data indicate that Sulf1 is a TGF-β1-responsive gene both in vitro and in vivo and may function as a negative regulator of TGF-β1-induced fibrogenesis.

Brody A.R. Environ. Health Perspect. 2000; 108: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Data from both patients and animal models support a pivotal role for transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in the development and progression of PF. TGF-β1 is present at sites of ECM gene expression in fibrotic human lungs (2Khalil N. O'Connor R.N. Flanders K.C. Unruh H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 3Broekelmann T.J. Limper A.H. Colby T.V. McDonald J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The most studied animal disease model for PF, the bleomycin model, is largely driven by TGF-β1 (4Zhao J. Shi W. Wang Y.-L. Chen H. Bringas Jr., P. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Wang X.-F. Warburton D. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2002; 282: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Raghow B. Irish P. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 84: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and studies in mice administered with TGF-β1 adenoviral vectors in the lung show that overexpression of this cytokine alone is sufficient to induce PF (6Sime P.J. Xing Z. Graham F.L. Csaky K.G. Gauldie J. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). In PF, TGF-β1 initiates and sustains fibroblast activation and transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts, which is exemplified by the de novo expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (7Phan S.H. Chest. 2002; 122: 286-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The expression of α-SMA confers the myofibroblast contractile property, which is responsible for the distortion of normal lung architecture (8Zhang H.Y. Gharaee-Kermani M. Zhang K. Karmiol S. Phan S.H. Am J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 527-537PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in both patients and animal models have also shown that myofibroblasts are the primary source of ECM gene expression in the active fibrotic sites (9Kuhn C. McDonald J.A. Am J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1257-1265PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang K. Rekhter M.D. Gordon D. Phan S.H. Am J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 114-125PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, compared with fibroblasts, myofibroblasts have reduced motility and proliferative capacity (11Hetzel M. Bachem M. Anders D. Trischler G. Faehling M. Lung. 2005; 183: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and TGF-β1 provides myofibroblasts protection against apoptosis (12Zhang H.Y. Phan S.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate (HS) is the glycosaminoglycan moiety of the HS proteoglycans, the ubiquitous macromolecules associated with the cell surface, basement membrane, and the ECM (13Rapraeger A.C. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 83-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). HS polysaccharide chains are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and contain repeating disaccharide units of uronic acid (iduronic or glucuronic acid) linked to N-acetylglucosamine. During HS biosynthesis, these disaccharides are selectively sulfated at the N, 6-O, and 3-O positions of the glucosamine and the 2-O position of the uronic acid residues by actions of the HS sulfotransferases (15Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). HS proteoglycans are involved in a wide range of biological processes through their HS chains, which bind to and modify the activities of a diverse repertoire of ligands including growth factors, morphogens, cytokines, chemokines, matrix proteins, and cell adhesion molecules (13Rapraeger A.C. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 83-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 15Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). It is now well established that HS-protein interactions critically depend on the amount and the positions of the O-sulfate groups, in particular, the 6-O-sulfates, which form binding sites for proteins (14Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 16Nakato H. Kimata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, not surprisingly, HS 6-O-sulfation is dynamically regulated during embryonic development (17Yue X. Schultheiss T.M.

HS 6-O-sulfation state can be regulated in two ways; that is, regulated expression of the HS 6-O-sulfotransferases (24Habuchi H. Nagai N. Sugaya N. Atsumi F. Stevens R.L. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15578-15588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that function in the Golgi and further modification at the cell surface or the ECM by the newly identified HS 6-O-endosulfatases, Sulf1 and Sulf2 (25Lamanna W.C.

The first Sulf, QSulf1, was discovered in a molecular cloning screen for Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-responsive genes in quail embryos and was shown to regulate cellular differentiation through modulation of Wnt signaling (26Dhoot G.K.

Subsequently, Sulf1 and the closely related Sulf2 were identified in mammalian species (27Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 2007; 129: 290-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The influence of the Sulfs on the activity of HS-binding proteins active in tumorigenesis, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), suggests that modulation of Sulf activity could serve as a target for therapeutic intervention (29Uchimura K. Morimoto-Tomita M. Bistrup A. Li J. Lyon M. Gallagher J. Werb Z. Rosen S.D. BMC Biochem. 2006; 7: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 30Lai J.P. Chien J.R. Moser D.R. Staub J.K. Aderca I.

Physiol. 1992; 152: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These interactions protect TGF-β1 from proteolytic degradation in vitro and potentiate the activity of TGF-β1 in supporting the anchorage-independent growth of rat kidney fibroblasts (31McCaffrey T.A. Falcone D.J. Vicente D. Du B. Consigli S. Borth W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 32Lyon M. Rushton G. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Importantly, selective loss of N-, 2-O-, or 6-O-sulfates all lead to reduced TGF-β1 activity (32Lyon M. Rushton G. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In lesion diffuse systemic sclerosis (dSSc) fibroblasts, syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 (members of the transmembrane HS proteoglycan, syndecan family) are markedly elevated compared with nonlesion dSSc or normal dermal fibroblasts, and HS side chains in these cells are required for TGF-β-induced contractile phenotype (34Chen Y. Shi-wen X. van Beek J. Kennedy L. McLeod M. Renzoni E.A. Bou-Gharios G. Wilcox-Adelman S. Goetinck P.F. Eastwood M. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Leask A. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 1699-1711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The role of specific sulfation (N-, 2-O-, and/or 6-O-sulfation), however, was not addressed in this study. The above data indicate that HS plays an important role in TGF-β1-induced cellular responses, and changes in HS sulfation may modulate TGF-β1 function. In this study we examined the relationship between TGF-β1 stimulation and the expression of Sulf1 and Sulf2 in normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) and in murine lungs in vivo. Our data reveal that TGF-β1 strongly induces Sulf1 expression both in vitro and in vivo and that Sulf1 may function as a negative regulator of TGF-β1-induced fibrogenesis. Cell Culture—Primary NHLFs and the culture reagent fibroblast growth medium-2 Bullet Kit were obtained from Cambrex Bioproducts (Walkersville, MD). The NHLFs were received at passage 3 and cultured in fibroblast growth medium-2 complete medium. Subconfluent NHLFs were rendered quiescent in fibroblast basal medium (FBM, Cambrex Bioproducts) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) overnight before treatment with TGF-β1 and/or FGF-2 (R&D systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) in the presence or absence of heparin (porcine intestinal mucosal heparin, Sigma). All experiments were performed in FBM containing 0.2% BSA and with cells at passages 5-6. Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Messenger RNA (mRNA) of the gene of interest was quantified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Total RNA was isolated using the RNA mini plus kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription of 0.5-1 μg of total RNA was performed in a total volume of 20 μl using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). One microliter of cDNA was PCR-amplified in 20-μl reactions containing primers at 200 or 400 nm in iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). For 18 S rRNA amplification, 1:100 dilution of cDNA was used. PCR was performed for 35 cycles consisting of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 45 s using an iCycler iQ real time detection system (Bio-Rad). Dilution curves showed that PCR efficiency was 95-105% for all primer sets used. Negative controls included cDNA reaction without reverse transcriptase or RNA and PCR mix lacking cDNA to detect possible contamination.

Transcription was then inhibited by the addition of the RNA polymerase II-specific inhibitor, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB; Sigma) at a final concentration of 50 μm. At various time points after the addition of DRB, total RNA was isolated, and the rate of mRNA degradation was subsequently determined using real-time RT-PCR as previously described (36Sullivan D.E. Ferris M. Pociask D. Brody A.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Heparan Sulfate Disaccharide Analysis—Sulfated glycosaminoglycans from NHLFs cultured in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks were metabolically labeled with 50 μCi/ml sodium [35S]sulfate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in FBM containing 0.2% BSA overnight at 37 °C. Media and cells were then collected separately and treated with Pronase (Sigma) at the concentration of 0.167 mg/ml in 40 mm sodium acetate, 0.32 m NaCl, pH 6.5, at 37 °C overnight. After filtration to remove insoluble materials, total glycosaminoglycans were affinity-purified by anion exchange chromatography with 0.5 ml of DEAE-Sepharose™ Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) packed in Poly-Prep columns (Bio-Rad). The columns were washed with 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.25 m NaCl, pH 6.0, and eluted with 20 mm sodium acetate, 1 m NaCl, pH 6.0. Glycosaminoglycan chains were recovered by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in water. The digestion of HS was carried out in 100 μl of 40 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, containing 3.3 mm CaCl2 and 1 milliunit each of heparitinase I, II, and III (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C overnight. The next morning samples were further boost-digested with 1 milliunit each of heparitinase I, II, and III at 37 °C for 1 h. Digestion was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were then filtered with Ultrafree-MC (5000 molecular weight limit, Millipore Corp. Bedford, MA), and the unsaturated disaccharides in the filtrates were resolved by ion-pairing reverse-phase HPLC (Protein & Peptide C18, Vydac, Deerfield, IL) with appropriate disaccharide standards (Seikagaku) as described (17Yue X. Schultheiss T.M. McKenzie E.A. Rosenberg R.D. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Analysis of FGF-2 Binding and FGF-2·HS·FR1c Complex Formation—For analysis of HS-dependent FGF-2 binding and the assembly of the FGF-2·HS·FR1c signaling complex in situ, NHLFs grown in 8-well chamber slides were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. Before the binding assays, sections were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 m NaCl to remove any endogenous FGFs that may have been bound to the HS on the cell surface. Samples were then blocked in binding buffer (PBS containing 1 mm Ca2+, 0.5 mm Mg2+, and 0.5% BSA) for 1 h. All binding assays were performed at room temperature. To examine FGF-2 binding, cells in the chamber slides were incubated with 0.3 or 1.0 nm FGF-2 (R&D systems) in binding buffer for 1 h. For FGF-2·HS·FR1c complex formation, FGF-2 and FR1c-Fc (R&D systems) were added to the binding buffer together at 0.3 or 1.0 nm/each and applied to the chamber slides for 1 h. Slides were then washed three times in PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. Bound FGF-2 and FGF-2·FR1c were detected with anti-FGF-2 or anti-Fc antibody (R&D systems) followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse 80i epifluorescent microscope equipped with a Cooke SensiCam CCD camera (Applied Scientific Instrumentation, Eugene, OR) and analyzed using IPLab v3.65a Scientific Image Processing Software (BD Biosciences). To confirm that the above binding assays were HS-dependent, selected wells were treated with a mixture of heparitinases I, II, and III (10 milliunits/ml of each in binding buffer) before the addition of FGF-2 or FGF-2·FR1c-Fc. Small Interference RNA (siRNA) Transfection—siRNA against human Sulf1 (catalog #16708A and AM16704) and negative control siRNA (catalog #4611) were obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). Transient transfections of siRNA were performed using Amaxa nucleofection technology (Amaxa, KoeIn, Germany). Briefly, 2 × 106 NHLFs were suspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector™ solution, 200 pmol of control or Sulf1 siRNA were then added, and the solution was mixed gently. Cells were transfected using the T-16 pulsing parameter and immediately transferred into 12-well plates containing pre-warmed culture medium. Cells were allowed to attach to the culture plate in fibroblast growth medium-2 for 4-5 h, washed twice with FBM and 0.2% BSA, and incubated in FBM and 0.2% BSA overnight before TGF-β1 treatment. Knockdown of Sulf1 was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Immunoblot—Total cell extracts (10-20 μg) from NHLFs were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% BSA and then probed with antibodies against phosphor-p44/42 (ERK) MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), total p44/42 (ERK) MAPK, total and phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), α-SMA, γ-tubulin (Sigma), and collagen I and fibronectin (Abcam Inc. Cambridge, MA). Membranes were subsequently incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling) before detection with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL plus, GE Healthcare). Quantification of the immunoblots was performed using NIH ImageJ software. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation was examined using CellTiter 96 nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Treatment of Mice with Adenovirus Encoding Active TGF-β1—Eight-week-old male, pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice (5 per group) were anesthetized with isoflurane, and 1 × 108 plaque-forming units of the replication-deficient adenovirus encoding either GFP (control, AdGFP) or active TGF-β1 (AdTGF-β1223/225) (6Sime P.J.

Mice were sacrificed 5 days later, and lung tissues were harvested, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. RNA was isolated from the right lungs and analyzed as described for NHLFs. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student's t test for two groups and analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's or Dunnett's multiple comparison test when more than two groups were compared. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. All experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results, and representatives are shown. TGF-β1 Induces Sulf1 mRNA Expression in NHLFs—NHLFs express both Sulf1 and Sulf2 at relatively comparable basal levels (based on Ct values of real-time RT-PCR results, not shown). Upon TGF-β1 stimulation, Sulf1 expression was induced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Treatment of NHLFs with as little as 0.05 ng/ml TGF-β1 resulted in an increased level of Sulf1 mRNA, and 0.5 ng/ml TGF-β1 induced the maximum response (7-8-fold). In contrast, the expression of Sulf2 was reduced by TGF-β1, with about 50% remaining at 0.5 ng/ml (Fig. 1A). To further study the kinetics of TGF-β1 induction of Sulf1 mRNA, NHLFs were treated with 0.5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for different time periods, and Sulf1 mRNA levels were analyzed. This time-course study revealed a relatively slow induction of Sulf1 by TGF-β1 (Fig. 1B), with the earliest significant increase observed at 12 h after TGF-β1 exposure. Maximum induction was observed at 24 h, which was maintained at 48 h, the longest time point in this experiment. Increased Sulf1 mRNA levels may result from enhanced transcriptional activity, increased Sulf1 mRNA stability, or both. To examine the mechanisms of Sulf1 up-regulation by TGF-β1, we pretreated NHLFs with 50 μm DRB, an RNA polymerase II inhibitor, before the addition of TGF-β1 (in the presence of DRB) and analyzed Sulf1 mRNA expression 24 h later. As shown in Fig. 2A, inhibition of RNA polymerase II by DRB totally abolished TGF-β1-induced Sulf1 expression, which suggests that increased transcription is indeed responsible for TGF-β1-induced Sulf1 up-regulation. To examine whether TGF-β1 can stabilize Sulf1 mRNA, NHLFs were stimulated with TGF-β1 for 20 h before the addition of DRB to inhibit new mRNA synthesis, and the remaining Sulf1 mRNA was analyzed over time to determine the degradation rate of Sulf1. The results show (Fig. 2B) that Sulf1 has a relatively long half-life (∼24 h), and importantly, Sulf1 mRNA degrades at approximately the same rate in the presence or absence of TGF-β1. Taken together, the above results indicate that transcriptional activation rather than mRNA stabilization is responsible for increased Sulf1 mRNA levels by TGF-β1. The relative slow induction of Sulf1 by TGF-β1 (Fig. 1B) suggests that de novo protein synthesis might be required for TGF-β1-induced Sulf1 expression. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated NHLFs with TGF-β1 in the presence of protein translation inhibitors. Two protein translation inhibitors, cycloheximide and emetine, were used. Unexpectedly, the addition of either cycloheximide or emetine alone resulted in increased Sulf1 mRNA levels (2.8 ± 0.33- and 7.68 ± 0.45-fold increases over control at 10 μg/ml cycloheximide and 10 μg/ml emetine, respectively). The addition of both protein translation inhibitor and TGF-β1 resulted in a further increase (in the case of cycloheximide) or similar level (in the case of emetine) of Sulf1 mRNA. These results suggest that the transcription of Sulf1 mRNA may be under active suppression in unstimulated cells, and the addition of protein translation inhibitors blocks the synthesis of the protein factor(s) responsible for this suppression. TGF-β1 may induce Sulf1 expression through removal of this suppression as well, and the identity of the Sulf1 transcriptional suppressor(s) requires further investigation. TGF-β1 Induces HS 6-O-Desulfation in NHLFs—To determine whether TGF-β1-induced Sulf1 mRNA expression leads to increased Sulf1 activity and thereby reduces 6-O-sulfation levels, sulfated disaccharide composition was analyzed by metabolic labeling of HS with sodium [35S]sulfate followed by HPLC analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, A and C, a significant reduction of trisulfated ΔUA2S-GlcNS6S (NS2S6S) was observed in TGF-β1-treated cells at both 24 h (A) and 48 h (C), with concurrent increase in ΔUA2S-GlcNS (NS2S). This is consistent with previous reports showing that Sulf1 preferentially removes 6-O-sulfates from trisulfated IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-containing sequences found with"

The indolocarbazole alkaloids are typically divided into two major classes dependent upon their structure and mechanism of action (1Prudhomme M. Curr. Med.

Unlike OleY, TylE, and TylF, RebM activity is observed over a broader pH range and cannot be enhanced by divalent metals. However, the most striking unique feature of RebM is its ability to accept a wide range of alternate substrates. Specifically, in addition to the native substrate (Fig. 1B, 13), RebM can tolerate variation on the imide heterocycle, deoxygenation of the sugar moiety, and even indolocarbazole glycoside anomers (17Zhang C. Albermann C. Fu X. Peters N.R. Chisholm J.D. Zhang G. Gilbert E.J. Wang P.G. Van Vranken D.L. Thorson J.S. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RebM was the first secondary metabolite-associated MTase demonstrated to utilize non-natural cofactor analogs of AdoMet, such as synthetic N-mustard adenylates, to provide novel adenylated indolocarbazole conjugates (28Zhang C.

Singh, C. Zhang, and J. S. Thorson, unpublished data. Thus, RebM, and natural product MTases in general, may present spectacular opportunities for rapid enzymatic diversification of therapeutically important complex natural products. In an effort to further our understanding of the mechanism of RebM catalysis and the key structural elements for AdoMet recognition and activation, we report the crystal structure of RebM at 2.65 Å. This work revealed RebM to crystallize as a dimer and adopt a fairly typical MTase structural fold. The location and nature of the putative RebM dimer interface is unique in comparison with other MTases and, based upon gel filtration studies, is likely not critical for catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis of key residues in the AdoMet-binding pocket revealed some tolerance to variation with little overall alteration in structure, AdoMet binding, and/or catalysis. Mutagenesis studies also identified key catalytic residues and confirmed RebM to be a member of the acid/base-dependent O-MTases. As the first crystal structure for a sugar O-MTase, this work may also present a template toward the future engineering of natural product MTases for combinatorial applications.

The culture was grown (28 °C at 250 rpm) to midlog phase (A600 ∼ 0.6) at which point isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a 0.4 mm final concentration. Growth was continued for an additional 4–6 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation (15 min at 5000 × g), and resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole on ice. The cells were lysed via incubation with 1 mg/ml lysozyme (∼50,000 units/mg; Sigma) for 30 min on ice followed by sonication (VirSonic 475; Virtis, Gardiner, NY; 100 watts, 4 × 30-s pulses, ∼1 min between pulses) on ice. Protein was purified with nickel-nitrilo-triacetic acid-agarose resin or spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using the manufacturer’s protocols. The buffer was exchanged with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8, via PD-10 gel filtration columns (GE Healthcare), and the purified enzyme was subsequently concentrated to >10 mg/ml, drop frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For the production of selenomethionine-labeled protein, the E. coli methionine auxotroph strain B834 (DE3) was transformed with the plasmid, and auto-induction medium was used (32Sreenath H.K. Bingman C.A. Buchan B.W. Seder K.D. Burns B.T. Geetha H.V. Jeon W.B. Vojtik F.C. Aceti D.J. Frederick R.O. Phillips J.G.N. Fox B.G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 40: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Protein Crystallization—RebM was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K. The reservoir solution contained 8% (w/v) methyl ether polyethylene glycol 5000, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, and 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The hanging drop consisted of 2 μl of protein solution (12 mg/ml RebM, 50 mm sodium chloride, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution. RebM crystals (rectangular, ∼350 × 50 × 30 μm in size) required 1 month to achieve full size. The crystals were subsequently soaked in increasing concentrations of ethylene glycol in mother liquor up to a final concentration of 20% (v/v) and flash frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Reduction—X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source on Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team beamline 21-ID-D at a temperature of 93 K. Reflections were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 package (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—A total of 12 of 14 potential selenium sites were identified with HySS (34Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.-W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J.

The data were phased via single wavelength anomalous dispersion using autoSHARP with the help of auxiliary programs from the CCP4 suite (36de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) was used to manually build into the density-modified map produced by autoSHARP. Once a sufficient number of residues were assembled within both RebM molecules of the asymmetric unit to accurately determine the noncrystallographic symmetry operator, density modification was carried out with RESOLVE resulting in a higher quality electron density map (39Terwilliger T. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). The structure was then completed through multiple rounds of model building with Coot and refinement with REFMAC (40Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). TLS (translation/libration/screw) groups were incorporated during the final stages of refinement. These groups were selected based on the output of the TLSMD web server (41Painter J. Merritt E.A. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The simulation assumed an SN2 mechanism and was based upon the closely related mycolic acid synthase-mycolic acid ternary complex (42Huang C.C. Smith C.V. Glickman M.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11559-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1KPI). In the superimposed model, 13 was positioned in the cavity above the AdoMet binding site in an equivalent position of mycolic acid, and the 13 4′-hydroxyl was linearly aligned with respect to the methyl donor to facilitate the nucleophilic attack. Model refinement relied upon 200 steps of conjugate gradient minimization as implemented in the CNS (Crystallography and NMR System) model minimization procedure (43Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Topology and parameter files for 13 and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) were obtained from the HIC-Up server (44Kleywegt G. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—RebM mutants were generated with the QuikChange II mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the parent expression plasmid pCST28aRebM as template (17Zhang C. Albermann C. Fu X. Peters N.R. Chisholm J.D. Zhang G. Gilbert E.J. Wang P.G. Van Vranken D.L. Thorson J.S. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. All mutant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing to carry the desired mutations. Synthesis of oligonucleotide primers and sequencing of DNA were performed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotech Center. Plasmids containing the confirmed rebM mutations were then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and the corresponding overproduced recombinant mutant proteins were purified as described for the wild-type enzyme. CD Spectroscopy—To confirm the influence of the targeted RebM mutations upon the global protein fold, all mutant proteins were analyzed by CD spectroscopy. For CD analysis, the mutant proteins were exchanged at 4 °C with buffer (50 mm phosphate, pH 8), and the protein concentration of each sample was subsequently determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). An AVIV model 202 circular dichroism spectrometer (AVIV Associates, Lakewood, NJ) was used to record the CD spectra using a 1-mm-path length quartz cell containing 300 μl of each protein sample (∼0.25 mg/ml) maintained at 25 °C in a thermoelectrically controlled cell holder. Data were collected every 1 nm with an averaging time of 5 s and are expressed as the mean residue ellipticity in units of degrees·cm2/dmol (supplemental Fig. S1). Enzymatic Reactions—The enzyme assay was accomplished as reported previously (17Zhang C. Albermann C. Fu X. Peters N.R. Chisholm J.D. Zhang G. Gilbert E.J. Wang P.G. Van Vranken D.L. Thorson J.S. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0) containing 50 μm 13 (Fig. 1B), 20 μm purified RebM, and 100 μm AdoMet (Sigma) with incubation at 30 °C for 4 h in a total volume of 20 μl. All reactions were quenched by the addition of 20 μl of methanol followed by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g) to remove precipitated protein. Reactions were analyzed using an analytical Varian ProStar high pressure liquid chromatography system (Phenomenex Luna C18, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid with a gradient of 10–100% CH3CN over 20 min at 1.0 ml/min, A316), and reaction products were confirmed as described previously (17Zhang C. Albermann C. Fu X. Peters N.R. Chisholm J.D. Zhang G. Gilbert E.J. Wang P.G. Van Vranken D.L. Thorson J.S. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Kinetic Measurements—Pseudo first-order kinetics were assessed under constant AdoMet concentration (320 μm) and variable 13 concentrations (2.5, 5 10, 25, 50, and 100 μm) and under constant 13 concentration (50 μm) and variable AdoMet concentrations (0.008, 0.032, 0.16, 0.32, 1.6, and 3.2 mm). Assays were conducted in triplicate, and all rates were confirmed to be linear. The kinetic curves were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot with the Enzyme Kinetics module (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Quality of the Maps and the Model—RebM, a 30-kDa protein consisting of 273 amino acids, crystallized as a homodimer, and the structure was refined to a nominal resolution of 2.65 Å. The asymmetric unit contained two protein molecules (labeled A and B), one molecule of S-adenosylhomocysteine per protein, and six ordered water molecules. The first 42 residues of chain A and the first 46 residues of chain B (20 residues of which comprised the amino-terminal His tag in each case) were not modeled because of insufficient electron density. In addition, the surface loop of chain B containing residues 35–40 could not be modeled. The α carbons of the two chains align with a root mean square deviation of 0.514 Å. The final structure was refined to an Rcryst and Rfree of 21.4 and 26.0%, respectively. The slightly high residual values as well as the low ordered solvent content may be related to the extremely strong diffuse scattering observed in the diffraction images. This diffuse scattering was also observed during room temperature data collection suggesting that it was inherent to the crystals and not the result of cryoprotection. The RebM crystals described belong to the space group P43212 with unit cell parameters a = b = 119.2 Å, c = 84.4 Å. Overview of the Structure—In the RebM crystal structure, the two monomers in the homodimer are related by 2-fold crystallographic symmetry (Fig. 2A). The dimer interface in previously reported small molecule MTases is typically found above the substrate binding site and often contains an extra amino-terminal dimerization domain also important for catalysis. In contrast, the RebM dimer interface is composed predominantly of hydrogen bonding interactions encompassing residues Thr211–Asp215 of β-strand-6 aligned in an antiparallel orientation (Fig. 2A). Four backbone-backbone amide-carbonyl hydrogen bonds are involved in the dimerization interface (Fig. 2A), the span of which is quite small overall, comprising only 380 Å2 of the buried surface area (∼3% of the total surface area). Consistent with gel filtration studies that revealed RebM to be a monomer in solution (17Zhang C. Albermann C. Fu X. Peters N.R. Chisholm J.D. Zhang G. Gilbert E.J. Wang P.G. Van Vranken D.L. Thorson J.S. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the relatively small size of the unique RebM dimer interface suggests it to be of low affinity. This is unlike the previously reported small molecule MTases (such as carminomycin 4-O-methyltransferase (DnrK) (27Jansson A. Koskiniemi H. Mantsala P. Niemi J. Schneider G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41149-41156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), 7α-O-carbamoyldeacetylcephalosporin C methyltransferase (CmcI) (45Oster L.M. Lester D.R. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A. Svenda M. van Lun M. Genereux C. Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 546-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), chalcone O-methyltransferase (26Zubieta C. He X.-Z. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2001; 8: 271Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar), isoflavone O-methyltransferase (26Zubieta C. He X.-Z. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2001; 8: 271Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic acid 3/5-O-methyltransferase (46Zubieta C. Kota P. Ferrer J.L. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1265-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar)) wherein the dimer interface is comprised of nearly 30% of the total surface area. Because the dyad-related monomer of RebM does not contribute to the active site of its partner molecule, dimerization does not appear to be necessary for the substrate recognition or transmethylation. In addition to RebM, only two other MTases invoke an atypical β-strand-6 dimer interface. Of these, the caffeoyl-coenzyme A 3-O-methyltransferase (47Ferrer J.L. Zubieta C. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) β-strands of the dimer interface adopt a parallel orientation, whereas the analogous β-strands in sarcosine dimethylglycine methyltransferase (Protein Data Bank code 2O57) align in a RebM-like antiparallel fashion but, unlike RebM, form four salt bridges. In the context of catalysis, caffeoyl-coenzyme A 3-O-methyltransferase dimerization is not critical for activity, whereas the catalytic influence of sarcosine dimethylglycine methyltransferase dimerization has not been reported. Each subunit of RebM folds into a single globular domain responsible for binding AdoMet and the substrate. The domain exhibits a common tertiary structure consisting of a core α/β Rossmann fold, which is characteristic of all other AdoMet-dependent MTases (48Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar), and a unique α-helical cap that forms the top of the active site cavity. In the overall subunit structure, a central parallel β-sheet (β1–β7) is located between helices (α1–α3, α5, and α7) (Fig. 2B). The β-sheet has strand topology β3, β2, β1, β4, β5, β7, β6 containing a single antiparallel strand (β7) and packs against three proximal (α1–α3) and two distal (α5 and α7) helices. Five helices (α4, α6, and α8–α10) form the upper cap of the globular domain, and helices analogous to the latter three commonly interact with the substrates in MTase homologs. Structural Homology—Although this work represents the first reported sugar O-MTase crystal structure, based upon the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB), over 260 functionally diverse MTases have been characterized structurally (49Martin J.L. McMillan F.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 50Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Trends Biochem. Sci"
https://openalex.org/W2068742706,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) can infect a variety of cell types, so the cause of T-cell-specific oncogenesis remains to be elucidated. The trans-activator protein Tax of HTLV-I can promote cell-cycle progression in resting T cells along with induction of cyclin D2 and cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk6) gene expression. Here, we found that Tax cannot induce cell-cycle progression in resting fibroblasts and analysed the molecular basis of the cell-type specificity. Tax activated cyclin D2 and cdk6 promoters in T cells, but not in fibroblasts, depending on its ability to activate the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-κB. Expression of cyclin D2 and CDK6 activated the transcription factor E2F, which is essential for cell-cycle progression, in both T cells and fibroblasts. Short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated inhibition of cyclin D2 and CDK6 induction suppressed Tax-induced activation of E2F in T cells. Finally, shRNA-mediated downregulation of NF-κB p65 or p100 expression reduced Tax-induced activation of cyclin D2 and/or cdk6 promoters and cell-cycle progression in T cells. These results indicate that Tax-induced cell-cycle progression in T cells is mediated, at least in part, through cell-type-specific activation of the cyclin D2 and cdk6 genes through NF-κB and may be important for the cell-type-specific oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1967641707,"Chfr is a checkpoint protein that plays an important function in cell cycle progression and tumor suppression, although its exact role and regulation are unclear. Previous studies have utilized overexpression of Chfr to determine the signaling pathway of this protein in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate, by using three different antibodies against Chfr, that the endogenous and highly overexpressed ectopic Chfr protein is localized and regulated differently in cells. Endogenous and lowly expressed ectopic Chfr are cytoplasmic and localize to the spindle during mitosis. Higher expression of ectopic Chfr correlates with a shift in the localization of this protein to the nucleus/PML bodies, and with a block of cell proliferation. In addition, endogenous and lowly expressed ectopic Chfr is stable throughout the cell cycle, whereas when highly expressed, ectopic Chfr is actively degraded during S–G2/M phases in an autoubiquitination and proteasome-dependent manner. A two-hybrid screen identified TCTP as a possible Chfr-interacting partner. Biochemical analysis with the endogenous proteins confirmed this interaction and identified β-tubulin as an additional partner for Chfr, supporting the mitotic spindle localization of Chfr. The Chfr–TCTP interaction was stable throughout the cell cycle, but it could be diminished by the complete depolymerization of the microtubules, providing a possible mechanism where Chfr could be the sensor that detects microtubule disruption and then activates the prophase checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W2007185935,"Ubiquitin (Ub) is a sorting signal that targets integral membrane proteins to the interior of the vacuole/lysosome by directing them into lumenal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). The Vps27-Hse1 complex, which is homologous to the Hrs-STAM complex in mammalian cells, serves as a Ub-sorting receptor at the surface of early endosomes. We have found that Hse1 interacts with Doa1/Ufd3. Doa1 is known to interact with Cdc48/p97 and Ub and is required for maintaining Ub levels. We find that the Hse1 Src homology 3 domain binds directly to the central PFU domain of Doa1. Mutations in Doa1 that block Hse1 binding but not Ub binding do not alter Ub levels but do result in the missorting of the MVB cargo GFP-Cps1. Loss of Doa1 also causes a synthetic growth defect when combined with loss of Vps27. Unlike the loss of Doa1 alone, the doa1Delta vps27Delta double mutant phenotype is not suppressed by Ub overexpression, demonstrating that the effect is not due to indirect consequence of lowered Ub levels. Loss of Doa1 results in a defect in the accumulation of GFP-Ub within yeast vacuoles, implying that there is a reduction in the flux of ubiquitinated membrane proteins through the MVB pathway. This defect was also reflected by an inability to properly sort Vph1-GFP-Ub, a modified subunit of the multiprotein vacuolar ATPase complex, which carries an in-frame fusion of Ub as an MVB sorting signal. These results reveal novel roles for Doa1 in helping to process ubiquitinated membrane proteins for sorting into MVBs."

Subunit a is a 100-kDa integral subunit of V<sub>0</sub> that plays an essential role in proton translocation. To better define the membrane topology of subunit a, unique cysteine residues were introduced into a Cys-less form of the yeast subunit a (Vph1p) and the accessibility of these cysteine residues to modification by the membrane permeant reagent <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and the membrane impermeant reagent polyethyleneglycol maleimide (PEG-mal) in the presence and absence of the protein denaturant SDS was assessed. Thirty Vph1p mutants containing unique cysteine residues were constructed and analyzed. Cysteines introduced between residues 670 and 710 and between 807 and 840 were modified by PEG-mal in the absence of SDS, indicating a cytoplasmic orientation. Cysteines introduced between residues 602 and 620 and between residues 744 and 761 were modified by NEM but not PEG-mal in the absence of SDS, suggesting a lumenal orientation. Finally, cysteines introduced at residues 638, 645, 648, 723, 726, 734, and at nine positions between residue 766 and 804 were modified by NEM and PEG-mal only in the presence of SDS, consistent with their presence within the membrane or at a protein-protein interface. The results support an eight transmembrane helix (TM) model of subunit a in which the C terminus is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and provide information on the location of hydrophilic loops separating TM6, 7, and 8."
https://openalex.org/W2061792959,"Rac plays a pivotal role in the assembly of the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes. In resting cells, Rac is found in the cytosol in complex with Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI). NADPH oxidase assembly involves dissociation of the Rac·RhoGDI complex and translocation of Rac to the membrane. We reported that liposomes containing high concentrations of monovalent anionic phospholipids cause Rac·RhoGDI complex dissociation (Ugolev, Y., Molshanski-Mor, S., Weinbaum, C., and Pick, E. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 19204-19219 ). We now designed an in vitro model mimicking membrane phospholipid remodeling during phagocyte stimulation in vivo. We showed that liposomes of “resting cell membrane” composition (less than 20 mol % monovalent anionic phospholipids), supplemented with 1 mol % of polyvalent anionic phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in conjunction with constitutively active forms of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rac, Trio, or Tiam1 and a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, cause dissociation of Rac1(GDP)·RhoGDI complexes, GDP to GTP exchange on Rac1, and binding of Rac1(GTP) to the liposomes. Complexes were not dissociated in the absence of GEF and GTP, and optimal dissociation required the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the liposomes. Dissociation of Rac1(GDP)·RhoGDI complexes was correlated with the affinity of particular GEF constructs, via the N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and involved GEF-mediated GDP to GTP exchange on Rac1. Phagocyte membranes enriched in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 responded by NADPH oxidase activation upon exposure in vitro to Rac1(GDP)·RhoGDI complexes, p67phox, GTP, and Rac GEF constructs with affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at a level superior to that of native membranes.

The separation between membrane-bound cytochrome b559 and the cytosolic components is a characteristic of the resting phagocyte. In response to stimuli acting via cell surface receptors, the cytosolic components become engaged in protein-protein and protein-membrane lipid interactions culminating in their translocation to the plasma membrane (PM).Oxidase assembly can be reproduced in vitro by mixing phagocyte membranes with the cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, and Rac and using an anionic amphiphile as activator (for a review, see Ref. 5Molshanski-Mor S.

Oxidase assembly can also be achieved in vitro in the absence of an activator in a system consisting of phagocyte membranes, p67phox, and Rac, even in the absence of p47phox, provided that Rac is in the prenylated form (6Gorzalczany Y.

Zhao T. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 1533-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that Rho proteins must associate with the PM to trigger a cellular response. A polybasic domain and an isoprenyl (geranylgeranyl) group, both at the C terminus, have been shown to play a critical role in anchoring Rac to the PM (8Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Koshkin V. Pick E. J.

Polyphosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol, collectively referred to as polyphosphoinositides (pPIs), which are transiently generated in the cytosolic leaflet of the PM upon phagocyte stimulation (for a review, see Ref. 12Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), are likely candidates for recruiting the prenylated C-terminal polybasic domain of Rac1 to the PM. Indeed it has been shown that Rac1 selectively interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and, to a lesser extent, with phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) (13Missy K.

This cycle is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins, which stimulate GTP loading and hydrolysis, respectively (for a review, see Ref. 15Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition, Rac cycles between cytosolic and membrane-associated forms through the association with and dissociation from the cytosolic regulatory proteins, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs) (for reviews, see Refs. 16Dovas A.

Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). The DH domain makes extensive contacts with the switch I and II regions of Rho GTPases and contains virtually all the residues required for substrate recognition, binding, and guanine nucleotide exchange (19Rossman K.L.

PH domains of many Dbl family members have been shown to direct membrane localization of their host proteins through binding to PM pPIs (23Lemmon M.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that the PH domain of Dbl binds to PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, and these interactions modulate the nucleotide exchange activity and subcellular localization of Dbl (24Russo C.

Mutational analysis of the GEF P-Rex1 demonstrated that recruitment to the PM of P-Rex1 mutants missing the PH domain, known to selectively bind to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, was severely impaired (25Barber M.A. Donald S.

Several groups of investigators provided evidence for the requirement of the N-terminal PH domain of Tiam1 for localization to the PM through its apparent binding preference for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (26Michiels F.

Very recently, the PH domain of the GEF Asef was shown to bind to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and target it to the PM (33Muroya K. Kawasaki Y. Hayashi T. Ohwada S. Akiyama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Dissociation of prenylated Rac from RhoGDI is an obligatory step in the assembly of the oxidase, preceding translocation of Rac from the cytosol to the PM (34Pick E.

A hydrophobic pocket, within the C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain of RhoGDI, regulates the partitioning of Rac between the cytosol and PM by binding the prenylated polybasic C terminus of Rac (for reviews, see Refs. 16Dovas A. Couchman J.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar and 17DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 356-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar).The mechanism(s) responsible for dissociation of Rho GTPases from RhoGDI in general and of Rac from RhoGDI in the context of oxidase assembly in particular remains largely unsolved. Several reports point to the possibility that biologically relevant anionic lipids might serve as RhoGDI displacement factors (for a review, see Ref. 17DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 356-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In an earlier publication, we demonstrated that Rac·RhoGDI complexes were dissociated by exposure to liposomes containing anionic but not neutral phospholipids, suggesting that the stability of Rac·RhoGDI complexes is regulated by the phospholipid composition of the phagocyte membrane with emphasis on the charge of phospholipids (37Ugolev Y. Molshanski-Mor S. Weinbaum C. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19204-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).A large body of evidence supports the idea that generation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the PM, upon cell stimulation, is functionally related to two events culminating in the formation of GTP-bound and membrane-anchored Rac: the dissociation of the Rac·RhoGDI complex and activation and translocation of a Rac GEF from the cytosol to the PM. In the present study, we set out to explore the relationship between these events by modifying the liposome-based system used earlier (37Ugolev Y. Molshanski-Mor S. Weinbaum C. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19204-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) by reducing the concentration of monovalent anionic phospholipid to that present in the membranes of resting phagocytes, supplementing the liposomes with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, and adding a Rac GEF and free GTP. We found the following. 1) Anionic liposomes enriched in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 combined with DH-PH tandem regions of Rac GEFs cooperatively promoted the dissociation of Rac·RhoGDI complexes. 2) The affinity of specific PH domains for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 determined the efficacy of Rac·RhoGDI dissociation by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-enriched liposomes and Rac GEF. 3) GDP to GTP exchange on Rac by GEFs occurred at the level of the liposomes and was critical for Rac·RhoGDI dissociation to become irreversible and be followed by binding of Rac(GTP) to the liposomes. 4) DH-PH tandems of Rac GEFs, with a binding preference for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, elicited oxidase activation in a cell-free system consisting of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-enriched phagocyte membranes, Rac1(GDP)·RhoGDI complexes, and GTP in the absence of an amphiphilic activator.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Reagents—The hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogue GMPPNP (tetralithium salt, 83%, <0.2% GTP) was purchased from Roche Applied Science.

The PCR product was digested with NdeI and SalI restriction enzymes and subcloned into a pET-30a vector (Novagen) to allow expression of His6-tagged Tiam1(C1199) in Escherichia coli. The DNA construct was verified by automated sequencing. Point mutations K452A, K453A, R459A, and R460A within the N-terminal PH (PHn) domain of Tiam1(C1199) (modified from Ref. 29Ceccarelli D.F.

Pick E. Cell. Immunol. 1984; 88: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Membranes, suspended to a concentration of 500 × 106 cell eq/ml, were first solubilized by 40 mm octyl glucoside and then reconstituted into liposomes by dialysis against detergent-free buffer as reported before (39Shpungin S.

Briefly DOPC and DOPS were dissolved at a concentration of 1 mm in the buffer also used for membrane solubilization containing 40 mm octyl glucoside. To facilitate solubilization, the phospholipids were first homogenized by using an ultrasonic processor (Vibra Cell, VCX 400 watts, Sonics and Materials) at 20% amplitude for three 10-s cycles in ice-cooled tubes. Next the mixtures were stirred magnetically in ice-cooled glass vials until a clear solution was obtained. All pPIs (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and PtdIns(4,5)P2) were also dissolved in the buffer used for membrane solubilization containing 40 mm octyl glucoside at a concentration of 100 μm. As before, the solutions were first subjected to homogenization in an ultrasonic processor at 60% amplitude for three 20min cycles in ice-cooled tubes. This was followed by gentle agitation for 3 h at 4 °C. Liposomes consisting of a mixture of DOPC and DOPS were prepared by mixing 1.48-ml aliquots of a 1 mm solution of DOPC with 0.32-ml aliquots of a 1 mm solution of DOPS and 0.20 ml of solubilization buffer, all containing 40 mm octyl glucoside. The final phospholipid concentrations in DOPC/DOPS liposomes were 0.74 mm DOPC (82.22 mol %) and 0.16 mm DOPS (17.77 mol %). Liposomes consisting of DOPC/DOPS/pPI were prepared by mixing 1.48-ml aliquots of a 1 mm solution of DOPC with 0.32-ml aliquots of a 1 mm solution of DOPS and 0.20-ml aliquots of a 100 μm solution of pPI. The final phospholipid concentrations in DOPC/DOPS/PtdIns liposomes were 0.74 mm DOPC (81.30 mol %), 0.16 mm DOPS (17.58 mol %), and 10 μm PtdIns (1.10 mol %). The mixtures were dialyzed against a 500-fold excess of detergent-free buffer using dialysis membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 25,000 (Spectrum Laboratories) for 18 h at 4 °C. On gel filtration on a Superose 12 10/300 GL fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) column (GE Healthcare), the vesicles elute in the exclusion volume (corresponding to an Mr of ≥2 × 106).Determination of Membrane Phospholipid Concentration—The concentration of total phospholipids in native macrophage membrane liposomes was measured as described in Ref. 42Stewart J.C.

The concentrations varied from 3.2 to 3.5 mm.Enrichment of Phagocyte Membranes in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3—The lipid composition of macrophage membranes was modified by mixing 1.35 ml of phagocyte membranes, solubilized by 40 mm octyl glucoside (at a concentration above 2100 pmol of cytochrome b559 heme/ml), with 0.15 ml of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (at a concentration of 100 μm) also dissolved in buffer containing 40 mm octyl glucoside. The mixtures were reconstituted into liposomes by dialysis against detergent-free buffer as described under “Preparation of Anionic Phospholipid Liposomes.” The final concentration of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the enriched phagocyte membranes was 10 μm, corresponding to 0.28-0.31 mol % in relation to total membrane phospholipids. The concentration of cytochrome b559 was measured after dialysis and was normally found to be close to 1900 pmol of heme/ml. The final concentration of cytochrome b559 heme of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-enriched membranes in cell-free oxidase activation assays was 5 nm, and the final concentration of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the assay was 25 nm.Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—Non-prenylated Rac1 and RhoGDI were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in E. coli BL21-Codon-Plus™ competent cells (Stratagene) and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) followed by cleavage by thrombin in situ as described in Ref. 44Mizrahi A.

Briefly pET-30a plasmids carrying cDNA of p67phox or Tiam1(C1199) either wild type or point mutant, pProEX HT plasmid carrying cDNA of Tiam1(C374), and pET15b plasmid carrying cDNA of TrioN were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3, pRIL)-CodonPlus™ cells. The bacteria were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C for 16 h. The induced cells were suspended in a buffer (buffer A), consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, supplemented with “Complete EDTA-free” protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The bacteria were disrupted by exposure to lysozyme (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for 20 min at 4 °C with stirring followed by sonication by a 500-watt sonic disruptor (Vibra Cell, Sonics and Materials) at 20% amplitude for 5 min in the 50% pulse mode in an ice-cooled beaker. The resulting material was supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and stirred on ice for 15 min. Insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, and the cleared cell-free extract was added to nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow Affinity Resin beads (GE Healthcare). Binding was performed in the batch mode at room temperature for 60 min. Following binding, the beads were washed twice with buffer A and twice with buffer A supplemented with 40 mm imidazole.

https://openalex.org/W1993195482,"One of the defining properties of β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) signaling is the transient and rapidly reversed accumulation of cAMP. Here we have investigated the contribution of different PDE4 proteins to the generation of this transient response. To this aim, mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in PDE4A, PDE4B, or PDE4D were generated, and the regulation of PDE activity, the accumulation of cAMP, and CREB phosphorylation in response to isoproterenol were monitored. Ablation of PDE4D, but not PDE4A or PDE4B, had a major effect on the β-agonist-induced PDE activation, with only a minimal increase in PDE activity being retained in PDE4D knock-out (KO) cells. Accumulation of cAMP was markedly enhanced, and the kinetics of cAMP accumulation were altered in their properties in PDE4DKO but not PDE4BKO cells. Modest effects were observed in PDE4AKO mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The return to basal levels of both cAMP accumulation and CREB phosphorylation was greatly delayed in the PDE4DKO cells, suggesting that PDE4D is critical for dissipation of the β2AR stimulus. This effect of PDE4D ablation was in large part due to inactivation of a negative feedback mechanism consisting of the PKA-mediated activation of PDE4D in response to elevated cAMP levels, as indicated by experiments using the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors H89 and PKI. Finally, PDE4D ablation affected the kinetics of β2AR desensitization as well as the interaction of the receptor with Gαi. These findings demonstrate that PDE4D plays a major role in shaping the β2AR signal.

By transducing the action of catecholamines into changes in intracellular cAMP levels, β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) 2The abbreviations used are:βARβ-adrenergic receptorANOVAanalysis of varianceCREBcAMP response element-binding proteinDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideErkextracellular signal-regulated kinaseGRKG protein-coupled receptor kinaseIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthineIPimmunoprecipitationISOisoproterenolKOknock-outMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastPDEphosphodiesterasePKAcAMP-stimulated protein kinasePKIPKA inhibitor peptidePTXpertussis toxinPBSphosphate-buffered salineRIAradioimmunoassayWTwild type. play a critical role in cellular homeostasis (1Xiao R.P.

Occupancy of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), the prototype G protein-coupled receptor, promotes GDP/GTP exchange in Gαs transducer proteins, which then activate adenylyl cyclases to synthesize cAMP. Although the interaction with Gαs is the primary outcome of receptor occupancy, β2AR also stimulates several other signaling cascades through interaction with Gαi and other effectors (3Zamah A.M.

Stimulation of cAMP accumulation by β2AR is usually transient because numerous feedback regulations are activated to finely tune the cAMP signal in intensity, time, and its propagation through the intracellular space. Occupancy of the β2AR causes rapid phosphorylation of the receptor by different kinases, with PKA- and GRK-mediated phosphorylation having been the most widely studied in terms of their effects. These phosphorylations directly modulate receptor coupling to G proteins but also constitute a signal for the recruitment of additional proteins involved in receptor signaling and trafficking of the receptor in and out of the plasma membrane (3Zamah A.M. Delahunty M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31249-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). At low concentrations of agonist, PKA phosphorylation of the unoccupied or occupied β2AR causes uncoupling from Gαs and heterologous desensitization, as documented by the reduced ability of the phosphorylated receptor to stimulate GDP/GTP exchange in Gαs (4Benovic J.L. Pike L.J. Cerione R.A. Staniszewski C. Yoshimasa T. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7094-7101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that β2AR phosphorylation at the PKA site promotes coupling to the inhibitory Gαi protein through several direct and indirect mechanisms (3Zamah A.M. Delahunty M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31249-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Indeed, regions of the third intracellular loop of β2AR have some affinity for Gαi, and the phosphorylated receptor shows increased affinity for Gαi in reconstitution systems (3Zamah A.M. Delahunty M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31249-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Benovic J.L. Pike L.J. Cerione R.A.

At higher concentrations of ligand, GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the occupied receptor increases the affinity of the receptor for the scaffold protein β-arrestin, which precludes the interaction with G proteins and promotes receptor internalization via binding to ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), dynamin, and clathrin-coated pits (5Drake M.T. Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The sequestration and trafficking of the receptor through these endocytic vesicles has several functions including resensitization of the receptor. These mechanisms are essential for cell signaling and homeostasis as documented by the phenotypes of β-arrestin null mice (3Zamah A.M. Delahunty M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31249-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6Conner D.A. Mathier M.A. Mortensen R.M. Christe M. Vatner S.F. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Circ.

A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the modulation of receptor-G protein interactions and receptor internalization, other mechanisms are likely to be involved in defining the β2AR signal in a cell. An emerging concept is that the properties of β-adrenergic signals are shaped by the presence of a large array of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (8Fischmeister R. Castro L.R. Abi-Gerges A. Rochais F. Jurevicius J. Leroy J. Vandecasteele G. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 816-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 9Mongillo M. Zaccolo M. Biochem. Soc.

These enzymes compose a superfamily of proteins that mediate cyclic nucleotide degradation. More than 20 genes are present in the mammalian genome and are subdivided into 11 PDE families on the basis of sequence homology, substrate specificity, and inhibitor sensitivity (10Conti M. Beavo J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 481-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). In addition, most PDE genes are expressed as multiple variants through the use of different promoters or alternative splicing, generating up to 100 individual PDE proteins, which implies a complex array of functions for these enzymes. PDE4s were initially identified pharmacologically by their sensitivity to the inhibitor rolipram. The four genes composing this family, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D, are widely expressed and are a major component of the cAMP degradation machinery in most cells (11Conti M. Richter W. Mehats C. Livera G. Park J.Y. Jin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5493-5496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Ablation of three of the four PDE4 genes (PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D) results in numerous phenotypes, underscoring the importance of these enzymes in cell homeostasis (12Jin S.-L. C. Richter W. Conti M. Beavo J. Francis S. Houslay M. Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases in Health and Disease. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2007: 323-346Google Scholar). PDE4s share the property of being rapidly phosphorylated and activated by PKA as part of a negative feedback loop regulating cAMP levels during hormone action (11Conti M. Richter W. Mehats C. Livera G. Park J.Y. Jin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5493-5496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The function of this regulation has been addressed indirectly by pharmacological manipulation (13Oki N. Takahashi S.I. Hidaka H. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10831-10837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but no information is available on how a cell responds to β2AR agonists in the absence of this feedback loop. The impact of this regulation has been explored in the present study using a genetic approach. In line with the idea that PDEs contribute to the compartmentalization of signaling, many PDEs show unique subcellular distributions due to the formation of protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions (11Conti M. Richter W. Mehats C. Livera G. Park J.Y. Jin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5493-5496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 14Houslay M.D. Adams D.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Most of the PDEs form complexes with components of cAMP signaling distal to the receptor, such as the formation of complexes with PKA through binding to A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (15Dodge K.L. Khouangsathiene S. Kapiloff M.S. Mouton R. Hill E.V. Houslay M.D. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 16Tasken K.A. Collas P.

However, others become associated with the G protein-coupled receptors themselves (17Baillie G.S. Sood A. McPhee I. Gall I. Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Houslay M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 18Perry S.J. Baillie G.S. Kohout T.A. McPhee I. Magiera M.M. Ang K.L. Miller W.E. McLean A.J. Conti M. Houslay M.D. Lefkowitz R.J.

Kobilka B. Conti M. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). PDE4s have been shown to regulate several aspects of β2AR and cAMP signaling by being recruited to the receptor in association with β-arrestin. PDE4 recruitment has important effects on the properties of the signal emanating from the receptor as indicated by its effects on PKA activity (18Perry S.J. Baillie G.S. Kohout T.A. McPhee I. Magiera M.M. Ang K.L. Miller W.E. McLean A.J. Conti M. Houslay M.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been proposed that PDE4D recruitment to the receptor in complex with β-arrestin serves to negatively modulate the β2AR “switch” from Gαs signaling to Gαi-mediated responses (17Baillie G.S. Sood A. McPhee I. Gall I. Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Houslay M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). According to this view, β2AR occupancy causes local activation of PKA, which in turn phosphorylates the receptor. This phosphorylation promotes the switch in β2AR coupling from Gαs to Gαi and then activation of other kinases, such as the tyrosine kinase Src, as well as other pathways such as Raf/Erk. It has been reported that PDE4D down-regulation with small interfering RNAs or overexpression of an inactive PDE4D functioning as a dominant negative causes enhanced phosphorylation of the β2AR as well as increased activation of Erk; both events are consistent with an increased switching from Gαs to Gαi. However, the regulations occurring after receptor occupancy may be even more complex, because it has recently been proposed that some of the events linking Erk and β2AR are independent of PKA activation but dependent on β-arrestin recruitment (20Shenoy S.K. Drake M.T. Nelson C.D. Houtz D.A. Xiao K. Madabushi S. Reiter E. Premont R.T. Lichtarge O. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1261-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the role of different PDE4 subtypes in β2AR signaling using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in single PDE4 genes. This approach allows us to monitor the effects of PDE4 ablation on the endogenous β2AR without overexpression of receptors or PDEs. Our data demonstrate that PKA-mediated phosphorylation and activation of PDE4D is a major determinant in the control of cAMP accumulation after β2AR stimulation. PDE4D, but not PDE4A or PDE4B, is also involved in defining the time course of β2AR uncoupling and desensitization. Surprisingly, we found that PDE4D ablation disrupts desensitization and β2AR coupling to Gαi rather than enhancing it. Materials—Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (catalog No. 11965), fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin stock solution, 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, and l-glutamine were obtained from Invitrogen.

The PKA inhibitor H89 (N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)-ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride) was from Calbiochem. Generation of MEF Cell Lines—The generation of mice deficient in PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D has been described previously (21Jin S.L. Conti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7628-7633Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 22Jin S.L. Lan L. Zoudilova M. Conti M. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23Jin S.L.

For the present study, the PDE4 null alleles were transferred to a pure C57Bl/6 background by backcrossing heterozygous mice of mixed C57Bl/6-129/Ola background over 13 generations. To derive MEF cells, embryos were retrieved from pregnant females 13.5 days post-coitum. The brain and internal organs of the embryos were removed, and the remaining carcasses were minced and incubated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. Complete medium (consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm l-glutamine, 30 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) was added to the cell suspensions, and cells were disaggregated by up-and-down pipetting. Large tissue clumps, which settled to the bottom of the tube during a 1-min incubation at room temperature, were removed. The remaining cell suspensions were then transferred onto cell culture dishes. Fibroblasts were grown at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere to confluence. Cells were replated, grown to 80–90% confluence, and then harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen at 4 × 106 cells/ml in complete medium supplemented with 10% DMSO and 15% fetal bovine serum. Cell Culture and Harvest—For experiments, 1-ml aliquots of MEFs were thawed, and cells were grown on 10-cm cell culture plates to 80–90% confluence. The cells were then replated into 6-well culture dishes at a density of 2 × 10 5 cells/well. After overnight culture, cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5 mm l-glutamine, 30 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 mm HEPES for 16 h before cell treatment and harvest. Cells were pretreated for 5 min with rolipram (10 μm), IBMX (1 mm) or H89 (10 μm) as indicated and were then stimulated with isoproterenol (ISO, 10 μm) for different times while cell culture plates were resting in a 37 °C water bath. For restimulation experiments (Fig. 11) cells were washed four times with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) between treatments. For measurement of PDE activity, MEFs were lysed in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 100 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 nm okadaic acid, and complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Diagnostics). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g, and supernatants were either used directly for PDE assay or first subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) as described below. Measurement of cAMP Accumulation—After the appropriate treatment, the cell culture medium was aspirated and the reactions terminated by addition of 0.8 ml of 95% ice-cold ethanol containing 0.1% trichloroacetic acid to each well. After a 30-min incubation of the plates on ice, the trichloroacetic acid solution containing cAMP was collected. The cell protein that remained on the cell culture plates was dissolved in 300 μl of 1 n NaOH/well, and this solution was used for determination of protein content as described below. The cAMP-containing trichloroacetic acid solutions were dried in a spin vacuum and reconstituted in 500 μl of PBS, and cAMP concentrations were determined using a radioimmunoassay (RIA) as described previously (24Harper J.F. Brooker G. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1975; 1: 207-218PubMed Google Scholar). PDE Assay—PDE activity was measured according to the method of Thompson and Appleman (25Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and as described in detail previously (26Richter W. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40212-40221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In brief, samples were assayed in a reaction mixture of 200 μl (containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm cAMP, 0.75 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 μCi of [3H]cAMP) for 30 min at 33 °C. The reaction was terminated by heat inactivation in a boiling water bath for 1 min. The PDE reaction product 5′-AMP was then hydrolyzed by incubating the assay mixture with 50 μgof C. atrox snake venom for 20 min at 33 °C, and the resulting adenosine was separated by anion exchange chromatography using 1 ml of AG1-X8 resin (Bio-Rad) and quantitated by scintillation counting. Antibodies and IP—Rabbit anti-PDE4D3, anti-PDE4D5, anti-PDE4D9, PAN-PDE4A (AC55), and PAN-PDE4B (K118) antibodies, as well as the mouse PAN-PDE4D (M3S1) antibody, have been described previously (27Richter W. Jin S.L. Conti M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, these antibodies were coupled to 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose and incubated with the respective cell extracts for 2 h at 4 °C, after which pellets were washed three times with cell lysis buffer and the resulting IP pellets subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting or used for measurement of PDE activity as described above. Design of a PDE4D Adenoviral Vector—Cloning of the open reading frame of the rat PDE4D variants PDE4D2, PDE4D5, and PDE4D9 has been described previously (19Richter W. Day P. Agrawal R. Bruss M.D. Granier S. Wang Y.L. Rasmussen S.G. Horner K. Wang P. Lei T. Patterson A.J. Kobilka B. Conti M. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Richter W. Jin S.L. Conti M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the present study, these constructs were subcloned into the pAd/CMV/V5-DEST vector to generate an adenovirus encoding a C-terminally Myc-tagged PDE4D5 using the ViraPower adenoviral expression system (Invitrogen). Protein Assay—Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Data Analysis—Experimental data of cAMP accumulation were fitted using single or double exponential decay equations using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was determined with Student’s t test or ANOVA, as indicated, using the Prism software. Generation of MEFs Deficient in Different PDE4 Subtypes—MEFs deficient in the PDE4 subtypes, PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D, were generated by mating heterozygous PDE4 mice on a pure C57Bl/6 background. Wild type and homozygous PDE4KO cells were derived from embryos of the same pregnancy; thus, PDE4KO and wild type MEFs are considered congenic except for the targeted locus. Indeed, cells of the same genotype prepared from different embryos produced comparable results. In the same vein, wild type cells from the different PDE4 knock-out lines behaved in a similar fashion. Thus, data from different wild type lines were pooled. In all experiments performed, cells were used within four passages. At these early passages, these MEFs express β-adrenergic receptors at levels sufficient to produce a 20-fold increase in cAMP concentration after a 2-min exposure to 10 μm ISO (see for instance supplemental Fig. 1). The β2AR is the predominant β-adrenergic receptor subtype expressed in MEFs, as cAMP elevation in response to ISO is blocked by a β2AR antagonist (ICI118551) but not by a β1AR antagonist (CGP20712A) (supplemental Fig. 1). PDE Expression Pattern in MEFs—To define the repertoire of PDEs present in MEFs, PDE activity assays were performed on cell extracts in the presence of specific PDE inhibitors or after IP with PDE4 subtype-selective antibodies. PDE4 and PDE3 are the major PDE families expressed in these cells, contributing ∼60 and 30% of the total PDE activity, respectively (Fig. 1A). Of the four PDE4 genes present in the mouse genome, PDE4D is the major form expressed in these MEFs, accounting for about 25% of the overall PDE activity, whereas PDE4A and PDE4B each account for ∼10–15% of the activity (Fig. 1B). To date, at least nine different PDE4D variants (PDE4D1–PDE4D9) have been described. The PDE activity immunoprecipitated with PDE4D5 and PDE4D9 antibodies (Fig. 1C) accounted for the PDE4D activity expressed in these MEFs (Fig. 1B), indicating that PDE4D5 and −9 are the major, if not the only, PDE4D variants expressed. PDE4D3 and PDE4D8 are expressed at low levels (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis of MEF extracts using a PAN-PDE4D antibody (Fig. 1C) revealed a predominant band migrating at ∼90 kDa, corresponding to variants PDE4D3, −8, and −9, and a weaker band at ∼100 kDa, corresponding to the migration of PDE4D5 and −7 (27Richter W. Jin S.L. Conti M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, this PDE4D immunoreactive pattern is consistent with the predominant expression of PDE4D9 and lower expression level of PDE4D5 as determined by IP in Fig. 1C. To confirm the identity of the PDEs expressed in MEFs and to determine whether compensation occurs after individual PDE4 gene ablation, the activity of PDE4 subtypes was measured in PDE4KO and matching wild type MEFs. The activity corresponding to the disrupted gene in each of the PDE4KO cell lines could not be detected. Other than the loss of the activity corresponding to the ablated gene, the knock-out MEFs displayed a similar PDE4 activity pattern compared with that of their matched wild type cells, indicating that compensatory up-regulation of the remaining PDE4 genes does not occur (Fig. 2). β2AR-dependent Activation of PDE4 in MEFs—Elevated cAMP levels resulting from β2AR stimulation promote the PKA-mediated phosphorylation and activation of PDE4, a ubiquitous negative feedback loop involved in cAMP homeostasis (11Conti M.

To define which PDE4 subtypes are activated upon β-adrenergic signaling in MEFs, PDE activity was monitored at different times after treatment with ISO (Fig. 3A). Wild type MEFs displayed a rapid, ISO-dependent PDE4 activation, with an approximate 2-fold increase over basal activity within the first 30 s of stimulation, a time course overlapping that reported for β2AR phosphorylation (30Roth N.S.

Moore R.H. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). PDE4 activity continued to increase up until 5 min, reaching a plateau at about 2.5 times the basal activity. In contrast, in MEFs deficient in PDE4D only a small response to ISO stimulation could be detected (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this finding, immunoprecipitated PDE4D activity increased significantly in response to a 5-min ISO treatment (Fig. 3B). PDE4A activity was also elevated, whereas PDE4B activity did not change in response to ISO. Both the PDE4D variants PDE4D5 and −9 contributed to the ISO-dependent increase in PDE4D activity in wild type MEFs (Fig. 3B). The activity of PDEs other than PDE4 was not affected by ISO treatment (data not shown). Thus, together with a moderate overall decrease in basal PDE activity, PDE4DKO cells display minimal PDE activation upon ISO treatment. Global cAMP Accumulation in Cells Deficient in the Different PDE4 Subtypes—To determine the effects of PDE4 subtype ablation on cAMP signaling, cAMP accumulation in response to ISO was followed for up to 10 min (Fig. 4). Exposure to ISO rapidly stimulated cAMP accumulation in wild type MEFs, with a transient maximum reached at 1 min (see Fig. 4B) and cAMP levels rapidly declining thereafter. PDE4B inactivation produced no changes in cAMP accumulation, whereas a small but significant increase in cAMP accumulation was observed in PDE4AKO MEFs (Fig. 4A). Conversely, PDE4D ablation had dramatic effects. The time course of β2AR-dependent cAMP accumulation in PDE4DKO MEFs was altered in three distinct properties. The maximal cAMP accumulated was increased (cAMPmax WT = 255 ± 56; cAMPmax PDE4DKO = 900 ± 130 pmol/mg protein), and the half-time required to reach the maximum (tmax½) was delayed (30Roth N.S.

https://openalex.org/W2031104644,"The mechanism regulating radiation-induced anti-apoptotic response, a limiting factor in improving cell radiosensitivity, remains elusive. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase (MKP)-1 is the major member of MKPs that dephosphorylates and inactivates MAPK. Here we provide the evidence that MKP-1 was negatively bridging between NF-kappaB-mediated prosurvival pathway and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated proapoptotic response. MKP-1 was induced by gamma-radiation and repressed radiation-induced pro-apoptotic status. NF-kappaB RelA/p50 heterodimer was recruited to MKP-1 gene promoter to induce MKP-1 transcription. Deletion of the NF-kappaB-binding site or inactivation of NF-kappaB by its small interfering RNA significantly decreased the radiation-induced MKP-1 promoter activity. In addition, MKP-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibited a prolonged activation of JNK but not p38 or extracellular signal-regulated kinase subfamilies of MAPKs. The prolonged activation of JNK was not induced by treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha or interleukin-6, and inactivation of JNK but not p38 or ERK abolished radiation-induced proapoptotic status, indicating that JNK is specifically inhibited by radiation-induced MKP-1. Three MKP-1 wild type human tumor cell lines treated with MKP-1 small interfering RNA showed an increased proapoptotic response that can be rescued by overexpression of wild type mouse MKP-1. Together, these results suggest that MKP-1 is a NF-kappaB-mediated prosurvival effector in attenuating JNK-mediated pro-apoptotic response; NF-kappaB/MKP-1-mediated negative JNK regulation represents a potential therapeutic target for adjusting cell radiosensitivity."

In hepatocytes and enterocytes, cholesteryl esters are secreted as part of apoB lipoproteins, the assembly of which is critically dependent on microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). Conditional genetic ablation of MTP reduces cholesteryl esters and enhances free cholesterol in the liver and intestine without diminishing ACAT1 and ACAT2 mRNA levels. As expected, increases in hepatic free cholesterol are associated with decreases in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and increases in ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 mRNA levels. Chemical inhibition of MTP also decreases esterification of cholesterol in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells. Conversely, coexpression of MTP and apoB in AC29 cells stably transfected with ACAT1 and ACAT2 increases cholesteryl ester synthesis. Liver and enterocyte microsomes from MTP-deficient animals synthesize lesser amounts of cholesteryl esters in vitro, but addition of purified MTP and low density lipoprotein corrects this deficiency. Enrichment of microsomes with cholesteryl esters also inhibits cholesterol ester synthesis. Thus, MTP enhances cellular cholesterol esterification by removing cholesteryl esters from their site of synthesis and depositing them into nascent apoB lipoproteins. Therefore, MTP plays a novel role in regulating cholesteryl ester biosynthesis in cells that produce lipoproteins.

All animals had free access to water and standard laboratory chow. To induce mttp gene deletion, mice were injected (200 μl) three times intraperitoneally with 500 μg of poly(I:C) on alternate days. Control mice received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injections. Food was withdrawn 16 h before the mice were killed. On the day of the experiment, mice were anesthetized, and blood was collected from the heart. Liver and proximal intestine segments (∼2–3 cm) were collected, washed with ice-cold PBS, cut into small pieces, and used for lipid extraction or measurement of different protein activities.

(43Cheema S.K. Cikaluk D. Agellon L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 315-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, liver pieces (50–100 mg), jejunal segments (1–2 cm), or enterocytes prepared from the whole jejunum were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m K2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KF, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol using a 2-ml capacity Potter-Elvehjem glass-Teflon homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove cell debris, and the supernatants were recentrifuged for 120 min at 50,000 rpm in an SW55 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 4 °C. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer, and several aliquots were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until assayed. ACAT activity assays using purified microsomes were performed by the method of Erickson et al. (44Erickson S.K. Shrewsbury M.A. Brooks C. Meyer D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 930-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the incorporation of palmitoyl-CoA into cholesteryl esters was determined using 100 μg of microsomal protein and [3H]cholesterol (0.2 μCi, 40–60 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in an ACAT assay buffer of 0.25 m sucrose, 100 mm Tris-HCl, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) in a final volume of 200 μl. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the activity was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1). Lipids were extracted from the reaction mixture by the method of Bligh and Dyer (40Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) and separated by TLC. Bands corresponding to free and esterified cholesterol were quantified by scintillation counting. In some experiments, incorporation of [14C]palmitoyl-CoA (0.1 μCi, 40–60 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) into cholesteryl esters was determined using 100 μg of microsomal protein and 20 μg of exogenous cholesterol or 50 nmol of free cholesterol in cyclodextran (45Rudel L.L. Davis M. Sawyer J. Shah R. Wallace J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31401-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At the end of the reaction, lipids were extracted and separated by TLC, and the amounts of the radioactivity in cholesteryl esters were quantified using a PhosphorImager. Product inhibition of ACAT enzyme was studied by incubating palmitoyl-CoA with 100 μg of microsomal protein, [3H]cholesterol, and increasing concentrations of cholesteryl palmitate. Cholesteryl palmitate was prepared by dissolving 62.5 mg of cholesteryl palmitate in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1), evaporating the solvent under nitrogen, suspending the powder in 10 ml of ACAT assay buffer, and sonicating for 30 min on ice using a Model 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher) set at speed 3. After sonication, cholesterol levels were measured in the suspension and diluted to obtain a final concentration of 1 mm. The sonication resulted in very small amounts of cholesterol esters suspended in buffer, and we did not check for stability of the preparation. These suspensions were used immediately with no further characterization. In some experiments, enrichment of microsomes with cholesteryl esters was achieved by incubating 100 mg of microsomal protein with increasing concentrations of cholesteryl palmitate suspension for 30 min in a total volume of 1 ml of ACAT assay buffer. After incubation, microsomes were washed and repelleted for 120 min at 50,000 rpm in an SW55 rotor at 4 °C. Microsomes were resuspended in 1 ml of ACAT assay buffer, and 100 μl was used to extract lipids. Total cholesterol was measured in the lipid extracts with a cholesterol kit. Aliquots of the enriched microsomes (100 μg of protein, ∼1.2 μl) were also used to measure ACAT activity in the presence or absence of MTP and/or LDL (1 μg of protein/reaction). mRNA Quantification and Primers—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol™ (Invitrogen). The purity and integrity of RNA were assessed by the A260/A280 ratio and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. Only RNAs with ratios of >1.7 were used for cDNA synthesis. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using an Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen Inc.). Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA, 1 μm random primers (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm dNTP solution, and 0.5 units/μl Omniscript reverse transcriptase were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 20 μl of reverse transcription buffer, and the reaction was terminated by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. Each quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed in 20 μl consisting of 5 μl of cDNA sample (1:100 dilution of the first strand cDNA sample) and 15 μl of PCR Master Mix solution containing 1× PCR buffer, 6 mm MgCl2, 200 nm primer pair, 0.025 units/μl HotStar Gold™ DNA polymerase, 200 μm dNTP solution, and 0.3 μl SYBR Green I solution (qPCR™ core kit for SYBR Green I, Eurogentec). PCR was performed by incubating the reaction mixture first for 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15-s incubations at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems).

In some experiments, different concentrations of the MTP inhibitor BMS197636 or the ACAT inhibitor 148817 in dimethyl sulfoxide were added to the apical side to study their effects on cholesteryl esterification either alone or in combination. Dimethyl sulfoxide levels were ≤0.1%. The basolateral medium was collected and used to measure apoB and apoAI as described previously (50Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z.

After 2 days, cells were labeled with [3H]cholesterol for 6 h in 10% FBS and chased in serum-free medium containing OA (0.2 mm)·BSA (0.5%, w/v) complexes in the absence or presence of either the MTP inhibitor BMS197636 (1 μm) or the ACAT inhibitor 148817 (1 μm) for 17 h. Lipids were extracted and used to quantify cholesteryl esters. Overexpression of ApoB and MTP in Different Cell Lines—Undifferentiated Caco-2 cells were treated with trypsin and seeded in 6-well plates (400,000 cells/well). Transfections with human MTP expression plasmids (5 μg/well) were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

First, cells were transfected with human MTP expression plasmids (1.5 μg/flask) using FuGENE 6 in T175 flasks (7.2 × 106 cells). After 8 h, cells were detached by trypsin treatment, seeded in 6-well plates, and transfected with different apoB expression plasmids (1.0 μg/well).

Following an additional 18 h of incubation, the medium was collected; protease inhibitors (Sigma) were added; the samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet cell debris; and the apoB contents were measured in the supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (50Hussain M.M.

Translocation of most TTS effectors requires binding by specific chaperones in the bacterial cytosol, although how chaperones promote translocation is unclear. To provide insight into the action of such chaperones, we studied the consequences of binding by the Yersinia chaperone SycE to the effector YopE by NMR. These studies examined the intact form of the effector, whereas prior studies have been limited to well ordered fragments. We found that YopE had the characteristics of a natively unfolded protein, with its N-terminal 100 residues, including its chaperone-binding (Cb) region, flexible and disordered in the absence of SycE. SycE binding caused a pronounced disorder-to-order transition in the Cb region of YopE. The effect of SycE was strictly localized to the Cb region, with other portions of YopE being unperturbed. These results provide stringent limits on models of chaperone action and are consistent with the chaperone promoting formation of a three-dimensional targeting signal in the Cb region of the effector. The target of this putative signal is unknown but appears to be a bacterial component other than the TTS ATPase YscN.

Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 811-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar).

A large family of such chaperones exists, with individual chaperones functioning in the translocation of only a single or just a few corresponding effectors.

Chaperone dimers provide rigid and globular surfaces, around which effectors wrap an ∼25–100-residue chaperone-binding (Cb) region in strikingly extended conformation (4Stebbins C.E. Galan J.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 6Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol.

Cell. 2006; 21: 653-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This conformation is generally similar among effectors despite lack of obvious sequence homology. Two models have been proposed to explain the role of the extended conformation of the effector Cb region. In the first, the extended conformation is considered to maintain or prime unfolding of the effector (4Stebbins C.E. Galan J.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) for transport through the narrow ∼20–30 Å diameter bore of the TTS needle (14Blocker A. Jouihri N. Larquet E. Gounon P. Ebel F. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. Allaoui A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 652-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In the second, the extended conformation is suggested to form a discrete three-dimensional signal targeting the chaperone-effector complex to a TTS component required for translocation (6Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recent results demonstrating binding between a Salmonella chaperone-effector complex and the TTS ATPase as well as ATP hydrolysis-dependent unfolding of the effector by the ATPase are consistent with both unfolding and targeting models (15Akeda Y. Galan J.E. Nature. 2005; 437: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To provide further insight into mechanisms of chaperone action, we investigated the structural and dynamic changes an intact effector undergoes upon chaperone binding. Prior studies have been incomplete, being limited to crystallographic studies of structured portions of protein fragments. This has been due to the aggregation-prone nature of free intact effectors and the intractability of intact chaperone-effector complexes to crystallization. To circumvent these issues, we devised methods for obtaining free intact YopE, a well studied Yersinia pseudotuberculosis effector, and intact SycE-YopE chaperone-effector complexes at concentrations and conditions suitable for NMR spectroscopy. In common with other effectors, YopE requires not only the Cb region (residues 23–78) for translocation (16Sory M.P. Boland A. Lambermont I. Cornelis G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11998-12002Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) but also a second discrete region, termed here signal 1 (S1) (Fig. 1A). Although one line of evidence indicates that S1 is composed of the N-terminal ∼15 amino acids of YopE (17Lloyd S.A. Norman M. Rosqvist R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), other results indicate it is composed of the first ∼15 mRNA codons of YopE (18Ramamurthi K.S. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These possibilities are not exclusive, and indeed ribonucleic and proteinaceous signals may be important at different times after host cell contact (2Ghosh P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 771-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Following the S1 and Cb regions in effectors are host cell interaction domains, which in YopE consist of a single functionality. Residues 100–219 of YopE have RhoGAP activity (Fig. 1A) (19Von Pawel-Rammingen U. Telepnev M.V. Schmidt G. Aktories K. Wolf-Watz H. Rosqvist R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), which is required for disrupting host cell actin and antagonizing phagocytic uptake of Y. pseudotuberculosis by macrophages. The studies reported here revealed that the N-terminal 100 residues of YopE, including the S1 and Cb regions, were disordered and flexible in the absence of bound SycE, as is characteristic of natively unfolded proteins. SycE binding brought about a pronounced disorder-to-order transition in the Cb region but had no effect on other portions of YopE. These results provide support for a targeting model of chaperone action and are inconsistent with unfolding models. No association between SycE-YopE and the Yersinia TTS ATPase YscN was detected, suggesting that the target of the putative signal in the SycE-YopE complex is a Yersinia component other than YscN. Protein Expression and Purification—His-tagged SycE-YopE complexes were prepared as described previously (6Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), except as follows. For production of 15N-labeled, 13C-labeled, or dually labeled SycE-YopE, bacteria were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase in minimal medium containing 15N-labeled (NH4)2SO4 (1 g/liter), [13C] glucose (2 g/liter), or both; induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; and grown for 18 h at 25 °C. For production of triple labeled (2H,15N,13C) SycE-YopE, bacteria were grown in 2X-YT medium at 37 °C to mid-log phase, at which point bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), washed twice in M9 salts, and resuspended in a 0.25 volume of minimal medium containing D2O, 15N-labeled (NH4)2SO4, and [13C] glucose. Bacteria were then grown for 20 h at 25 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 5 mm imidazole, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 μg/ml DNase). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and SycE-YopE was applied to a Ni2+ chelation column and eluted using a 5–500 mm imidazole gradient in lysis buffer. The eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration (30-kDa molecular weight cut off), and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75) in 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The YopE(RhoGAP) fragment (residues 81–219), containing a C-terminal His tag (LEHHHHHH), was expressed using pET28b (Novagen) and produced with isotopic labeling and purified as above. A biotinylated version of SycE-YopE, with YopE containing a C-terminal 21-residue biotinylation sequence (KLPAGGGLNDIFEAQKIEWHE), was expressed using pAC-6 in Escherichia coli AVB101 cells (Avidity). In vivo biotinylated SycE-YopE was purified as described previously (6Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), except that precipitation was carried out with 50% (NH4)2SO4, and the protein was dialyzed in Tris buffer, pH 8. Denaturation and Renaturation—SycE-YopE was denatured in 8 m urea and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads. Denatured YopE was eluted from these beads with 8 m urea, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.0, and renatured by dilution in 1 m arginine, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA at a final concentration of 1 μm (determined by A280). For renaturation of SycE-YopE complexes, a 2-fold molar excess of denatured, unlabeled SycE was included with YopE. SycE was isolated from the unbound fraction of unlabeled, denatured SycE-YopE applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads or purified in its native form as described previously (3Birtalan S. Ghosh P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Renaturation solutions containing YopE alone or YopE mixed with SycE were stirred vigorously for a minimum of 1 h at 4 °C and then dialyzed in 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA. Renatured and aggregated proteins were separated by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.1. NMR Data Collection—NMR spectra for SycE-YopE, free YopE, and YopE(RhoGAP) were typically measured at protein concentrations of 15–60, 2–4, and 45 mg/ml, respectively. Samples for NMR analysis were prepared in 45 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.1 (95% H2O, 5% D2O), and all NMR spectra were collected at 298 K and 700-MHz 1H frequency on a Bruker Avance spectrometer with a cryoprobe. Sequential assignment was analyzed with the program CARA (20Keller R. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial. CANTINA Verlag, Goldau, Switzerland2004Google Scholar), and stretches of sequentially connected spin systems were mapped to the amino acid sequence of YopE with the program MAPPER (21Guntert P. Salzmann M. Braun D. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For free YopE, all but four of 191 resonances were assigned, and for SycE-YopE, all but 25 resonances were assigned, of which about half are from the RhoGAP domain. ΔδAv represents √((Δ1H)2 + 0.2(Δ15N)2)/2. Binding Experiments with Biotinylated SycE-YopE and YopE— Biotinylated SycE-YopE (650 μg) was incubated with 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads for 1 h at 25 °C in 500 μl of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and beads were washed three times with 700 μl of binding buffer. A portion of the streptavidin-agarose beads containing SycE-YopE was washed 15 times with 700 μl of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.8, to remove SycE. YopE remaining on beads was renatured by washing five times with binding buffer. This procedure completely removed SycE and resulted in only slight loss of YopE, as assayed by Western blotting and silver staining. Lysates were prepared from Y. pseudotuberculosis 126 and Y. pseudotuberculosis 126(ΔyopE). This latter strain was generated through standard allelic exchange procedures, with the coding region for yopE being replaced by the coding region for kanR. 3L. Rodgers and S. Birtalan, manuscript in preparation. Wild-type and ΔyopE Y. pseudotuberculosis were grown in BHI medium at 37 °C until mid-log density, and type III secretion was induced by addition of sodium oxalate and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 20 mm. After 3 h, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 25 ml of binding buffer (supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mm E-64) per liter of bacterial culture, and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and endogenous biotinylated proteins were removed by incubation with 400 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation (3,500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Lysates (∼333 μl) from wild-type Y. pseudotuberculosis cultures (∼8 ml) were added to 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads containing bound SycE-YopE; lysates from the ΔyopE strain were added to streptavidin-agarose beads containing only bound YopE. Resulting slurries were rocked for 95 min at 4 °C and washed three times for wild-type lysate and 30 times for ΔyopE lysate with 700 μl of binding buffer. Bound proteins were removed from beads by boiling in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were probed with anti-YscN (gift of O. Schneewind) (22Blaylock B. Riordan K.E. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3525-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or anti-SycE rabbit polyclonal antibodies, for which binding was visualized using horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-SycE antibodies were produced in rabbits by standard means using purified SycE as an antigen (Antibodies Inc.). Renaturation of Free and SycE-bound YopE for NMR Studies— To carry out NMR characterization of the 52-kDa SycE-YopE complex, selectively labeled SycE-YopE complexes were prepared by a denaturation-renaturation protocol. Such complexes contained unlabeled SycE and isotopically labeled (with 15N, 13C, 2H, or a combination of these) YopE. For this procedure, biosynthetically labeled SycE-YopE complexes were recombinantly expressed and purified. Labeled YopE (23 kDa) was dissociated from labeled dimeric SycE (29 kDa/dimer) by urea-induced denaturation and then renatured with unlabeled SycE in a non-chaotropic buffer to produce selectively labeled SycE-YopE. Free YopE was generated similarly, except that SycE was omitted during renaturation. Renatured SycE-YopE was verified to have circular dichroism spectra and gel filtration chromatography profiles indistinguishable from those of catalytically active complexes isolated in its native form (i.e. without denaturation; data not shown) (6Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, NMR analysis provided the most precise verification for renatured SycE-YopE and free YopE. 15N-1H transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) spectra of renatured YopE and SycE-YopE (supplemental Fig. S1) were acquired and compared with that of YopE(RhoGAP), a truncated form of YopE. This truncated form contains only the RhoGAP domain (residues 81–219) and was isolated in its native form (i.e. without denaturation steps). A similar fragment (residues 90–219) was crystallized and demonstrated to have RhoGAP catalytic activity (19Von Pawel-Rammingen U. Telepnev M.V. Schmidt G. Aktories K. Wolf-Watz H. Rosqvist R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Routzahn K.M. Waugh D.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Without exception, all 147 cross-peaks in the 15N-1H TROSY spectrum of YopE(RhoGAP) superimposed with cross-peaks in the spectrum of renatured YopE as well as that of SycE-YopE. This complete superimposition indicated that renatured YopE and SycE-YopE had properly folded conformations in their RhoGAP domains and were suitable for structural analysis. No Effect of SycE Binding on the YopE RhoGAP Domain—15N-1H TROSY spectra of YopE and SycE-YopE were compared to evaluate the effects of SycE binding on YopE. We observed 191 cross-peaks for the 15N-1H moieties of free YopE and 244 for SycE-bound YopE (Fig. 1B). The 244 YopE resonances in SycE-YopE were in excess of the 214 resonances expected (including a His tag, see “Experimental Procedures”), suggesting the existence of multiple conformations and possibly the incomplete suppression of side chain resonances. More importantly, the great majority of free YopE resonances (151 of 191) overlapped (<0.1 ppm change) with SycE-YopE resonances (Fig. 1B), which indicated that SycE binding had a limited effect on YopE. The 40 YopE resonances that had no counterparts in the SycE-YopE spectrum (i.e. those shifted upon SycE binding) were also notably absent in the spectrum of the YopE(RhoGAP) fragment. This indicated that SycE exerted its effect within the N-terminal 80 residues of YopE and had no effect on the RhoGAP domain. Localized Effect of SycE on YopE—To characterize the effects of SycE on YopE at the resolution of individual residues, we assigned cross-peaks in 15N-1H TROSY spectra to corresponding residues. We acquired sequential backbone assignments for 2H,13C,15N-labeled YopE in its free or SycE-bound states using three-dimensional TROSY-HNCA, TROSY-HNCACB, and 15N-resolved [1H,1H] NOE spectroscopy (with a 100-ms mixing time) for the collection of 1HN-1HN NOEs (24Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 25Salzmann M. Pervushin K. Wider G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Salzmann M. Wider G. Pervushin K. Senn H. Wuthrich K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 844-848Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 27Xia Y. Sze K. Zhu G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For free YopE, 91% of possible assignments were made. Residues lacking assignments were Met1 and Lys2 in S1; Leu55–Arg58, Arg62–Ile71, Phe73, Ile74, and Phe78 in Cb; and Gln149 in the RhoGAP domain. These gaps in the Cb region were likely due to overlapping resonances. For SycE-bound YopE, 95% of possible assignments were made. Residues lacking assignments were Met1 and Lys2 in S1; Ser36, Asn41, Leu43, Ser64, Ser69, Phe73, and Arg76 in the Cb region; and Gln149 in the RhoGAP domain. The assignment process for SycE-YopE was complicated by the fact that ∼25% of residues in the Cb region showed duplicated chemical shifts, and several residues in this region showed very weak peak intensities, in particular the segment comprising residues 67–78. Duplicated resonances likely arose from local conformational exchange induced by proline cis,trans-isomerization, conformational heterogeneity in regions with poorly defined secondary structure, or both. These characteristics are consistent with high temperature factors for the Cb region in the crystal structure of SycE-YopE(Cb) (6Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), especially in the α-helical region formed by residues 67–78. Thirty-five of the 40 15N,1H TROSY cross-peaks of free YopE that were shifted upon SycE binding were assigned in both free and chaperone-bound states. Notably, these shifted and dually assigned cross-peaks all mapped to residues in the Cb region (Fig. 1C). The magnitude of these shifts was large, indicating that a major structural transition had been brought about by SycE binding. Four residues within the Cb region had resonances that were unshifted: Gln51, Ser65, Val66, and Ala67. The crystal structure of the SycE-YopE(Cb) fragment shows that these residues are not contacted by SycE and lack regular secondary structure (6Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Comparison of dually assigned residues also revealed that SycE binding had no effect on the S1 region and likewise no effect on residues 81–100 connecting the Cb region to the RhoGAP domain. These results provide direct evidence for the effect of SycE binding being strictly localized to the Cb region of YopE and not extending outside the Cb region. Random Coil in the Cb Region of Free YopE—We next addressed the issue of whether the Cb region of free YopE was in a folded state. Backbone chemical shifts of free YopE were compared with those expected for a random coil state. The deviations from random coil values of secondary chemical shifts (Δδ) in 15N, 1H, and 13C dimensions of the Cb region of free YopE were found to be close to zero, indicating that this region was in a random coil state (Fig. 2). In contrast, when SycE was bound, these same residues of YopE had values significantly different from those typical for a random coil state (Fig. 2) (Δδ ≠ 0). The deviation from random coil values of 13C-α chemical shifts in SycE-bound YopE suggested an α-helical secondary structure for Asp37–Leu43 and Ala67–Ser79 and a β-strand secondary structure for Gly24–Gln34, Glu48–Gly52, and Arg58–Leu63, agreeing almost exactly with the crystal structure of the SycE-YopE(Cb) complex (6Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The only exception was Glu48–Gly52, which lacks β-strand characteristics in the crystal structure. These results provide evidence for SycE promoting a transition in the Cb region from an unstructured state to a structured conformation. As expected, there were large deviations from random coil values in secondary chemical shifts of the RhoGAP domain for both free and SycE-bound YopE (Fig. 2). 13C-α chemical shifts for this region were in close agreement with the crystal structure of this domain (23Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Routzahn K.M. Waugh D.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Residues 79–101 connecting the Cb region to the RhoGAP domain lacked detectable secondary structure regardless of SycE binding (Fig. 2), indicating that these residues likely serve as an unstructured linker. Disorder-to-Order Transition upon SycE Association—We next examined dynamic properties of free YopE to ask whether the Cb region, despite having random coil-like chemical shifts, was discretely structured. A heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOE experiment was carried out to examine the mobility of amide 1HN-15N bond vectors (28Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). In this experiment, values close to 1 correspond to 15N,1H moities that are well structured (i.e. values of 0.8–1.0 are indicative of a rotational correlation time that is greater than a few ns), and values <0.5 are indicative of an unstructured and flexible state (i.e. values <0 are indicative of a rotational correlation time of <1 ns). The 15N,1H moieties of the RhoGAP domain had 15N{1H} NOE values close to 1 in both free and SycE-bound YopE (Fig. 3A), indicating that the RhoGAP domain was well structured both in the presence and absence of SycE. In contrast, the N-terminal 98 residues of free YopE had markedly lower 15N{1H} NOE values (Fig. 3A), diagnostic of an unstructured and flexible state. The 15N{1H} NOEs of the Cb region were between 0.0 and 0.4, which indicated that this region had some local and limited ordering. Upon addition of SycE to free YopE, 15N{1H} NOE values in the Cb region (i.e. residues 22–83) rose considerably (Fig. 3A), providing evidence that the Cb region had become structurally constrained by SycE. Similarly, the intensities of the cross-peaks in the 15N,1H TROSY spectrum throughout the Cb region were significantly elevated in free YopE as compared with SycE-bound YopE, consistent with a disordered and flexible state in this region when free but structurally constrained when SycE-bound (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrated that the Cb region was unstructured and flexible in free YopE but nevertheless competent to bind SycE and that SycE binding caused a pronounced disorder-to-order transition within this region. Disorder of S1 with or without SycE—The cross-peaks of the 15N,1H TROSY spectra for the N-terminal 20 residues in free and SycE-bound forms of YopE superimposed well, indicating that SycE had no effect on the S1 region (Fig. 1). Based on the random coil-like chemical shifts (Fig. 2) and the negative 15N{1H} NOE values (Fig. 3), the S1 region appeared to be unstructured and flexible in both free and in SycE-bound YopE. It is noteworthy that in the flagellar export system, which is related to TTS systems, the N-terminal secretion signals of exported flagellar proteins are also disordered (29Daughdrill G.W. Chadsey M.S. Karlinsey J.E. Hughes K.T. Dahlquist F.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). No Association between SycE-YopE and YscN—A disorder-to-order transition imposed by SycE supports a targeting mechanism of chaperone action. Because association of chaperones and effectors and chaperone-effector complexes with membrane-associated TTS ATPases has been detected in Salmonella and E. coli (15Akeda Y. Galan J.E. Nature. 2005; 437: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 30Gauthier A. Finlay B.B. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6747-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether SycE-YopE, free YopE, or both associated with the Y. pseudotuberculosis TTS ATPase YscN (48 kDa). A detergent-solubilized Y. pseudotuberculosis lysate was prepared using a protocol similar to that used for detecting association in Salmonella and E. coli. The supernatant of this detergent-solubilized lysate was applied to streptavidin-agarose beads containing SycE-YopE complexes immobilized via site-specific biotinylation of YopE. Although YscN was evident in the supernatant of the detergent-solubilized lysate and in material that did not adhere to the beads, no YscN was detected bound to SycE-YopE (Fig. 4A). As a positive control, the supernatant of a detergent-solubilized lysate from Y. pseudotuberculosis (ΔyopE) was applied to biotinylated free YopE immobilized on streptavidin-agarose beads, and SycE was found to specifically associate with free YopE as expected (Fig. 4B). Again, no YscN was detected (data not shown), even though ∼13-fold more sample was applied to the YscN immunoblot as compared with the SycE immunoblot. TTS effectors have been observed to associate with their specific chaperones through a conserved binding mode. The most distinctive feature of this mode is the highly extended conformation of the effector Cb region, as seen for fragments of Salmonella SptP (4Stebbins C.E. Galan J.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and SipA (13Lilic M. Vujanac M. Stebbins C.E. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 653-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and Yersinia YopE (6Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), YscM2 (9Phan J. Tropea J.E. Waugh D.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1591-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and YopN (12Schubot F.D. Jackson M.W. Penrose K.J. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Plano G.V. Waugh D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) bound to their specific chaperones. However, the functional importance of this binding mode has remained unclear. To inform models of chaperone action, we investigated the consequences of SycE binding on the dynamics and structure of intact YopE through NMR studies. Three major conclusions derived from these studies. First, the effect of SycE binding was strictly localized and isolated to the Cb region of YopE, as deduced from comparison of 15N,1H TROSY spectra (Fig. 1). Binding by SycE had no effect on the YopE S1 region, the RhoGAP domain, or the linker region connecting Cb to the RhoGAP domain. Second, the Cb region in the absence of SycE appeared to be flexible and disordered, as evidenced by chemical shift analysis, 15N{1H} NOEs, and 15N,1H TROSY signal intensities (Fig. 3). It must be noted that the Cb region of free YopE had 15N{1H} NOE values between 0 and 0.4 (Fig. 3), which suggests some amount of local and limited ordering in this region. Such features may contribute to reducing the entropic cost of binding SycE. These data also revealed that nearly half of free YopE was unstructured and flexible (Fig. 5), thus identifying YopE as a member of the natively unfolded protein family (31Fink A.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). In host cells, the disordered state of the N-terminal region of YopE may be required for association with host cell membranes (32Krall R. Zhang Y. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2747-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), as has been suggested for several effectors (33Letzelter M. Sorg I. Mota L.J. Meyer S. Stalder J. Feldman M. Kuhn M. Callebaut I. Cornelis G.R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3223-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Third, as also revealed by chemical shifts, 15N{1H} NOEs, and 15N,1H TROSY NMR signal intensities, a pronounced disorder-to-order transition in the YopE Cb region was brought about by SycE binding. These conclusions are at odds with models of chaperone action that require consequences outside the Cb region, for example in priming unfolding of C-terminal host-interaction domains or ensuring proper presentation of the S1 region. These conclusions are also inconsistent with models in which chaperone binding maintains the Cb region in an unfolded state (4Stebbins C.E. Galan J.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Rather than maintaining an unfolded state in the effector, SycE was found to promote structuring of the YopE Cb region. Taken together with structural conservation of chaperone-effector complexes, our results are most consistent with a targeting model of action in which the Cb region in association with the chaperone constitutes a three-dimensional targeting signal (6Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The strongest experimental support for the targeting model comes from a Yersinia strain deleted of most of its effectors (ΔHOPEM) (34Boyd A.P. Grosdent N. Totemeyer S. Geuijen C. Bleves S. Iriarte M. Lambermont I. Octave J.N. Cornelis G.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this strain, neither SycE nor the Cb region of YopE is required for translocation, whereas in wild-type strains both are required. Dispensability of SycE and the Cb region in the ΔHOPEM strain suggests that chaperones have a role in enhancing interaction between effectors and a TTS component that is required for translocation and that is also limiting in a wild-type background (i.e. in the presence of other chaperone-effector complexes). Additional evidence for competition between chaperone-effector complexes exists (35Wulff-Strobel C.R. Williams A.W. Straley S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Whether this potentially limiting component is the TTS ATPase is not clear. In Salmonella, the SicP-SptP chaperone-effector complex interacts with the TTS ATPase InvC, but the chaperone SicP is sufficient for this interaction (15Akeda Y. Galan J.E. Nature. 2005; 437: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Likewise, in E. coli the chaperone CesT is sufficient for interaction with the TTS ATPase EscN and so too is the effector Tir (30Gauthier A. Finlay B.B. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6747-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Based on these data, it seems improbable that the TTS ATPase is the receptor for a putative translocation signal carried by the chaperone-effector complex, unless such complexes bind more strongly to the TTS ATPase than isolated chaperones and effectors. The relative affinities of chaperone-effector complexes as compared with individual components are not known. In Yersinia, interaction between SycE-YopE and the TTS ATPase YscN was not detected. Although multiple explanations exist for this result, it brings up the possibility that the putative receptor for a targeting signal in the SycE-YopE complex is a bacterial component other than YscN.

https://openalex.org/W2101961124,"Angiopoietins were thought to be endothelial cell-specific via the tie2 receptor. We showed that angiopoietin-1 (ang1) also interacts with integrins on cardiac myocytes (CMs) to increase survival. Because ang1 monomers bind and activate integrins (not tie2), we determined their function in vivo. We examined monomer and multimer expressions during physiological and pathological cardiac remodeling and overexpressed ang1 monomers in phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac ang1 levels (mRNA, protein) increased during postnatal development and decreased with phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy, whereas tie2 phosphorylations were unchanged. We found that most or all of the changes during cardiac remodeling were in monomers, offering an explanation for unchanged tie2 activity. Heart tissue contains abundant ang1 monomers and few multimers (Western blotting). We generated plasmids that produce ang1 monomers (ang1-256), injected them into mice, and confirmed cardiac expression (immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR). Ang1 monomers localize to CMs, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. In phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy, ang1-256 reduced left ventricle (LV)/tibia ratios, fetal gene expressions (atrial and brain natriuretic peptides, skeletal actin, beta-myosin heavy chain), and fibrosis (collagen III), and increased LV prosurvival signaling (akt, MAPK(p42/44)), and AMPK(T172). However, tie2 phosphorylations were unchanged. Ang1-256 increased integrin-linked kinase, a key regulator of integrin signaling and cardiac health. Collectively, these results suggest a role for ang1 monomers in cardiac remodeling."

SLE T cells express abnormally increased levels of an alternatively spliced isoform of CD3ζ that lacks a 562-bp region in its 3′-untranslated region (UTR). We showed previously that two adenosine/uridine-rich elements (ARE) in this splice-deleted region of CD3ζ transcript are critical for the mRNA stability and protein expression of CD3ζ. In this study we show for the first time that the mRNA-stabilizing protein HuR binds to these two ARE bearing regions of CD3ζ 3′-UTR. Knockdown of HuR resulted in decreased expression of the CD3ζ chain, whereas overexpression led to the increase of CD3ζ chain levels. Additionally, overexpression of HuR in human T cells resulted in increased mRNA stability of CD3ζ. Our results identify the 3′-UTR of CD3ζ as a novel target for the mRNA-stabilizing protein HuR. Thus, the absence of two critical AREs in the alternatively spliced CD3ζ 3′-UTR found in SLE T cells may result in decreased HuR binding, representing a possible molecular mechanism contributing to the reduced stability and expression of CD3ζ in SLE.

Several signaling abnormalities of the immune system have been described in SLE and are thought to be central in the pathophysiology of this disease (1Kyttaris V.C. Juang Y.T. Tsokos G.C. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2005; 17: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has extensively studied the intracellular signaling of SLE T cells and identified abnormal proximal as well as distal components of the signal transduction machinery. A common molecular feature of T cells from SLE patients is a unique rewiring of the T cell receptor wherein expression of the ζ chain, a critical intracellular signaling component of the CD3 complex, is decreased and is substituted by the Fc receptor γ (FcRγ) chain. This leads to a robust calcium influx once the cell is activated via the T cell receptor, whereas interleukin (IL)-2 production remains abnormally low (2Vassilopoulos D. Kovacs B. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2269-2281PubMed Google Scholar, 3Krishnan S. Warke V.G. Nambiar M.P. Tsokos G.C. Farber D.L. J.

Replenishment of the CD3ζ in SLE T cells in vitro restores IL-2 production and reduces intracellular calcium flux (5Nambiar M.P. Fisher C.U. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Mitchell J.P. Delaney N. Tsokos G.C. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 1948-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a central role for CD3ζ in the T cell defect.Multiple mechanisms have been found to contribute to the decreased expression of CD3ζ in SLE T cells. First, the transcriptional activity of the CD3ζ promoter is limited because of limited binding of the enhancer E-74-like factor (Elf)-1 (6Juang Y.T. Tenbrock K. Nambiar M.P. Gourley M.F. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6048-6055Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and increased binding of the repressor cAMP-response element modulator α (7Juang Y.T. Wang Y. Solomou E.E. Li Y. Mawrin C. Tenbrock K. Kyttaris V.C. Tsokos G.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), which is increased in SLE T cells. Second, CD3ζ is degraded by caspase 3, which is expressed at increased levels in SLE T cells (8Krishnan S. Kiang J.G. Fisher C.U. Nambiar M.P. Nguyen H.T. Kyttaris V.C. Chowdhury B. Rus V. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3417-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Third, CD3ζ mRNA in SLE T cells is produced in many alternatively spliced forms lacking coding regions that may result in nonfunctional CD3ζ chain (9Nambiar M.P. Enyedy E.J. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Dennis G. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. J. Autoimmun. 2001; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Nambiar M.P. Enyedy E.J. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Dennis G. Wong H.K. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1336-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Finally, in SLE T cells an alternatively spliced form of CD3ζ mRNA that lacks a 562-base-long (672–1233 nucleotide) region in its 3′-untranslated region (UTR) is produced in increased levels (9Nambiar M.P. Enyedy E.J. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Dennis G. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. J. Autoimmun. 2001; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This AS CD3ζ mRNA is significantly more unstable and has a lower protein expression than the wild-type (WT) CD3ζ mRNA (9Nambiar M.P. Enyedy E.J. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Dennis G. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. J. Autoimmun. 2001; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Chowdhury B. Tsokos C.G. Krishnan S. Robertson J. Fisher C.U. Warke R.G. Warke V.G. Nambiar M.P. Tsokos G.C.

The WT CD3ζ mRNA bears three AUUUA motifs or AREs at positions 636, 705, and 985 in its 3′-UTR, henceforth referred to as ARE1, ARE2, and ARE3, respectively. The AS 3′-UTR is missing the ARE2 and ARE3 regions that are contained in the 672–1233 stretch that is splice-deleted in SLE T cells (Fig. 1). Both these elements are independently important for the mRNA stability and protein expression of the CD3ζ chain. A mutation of either ARE2 or ARE3 led to a reduced expression of the CD3ζ chain whereas a mutation in ARE1 did not (12Chowdhury B. Krishnan S. Tsokos C.G. Robertson J.W. Fisher C.U. Nambiar M.P. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 8248-8257Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms by which the ARE2 and ARE3 promote CD3ζ mRNA stability are unknown.AREs are the best known stability elements regulating mammalian messages and are known to control mRNA stability of various cytokines, transcription factors, and growth factors. ARE-binding proteins alter the fate of mRNA by regulating the deadenylation and decapping processes of mRNA decay (13Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Gao M. Wilusz C.J. Peltz S.W. Wilusz J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1134-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). ARE-binding proteins such as Hu-antigen R (HuR) can stabilize the message by competing with destabilizing proteins (15Lal A. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Kawai T. Yang X. Martindale J.L. Gorospe M.

HuR (also known as HuA) is ubiquitously expressed, whereas HuB, HuC, and HuD are neuron-specific in their expression. HuR is one of the best studied ARE-binding proteins and has been shown to stabilize/regulate numerous genes, including tumor necrosis factor-α (13Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J.

Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). HuR has been proposed to bind ARE containing mRNA in the nucleus, and to remain bound during mRNA transport to the cytoplasm thereby protecting the mRNA from degradation (25Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar).Based on our previous findings that ARE2 and ARE3 are critical for mRNA stability and protein expression of CD3ζ, we hypothesized that proteins binding to ARE2 and ARE3 regulate the expression of CD3ζ by promoting the stability of CD3ζ mRNA. We show here for the first time that the embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV)-like protein HuR binds to the ARE2 and ARE3 bearing regions of the CD3ζ 3′-UTR and regulates the CD3ζ protein expression and mRNA stability.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Antibodies—Jurkat T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in culture under sterile conditions in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin antibiotics. Peripheral blood T cells were purified using the Rosette Sep kit (Stem Cell Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies to HuR, CD3ζ, NFATc, and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). β-Actin and FLAG antibodies were purchased from Sigma; β-tubulin antibody was from Upstate (Millipore, Billerica, MA); TTP was from Abcam Inc.

Transient transfections of peripheral blood primary T cells were carried out using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of nucleofector solution. Plasmid DNA (1.5–2 μg per 106 cells) was added, and cells were transfected using the nucleofector U-014 program. Cells were rescued immediately after transfection in pre-warmed RPMI medium + 10% fetal bovine serum in a 6-well culture plate.Oligonucleotide Pulldown Assay—Custom-synthesized 25-base biotin-labeled ARE2 and ARE3 bearing RNA oligonucleotides and random scrambled control RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Sequences of the oligonucleotides are as follows: ARE2 oligonucleotide, 5′-UGCUUUGGUUAUAUUUAGCUCCAAA-3′; ARE3 oligonucleotide, 5′-CUCCUGCUGUAAAUUUAGCUUCUGU-3′; control oligonucleotide, 5′-AAGAUGUCAAUGUCACUGUCUGAAC-3′.Streptavidin magnetic beads (PureBiotech LLC, Middlesex, NJ) were washed three times in Hepes-buffered saline (HBS-P) wash buffer (0.01 m Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P-20, and 5 mm MgCl2; Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). 40 pmol of biotinylated RNA oligonucleotides were incubated with 30 μl of washed streptavidin magnetic beads in binding buffer (wash buffer with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at room temperature. Magnetic bead-bound oligonucleotides were selected using a magnetic particle separator (PureBiotech, LLC). Jurkat cell nuclear lysates (∼700 μg) were pretreated with polyinosine-cytosine (dI-dC) (50 μg/400 μgof lysate) and 16 units of RNasin/100 μg lysate in binding buffer at room temperature for 15 min. 100 μl of bead oligonucleotide was added to the nuclear lysate and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The magnetic particle separator was used to selectively bind oligo-protein complexes, whereas unbound proteins were washed three times with binding buffer. Each wash fraction was collected and labeled Wash 1, 2 (Fig. 2A, lanes 4, 5, 9, and 10), and 3. Binding buffer with 0.3 m NaCl was used for a pre-elute wash. Bound proteins were eluted from the oligonucleotides using 10 mm glycine/HCl, pH 2.0 (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Three eluate fractions were collected and labeled Elute 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3 and 6–8). Washes and eluates (13 μl) were loaded onto a 12-well 1.0-mm 4–6% Bistris NuPAGE pre-cast gel (Invitrogen) and run at 200 V for 35 min. Silver staining of the gel was carried out according to instructions in the Silver Express staining kit (Invitrogen). Specific bands were excised and washed twice in 50% acetonitrile.FIGURE 2Identification of proteins binding to CD3ζ 3′-UTR ARE2 bearing RNA oligonucleotide.

Cysteine residues were then reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 56 °C and alkylated with 10 mm iodoacetamide in the dark for 45 min. Gel bands were then washed and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator. 250 ng of modified trypsin Promega (Madison, WI) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, was added, and the protein bands were digested overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate following 40% acetonitrile, 2% formic acid to a final elution volume of 65 μl.A4-μl aliquot of peptide mixture was injected onto a microcapillary reversed-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry system using a self-packed 75-μm inner diameter × 10-cm length C18 column at a flow rate of ∼300 nl/min. Data-dependent MS/MS spectra were collected using a Thermo Scientific LTQ two-dimensional linear ion trap mass spectrometer operated in the positive ion mode. MS/MS spectra were searched versus a reversed nonredundant protein data base from NCBI using the Sequest® algorithm. Identified data base peptide sequences were validated using score cutoffs as well as manual inspection to ensure that the sequences were consistent with the typical b- and y-series fragment ions.RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—20 pmol of RNA oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a 10× T4 Kinase buffer (Fisher), with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and RNasin for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer and radiolabeled probes were separated using microspin columns (GE Healthcare). Jurkat cell nuclear lysates were incubated with antibody or excess cold (unlabeled) probe in a 5× high density TBE buffer with 1 n KCl, 500 μg of poly(dI·dC), and RNasin on ice for 15 min. 20 pmol of [32P]ATP-labeled RNA probes were added, and reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for another 15 min and then electrophoresed on a 6% DNA retardation gel at 110 V for 45 min. Gels were fixed in a solution containing 10% acetic acid and 10% methanol for 10 min, dried in a gel dryer for 1 h at 80 °C under vacuum, exposed overnight to a phosphor screen, and scanned using a PhosphorImager scanner (GE Healthcare).Short Interfering (si) RNA Knockdown Studies—A pair of siRNAs against HuR Hs_ELAVL1_10 (target sequence CAG AAA CAT TTG AGC ATT GTA) and Hs_ELAVL1_9 (target sequence CAC AGT GAA GTT TGC AGC CAA) and control nonsilencing rhodamine siRNA (target sequence AAT TCT CCG AAC GTG TCA CGT) were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). siRNA knockdown experiments were carried out using the Amaxa Nucleofector system. Briefly, 5 × 106 Jurkat cells were resuspended in 100 μl of cell line Nucleofector solution (Amaxa Inc. Gaithersburg, MD), and transient transfection of 1.5–2 μg of control or HuR-specific siRNA was carried out using the Nucleofector program C-016. Cells were immediately rescued in 2 ml of prewarmed RPMI + 10% fetal bovine serum medium in 6-well plates and rested in a 37 °C incubator. Cells were harvested, and cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates were made 24–48 h post-transfection.Western Blotting—Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared using Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) and Buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors 5 mm sodium fluoride (NaF), 4 mm sodium vanadate (Na3VO4), aprotinin, leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. 5 × 106 cells were pelleted and resuspended in 400 μl of Buffer A and kept on ice for 15 min. 25 μl of Nonidet P-40 was added; the suspension was vortexed for 10 s and immediately centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was collected and labeled as the cytoplasmic fraction, and the pellet was washed with Buffer A. After discarding the supernatant, 50 μl of Buffer C was added to the pellet, shaken on a rotator for 15 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 13,200 for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and labeled as the nuclear fraction. Extracts were resolved on a 4–12% Bistris NuPAGE precast gel at 200 V for 35 min and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 30 V for 75 min. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBS-T) buffer for 1 h followed by incubation with primary antibody (1:1000) for 1 h, washed three times with TBS-T, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h, washed three times with TBS-T buffer, incubated for 1 min with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized by autoradiography.mRNA Expression Studies—Total mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) from primary T cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. 0.1–1 μgof total RNA was reverse-transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase-based system from Promega (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Genomics core) for quantitative real time PCR of wild-type CD3ζ 3′-UTR were as follows: forward, 5′-AGT GGC TTC ACT CCT GCT GT 3′ (sense bp 963–982), and reverse 5′-GCC TAG GCT CCT TTC CAT CT 3′ (antisense bp 1096-1077), according to the numbering of Weissman et al. (27Weissman A.M. Hou D. Orloff D.G. Modi W.S. Seuanez H. O'Brien S.J. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9709-9713Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This primer pair amplifies the splice deleted region of ζ 3′-UTR specific to the wild-type isoform. GAPDH was used as a control, and the primers were as follows: forward, 5′-CAA CTA CAT GGT TTA CAT GTT CC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGA CTG TGG TCA TGA GTC CT-3′. The reverse transcription product cDNA was diluted 2-fold, and SYBR green master mix (Roche Applied Science) was used for amplification of CD3ζ or GAPDH control. Real time PCR amplification was carried out in a LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science) as follows: initial denaturation cycle at 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles of amplification with denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s, 1 cycle of melting curves at 95 °C for 15 s, 65 °C for 2 min, and 97 °C continuous and a final cooling step at 37 °C for 30 s. All samples were run in triplicate and average threshold cycle (Ct) values were used to calculate relative mRNA expression by the ΔΔCt relative quantification analysis method. For semi-quantitative PCR of wild-type ζ, primers used were forward, 5′-AGC CTC TGC CTC CCA GCC TCT TTC TGA G-3′ (sense bp 34–62), and reverse, 5′-CCT GTA GCA CAT GGT ACA GTT CAA TGG TG-3′ (antisense bp 1233-1205), and primers for AS ζ were forward, 5′-AGC CTC TGC CTC CCA GCC TCT TTC TGA G-3′ (sense bp 34–62), and reverse, 5′-CAT CTT CTG GCC CTT CAG TGG CTG AGA AGA GTG AA-3′ (antisense bp 1235-1234 and 671-649; this primer spans both sides of the alternative splice site and is specific for the AS ζ isoform) according to the numbering of Weissman et al. (27Weissman A.M. Hou D. Orloff D.G. Modi W.S. Seuanez H. O'Brien S.J. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9709-9713Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out in a Bio-Rad thermal cycler as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, 40 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s; 67 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 2 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Quantitation of the PCR product was done using the Quantity1 software (Bio-Rad).Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—Densitometric analysis of the Western blots was performed with the Quantity 1 software (Bio-Rad). Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test.RESULTSIdentification of Putative Proteins Binding to ARE2 in the 3′-UTR of CD3ζ Chain—The 3′-UTR of CD3ζ contains three ARE, two of which (ARE2 and ARE3) are missing in SLE T cells. Chowdhury et al. (12Chowdhury B. Krishnan S. Tsokos C.G. Robertson J.W. Fisher C.U. Nambiar M.P. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 8248-8257Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) showed that a mutation of the AUUUA to GGGUA in either ARE2 or ARE3 of CD3ζ 3′-UTR led to a significant reduction in the mRNA stability and protein expression of CD3ζ, indicating that the ARE2 and ARE3 regions positively regulate the integrity of CD3ζ mRNA. Because SLE T cells express very low levels of the wild-type CD3ζ mRNA, we used Jurkat T cells that express this transcript abundantly. To identify proteins that bind to the two AREs and function to stabilize CD3ζ mRNA, we used custom-synthesized biotin-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide encoding the ARE2. This oligonucleotide contained the sequence 693–717 of the CD3ζ 3′-UTR, including the AUUUA pentamer at position 705. A random scrambled 25-base-long sequence with similar GC content was used as the control. The ARE2-bearing oligonucleotide or the control oligonucleotide were incubated with Jurkat cell nuclear extracts, and as shown in Fig. 2A, after washing off the unbound proteins (Wash 1 and Wash 2), several binding proteins were eluted from the ARE2 oligonucleotide (elute 1 and elute 2) with a 10 mm glycine/HCl, pH 2.0, solution. More specifically, three protein bands with molecular mass of 36, 45, and 50 kDa were found to bind to the ARE2 oligonucleotide but not to the control oligonucleotide. Because several of the known RNA-binding proteins in the existing literature lie within the 30- to 60-kDa molecular mass range, we chose to analyze these three bands by mass spectrometry.Mass spectrometry of the p36 complex revealed 14 peptides that matched with the N-terminal region of the ELAV protein family member HuR (Fig. 2C). Additionally, analysis of the 36-kDa band showed the presence of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 (5 peptide match), hnRNP A0 (three peptide match), and hnRNP A2/B1 (three peptide match). The 50-kDa band revealed a five peptide match with hnRNP G, whereas the 45-kDa band contained hnRNP A3 (seven peptide match), hnRNP AB (four peptide match), and hnRNP A2/B1 (three peptide match). Among these proteins, HuR is one of the best described proteins for its role in mRNA stability. Additionally, analysis of the CD3ζ 3′-UTR sequence revealed predicted HuR-binding sites (28Lopez de Silanes I. Zhan M. Lal A. Yang X. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2987-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) in the vicinity of both the ARE2 and ARE3 regions (Fig. 1B, underlined and italicized). Hence we chose to analyze the role of this protein in regulating CD3ζ. Western blot with an HuR-specific antibody showed the presence of this protein in the eluate of the ARE2 oligonucleotide pulldown but not in the eluate of the control oligonucleotide (Fig. 2B). These data show that HuR may bind to the ARE2-containing region of CD3ζ 3′-UTR.HuR Binds to the ARE2 and ARE3 Bearing Regions of the 3′-UTR of CD3ζ—Because our mass spectrometry results indicated a potential interaction between HuR and the ARE2 bearing region of the 3′-UTR of CD3ζ, we performed RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays using ARE2, ARE3, and ARE1 containing oligonucleotides and Jurkat cell nuclear extracts. As seen in Fig. 3A, there was a specific band that could be supershifted upon addition of anti-HuR antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 2) but not with the addition of an unrelated NFATc antibody (lane 3). This indicated that HuR bound specifically to this ARE2-containing oligonucleotide. In a similar assay using ARE3-bearing oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B), the addition of HuR-specific antibody (lane 2) but not an unrelated NFATc antibody (lane 3) abolished the formation of the RNA-protein complexes as compared with lane 1, indicating the presence of HuR in these complexes as well. We performed the same assay using a radiolabeled ARE1-bearing RNA oligonucleotide and did not observe the formation of RNA-protein complexes (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3HuR binds to the ARE2 and ARE3 bearing regions of CD3ζ 3′-UTR.

The corresponding enzyme was classified as a cation- and S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase (SynOMT), consistent with considerable amino acid sequence identities to eukaryotic O-methyltransferases (OMTs). The substrate specificity of SynOMT was similar with those of plant and mammalian CCoAOMT-like proteins accepting a variety of hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids as substrates. In contrast to the known mammalian and plant enzymes, which exclusively methylate the meta-hydroxyl position of aromatic di- and trihydroxy systems, Syn-OMT also methylates the para-position of hydroxycinnamic acids like 5-hydroxyferulic and 3,4,5-trihydroxycinnamic acid, resulting in the formation of novel compounds. The x-ray structure of SynOMT indicates that the active site allows for two alternative orientations of the hydroxylated substrates in comparison to the active sites of animal and plant enzymes, consistent with the observed preferred para-methylation and position promiscuity. Lys(3) close to the N terminus of the recombinant protein appears to play a key role in the activity of the enzyme. The possible implications of these results with respect to modifications of precursors of polymers like lignin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2039282367,"In Xenopus oocytes, the water permeability of AQP0 (Pf) increases with removal of external calcium, an effect that is mediated by cytoplasmic calmodulin (CaM) bound to the C terminus of AQP0. To investigate the effects of serine phosphorylation on CaM-mediated Ca2+ regulation of Pf, we tested the effects of kinase activation, CaM inhibition, and a series of mutations in the C terminus CaM binding site. Calcium regulation of AQP0 Pf manifests four distinct phenotypes: Group 1, with high Pf upon removal of external Ca2+ (wild-type, S229N, R233A, S235A, S235K, K238A, and R241E); Group 2, with high Pf in elevated (5 mm) external Ca2+ (S235D and R241A); Group 3, with high Pf and no Ca2+ regulation (S229D, S231N, S231D, S235N, and S235N/I236S); and Group 4, with low Pf and no Ca2+ regulation (protein kinase A and protein kinase C activators, S229D/S235D and S235N/I236S). Within each group, we tested whether CaM binding mediates the phenotype, as shown previously for wild-type AQP0. In the presence of calmidazolium, a CaM inhibitor, S235D showed high Pf and no Ca2+ regulation, suggesting that S235D still binds CaM. Contrarily, S229D showed a decrease in recruitment of CaM, suggesting that S229D is unable to bind CaM. Taken together, our results suggest a model in which CaM acts as an inhibitor of AQP0 Pf. CaM binding is associated with a low Pf state, and a lack of CaM binding is associated with a high Pf state.

In the equatorial region of the lens, metabolically active epithelial cells differentiate into less active fiber cells and form the cortical region of the lens. In the core of the lens, mature fiber cells lack nuclei and organelles (1Smith R.S. John S.W.M. Nishina P.M. Sundberg J.P. Systematic Evaluation of the Mouse Eye.

Mature lens fiber cells are characterized by slow protein turnover and increasing post-translational modifications such as proteolytic cleavage, glycation, and phosphorylation. In the cortex of the lens, there is an elevated level of phosphorylated proteins, demonstrating the significance of phosphorylation in lens differentiation (3Hanson S.R. Hasan A. Smith D.L.

Gap junctions, water channels, Na+/K+ pumps, and Ca2+, K+, Na+, and Cl- channels act in concert to maintain cellular homeostasis, possibly by generating an intrinsic lens circulation (6Mathias R.T.

Such a proposed intrinsic circulation would move nutrients from the aqueous humor to core fiber cells and waste products away from the central part of the lens toward the surface.

Lenses of AQP0 knock-out mice (AQP0-/-) present congenital cataracts, fail to develop normal structure, and lose 80% of their water permeability (10Shiels A. Bassnett S. Nat.

When AQP0 and AQP0-LTR (a naturally occurring C-terminal mutant of AQP0) are expressed together in transgenic mice, the lenses show incomplete fiber cell development. In vitro expression of wild-type AQP0 and AQP0-LTR in Xenopus oocyte showed that AQP0 is a functional water channel in the presence of AQP0-LTR protein but lacks calcium regulation (14Shiels A.

The elimination of Ca2+ regulation of water permeability could be a contributing cause of the aberrant lens development of AQP0-LTR transgenic mice. The water permeability (Pf) of AQP0 is regulated by pH, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Ca2+ (16Németh-Cahalan K.L. Hall J.E. J. Biol.

In the Xenopus oocyte expression system, shifting the pH from 7.4 to 6.5 or lowering the physiological external Ca2+ from 2 to 0 mm increases AQP0 water permeability. The calcium effect is mediated through CaM bound to the C terminus of AQP0 (16Németh-Cahalan K.L. Hall J.E. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2004; 123: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In lens vesicle preparation, AQP0 Pf increases with acid pH and 5 mm Ca2+ (19Varadaraj K. Kumari S. Shiels A. Mathias R.T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that the difference between oocytes and lens vesicles results (5 mm calcium instead of 0 mm) could be explained by a difference in affinity for apo-CaM and calcium/CaM, due to a different lipid composition of the membranes. In a normal lens, phosphorylation of the C terminus of AQP0 is up-regulated in the cortex, and the phosphorylation prediction data base flags the serines at positions 229, 231, and 235 as consensus PKA and PKC phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1A) (4Ball L.E. Garland D.L. Crouch R.K. Schey K.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9856-9865Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Garland D. Russell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schey K.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9856-9865Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At position 235, the level of serine phosphorylation increases from the outer to the inner cortex. In the CaM binding site (residues 223-243) (22Girsch S.J. Peracchia C. Curr. Eye. Res. 1991; 10: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the high-resolution structure of the C-terminal end shows that the target serines form an exposed ridge (Fig. 1B) (23Gonen T.

Rose et al. (26Rose K.M. Wang Z. Magrath G.N. Hazard E.S. Hildebrandt J.D. Schey K.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have shown that a phosphorylated AQP0 C terminus peptide binds CaM more weakly than the unphosphorylated form, and we (16Németh-Cahalan K.L. Hall J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6777-6782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) have shown that CaM inhibitors increase the water permeability of AQP0 in Xenopus oocytes. It is thus plausible that phosphorylation weakens CaM binding just as CaM inhibitors do. To study the effects of phosphorylation on AQP0 water permeability, we used a combination of PKA and PKC activators, CaM inhibitor calmidazolium (CDZ), and AQP0 mutants that were designed to mimic or prevent phosphorylation of particular target serines and studied their effects on CaM-mediated Ca2+ regulation of Pf in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Because differences in mutant expression might mask regulatory effects of interest, we developed an antibody against the extracellular E loop to test the expression of AQP0 in the presence of PKA and PKC activators and the expression of AQP0 mutants. We compared the association of a fluorescently labeled CaM (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated CaM; CaM-488) with wild-type AQP0 to its association with the phosphorylation-mimicking mutant, S229D. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (catalog no. 200516-5). The oligo-DNAs for the mutations were synthesized at Sigma Genosys, and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing at the University of Chicago Cancer Research Center DNA Sequencing Facility. cRNA Preparation for Xenopus Oocytes—The expression construct for bovine AQP0 (pXβG-AQP0) was a kind gift from Peter Agre (Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD). Wild-type and mutated AQP0 cRNAs were transcribed in vitro using the T3 RNA polymerase (mMACHINE kit, Ambion, Inc.). Xenopus Oocyte Swelling Assay—Female Xenopus laevis were anesthetized, and stage V and VI oocytes were prepared and injected with 10 ng of cRNA as described previously (16Németh-Cahalan K.L. Hall J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6777-6782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 27Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). The oocytes were incubated in 100% ND96 buffer with the desired test Ca2+ concentration and pH for 5 min before the swelling assay. Swelling assays were performed at room temperature (20-21 °C) by transferring oocytes from a 200 mosm (100% ND96 in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 5 HEPES, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 2.5 sodium pyruvate, pH 7.4) to a 70 mosm (30% ND96) solution adjusted to the desired calcium concentration and pH. Each data point is the average of at least nine measurements (three different batches of oocytes and three oocytes from each batch). Error bars are shown as ± S.E., and we performed a Student's t test to check the significance of differences of water permeability. All results with p values <10-6 are marked with an asterisk on the figures. PKA and PKC Activation in Xenopus Oocytes—PKA and PKC activators were applied for 15 min before the swelling assays were performed (PKA activator mixture, 10 μm dibutyryl-cAMP; 25 μm forskolin; or PKC activator, 20 nm PMA) and were maintained during the swelling assays. Oocyte Membrane Isolation and Immunoblot Analysis—Total membranes of 10 oocytes were prepared with the ProteoExtract® native membrane protein extraction kit (Calbiochem) according the manufacturer's directions. Half an oocyte of each sample was loaded and run on a 4-12% SDS NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) and then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked with 3% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with anti-AQP0 antibody (a 1:500 dilution of a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the external E loop of AQP0 (amino acids from 184-202, N-MNPARSFAPAILTRNFSNHW-C)). Then it was washed three times (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Finally, it was washed three times again and visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico rabbit IgG detection system (Pierce). Calmodulin Inhibitor Treatment—Oocytes were soaked in 5 μm CDZ for 30 min in the dark. CDZ was maintained during the swelling assays with 2 mm Ca2+. Detection of CaM-488 in Xenopus Oocytes—Xenopus oocytes exhibiting a Pf of 30-35 μm/s for the wild type and a Pf of 60-65 μm/s for S229D mutant were selected for these experiments. The oocytes were injected (5 ng/oocyte, 0.3 μm approximate concentration) with CaM-488 (Molecular Probes, catalog no. C13844) 12-24 h after AQP0 WT or mutant cRNA injection. Two days after AQP0 WT or mutant cRNA injection, water permeability was measured, and the oocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in artificial sea water (460 mm NaCl, 10.4 mm KCl, 55 mm MgCl2, 11 mm CaCl2, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, and 400 mm sucrose). For confocal microscopy, the oocytes were placed in a holding chamber to position them with the equator perpendicular to the plane of imaging. The oocytes were imaged at 488 nm excitation (emission filter 500-530 nm, 25% laser intensity, and 1 Airy unit) to detect CaM-488 at the oocyte membrane. Cross-sectional images of oocytes were taken and quantified by image analysis software (LSM510Meta). Phosphorylation by PKA or PKC Activators Alters Ca2+ Regulation of AQP0—Both PKA and PKC activators eliminated the calcium regulation of AQP0 Pf in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2A). In the presence of the PKA activator mixture, the water permeability of AQP0 was comparable with that of AQP0 in untreated oocytes, but its Ca2+ regulation and pH 6.5-induced Pf increase were abolished. In the presence of PMA (a PKC activator), the Ca2+ modulation of Pf was abolished, but the pH 6.5 Pf increase remained intact. We used our antibody directed against the extracellular E loop (residues 184-202) of AQP0 to confirm that the expression levels of AQP0 at the plasma membrane were not altered by incubation with PKA or PKC activators (Fig. 2B). In summary, the Ca2+ regulation of AQP0 water permeability was lost upon either PKA or PKC phosphorylation of AQP0, and PKA phosphorylation also abolished the increase in water permeability induced by pH 6.5, whereas PKC phosphorylation did not. Pseudophosphorylation of Key Serines in the CaM Binding Site Determines Pf and Ca2+ Regulation of Pf—The three C-terminal serines (Ser229, Ser231, and Ser235) of AQP0 are phosphorylated in the normal lens (4Ball L.E. Garland D.L. Crouch R.K. Schey K.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9856-9865Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the pattern of phosphorylation in the CaM binding domain of AQP0 (Fig. 1B) is likely a critical determinant of CaM binding and Ca2+ regulation of AQP0 Pf. To investigate this further, we created pseudophosphorylated mutants of AQP0 (S229D, S231D, S235D, and S229D/S235D) and tested their effect on the water permeability and on the Ca2+ regulation of Pf (Fig. 3A). Because the response to Ca2+ and pH depends on whether a particular mutant is in a high or low Pf state under standard conditions, it is critical to have experimental criteria defining “high” and “low” Pf. We consider AQP0 or its mutant to be in a low Pf state if a 10-ng cRNA expression results in a Pf with a value of 30-50 μm/s at 2 mm Ca2+, pH 7.4, and can be further increased by a factor of 1.5-2 in pH 6.5 test solution reaching a maximum value of 60-80 μm/s. We consider a mutant to be in a high Pf state when 10-ng cRNA expression results in a Pf value of 60-80 μm/s at 2 mm Ca2+, pH 7.4, and pH 6.5 produces no further increase. Two mutations (S229D and S231D) each produced a high Pf channel phenotype insensitive to calcium or pH. The S235D mutation showed a unique phenotype in which Pf was in the low state and in which the calcium response shifted from increased Pf in 0 mm Ca2+ to increased Pf in 5 mm Ca2+. The S235D mutation mimicked the Ca2+ sensitivity measured in lens vesicles (19Varadaraj K. Kumari S. Shiels A. Mathias R.T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This mutant also retained the pH 6.5-induced increase in Pf of wild-type AQP0. We constructed an additional double mutant, S229D/S235D, mimicking presumptive PKA phosphorylation. The addition of two negative charges eliminated the Ca2+ regulation, but the water permeability still increased at pH 6.5. Western blots of these mutants (Fig. 3B) confirm that expression levels of pseudophosphorylated AQP0s were comparable with that of wild-type AQP0, as expected from the magnitudes of the induced water permeability. The involvement of CaM in 5 mm Ca2+ sensitivity was tested by incubating the S235D mutant with CDZ, a CaM inhibitor that binds with high affinity to CaM. Fig. 3C shows that Pf of AQP0 and S235D was increased in the presence of CDZ, indicating that CaM is involved in 5 mm Ca2+ sensitivity. In summary, phosphorylation of three key serines located at the CaM binding site determines the water permeability and its Ca2+ sensitivity of AQP0. The Low Water Permeability State of AQP0 Is Associated with Bound CaM—Pseudophosphorylation of AQP0 in the CaM binding site creates two water permeability phenotypes: a low Pf state and a high Pf state. In response to reports of reduced CaM binding in the presence of phosphorylated peptides, we tested whether these phenotypes could arise from altered affinity of CaM binding. To do this, we measured the recruitment of fluorescent CaM, CaM-488, to the membrane by both low Pf (wild-type) and by the high Pf mutant S229D. To visualize localization of CaM binding, we injected CaM-488 into oocytes expressing either wild-type AQP0 or S229D mutant protein and measured membrane-associated fluorescence. Fig. 4A shows that CaM-488 is stable in Xenopus oocytes, and even without exogenous protein expression, there is background CaM-488 fluorescence at the oocyte membrane (UI panel). Endogenous CaM is in the μm range in Xenopus oocytes (25Lan L. Brereton H. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When AQP0 was expressed in the presence of CaM-488, fluorescence at the membrane increased about 3-fold (AQP0 panel). When the S229D mutant was expressed in the presence of CaM-488, the increase in fluorescence at the oocyte membrane was about 1.6-fold more than uninjected oocytes. Fig. 4B shows the bar graphs of the average membrane fluorescence values. These experiments suggest that the low water permeability of AQP0 is strongly associated with CaM-488, whereas the high Pf S229D mutant weakly binds CaM-488, as expected from the peptide binding results of Rose et al. (26Rose K.M. Wang Z. Magrath G.N. Hazard E.S. Hildebrandt J.D. Schey K.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Replacement of Serines with Neutral Amino Acids Can Result in the Loss of Calcium Regulation—Position, charge, or size of the amino acids at the critical serine positions in the CaM binding site can alter the water permeability of AQP0 and its Ca2+ regulation. Substitution of asparagine for serine at position 229 had no effect on the calcium sensitivity, Pf, or pH sensitivity (Fig. 5A). However, the same substitution at Ser231 and Ser235 resulted in a high water permeability channel with a Pf between 78 and 85 μm/s and lacking sensitivity to either Ca2+ or pH. The double mutant, S229N/S235D, also exhibited a high Pf phenotype and lost both Ca2+ and pH regulation. A second double mutation, S235N/I236S, effectively shifted the position of the serine toward the C terminus and away from the “serine-ridge” line (Fig. 1B). This produced a low water permeability channel lacking Ca2+ regulation but with pH regulation intact. The Western blot of Fig. 5B shows that all mutants are expressed at approximately the same levels as wild-type AQP0. In particular, the mutant S229N, which has the same regulation as the wild type, had slightly lower water permeability than the wild type, probably accounted for by a slightly decreased expression level. It is important to note that none of the regulation differences between these mutants and wild type can be accounted for by differences in expression level. We additionally tested the role of three positive charges (Arg233, Lys238, and Arg241) in CaM binding (data not shown). Three of our four mutations (R233A, K238A, and R241E) did not change the modulation phenotype, and one (R241A) shifted the Ca2+ sensitivity toward 5 mm, similar to S235D (Table 1).TABLE 1AQP0 has four calcium regulation phenotypesGroup 1aLow Pf at 2 mm Ca2+ and high Pf at 0 mm Ca2+.Group 2bLow Pf at 2 mm Ca2+ and high Pf at 5 mm Ca2+.Group 3cLocked in high Pf and no Ca2+ regulation.Group 4dLocked in low Pf and no Ca2+ regulation.WTS229NS229DR233AS235DS231NS229D/S235DS235AR241AS231DS235KS235NS235N/I236SK238AS229N/S235DR241Ea Low Pf at 2 mm Ca2+ and high Pf at 0 mm Ca2+.b Low Pf at 2 mm Ca2+ and high Pf at 5 mm Ca2+.c Locked in high Pf and no Ca2+ regulation.d Locked in low Pf and no Ca2+ regulation. Open table in a new tab In this study, we have shown that the pattern of phosphorylation at the C terminus of AQP0 profoundly influences its water permeability and its regulation by calcium. Calcium regulation of AQP0 is mediated by CaM, and modifications of key residues in the CaM binding site alter the calcium regulation and water permeability.

Our results suggest a model in which CaM binding inhibits AQP0 Pf. AQP0 Exhibits Four Calcium Regulation Phenotypes—The phenotypes of 15 mutations are summarized in Table 1 based on water permeability and Ca2+ sensitivity. The mutations segregate into four groups: Group 1, high Pf with removal of external Ca2+ (WT, S229N, R233A, S235A, S235K, K238A, and R241E); Group 2, high Pf with 5 mm external Ca2+ (S235D and R241A); Group 3, high Pf and no Ca2+ regulation (S229D, S231N, S231D, S235N, and S235N/I236S); and Group 4, low Pf and no Ca2+ regulation (S229D/S235D and S235N/I236S). Our results show that the three serine positions are not equivalent for regulation of Pf and, according to our model, CaM binding. For example, at position 229, the addition of a negative charge (S229D) shifts the phenotype to Group 3, whereas S229N retains wild-type modulation. In contrast, at position 231, an increase in charge or size results in high Pf and a loss of Ca2+ regulation (Group 3). Mutations at position 235 exhibit three different phenotypes that cannot be explained simply by size or charge of the substituted amino acid (see discussion below). A Model for CaM as an Inhibitor of AQP0 Water Permeability—A body of evidence from functional studies demonstrates that AQP0 water permeability is regulated extrinsically by changes in pH or calcium concentration (16Németh-Cahalan K.L. Hall J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6777-6782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 18Németh-Cahalan K.L. Kalman K. Froger A. Hall J.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Varadaraj K. Kumari S. Shiels A. Mathias R.T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For regulation by calcium, most of the effects can be accounted for by a simple two-state model in which the Pf of AQP0 can transition from low to high when CaM unbinds from the C terminus (Fig. 6). Under physiological conditions in the presence of Ca2+, when CaM is bound to the C terminus of wild-type AQP0, Pf is low. When Ca2+ is removed from the external solution, the Ca2+ concentration at the oocyte membrane plummets, leading to the release of CaM from the C terminus of AQP0. CaM-free AQP0 would then enter into the high Pf state. Because the phosphorylation sites are not equivalent in their effects, CaM release can apparently be effected in two ways. At position 229, the negative charge induced by pseudophosphorylation induces the high Pf state, presumably by weakening interactions between CaM and the C terminus binding site. In addition, many of the mutations shown probably alter the binding affinity or the binding site of the C terminus in some fashion. Indeed, we directly demonstrated that this is so for the high Pf mutant S229D (Fig. 4). At positions 231 and 235, an increase in amino acid size or charge (S231N and S235N) induces the high Pf phenotype, leading to the prediction that these mutations would also release CaM because of structural changes in the binding site. This model accounts for nearly all of our observations, summarized in Table 1. Effects of Two Mutations That Are Not Accounted for by This Model—First, the double mutant S229D/S235D presumably cannot bind CaM but is nevertheless in a low permeability state unresponsive to calcium concentration changes. We suggest that this mutant is in the low permeability state because altered charge on the C terminus induces an auto-inhibitory state, possibly because of an interaction between the N and C termini or within the C terminus. Second, the S235D mutant increases its water permeability either in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ or in the presence of CDZ (Fig. 3, A and C). According to in vitro CaM binding affinity assays, phosphorylation of serine 235 decreases the binding affinity (26Rose K.M. Wang Z. Magrath G.N. Hazard E.S. Hildebrandt J.D. Schey K.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). According to our results on S235D, CaM would still bind AQP0 perhaps in a secondary site with an altered configuration as was seen in in vitro cross-linking experiments (26Rose K.M. Wang Z. Magrath G.N. Hazard E.S. Hildebrandt J.D. Schey K.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Alternatively, elevating Ca2+ to 5 mm may have effects not at all related to CaM binding, for example by increasing phosphorylation or calcium binding to an unknown intrinsic AQP0 site. Relation to Other Models of Pf Regulation—Although structural analysis of AQP0 has failed to reveal any gating mechanism, it seems likely that addition of a regulatory protein, in this case CaM, can locally alter the properties of the pore. We previously suggested that acid pH modulates the orientation of water molecules by histidine residues near the outer vestibule and that Ca2+, through the mediation of CaM, modulates their orientation in the inner vestibular site (16Németh-Cahalan K.L. Hall J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6777-6782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We then showed that zinc induces a functional cooperativity among AQP0 subunits, presumably by inducing a conformational change of the entire tetramer (18Németh-Cahalan K.L. Kalman K. Froger A. Hall J.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Varadaraj et al. (19Varadaraj K. Kumari S. Shiels A. Mathias R.T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) suggested that the C terminus of AQP0, with a net of four positive charges and nine hydrophobic amino acids, is also likely to bind to the inside surface of the plasma membrane. Thus, membrane charge effects may also exert an influence on the interaction between CaM and AQP0. Implications for Lens Physiology—We have demonstrated unequivocal regulation of AQP0 water permeability in the oocyte expression system, a result that suggests that regulation of AQP0 water permeability is probably essential for normal function of the lens. In vivo evidence that this is so is compelling but somewhat indirect. The effect of the CatFr (cataract Fraser) mouse strain mutation on AQP0 water permeability can account for the unexpectedly severe cataract in the CatFr WT heterozygote and for the limited rescue of the cataract in a transgenic expressing AQP0 on the CatFr background (15Kalman K. Németh-Cahalan K.L. Froger A. Hall J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Coexpression of the defective AQP0-LTR abolishes the Ca2+ regulation of AQP0 water permeability in oocytes and probably also in the CatFr transgenic, suggesting that it is the loss of calcium regulation that accounts for the severity of the phenotype. Additional circumstantial evidence for the likely importance of calcium regulation of water permeability comes from a naturally occurring mutation in the CaM binding domain of AQP0, R233K. This mutation, found in six generations of a Chinese family, produces a binocular congenital cataract (32Lin H. Hejtmancik J.F. Qi Y. Mol. Vis. 2007; 13: 1822-1827PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it seems very likely that calcium regulation of water permeability, particularly as modulated by CaM and C terminus phosphorylation, is critical in maintaining lens transparency. In pathological conditions, when phosphorylation may be hyperactive, inappropriate water permeability without calcium regulation could contribute to the development of a cataract. We thank Dr. Michael Cahalan for critical readings of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2092488180,"α-Parvin is an essential component of focal adhesions (FAs), which are large multiprotein complexes that link the plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton. α-Parvin contains two calponin homology (CH) domains and its C-terminal CH2 domain binds multiple targets including paxillin LD motifs for regulating the FA network and signaling. Here we describe the solution structure of α-parvin CH2 bound to paxillin LD1. We show that although CH2 contains the canonical CH-fold, a previously defined N-terminal linker forms an α-helix that packs unexpectedly with the C-terminal helix of CH2, resulting in a novel variant of the CH domain. Importantly, such packing generates a hydrophobic surface that recognizes the Leu-rich face of paxillin-LD1, and the binding pattern differs drastically from the classical paxillin-LD binding to four-helix bundle proteins such as focal adhesion kinase. These results define a novel modular recognition mode and reveal how α-parvin associates with paxillin to mediate the FA assembly and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2022569965,"Benzoyl-CoA reductases (BCRs) are key enzymes of anaerobic aromatic metabolism in facultatively anaerobic bacteria. The highly oxygen-sensitive enzymes catalyze the ATP-dependent reductive de-aromatization of the substrate, yielding cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA (1,5-dienoyl-CoA). In extracts from anaerobically grown denitrifying Thauera aromatica, we detected a benzoate-induced, benzoyl-CoA-forming, 1,5-dienoyl-CoA:acceptor oxidoreductase activity. This activity co-purified with BCR but could be partially separated from it by hydroxyapatite chromatography. After activity staining on native gels, a monomeric protein with a subunit molecular weight of M(r) 76,000 was identified. Mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic digests identified peptides from NADH oxidases/2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductases/""old yellow"" enzymes. The UV-visible spectrum of the enriched enzyme suggested the presence of flavin and Fe/S-cofactors, and it was bleached upon the addition of 1,5-dienoyl-CoA. The enzyme had a high affinity for dioxygen as electron acceptor (K(m) = 10 microm) and therefore is referred to as 1,5-dienoyl-CoA oxidase (DCO). The likely product formed from dioxygen reduction was H(2)O. DCO was highly specific for 1,5-dienoyl-CoA (K(m) = 27 microm). The initial rate of DCO followed a Nernst curve with half-maximal activity at +10 mV. We propose that DCO provides protection for the extremely oxygen-sensitive BCR enzyme when the bacterium degrades aromatic compounds at the edge of steep oxygen gradients. The redox-dependent switch in DCO guarantees that DCO is only active during oxidative stress and circumvents futile de-aromatization/re-aromatization reactions catalyzed by BCR and DCO."

The program involves-besides proliferation-cell dissociation, motility and invasiveness, controlled by intracellular signals impinging on PI3K and on the small G-proteins of the Rac/Rho family. The mechanism(s) unbalancing Rac/Rho activation are still not completely clarified. Here, we describe a functional link between HGF and Arhgap12, a gene encoding a previously uncharacterized protein of the RhoGAP family. We identified Arhgap12 as a transcriptional target of HGF, through a novel gene trapping strategy. We found that Arhgap12 mRNA and protein are robustly suppressed by HGF treatment, but not by serum. Arhgap12 displayed GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity towards Rac1 and, upon overexpression, impaired cell scattering, invasion and adhesion to fibronectin in response to HGF. Consistently, Arhgap12 silencing by RNA interference selectively increased the scatter and adhesion responses. These data show that HGF-driven invasive growth involves transcriptional regulation of a Rac1-specific GAP."

This regulatory mechanism may be unique for CIS, as similar mutations in SOCS1, -2, -3, -6, and -7 had no functional impact.

The SH2 domain is the main determinant of target recognition by the SOCS proteins as it mediates interaction with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on their specific substrates (16Narazaki M.

In this way, SOCS proteins can suppress signaling by direct competition with signaling molecules for the phosphorylated recruitment sites.

Finally, SOCS proteins can suppress signaling through proteolytic degradation of the activated receptor complexes.

The functional significance of the association of Elongin B/C with the SOCS box is complex, however, as the SOCS box may also target SOCS proteins themselves for proteasomal degradation (21Zhang J.G.

Therefore, it is assumed that Elongin B/C binding has a double-edged effect on SOCS proteins: a degrading role by the link with the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex but also a protective function by prevention of proteasomal turnover of the SOCS molecules themselves. There is also evidence that the SOCS box is involved in a SOCS cross-modulatory mechanism, as some SOCS members like SOCS2 can act as negative regulators of other SOCS proteins by targeting them for proteasomal turnover (28Tannahill G.M.

In this report, we investigated the effect of Elongin B/C binding on CIS function in greater detail. Notably, we found that Elongin B/C recruitment by CIS is crucial for interaction with its receptor substrates and subsequent inhibition of STAT5 activity.

For transfection experiments, HEK293-T cells were freshly seeded in 6-wells plates and transfected overnight with ∼2.5 μg of plasmid DNA using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedure. The pMET7-SVT construct was used to normalize for the amount of transfected DNA and loading of the transcriptional and translational machinery. The next day, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to a 96-well plate, and left untreated or stimulated with ligand for at least 24 h. Recombinant mouse leptin and human erythropoietin were purchased from R&D Systems. Luciferase activity from triplicate samples was measured by chemiluminescence in a TopCount luminometer (Canberra-Packard) and expressed as -fold induction (stimulated/nonstimulated). Ba/F3 cells were grown in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Cambrex Corp.) and 1 ng/ml mIL-3 (Biogen). Transfection of the cell line was done by electroporation (300 V, 1500 microfarads). 48 h after transfection cells were simultaneously starved (serum and mIL-3 removed) for 24 h and stimulated with 1 ng/ml mIL-3 overnight. Activation of the pGL2-SPI2.1-luciferase reporter was measured with the Topcount luminometer (Canberra-Packard). Western Blot Analysis and Co-immunoprecipitation—Transfected HEK293-T cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.05% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. 5× loading buffer (156 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to the cell lysates, which were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blotting efficiency was checked by Ponceau S staining (Sigma). FLAG-tagged (corresponding to the peptide tag DYKDDDDK) and E-tagged (corresponding to the peptide tag GAPVPYPDPLEPR) proteins were revealed using, respectively, monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) and monoclonal anti-E-tag antibody (GE Healthcare). Polyclonal rabbit anti-CIS, goat anti-Elongin C, and rabbit anti-JAK2 were supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Western blot analysis was performed using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor) following the manufacturer's guidelines. In brief, blots were blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor), then probed overnight with the appropriated antibodies diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer with 0.1% Tween 20, and finally incubated with an IRDye 700 donkey anti-goat, IRDye 800 goat anti-mouse, or IRDye 800 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Li-Cor). For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments ∼6 × 106 HEK293-T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged or E-tagged expression vectors using the calcium phosphate transfection procedure and lysed after 48 h in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and incubated with 4 μg/ml anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or anti E-tag mouse monoclonal antibody (GE Healthcare) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, interactions were detected by immunoblotting using the appropriate antibody. (Phospho)peptide Affinity Chromatography—Approximately 2×107 HEK293-T cells transiently transfected as indicated were lysed in 5 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0, 5% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm NaF, Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and loaded on a pre-column with Sepharose 4B beads and streptavidin-agarose to prevent nonspecific interactions. Precleared lysates were then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the (phospho)tyrosine peptides as indicated coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads through their biotin group. The beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer and resuspended in 2× loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol). Specific protein binding was revealed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the anti-FLAG antibody. The sequences of the peptides used were biotin-EGASAASFEY(P) TILDPSSQL for Tyr402 in EpoR and biotin-QRQPSVKY(P) ATLVSNDK for Tyr985 in the leptin receptor (LR). Synthesis and purification of the biotinylated (phospho)tyrosine peptides and coupling to streptavidin-agarose beads was described previously (48Eyckerman S. Broekaert D. Verhee A. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Pulse-Chase Analysis—HEK293-T cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of plasmid DNA using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedure. At 40 h after transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h in Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Cells were then pulsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.15 mCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min and chased by incubation in unlabeled medium for various times. Cells were lysed in buffer (1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5), and the amount of 35S-labeled protein was determined by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG tag antibodies coupled to Sepharose (M2 beads, Sigma) followed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Detection and quantification was carried out using a phosphoimager (Typhoon) and associated software. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Approximately 108 Ba/F3 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-3 for 1 h at 37 °C and lysed in 3-ml lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 0.875% Brij 97 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.125% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Pefabloc, and protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, quantified using the Bradford method, and applied to a calibrated Superdex 75 PG16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) run by an advanced protein purification system apparatus (APPS; Waters). The running buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation of equal volumes of collected fractions, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies.

Extraction and Fractionation of C. planorbis Venom—Snails were collected in Cebu and Marinduque Islands, Philippines, and dissected. Venom was pressed out of freshly dissected venom ducts that were kept on ice. Venom pooled from several snails was lyophilized and stored at –70 °C. A 500-mg portion was resuspended in 35 ml of 30% acetonitrile and 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid using a Vortex mixer for 2× 1 min with an interval of 5 min on ice. The mixture was sonicated using a Branson LS-75 probe for 3× 0.5 min on ice with 1-min rest periods, and the sediment was pelleted in a Beckman Avanti centrifuge with an F650 rotor. Centrifugation was done for 30 min at 37,500 × g. The supernatant was diluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, centrifuged again to remove all residual particles, and applied to a preparative Vydac C18 high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) column (2.5 × 25 cm). Venom peptides were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 4.5–90% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 0.9% acetonitrile/min. The flow rate was 20 ml/min, and the absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 220 nm. An analytical Vydac C18 HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm) with a linear gradient at 0.45% acetonitrile/min in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was used for subfractionation. Bioassay of HPLC Fractions on Nereis virens—Specimens (usually within 10–16 cm long) of N. virens were maintained in seawater at 0–4 °C in a cold room. During injections, the worms were taken outside the cold room in individual beakers containing cold seawater. The temperature was maintained close to 4 °C by keeping the beakers immersed in iced water. Each worm was laid out on a block of Styrofoam right before injection and returned to cold seawater within a few seconds after injection. Lyophilized samples resuspended in 10–12 μl of normal saline solution were injected using an insulin syringe at the anterior end of the worm. A needle lid with the tip cut off was used to obtain a consistent depth of needle puncture of ∼1.5 mm. The initial effects of injections were evaluated by transferring the worms to seawater at room temperature for 5–15 s at ∼1 h after injection. These were observed side by side with saline-injected controls continuously for at least 4 h and checked every day for at least 2 weeks. Characterization of Peptides—Samples were completely reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 65 °C for 15 min and completely alkylated using 0.7% 4-vinylpyridine for 20 min in the dark at room temperature. Alkylation reactions were diluted 10-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and fractionated in an analytical C18 HPLC column. Elution was done with a linear gradient of 1.8% acetonitrile/min in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peptide sequencing by Edman degradation chemistry was done on alkylated samples after HPLC purification. Uncertain readings of C-terminal residues were verified by sequencing of fragments obtained after endopeptidase digestion with Arg-C. The reaction conditions for enzyme digestion were as recommended by the supplier (Roche Diagnostics). Mass determinations on both native and synthetic peptides were done by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization or electrospray ionization mass spectrometry at the University of Utah Mass Spectrometry and Proteomic Core Facility, the Salk Institute Peptide Biology Lab, and The University of Queensland Institute for Molecular Bioscience. Chemical Synthesis and Purification of CPY-Pl1 and CPY-Fe1—CPY-Pl1 and CPY-Fe1 were synthesized on an ABI 433 peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following the FastMoc chemistry procedure from ABI. Standard protecting groups for the amino acid side chains were used. The cleaved peptide was further purified by HPLC on a semi-preparative C18 column with a linear gradient of 0.18% acetonitrile/min in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was 2.5 ml/min, and absorbance at 220 and 280 nm was monitored. NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for 1H NMR measurements contained ∼2 mm peptide in 90% H2O and 10% D2O (v/v) at ∼pH 3 or 20% TFE, 80% H2O, and 10% D2O. Spectra were recorded at 288–298 K on a Bruker ARX-600 spectrometer equipped with a shielded gradient unit. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded in phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase incrementation for quadrature detection in the t1 dimension as described previously for other disulfide-rich peptides (10Daly N.L.

Spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo Workstation using XWINNMR software (Bruker). The t1 dimension was zero-filled to 1024 real data points, and 90° phase-shifted sine bell window functions were applied prior to Fourier transformation. Chemical shifts were referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. NMR spectral assignments for CPY-Pl1 were made using established techniques (12Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Bioassay of Synthetic Samples in Mice and C. elegans—Intracranial injections were administered to mice (Swiss Webster) that were 15–17 days old. Peptide samples in HPLC solutions were lyophilized, resuspended in 12 μl of normal saline solution, and administered intracranially to mice using an insulin syringe. The peptide-injected mice were observed side by side with saline-injected controls continuously for 2–4 h and checked the next day. Microinjection of peptide samples into the pseudocoelomic region of the nematode C. elegans was done as described (13Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stirchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2959-3970Crossref Scopus (2453) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—The Xenopus oocyte expression system was used to study the effect of the CPY peptides on K+ and Na+ channels (14Zhang M. Green B.R. Caitlin P. Fiedler B. Azam L. Chadwick A.

In K+ channel assays, oocytes were treated, and channels were expressed as described (16Jacobsen R.B. Koch E.D. Lang-Malecki B. Stocker M. Verhey J. van Wagoner R.M. Vyazovkina A. Olivera B.M.

Whole cell currents were recorded at room temperature (19–22 °C) under two-electrode voltage-clamp control using an 0C-725C amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) or a Turbo-Tec amplifier (npi electronic GmbH, Tamm, Germany). Current records were low pass-filtered at 3 kHz and sampled at 10 or 1 kHz (–3 db) and sampled at 4 kHz. The bath solution was normal frog Ringer's (17Horton R.M. Manfredi A.A. Conti-Tronconi B.M. Neurology. 1993; 43: 983-986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2). Bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) was added to the bath solution in all the dose-response experiments. The IC50 values for block of the Kv1.6 channel were calculated from the peak currents at a test potential of 20 or 0 mV according to IC50 = fc/(1– fc) × [Tx], where fc is the fractional current and [Tx] is the toxin concentration. Cloning—Total RNA preparations from a single duct each of C. planorbis and C. ferrugineus (Fig. 1) were obtained using the Qiagen RNeasy mini prep protocol for isolation of total RNA from animal tissues. Each RNA preparation (4.5 μg for C. planorbis and 5.1 μg for C. ferrugineus) was used in cDNA synthesis (18Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 28-45Google Scholar). Degenerate primers derived from CPY-Pl1 and CPY-Fe1 sequences were utilized in 3′-RACE (18Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 28-45Google Scholar) and 5′-RACE (SMART RACE, Clontech) experiments on C. planorbis cDNA. Oligonucleotide primers designed from the signal sequence identified for CPY-Pl1 were used in 3′-RACE (18Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 28-45Google Scholar) on C. planorbis and C. ferrugineus cDNAs. All PCR runs were done in a PTC-200 Peltier thermal cycler (MJ Research, Inc., Waltham, MA) using high fidelity Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) was used for all transformations. DNA sequencing was done at the University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute Protein/DNA Core Facility using samples prepared following the Qiagen mini prep kit protocol. Isolation of CPY Peptides from the Venom of C. planorbis (9Imperial, J. S. (2007) Novel Peptides from Conus planorbis, Terebra subulata, and Hastula hectica. Ph.D. thesis, The University of QueenslandGoogle Scholar)—Crude C. planorbis venom was fractionated by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Biological activity on the marine worm N. virens was used to identify active fractions from the preparative HPLC column (Fig. 2A) and to guide further subfractionation (Fig. 2B). Aliquots of the fractions and subfractions were pooled, lyophilized, and assayed on N. virens as described under “Experimental Procedures”; if a pool showed bioactivity as described below, individual fractions were assayed. The fraction indicated in Fig. 2A gave characteristic symptoms when injected into N. virens. Worms that had not been injected or those injected with the control solution (normal saline solution) would move in energetic S-like patterns when transferred to seawater at room temperature. In contrast, affected worms did not move in S-like patterns, but would just glide or move very slowly. All injected worms were moved back to cold seawater after 5–15 s of observation in seawater at room temperature; worms that manifested the initial symptomatology eventually became weak or died in 1–5 days. Uninjected and control worms survived for months. The subfractions in Fig. 2B were assayed individually, and one peak exhibited the activity on N. virens described above. The active peak in Fig. 2B was completely reduced and alkylated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reduced and alkylated material was fractionated by HPLC (Fig. 2C); the earlier eluting peak indicated by the arrow is CPY-Pl1, and the later eluting peak is CPY-Fe1. The peptides were sequenced using standard Edman methods. The peptide sequences obtained had a most striking sequence feature: an unusually high frequency of tyrosine residues, in addition to basic and hydrophobic residues. The sequences of the two peptides are shown in Fig. 3; the monoisotopic masses of 4092.1 and 4040.1 Da that were obtained corresponded to the respective calculated masses for CPY-Pl1 and CPY-Fe1. Sixteen of the 30 residues are identical in the two peptides, including five tyrosine residues. The high content of tyrosine in CPY-Pl1 and CPY-Fe1 is reminiscent of the vertebrate neuropeptide Y family (see Fig. 3); we refer to these peptides as the conopeptide Y or CPY family. We propose to name these CPY family peptides from Conus venoms using the following nomenclature. The individual peptides will be indicated by the first two letters of the species name, followed by a number representing the numerical sequence of peptides that belong to this family from each species. The two Tyr-rich peptides isolated from what was presumed to be C. planorbis venom are referred to as CPY-Fe1 (Fe for ferrugineus) and CPY-Pl1 (Pl for planorbis). Results from cloning, described below, suggest that both C. ferrugineus and C. planorbis venoms were present in the sample labeled “pooled C. planorbis venom” that was used. Because of the close resemblance of shells of the two species (Fig. 1), the mistaken identification of one species for the other was highly probable during the period that specimens were accumulated to prepare the pooled crude venom that yielded the purified peptides. Chemical Synthesis of CPY Peptides—The chemical synthesis of the CPY peptides was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The HPLC chromatograms for the coelution of synthetic CPY-Fe1 and CPY-Pl1 with the respective native samples are shown in Fig. 4 (upper and lower) (9Imperial, J. S. (2007) Novel Peptides from Conus planorbis, Terebra subulata, and Hastula hectica. Ph.D. thesis, The University of QueenslandGoogle Scholar). The isotopic peaks in the mass spectra of both synthetic peptides matched those in the spectra of the native samples. NMR Spectroscopy—The secondary shifts of CPY-Pl1 in aqueous solution and in 20% TFE are shown in Fig. 5. In general, analysis of αH chemical shifts of peptides can provide a strong indication of the type of secondary structure present. For CPY-Pl1 in aqueous solution, the chemical shifts suggest that no regular secondary structure is present based on the lack of stretches of consistent positive or negative secondary shifts. However, in the presence of TFE, a series of significant (i.e. >0.1 ppm) negative deviations from random coil shifts between residues 12 and 18 suggest the presence of helical structure in this region. TFE is commonly reported to stabilize helical structures in peptides having an intrinsic helical tendency, and this appears to be the case for CPY-Pl1. Bioassay of CPY-Fe1 Using Mice and C. elegans—Mice were injected intracranially with CPY-Fe1. Mice injected with ∼0.7 nmol of peptide/g of mouse exhibited only mild symptoms such as slightly more than usual grooming, climbing, or hyperactivity. An attempt to elicit more definitive symptomatology by dropping the metal lid onto the cage, thereby creating a loud acoustic input, caused a 30-s seizure in a mouse injected with ∼1.5 nmol of peptide/g of mouse. A surprising effect was elicited when one peptide-injected mouse was accidentally dropped while being transferred between two cages; not only was a seizure elicited, but death occurred within 10–15 s after the seizure was initiated. The seizures were observed within 2–3 min after the drop. Thus, we routinely carried out a test referred to as “the mouse-drop assay” after all succeeding mouse intracranial injections of the CPY peptides. Injected mice were dropped from a height of ∼1.5 ft onto the cage bottom starting at ∼3–5 min after injection. This was repeated every 5–10 min up to ∼30 min after injection. The seizure response to the mouse drop was usually observed after the first drop. No symptoms were observed in normal saline solution-injected controls or unaffected mice, even after four to six drops within the 30-min period after injection. Both peptides induced seizures with the mouse-drop assay. The dose response was determined for the CPY-Fe1 peptide. At a dose of 5 nmol, ∼50% of the mice responded with mild to moderate seizures. With 20 nmol injected per mouse, most of the mice developed severe seizures and died. Microinjections in C. elegans were made at a dose of ∼10 pmol of CPY-Fe1/worm. Partial paralysis, which lasted for ∼20 min, was observed in four of four worms injected. In three of the four worms, paralysis occurred from the midsection to the posterior end; the fourth worm showed paralysis from the midsection to the anterior end. An initial test on the effect of CPY-Fe1 on the biphasic contractile response of electrically stimulated rat prostatic vas deferens (19Sharpe I.A. Gehrmann J. Loughnan M.L. Thomas L. Adams D.A. Atkins A. Palant E. Craik D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) did not show any effect on both noradrenaline- and ATP-mediated responses with 10 μm CPY-Fe1. Electrophysiology—Initial screening for activity using CPY-Fe1 on channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes included Kv1.1 to Kv1.6, Kv2.1, Kv3.4, and Nav1.2. In these experiments, the oocytes used were free of the vitelline membrane (“skinned”) during the clamping experiments. CPY-Fe1 was found to be active at 1 μm on Kv1.6. When attempts were made to determine IC50 values with skinned oocytes, evidence for high affinity block of Kv1.6 was obtained for both peptides. However, there were technical problems using skinned oocytes; these invariably developed a leak current after a variable length of time as the measurements were being made. Thus, it was not feasible to obtain reproducible quantitative measurements using skinned oocytes. The dose responses for both CPY-Fe1 and CPY-Pl1 (Fig. 6) demonstrate that CPY-Pl1 is more potent on the Kv1.6 subtype. The data shown in Table 1 and Fig. 6 were obtained using unskinned Xenopus oocytes; the kinetics were slow and took tens of minutes to reach equilibrium. Table 1 presents the IC50 values obtained from dose-response experiments in oocytes expressing Kv1.2 to Kv1.6. CPY-Pl1 is more active than CPY-Fe1 on both Kv1.2 (>15-fold) and Kv1.6 (∼50-fold). In further assays using unskinned oocytes, CPY-Pl1 (1 μm) inhibited ∼15% of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NR1–3b/NR2A and NR1–3b/NR2B) activity and ∼30% of the Nav1.2 activity.TABLE 1Activity of CPY peptides on mammalian Kv1 isoforms expressed in Xenopus oocytesPeptideIC50 (95% confidence interval)Kv1.2Kv1.3Kv1.4Kv1.5Kv1.6μmCPY-Fe1>30>50>50>508.8 (6.5-12.0)CPY-Pl12.0 (1.0-3.9)>50>50>50.17 (0.16-0.19) Open table in a new tab Molecular Cloning: Definition of the CPY Family—A cDNA library made from C. planorbis venom ducts was used to identify the precursors of the CPY peptides. The predicted open reading frame including signal sequence, propeptide, and mature peptide is shown in Fig. 7. The cleavage site between the signal peptide, MMSKLGVVLFVFLLLLPLAAP, and the propeptide was predicted through the SignalP 3.0 server (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). Initial 3′-RACE experiments utilizing C. planorbis cDNA and oligonucleotide primers derived from both peptides yielded clones (7/7) for CPY-Pl1 but no clones for CPY-Fe1. Clones (6/6) obtained in 5′-RACE experiments for both CPY peptides on C. planorbis cDNA using primers from both peptides gave the CPY-Pl1 precursor even with the primer derived from CPY-Fe1, which has a region homologous to the primer derived from CPY-Pl1. A 3′-RACE experiment on C. planorbis cDNA utilizing oligonucleotide primers derived from the signal sequence gave CPY-Pl1 clones (7/7) up to the poly(A) tail. A screen for CPY peptides in C. ferrugineus cDNA using one of the primers derived from the signal sequence and the poly(T)-containing QT primer (18Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 28-45Google Scholar) gave clones (4/4) for CPY-Fe1. The signal and propeptide sequences are completely shared by the two peptides up to the nucleotide level. Sixteen (Fig. 7) of the 30 residues of the mature peptide are also shared up to the nucleotide level. There is 91% homology in the 3′-untranslated regions of CPY-Fe1 (EU000529) and CPY-Pl1 (EU000528). The unique signal sequence revealed from clones encoding precursors of these peptides defines a new gene family of conopeptides, which we refer to as the conopeptide Y or CPY family. The peptides characterized in this study are unusual in their high content of tyrosine, normally an uncommon amino acid. Most Conus venom peptides are stabilized by multiple disulfide bonds. As a rule, the Conus venom peptides that lack disulfide cross-links tend to be smaller in size than the disulfide-rich conotoxins. The CPY peptides that are characterized here are the longest conopeptides without disulfides shown to be biologically active. In addition to the high tyrosine content, these peptides are enriched in arginine and large hydrophobic residues (Phe, Leu, and Ile); in CPY-Pl1, these five amino acids account for >70% of the total. Both CPY-Fe1 and CPY-Pl1 were isolated (9Imperial, J. S. (2007) Novel Peptides from Conus planorbis, Terebra subulata, and Hastula hectica. Ph.D. thesis, The University of QueenslandGoogle Scholar) from a batch of venom that had been assumed to have come from specimens of C. planorbis. The cloning results strongly indicated, however, that one of the CPY peptides that was isolated from the pooled venom, CPY-Fe1, could be cloned only from cDNA derived from a C. ferrugineus venom duct. Correspondingly, only CPY-Pl1 clones (20/20) were detected from C. planorbis cDNA. As shown in Fig. 1, there are shells of C. ferrugineus or C. planorbis that could easily be confused as one or the other; indeed, the precise taxonomy of the complex of species related to C. planorbis remains unresolved. Each cDNA preparation was obtained from a single venom duct of each species; thus, the cloning results seem more reliable than those obtained by extraction from venom pooled from 100 or so specimens. We have demonstrated that these peptides are antagonists of voltage-gated K+ channels belonging to the Kv1 subfamily. Both of the peptides characterized exhibited selectivity for Kv1.6 among the Kv1 subfamily channels tested, with CPY-Pl1 showing submicromolar affinity (IC50 = 0.17 μm). Conopeptides derived from venoms of worm-hunting Conus species (such as C. planorbis) generally tend to show lower affinity for mammalian homologs than do the corresponding conopeptides from venoms of fish-hunting cone snails; thus, the data are not inconsistent with the native target of this peptide being the Kv1.6 homolog in the polychaete worm prey of C. planorbis. Another possibility is that an even higher affinity K+ channel target will be found in mammalian systems as well as in polychaetes. The data in Table 1 suggesting that these peptides have a higher affinity for Kv1.6 but also target Kv1.2 with lower affinity raise the possibility that the native target is a heteromeric combination of subunits (such as an interface between Kv1.6 and Kv1.2). Thus, selectivity for a heteromeric Kv1 target that has more than one type of subunit is also a viable possibility that needs to be considered. The variable onset of leak currents in skinned oocytes suggests that, in addition to the K+ channel blocking activity, the CPY peptides may also be membrane-active. Because these are hydrophobic peptides, the possibility that they can insert into membranes to form pores or destabilize the oocyte membranes in some other manner could explain the unpredictable leak observed; in contrast, the unskinned oocytes remained stable enough so that the reliable dose-response data shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1 could be obtained. A small peptide lacking disulfides that inhibited voltage-gated K+ channels was reported previously from Conus monile; the subfamily selectivity was not reported (20Sudarslal S. Singaravadivelan G. Ramasamy P. Ananda K. Sarma S.P. Sikdar S.K. Krishnan K.S. P.??? B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The CPY peptide that has been most well characterized, CPY-Pl1, is highly selective for the Kv1.6 subtype. It is notable that CPY-Pl1 is ∼18-fold more potent on Kv1.6 than pl14a, a disulfide-rich peptide that was isolated previously from the same venom (9Imperial, J. S. (2007) Novel Peptides from Conus planorbis, Terebra subulata, and Hastula hectica. Ph.D. thesis, The University of QueenslandGoogle Scholar, 21Imperial J.S. Bansal P.S. Alewood P.F. Daly N.L.

Surprisingly, when Kv1 channel-targeted peptides from two other clades of fish-hunting cones were elucidated, peptides structurally unrelated to κ-conotoxin PVIIA were found: κM-conotoxin RIIIK (23Al-Sabi A.

The investigation of C. planorbis venom revealed not only K+ channel-targeted peptides unrelated to the three classes above but also two different toxins unrelated to each other that both preferentially target Kv1.6: κJ-conotoxin PlXIVA, a peptide with two disulfide bonds and previously called pl14a (9Imperial, J.

It is not unprecedented for venom from one species to contain unrelated peptides that antagonize the same ion channel complex. It has been previously shown that different peptides antagonize the same nicotinic receptor subtype in C. purpurascens (26Hopkins C. Grilley M. Miller C. Shon K. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. Dykert J.

McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 757-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) venoms. In both cases, the peptides were structurally unrelated and were subsequently shown to target different pharmacological sites on the same receptor complex. This appears to be part of the sophisticated combination drug therapy strategy that cone snails employ for prey paralysis. We speculate that the natural prey of C. planorbis has a Kv1.6-like Shaker-type K+ channel that may be an important molecular target in the snail's strategy for prey capture. Multiple disulfide cross-links presumably stabilize most Conus peptides once they are injected into the body of the targeted animal. Because the CPY peptides are unstructured in aqueous solution, they would appear to be subject to rapid proteolytic degradation. However, a significant number of Conus peptide toxins may target axons right at the site of injection; in the case of fish-hunting cone snails, K+ channel blockers are part of the “lightning-strike cabal” of toxins that cause a massive depolarization of axons in the immediate vicinity of the injection site, which in effect rapidly immobilizes the prey. It seems reasonable to speculate that the CPY peptides in C. planorbis and C. ferrugineus venoms may play an analogous role in vivo; if this were the case, the peptides may act right at the injection site and, once bound to their targets, would presumably become much more highly structured and resistant to attack by proteases.

A genomic profile was performed in a monkey model of MI, from the myocardium adjacent to chronic (2-month) MI followed by 3 weeks of pacing to develop HF. The transcript of the gene encoding the cell cycle-related kinase (CCRK) was down-regulated by 50% in HF heart compared with control (p < 0.05), which was confirmed by quantitative PCR. The CCRK sequence cloned from a heart library showed a conservation of the N-terminal kinase domain when compared with the “generic” isoform cloned previously but a different C-terminal half due to alternative splicing with frameshift.

Because the fully differentiated cardiac myocyte has a limited capacity for regeneration, most forms of heart disease, including ischemic heart disease and heart failure (HF), 2The abbreviations used are: HFheart failureCCRKcell cycle-related kinaseMImyocardial infarctionDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. 2The abbreviations used are: HFheart failureCCRKcell cycle-related kinaseMImyocardial infarctionDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. are characterized by a loss of cardiomyocytes (1Narula J.

Therefore, deciphering the molecular mechanisms balancing cell growth and apoptosis may help develop strategies to improve the prognosis of both ischemic heart disease and HF, particularly with regard to stem cell therapy (4Anversa P.

Our previous studies have shown that genomic profiling in large mammalian models of heart disease allows the detection of novel potential candidates to promote cardiac cell growth and survival in a context of reversible ischemia or pressure overload (5Depre C.

In the present study, we extended this investigation to a model of postischemic cardiomyopathy in monkeys. We reasoned that a nonhuman primate model would be ideal, since it is phylogenetically and genetically closer to humans. Genomic profile by DNA microarrays in that model revealed the down-regulation of the cell cycle-related kinase (CCRK) after development of HF. Although this protein has not been characterized in the heart before, it is known that CCRK plays a major role in promoting the growth of cancer cells (7Caligiuri M. Becker F. Murthi K. Kaplan F.

CCRK belongs to the family of cyclin-dependent protein kinase-activating kinases. A well characterized cyclin-dependent protein kinase-activating kinase is made of a complex that includes the catalytic subunit p40 MO15 (also called Cdk7 (cyclin-dependent kinase-7)), the regulatory subunit cyclin H, and the assembly factor MAT1 and activates the transcription factor IIH, which phosphorylates RNA polymerase II, as well as multiple components of the transcriptional machinery, including p53, RARα, and Oct-1 (7Caligiuri M.

CCRK is essential for the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2, a major regulator of the cell cycle (16Liu Y. Wu C. Galaktionov K. J. Biol.

Cells lacking CCRK were incapable of growth, whereas cells with a reduced level of CCRK grew at a significantly slower rate than control cells (7Caligiuri M. Becker F. Murthi K. Kaplan F. Dedier S.

Most interestingly, it was shown that a specific inhibition of CCRK promotes tumor cell death (7Caligiuri M. Becker F. Murthi K. Kaplan F. Dedier S. Kaufmann C. Machl A. Zybarth G. Richard J.

Our results demonstrate that the heart expresses a splice variant of CCRK, which differs from the “generic” isoform characterized in other tissues. The expression of the corresponding protein was confirmed upon generation of a monoclonal antibody. Overexpression of the cardiac CCRK in isolated cardiac myocytes promotes cardiac cell hypertrophy and survival. We also show that this cardiac variant differs from the generic isoform of CCRK in terms of developmental regulation, protein-protein interactions, substrate specificity, and regulation of the cell cycle. Monkey Model of HF—Male monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, age 4–6 years, 3–8 kg) were used. The biological and physiological characteristics of these monkeys have been reported before (17Qiu H. Depre C. Ghosh K. Resuello R.G. Natividad F.F. Rossi F. Peppas A. Shen Y.T. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Circulation. 2007; 116: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Qiu H. Tian B. Resuello R.G.

Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in five monkeys by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Instrumentation for measurement of left ventricular pressure and left ventricular dP/dt as well as for initiation of rapid right ventricular pacing was implanted. Eight weeks after infarction, monkeys underwent a 3-week protocol of pacing-induced (270 beats/min) HF. Sham monkeys (n = 5) were used as controls (control group). The transition into HF was confirmed by measurements of ventricular pressure and contractility. Myocardial samples were taken from left ventricular areas adjacent to the MI and were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Mouse Model of Ischemia/Reperfusion—Experiments were performed on anesthetized mice under ventilation. After chest opening, ischemia/reperfusion was induced by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery for 30 min, followed by 24 h of reperfusion, as described previously (19Depre C. Wang L. Sui X. Qiu H. Hong C. Hedhli N. Ginion A. Shah A. Pelat M. Bertrand L. Wagner T. Gaussin V. Vatner S.F. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Microarrays—Total RNA was extracted from about 300 mg of each monkey heart using the phenol/chloroform method (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). The concentration of RNA was measured spectrophotometrically by the absorbance at 260 nm. The procedure for RNA labeling was performed as described previously (19Depre C. Wang L. Sui X. Qiu H. Hong C. Hedhli N. Ginion A. Shah A. Pelat M. Bertrand L. Wagner T. Gaussin V. Vatner S.F. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of mRNA were used for first strand cDNA synthesis with the SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a T7-oligo(dT)24 primer. Second strand synthesis was performed with DNA polymerase I. Products were purified by Phase-Lock Gels/phenol-chloroform extraction. This DNA was subsequently transcribed into biotin-labeled synthetic antisense RNA, using the Bioarray RNA labeling kit (ENZO) with the T7 polymerase. Labeled cRNA was cleaned up (Qiagen), fragmented by alkaline treatment and hybridized to a GeneChip array overnight. Custom-made human genome chips (Center for Applied Genomics; University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey) printed with a probe set representing 19,000 different genes were used to detect differences of gene expression. All values from each array were normalized to the 75th percentile value of the array, which was arbitrarily set at 100. Selected probe sets were analyzed by Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 and -fold change greater than 1.2 (either up-regulated or down-regulated) were used to select probe sets whose intensity was considered significantly different between the two groups. Quantitative PCR—Specific primers and probes (derived with FAM and TAMRA) were designed. For each measurement, the mRNA of interest was reverse-transcribed from 60 ng of total RNA with the TaqMan RT kit (Applied Biosystems). The gene-specific cDNA was used for quantitative PCR (40 cycles of a 10-s step at 95 °C and a 1-min step at 60 °C) using the TaqMan PCR mix (Applied Biosystems) on a 7700 ABI-Prizm sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). Standards were prepared for each transcript of interest from its PCR-amplified cDNA after ligation of the T7 promoter (Ambion, Austin, TX) (21Depre C. Shipley G.L. Chen W. Han Q. Doenst T. Moore M.L. Stepkowski S. Davies P.J. Taegtmeyer H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Due to the variation in sample-to-sample loading conditions, the values of the transcripts were reported to the transcript level of cyclophilin, used as a housekeeping gene (17Qiu H. Depre C. Ghosh K. Resuello R.G. Natividad F.F. Rossi F. Peppas A. Shen Y.T. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Circulation. 2007; 116: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). CCRK Cloning and Sequencing—The coding sequence of CCRK was amplified by PCR from both human and mouse heart cDNA libraries and subcloned into pGEMTeasy (Promega). PCR products were sequenced by triple pass on a 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using the Big-Dye terminator (Applied Biosystems). Data analysis was performed with the ABI AutoAssembler software. Gene analysis and sequence comparisons were performed with the MacVector software. Generation of a Monoclonal Antibody against Cardiac CCRK—Two epitopes matching the cardiac CCRK protein sequence were designed and synthesized. One epitope corresponds to the N terminus, which is shared by the generic CCRK and the cardiac variant. The second epitope recognizes only the C terminus of the cardiac variant. Using this strategy, we can measure both the total expression of CCRK (using the N-terminal antibody) and the expression of the cardiac specific splice variant (C-terminal antibody). The synthetic peptides were injected in BALB/c mice and tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Spleen of positive mice was harvested and fused with myeloma cells for production of a monoclonal antibody. Immunoblotting—Tissues were homogenized at 4 °C in a lysis buffer (25 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 15 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol), supplemented with protease, kinase, and phosphatase inhibitors, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein extracts (20–40 μg) were denatured by boiling, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to membranes. Primary antibodies were added at the recommended dilution and incubated overnight. After washing and incubation with the secondary antibody, detection was performed by chemiluminescence. Generation of a CCRK Adenovirus—An adenovirus harboring either the coding sequence of the cardiac CCRK or of the generic CCRK was generated using the AdMax system (Clontech). The insert was subsequently digested and ligated downstream the cytomegalovirus promoter in a pCMV shuttle vector with loxP (pDC316) to tag the coding sequence with hemagglutinin at the N terminus (Clontech). The recombinant adenovirus was obtained in HEK293 cells by co-transfection of a cosmid (pBHGloxΔE1,3Cre) containing the adenovirus type 5 genome (devoid of E1 and E3) with the shuttle vector containing the hemagglutinin-tagged CCRK sequence. The viral titer was determined on HEK293 cells overlaid with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% equine serum and 0.5% agarose. Controls were performed with an adenovirus harboring the LacZ sequence. Cell Culture—Ventricular cardiac myocytes were prepared from 1-day-old Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories) (5Depre C. Hase M. Gaussin V. Zajac A. Wang L. Hittinger L. Ghaleh B. Yu X. Kudej R.K. Wagner T. Sadoshima J. Vatner S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), by digestion with 0.1% collagenase type IV (Sigma), 0.1% trypsin (Invitrogen), and 15 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma) (22Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell suspensions were applied on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (1.060/1.086 g/ml) made up in Ads buffer (116 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, pH 7.35) and spun at 1600 × g for 30 min. Myocytes were plated on gelatin-coated culture dishes at a density of 106 cells/cm2 and cultured in modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, 4 g/ml transferrin, 0.7 ng/ml sodium selenite (Invitrogen), 2 g/liter bovine serum albumin (fraction V), 3 mm pyruvic acid, 15 mm HEPES, 100 μm ascorbic acid, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 5 μg/ml linoleic acid, and 100 μm 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma). After 24 h, myocytes were cultured in serum-free conditions for 48 h before infection. To measure cell survival, the infected myocytes were treated with 6 μm chelerythrine for 30 min or with 100 μm H2O2 for 24 h, after which the cells were fixed in 10% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline three times, and then incubated in 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 μmol/liter EGTA for 20 min at room temperature. DNA 3′-end labeling was performed using the biotin-16-dUTP/TdT system followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-ExtrAvidin staining. The average number of myocyte nuclei per ×20 objective field was determined by manual counting of DAPI-stained nuclei using UV excitation. At the same magnification, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling-positive myocytes were counted. To measure cell growth, infected cells were scraped with 1 ml of 1× standard sodium citrate containing 0.25% SDS and vortexed extensively. The total cell protein and the DNA content were determined by the Lowry method and the Hoechst method, respectively. The protein content was normalized by the amount of DNA to correct for differences in cell number (23Sadoshima J. Jahn L. Takahashi T. Kulik T.J. Izumo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10551-10560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the reentry into the cell cycle, infected cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin and centrifuged at 1000 rpm, and the pellet was resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.2% saponin, and 50 μg/ml RNase (Sigma), followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan with fluorescence signals collected by a linear scale. Myocyte nucleation was measured on formalin-fixed myocytes after DAPI staining and counterstaining of cardiac cells by α-actinin. Myocyte surface area was measured on these preparations with the Image-ProPlus Software System (Silver Springs, MD). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Two constructs corresponding to the generic and the cardiac sequences of CCRK were designed as “baits” in a yeast two-hybrid system performed with the Matchmaker kit (Clontech) after ligation of each coding sequence in Trp/pGBKT7-Myc vector and subsequent transformation in the AH109 yeast strain. Selection was performed on -Trp standard medium. This strain was mated with a Y189 strain pretransformed with a human heart library ligated in Leu/pGAD-hemagglutinin vector (Clontech). Co-transformants were grown on -His/-Leu/-Trp (low stringency) and -Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp (high stringency) media (24Wang L. Zajac A. Hedhli N. Depre C. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2004; 265: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Positive clones were screened by sequencing. Positive interactions were verified upon co-transfection of plasmids harboring the Myc-tagged sequences of CCRK isoforms and a plasmid harboring the flagged sequence of the target protein. Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. We used Student's t test for two-group comparison. A value of p < 0.05 was considered as significant. Characteristics of the Model—A model of postischemic HF was developed in monkeys as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” MI was induced in five monkeys by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and HF was induced by subsequent pacing. The HF group presented the typical functional characteristics of HF, including a hypertrophy of the myocardial tissue resulting from volume overload (left ventricle/body weight: 1.9 ± 0.2 versus 2.6 ± 0.5 g/kg in controls and HF, respectively; p < 0.05), an increased filling pressure (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure: 5.0 ± 0.5 versus 25 ± 5 mm Hg, respectively; p < 0.05), and decreased contractility as measured by the left ventricular +dP/dt (5,000 ± 2,000 versus 1,500 ± 500 mm Hg/sec, respectively; p < 0.05). Cloning of the Cardiac CCRK Transcript—A custom-made DNA microarray showed that 1,259 genes were up-regulated in the HF group versus control, whereas 1,480 genes were down-regulated (supplemental Table 1). Table 1 summarizes the genes showing the highest amplitude of changes. Among these genes, CCRK (accession number NM_012119) showed one of the most significant changes, with an average down-regulation of 2-fold in HF samples versus controls (Table 1). To verify that CCRK expression is down-regulated in the HF group, we designed a specific set of TaqMan probe and primers for quantitative PCR analysis, based on the human generic sequence available in public data bases. However, no PCR amplification could be detected with this assay. This negative result could be due to a difference in the CCRK sequence between humans and monkeys or due to the fact that the heart expresses a different transcript compared with the generic transcript reported in public data bases. To address that problem, we cloned the CCRK coding sequence from both human and mouse cardiac cDNA libraries. Both libraries showed that the CCRK sequence expressed in heart presents a deletion in the central part of the transcript and a frameshift in its C-terminal half when compared with the generic sequence reported in public data bases, whereas the N-terminal half, which contains the kinase domain, is strictly identical between both forms (Fig. 1a). Cloning of CCRK in other mouse tissues, including the liver, confirmed the presence of the generic sequence reported in GenBank™ (not shown). Remarkably, the protein sequence deduced from the cloning of the cardiac transcript expressed in both human and mouse libraries is 100% identical (Fig. 1b), which supports an important role for this variant across species. BLAT alignment of the cardiac transcript with the generic sequence shows that the cardiac isoform lacks exon 3, supporting the conclusion that this isoform results from alternative splicing (Fig. 1c). The coding sequences of the cardiac CCRK obtained from mouse, monkey, and human libraries were deposited in GenBank™ (accession numbers AY904369, AY904368, and AY904367, respectively).TABLE 1Preliminary data from the genomic profileNameAccession numberMI/HF versus controlABCDEG protein-coupled receptor 25NM_005298–3.43–3.00–3.92–3.45–4.43KIAA0176 gene, partial cdsD79998–3.13–5.60–2.59–4.45–4.16Clone 24583 mRNA sequenceAF070595–1.21–2.11–2.20–3.27–1.36Rhodopsin homolog (RRH)NM_006583–2.68–5.08–4.50–4.38–4.52Human BENE mRNA, partial cdsU17077–1.66–1.49–3.49–2.24–1.04CCRKNM_012119–1.59–2.30–1.45–2.01–2.346-PhosphogluconolactonaseNM_012088–1.18–2.72–2.92–2.70–3.29 Open table in a new tab The lack of amplification by quantitative PCR was explained by the fact that this PCR assay was targeting exon 3. A new quantitative PCR assay was therefore developed based on the sequence cloned from heart libraries. Using that assay, CCRK gene expression could be detected and showed a significant 2-fold decrease in the HF versus control (Fig. 2). Therefore, the down-regulation of this gene in HF found by microarrays is confirmed by quantitative PCR, both techniques showing a similar -fold change. Characterization of the Cardiac CCRK Protein—Our next goal was to determine whether this alternative transcript of CCRK corresponds to a native protein. A specific monoclonal antibody was generated, which targets the C-terminal half of the cardiac CCRK. Another monoclonal antibody was designed to recognize the N-terminal half of the molecule, which is identical between both isoforms. As shown in Fig. 3a, there was only one band detected at an approximate size of 25 kDa when using the C-terminal antibody, which corresponds to the expected size of the novel cardiac variant of CCRK found in the cloning experiment. Two major bands were detected when using the N-terminal antibody (Fig. 3a), at the approximate sizes of 25 and 37 kDa, which corresponds to the size of the novel cardiac variant of CCRK (25 kDa) and of the generic form of CCRK (37 kDa). Using the C-terminal antibody, we were able to confirm the expression of the novel CCRK protein in the monkey heart (Fig. 3b). This isoform could also be detected in liver and kidney (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, it was not found in skeletal muscle, a tissue that shows extensive homology with the heart in terms of protein profile. Reciprocally, the generic form of CCRK was detected in a larger array of tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, testes, colon, and uterus (Fig. 3b). Using the C-terminal monoclonal antibody described above, we tested whether the protein corresponding to the cardiac isoform of CCRK shows the same regulation as the corresponding transcript during the transition into HF following MI. As shown in Fig. 3c, the expression of the cardiac CCRK protein was reduced by half in cardiac tissue samples from monkey subjected to HF when compared with control. Because we cloned the cardiac CCRK sequence from a mouse genome, we determined whether the protein would also be down-regulated in a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion. Mice were submitted to 30 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 24 h of reperfusion, after which CCRK expression was determined by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3d, the protein content was reduced by half (p < 0.05) in the ischemic murine myocardium, reproducing the findings in the monkey model. Therefore, both isoforms can be detected across species in the heart, and the cardiac CCRK shows a similar pattern of regulation after MI, both in rodents and in nonhuman primates. We determined next whether both isoforms of CCRK are expressed concomitantly in the heart at different stages of development. Rat hearts were harvested from neonatal pups (1 day old) and from animals aged 1 week and 1 month. Expression of both isoforms of CCRK was measured by Western blotting with the monoclonal antibody recognizing the N terminus of the protein. Both proteins could be detected in the heart but at different time points (Fig. 3e). The expression of the generic CCRK was predominant in the neonatal heart, whereas it decreased markedly after 1 month, as cardiac myocytes matured (Fig. 3e). Remarkably, the cardiac isoform showed a reciprocal pattern of expression (i.e. a very low level of expression in the neonatal tissue and a predominant expression in the mature heart) (Fig. 3e). Protein-Protein Interactions—We tested next whether the alternative splicing of the cardiac CCRK would modify the protein-protein interactions of the molecule. To answer that question, a yeast two-hybrid experiment was performed, using both the generic and the cardiac sequences as “baits” (Fig. 4a). Table 2 shows the potential interactions found for each isoform. Importantly, the clones obtained from the library mated with the generic CCRK showed a putative protein-protein interaction with casein kinase II and cyclin H, which was not found in the library mated with the cardiac CCRK (Table 2). These interactions were confirmed upon overexpression of the corresponding proteins in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 4b). The cells were transfected with an expression vector containing the flagged sequence of casein kinase II or cyclin H, together with an"

In this study we examined the effect of heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA), on IR-induced G2 arrest in human colon adenocarcinoma cells with different p53 status. We show that GA treatment abrogates IR-induced G2-phase arrest in cells null or mutant for p53. Specifically, GA treatment pushed irradiated p53 signaling-defective cells into a premature mitosis characterized by aberrant mitotic figures, increased γH2AX expression and formation of micronucleated cells. Cells expressing wild-type p53 were resistant to GA-induced G2 checkpoint abrogation. Notably, GA treatment decreased levels of G2 regulatory proteins Wee1 and Chk1, and inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2, independent of p53 status. Further investigation identified p21 as the potential downstream effector of p53 that mediates resistance to G2 checkpoint abrogation. Clonogenic survival studies demonstrated higher sensitivity to GA alone or combination IR plus GA treatment in p53 and p21-null cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate potential mechanisms through which HSP90 inhibition can enhance the effects of ionizing radiation in p53-compromised cancer cells. Combination IR plus HSP90 inhibitor therapies may be particularly useful in treating cancers that lack wild-type p53."

Although a trial of Abeta vaccination in humans was halted because of autoimmune meningoencephalitis, favorable effects on Abeta deposition in the brain and on behavior were seen. Conflicting results have been observed concerning the relationship of circulating anti-Abeta antibodies and AD. Although these autoantibodies are thought to arise from exposure to Abeta, it is also possible that homologous proteins may induce antibody synthesis. We propose that the long-standing presence of anti-Abeta antibodies or antibodies to immunogens homologous to the Abeta protein may produce protective effects. The amino acid sequence of the potato virus Y (PVY) nuclear inclusion b protein is highly homologous to the immunogenic N-terminal region of Abeta. PVY infects potatoes and related crops worldwide. Here, we show through immunocytochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and NMR studies that mice inoculated with PVY develop antibodies that bind to Abeta in both neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, whereas antibodies to material from uninfected potato leaf show only modest levels of background immunoreactivity. NMR data show that the anti-PVY antibody binds to Abeta within the Phe4-Ser8 and His13-Leu17 regions. Immune responses generated from dietary exposure to proteins homologous to Abeta may induce antibodies that could influence the normal physiological processing of the protein and the development or progression of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2016754236,"The meso-diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC, EC 4.1.1.20) catalyzes the final step of L-lysine biosynthesis in bacteria and is regarded as a target for the discovery of antibiotics. Here we report the 2.3A crystal structure of DAPDC from Helicobacter pylori (HpDAPDC). The structure, in which the product L-lysine forms a Schiff base with the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, provides structural insight into the substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, and implies that the carboxyl to be cleaved locates at the si face of the cofactor. To our knowledge, this might be the first reported external aldimine of DAPDC. Moreover, the active site loop of HpDAPDC is in a ""down"" conformation and shields the ligand from solvent. Mutations of Ile(148) from the loop greatly impaired the catalytic efficiency. Combining the structural analysis of the I148L mutant, we hypothesize that HpDAPDC adopts an induced-fit catalytic mechanism in which this loop cycles through ""down"" and ""up"" conformations to stabilize intermediates and release product, respectively. Our work is expected to provide clues for designing specific inhibitors of DAPDC."

Several theories seeking to explain the disease association have been published over the years, most of them regarding the molecule and its peptide binding properties as a key to the pathogenic role of HLA-B27 (7Khan M.A. Mathieu A. Sorrentino R. Akkoc N. Autoimmun. Rev. 2007; 6: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This holds true for the hypotheses of molecular mimicry between foreign and self-peptides presented by HLA-B27 (14Fiorillo M. Rückert C. Hülsmeyer M. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A.

Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 73-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite these efforts, the molecular basis of the strong linkage of HLA-B27 with spondyloarthropathies still remains elusive. Apart from its association to spondyloarthropathies, B*2705 is also connected with the long term nonprogression in chronic HIV infection through the presentation of B*2705-restricted peptides such as gag-(263–272) (KRWIILGLNK) from HIV (22Goulder P. Phillips R. Colbert R. McAdam S. Ogg G. Nowak M. Giangrande P. Luzzi G. Morgana B. Edwards A. McMichael A. Rowland-Jones S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of B*2705 complexed with this peptide demonstrates again the pivotal role of the guanidinium group of arginine at position 2 of the peptide (pArg-2) as the main anchor for the peptide in the B-pocket of the peptide binding groove (23Stewart-Jones G. di Gleria K. Kollnberger S. McMichael A. Jones E. Bowness P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); peptides with an exchange of pArg-2, as observed during HIV infections, fail to be presented by HLA-B27 antigens resulting in immune escape. Although peptide stability and HLA-B27 selectivity are mainly a consequence of the presence of pArg-2 and its binding within the B-pocket (Fig. 1), every other peptide position may in principle contribute to stable peptide binding (24López de Castro J. Alvarez I. Marcilla M. Paradela A. Ramos M. Sesma L. Vázquez M. Tissue Antigens. 2004; 63: 424-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The C terminal (pΩ) peptide residue is regarded as a particularly important secondary anchor, which binds within the F-pocket. In B*2705 the acidic Asp-116 at the floor of the peptide binding groove, along with two other F-pocket residues, Asp-74 and Asp-77, plays a key role in the interaction of basic pΩ peptide residues (10Hülsmeyer M. Hillig R. Volz A. Rühl M. Schröder W. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2005; 35: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Peptide elution studies showed that the basic amino acids Lys and Arg are strong pΩ anchors for nonameric peptides binding to B*2705. Peptides with pΩArg or pΩLys account for 27% of the natural B*2705 ligands, whereas they are absent (pΩLys) or rare (pΩArg) in the peptide repertoire of B*2709 (24López de Castro J. Alvarez I.

López de Castro J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28749-28756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, Asp-116 has been reported to promote a noncanonical binding mode in two peptides that contain an arginine at position 5 (RRKWRRWHL from a self-protein, pVIPR; and RRRWRRLTV from a viral protein, pLMP2). In this noncanonical binding mode, pArg-5 forms a salt bridge to Asp-116 (11Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Fiorillo M. Rückert C. Hülsmeyer M. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Biol.

In the B*2709 subtype, the exchange of Asp-116 by His does not permit this strong electrostatic interaction. As the different peptide binding properties of the subtypes also shape the antigenic features for recognition by T cell receptors or other molecules such as inhibitory receptors on natural killer cells (in case of HLA-B27, e.g. KIR3DL1) (23Stewart-Jones G. di Gleria K. Kollnberger S. McMichael A. Jones E. Bowness P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we set out to compare several different peptides (Table 1) in terms of their complex stability and electrostatic interactions between the peptide and the B*2705 and B*2709 subtypes. The results reveal that differences in complex stability as well as in peptide binding affinity between the two very closely related HLA molecules can mainly be explained by changes in the interaction energy between the peptide anchors and the binding groove, although the individual contributions to the peptide binding free energy can differ considerably, even for peptides with high sequence similarity. Furthermore, we find that peptide binding affinities are influenced not only by the expected short range but also by long range interactions between peptide residues and HC amino acids that are crucial in shaping the binding groove.TABLE 1B*2705 or B*2709 bound peptides investigated in this study The citation after each abbreviation represents the reference where the crystal structure of the given HLA-B27/peptide complex is published.SequenceOrigin/peptideAbbreviationRRLPIFSRLHuman self-peptide: epidermal growth factor response factor, residues 479–487TIS (13Hülsmeyer M.

The synthetic peptides as well as their fluorescent derivatives labeled with Lucifer Yellow (LY, Molecular Probes) in position C-6 and C-8, respectively, were purchased from Alta Bioscience (Birmingham, UK), Biosynthan (Berlin, Germany), or synthesized in-house. Briefly, heterotrimeric HLA-B27/peptide complexes (HC/β2m/peptide) were reconstituted from 6 m urea in the presence of the respective peptide. After size exclusion chromatography, the concentrations of highly pure MHC/peptide complexes in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl were adjusted to A426 = 0.0012 OD using the absorption band of Lucifer Yellow (λmax ≈ 430 nm). Thermodynamics of Peptide Dissociation—Temperature-induced peptide dissociation from a given MHC/peptide complex was measured by detection of the change in the stationary anisotropy of LY covalently bound to the peptides in the temperature range from 5 to 85 °C (16Pöhlmann T. Böckmann R. Grubmüller H. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Alexiev U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28197-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An average heating rate of 0.6 °C/min was applied. Lucifer Yellow was excited at λex = 428 nm, and the steady state anisotropy was determined within a time-correlated single photon counting setup (27Alexiev U. Rimke I. Pöhlmann T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) by collecting the integral emission intensity for λ ≥ 515 nm parallel I∥ and perpendicular I⊥ with respect to the linearly polarized excitation light. The anisotropy values were calculated according to Equation 1,r(t)=I∥(t)-I⊥(t)I∥(t)+2I⊥(t)(Eq. 1) Thermodynamic parameters, such as the enthalpy and entropy changes of the unfolding process as well as transition temperatures (Tm) for peptide dissociation, were obtained by fitting Equation 2 to the steady state anisotropy applying a least square procedure,r(T)=r0b+sbT+(r0d+sdT)exp-ΔHp0+TΔSp0RT1+exp-ΔHp0+TΔSp0RT(Eq. 2) with Equation 3Tm=ΔHp0ΔSp0(Eq. 3) This equation involves six fitting parameters, respectively; the fluorescence anisotropy of the folded state (native protein), r0b, and of the unfolded or dissociated state, r0d, the temperature dependence of the anisotropy of the peptide-bound (folded) state, Sb, and of the unfolded or dissociated state, Sd, the enthalpy change, ΔH0p, and the entropy change, ΔS0p, for the two-state dissociation reaction, the thermodynamic quantities being determined at the midpoint of the transition. HLA-B27 complex unfolding was also followed by the change in the tryptophan fluorescence intensity (16Pöhlmann T. Böckmann R. Grubmüller H. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Alexiev U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28197-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Comparison of the complex unfolding transition temperatures for HLA complexes with the natural and the LY-labeled peptide (data not shown) indicated that the modification with Lucifer Yellow does not change the thermodynamic properties of the respective complex. For comparison of the relative complex stability between B*2705 and B*2709 molecules complexed with the same peptide, we calculated the difference in free energy ΔΔGB*2709-B*2705, given by Equation 4,ΔΔGB*2709-B*2705=ΔTB*2709-B*2705·ΔS¯B*27090(Eq. 4) ΔTB*2709-B*2705 is the difference of the peptide dissociation temperatures determined for the complexes B*2705 and B*2709 and ΔS0B*2709 is the apparent entropy of the peptide dissociation reaction from B*2709 determined by applying the two-state transition model (Equation 2). According to Becktel and Shellman (28Becktel W. Schellman J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1859-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), Equation 4 represents a method for the calculation of free energy differences of biomolecular systems showing only small perturbations, i.e. systems that differ only by small modifications, like a single point mutation or the selective binding of a ligand. Because the two HLA-B27 molecules investigated in this study are very closely related and differ only by one amino acid, the conditions for the use of Equation 4 are fulfilled. For the comparison of the relative stability between HLA-B27/pVIPR, HLA-B27/pLMP2, HLA-B27/pVIPR-H8T, and HLA-B27/pLMP2-T8H, respectively, we used the same method, now considering the difference between the sequence-related peptides pVIPR and pLMP2 or their mutants pLMP2-T8H and pVIPR-H8T as a small modification to the system. As the folded protein/peptide complex is characterized by a positive ΔG value, destabilization (stabilization) thus appears as a negative (positive) ΔΔG value (28Becktel W. Schellman J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1859-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). pKa Analysis—Protein residue pKa calculations were performed on the crystal structures of the two B*2705 and B*2709 subtypes complexed with several different peptides (pLMP2 (14Fiorillo M.

The peptides gag-(263–272) (gag) from HIV, EBNA3C-(258–266) (pEBNA-3C) from Epstein-Barr virus, and nucleoprotein 383–391 (flu) from influenza (23Stewart-Jones G. di Gleria K. Kollnberger S. McMichael A. Jones E. Bowness P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were also included in the study. The resolution of the used crystal structures of the complexes varies from 1.09 to 2.30 Å. The peptides are listed in Table 1. To understand how the presence or absence of a peptide and/or of β2m in the complex could influence the effective protonation state of the titratable groups, the pKa calculations were additionally performed on both HLA-B27 subtypes without peptide and with or without β2m. Peptide mutants were obtained as follows: pHis-8 of pVIPR was mutated with a threonine using the WHAT IF (29Vriend G. J. Mol. Graphics. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar) package (experimental version of the function mutate (30Chinea G. Padron G. Hooft R. Sander C. Vriend G. Proteins. 1995; 23: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)). For the exchange of pThr-8 in pLMP2 with a histidine, a different strategy was adopted; after fit of the peptide backbone atoms of residues 7 to 9, the side chain of pThr-8 in pLMP2 was replaced by the side chain of the pHis-8 in pVIPR B, followed by a short energy minimization of the structure using a steepest descent algorithm (100 steps). The pKa calculations were based on the scheme proposed by Nielsen et al. (31Nielsen J.E. Vriend G. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Despite membrane expression for all but three constructs (S112C, Y117C, S126C), most EL1 mutants (64%) were inactivated by cysteine mutation, suggesting a functional role during sodium/bile acid co-transport. A negative charge at conserved residues Asp-120 and Asp-122 is required for transport function, whereas neutralization of charge at Asp-124 yields a functionally active transporter. D124A exerts low affinity for common bile acids except deoxycholic acid, which uniquely lacks a 7α-hydroxyl (OH) group. Overall, we conclude that (i) Asp-122 functions as a Na+ sensor, binding one of two co-transported Na+ ions, (ii) Asp-124 interacts with 7α-OH groups of bile acids, and (iii) apolar EL1 residues map to hydrophobic ligand pharmacophore features.

Moreover, ASBT constitutes an attractive target for prodrug strategies aimed at increasing oral bioavailability of poorly absorbed drugs (15Balakrishnan A. Polli J.E. Mol.

In an effort to elucidate critical components of the transport cycle, particularly protein segments or amino acids involved in substrate recognition, binding, and permeation, our present study applies the validated cysteine-scanning accessibility mutagenesis technique (18Guan L.

Using this approach, we have thus far identified putative portions of the substrate permeation path, including specific protein regions likely interacting or binding substrates of ASBT (21Banerjee A. Hussainzada N. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Banerjee A. Ray A. Chang C. Swaan P.W.

Here, we focused on the highly conserved, large extracellular loop 1 (EL1) spanning 27 amino acids (Val-99—Ser-126) based on the following rationale. (i) The functional importance of charged protein residues during Na+ and bile acid binding events, as demonstrated by our group (21Banerjee A. Hussainzada N. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Zhang E.Y. Phelps M.A. Banerjee A. Khantwal C.M. Chang C. Helsper F. Swaan P.W.

Chem. 2006; 281: 16410-16418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggests functional involvement of Asp-120, Asp-122, and Asp-124, which are clustered along the distal half of EL1 during Na+ binding events. Moreover, numerous polar residues, also capable of long range electrostatic interactions with charged substrates, are present throughout the EL1 segment. Prior studies using ASBT orthologs (26Sun A.Q. Balasubramaniyan N. Chen H. Shahid M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16410-16418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and paralogs (27Zahner D. Eckhardt U. Petzinger E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) concluded that the EL1-localized Asp-122 (Asp-115 in NTCP) may form a sodium sensor, binding one of the two co-transported Na+ ions during the ASBT transport cycle. (ii) Both EL1 and EL3 protein segments have been speculated to act as re-entrant loop segments by Zahner et al. (27Zahner D. Eckhardt U. Petzinger E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), who postulated the formation of a P-loop structure by EL1/3 to explain transport mechanisms of the rat Ntcp and recently purported for ASBT (16Geyer J. Wilke T. Petzinger E. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2006; 372: 413-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although such a mechanism remains experimentally unverified, it nonetheless spotlights the need for a systematic analysis of this loop segment to increasing our overall understanding of ASBT transport mechanisms and, indeed, solute transporters in general. Toward this aim we have incorporated individual cysteine substitutions along EL1 against our previously established parental scaffold, C270A, followed by thiol modification and structural and functional assessments of each mutant transporter. Our results demonstrate putative sodium and bile acid interactions along EL1; furthermore, long-range electrostatic and dipole-dipole interactions between essential EL1 and EL3 residues may contribute to proper tertiary structure of substrate binding cavities and couple cooperative binding events. We conclude a functional contribution of a string of conserved aspartic acids lining EL1, with Asp-120 and/or Asp-122 functioning as a putative sodium sensor and Asp-124 mediating protein contacts with the cholestane skeleton of bile acids. Additionally, a mechanism coupling binding of two sodium ions at their respective binding sites, Asp-122 and the previously identified Glu-261, (21Banerjee A. Hussainzada N. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) is posited based on integration of our results. Materials—[3H]Taurocholic acid (0.2 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.

(North York, ON, Canada). Cell culture media and supplies were obtained from Invitrogen. All other reagents and chemicals were of highest purity available commercially. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—COS-1 cells (ATCC CRL-1650) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Transient transfections were performed as previously described (22Banerjee A. Ray A. Chang C. Swaan P.W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8908-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutations were incorporated into hASBT cDNA using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and mutagenesis primers were custom-synthesized and purchased from Sigma Genosys. Plasmid purifications were performed using a kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), and amino acid substitutions were confirmed via DNA sequencing using an ABI 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the Plant-Microbe Genomics Facility of The Ohio State University. Bile Acid Uptake Assay—Initial rates of transport for each mutant were determined in transiently transfected COS-1 cells incubated in modified Hanks' balanced salt solution (MHBSS), pH 7.4, uptake buffer containing 5.0 μm [3H]TCA at 37 °C for 12 min. This uptake period ensures linear steady-state kinetics in conjunction with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio for subsequent [3H]TCA analysis via liquid scintillation counting (22Banerjee A. Ray A.

Uptake was halted by a series of washes with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin and 0.5 mm TCA. Cells were lysed in 350 μl of a 1 n NaOH, and aliquots were analyzed using an LS6500 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) and total protein quantification using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Uptake activity was calculated as pmol of [3H]TCA internalized/min/mg of protein. For inhibition studies, uptake of 5 μm [3H]TCA was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of each bile acid analog (10–8–10–2 m). Uptake rates were plotted against inhibitor concentration. Kinetic data were analyzed using nonlinear least-squares fitting by SigmaPlot software (Jandel Scientific). For bile acid uptake kinetics, constants were derived by fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation, V = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S]), where [S] is bile acid concentration, Vmax is uptake rate at saturating [S], and Km is the substrate concentration at 0.5 Vmax. IC50 values were calculated using competitive inhibition kinetics, E = Emax(1 – [S]/([S] + IC50), where Emax is uptake of [3H]TCA in the absence of inhibitor, and [S] is inhibitor concentration. Protein Membrane Expression—Protein expression was determined as described previously (23Hussainzada N. Banerjee A. Swaan P.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, transiently transfected COS-1 cells were lysed, separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto an immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Blots were probed with rabbit anti-ASBT primary antibody (1:1000) and visualized using goat anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:30,000) with chemiluminescent detection (ECL Plus Western blot kit, Amersham Biosciences). Levels of cell surface protein expression were measured via biotin labeling of transiently transfected COS-1 cells with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin for 30 min at room temperature (29Mitchell S.M. Lee E. Garcia M.L. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24089-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27228-27234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). After several washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2, MgCl2, and 100 mm glycine, cells were disrupted with 0.4 ml of lysis buffer B at 4 °C for 20 min (25Zhang E.Y. Phelps M.A. Banerjee A. Khantwal C.M. Chang C. Helsper F. Swaan P.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11380-11392Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and biotinylated proteins were recovered overnight at 4 °C using 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads. Samples were eluted with SDS-PAGE buffer, and immunoblotting was performed as described above. Blots were probed for positive and negative controls, the plasma membrane marker α-integrin (150 kDa), and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein calnexin (90 kDa) to assess the integrity of the biotinylation procedure (calnexin data not shown). Relative ASBT membrane expression was standardized to integrin expression and quantified via densitometry as previously described (23Hussainzada N. Banerjee A. Swaan P.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Sodium Activation and Kinetics—Measurement of [3H]TCA uptake at equilibrating extracellular Na+ concentrations (12 mm, i.e. at equilibrium with cytosolic [Na+]) was performed (uptake conducted as described above; choline chloride used as equimolar NaCl replacement) and expressed as a ratio of uptake at physiological (137 mm) Na+ concentrations to determine overall sensitivity of each mutant to the presence/absence of Na+. Theoretically, Na+ ratios equal to one imply little measurable difference in transporter activity despite the scarcity of Na+ ions, whereas fractions less than one indicate a greater necessity for physiological Na+ concentrations for proper transport function of a mutant transporter. For sodium activation kinetics, uptake of 5 μm [3H]TCA was measured at sodium concentrations ranging from 0 to 137 mm with isomolarity maintained with choline chloride. Kinetic constants were derived by fitting data to the Hill equation, V = Vmax[Na+]n/(KNan[Na+]n), where [Na+] is sodium concentration, Vmax is uptake rate at saturating [Na+], i.e. 137 mm, KNa is the sodium concentration at 0.5 Vmax, and n is the Hill coefficient. MTS Inhibition Studies—Sensitivity of mutants to the positively charged, membrane-impermeant MTSET (1 mm) was determined by preincubation of transiently transfected COS-1 cells for 10 min at room temperature followed by 2 washes with MHBSS, pH 7.4, and [3H]TCA uptake as described above. Because of its short aqueous half-life, MTSET solutions were freshly prepared before each study. Cation Protection Assays—To determine whether the presence or absence of Na+ alters MTSET labeling, transiently transfected COS-1 cells were washed twice in either 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, or Na+-free buffer (MHBSS except choline chloride entirely substitutes NaCl) followed by incubation with MTSET (1 mm) prepared in either MHBSS or Na+-free buffer for 10 min at room temperature. After preincubation treatments, cells were washed twice in either MHBSS, pH 7.4, or Na+-free buffer and additionally equilibrated for 15 min at 37 °C in these buffers followed by determination of [3H]TCA uptake as described above. All control wells were treated identically. For each mutant transporter, uptake values were determined by taking a ratio of mutant uptake at each experimental condition versus mutant uptake for its respective unmodified control. We normalize mutant ratios to C270A by expressing mutant ratios for each condition as a percentage of C270A ratios calculated in the same manner. MTSEA-biotin Labeling of Cysteine Mutants—COS-1 cells transiently expressing each mutant were washed twice with either MHBSS, pH 7.4, or Na+-free buffer (+/–sodium buffer) followed by incubation with 0.5 ml MTSEA-biotin (2 mm) prepared in +/–sodium buffer for 30 min at room temperature with rocking. For studies evaluating the effect of substrate on biotin labeling, cells were coincubated with both GDCA (1 mm) and MTSEA-biotin prepared in +/–sodium buffer as described above. For MTSET competition studies, cells were first preincubated with MTSET (1 mm) prepared in +/–sodium buffer for 10 min at room temperature, then washed twice with +/–sodium buffer followed by MTSEA-biotin labeling as described above. For each experiment, a 200 mm stock solution of MTSEA-biotin was prepared in DMSO and kept cold and dark until appropriately diluted with +/–sodium buffer just before use. After labeling, cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2, MgCl2, and 100 mm glycine and lysed with lysis buffer B (see “Protein Membrane Expression” methods for composition). Samples were eluted with streptavidin (100 μl) overnight at 4 °C with immunoblotting performed as described above. All MTSEA-biotinylation studies were repeated on two separate occasions (n = 2). Data Analysis—For each mutant data are represented as the mean ± S.D. of at least three different experiments with triplicate measurements. Data analysis was performed with Graph-Pad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) using either analysis of variance with Dunnett's post hoc test or Student's t test as appropriate. Data were considered statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05. Cysteine Scan of EL1—As predicted by our topology model (25Zhang E.Y. Phelps M.A. Banerjee A. Khantwal C.M. Chang C. Helsper F. Swaan P.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11380-11392Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Banerjee A. Swaan P.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), residues spanning Val-99—Ser-126 form the EL1 protein region, which exhibits high sequence conservation among a range of evolutionarily diverse species (Fig. 1). In the present study cysteines were consecutively introduced along EL1 (V99C–S126C) followed by structure-function assessments. Mutant P105C could not be constructed. Transport Activity and Membrane Expression of Cysteine Mutants—Because of minimal background levels of bile acid transport (23Hussainzada N. Banerjee A. Swaan P.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), COS-1 cells were used for transient expression and [3H]TCA uptake analysis of EL1 mutant transporters. Protein surface expression was measured via biotin labeling with the membrane-impermeant sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and immunoblotting followed by densitometry of developed protein bands (Fig. 2B). ASBT bands for each sample were standardized to an internal control (α-integrin) and expressed as a percentage of C270A intensity. Then, initial uptake activity was normalized to relative membrane expression for each mutant (Fig. 2A). Uptake activity for most mutants (64%) lining EL1 was significantly (p < 0.05) hampered (Fig. 2A), including two of the negatively charged aspartic acid residues thought to be important during transport (D120C, D122C). Lack of membrane expression accounted for loss-of-function only for mutants S112C, Y117C, and S126C (Fig. 2). Expression in whole cell extract was also absent for S112C and S126C (data not shown), suggesting defective protein synthesis or altered protein stability and folding leading to endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. In contrast, mutant Y117C exhibited detectable expression in whole cell extract, suggesting membrane trafficking or insertion defects. Remaining EL1 mutant transporters demonstrated measurable surface expression, with the notable exception of L115C (Fig. 2B). Despite uptake activity similar to control (Fig. 2A), mutant L115C displayed little measurable membrane expression in three separate assessments, although its expression in whole cell extract appears abundant (results not shown). Although surprising, it is possible that cysteine substitution at this position produced a “hyperactive” mutant transporter, which despite exceedingly low membrane expression, transports substrate at control levels. This may be due to substantially altered substrate turnover rates leading to uptake activity corresponding to control but at appreciably lower surface densities of transporter expression. All mutants with measurable uptake activity were further analyzed. Na+ Sensitivity of Cysteine Mutants—By coupling the active translocation of one bile acid molecule to the flow of two Na+ ions down their electrochemical gradient, ASBT concentrates bile acids within the cell interior (31Weinman S.A. Carruth M.W. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34691-34695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because previous studies implicate the EL1 region during Na+ recognition (16Geyer J. Wilke T. Petzinger E. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2006; 372: 413-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25Zhang E.Y. Phelps M.A. Banerjee A. Khantwal C.M. Chang C. Helsper F. Swaan P.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11380-11392Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Sun A.Q. Balasubramaniyan N. Chen H. Shahid M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16410-16418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we examined consequences of equilibrating (12 mm; i.e. [Na+]out = [Na+]in) sodium concentrations upon activity of all constructed cysteine mutants. For each mutant, the ratio of transport rates at equilibrating versus physiological (137 mm) Na+ concentrations was calculated and expressed as a percentage of the C270A Na+ ratio (Fig. 3). Potentially, defects in ability to bind Na+ or in coupling of Na+ to transport may be uncovered using this experimental protocol. The C270A parental construct displays a Na+ ratio of 0.70 ± 0.04 (data not shown), suggesting minimal alterations in Na+ dependence of the transporter upon alanine substitution of Cys-270. Uptake activity of V99C, M123C, and D124C was not affected at equilibrating [Na+] compared with control (Fig. 3), indicating minimal Na+ sensitivity for these sites. In contrast, mutants I103C, G104C, T110C, L115C, A116C, and V119C exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) loss of activity at lowered sodium concentrations (12 mm) (Fig. 3). Whether these residues play direct or indirect roles during sodium interactions is unclear at present. Because cysteine introduction poses a non-conservative amino acid change at these sites but yields minimal loss of activity at physiological [Na+] (Fig. 2), direct Na+ interactions are unlikely. Rather, indirect effects on Na+ dependence of the transporter may account for the results observed; for example, these residues may form interactions with other residues important for maintaining correct three-dimensional conformation of sodium binding sites. Alternatively, they may be involved in coupling sodium binding to later steps in the transport cycle. MTSET Sensitivity of EL1 Mutants—Intact COS-1 monolayers expressing mutant transporters were preincubated with 1 mm MTSET prepared in buffer containing either NaCl (“sodium buffer”) or choline chloride (“sodium-free buffer”) followed by several washes in appropriate buffer before evaluation of remaining [3H]TCA uptake activity. Presumably, only mutants with sulfhydryl groups facing an aqueous milieu (rather than lipid or internal protein environments) will form the more reactive (thiolate) species targeted by MTS reagents for modification (32Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite its exofacial orientation, only one EL1 mutant (T110C; Fig. 4) was significantly affected upon MTSET (1 mm) application. Reversal of this inhibitory effect could be achieved for T110C by removing Na+ from the preincubation buffer, suggesting alternating accessibility of this residue mediated by Na+ binding (Fig. 4). Alternatively, thiol modification at T110C may be functionally silent when MTSET is applied in the absence of Na+. Functionally silent modification may also account for the lack of MTSET inhibition for the remainder of EL1 sites examined (Fig. 4). MTSEA-biotin Labeling of EL1 Mutants—Our substituted cysteine accessibility method studies in this manuscript thus far merely examined the functional effects of chemical modification with MTSET. However, residues that show no functional consequence of MTSET treatment may still be accessible to thiol modification by this reagent. Therefore, we evaluated whether EL1 cysteine mutants could be labeled with a biotin derivative, specifically MTSEA-biotin (Fig. 5A). In one set of studies labeling was done after preincubation with or without MTSET to determine whether MTSET and MTSEA-biotin bind the same sites. In another set of studies, labeling was done in the presence and absence of a natural high affinity ASBT substrate, GDCA (Km = 2.0 ± 0.4 μm) to determine whether bile acid substrates could protect against labeling. Finally, in all of these studies, reagents were prepared in both Na+-free and Na+-containing buffer to determine the effects of the co-transported sodium ion on cysteine labeling. To confirm the"
https://openalex.org/W2044652150,"Translocations of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha) locus with the promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF) or PML genes lead to expression of oncogenic PLZF-RARalpha or PML-RARalpha fusion proteins, respectively. These fusion oncoproteins constitutively repress RARalpha target genes, in large part through aberrant recruitment of multiprotein co-repressor complexes. PML and PML-RARalpha have previously been shown to associate with the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor protein in its hypophosphorylated state. Here, we demonstrate that PLZF also interacts with Rb in vitro and in vivo. The interaction between PLZF and Rb is mediated through the Rb pocket and the region of PLZF that lies between its transcriptional repression (poxvirus and zinc-finger, POZ) and DNA-binding (zinc-finger) domains. In addition, Rb can simultaneously interact with PLZF and the E2F1 S phase-inducing transcription factor, suggesting that these proteins can exist in the same multiprotein complex. In contrast to the interaction of Rb with PML or E2F1, the PLZF-Rb interaction is not dependent on hypophosphorylation of Rb. These data are supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, which indicates that PLZF associates with the promoter region of CDC6, a known E2F/Rb target gene. Co-expression of PLZF and Rb results in enhancement of transcriptional repression of PLZF and E2F/Rb target genes, indicating functional co-operation between the two proteins. Both PLZF and Rb have been shown to function in stem cells and taken together these data suggest that interactions between PLZF and Rb could be important in stem cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W2071377702,"The discovery of beta-arrestin-related approximately 46-kDa polypeptide in transfected cells and mouse hearts led us to examine angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R)-dependent proteolytic cleavage of beta-arrestin(s). Receptor-ligand induced proteolysis of beta-arrestin(s) is novel, especially in the endocrine system, since proteolytic and/or splice variants of nonvisual arrestins are unknown. We used a strategy to retrieve AT(1)R-engaged isoforms of beta-arrestin 1 to confirm direct interaction of fragments with this G protein-coupled receptor and determine cleavage sites. Here we show that the angiotensin II-AT(1)R complex is associated with full-length and approximately 46-kDa beta-arrestin forms. Mass spectrometric analysis of the AT(1)R-associated short form suggested a scissile site located within the Arg(363)-Arg(393) region in the bovine beta-arrestin 1. Edman degradation analysis of a beta-arrestin 1 C-terminal fragment fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein confirmed the major cleavage to be after Phe(388) and a minor cleavage after Asn(375). Rather unexpectedly, the inverse agonist EXP3174-bound AT(1)R generated different fragmentation of bovine beta-arrestin 1, at Pro(276). The angiotensin II-induced cleavage is independent of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate- and Ca(2+)-mediated signaling pathways. The proteolysis of beta-arrestin 2 occurs, but the pattern is more complex. Our findings suggest that beta-arrestin cleavage upon AT(1)R stimulation is a part of the unraveling beta-arrestin-mediated G protein-coupled receptor signaling diversity."
