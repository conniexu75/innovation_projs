https://openalex.org/W2925056832,"Invasive alien species are a major threat to native insular species. Eradicating invasive mammals from islands is a feasible and proven approach to prevent biodiversity loss. We developed a conceptual framework to identify globally important islands for invasive mammal eradications to prevent imminent extinctions of highly threatened species using biogeographic and technical factors, plus a novel approach to consider socio-political feasibility. We applied this framework using a comprehensive dataset describing the distribution of 1,184 highly threatened native vertebrate species (i.e. those listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List) and 184 non-native mammals on 1,279 islands worldwide. Based on extinction risk, irreplaceability, severity of impact from invasive species, and technical feasibility of eradication, we identified and ranked 292 of the most important islands where eradicating invasive mammals would benefit highly threatened vertebrates. When socio-political feasibility was considered, we identified 169 of these islands where eradication planning or operation could be initiated by 2020 or 2030 and would improve the survival prospects of 9.4% of the Earth’s most highly threatened terrestrial insular vertebrates (111 of 1,184 species). Of these, 107 islands were in 34 countries and territories and could have eradication projects initiated by 2020. Concentrating efforts to eradicate invasive mammals on these 107 islands would benefit 151 populations of 80 highly threatened vertebrates and make a major contribution towards achieving global conservation targets adopted by the world’s nations."
https://openalex.org/W2925321084,"As climate change continues to exert increasing pressure upon the livelihoods and agricultural sector of many developing and developed nations, a need exists to understand and prioritise at the sub national scale which areas and communities are most vulnerable. The purpose of this study is to develop a robust, rigorous and replicable methodology that is flexible to data limitations and spatially prioritizes the vulnerability of agriculture and rural livelihoods to climate change. We have applied the methodology in Vietnam, Uganda and Nicaragua, three contrasting developing countries that are particularly threatened by climate change. We conceptualize vulnerability to climate change following the widely adopted combination of sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity. We used Ecocrop and Maxent ecological models under a high emission climate scenario to assess the sensitivity of the main food security and cash crops to climate change. Using a participatory approach, we identified exposure to natural hazards and the main indicators of adaptive capacity, which were modelled and analysed using geographic information systems. We finally combined the components of vulnerability using equal-weighting to produce a crop specific vulnerability index and a final accumulative score. We have mapped the hotspots of climate change vulnerability and identified the underlying driving indicators. For example, in Vietnam we found the Mekong delta to be one of the vulnerable regions due to a decline in the climatic suitability of rice and maize, combined with high exposure to flooding, sea level rise and drought. However, the region is marked by a relatively high adaptive capacity due to developed infrastructure and comparatively high levels of education. The approach and information derived from the study informs public climate change policies and actions, as vulnerability assessments are the bases of any National Adaptation Plans (NAP), National Determined Contributions (NDC) and for accessing climate finance."
https://openalex.org/W2923474977,"It is vital to understand the adsorption mechanisms and identify the adsorption kinetics when applying an adsorbent to remove heavy metals from aqueous solution. A Pb(II) imprinted magnetic biosorbent (Pb(II)-IMB) was developed for the removal of Pb2+ via lead ion imprinting technology and crosslinking reactions among chitosan (CTS), Serratia marcescens and Fe3O4. The effect of different parameters such as solution pH, adsorbent dosage, selectivity sorption and desorption were investigated on the absorption of lead ion by Pb(II)-IMB. The adsorbent was characterized by a Brunauer-Emmett Teller (BET) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The adsorption kinetics, equilibrium and thermodynamics of Pb(II)-IMB for Pb(II) were studied. The results of the abovementioned analyses showed that the adsorption kinetic process fit well with the second-order equation. The adsorption isotherm process of Pb(II) on the Pb(II)-IMB was closely related to the Langmuir model. Thermodynamic studies suggested the spontaneous and endothermic nature of adsorption of Pb(II) by Pb(II)-IMB. The adsorption mechanism of Pb(II)-IMB was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicated that the nitrogen in the amino group and the oxygen in the hydroxyl group of Pb(II)-IMB were coordination atoms."
https://openalex.org/W2924686005,"The normal function of the mammalian reproductive axis is strongly influenced by physiological, metabolic and environmental factors. Kisspeptin neuropeptides, encoded by the Kiss1 gene, are potent regulators of the mammalian reproductive axis by stimulating gonadodropin releasing hormone secretion from the hypothalamus. To understand how the reproductive axis is modulated by higher order neuronal inputs we have mapped the afferent circuits into arcuate (ARC) Kiss1 neurons. We used a transgenic mouse that expresses the CRE recombinase in Kiss1 neurons for conditional viral tracing with genetically modified viruses. CRE-mediated activation of these viruses in Kiss1 neurons allows the virus to move transynaptically to label neurons with primary or secondary afferent inputs into the Kiss1 neurons. Several regions of the brain showed synaptic connectivity to arcuate Kiss1 neurons including proopiomelanocortin neurons in the ARC itself, kisspeptin neurons in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus, vasopressin neurons in the supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei, thyrotropin releasing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and unidentified neurons in other regions including the subfornical organ, amygdala, interpeduncular nucleus, ventral premammilary nucleus, basal nucleus of stria terminalis and the visual, somatosensory and piriform regions of the cortex. These data provide an insight into how the activity of Kiss1 neurons may be regulated by metabolic signals and provide a detailed neuroanatomical map for future functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W2923217679,"In chronic kidney disease both renal insufficiency and chronic inflammation trigger elevated hepcidin levels, which impairs iron uptake, availability. and erythropoiesis. Here we report the two first-in-human phase 1 trials of PRS-080#22, a novel, rationally engineered Anticalin protein that targets and antagonizes hepcidin. A single intravenous infusion of placebo or PRS-080#22 was administered to 48 healthy volunteers (phase 1a) and 24 patients with end stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (phase 1b) at different doses (0.08-16mg/kg for the phase 1a study and 2-8mg/kg for the phase 1b study) in successive dosing cohorts. The primary endpoint for both randomized, double-blind, phase 1 trials was safety and tolerability. Following treatment, all subjects were evaluable, with none experiencing dose limiting toxicities. Most adverse events were mild. One serious adverse event occurred in the phase 1b (CKD patient) study. There were no clinically significant changes in safety laboratory values or vital signs. PRS-080#22 showed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics (PK), with a terminal half-life of approximately three days in healthy volunteers and 10 to 12 days in CKD patients. Serum hepcidin levels were suppressed in a dose dependent manner and remained low for up to 48 hours after dosing. PRS-080#22 dose-dependently mobilized serum iron with increases in both serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation. No consistent changes were observed with regard to ferritin, reticulocytes, hemoglobin, and reticulocyte hemoglobin. Low titer anti-drug-antibodies were detected in five healthy volunteers but in none of the CKD patients. PRS-080#22, a novel Anticalin protein with picomolar affinity for hepcidin, was safe and well-tolerated when administered to healthy volunteers and CKD patients at all doses tested. The drug exhibited linear pharmacokinetics, longer half-life in CKD patients in comparison to healthy volunteers as well as expected pharmacodynamic effects which hold promise for further clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2925113193,"Faced with the scarcity of water resource and irrational fertilizer use, it is highly important to supply plants with water and fertilizer at desiderated stages to improve yield with high water use efficiency (WUE). A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of growth stage-specific water deficiency and potassium (K) fertilization on tomato yield and WUE. The entire growing season of tomato was divided into 5 stages: vegetative growth stage (VG), flowering and fruit setting stage (FS), early fruit growth stage (FG), fruit development stage (FD) and fruit maturity stage (FM). Three soil moisture (W) and three K fertilization levels were set up. W levels included W1, W2 and W3, indicating that soil water was maintained at 60–70% field capacity, 70–80% field capacity, and 80–90% field capacity, respectively. K levels included K1, K2 and K3, indicating that 0 g K2O per kg soil, 0.46 g K2O per kg soil and 0.92 g K2O per kg soil was applied. All combinations of the three W and three K levels were solely imposed at each of the five growth stages, for other four stages, plants were watered to 80–90% field capacity without K fertilizer (W3K1). The permanent W3K1 over the entire growth stage was taken as control (CK). The results showed that W deficiency imposed at all stages significantly affected tomato yield (P<0.01), except for VG stage in which W deficiency did not cause yield loss. K fertilization level during FS or FM stage had a significant effect on yield (P<0.01). A significant interaction effect of W and K on yield was only observed during FM stage. For WUE, significant effect of W deficiency at FS, FD and FM stages were observed, and a significant effect of K levels at FS, FD and FM stages was observed. Specifically, K fertilization was necessary during specific growth stage of tomato (i.e. FS and FM). During FS stage, even if a sufficient water supply seems necessary, a deficit irrigation with K fertilization could be applied as K fertilization could alleviate the negative effect of soil water deficit, however, excess of K fertilization during FM stage should be avoided to maintain tomato yield and WUE."
https://openalex.org/W2949356705,"In the 1970s, the introduced silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (which is indigenous to eastern Asia) escaped from southern U.S. aquaculture to spread throughout the Mississippi River basin, and since has steadily moved northward. This large, prolific filter-feeder reduces food availability for other fishes. It now has reached the threshold of the Laurentian Great Lakes, where it likely will significantly impact food chains and fisheries. Our study evaluates population genetic variability and differentiation of the silver carp using 10 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci, and sequences of two mitochondrial genes-cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, along with the nuclear ribosomal protein S7 gene intron 1. We analyze population samples from: two primary Great Lakes' invasion fronts (at the Illinois River outside of Chicago, IL in Lake Michigan and in the Wabash River, which leads into the Maumee River and western Lake Erie), the original establishment ""core"" in the Lower Mississippi River, and expansion areas in the Upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers. We analyze and compare our results with bighead and other invasive carps, and cyprinid relatives. Results reveal that the silver carp invasion possesses moderate levels of genetic diversity, with more mtDNA haplotypes and unique microsatellite alleles in the ""core"" Lower Mississippi River population, which also diverges the most. The two invasion fronts also significantly genetically differ. About 3% of individuals (including all populations except the Illinois River) contain a unique and very divergent mtDNA haplotype, which likely stems from historic introgression in Asia with female largescale silver carp H. harmandi. The nuclear microsatellites and S7 sequences of the introgressed individuals do not differ from silver carp and are very distant from bighead carp. These sequence variation data are employed to design and evaluate a targeted high-throughput metabarcoding sequence assay that identifies and distinguishes among species of invasive carps (i.e., silver, bighead, grass, black, and common carps, along with goldfish), as well as native cyprinids, using cytochrome b. Our assay further differentiates among selected silver carp haplotypes (including between H. molitrix and H. harmandi), for use in population genetics and future analyses of spread pathways. We test and evaluate this assay on environmental (e)DNA water samples from 48 bait shops in the Great Lakes' region (along the Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, and Wabash River watersheds), using positive and negative controls and custom bioinformatic processing. Test results discern silver carp eDNA in four of the shops-three in Lake Erie and one in the Wabash River watershed-and bighead carp from one of the same Lake Erie venues, suggesting that retailers (who often source from established southerly populations) comprise another introduction vector. Our overall findings thus provide key population genetic and phylogenetic data for understanding and tracing introductions, vectors, and spread pathways for silver carp, their variants, and their relatives."
https://openalex.org/W2923797470,"Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), a mevalonate pathway enzyme, is highly expressed in several cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). To date, the mechanistic, functional, and clinical significance of FDPS in cancer remains unexplored. We evaluated the FDPS expression and its cancer-associated phenotypes using in vitro and in vivo methods in PTEN-deficient and sufficient human and mouse PCa cells and tumors. Interestingly, FDPS overexpression synergizes with PTEN deficiency in PTEN conditionally knockout mice (P < 0.05) and expressed significantly higher in human (P < 0.001) PCa tissues, cell lines, and murine tumoroids compared to respective controls. In silico analysis revealed that FDPS is associated with increasing Gleason score, PTEN functionally deficient status, and poor survival of PCa. Ectopic overexpression of FDPS promotes oncogenic phenotypes such as colony formation (P < 0.01) and proliferation (P < 0.01) through activation of AKT and ERK signaling by prenylating Rho A, Rho G, and CDC42 small GTPases. Of interest, knockdown of FDPS in PCa cells exhibits decreased colony growth and proliferation (P < 0.001) by modulating AKT and ERK pathways. Further, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PI3K but not AKT reduced FDPS expression. Pharmacological targeting of FDPS by zoledronic acid (ZOL), which is already in clinics, exhibit reduced growth and clonogenicity of human and murine PCa cells (P < 0.01) and 3D tumoroids (P < 0.02) by disrupting AKT and ERK signaling through direct interference of small GTPases protein prenylation. Thus, FDPS plays an oncogenic role in PTEN-deficient PCa through GTPase/AKT axis. Identifying mevalonate pathway proteins could serve as a therapeutic target in PTEN dysregulated tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2923407054,"4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU) inhibits hyaluronan (HA) synthesis and is an approved drug used for managing biliary spasm. However, rapid and efficient glucuronidation is thought to limit its utility for systemically inhibiting HA synthesis. In particular, 4-MU in mice has a short half-life, causing most of the drug to be present as the metabolite 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (4-MUG), which makes it remarkable that 4-MU is effective at all. We report here that 4-MUG contributes to HA synthesis inhibition. We observed that oral administration of 4-MUG to mice inhibits HA synthesis, promotes FoxP3+ regulatory T-cell expansion, and prevents autoimmune diabetes. Mice fed either 4-MUG or 4-MU had equivalent 4-MU:4-MUG ratios in serum, liver, and pancreas, indicating that 4-MU and 4-MUG reach an equilibrium in these tissues. LC–tandem MS experiments revealed that 4-MUG is hydrolyzed to 4-MU in serum, thereby greatly increasing the effective bioavailability of 4-MU. Moreover, using intravital 2-photon microscopy, we found that 4-MUG (a nonfluorescent molecule) undergoes conversion into 4-MU (a fluorescent molecule) and that 4-MU is extensively tissue bound in the liver, fat, muscle, and pancreas of treated mice. 4-MUG also suppressed HA synthesis independently of its conversion into 4-MU and without depletion of the HA precursor UDP-glucuronic acid (GlcUA). Together, these results indicate that 4-MUG both directly and indirectly inhibits HA synthesis and that the effective bioavailability of 4-MU is higher than previously thought. These findings greatly alter the experimental and therapeutic possibilities for HA synthesis inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2952050509,"Human skeletal muscle fibers exist across a continuum of slow → fast-twitch. The amount of each fiber type (FT) influences muscle performance but remains largely unexplored in elite athletes, particularly from strength/power sports. To address this nescience, vastus lateralis (VL) biopsies were performed on World/Olympic (female, n = 6, ""WCF"") and National-caliber (female, n = 9, ""NCF""; and male, n = 6, ""NCM"") American weightlifters. Participant accolades included 3 Olympic Games, 19 World Championships, 25 National records, and >170 National/International medals. Samples were analyzed for myosin heavy chain (MHC) content via SDS-PAGE using two distinct techniques: single fiber (SF) distribution (%) and homogenate (HG) composition. The main finding was that these athletes displayed the highest pure MHC IIa concentrations ever reported in healthy VL (23±9% I, 5±3% I/IIa, 67±13% IIa, and 6±10% IIa/IIx), with WCF expressing a notable 71±17% (NCF = 67±8%, NCM = 63±16%). No pure MHC IIx were found with SF. Secondary analysis revealed the heavyweights accounted for 91% of the MHC IIa/IIx fibers, which caused a correlation between this FT and body mass. Additionally, when compared to SF, HG overestimated MHC I (23±9 vs. 31±9%) and IIx (0±0 vs. 3±6%) by misclassifying I/IIa fibers as I and IIa/IIx fibers as IIx, highlighting the limitation of HG as a measure of isoform distribution. These results collectively suggest that athlete caliber (World vs. National) and/or years competing in the sport determine FT% more than sex, particularly for MHC IIa. The extreme fast-twitch myofiber abundance likely explains how elite weightlifters generate high forces in rapid time-frames."

Under conditions of ER stress, GRP78 is also expressed at the cell surface and implicated in tumorigenesis, immunity, and cellular signaling events. The role of cell surface–associated GRP78 (csGRP78) in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy has not yet been defined. Here we explored the role of csGRP78 in regulating high glucose (HG)–induced profibrotic AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT) signaling and up-regulation of extracellular matrix proteins. Using primary kidney mesangial cells, we show that HG treatment, but not the osmotic control mannitol, induces csGRP78 expression through an ER stress–dependent mechanism. We found that csGRP78, known to be located on the outer membrane leaflet, interacts with the transmembrane protein integrin β1 and activates focal adhesion kinase and downstream PI3K/AKT signaling. Localization of GRP78 at the cell surface and its interaction with integrin β1 were also required for extracellular matrix protein synthesis in response to HG. Surprisingly, both the N and C termini of csGRP78 were necessary for this profibrotic response. Increased localization of GRP78 at the plasma membrane was also found in the glomerular mesangial area of type 1 diabetic mice in two different models (streptozotocin-induced and Akita). In freshly isolated glomeruli from Akita mice, csGRP78 co-localized with the mesangial cell surface marker α8-integrin.

At the cell surface, GRP78 acts as a signaling receptor for agonists such as α2-macroglobulin and anti-GRP78 autoantibodies. Activation of csGRP78 promotes its association with other cell surface proteins, leading to intracellular signaling events, the nature of which depends on the cell type and interacting partners (9Ni M.

However, whether cell surface expression of GRP78 is increased and contributes to DN is unknown. Our results show that, in response to hyperglycemia, GRP78 is translocated to the cell surface in MCs. In support of these findings, csGRP78 is also present in the glomeruli of diabetic mice. In terms of its contribution to DN, csGRP78 drives the production of ECM by HG. These data suggest that csGRP78 represents a novel potential therapeutic target for DN.

Using a biotinylation/streptavidin pulldown technique, we first sought whether we could identify cell surface expression of GRP78. Fig. 1A shows that HG induced persistent cell surface expression of GRP78, seen as early as 3 h. The cell surface protein platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) was used as a loading control. For subsequent experiments, csGRP78 was assessed after 24 h of HG. Fig. 1B shows that only HG, but not the osmotic control mannitol, induced cell surface expression of GRP78. We next used flow cytometry to confirm that HG induces expression of GRP78 at the cell surface (Fig. 1, C and D). Cell surface translocation of GRP78 has been suggested to occur because of ER stress, although its movement to the surface can occur independently of ER stress (12Zhang Y. Liu R. Ni M. Gill P.

Similar to these studies, we found that HG induced ER stress in MCs, characterized by phosphorylation of eIF2α at early time points (3–12 h), as well as expression of CHOP and GRP78 (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, we found that HG-induced cell surface expression of GRP78 depended on ER stress.

Lastly, the protein DnaJ-like protein 1 (MTJ-1) has been shown to act as a co-chaperone for translocation of GRP78 to the cell surface (7Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V.

We found that knockdown of MTJ-1 prevented translocation of GRP78 to the cell surface in response to HG (Fig. 1G). These data demonstrate that, in MCs, HG induces cell surface expression of GRP78 in an ER stress–dependent manner through MTJ-1.

We thus used three distinct methods to inhibit csGRP78 to determine whether this would attenuate FAK and Akt activation by HG. Antibodies that bind to either the N-terminal or C-terminal portion of GRP78 are commonly used to assess effects on csGRP78 signaling (23Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V.

In cancer cells, C terminus–binding antibodies have been reported to inhibit Akt activation and induce apoptosis (23Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V.

Cuchacovich M. Llanos C. Urzua C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro is modulated by antibodies against glucose-regulated protein 78 isolated from patient serum.Cancer Res. 2006; 66 (17145889): 11424-1143110.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, antibodies targeting either the N or C terminus of GRP78 attenuated FAK and Akt activation in response to HG, as assessed by their phosphorylation on Tyr-397 and Ser-473, respectively (Fig. 2A). Of note, using a lactate dehydrogenase assay, we did not detect any apoptosis in MCs treated with either antibody (data not shown). The enzyme SubA is a cell-impermeable proteinase that selectively cleaves the C terminus of cell surface GRP78, whereas the SubAA272 mutant lacks proteinase activity and serves as a control for the active enzyme (27Ray R. de Ridder G.G. Eu J.P. Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Pizzo S.V. The Escherichia coli subtilase cytotoxin A subunit specifically cleaves cell-surface GRP78 protein and abolishes COOH-terminal-dependent signaling.J. Biol.

In line with our previous results, SubA, but not the mutant form, attenuated HG-induced FAK and Akt activation (Fig. 2B). Because we and others have shown that MTJ 1 is required for translocation of GRP78 to the cell surface (7Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. The role of MTJ-1 in cell surface translocation of GRP78, a receptor for α2-macroglobulin-dependent signaling.J. Immunol. 2005; 174 (15699139): 2092-209710.4049/jimmunol.174.4.2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we tested the effects of MTJ-1 knockdown on activation of Akt and FAK. Knockdown of MTJ-1 using siRNA also attenuated HG-induced FAK and Akt activation (Fig. 2C). Together, our data suggest that csGRP78 is an upstream regulator of FAK and Akt activation in response to HG in MCs. Integrin β1 is a cell surface receptor that mediates cell–matrix adhesion through formation of focal adhesion points (28Weston B.S. Wahab N.A. Mason R.M. CTGF mediates TGF-β-induced fibronectin matrix deposition by upregulating active α5β1 integrin in human mesangial cells.J. Am. Soc.

In colorectal tumor cells, csGRP78 interaction with integrin β1 promotes FAK activation, cell migration, and invasion (19Li Z. Zhang L. Zhao Y. Li H. Xiao H. Fu R. Zhao C. Wu H. Li Z. Cell-surface GRP78 facilitates colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2013; 45 (23485528): 987-99410.1016/j.biocel.2013.02.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HG has been shown to activate integrin β1 in MCs (29Miller C.G. Pozzi A. Zent R. Schwarzbauer J.E. Effects of high glucose on integrin activity and fibronectin matrix assembly by mesangial cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25 (24943838): 2342-235010.1091/mbc.e14-03-0800Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We thus assessed whether integrin β1 mediated FAK and Akt activation downstream of csGRP78 in response to HG. We first determined whether csGRP78 and integrin β1 interacted. Because coimmunoprecipitation following cell surface protein biotinylation is challenging, requiring harsh conditions to release the biotin bond (30Holman D. Henley J.M. A novel method for monitoring the cell surface expression of heteromeric protein complexes in dispersed neurons and acute hippocampal slices.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2007; 160 (17083981): 302-30810.1016/j.jneumeth.2006.09.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we isolated plasma membrane proteins as described under “Experimental procedures.” From this, we immunoprecipitated GRP78 and assessed for interaction with integrin β1 by immunoblotting. Fig. 3A shows that HG increased association between integrin β1 and GRP78 derived from the plasma membrane fraction. This was associated with an increased amount of GRP78 pulled down from plasma membrane preparations after HG treatment, consistent with increased csGRP78 in response to HG, as seen in Fig. 1. To further confirm an association between csGRP78 and integrin β1, we incubated live cells with the GRP78 antibody after HG treatment to immunoprecipitate csGRP78. Fig. 3B shows increased GRP78/integrin β1 association, which was also confirmed by reverse immunoprecipitation with the integrin β1 antibody (Fig. 3C). Because antibodies targeting either the N or C terminus of GRP78 attenuated FAK and Akt activation, we next determined their effects on HG-induced integrin β1–csGRP78 association. Fig. 3D shows that the C-terminal antibody C20 prevents their association, whereas the N-terminal antibody N20 was only partially effective. Further confirming that the C terminus of GRP78 is required for this association, Fig. 3E shows that SubA also prevents integrin β1–csGRP78 association in response to HG. These findings suggest an important role for the C terminus of csGRP78 in mediating FAK and Akt activation through association with integrin β1, whereas contribution from the N terminus of csGRP78 is independent of this integrin. Finally, to confirm that integrin β1 is required for FAK–Akt activation in response to HG, we determined the effect of inhibiting integrin β1 with the CD29 neutralizing antibody. Fig. 4A shows that this attenuated HG-mediated activation of both FAK and Akt. However, the non-neutralizing antibody to integrin β1 had no effect on either Akt or FAK activation by HG (Fig. 4B), suggesting that integrin β1 activity, in addition to its interaction with csGRP78, is required for downstream signaling. Fig. 4C confirms that inhibition of FAK with PF573228 prevents HG-induced Akt activation. These data support an important role for csGRP78 interaction with integrin β1 in downstream activation of FAK and Akt. Accumulation of ECM in the glomerulus is a classic pathological hallmark of DN (1Brosius 3rd, F.C. New insights into the mechanisms of fibrosis and sclerosis in diabetic nephropathy.Rev. Endocr.

In response to HG, MCs produce ECM proteins present in diabetic glomeruli, including collagens and fibronectin (20Wu D. Peng F. Zhang B. Ingram A.J. Gao B. Krepinsky J.C.

Krepinsky J.C. Collagen I induction by high glucose levels is mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signalling in mesangial cells.Diabetologia. 2007; 50 (17622510): 2008-201810.1007/s00125-007-0721-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Li R.

Cell Sci. 2018; 131 (29361535)jcs20862910.1242/jcs.208629Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We thus assessed the effects of blocking csGRP78 on HG-induced ECM up-regulation. Fig. 5A shows that both collagen I and fibronectin production in response to HG were blocked by pretreatment with either N- or C-terminal targeting csGRP78 antibodies, with no effect seen when using a control IgG (Fig. 5A). Similarly, SubA cleavage of the C terminus of csGRP78 or knockdown of the chaperone protein MTJ-1 prevented HG-induced collagen I and fibronectin up-regulation (Fig. 5, B and C). These results demonstrate an important role for csGRP78 in HG-induced induction of ECM protein synthesis in MCs. To assess the in vivo relevance of csGRP78 to DN, we sought to determine whether GRP78 was translocated to the cell surface in diabetic kidneys. We examined kidneys in two models of type I diabetes: induced by streptozotocin in CD-1 mice and in genetic model Akita mice. Our previous studies showed that induction of type 1 diabetes in CD-1 mice with streptozotocin produces robust changes in DN (32Van Krieken R. Marway M. Parthasarathy P. Mehta N. Ingram A.J. Gao B. Krepinsky J.C. Inhibition of SREBP with fatostatin does not attenuate early diabetic nephropathy in male mice.Endocrinology. 2018; 159 (29420703): 1479-149510.1210/en.2018-00093Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After 12 weeks of diabetes in this model, we assessed expression of GRP78 by IHC. Fig. 6A shows an increase in plasma membrane GRP78 in mesangial areas of glomeruli in diabetic kidneys. The staining pattern suggested expression of GRP78 at the plasma membrane, as indicated by black arrows. To provide further evidence of expression of GRP78 at the plasma membrane of MC in diabetic mice, we colocalized the expression of GRP78 with the plasma membrane and cell surface marker α8-integrin by immunofluorescence. Areas showing colocalization between GRP78 and α8-integrin are expressed as white in the mask. We found that there was increased colocalization between GRP78 and α8-integrin in diabetic mice, suggesting that GRP78 is up-regulated at the mesangial cell plasma membrane during pathogenesis of DN (Fig. 6B). To confirm these findings in CD-1 mice, we next assessed a second model of type 1 diabetes. Akita mice carry a mutation in the Ins2 gene, leading to improper formation of insulin and pancreatic β-cell injury, resulting in type 1 diabetes (34Alpers C.E. Hudkins K.L. Mouse models of diabetic nephropathy.Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2011; 20 (21422926): 278-28410.1097/MNH.0b013e3283451901Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Similar to CD-1 diabetic mice, Akita mice demonstrated overall increased expression of GRP78 in their glomeruli as well as surrounding tubules, as determined by IHC (Fig. 7A). MC plasma membrane GRP78 expression was assessed next, as above, through colocalization between GRP78 and α8-integrin expression by immunofluorescence. Similar to the CD-1 diabetic mice, plasma membrane GRP78 expression was increased in glomeruli of diabetic mice in MC areas (Fig. 7B). Finally, to further confirm these findings, we stained live kidney tissue obtained from freshly isolated WT and Akita kidneys. Here we again used α8-integrin as a cell surface marker for MCs, which was also used to identify glomeruli (35Hartner A. Marek I. Cordasic N. Haas C. Schocklmann H. Hulsmann-Volkert G. Plasa I.

Targeting SET with a sphingolipid analog drug fingolimod (FTY720) or ceramide leads to the reactivation of tumor suppressor PP2A. However, molecular details of the SET-FTY720 or SET-ceramide, and mechanism of FTY720-dependent PP2A activation, remain unknown. Here, we report the first in solution examination of the SET-FTY720 or SET-ceramide complexes by NMR spectroscopy. FTY720-ceramide binding resulted in chemical shifts of residues residing at the N terminus of SET, preventing its dimerization or oligomerization. This then released SET from PP2ACα, resulting in PP2A activation, while monomeric SET remained associated with the B56γ. Our data also suggest that the PP2A holoenzyme, composed of PP2A-Aβ, PP2A-B56γ, and PP2ACα subunits, is selectively activated in response to the formation of the SET-FTY720 complex in A549 cells. Various PP2A-associated downstream effector proteins in the presence or absence of FTY720 were then identified by stable isotope labeling with amino cells in cell culture, including tumor suppressor nonmuscle myosin IIA. Attenuation of FTY720-SET association by point mutations of residues that are involved in FTY720 binding or dephosphorylation of SET at Serine 171, enhanced SET oligomerization and the formation of the SET-PP2A inhibitory complex, leading to resistance to FTY720-dependent PP2A activation.—De Palma, R.

https://openalex.org/W2924859841,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing β cells. Recent studies showed that in addition to malaria, artemisinin and its derivative, artesunate (AS), could alleviate several autoimmune diseases. However, whether AS has a role in the prevention or treatment of T1D is still unknown. Therefore, in this study we administrated AS or DMSO in the drinking water of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a mouse model of T1D. We found that AS administration significantly prevented the incidence of T1D. The frequency of IL-4—producing CD4+ single-positive T cells and CD8+ T cells was significantly elevated, and IFN-γ—producing T cells were reduced in the spleen and pancreatic lymph nodes. In the pancreas, the skewing to IL-4—producing T cells was also observed. In addition, more regulatory T cells were found in the pancreas. mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6, were decreased. In addition, AS administration promoted the functional maturity of β cells in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that AS administration can prevent T1D in NOD mice mainly by reducing autoimmune T cells and increasing protective T cells. Our data constitute the first functional study of AS in T1D, which may provide a new rationale for future translational studies.—Li, Z., Shi, X., Liu, J., Shao, F., Huang, G., Zhou, Z., Zheng, P.

The purpose of present study was to evaluate the effects and to clarify the mechanism of low-intensity endurance exercise on cancer cachexia–induced muscle atrophy. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control (Cont), Cont plus exercise (Ex), AH130-induced cancer cachexia (AH130), and AH130 plus Ex. Cancer cachexia was induced by intraperitoneal injections with AH130 Yoshida ascites hepatoma cells; we analyzed the changes in muscle mass and the gene and protein expression levels of major regulators or indicators of skeletal muscle protein degradation and synthesis pathway in the soleus muscles. Low-intensity exercise inhibited the muscle mass loss through a suppression of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and phosphorylated AMPK, and inhibited the deactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in the soleus muscle, which contributed to the prevention of cancer cachexia–induced muscle atrophy.

Existing segmentation and tracking algorithms either require additional dyes or markers specific to segmentation or they are highly specific to one imaging condition and cell morphology and/or necessitate manual correction. Here we introduce a fully automated, fast and robust segmentation and tracking algorithm for budding yeast that overcomes these limitations. Full automatization is achieved through a novel automated seeding method, which first generates coarse seeds, then automatically fine-tunes cell boundaries using these seeds and automatically corrects segmentation mistakes. Our algorithm can accurately segment and track individual yeast cells without any specific dye or biomarker. Moreover, we show how existing channels devoted to a biological process of interest can be used to improve the segmentation. The algorithm is versatile in that it accurately segments not only cycling cells with smooth elliptical shapes, but also cells with arbitrary morphologies (e.g. sporulating and pheromone treated cells). In addition, the algorithm is independent of the specific imaging method (bright-field/phase) and objective used (40X/63X/100X). We validate our algorithm's performance on 9 cases each entailing a different imaging condition, objective magnification and/or cell morphology. Taken together, our algorithm presents a powerful segmentation and tracking tool that can be adapted to numerous budding yeast single-cell studies."

This study examined changes in unemployment benefit claims filings in Philadelphia compared to its neighboring counties two years prior to and 14 months post implementation of a 1.5 cents per ounce excise tax on sugar- and artificially-sweetened beverages.Data were obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Labor. Interrupted time series analysis was used to determine if there was a change in new monthly unemployment claims filings post-tax implementation in Philadelphia compared to surrounding counties in supermarkets, select potentially affected industries, and in total claims filings across all industries combined.Results showed there were no statistically significant changes to unemployment claims in Philadelphia compared to neighboring counties for supermarkets (ß = -9.45, 95% CI = -98.11, 79.22), soft drink manufacturers (ß = -0.13, 95% CI = -9.13, 8.88), across other potentially affected industries (ß = 9.16, 95% CI = -488.29, 506.60), or across all industries (ß = -445.85, 95% CI = -4272.39, 3380.68) following implementation of the beverage tax. Unemployment declined similarly in Philadelphia compared to surrounding counties.Public reports of increased unemployment within the first year following the implementation of the Philadelphia beverage tax are not supported by this analysis. Future work should examine employment outcomes and include longer follow-up periods."
https://openalex.org/W2950739346,"There is converging evidence that distinct neuronal processes leave distinguishable footprints in the laminar BOLD response. However, even though the achievable spatial resolution in functional MRI has much improved over the years, it is still challenging to separate signals arising from different cortical layers. In this work, we propose a new method to extract laminar signals. We use a spatial General Linear Model in combination with the equivolume principle of cortical layers to unmix laminar signals instead of interpolating through and integrating over a cortical area: thus reducing partial volume effects. Not only do we provide a mathematical framework for extracting laminar signals with a spatial GLM, we also illustrate that the best case scenarios of existing methods can be seen as special cases within the same framework. By means of simulation, we show that this approach has a sharper point spread function, providing better signal localisation. We further assess the partial volume contamination in cortical profiles from high resolution human ex vivo and in vivo structural data, and provide a full account of the benefits and potential caveats. We eschew here any attempt to validate the spatial GLM on the basis of fMRI data as a generally accepted ground-truth pattern of laminar activation does not currently exist. This approach is flexible in terms of the number of layers and their respective thickness, and naturally integrates spatial regularisation along the cortex, while preserving laminar specificity. Care must be taken, however, as this procedure of unmixing is susceptible to sources of noise in the data or inaccuracies in the laminar segmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2951806838,"Bibliometric indicators are increasingly used to evaluate individual scientists-as is exemplified by the popularity of the many other publication and citation-based indicators used in evaluation. These indicators, however, cover at best some of the quality dimensions relevant for assessing a researcher: productivity and impact. At the same time, research quality has more dimensions than productivity and impact alone. As current bibliometric indicators are not covering various important quality dimensions, we here contribute to developing better indicators for those quality dimensions not yet addressed. One of the quality dimensions lacking valid indicators is an individual researcher's independence. We propose indicators to measure different aspects of independence: two assessing whether a researcher has developed an own collaboration network and two others assessing the level of thematic independence. Taken together they form an independence indicator. We illustrate how these indicators distinguish between researchers that are equally productive and have a considerable impact. The independence indicator is a step forward in evaluating individual scholarly quality."
https://openalex.org/W2925015811,"Human amnion fibroblasts produce abundant prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which plays a crucial role in parturition by stimulating not only myometrial contraction and cervical ripening but also the expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in PGE2 synthesis-namely, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). This feed-forward induction of COX-2 expression by PGE2 is mediated via its receptors coupled with the cAMP and PKA pathway and subsequent phosphorylation of the transcription factors cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Although prostaglandin E receptor (EP)-2 and EP4 for PGE2 are coupled with activation of the cAMP and PKA pathway, the exact roles of these 2 receptors in the regulation of COX-2 expression in amnion fibroblasts remain to be determined. Here, we clarify this issue by employing human amnion tissue and fibroblasts with the long-term objective of specific targeting of prostaglandin synthesis in prevention of preterm birth. We find that an EP2 agonist caused long-lasting increases in CREB phosphorylation and COX-2 expression, whereas an EP4 agonist induced only transient increases in CREB phosphorylation and COX-2 expression in amnion fibroblasts. Moreover, only EP2 stimulation increased STAT3 phosphorylation, whereas only EP4 stimulation increased PI3K activity. EP4 antagonist or inhibition of PI3K enhanced the induction of CREB and STAT3 phosphorylation and COX-2 expression by PGE2 or EP2 stimulation, which was attenuated by EP4 overexpression. Of interest, PGE2 and cortisol, both well-demonstrated stimulants of COX-2 expression in amnion fibroblasts, increased EP2 but decreased EP4 receptor expression. Furthermore, increased EP2 but decreased EP4 abundance were observed in amnion tissue at parturition. We conclude that EP2 and EP4 receptors play different roles in the regulation of COX-2 expression in human amnion fibroblasts. EP2 is the dominant PGE2 receptor mediating the induction of COX-2 at parturition, which can be attenuated by simultaneous activation of PI3K coupled to the EP4 receptor.-Lu, J.-W., Wang, W.-S., Zhou, Q., Gan, X.-W., Myatt, L., Sun, K.

https://openalex.org/W2924603668,"Biologic activity of proteases is mainly characterized by the substrate specificity, tissue distribution, and cellular localization. The human metalloproteases meprin α and meprin β share 41% sequence identity and exhibit a similar cleavage specificity with a preference for negatively charged amino acids. However, shedding of meprin α by furin on the secretory pathway makes it a secreted enzyme in comparison with the membrane-bound meprin β. In this study, we identified human meprin α and meprin β as forming covalently linked membrane-tethered heterodimers in the early endoplasmic reticulum, thereby preventing furin-mediated secretion of meprin α. Within this newly formed enzyme complex, meprin α was able to be activated on the cell surface and detected by cleavage of a novel specific fluorogenic peptide substrate. However, the known meprin β substrates amyloid precursor protein and CD99 were not shed by membrane-tethered meprin α. On the other hand, being linked to meprin α, activation of or substrate cleavage by meprin β on the cell surface was not altered. Interestingly, proteolytic activity of both proteases was increased in the heteromeric complex, indicating an increased proteolytic potential at the plasma membrane. Because meprins are susceptibility genes for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to investigate the physiologic impact of the enzyme complex, we performed transcriptome analyses of intestinal mucosa from meprin-knockout mice. Comparison of the transcriptional gene analysis data with gene analyses of IBD patients revealed that different gene subsets were dysregulated if meprin α was expressed alone or in the enzyme complex, demonstrating the physiologic and pathophysiological relevance of the meprin heterodimer formation.—Peters, F., Scharfenberg, F., Colmorgen, C., Armbrust, F., Wiehert, R., Arnold, P., Potempa, B., Potempa, J., Pietrzik, C.

https://openalex.org/W2925139175,"Objectives Recent studies reported that several gait parameters were associated with lower cognitive function or cognitive decline, however, known gait parameters were limited and no study has used large-scale data. We identified the characteristics for gait parameters of community-dwelling elderly Japanese with lower cognitive function. Methods 1,240 community-dwelling adults (mean [SD] age, 77.2 [4.8] years; women, 59.4%) aged 70 or older participated in geriatric health assessments in 2016. We measured comprehensive gait parameters using resistive pressure platform. Cognition was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results There are possible correlations between gait measures (gait speed, stride length, step length, step width, average foot pressure, double support duration, and single support duration) and CVs (CV of stride length, step length, average foot pressure, and single support duration) with MMSE score, respectively. After adjustment for important confounders, multiple regression models showed that gait speed (β = .080, p = 0.006), stride length (β = .123, p<0.001), step length (β = .123, p<0.001), average foot pressure (β = .060, p = 0.040), double support duration (β = -.082, p = 0.004), single support duration (β = .086, p = 0.003), CV of stride length (β = -.091, p<0.001), CV of step length (β = -.090, p<0.001), and CV of single support duration (β = -.058, p = 0.037) had significant association with MMSE score, respectively. Conclusions Our findings suggest that person with lower cognitive function tend to have unsteady gait such as erratic length and time of one step, in addition to decreasing the vertical displacement of the center of gravity and slower speed."
https://openalex.org/W2924499766,"Abydos is a large, complex archaeological site located approximately 500 km south of Cairo in Upper Egypt. The site has served as a cemetery for thousands of years and is where most of the Early Dynastic royal tombs are located. North Abydos includes the Middle Cemetery and the North Cemetery, which are separated from each other by a wadi. The Middle Cemetery was the burial ground for important Sixth Dynasty (2407–2260 BC) officials and over time for thousands of elite and non-elite individuals as well. Excavations at the core area of the Old Kingdom mortuary landscape have revealed many culturally important wooden objects but these are often found with extensive deterioration that can compromise their preservation. The objectives of this study were to characterize the biodegradation that has taken place in excavated wooden objects, elucidate the type of wood degradation present, obtain information on soil properties at the site and identify fungi currently associated with the wood and soils. Light and scanning electron microscopy studies were used to observe the micromorphological characteristics of the wood, and culturing on different media was done to isolate fungi. Identification of the fungi was done by examining morphological characteristics and extracting rDNA from pure cultures and sequencing the ITS region. Wooden objects, made from Cedrus, Juniperus and Acacia as well as several unidentified hardwoods, were found with extensive degradation and were exceedingly fragile. Termite damage was evident and frass from the subterranean termites along with sand particles were present in most woods. Evidence of soft rot attack was found in sections of wood that remained. Fungi isolated from wood and soils were identified as species of Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Penicillium, Stemphylium Talaromyces and Trichoderma. Results provide important information on the current condition of the wood and gives insights to the identity of the fungi in wood and soils at the site. These results provide needed information to help develop conservation plans to preserve these degraded and fragile wooden objects."

Students' proficiency was evaluated on a 6-minute test in which they were required to demonstrate 32 predetermined anatomic landmarks spread across the 6 views and ranked on a 0-100 scale according to a predetermined key.The 6-minute test final grade displayed superiority of group A over group B (54±17 vs. 39±21, respectively [p = 0.001]). This trend was continuous across all 6 main views: PLAV (69±18 vs. 54±23, respectively), PSAV (65±33 vs. 41±32, respectively), 4ch (57±19 vs. 43±26, respectively), 2ch (37±29 vs. 33±27, respectively), 3ch (48±23 vs. 35±25, respectively), and SC (36±27 vs. 24±28, respectively).Teaching medical students CU imaging acquisition by qualified classmates is feasible.

Herein, we investigated the bioactive lipid mediator profiles of tendon-derived stromal cells isolated from patients with Achilles tendinopathy (AT) or Achilles rupture (AR) under baseline and IL-1β-stimulated conditions. We also determined whether incubating these cells with 2 of the mediators produced by tendon-derived stromal cells, 15-epi-Lipoxin A4 (15-epi-LXA4) or maresin (MaR)-1, moderated their proinflammatory phenotype. Under baseline conditions, AT cells showed concurrent increased levels of proinflammatory eicosanoids and proresolving mediators compared with AR cells. IL-1β treatment induced profound prostaglandin E2 release in AR compared with AT cells. Incubation of IL-1β treated AT and AR tendon-derived stromal cells in 15-epi-LXA4 or MaR1 reduced proinflammatory eicosanoids and potentiated the release of proresolving mediators. These mediators also induced specialized proresolving mediator (SPM) biosynthetic enzymes arachidonate lipoxygenase (ALOX) 12 and ALOX15 and up-regulated the proresolving receptor ALX compared with vehicle-treated cells. Incubation in 15-epi-LXA4 or MaR1 also moderated the proinflammatory phenotype of AT and AR cells, regulating podoplanin, CD90, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1, IL-6, IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 5, and TLR4 and suppressed c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2/3, Lyn, STAT-3, and STAT-6 phosphokinase signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2923414801,"Increased formation of brown and beige adipocytes is critical for adaptive thermogenesis to maintain homeothermy in cold or to circumvent diet-induced obesity (DIO). Cellular repressor of adenovirus early region 1A-stimulated genes 1 (CREG1) exhibits the ability to stimulate brown adipogenesis, including the induction of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), in vitro. Thus, we aimed to clarify whether CREG1 promotes brown adipocyte formation and inhibits DIO at the whole-animal level. In mouse brown adipose tissue (BAT), CREG1 expression was markedly increased in cold but was decreased under thermoneutrality, suggesting CREG1 involvement in BAT thermogenesis. Moreover, in BAT and white adipose tissue, expression of UCP1 and fibroblast growth factor-21 and browning were both significantly higher in adipocyte P2-Cregl-transgenic (Tg) mice than in wild-type (WT) littermates. Following stimulation with a β3-adrenergic agonist, energy consumption was elevated in the Tg mice, which showed increased resistance to DIO and improvement of obesity-associated complications including fatty liver relative to WT mice. The CREG1 stimulatory effect on brown adipogenesis was confirmed in Tg-BAT primary cultures. It was also found that CREG1 binds to retinoid X receptor α, which interacts with thyroid hormone receptor for brown adipogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that CREG1 stimulates brown adipocyte formation and browning, ameliorating obesity and its related pathology in vivo.—Hashimoto, M., Kusudo, T., Takeuchi, T., Kataoka, N., Mukai, T., Yamashita, H.

All four communities received routine government HIV care services.Using household census data we randomly selected a cohort of consenting residents aged ≥18 years. A baseline sero-survey in July 2014 was followed by two repeat surveys in March and December 2015. We measured uptake of HIV prevention methods, loss-to-follow-up and HIV incidence, accounting for multistage survey design.A total of 862 participants were enrolled and followed for 15 months. Participation was 62% and 74% in the control and intervention arms respectively; Overall loss to follow up (LTFU) was 21.6% and was similar by arm. Self-reported abstinence/faithfulness increased between baseline and endline in both arms from 53% to 73% in the control arm, and 55% to 67% in the intervention arm.

https://openalex.org/W2924710783,"Coping has been extensively studied in health psychology; however, factors influencing the usage of different coping strategies have received limited attention. In five studies (N = 3702), we explored the relationship between trait empathy and coping strategies, and how subjective socioeconomic status (SES) moderates this relationship. In Studies 1-4, we found that people with higher level of empathic concern use more adaptive coping strategies, seek more social support, and use fewer maladaptive coping strategies. Moreover, higher trait empathy related to more adaptive coping strategies among the poor, and fewer maladaptive coping strategies among the rich. In Study 5, we tested the potential biological basis of the relationship between trait empathy and coping by examining the effect of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) rs53576 polymorphism on coping. We found that individuals with the GG phenotype-who in previous research have been found to be more empathic-were more likely to seek social support than AG or AA individuals. Furthermore, in line with findings in Studies 1-4, amongst people with low SES, individuals with GG genotype used more adaptive coping strategies than AG or AA individuals. Our results highlight the selective role trait empathy plays in influencing coping strategy deployment, depending on the SES of individuals."

Visual acuity was tested using a miniature Snellen eye chart under five different settings (naked eye; simple loupe; Galilean loupe; Keplerian loupe and an operating microscope). Photographs were taken during the visual acuity exam in order to evaluate the angulation of the subjects’ necks in a neutral posture. The two-factor analysis of variance and the Games-Howell post-hoc test were performed (α = 0.05). A significant difference in visual acuity and neck angulation was found between the ""magnification device"" and ""distance"" factors in each of the graduating classes analyzed (p<0.05). At a standardized distance, the Keplerian loupe (535.93±133.69), the Galilean loupe (514.06±171.56), and the operating microscope (517.71±161.61) all provided greater visual acuity.

Understanding the main demographical risk factors for disease characteristics of EPTB plays a crucial role in speeding up diagnosis process and improving overall clinical experience. The aim of this study was to investigate the main demographical and clinical risk factors for EPTB among adults and adolescents for the first time in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out on a collection of 902 extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates with demographical and clinical data. All isolates were subjected to spoligotyping and 24-loci based MIRU-VNTR typing. The association between two potential variables was assessed using odd ratios (OR) calculations. Independent risk factors for EPTB and diseases characteristics of EPTB were identified using multivariate regression model analyses. Gender was found to be significantly associated with lymph node, gastrointestinal, central nervous system and urogenital TB. Lymph node TB showed statistical association to age group below 25 years, non-Saudis and South East Asian ethnicity. While gastrointestinal TB demonstrated an association with patients above 60 years old, and Saudis. Multivariate analysis showed that gender is an independent risk factor to urogenital TB (p 0.03) and lymph node TB (p 0.005). On the other hands, South Asian (p 0.01) and South East Asian (p 0.03) ethnicities were both identified as independent risk factors significantly associated with EPTB.

https://openalex.org/W2923711499,"Objectives To test the heterogeneity of the effect of a change in pharmaceutical cost-sharing by therapeutic groups in a Spanish region. Methods Data: random sample (provided by the Canary Islands Health Service) of 40,471 people covered by the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) in the Canary Islands. The database includes individualised monthly-dispensed medications (prescribed by the SNHS) from one year before (August 2011) to one year after (June 2013) the Royal Decree Law 16/2012 (RDL 16/2012). Sample: two intervention groups (low-income pensioners and middle-income working population) and one control group (low-income working population). Empirical model: quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design to study the change in consumption (measured in number of monthly Defined Daily Dose (DDDs) per individual) among 13 therapeutic groups. The policy break indicator (three-level categorical variable) tested the existence of stockpiling between the reform’s announcement and its implementation. We ran 16 linear regression models (general, by therapeutic groups and by comorbidities) that considered whether the exclusion of some drugs from public provision impacted on consumption more than the co-payment increase. Results General: Reduction (-13.04) in consumption after the reform’s implementation, which was fully compensated by a previous increase (16.60 i.e., stockpiling) among low-income pensioners. The middle-income working population maintained its trend of increasing consumption. Therapeutic groups: Reductions in consumption after the reform’s implementation among low-income pensioners in 7 of the 13 groups, which were fully compensated for by a previous increase (i.e., stockpiling) in 4 groups and partially compensated for in the remaining 3. The analysis without the excluded medicines provided fewer negative coefficients. Comorbidities: Reduction in consumption that was only slightly compensated for by a previous increase (i.e., stockpiling). Conclusions The negative impact of cost-sharing produced, among low-income pensioners, a risk of loss of adherence to treatments, which could deteriorate the health status of individuals, especially among pensioners within the most inelastic therapeutic groups (associated with chronic diseases) and patients with comorbidities (also, associated with chronic diseases). Notwithstanding the above, this risk was more related to the exclusion of some drugs from provision than to the cost-sharing increase."

https://openalex.org/W2924574072,"Sour rot is a disease complex produced by an interaction between grape berries and various species of yeast and acetic acid bacteria in the presence of Drosophila fruit flies. While yeast and bacteria are consistently found on healthy grape berries worldwide, we explored whether the composition of these epiphytic communities differed depending on the presence or absence of sour rot symptoms. Using high-throughput sequencing, we characterized the microbiome of sour rot-affected grapes from two geographical areas across two years. In 2015 and 2016, both healthy and sour rot-affected berries were collected from commercial and research vineyards in Geneva, NY and commercial vineyards in Tasmania, AUS. In this experiment, all associated organisms grouped together primarily by location, and not by presence/absence of symptoms or cultivar. The predominant difference between asymptomatic and symptomatic samples, regardless of location, was the abundance of Acetobacter species, which were significantly more plentiful in the symptomatic samples. Yeast genera such as Candida, Hanseniaspora, Pichia and Saccharomyces were abundant in both sets of samples, but varied by region. The consistent presence of yeast species and the increased abundance of acetic acid-generating bacteria is consistent with our understanding of their etiological role in sour rot development. In 2016, diseased grapes also were collected from vineyards in Fredonia, NY, and Modesto, CA. Consistent with our comparison study, all associated organisms again grouped together primarily by location. Yeast genera such as Candida, Hanseniaspora, Pichia and Saccharomyces were abundant in both sets of samples, but varied by region.

Almost all rifaximin resistant strains possessed multiple mutations with more than three mutations within rpoB including the most frequent novel mutations of S352L, I2726L, and V2465A. There was a significant association between vacA genotype and rifaximin resistance (P = 0.042). Among 23 levofloxacin-resistant strains, 82.6% (19/23, P <0.001) were also resistant to garenoxacin, and 39.1% (9/23) had a high minimal inhibitory concentration ≥8 μg/mL with positive trend correlation (P = <0.001, r = 0.84). Among 19 garenoxacin resistant strains, 16 (84.2%) contained mutations at D91 and N87 of gyrA. In conclusion, sitafloxacin, rifabutin, and furazolidone might be considered as alternative antibiotics to be included in H. pylori eradication regimen in regions with high prevalence of levofloxacin and metronidazole resistance, such as the Dominican Republic."
https://openalex.org/W2923378509,"This study examines the relationship between regulatory B (Breg) and T (Treg) compartments, which play crucial roles in the maintenance of immune homeostasis in the context of HIV. Using flow cytometry, the phenotypes of different Breg and Treg subsets from HIV-infected and healthy individuals were analyzed, along with the suppressive capacity of Breg. Peripheral blood samples of thirteen HIV+ treatment-naïve individuals, fourteen treated-HIV+ individuals with undetectable viral load and twelve healthy individuals were analyzed. The absolute counts of Breg and Treg subsets were decreased in HIV+ treatment-naïve individuals in comparison to treated-HIV+ and healthy individuals. Interestingly, correlations between Breg subsets (CD24hiCD27+ and PD-L1+ B cells) and IL-10-producing Breg observed in healthy individuals were lost in HIV+ treatment-naïve individuals. However, a correlation between frequencies of CD24hiCD38hi or TIM-1+-Breg subsets and Treg was observed in HIV+ treatment-naïve individuals and not in healthy individuals. Therefore, we hypothesized that various Breg subsets might have different functions during B and T-cell homeostasis during HIV-1 infection. In parallel, stimulated Breg from HIV-infected treatment-naïve individuals presented a decreased ability to suppress CD4+ T-cell proliferation in comparison to the stimulated Breg from treated-HIV+ or healthy individuals. We demonstrate a dysregulation between Breg and Treg subsets in HIV-infected individuals, which might participate in the hyper-activation and exhaustion of the immune system that occurs in such patients."
https://openalex.org/W2922874377,"The theory of affordances states that perception is of environmental properties that are relevant to action-capabilities of perceivers. The present study illustrates how concepts and methodological tools from the theory of affordances may help to advance research in the field of sensory substitution. The sensory substitution device (SSD) that was used consisted of two horizontal rows of 12 coin motors that each vibrated as a function of the distance to the nearest object. Sixty blindfolded participants used the SSD to explore virtual horizontal apertures with different widths. They were asked to judge the passability of the apertures. Participants with narrow shoulders judged narrower apertures as passable than participants with wide shoulders. This difference disappeared when aperture width was scaled to shoulder width, demonstrating that perception was body scaled. The actual aperture width was closely related to aspects of the exploratory movements and to aspects of the vibrotactile stimulation that was obtained with the exploratory movements. This implies that the exploratory movements themselves and the vibrotactile stimulation were both informative about the aperture width, and hence that the perception of passability may have been based on either of them or on a global variable that spans vibrotactile as well as kinaesthetic stimulation. Similar performance was observed for participants who accomplished the 7-trial familiarization phase with or without vision, meaning that practice with vision is not indispensable to learn to use the SSD."
https://openalex.org/W2923168362,"Neurotensin is a peptide hormone released from enteroendocrine cells in the small intestine in response to fat ingestion. Although the mechanisms regulating neurotensin secretion are still incompletely understood, our recent findings implicate a role for extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 as positive regulators of free fatty acid-stimulated neurotensin secretion. Previous studies have shown that kinase suppressor of Ras 1 acts as a molecular scaffold of the Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 kinase cascade and regulates intensity and duration of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 signaling. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of kinase suppressor of Ras 1 attenuates neurotensin secretion and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 signaling in human endocrine cells. Conversely, we show that overexpression of kinase suppressor of Ras 1 enhances neurotensin secretion and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 signaling. We also show that inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 and exocyst complex component 70, a substrate of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 and mediator of secretory vesicle exocytosis, potently inhibits basal and docosahexaenoic acid-stimulated neurotensin secretion, whereas overexpression of exocyst complex component 70 enhances basal and docosahexaenoic acid-stimulated neurotensin secretion. Together, our findings demonstrate a role for kinase suppressor of Ras 1 as a positive regulator of neurotensin secretion from human endocrine cells and indicate that this effect is mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 signaling pathway. Moreover, we reveal a novel role for exocyst complex component 70 in regulation of neurotensin vesicle exocytosis through its interaction with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2924925288,"The endangered African wild dog (AWD; Lycaon pictus) is a highly social canid living in packs with a separate male and female hierarchy. Immobilisation, handling and translocations are acute stressors for AWDs, however such interventions are often needed for species management. In addition, new pack formation or temporary pack separation can lead to an increase in intra-pack aggression. The goal of this double-blinded placebo-controlled study conducted in captive zoo populations was to evaluate whether dog appeasing pheromone (DAP) reduces behavioural stress and faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels (fGCM) normally associated with pack separation, immobilisation and reintroduction (SIR), and to assess whether this reduces aggressive behaviours and faecal androgen metabolite levels (fAM). Four packs (n = 11 males) were treated with DAP and 4 packs (n = 12 males) were treated with a placebo solution, applied at the end of anaesthesia. Behavioural interactions as well as fGCM and fAM were determined from 3 days before until 4-6 days after SIR. No effect of DAP on fGCM was observed, however, fAM increased after SIR in placebo but not DAP treated animals. Moreover, on the day of reintroduction, DAP treated packs tended to have lower rates of contact-dominance and active-submission behaviour, but higher rates of non-contact dominance behaviour. As these effects could decrease the risk of agonistic interactions, DAP may be a useful tool to help manage new pack formations and temporary pack separation."
https://openalex.org/W2923394353,"Temperature and individual egg size have been long studied in the development of fishes because of their direct effects on individual fitness. Here we studied the combined effects of three important factors for fish development, i.e. egg size, social environment and water temperature. Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), a coldwater fish known to be phenotypically plastic, was used to investigate how these factors may affect growth and foraging behaviour of juvenile fish in a benign environment. We accounted for the social environment during early development by comparing fish raised in groups and in isolation. We examined the effect of egg size and a 2 °C difference on foraging behaviour, activity and growth a few weeks after first feeding. Growth trajectories of fish originating from large and small eggs were similar within each temperature: larger fish coming large eggs were at all time larger than smaller fish. There was no indication that small fish raised at a higher temperature grew faster than larger fish raised at a lower temperature. A 2 °C difference in temperature affected the behaviour of fish differently according to body size and/or social context. The foraging probability difference between fish raised in groups and fish briefly isolated was higher at 4.5 °C than at 6.5 °C for both size fish. Finally, there was no repeatability in foraging behaviour and mobility for isolated individuals. These results highlight the importance of small changes in temperature when evaluating growth and behaviour of fishes, and reveal the importance of considering the interaction of temperature with other factors, e.g. individual size and social environment, especially at early stages of development in fishes. We discuss these findings in the context of rapid changes in temperature and how temperature and its interaction with other factors may affect the phenotypes, ecology and evolution of coldwater fishes."
https://openalex.org/W2924158436,"Pharmaceutical interest in targeting mitochondria is increasing because of their contribution in incurable diseases. However, the inner mitochondrial layer represents a major hurdle to overcome for most drugs. Penetrating peptides are a promising strategy for drug delivery, but the absence of standard principles and reliable prediction tools limits the design and discovery of sequences with improved organelle specificity. In our hypothesis, peptide local flexibility represents a valuable source to predict peptide performance. Here, a pool of short nonnatural peptides was designed with the same amino acid content but different positioning. Molecular dynamics and membrane-transfer simulations were used to generate the low-energy conformers in extra, intracellular, and membrane-inserted environments. The contributions of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chain–exposed surfaces revealed that the amino acid's relative position significantly affected the simulated peptide's dynamics. Based on the structural versatility, we predicted the peptides' behavior and the sequence with the most efficient membrane penetration and mitochondrial localization. The prediction and the improved performance of our peptides were experimentally confirmed and compared with a reported mitochondrial-targeting sequence. We demonstrated that an accurate understanding of the structural versatility is a valid aid for future works in designing sequences with improved mitochondrial targeting.—Pirisinu, M., Blasco, P., Tian, X., Sen, Y., Bode, A.

https://openalex.org/W2925111307,"The soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex comprises synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP25), syntaxin-1a (syx-1), and synaptobrevin 2, which is essential for many physiologic processes requiring membrane fusion. Several studies imply that the loop region of SNAP25 plays important roles in SNARE-complex assembly. However, why and how the flexible loop facilitates the complex assembly remains poorly understood because it is purposely deleted in almost all structural studies. By using NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism spectropolarimetry, we characterized SNAP25 structure and interactions with other SNAREs in aqueous buffer and in the membrane. We found that the N-terminal of the SNAP25 loop region binds with membrane, and this interaction induced a disorder-to-order conformational change of the loop, resulting in enhanced interaction between the C-terminal of the SNAP25 loop and syx-1. We further proved that SNARE-complex assembly efficiency decreased when we disrupted the electrostatic interaction between C-terminal of the SNAP25 loop and syx-1, suggesting that the SNAP25 loop region facilitates SNARE-complex assembly through promoting prefusion SNARE binary complex formation. Our work elucidates the role of the flexible loop and the membrane environment in SNARE-complex assembly at the residue level, which helps to understand membrane fusion, a fundamental transport and communication process in cells.—Jiang, X., Zhang, Z., Cheng, K., Wu, Q., Jiang, L., Pielak, G.

https://openalex.org/W2914473467,"The lanthanides (Ln3+), or rare earth elements, have proven to be useful tools for biomolecular NMR, X-ray crystallographic, and fluorescence analyses due to their unique 4f orbitals. However, their utility in biological applications has been limited because site-specific incorporation of a chelating element is required to ensure efficient binding of the free Ln3+ ion. Additionally, current Ln3+ chelator syntheses complicate efforts to directly incorporate Ln3+ chelators into proteins as the multi-step processes and a reliance on organic solvents promote protein denaturation and aggregation which are generally incompatible with direct incorporation into the protein of interest. To overcome these limitations, herein we describe a two-step aqueous synthesis of a small molecule lanthanide chelating agent amenable to site-specific incorporation into a protein using copper-free click chemistry with unnatural amino acids. The bioconjugate combines a diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelating moiety with a clickable dibenzylcyclooctyne-amine (DBCO-amine) to facilitate the reaction with an azide containing unnatural amino acid. Incorporating the DBCO-amine avoids the use of the cytotoxic Cu2+ ion as a catalyst. The clickable lanthanide chelator (CLC) reagent reacted readily with p-azidophenylalanine (paF) without the need of a copper catalyst, thereby demonstrating proof-of-concept. Implementation of the orthogonal click chemistry reaction has the added advantage that the chelator can be used directly in a protein labeling reaction, without the need of extensive purification. Given the inherent advantages of Cu2+-free click chemistry, aqueous synthesis, and facile labeling, we believe that the CLC will find abundant use in both structural and biophysical studies of proteins and their complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2922543840,"We study computational approaches for detecting SNP-SNP interactions that are characterized by a set of ""two-locus, two-allele, two-phenotype and complete-penetrance"" disease models. We argue that existing methods, which use data to determine a best-fitting disease model for each pair of SNPs prior to screening, may be too greedy. We present a less greedy strategy which, for each given pair of SNPs, limits the number of candidate disease models to a set of prototypes determined a priori."
https://openalex.org/W2925023041,"This paper considers a novel dynamical behaviour of two microbial populations, competing in a chemostat over a single substrate, that is only possible through the use of population balance equations (PBEs). PBEs are partial integrodifferential equations that represent a distribution of cells according to some internal state, mass in our case. Using these equations, realistic parameter values and the assumption that one population can deploy an emergency mechanism, where it can change the mean mass of division and hence divide faster, we arrive at two different steady states, one oscillatory and one non-oscillatory both of which seem to be stable. A steady state of either form is normally either unstable or only attainable through external control (cycling the dilution rate). In our case no external control is used. Finally, in the oscillatory case we attempt to explain how oscillations appear in the biomass without any explicit dependence on the division rate (the function that oscillates) through the approximation of fractional moments as a combination of integer moments. That allows an implicit dependence of the biomass on the number of cells which in turn is directly dependent on the division rate function."
