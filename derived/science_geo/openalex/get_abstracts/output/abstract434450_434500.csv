https://openalex.org/W2055655674,"Neuroanatomically precise, genome-wide maps of transcript distributions are critical resources to complement genomic sequence data and to correlate functional and genetic brain architecture. Here we describe the generation and analysis of a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain, comprising extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray profiling of ∼900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously by anatomical location, with different regions and their constituent cell types displaying robust molecular signatures that are highly conserved between individuals. Analysis of differential gene expression and gene co-expression relationships demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly reflects the distributions of major cell classes such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex displays a relatively homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but with distinct features associated selectively with primary sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex is strongly reflected in its molecular topography-the closer two cortical regions, the more similar their transcriptomes. This freely accessible online data resource forms a high-resolution transcriptional baseline for neurogenetic studies of normal and abnormal human brain function."

Three centuries ago, Bishop Berkeley's 1710 classic “A treatise on the nature of human knowledge,” first spelled out the “correlation vs. causation” dilemma. Sugihara et al. (p. 496 , published online 20 September) present an approach to this conundrum, and extend current discussions about causation to dynamic systems with weak to moderate coupling (such as ecosystems). The resulting method, convergent cross mapping can detect causal linkages between time series."

https://openalex.org/W2045448404,"Much of the global burden of disease is associated with behaviors—overeating, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity—that people recognize as health-harming and yet continue to engage in, even when undesired consequences emerge. To date, interventions aimed at changing such behaviors have largely encouraged people to reflect on their behaviors. These approaches are often ineffectual, which is in keeping with the observation that much human behavior is automatic, cued by environmental stimuli, resulting in actions that are largely unaccompanied by conscious reflection. We propose that interventions targeting these automatic bases of behaviors may be more effective. We discuss specific interventions and suggest ways to determine whether and how interventions that target automatic processes can enhance global efforts to prevent disease."

Ludwig et al. (p. 1505 ; see the Perspective by Sampson ) describe the analysis, 10 to 15 years onward, of a large-scale social experiment carried out in five U.S. cities in the mid 1990s. Several thousand residents of poor neighborhoods were given housing vouchers that could only be used if they moved into much less poor neighborhoods. In comparison to a similar group of individuals who did not move, those who did experienced substantial improvement in their subjective well-being."
https://openalex.org/W2136969710,"Fixing on a Marine Partnership Nitrogen fixation by microorganisms determines the productivity of the biosphere. Although plants photosynthesize by virtue of the ancient incorporation of cyanobacteria to form chloroplasts, no equivalent endosymbiotic event has occurred for nitrogen fixation. Nevertheless, in terrestrial environments, nitrogen-fixing symbioses between bacteria and plants, for example, are common. Thompson et al. (p. 1546 ) noticed that the ubiquitous marine cyanobacterium UCYN-A has an unusually streamlined genome lacking components of the photosynthetic machinery and central carbon metabolism—all suggestive of being an obligate symbiont. By using gentle filtration methods for raw seawater, a tiny eukaryote partner for UCYN-A of less than 3-µm in diameter was discovered. The bacterium sits on the cell wall of this calcifying picoeukaryote, donating fixed nitrogen and receiving fixed carbon in return."
https://openalex.org/W2048504217,"African Origins Humans originated in Africa and then spread across the globe. The high genetic diversity found in sub-Saharan Africa is consistent with this view, but the relationships among and within African populations have been less well explored. Schlebusch et al. (p. 374 , published online 20 September) genotyped 220 individuals from 11 populations representing groups from Southern Africa to determine their relationships and history. The data suggest that modern-day human populations arose from a complex blend of mixing between groups and genetic stratification."
https://openalex.org/W2032602280,"Despite intensive laboratory and clinical research over three decades, an effective treatment to delay the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease is not at hand. Recent clinical trial failures suggest that we must treat the disease earlier than in its mild to moderate stages, and major progress in validating presymptomatic biomarkers now makes secondary prevention trials possible. We will learn more about the natural history of the disease and any partial therapeutic responses from detailed analyses of recent trial results. This process will likely position the field for success, but only with much greater investment in all aspects of Alzheimer research and with careful design of future trials."
https://openalex.org/W2130444809,"LRRK2 is a kinase mutated in Parkinson's disease, but how the protein affects synaptic function remains enigmatic. We identified LRRK2 as a critical regulator of EndophilinA. Using genetic and biochemical studies involving Lrrk loss-of-function mutants and Parkinson-related LRRK2(G2019S) gain-of-kinase function, we show that LRRK2 affects synaptic endocytosis by phosphorylating EndoA at S75, a residue in the BAR domain. We show that LRRK2-mediated EndoA phosphorylation has profound effects on EndoA-dependent membrane tubulation and membrane association in vitro and in vivo and on synaptic vesicle endocytosis at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions in vivo. Our work uncovers a regulatory mechanism that indicates that reduced LRRK2 kinase activity facilitates EndoA membrane association, while increased kinase activity inhibits membrane association. Consequently, both too much and too little LRRK2-dependent EndoA phosphorylation impedes synaptic endocytosis, and we propose a model in which LRRK2 kinase activity is part of an EndoA phosphorylation cycle that facilitates efficient vesicle formation at synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1979679093,"Removing Fear Memories Disruption of reconsolidation of an activated fear memory prevents subsequent fear expression. After a memory reminder, extinction training can disrupt fear memory. In rodents, this process is dependent on a brain area called the amygdala. Agren et al. (p. 1550 ) used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a fear conditioning paradigm to show in humans that, after an associative fear memory was formed, reactivation and reconsolidation left a signature in the basolateral amygdala. This memory trace predicted later fear expression, which was linked to activity in areas forming the fear circuit of the brain. Extinction alone did not change this signal. However, extinction in the reconsolidation window blocked fear expression by erasing the fear memory trace in the amygdala and weakened the connection in the wider fear circuit of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2006532602,"Slip-Sliding Apart One versatile means of synthesizing nanometer-scale cylinders has been to start with ring-shaped molecules that stack on top of each other. Huang et al. (p. 1521 ; see the Perspective by Zhang and Aida ) took this approach a step further by giving the rings a flexible diameter. Specifically, rings were prepared consisting of six v-shaped building blocks with hydrophobic sides that could slide back and forth along one another and thereby expand or contract the pore at the center. The rings spontaneously stacked to form tubes in dilute aqueous solution, and heating induced contraction of the whole tube in a process that was readily reversible on cooling."
https://openalex.org/W2076653098,"The early Universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of the intergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars. However, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years (Myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond the sensitivity limits of current large telescopes. Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter than what otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. We report the discovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the cluster MACS1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnified object from the early universe. The object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in the two reddest bands of HST/WFC3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching the characteristics of z\sim9 objects. We derive a robust photometric redshift of z = 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15Myr (i.e., 3.6% of the age of the Universe). The large number of bands used to derive the redshift estimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such a distant object. The significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of \sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosity in its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass, star-formation rate and age. If the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift, then its age is less than 200 Myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying a formation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. The object is the first z>9 candidate that is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with JWST, demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highly magnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts."
https://openalex.org/W2133645220,"Autism has been described as a disorder of general neural processing, but the particular processing characteristics that might be abnormal in autism have mostly remained obscure. Here, we present evidence of one such characteristic: poor evoked response reliability. We compared cortical response amplitude and reliability (consistency across trials) in visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices of high-functioning individuals with autism and controls. Mean response amplitudes were statistically indistinguishable across groups, yet trial-by-trial response reliability was significantly weaker in autism, yielding smaller signal-to-noise ratios in all sensory systems. Response reliability differences were evident only in evoked cortical responses and not in ongoing resting-state activity. These findings reveal that abnormally unreliable cortical responses, even to elementary nonsocial sensory stimuli, may represent a fundamental physiological alteration of neural processing in autism. The results motivate a critical expansion of autism research to determine whether (and how) basic neural processing properties such as reliability, plasticity, and adaptation/habituation are altered in autism."
https://openalex.org/W1973294321,"Sleep is composed of an alternating sequence of REM and non-REM episodes, but their respective roles are not known. We found that the overall firing rates of hippocampal CA1 neurons decreased across sleep concurrent with an increase in the recruitment of neuronal spiking to brief ""ripple"" episodes, resulting in a net increase in neural synchrony. Unexpectedly, within non-REM episodes, overall firing rates gradually increased together with a decrease in the recruitment of spiking to ripples. The rate increase within non-REM episodes was counteracted by a larger and more rapid decrease of discharge frequency within the interleaved REM episodes. Both the decrease in firing rates and the increase in synchrony during the course of sleep were correlated with the power of theta activity during REM episodes. These findings assign a prominent role of REM sleep in sleep-related neuronal plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2046265580,"On top of the unfinished agenda of infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries, development, industrialization, urbanization, investment, and aging are drivers of an epidemic of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Malnutrition and infection in early life increase the risk of chronic NCDs in later life, and in adult life, combinations of major NCDs and infections, such as diabetes and tuberculosis, can interact adversely. Because intervention against either health problem will affect the other, intervening jointly against noncommunicable and infectious diseases, rather than competing for limited funds, is an important policy consideration requiring new thinking and approaches."
https://openalex.org/W1985950007,"The dentate gyrus is hypothesized to function as a ""gate,"" limiting the flow of excitation through the hippocampus. During epileptogenesis, adult-generated granule cells (DGCs) form aberrant neuronal connections with neighboring DGCs, disrupting the dentate gate. Hyperactivation of the mTOR signaling pathway is implicated in driving this aberrant circuit formation. While the presence of abnormal DGCs in epilepsy has been known for decades, direct evidence linking abnormal DGCs to seizures has been lacking. Here, we isolate the effects of abnormal DGCs using a transgenic mouse model to selectively delete PTEN from postnatally generated DGCs. PTEN deletion led to hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway, producing abnormal DGCs morphologically similar to those in epilepsy. Strikingly, animals in which PTEN was deleted from ≥ 9% of the DGC population developed spontaneous seizures in about 4 weeks, confirming that abnormal DGCs, which are present in both animals and humans with epilepsy, are capable of causing the disease."

https://openalex.org/W1982445469,"Vesta to the Core Vesta is one of the largest bodies in the main asteroid belt. Unlike most other asteroids, which are fragments of once larger bodies, Vesta is thought to have survived as a protoplanet since its formation at the beginning of the solar system (see the Perspective by Binzel , published online 20 September). Based on data obtained with the Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector aboard the Dawn spacecraft, Prettyman et al. (p. 242 , published online 20 September) show that Vesta's reputed volatile-poor regolith contains substantial amounts of hydrogen delivered by carbonaceous chondrite impactors. Observations of pitted terrain on Vesta obtained by Dawn's Framing Camera and analyzed by Denevi et al. (p. 246 , published online 20 September), provide evidence for degassing of volatiles and hence the presence of hydrated materials. Finally, paleomagnetic studies by Fu et al. (p. 238 ) on a meteorite originating from Vesta suggest that magnetic fields existed on the surface of the asteroid 3.7 billion years ago, supporting the past existence of a magnetic core dynamo."
https://openalex.org/W2319232757,"Keeping Track of Photon Phase In optical interferometers or optical communications, information is often stored in terms of the phase of the waveform or light pulse. However, fluctuations and noise can give rise to random jitter in the phase and amplitude of the optical pulses, making it difficult to keep track of the phase. Yonezawa et al. (p. 1514 ) developed a technique based on quantum mechanical squeezing to determine the phase of randomly varying optical waveforms. The quantum mechanical technique enhanced the precision with which the phase could be determined and, as optical technologies continue to be miniaturized, should be helpful in applications within metrology."

At some stage, as clusters grow larger, they effectively become tiny crystals of ice, but it has been hard to pinpoint precisely where in the range between 100 and 1000 molecules the formal transition takes place. Pradzynski et al. (p. 1529 ) used vibrational spectroscopy to show that the onset of an icelike structure, indicated by a characteristically distinct absorption band in the infrared, occurs at a cluster size of approximately 275 molecules."

An enigma is how microtubule binding and nucleotide hydrolysis are coordinated between sites separated by 25 nm. Redwine et al. (p. 1532 ) report an electron microscopy structure of the dynein microtubule-binding domain bound to microtubules in a high-affinity state and combined this with molecular dynamics and existing x-ray structures to provide a model for how dynein couples its affinity for microtubules with the nucleotide-bound state of the motor domain.
https://openalex.org/W1971075295,"Observing Sperm Factories The blood-testis barrier creates a permissive microenvironment for germ cell differentiation and protects meiotic germ cells from autoimmunity. To become sperm, large cysts of germline progenitors must cross the blood-testis barrier without causing damage. Smith and Braun (p. 798 , published online 20 September) show that somatic Sertoli cells, the gate-keepers of the blood-testis barrier, manage this task by building a network of compartments bounded by old and new tight junctions. Intercellular bridges, which connect germ cells within cysts, span the transient compartments by passing through vertical strands at tricellular junctions. Only after the formation of a new blood-testis barrier are old tight junctions removed and germ cells released."
https://openalex.org/W2022831509,"We have defined functions of MEK in regulating gliogenesis in developing cerebral cortex using loss- and gain-of-function mouse genetics. Radial progenitors deficient in both Mek1 and Mek2 fail to transition to the gliogenic mode in late embryogenesis, and astrocyte and oligodendroglial precursors fail to appear. In exploring mechanisms, we found that the key cytokine-regulated gliogenic pathway is attenuated. Further, the Ets transcription family member Etv5/Erm is strongly regulated by MEK and Erm overexpression can rescue the gliogenic potential of Mek-deleted progenitors. Remarkably, Mek1/2-deleted mice surviving postnatally exhibit cortices almost devoid of astrocytes and oligodendroglia and exhibit neurodegeneration. Conversely, expression of constitutively active MEK1 leads to a major increase in numbers of astrocytes in the adult brain. We conclude that MEK is essential for acquisition of gliogenic competence by radial progenitors and that levels of MEK activity regulate gliogenesis in the developing cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2047341512,"N on P Nitrogen atoms form strong, relatively unreactive triple bonds with themselves (in N 2 ) and with carbon (in cyanide and nitriles). In contrast, binding to transition metals often leaves an otherwise naked nitrogen center more prone to reactivity. Dielmann et al. (p. 1526 ) prepared a compound with nitrogen bound to divalent phosphorus, which acted more like a metal than a light element. Although the compound, formally a nitrene, was sufficiently stable to isolate at room temperature and characterize by x-ray diffraction, it transferred the nitrogen efficiently to unsaturated carbon compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1993468865,"Patterning by Subtraction Soft lithographic patterning is usually a “positive” inking process. A polymer stamp is cured on a hard master substrate and then inked with molecules such as alkane thiols, which can then be transferred to a second substrate (such as gold). However, the resolution of the transferred pattern is often degraded by surface diffusion. Liao et al. (p. 1517 ; see the Perspective by Rogers ) obtained higher resolution in a subtractive approach, in which oxygen-plasma–activated silicone stamps removed hydroxyl-terminated alkane thiols from gold surfaces. This lift-off process also removed the terminal gold atom bound to the alkane thiol. The bare regions could be backfilled with protein molecules, and multiple lift-off steps could create patterns with features as small as 40 nanometers."

By studying a large number of cat species and varieties, Kaelin et al. (p. 1536 ) identified two genes, Taqpep and Edn3 , as critical factors in the development of feline pigment patterns. Mutations in Taqpep are responsible for the blotched tabby pattern in domestic cats and the unusual coat of wild king cheetahs. Gene expression patterns in cat and cheetah skin suggest that Edn3 is a likely regulator of felid hair color. The findings support a common model for coat and pigment pattern formation in domestic and wild cats."
https://openalex.org/W2050948778,"The low-temperature states of bosonic fluids exhibit fundamental quantum effects at the macroscopic scale: the best-known examples are Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and superfluidity, which have been tested experimentally in a variety of different systems. When bosons are interacting, disorder can destroy condensation leading to a so-called Bose glass. This phase has been very elusive to experiments due to the absence of any broken symmetry and of a finite energy gap in the spectrum. Here we report the observation of a Bose glass of field-induced magnetic quasiparticles in a doped quantum magnet (Br-doped dichloro-tetrakis-thiourea-Nickel, DTN). The physics of DTN in a magnetic field is equivalent to that of a lattice gas of bosons in the grand-canonical ensemble; Br-doping introduces disorder in the hoppings and interaction strengths, leading to localization of the bosons into a Bose glass down to zero field, where it acquires the nature of an incompressible Mott glass. The transition from the Bose glass (corresponding to a gapless spin liquid) to the BEC (corresponding to a magnetically ordered phase) is marked by a novel, universal exponent governing the scaling on the critical temperature with the applied field, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study represents the first, quantitative account of the universal features of disordered bosons in the grand-canonical ensemble."
https://openalex.org/W2053463048,"Recent evidence suggests a major role of tumor-stromal interactions in pancreatic cancer pathobiology. The chemokine CXCL12 (stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)), abundantly produced by stromal cells, promotes progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells. On the other hand, pancreatic tumor cell-derived sonic hedgehog (SHH) acts predominantly on stromal cells to induce desmoplasia and, thus, has a paracrine effect on tumorigenesis and therapeutic outcome. In this study, we examined the association between these two proteins of pathological significance in pancreatic cancer. Our data demonstrate that CXCL12 leads to a dose- and time-dependent up-regulation of SHH in pancreatic cancer cells. CXCL12-induced SHH up-regulation is specifically mediated through the receptor CXCR4 and is dependent on the activation of downstream Akt and ERK signaling pathways. Both Akt and ERK cooperatively promote nuclear accumulation of NF-κB by inducing the phosphorylation and destabilization of its inhibitory protein, IκB-α. Using dominant negative IκB-α, a SHH promoter (deletion mutant) reporter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate that CXCL12 exposure enhances direct binding of NF-κB to the SHH promoter and that suppression of NF-κB activation abrogates CXCL12-induced SHH expression. Finally, our data demonstrate a strong correlative expression of CXCR4 and SHH in human pancreatic cancer tissues, whereas their expression is not observed in the normal pancreas. Altogether, our data reveal a novel mechanism underlying aberrant SHH expression in pancreatic cancer and identify a molecular link facilitating bidirectional tumor-stromal interactions.

Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis regulates SHH expression in pancreatic cancer cells. Our data show that CXCL12 specifically signals through CXCR4 to activate Akt and ERK, which then phosphorylate IκB-α. This phosphorylation directs IκB-α to degradation pathways, causing a release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which then directly binds to the SHH promoter. We also present data demonstrating a correlative expression of CXCR4 and SHH in pancreatic cancer clinical specimens, whereas their expression is not detected in normal pancreatic tissues. Thus, our findings suggest a novel molecular link between paracrine-acting chemokine and hedgehog pathways, and they are indicative of an active bidirectional tumor-stromal interaction. Antibodies against ERK1/2 (rabbit monoclonal), pERK1/2 (mouse monoclonal), IκB-α (mouse monoclonal), p-IκB-α (Ser-32/36) (rabbit polyclonal), and NF-κB/p65 (rabbit monoclonal) were procured from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against CXCR4 (rabbit polyclonal for immunoblot assay), CXCR4 (mouse monoclonal for surface CXCR4 neutralization), and SHH (rabbit monoclonal) were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) and Millipore (Temecula, CA), respectively. Antibodies against Akt (rabbit monoclonal), p-Akt (rabbit monoclonal), and CXCR7 (rabbit polyclonal) were from Epitomics (Burlingame, CA). β-Actin (mouse monoclonal) antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All non-target (ON-TARGET plus Non-targeting pool) and target-specific (ON-TARGET plus SMART pool) siRNAs and transfection reagent (DharmaFECT) were from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). SHH promoter reporter plasmids (pGL3-SHH) were described previously (18Caserta T.M. Kommagani R. Yuan Z. Robbins D.J. Mercer C.A. Kadakia M.P. p63 overexpression induces the expression of Sonic Hedgehog.Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The IκB-α dominant negative vector set (pCMV-IκB-α and pCMV-IκB-αM) was from Clontech Laboratories (Mountain View, CA), and pGL4.32[luc2P/NF-κB-RE/Hygro] and pRL-TK plasmids were from Promega (Madison, WI). pcDNA3.1 was from Invitrogen. HA protein kinase B (PKB) T308D S473D pcDNA3 from the Jim Woodgett Laboratory and pBabe-Puro-MEK-DD from the William Hahn Laboratory were procured through Addgene (Cambridge, MA) (plasmid numbers 14751 and 15268, respectively). Pancreatic cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa, HPAF, and ASPC1) were purchased from the ATCC, and the Colo357 cell line was provided by Dr. Subhash Chauhan (University of South Dakota/Sanford Health). All cell lines were maintained as monolayer cultures in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and 100 μm each of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell line validation was done by sequence tandem repeat (STR) genotyping and presence of defined markers (MUC1, MUC4, Vimentin, and DPC4). Cells were continuously monitored for their typical morphology and intermittently tested for mycoplasma using a MycoSensorPCR assay kit (Stratagene, catalog no. 302109) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Frozen pancreatic tissue samples (normal and malignant) were obtained through the Cooperative Human Tissue Network at the University of Alabama at Birmingham under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. Cells were cultured in complete medium in 6- or 12- well plates until they reached 50–60% confluence. Subsequently, cells were incubated in serum-free medium overnight, followed by treatments with different doses of CXCL12 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) under similar conditions for various time intervals (as indicated in the pertinent figure legends). To dissect the role of specific signaling pathways, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 20 μm LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) and 25 μm PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) (Cell Signaling Technology) alone or in combination. For neutralization of CXCL12 binding, cells were pretreated for 60 min with CXCR4-neutralizing antibody. For the knockdown of CXCR4 and CXCR7, cells were cultured in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with 50 nm of non-target or target-specific siRNAs using DharmaFECT according to the protocol of the manufacturer. To achieve constitutive activation of Akt and ERK, cells were transiently transfected with constitutively active mutant plasmids of Akt and MEK alone or in combination. Empty plasmids were used in control transfections. FuGENE (Roche) was used as the transfection reagent for plasmid transfection. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen), and subsequently cDNA was synthesized using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in 96-well plates using SYBR Green MasterMix (Applied Biosystems) on an iCycler system (Bio-Rad). The following PCR primer pairs were used: SHH, 5′-ACCGAGGGCTGGGACGAAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATTTGGCCGCCACCGAGTT-3′ (reverse) and GAPDH, 5′-gctgtgtggcaaagtccaa-g-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggtcaggctcctggaagata-3′ (reverse). The thermal conditions for real-time PCR assays were as follows: cycle 1, 95 °C for 10 min; cycle 2, (×40), 95 °C for 10 s and 58 °C for 45 s. Threshold cycle (CT) values for SHH were normalized against CT values for GAPDH, and a relative fold change in expression with respect to a reference sample was calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt method. Culture supernatants of CXCL12-treated pancreatic cancer cells were collected at different time intervals (24–72 h), centrifuged, and subjected to ELISA using an human SHH-specific ELISA kit (Abcam) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts was performed using the nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). In brief, cells were washed following treatment with 1 ml ice-cold PBS/phosphatase inhibitors (Roche), lysed in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. After collecting supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction), pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of complete lysis buffer and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (nuclear fraction) were stored at −80 °C. Immunoblotting was performed as described earlier (19Arora S. Bhardwaj A. Srivastava S.K. Singh S. McClellan S. Wang B. Singh A.P. Honokiol arrests cell cycle, induces apoptosis, and potentiates the cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine in human pancreatic cancer cells.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e21573Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In brief, total or fractionated protein lysates (20–60 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Blots were subjected to a standard immunodetection procedure using specific antibodies against various proteins and a SuperSignal West Femto Maximum sensitivity substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Logan, UT). The signal was detected using an LAS-3000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Cells were transiently cotransfected with 1 μg of pGL4.32 (luc2P/NF-κB-RE/Hygro) or pGL3-SHH along with 0.25 μg pRL-TK (a control reporter plasmid containing a Renilla reniformis luciferase gene downstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter). 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with CXCL12 for 24 h as described earlier and harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer instructions. The luciferase activity normalized as a ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase units. To further confirm the role of NF-κB in the CXCL12/CXCR4-induced SHH expression, we mutated the putative NF-κB binding region in the minimal CXCL12-responsive reporter construct (−102 to −1) using a Quikchange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The primer sequences used were as follows: forward, 5′-ctgggtggggagcggtgtg-tgacaccccgcagccgcggcgggcaagg-3′ and reverse, 5′-ccttgcccgccgcgg-ctgcggggtgtcacacaccgctccccacccag-3′. NF-κB transcriptional activity after CXCL12 treatment was measured using wild-type or mutant- reporter plasmids as described above. Pancreatic cancer cells (untreated or treated with CXCL12) were subjected to ChIP analyses using a ChIP-IT enzymatic kit (Active Motif). In brief, DNA-protein cross-linking was done with paraformaldehyde (37%) followed by enzymatic DNA shearing. Anti-NF-κB/p65 antibody was added to the sheared DNA-protein (chromatin) complexes. A normal rabbit IgG was added to serve as a background control antibody. Following immunoprecipitation, cross-linking was reversed, the proteins were digested by proteinase K, and the DNA was isolated for PCR analyses. The primer set used was as follows: SHH, 5′-ACCAAACTCCGATGTGTTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGCGCTCTCTCTTTTGCTTC-3′ (reverse). Input DNA (cross-linked chromatin without immunoprecipitation) and negative control antibody-precipitated DNA were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The effect of CXCL12 on SHH expression was studied in four pancreatic cancer cell lines (HPAF, Colo357, AsPC1, and MiaPaCa). We observed a dose-dependent up-regulation of SHH at both transcript and protein levels upon CXCL12 treatment of pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 1A). A 2.0- to 3.0-fold induction of SHH was detected with the lowest dose of 25 ng/ml, which increased further (over 10-fold) with higher doses of CXCL12. In a time course assay, we observed an induction of SHH as early as 4 h after treatment at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1B). The SHH expression increased with exposure time, and maximum up-regulation of SHH was observed after 24 h of exposure to CXCL12, which decreased thereafter. As SHH is a secreted protein, we also measured its levels in culture media of CXCL12-treated pancreatic cancer cells. Our data demonstrate a significant accumulation of secreted SHH in the media over the 1- to 3-day period (supplemental Fig. 1). Together, these data demonstrate that CXCL12 up-regulates the expression of SHH in a dose- and time-dependent manner in pancreatic cancer cells. CXCL12 can produce its stimulatory effects by binding to its two receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7 (10Sun X. Cheng G. Hao M. Zheng J. Zhou X. Zhang J. Taichman R.S. Pienta K.J. Wang J.

CXCL12 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 pathway in cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2010; 16: 2927-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the expression of both these receptors in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Expression of both CXCR4 and CXCR7 was observed in all four pancreatic cancer cell lines (data not shown). Subsequently, we examined which of these two chemokine receptors mediate SHH induction upon CXCL12 treatment. For this, we silenced the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 through RNA interference in two pancreatic cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa and Colo357) prior to treatment with CXCL12. CXCR4- and CXCR7-targeted siRNAs led to specific and effective silencing of gene expression (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we observed that CXCL12-induced SHH expression was abrogated only in cells transfected with CXCR4-targeted siRNAs, whereas CXCR7 silencing did not have any suppressive effect on SHH induction (Fig. 2). Interestingly, we also observed an increased expression of CXCR4 in CXCL12-treated pancreatic cells, indicating a positive feedback regulation. A similar observation has been made earlier in glioma cells (20do Carmo A. Patricio I. Cruz M.T. Carvalheiro H. Oliveira C.R. Lopes M.C. CXCL12/CXCR4 promotes motility and proliferation of glioma cells.Cancer Biol. Ther. 2010; 9: 56-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further ascertain the role of CXCR4 in mediating CXCL12-induced SHH up-regulation, we treated the cells with CXCR4-neutralizing antibody prior to the induction with CXCL12. We observed that pretreatment of pancreatic cancer cells with CXCR4-neutralizing antibody abolished CXCL12-induced SHH up-regulation (supplemental Fig. 2). Together, these data demonstrate that CXCR4, not CXCR7, mediates CXCL12-induced up-regulation of SHH in pancreatic cancer cells. We next set out to examine the effector signaling pathways involved in CXCL12-induced SHH expression. CXCL12 induces receptor phosphorylation, which leads to conformational changes and subsequent activation of a heterotrimeric G protein complex bound to the receptor intracellular domain, thus initiating downstream signaling (11Teicher B.A. Fricker S.P. CXCL12 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 pathway in cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2010; 16: 2927-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). We and others have reported earlier that treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with CXCL12 elicits the activation of Akt and ERK (17Singh S. Srivastava S.K. Bhardwaj A. Owen L.B. Singh A.P. CXCL12-CXCR4 signalling axis confers gemcitabine resistance to pancreatic cancer cells. A novel target for therapy.Br. J.

Chemokine receptor CXCR4 enhances proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells through AKT- and ERK-dependent pathways.Pancreas. 2010; 39: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt and ERK by CXCL12 occurs as early as 1 min and starts diminishing by 30 min post-treatment (supplemental Fig. 3A). Therefore, to examine the role of these signaling nodes in CXCL12-induced expression of SHH, we treated the pancreatic cancer cells with specific pharmacological inhibitors of Akt (LY294002) and ERK (PD98059) prior to stimulation with CXCL12. Immunoblot analyses of the extracted proteins demonstrated an effective and specific inhibition of CXCL12-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK by their respective pharmacological inhibitors (Fig. 3, upper panel). Furthermore, we observed that inhibition of either Akt or ERK led to abrogation of CXCL12-induced SHH expression, whereas their combined inhibition led to a more potent suppression (Fig. 3, lower panel). Together, these findings indicate that both the Akt and ERK pathways cooperatively mediate CXCL12-induced SHH up-regulation. To further explore downstream of Akt and ERK, we focused on NF-κB, which has been shown earlier to be activated by CXCL12 (17Singh S. Srivastava S.K. Bhardwaj A. Owen L.B. Singh A.P. CXCL12-CXCR4 signalling axis confers gemcitabine resistance to pancreatic cancer cells. A novel target for therapy.Br. J. Cancer. 2010; 103: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and to be implicated in transcriptional regulation of SHH (23Kasperczyk H. Baumann B. Debatin K.M. Fulda S. Characterization of Sonic Hedgehog as a novel NF-κB target gene that promotes NF-κB-mediated apoptosis resistance and tumor growth in vivo.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We observed a time-dependent enhanced nuclear accumulation of NF-κB in pancreatic cancer cells upon CXCL12 treatment that correlated with a concomitant decrease in its cytoplasmic levels (supplemental Fig. 3B). Similarly, we also observed an increased transcriptional activity of the NF-κB-responsive promoter in CXCL12-treated pancreatic cancer cells (data not shown). When we treated pancreatic cancer cells (MiaPaCa and Colo357) with Akt and ERK inhibitors, alone or in combination, prior to exposing them to CXCL12, a decreased nuclear accumulation of NF-κB was observed (Fig. 4A). These data were corroborated with increased cytoplasmic levels of NF-κB in Akt- and/or ERK inhibitor-treated pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 4A). To further substantiate the role of Akt and ERK in NF-κB translocation, we transfected the pancreatic cancer cells with active mutants of Akt and MEK (an upstream kinase of ERK). We observed an enhanced nuclear localization of NF-κB in activated Akt- and/or MEK-expressing cells that was also correlated with increased SHH expression (supplemental Fig. 4). To examine what causes the reduction in NF-κB nuclear accumulation upon activation of Akt and/or ERK, we analyzed the cytoplasmic extracts of treated pancreatic cancer cells for determination of IκB-α levels. IκB is a biological inhibitor of NF-κB that keeps it sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive complex (24Perkins N.D. The diverse and complex roles of NF-κB subunits in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). We observed that CXCL12 treatment led to a drastic decrease in IκB-α level, which was associated with a concomitant increase in its phosphorylation, thus indicating the destabilization of IκB-α after exposure to CXCL12. This effect was abrogated in cells that were pretreated with Akt and/or ERK inhibitors prior to stimulation with CXCL12 (Fig. 4A). To further investigate the functional consequence of this observation, we examined whether inhibition of Akt and/or ERK also suppressed CXCL12-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity. For this, we examined the CXCL12-induced transcriptional activation of NF-κB-responsive promoter in Akt and ERK-inhibited pancreatic cancer cells. We observed that inhibition of Akt and/or ERK overrode the CXCL12-induced increase in the transcriptional activity of the NF-κB-responsive promoter (Fig. 4B). Together, these data confirm a role for both Akt and ERK pathways in CXCL12-induced NF-κB activation. Having observed CXCL12-induced Akt-/ERK-mediated activation of NF-κB, we next evaluated the role of NF-κB in SHH up-regulation. For this, we utilized a degradation-resistant IκB-α mutant that carries serine-to-alanine mutations at the 32 and 36 positions and thus cannot be phosphorylated in response to upstream kinase stimuli. Pancreatic cancer cells were transfected with either WT or mutant (MUT) IκB-α, and the effect on cellular distribution of NF-κB in response to CXCL12 treatment was examined. Although CXCL12 induced considerable phosphorylation and degradation of IkB-α in IκB-α-WT transfected cells, IκB-α-MUT-transfected cells exhibited limited phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α (Fig. 5A). As a consequence, NF-κB remained sequestered in the cytoplasm in IκB-α-MUT-transfected cells, whereas substantial nuclear localization of NF-κB was observed in IκB-α-WT-transfected and CXCL12-treated pancreatic cancer cells. When we examined the effect of NF-κB activation blockade on CXCL12 induced up-regulation of SHH, we observed that it was significantly inhibited in pancreatic cancer cells transfected with IκB-α-MUT (Fig. 5B). To further confirm the role of NF-κB in transcriptional up-regulation of SHH by CXCL12, we utilized SHH promoter (deletion mutant)-reporter plasmids car"

Unlike most other asteroids, which are fragments of once larger bodies, Vesta is thought to have survived as a protoplanet since its formation at the beginning of the solar system (see the Perspective by Binzel , published online 20 September). Based on data obtained with the Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector aboard the Dawn spacecraft, Prettyman et al. (p. 242 , published online 20 September) show that Vesta's reputed volatile-poor regolith contains substantial amounts of hydrogen delivered by carbonaceous chondrite impactors. Observations of pitted terrain on Vesta obtained by Dawn's Framing Camera and analyzed by Denevi et al. (p. 246 , published online 20 September), provide evidence for degassing of volatiles and hence the presence of hydrated materials. Finally, paleomagnetic studies by Fu et al. (p. 238 ) on a meteorite originating from Vesta suggest that magnetic fields existed on the surface of the asteroid 3.7 billion years ago, supporting the past existence of a magnetic core dynamo."

This study describes the association between maternal ALA availability during gestation and lactation, and alterations in the Fads2 DNA methylation in both maternal and offspring livers, at the end of lactation period. Both Fads2 promoter and intron 1 DNA methylation were increased in the groups receiving postnatal flaxseed oil containing 50% ALA (mothers or pups), while bivariate analysis indicated a significant association of the Fads2 epigenetic status in the liver between each mother and its offspring. In addition, Fads2 expression was negatively correlated with promoter methylation at the individual level in maternal livers (P<0.05). This study also indicated that the interplay between ALA availability during gestation and lactation can differentially alter the expression of desaturases and elongases involved in ω-6 and ω-3 metabolic pathways. In summary, when considering the perinatal dietary ALA requirements in mice, both gestation and lactation periods should be considered as having distinct roles in modulating the metabolism of ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acids in maternal mouse livers.—Niculescu, M.

We report that in the developing spinal cord, a focal source of gdnf is present in the floor plate (FP) where commissural axons cross the midline. Gdnf has no direct guidance properties but switches on the responsiveness of crossing commissural growth cones to the midline repellent Semaphorin3B by suppressing calpain-mediated processing of the Sema3B signaling coreceptor Plexin-A1. Analysis of single and double mutant mouse models indicates that although gdnf is the principal trigger of Sema3B midline repulsion, it acts with another FP cue, NrCAM. Finally, genetic and in vitro experiments provide evidence that this gdnf effect is RET independent and mediated by NCAM/GFRα1 signaling. This study identifies a regulator of midline crossing and reveals interplays between Semaphorin and gdnf signaling during axon guidance."

Here, we have examined the contribution of the essential ribosomal protein L40 in these processes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of either the RPL40A or RPL40B gene and in vivo depletion of L40 impair 60 S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. Polysome profile analyses reveal the accumulation of half-mers and a moderate reduction in free 60 S ribosomal subunits. Pulse-chase, Northern blotting, and primer extension analyses in the L40-depleted strain clearly indicate that L40 is not strictly required for the precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) processing reactions but contributes to optimal 27 SB pre-rRNA maturation. Moreover, depletion of L40 hinders the nucleo-cytoplasmic export of pre-60 S ribosomal particles. Importantly, all these defects most likely appear as the direct consequence of impaired Nmd3 and Rlp24 release from cytoplasmic pre-60 S ribosomal subunits and their inefficient recycling back into the nucle(ol)us. In agreement, we show that hemagglutinin epitope-tagged L40A assembles in the cytoplasm into almost mature pre-60 S ribosomal particles. Finally, we have identified that the hemagglutinin epitope-tagged L40A confers resistance to sordarin, a translation inhibitor that impairs the function of eukaryotic elongation factor 2, whereas the rpl40a and rpl40b null mutants are hypersensitive to this antibiotic.

Nonetheless, breast-feeding and complementary feeding practices differ greatly from global recommendations. Although the World Health Organization recommends that infants receive solely breast milk for the first 6 months of life, only about one-third of infants in low-income countries meet this goal, just one-third of children 6 to 24 months old in low-income countries meet the minimum criteria for dietary diversity, and only one in five who are breast-fed receive a minimum acceptable diet.

https://openalex.org/W2017564931,"The KDR gene, which participates in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, produces two functionally distinct protein products, membrane-bound KDR (mbKDR) and its isoform, soluble KDR (sKDR). Since sKDR does not have a tyrosine kinase domain and does not dimerize, it is principally an antagonist of lymphangiogenesis by sequestering VEGF-C. Alternative polyadenylation of exon 30 or intron 13 leads to the production of mbKDR or sKDR, respectively, yet the regulatory mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that an antisense morpholino oligomer directed against the exon 13-intron 13 junction increases sKDR (suppressing lymphangiogenesis) and decreases mbKDR (inhibiting hemangiogenesis). The latent polyadenylation site in intron 13 of KDR is activated by blocking the upstream 5′ splicing site with an antisense morpholino oligomer. Intravitreal morpholino injection suppressed laser choroidal neovascularization while increasing sKDR. In the mouse cornea, subconjunctival injection of the morpholino-inhibited corneal angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, and suppressed graft rejection after transplantation.

https://openalex.org/W2042720942,"Disruption of mammary stromal-epithelial communication leads to aberrant mammary gland development and induces mammary tumorigenesis. Macrophages have been implicated in carcinogenesis primarily by creating an inflammatory microenvironment, which promotes growth of the adjacent epithelial cells. Adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1 (AEBP1), a novel proinflammatory mediator, promotes macrophage inflammatory responsiveness by inducing NF-κB activity, which has been implicated in tumor cell growth and survival by aberrant sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression. Here, we show that stromal macrophage AEBP1 overexpression results in precocious alveologenesis in the virgin AEBP1 transgenic (AEBP1(TG)) mice, and the onset of ductal hyperplasia was accelerated in AEBP1(TG) mice fed a high fat diet, which induces endogenous AEBP1 expression. Transplantation of AEBP1(TG) bone marrow cells into non-transgenic (AEBP1(NT)) mice resulted in alveolar hyperplasia with up-regulation of NF-κB activity and TNFα expression as displayed in the AEBP1(TG) mammary macrophages and epithelium. Shh expression was induced in AEBP1(TG) macrophages and RAW264.7 macrophages overexpressing AEBP1. The Shh target genes Gli1 and Bmi1 expression was induced in the AEBP1(TG) mammary epithelium and HC11 mammary epithelial cells co-cultured with AEBP1(TG) peritoneal macrophages. The conditioned AEBP1(TG) macrophage culture media promoted NF-κB activity and survival signal, Akt activation, in HC11 cells, whereas such effects were abolished by TNFα neutralizing antibody treatment. Furthermore, HC11 cells displayed enhanced proliferation in response to AEBP1(TG) macrophages and their conditioned media. Our findings highlight the role of AEBP1 in the signaling pathways regulating the cross-talk between mammary epithelium and stroma that could predispose the mammary tissue to tumorigenesis."

Some neuroscientists fear that implementing the 3Rs will prohibit essential studies. Others view them as fundamental ethical principles that improve the quality of research. A regulatory system that integrates science and welfare is most likely to deliver public confidence. The 3Rs—replacement, reduction, and refinement—are aimed at minimizing the welfare costs to animals used in research. Some neuroscientists fear that implementing the 3Rs will prohibit essential studies. Others view them as fundamental ethical principles that improve the quality of research. A regulatory system that integrates science and welfare is most likely to deliver public confidence. Scientists around the world are wondering how changes in regulations governing animal research will influence progress in neuroscience. How, for example, would active promotion of the 3Rs, as required in the new European Directive (European Commission, 2010European CommissionOfficial Journal of the European Union. 2010; L 276: 33-79Google Scholar) and the most recent edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals—“the Guide”—(National Research Council, 2011National Research CouncilGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 8th Edition. National Academies Press, Washington, DC2011Google Scholar) impact innovative research in neuroscience if applied globally? The principles of the 3Rs—replacement, reduction, and refinement—were first articulated over 50 years ago by W.M.S. Russell and R.L. Burch (Russell and Burch, 1959Russell W.M.S. Burch R.L. The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique. 2nd Edition, 1992 UFAW. Methuen, London1959Google Scholar). Replacement refers to methods that avoid the use of animals either absolutely (e.g., using computer modeling or human volunteers) or relatively (e.g., using invertebrates such as Drosophila and nematodes, or cultured cell lines derived from animals). Reduction occurs when researchers obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, often through improved experimental design and technique or statistical analysis. Where the use of animals is unavoidable, refinement refers to improvements to scientific procedures and husbandry that minimize pain or distress and improve welfare. These principles have long been recognized by Ethical Review Committees and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees as pivotal to their consideration of research protocols. As stated above, they are highlighted in the Guide as well as the EU Directive, both of which act as key references for animal care and use worldwide. But the manner and extent of implementation of the 3Rs in animal-based research generally, and neuroscience in particular, vary considerably, and not all neuroscience investigators regard the 3Rs as either helpful or binding, much less as appropriate standards to be applied internationally. Since the ever-increasing globalization of scientific inquiry is leading to both greater collaboration and greater competition among scientists world-wide, a clear, consistent and balanced approach to the use of animals in research is becoming more necessary. Variation in practice in the use of animals makes collaboration, the pooling of data and copublication of results more difficult. And it would surely be unacceptable if cutting ethical corners in the use of animals could give scientists an edge in competition with rival groups. Harmonization is called for, but the debate is whether this requires internationally mandated research standards and policies in relation to principles such as the 3Rs. Put simply, is there a need for neuroscientists internationally to promote implementation of the 3Rs? And would this limit or enhance the quality of their science? Some neuroscientists urge caution in considering harmonization of any standards applied to the use of animals in science. They argue that shared principles already exist across the scientific community and that, while there is value in identifying areas of agreement, a divergence of practice within a strong overall ethical framework is desirable. Proper evaluation and reporting on the outcome of such diverse practices could be the optimal route to best practice. While the goal of the 3Rs serves as a worthy guideline for all neuroscientists, some researchers caution against embedding the 3Rs as a core value, perceiving a risk of raising false and unrealizable expectations or possibly jeopardizing important medical progress. On the other hand, some neuroscientists take the view that a key consideration for the animals used in their research is to minimize pain and distress and to improve well-being in accordance with their science. The 3Rs are seen by them as a powerful mnemonic for ethically appropriate behavior. This broad spectrum of views within the neuroscience community reflects the range of interpretations held by the authors of this opinion piece. However, we have become convinced of the value of sharing these views in a transparent manner and, through dialog, moving toward common ground. It is surely indisputable for any reasonable person that every effort should be made to adopt alternatives to animal experimentation, especially where those alternatives are of proven validity. But it would be wrong to raise expectations that widespread “replacement” of animal models, especially in neuroscience, is feasible in the foreseeable future. Given our current state of knowledge, it is difficult in the short term to imagine effective research on such topics as the detailed organization of neuronal circuitry, the mechanisms of perception, decision making, learning, memory and attention, the development of the nervous system, the molecular and cellular basis of disease processes, and the repair of damage in the nervous system, without the direct use of animals or preparations derived from animals. Even the more modest goal of “reduction” in the numbers of animals used in research has to be expressed in a way that does not risk stifling crucial research. For example, the development of ever more sophisticated techniques for modifying genetic function has enabled the creation of much more valuable animal models for the exploration of both normal function (e.g., memory formation) and disease (e.g., neurodegenerative disease). But their very value means these models are likely be used in greater numbers. It is notable that the general increase in numbers of laboratory animals used in the UK over the last 15 years is largely accounted for by increased breeding and use of genetically modified animals—mainly mice and fish. Use of unmodified (wild-type) animals has remained relatively stable in spite of significantly increased public and private investment in biomedical research over this period, which might have been expected to elevate the numbers proportionately. It is clear that “refinement” deserves much more emphasis. Improvements in husbandry, veterinary care, environmental enrichment, and experimental techniques in neuroscience research have the potential to reduce the ethical cost of research significantly, in terms of suffering, and at the same time improve the quality of the science (e.g., Prescott et al., 2010Prescott M.J. Brown V.J. Flecknell P.A. Gaffan D. Garrod K. Lemon R.N. Parker A.J. Ryder K. Schultz W. Scott L. et al.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2010; 193: 167-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). There can be little doubt that healthy, contented, unstressed animals make better, more reliable models for scientific research. Worldwide changes in the regulatory environment are ongoing and they are certain to have an impact on neuroscience research and related animal care programs. It was in this context that the Institute of Medicine’s Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders held a workshop at The Royal Society’s Chicheley Hall in the UK in July 2011 entitled “International Animal Research Regulations: Impact on Neuroscience Research.” Cochaired by Colin Blakemore of the University of Oxford and Arthur Sussman of the MacArthur Foundation, this two-day workshop convened a group of experts and stakeholders—from academia and industry, to law and journalism, from the United States and Europe, to South America and Asia—to exchange ideas and confront the evolving standards and policies head-on and candidly. The discussants considered not only the various regulatory systems that govern animal care and use, but also the emergence of private party actions to intervene in the enforcement of regulations and the increasing use of freedom of information approaches, such as federal and state “sunshine” legislation in the United States, to seek information about animal care and use (Institute of Medicine, 2012Institute of MedicineInternational Research Regulations: Impact on Neuroscience Research – Workshop Summary. National Academies Press, Washington, DC2012Google Scholar). While not representing a total consensus of all the workshop’s participants, some important messages emerged during the presentations and subsequent discussions. Key among these was the need for a strong regulatory and institutional compliance framework to ensure that the use of animals in research is ethically secure and legally sound and to provide confidence in public communication about, and defense of, the research. At the same time, delegates were concerned to avoid placing unnecessary constraints on important neuroscience research. The scientific study of living organisms is critical if we are to understand both life on earth and the diseases and disorders that we cannot yet treat or prevent. Since all living organisms have a common origin and all vertebrates share a large fraction of their genes and a wide range of cellular mechanisms, we have already learned a great deal about the principles of human biology and behavior from animal models and can hope to learn more. Moreover, advances in veterinary care also depend crucially on understanding gained from the study of animals. A common feature of animal research legislation around the world is that animals may be used for some experimental procedures that would not be acceptable in humans. These include manipulation of the environment, the genetics, or the bodies of the animals. Nevertheless, it must be appreciated that the use of animals in neuroscience research raises particularly sharp ethical issues. The fact that many harrowing disorders of the nervous system, such as dementias, Parkinson’s disease, and motor neuron disorders, are increasing in prevalence and are not adequately treatable heightens the potential benefits of such research. But for the same reasons, neuroscience research often involves the creation of such distressing conditions in animals, or the manipulation of their experience, in ways that highlight the potential ethical costs of animal research. As neuroscience research moves forward, there is likely to be a continuing reliance on animal models. This likelihood must not be concealed in discussions with politicians, the media, the public, or with groups that oppose animal use. But this should not preclude grasping opportunities to implement the 3Rs: indeed any continuing need to use animals simply raises the moral imperative to optimize welfare and to search for every way to reduce suffering. Indeed, in the next few years mathematical and computational modeling of the function of neurons and neural circuits will become more effective; use of “lower” species such as zebrafish, strengthened by evidence of conservation of genetic mechanisms, is likely to become even more powerful; and advanced imaging techniques will help to reduce numbers of animals used and to refine the nature of studies. Many researchers (and ethicists) consider that the application of core guiding principles for animal care and use is preferable to the application of slavish general rules. Such principles include the following:(1)defining the needs and promises of neuroscience research—asking critically whether animals are the optimal and justifiable model and what discoveries are likely to result from their use in the laboratory;(2)making the care and welfare of all research animals a high priority—scientists must be certain that the animals they use are treated humanely, above all for ethical reasons, but also to optimize the health and behavioral status of the animals and hence the validity and consistency of research results;(3)striving to “replace, reduce, and refine” animal use wherever possible; and(4)securing public confidence that oversight of research is sufficiently rigorous but mindful of, and informed about, the linkage between use of animal models and medical progress. Through rigorously applying these core principles, scientists, regulators, and other stakeholders can best collaborate to develop transparent and workable criteria that reflect the interests of the public and patients in both animal welfare and scientific progress. Many advocate an approach that takes into consideration both the welfare of the animals and the quality and potential benefits of the research in a “cost-benefit analysis” (Animal Procedures Committee, 2003Animal Procedures Committee (2003). Review of cost-benefit assessment in the use of animals in research. (London: Home Office). http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/apc/cost-benefit-assessment?view=Binary.Google Scholar). At the same, time they urge that while the regulatory framework should ensure compliance by investigators and institutions, it should also avoid imposing undue bureaucratic burdens. The problem of improving our understanding of living systems and their disorders remains, and the ethical care and use of research animals are critical to that understanding. We must consider our commitment to animal welfare in the context of important scientific goals together with both the needs and concerns of society (Figure 1). The magnitude of the challenges of neuroscience research, and especially the growing and costly toll of diseases of the nervous system around the world, must be prominent in the minds of all who have an interest in the conduct of medical research. Given the complexity of some of these arguments and the apparently seductive appeal of efforts to curtail the use of animals in science, it becomes both a necessity and a duty for neuroscientists to listen to public concerns and to reach out to inform and engage the public, including those with a professed concern for animal welfare, about why this research is important. Neuroscientists need to become skilled at explaining, in lay terms, how the animal models that they select are the least distressing and the most likely to promote scientific advances that will benefit all living beings. The objective should be to achieve maximum benefit from the minimum number of animals while causing the least pain or distress. Consideration and implementation of the 3Rs must therefore be thoroughly integrated into the procedures for the approval of all animal research protocols. Importantly, Russell and Burch viewed the implementation of the 3Rs as a means of improving the quality of science, not merely as a measure toward improving welfare. The 3Rs should be used to effectively reduce the potential harms of proposed research so that science with potentially significant benefits can be properly justified in the public eye. It is clear that neuroscientists must recognize the importance, both symbolic and real, of “replacement, reduction, and refinement” whenever animals are used. However, they may be most persuaded of this through realizing that rational implementation of the 3Rs will improve their science and help enable them to strive for “relevance, robustness, and reliability” in their investigations. The IOM Forum was a useful step in the honest and nuanced dialog that must continue as scientists, lawmakers, regulators, welfare organizations, and the public define the path forward for realizing the huge potential of neuroscience while supporting the proliferation of sensible, ethical, and balanced legal and regulatory systems."

Here we identify 44 microRNAs that are expressed in the primitive streak region of gastrula stage chicken embryos. We show that the primary effect of FGF signaling on microRNA abundance is to negatively regulate the levels of miR-let-7b, -9, -19b, -107, -130b, and -218. LIN28B inhibits microRNA processing and is positively regulated by FGF signaling. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments show that LIN28B negatively regulates the expression of miR-19b, -130b, and let-7b, whereas negative modulation of miR-9, -107, and -218 appears to be independent of LIN28B function.

The body plan of vertebrates arises during gastrulation, when through complex morphogenetic movements, the three primary germ layers and the major body axes are formed. A key feature of gastrulation in amniotes is the ingression of cells from the epithelial epiblast through the primitive streak to form the mesoderm and the endoderm cell layers (1Stern C.D. Gastrulation: From Cells to Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004: 219-232Google Scholar).

Transcriptional profiling has shown that gastrulation and germ layer formation involve the up-regulation and down-regulation of several thousand genes (3Alev C. Wu Y. Kasukawa T. Jakt L.M. Ueda H.R.

Genes up-regulated in the primitive streak region of avian embryos include members of the FGF, NOTCH, PDGF, EPH, and canonical and noncanonical WNT pathways, negative pathway modulators, and a large number of transcription factors. The FGF, PDGF, and WNT pathways have been shown to regulate primitive streak formation and/or cell migration through the streak (5Chuai M. Weijer C.J.

FGF signaling is required for expression of members from all of these pathways, suggesting that it lies at the top of a hierarchy of signaling cascades. MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate crucial although still relatively undefined processes during early embryogenesis. Their importance is underscored by the early and severe phenotypes observed when miR processing is inactivated. In sea urchin, loss of Drosha or Dicer blocks gastrulation and greatly reduces expression of endoderm- and mesoderm-specific genes (9Song J.L. Stoeckius M. Maaskola J. Friedländer M. Stepicheva N. Juliano C. Lebedeva S. Thompson W. Rajewsky N. Wessel G.M. Select microRNAs are essential for early development in the sea urchin.Dev. Biol. 2012; 362: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These defects were rescued by the introduction of four miRs. Dicer and DGRC8 null mouse embryos are reduced in size, fail to gastrulate or express mesoderm markers, and exhibit a defect in development of ES cells that form the inner mass (10Bernstein E. Kim S.Y. Carmell M.A. Murchison E.P. Alcorn H. Li M.Z. Mills A.A. Elledge S.J. Anderson K.V. Hannon G.J. Dicer is essential for mouse development.Nat.

DGCR8 is essential for microRNA biogenesis and silencing of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Ablation of Dicer in zebrafish leads to cell movement defects during gastrulation and abnormal heart and neural development (12Giraldez A.J. Cinalli R.M. Glasner M.E. Enright A.J. Thomson J.M.

MicroRNAs regulate brain morphogenesis in zebrafish.Science. 2005; 308: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). miRs play an important role in regulating pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (13Melton C. Judson R.L. Blelloch R. Opposing microRNA families regulate self-renewal in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2010; 463: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar); however, this function alone is unlikely to account for the embryonic phenotypes observed when dicer or DGRC8 are ablated. Individual miRs have been shown to regulate specific aspects of EMT in cultured cells (14Gregory P.A. Bracken C.P. Bert A.G. Goodall G.J.

LIN28B and its paralog LIN28A negatively regulate miR processing, in particular the let-7 family of miRs (19Viswanathan S.R. Daley G.Q.

Almost all of these findings have arisen from tissue culture studies of stem cells or immortalized cell lines. Little information is available about the functions of LIN28 and its relationship to miR processing during early embryogenesis. Here we investigate the relationship between FGF signaling, LIN28B expression, and miR function during avian gastrulation. Fertile chicken (Gallus gallus) eggs from Hy-Line International (Spencer, IA) were incubated at 37 °C with high humidity until the embryos reached Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stage 4 (24Hamburger V.

Embryos were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. Embryos analyzed by in situ hybridization (ISH) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, whereas those used for real-time PCR analysis were dissected into lysis buffer (Life Technologies). RNA was isolated from embryos using the mirVana miR isolation kit (Ambion). First-strand cDNA was prepared using the NCode miR first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). To generate cDNA suitable for measuring miR precursors, a custom primer corresponding to the 3′ end of the pre-miR sequence was used in the reverse transcriptase reaction in lieu of random hexamers. Real-time PCR analyses were carried out with Maxima SYBR Green quantitative PCR master mix (Fermentas/Thermo Scientific) in a Rotorgene RG6000, using standard protocols and the Rotorgene statistical analysis software. Mature miRs were amplified using primers corresponding to the exact sequence of the miRs, along with the “Universal” primer supplied with the NCode kit (Invitrogen). miR precursors were amplified using primers corresponding to their stem-loop structures, whereas primary miR transcripts were amplified using the 3′ primer of the stem-loop structure and a 5′ primer positioned ∼100 bases upstream of the stem-loop structure (27Schmittgen T.D. Jiang J. Liu Q. Yang L. A high-throughput method to monitor the expression of microRNA precursors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). All real-time PCR assays were performed in triplicate and included a no-template control. To normalize the data, each real-time experiment also included measurement of a control gene: ribosomal protein RPL4 for measuring primary miR transcripts and mRNAs, snRNA U6 for mature miRs and pre-miRs, or β-galactosidase (β-gal) for cDNA prepared from transfected HeLa cells. Samples of RNA isolated from the primitive streak region of HH stage 4 chicken embryos were mixed with spike-in controls and fluorescently labeled with Hy3 and Hy5 dyes using the miRCURY LNA microRNA power labeling kit (Exiqon, Woburn, MA). Samples were hybridized according to the protocols of the miRCURY microRNA array kit, using multispecies array based on miRBase version 11. Hybridized slides were processed and scanned according to standard protocols. Each slide contained four array replicates, which were compared against negative probe controls using an unpaired Student's t test and adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using custom-built software written in the R statistical computing language. Control or experimentally manipulated embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. ISH were performed as described (28Nieto M.A. Patel K. Wilkinson D.G. In situ hybridization analysis of chick embryos in whole mount and tissue sections.Methods Cell Biol. 1996; 51: 219-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications (29Antin P.B. Geisha: Gallus Expression in Situ Hybridization Analysis. 2012; geisha.arizona.edu/geisha/protocols.jspGoogle Scholar). Detection of miR transcripts was accomplished using LNA probes (Exiqon) labeled with digoxigenin at the 5′ and 3′ ends. ISH using LNA probes was performed as described (30Darnell D.K. Kaur S. Stanislaw S. Konieczka J.H. Yatskievych T.A. Antin P.B. MicroRNA expression during chick embryo development.Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 3156-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown and passaged in DMEM (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum, supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. Luciferase reporter constructs were generated from the vector pmiR-Report (Ambion). Constructs contained either the full-length 3′-UTR from the candidate target mRNA or a 50–60-bp miR recognition element (MRE). 12-well culture plates of HeLa cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 500 μl of antibiotic-free medium and then transfected using standard protocols with 1 μg of luciferase construct and 0.5 μg of a β-gal expression vector per well, using either Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or TransPass transfection reagent (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection into Tropix lysis buffer (Applied Biosystems). Luciferase and β-gal activities were measured using the Dual-Light reporter gene assay system (Applied Biosystems). All luciferase assays were run in triplicate, normalized relative to β-gal, and compared with transfections using the parental vector (unmodified pmiR-Report). For experiments using miR mimics (Dharmacon), 100 nm of either a G. gallus miR mimic or a Caenorhabditis elegans miR-167 control mimic were used. The target protector miR-130b morpholino (GeneTools) was transfected at 5 μm. Cells were harvested 30 h after transfection, according to Yekta et al. (31Yekta S. Shih I.H. Bartel D.P. MicroRNA-directed cleavage of HOXB8 mRNA.Science. 2004; 304: 594-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Lists of evolutionarily conserved miR targets were obtained using a local installation of TargetScan (32Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets.Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9836) Google Scholar) and filtered against mRNA expression data (4Hardy K.M. Yatskievych T.A. Konieczka J. Bobbs A.S. Antin P.B. FGF signalling through RAS/MAPK and PI3K pathways regulates cell movement and gene expression in the chicken primitive streak without affecting E-cadherin expression.BMC Dev. Biol. 2011; 11: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to identify predicted miR mRNA targets expressed in the primitive streak. Gene Ontology (GO) terms for G. gallus proteins were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Over-represented GO terms among the targets of each FGF-regulated miR (let-7b, miR-9, miR-19b, miR-107, miR-130b, and miR-218) were identified using a χ-squared test, comparing GO term frequency in the target set versus the frequency of these terms across all proteins, adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing. To investigate the relationship between FGF signaling and miR function, miR expression in the primitive streak was assessed using a multispecies miR microarray (33Kozomara A. Griffiths-Jones S. miRBase: integrating microRNA annotation and deep-sequencing data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D152-D157Crossref PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). Of the 44 chicken miRs detected significantly above background on the microarray (p ≤ 0.05 after adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing), the expression of 40 miRs was confirmed by real-time PCR analyses (supplemental Table 1). Hybridization signal was detected for four miRs not previously identified in chicken. Expression of the minor (asterisk) sequences for miR-18a and -193b was verified by PCR. The miR-193b strand we detected is designated the major strand in other species. However, on miRBase, this is shown as the minor strand. Expression of sequences corresponding to chicken miR-let7e and -1030i was confirmed by PCR. Because these genes were not annotated on the chicken genome, BLAST analysis was used to identify potential gene locations. A putative miR-let7e gene was identified on chromosome 26, and a putative miR-1030i gene was identified on chromosome 1. These locations are syntenic with their locations in other species. Secondary structure analysis (34Sato K. Hamada M. Asai K. Mituyama T. CENTROIDFOLD: a web server for RNA secondary structure prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W277-W280Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) showed that these regions can form stem-loop structures characteristic of miR genes that would permit the processing of their primary transcripts into mature microRNAs (data not shown). To determine whether FGF signaling influences miR abundance in the primitive streak, miR expression levels were compared in RNA samples isolated from the primitive streak regions of control embryos versus embryos exposed for 5 h to the FGF receptor (FGFR) inhibitor SU5402 (4Hardy K.M. Yatskievych T.A. Konieczka J. Bobbs A.S. Antin P.B. FGF signalling through RAS/MAPK and PI3K pathways regulates cell movement and gene expression in the chicken primitive streak without affecting E-cadherin expression.BMC Dev.

Structures of the tyrosine kinase domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor in complex with inhibitors.Science. 1997; 276: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The abundance of six miRs was significantly increased following inhibition of FGF signaling, whereas only two miRs showed modest down-regulation (Fig. 1). miR let-7b levels increased almost 50-fold in response to FGF signaling inhibition, whereas the levels of miR-9, -19b, -107, -130b, and -218 increased 6.5–20-fold. miR-let-7e, identified in our microarray screen, was expressed at very low levels that were unchanged by SU5402 treatment. Other let-7 family miRs were expressed at undetectable levels in the gastrula stage chicken embryo (data not shown). ISH detection of miR expression showed that miR-let-7b, -9, -19b, -130b, and -218 were expressed in the epiblast and primitive streak, but at reduced levels in the mesoderm and endoderm (Fig. 1B). miR-107 was not consistently detected by ISH. miR abundance can be regulated transcriptionally and at multiple post-transcriptional processing steps (36Roush S. Slack F.J. The let-7 family of microRNAs.Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 505-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). To determine how FGF signaling influences miR expression, the relative abundances of primary (pri-miRs), hairpin loop intermediates (pre-miRs), and mature miR transcripts were assessed by real-time RT-PCR using primer pairs designed to amplify each type of miR transcript (Fig. 2A). Comparing RNA samples from primitive streak regions of control versus SU5402-treated embryos, pri-miR-9, let-7b, -107, and -218 were increased following inhibition of FGF signaling, with reduced or no change in pre-miR abundance (Fig. 2B). In contrast, pri- and pre-miR levels for miR-19b were increased, whereas only the pre-miR levels of miR-130b were increased. Previous studies have shown that LIN28B can negatively regulate processing of let-7 primary transcripts (21Piskounova E. Polytarchou C. Thornton J.E. LaPierre R.J. Pothoulakis C. Hagan J.P. Iliopoulos D. Gregory R.I.

Chem. 2008; 283: 21310-21314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Because LIN28B is down-regulated following inhibition of FGF signaling in the gastrula stage chicken embryo (Fig. 3A) (4Hardy K.M. Yatskievych T.A. Konieczka J. Bobbs A.S. Antin P.B. FGF signalling through RAS/MAPK and PI3K pathways regulates cell movement and gene expression in the chicken primitive streak without affecting E-cadherin expression.BMC Dev. Biol. 2011; 11: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to determine whether FGF signaling acts through LIN28B to reduce miR-let-7b abundance. LIN28B knockdown was accomplished using a splice-blocking morpholino that deletes exon 2, introducing a frameshift and a premature stop codon 11 amino acids into exon 3 (Fig. 3B). Electroporation of the LIN28B morpholino into the primitive streak region of control embryos increased mature miR-let-7b levels 2-fold relative to a control morpholino (Fig. 3C). Although LIN28B forced expression had no effect on miR-let-7b levels in untreated embryos (Fig. 3C), forced expression in SU5402-treated embryos significantly reduced miR-let-7b abundance toward control levels (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that LIN28B can modulate miR-let-7b levels in control embryos and that the dramatic (50-fold) increase in mature miR-let-7b following inhibition of FGF signaling is at least partially due to reduced LIN28B expression. The effects of LIN28B overexpression and knockdown on the levels of other FGF-regulated miR transcripts were also assessed. LIN28B morpholino knockdown decreased, and LIN28B overexpression increased, the levels of miR-130b and -19b, whereas the levels of miR-9, -107, and -218 were unaffected (Fig. 4). Together, these results show that FGF signaling negatively regulates miR abundance through LIN28B-dependent and LIN28B-independent mechanisms. To investigate the function of miRs negatively regulated by FGF signaling, bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify their predicted mRNA targets. Transcriptional profiling had previously identified 11,516 genes that are expressed in the primitive streak region of HH stage 4 chicken embryos (4Hardy K.M. Yatskievych T.A. Konieczka J. Bobbs A.S. Antin P.B. FGF signalling through RAS/MAPK and PI3K pathways regulates cell movement and gene expression in the chicken primitive streak without affecting E-cadherin expression.BMC Dev. Biol. 2011; 11: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTRs of these mRNAs were analyzed using the TargetScan algorithm (32Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P.

Most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of microRNAs.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 92-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (6362) Google Scholar) to identify mRNAs containing evolutionarily conserved seed sites for miR-let-7b, -9, -19b,-107, -130b, and -218. Approximately 580 3′-UTRs of mRNAs detected in the primitive streak contain one or more seed sequences for FGF-regulated miRs (supplemental Table 2). One 3′-UTR contains seed sites for five miRs, 16 contain seed sites for four miRs, 57 contain three seed sites, and 188 contain seed sites for two miRs. USP32, a highly conserved ubiquitin specific peptidase, is the most highly targeted mRNA (seven predicted sites). A cluster of miR-targeted mRNAs codes for proteins that regulate mRNA polyadenylation and deadenylation. CPEB proteins regulate polyadenylation and translation by binding to defined elements in the 3′-UTRs of some mRNAs (41Richter J.D. CPEB: a life in translation.Trends Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2108091529,"Mitochondrial morphology is dynamically remodeled by fusion and fission in neurons, and this process is implicated in nervous system development and pathology. However, the mechanism by which mitochondrial dynamics influence neuronal development is less clear. In this study, we found that the length of mitochondria is progressively reduced during normal development of chick embryo motoneurons (MNs), a process partly controlled by a fission-promoting protein, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Suppression of Drp1 activity by gene electroporation of dominant-negative mutant Drp1 in a subset of developing MNs increased mitochondrial length in vivo, and a greater proportion of Drp1-suppressed MNs underwent programmed cell death (PCD). By contrast, the survival of nontransfected MNs in proximity to the transfected MNs was significantly increased, suggesting that the suppression of Drp1 confers disadvantage during the competition for limited survival signals. Because we also monitored perturbation of neurite outgrowth and mitochondrial membrane depolarization following Drp1 suppression, we suggest that impairments of ATP production and axonal growth may be downstream factors that influence the competition of MNs for survival. Collectively, these results indicate that mitochondrial dynamics are required for normal axonal development and competition-dependent MN PCD."
https://openalex.org/W2020345008,"The endothelium contributes to the control of the tissue inflammatory response following stress and in particular after exposure to ionizing radiation. We previously showed that the TG-interacting factor 1 (TGIF1) plays a role in radiation-induced normal tissue injury. In this study we hypothesized that this protein could play a role in inflammation. The role of TGIF1 in the stress-induced proinflammatory phenotype was investigated in human endothelial cells. In HUVECs ionizing radiation induces TGIF1 expression as well as a proinflammatory phenotype associated with up-regulation of IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, MIP-2, and MCP-1. TGIF1 overexpression enhances the radiation-induced proinflammatory phenotype whereas TGIF1 silencing limits both the TNF-α- and radiation-induced overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, in vivo, in radiation-induced intestinal inflammation in mice, TGIF1 genetic deficiency is associated with a reduced radiation-induced overexpression of proinflammatory molecules. In HUVECs, TNF-α- and radiation-induced NF-κB pathway activation is not influenced by TGIF1 expression, whereas TGIF1 knockdown inhibits both TNF-α- and radiation-induced p38 MAPK pathway activation. This study demonstrates that TGIF1 plays a role in TNF-α- and radiation-induced inflammation and suggests that it could be a target in limiting this event in the vascular compartment."

https://openalex.org/W1967580987,"In Drosophila, the accessory gland proteins (Acps) secreted from the male accessory glands (MAGs) and transferred along with sperm into the female reproductive tract have been implicated in triggering postmating behavioral changes, including refractoriness to subsequent mating and propensity to egg laying. Recently, Acps have been found also in Anopheles, suggesting similar functions. Understanding the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of Acps and their functional role in modulating Anopheles postmating behavior may lead to the identification of novel vector control strategies to reduce mosquito populations. We identified heat-shock factor (HSF) binding sites within the Acp promoters of male Anopheles gambiae and discovered three distinct Hsf isoforms; one being significantly up-regulated in the MAGs after mating. Through genome-wide transcription analysis of Hsf-silenced males, we observed significant down-regulation in 50% of the Acp genes if compared to control males treated with a construct directed against an unrelated bacterial sequence. Treated males retained normal life span and reproductive behavior compared to control males. However, mated wild-type females showed a ~46% reduction of egg deposition rate and a ~23% reduction of hatching rate (~58% combined reduction of progeny). Our results highlight an unsuspected role of HSF in regulating Acp transcription in A. gambiae and provide evidence that Acp down-regulation in males leads a significant reduction of progeny, thus opening new avenues toward the development of novel vector control strategies.—Dottorini, T., Persampieri, T., Palladino, P., Baker, D.
