https://openalex.org/W2145657064,"Despite widespread concern about declines in pollination services, little is known about the patterns of change in most pollinator assemblages. By studying bee and hoverfly assemblages in Britain and the Netherlands, we found evidence of declines (pre-versus post-1980) in local bee diversity in both countries; however, divergent trends were observed in hoverflies. Depending on the assemblage and location, pollinator declines were most frequent in habitat and flower specialists, in univoltine species, and/or in nonmigrants. In conjunction with this evidence, outcrossing plant species that are reliant on the declining pollinators have themselves declined relative to other plant species. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a causal connection between local extinctions of functionally linked plant and pollinator species."

We demonstrate that a very high energy density with fast discharge speed and low loss can be obtained in defect-modified poly(vinylidene fluoride) polymers. This is achieved by combining nonpolar and polar molecular structural changes of the polymer with the proper dielectric constants, to avoid the electric displacement saturation at electric fields well below the breakdown field. The results indicate that a very high dielectric constant may not be desirable to reach a very high energy density."

https://openalex.org/W2029873987,"Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into nucleosome particles that occlude the DNA from interacting with most DNA binding proteins. Nucleosomes have higher affinity for particular DNA sequences, reflecting the ability of the sequence to bend sharply, as required by the nucleosome structure. However, it is not known whether these sequence preferences have a significant influence on nucleosome position in vivo, and thus regulate the access of other proteins to DNA. Here we isolated nucleosome-bound sequences at high resolution from yeast and used these sequences in a new computational approach to construct and validate experimentally a nucleosome–DNA interaction model, and to predict the genome-wide organization of nucleosomes. Our results demonstrate that genomes encode an intrinsic nucleosome organization and that this intrinsic organization can explain ∼50% of the in vivo nucleosome positions. This nucleosome positioning code may facilitate specific chromosome functions including transcription factor binding, transcription initiation, and even remodelling of the nucleosomes themselves. Eukaryotic genomes do not exist in vivo as naked DNA, but in complexes known as chromatin. Chromatin contains nucleosomes, short stretches of DNA tightly wrapped around a histone protein core, which exclude most DNA binding proteins and so act as repressors. A combined computational and experimental approach has been used to determine DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes and to predict genome-wide nucleosome organization. The yeast genome encodes an intrinsic nucleosome organization that explains about half of the in vivo nucleosome positions. Highly conserved across eukaryotes, the code directs transcription factors to their binding sites and facilitates many other specific chromosome functions. An accompanying News and Views piece discusses the role of DNA sequence and other regulators in nucleosome positioning. The cover graphic represents a stretch of chromatin including several nucleosomes. A combined computational and experimental approach is used to determine the DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes and predict genome-wide nucleosome organization. The yeast genome encodes an intrinsic nucleosome organization, which can explain about 50% of in vivo nucleosome positions."

Gold nanoparticles supported on TiO 2 or Fe 2 O 3 catalyzed the chemoselective hydrogenation of functionalized nitroarenes with H 2 under mild reaction conditions that avoided the accumulation of hydroxylamines and their potential exothermic decomposition. These chemoselective hydrogenation gold catalysts also provide a previously unknown route for the synthesis of the industrially relevant cyclohexanone oxime from 1-nitro-1-cyclohexene."

We found that aneuploidy in general and a specific segmental aneuploidy, consisting of an isochromosome composed of the two left arms of chromosome 5, were associated with azole resistance. The isochromosome forms around a single centromere flanked by an inverted repeat and was found as an independent chromosome or fused at the telomere to a full-length homolog of chromosome 5. Increases and decreases in drug resistance were strongly associated with gain and loss of this isochromosome, which bears genes expressing the enzyme in the ergosterol pathway targeted by azole drugs, efflux pumps, and a transcription factor that positively regulates a subset of efflux pump genes."

We show here that dephasing can be overcome by using a periodic train of light pulses to synchronize the phases of the precessing spins, and we demonstrate this effect in an ensemble of singly charged (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots. This mode locking leads to constructive interference of contributions to Faraday rotation and presents potential applications based on robust quantum coherence within an ensemble of dots."

We devised genetically encoded probes to assess surface potential in intact cells. These probes revealed marked, localized alterations in the charge of the inner surface of the plasma membrane of macrophages during the course of phagocytosis. Hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and displacement of phosphatidylserine accounted for the change in surface potential at the phagosomal cup. Signaling molecules such as K-Ras, Rac1, and c-Src that are targeted to the membrane by electrostatic interactions were rapidly released from membrane subdomains where the surface charge was altered by lipid remodeling during phagocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W3099855100,"In conventional superconductors, the most direct evidence of the mechanism responsible for superconductivity comes from tunnelling experiments, which provide a clear picture of the underlying electron–phonon interactions1,2. As the coherence length in conventional superconductors is large, the tunnelling process probes several atomic layers into the bulk of the material; the observed structure in the current–voltage characteristics at the phonon energies gives1, through inversion of the Eliashberg equations, the electron–phonon spectral density α2F(ω). The situation is different for the high-temperature copper oxide superconductors, where the coherence length (particularly for c-axis tunnelling) can be very short. Because of this, methods such as optical spectroscopy and neutron scattering provide a better route for investigating the underlying mechanism, as they probe bulk properties. Accurate reflection measurements at infrared wavelengths and precise polarized neutron-scattering data are now available for a variety of the copper oxides3,4,5, and here we show that the conducting carriers (probed by infrared spectroscopy) are strongly coupled to a resonance structure in the spectrum of spin fluctuations (measured by neutron scattering). The coupling strength inferred from those results is sufficient to account for the high transition temperatures of the copper oxides, highlighting a prominent role for spin fluctuations in driving superconductivity in these materials."
https://openalex.org/W2114431583,CorA family members are ubiquitously distributed transporters of divalent metal cations and are considered to be the primary Mg 2+ transporter of Bacteria and Archaea. We have determined a 2.9 angstrom resolution structure of CorA from Thermotoga maritima that reveals a pentameric cone–shaped protein. Two potential regulatory metal binding sites are found in the N-terminal domain that bind both Mg 2+ and Co 2+ . The structure of CorA supports an efflux system involving dehydration and rehydration of divalent metal ions potentially mediated by a ring of conserved aspartate residues at the cytoplasmic entrance and a carbonyl funnel at the periplasmic side of the pore.
https://openalex.org/W2048644187,"The melanization reaction is used as an immune mechanism in arthropods to encapsulate and kill microbial pathogens. In Drosophila, the serpin Spn27A regulates melanization apparently by inhibiting the protease that activates phenoloxidase, the key enzyme in melanin synthesis. Here, we have described the genetic characterization of two immune inducible serine proteases, MP1 and MP2, which act in a melanization cascade regulated by Spn27A. MP1 is required to activate melanization in response to both bacterial and fungal infection, whereas MP2 is mainly involved during fungal infection. Pathogenic bacteria and fungi may therefore trigger two different melanization cascades that use MP1 as a common downstream protease to activate phenoloxidase. We have also shown that the melanization reaction activated by MP1 and MP2 plays an important role in augmenting the effectiveness of other immune reactions, thereby promoting resistance of Drosophila to microbial infection.

Drosophila utilizes multiple defense mechanisms against microbial pathogens (1Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). A major mechanism is the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides that kill pathogens in the hemolymph. Genetic studies have revealed that the Toll and Imd signaling pathways regulate antimicrobial peptide expression. The Toll pathway is important for the defense against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi (2Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). Upon infection, secreted pattern recognition receptors recognize microbial cell wall components and then trigger cleavage of the Spätzle protein to generate the ligand that activates Toll signaling in the fat body, an immune-responsive tissue. GNBP1 and PGRP-SA are two pattern recognition receptors that act upstream of Toll and recognize Gram-positive bacteria (3Michel T. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Royet J. Nature. 2001; 414: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 4Gobert V. Gottar M. Matskevich A.A. Rutschmann S. Royet J. Belvin M. Hoffmann J.A. Ferrandon D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 12848-12853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Toll activation by fungal infection is independent of GNBP1 and PGRP-SA but involves the serine protease Persephone (6Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and regulation by the serpin-type protease inhibitor Necrotic (7Levashina E.A. Langley E. Green C. Gubb D. Ashburner M. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 1999; 285: 1917-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial peptides against Gram-negative bacteria are induced under the control of the Imd pathway (8Lemaitre B. Kromer-Metzger E. Michaut L. Nicolas E. Meister M. Georgel P. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9465-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The Toll and Imd pathways are homologous to the mammalian Toll-like receptor and tumor necrosis factor pathways, respectively, reflecting the evolutionary conservation of the innate immune systems between insects and mammals (1Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). The melanization reaction is the most immediate immune response against invading pathogens in Drosophila (9Cerenius L. Soderhall K. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Although melanization is apparently not used as a defense mechanism in mammals, it serves as a major immune response against the malaria parasite in the mosquito (10Christensen B.M. Li J. Chen C.C. Nappi A.J. Trends Parasitol. 2005; 21: 192-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Melanization is visible by the blackening of a wound site or the surface of pathogens, which results from the synthesis and deposition of melanin. In addition to being important for wound healing, melanin can encapsulate and sequester pathogens, and the reaction intermediates appear to be directly toxic to microbes as well (11Nappi A.J. Christensen B.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 443-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). During melanization, the enzyme phenoloxidase (PO) 4The abbreviations used are: PO, phenoloxidase; PPO, prophenoloxidase; PPAE, PPO-activating enzyme; MP, melanization protease; RNAi, RNA interference.4The abbreviations used are: PO, phenoloxidase; PPO, prophenoloxidase; PPAE, PPO-activating enzyme; MP, melanization protease; RNAi, RNA interference. catalyzes the oxidation of phenols to quinones, which then polymerize non-enzymatically to form melanin. In Drosophila and other arthropods, PO is produced and released into the hemolymph as an inactive zymogen called prophenoloxidase (PPO). Biochemical studies in larger insect species have identified proteases involved in melanization, including PPO-activating enzyme (PPAE) that directly cleaves and activates PPO at the end of a cascade upon microbial infection (12Satoh D. Horii A. Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7441-7453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13Kanost M.R. Jiang H. Yu X.Q. Immunol.

Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These studies have also identified serpins as being involved in regulating the melanization cascade. Recent genetic studies in Drosophila have provided new insights into the mechanisms that regulate the melanization reaction. The pattern recognition receptor called PGRP-LE is involved in inducing melanization in response to Gram-negative bacteria (15Takehana A. Yano T. Mita S. Kotani A. Oshima Y. Kurata S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4690-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, the serpin Spn27A inhibits activation of the melanization reaction (16De Gregorio E. Han S.J. Lee W.J. Baek M.J. Osaki T. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Iwanaga S. Lemaitre B. Brey P.T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 581-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 17Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Ji C. Leclerc V. Duvic B. Belvin M. Jiang H. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6330-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The target of Spn27A is thought to be PPAE, the protease that cleaves PPO, as recombinant Spn27A inhibits the beetle PPAE in vitro (16De Gregorio E. Han S.J. Lee W.J. Baek M.J. Osaki T. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Iwanaga S. Lemaitre B. Brey P.T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 581-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, the endogenous target of Spn27A in Drosophila has remained unknown. Here, we have described the identification of two proteases named MP1 and MP2 (melanization protease) that define a melanization cascade regulated by Spn27A, which is activated by microbial infection in Drosophila. Our data suggest the existence of two melanization cascades, one involving MP2 activated primarily by fungal infection and the other involving an analogous protease activated by bacterial infection, which converge on MP1 as a common activator of phenoloxidase. Our data also suggest that the melanization reaction, although not essential for survival following microbial infection, plays a critical role in enhancing the effectiveness of other immune reactions in Drosophila.

The Bloomington Stock Center was the source of all other stocks. In our hands, ∼6% of spn27A1 homozygotes were viable as adults, and of these, ∼80% showed constitutive melanization (see Fig. 1A). The two deficiencies that suppressed spn27A melanization >5-fold were Df(3R)ME15 and Df(3R)dsx11, which respectively uncovered the genes CG1102 and CG3066, encoding clip proteases named MP1 and MP2. The cDNAs GH02921 and LP12377 for MP1 and MP2, respectively, were obtained from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center. To make constructs for overexpression of MP1 and MP2, DNA fragments encoding full-length MP1 and MP2 protein or just the catalytic domain of these proteases were generated by PCR using cDNA templates and cloned into the pUASP vector (21Rorth P. Mech. Dev. 1998; 78: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The Easter signal sequence was attached to the catalytic domains of MP1 and MP2 to make the preactivated forms of these proteases (22Chasan R. Anderson K.V. Cell. 1989; 56: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To make the MP1 and MP2 RNAi constructs, PCR fragments of ∼600 bp of the appropriate cDNAs were cloned as inverted repeats into the pWIZ vector (23Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Methods (Duluth). 2003; 30: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Results were obtained with at least two independently generated transgenic lines bearing the MP1 and MP2 RNAi constructs. The Spn27A RNAi construct was made using the pUAST-R57 vector essentially as described earlier (20Kambris Z. Brun S. Jang I.H. Nam H.J. Romeo Y. Takahashi K. Lee W.J. Ueda R. Lemaitre B. Curr.

Microbial Infection and Survival Measurement—For septic injury, adult flies were pierced in the lateral side of the thorax with a tungsten needle of 0.1 mm diameter previously dipped into a concentrated microbial culture (24Tzou P. Meister M. Lemaitre B. Methods Microbiol. 2001; 31: 507-529Crossref Google Scholar). The flies were photographed ∼24 h after infection. For Beauveria bassiana infection, anesthetized flies were placed onto a plate containing a carpet of the fungus, agitated until covered by spores, and incubated at 29 °C for further analysis (24Tzou P. Meister M. Lemaitre B. Methods Microbiol. 2001; 31: 507-529Crossref Google Scholar). To measure survival after microbial infection, the flies were transferred to fresh vials every 2–3 days after infection, and the number of live insects was recorded (24Tzou P. Meister M. Lemaitre B. Methods Microbiol. 2001; 31: 507-529Crossref Google Scholar). PO Activity Assay—PO activity was assayed 4 h after septic injury or 24 h after natural fungal infection, essentially as described previously (25Pye A.E. Nature. 1974; 251: 610-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The hemolymph of 30 adult flies was collected with a microcapillary and then squeezed into 20 μlof phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors on ice. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Five μg of total hemolymph proteins in 40 μlof phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors was mixed with 120 μl of phosphate-buffered saline saturated with l-3,4-dihydroxiphenylalanine. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the absorbance at 490 nm of the samples was measured. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Identification of Proteases MP1 and MP2 in a Screen for Suppression of the spn27A Melanization Phenotype—The serpin Spn27A regulates the melanization reaction in Drosophila, as loss of spn27A function leads to constitutive melanization (Fig. 1A) and semilethality (16De Gregorio E. Han S.J. Lee W.J. Baek M.J. Osaki T. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Iwanaga S. Lemaitre B. Brey P.T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 581-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 17Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Ji C. Leclerc V. Duvic B. Belvin M. Jiang H. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6330-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the melanization reaction, Spn27A is presumed to inhibit PPAE, the terminal protease that activates PO (Fig. 1B). Spn27A is also maternally required for embryonic dorsoventral patterning (26Hashimoto C. Kim D.R. Weiss L.A. Miller J.W. Morisato D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 945-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Ligoxygakis P. Roth S. Reichhart J.M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2097-2102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), where its target is Easter, the terminal protease in a cascade leading to activation of Toll signaling (Fig. 1B). Loss of maternal Spn27A results in a ventralized embryo phenotype, which can be partially rescued by the reduction in gene dosage of Easter (26Hashimoto C. Kim D.R. Weiss L.A. Miller J.W. Morisato D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 945-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). By analogy, we thought that the suppression of the constitutive melanization phenotype caused by the loss of spn27A function could be used as a genetic strategy to uncover the target of Spn27A and other proteases in the melanization cascade. Using standard crosses, we generated flies homozygous for the null mutation spn27A1 and heterozygous for one of 12 chromosomal deficiencies that uncovered 13 different serine proteases of the clip family. We focused on clip proteases, which contained an N-terminal clip domain in addition to a C-terminal catalytic domain (Fig. 1C), because Easter is a clip protease and all known PPAEs identified biochemically in arthropods are also clip proteases (9Cerenius L. Soderhall K. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Of the 12 deficiencies screened, two showed significant (5–10-fold) suppression of the spn27A melanization phenotype (see “Materials and Methods”). These two deficiencies uncovered the genes CG1102 and CG3066, which encoded two clip proteases, hereafter called MP1 and MP2, respectively. In the catalytic domain, MP1 and MP2 were 56 and 44% identical to Easter, respectively, and similar to Easter, had sequence features (such as codon usage for the catalytic serine) shared by serine proteases that apparently define the most evolutionarily ancient class and occupy the most down-stream positions within cascades (Fig. 1C) (28Krem M.M. Cera E.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MP1 and MP2 were shown by microarray analysis to be up-regulated upon bacterial and fungal infection in a Toll-dependent manner (29De Gregorio E. Spellman P.T. Rubin G.M. Lemaitre B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12590-12595Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 30De Gregorio E. Spellman P.T. Tzou P. Rubin G.M. Lemaitre B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). To test that suppression of the spn27A melanization phenotype was due to functional reduction of MP1 or MP2 instead of another gene within the two deficiencies that uncover these proteases, we wanted to specifically lower the expression level of MP1 and MP2. We decided to use RNAi to knock down their expression and therefore generate transgenic flies that could express double-stranded RNA targeting either MP1 or MP2 for RNAi under the control of the UAS sequence element and the Gal4 transcriptional regulator (31Duffy J.B. Genesis. 2002; 34: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The act-Gal4 or da-Gal4 “driver,” in which Gal4 protein is broadly expressed under the actin or daughterless gene promoter, induces the expression of UAS-coupled genes throughout development in virtually all tissues. To drive such ubiquitous activation of MP1 or MP2 RNAi, we generated flies carrying the act-Gal4 driver and the UAS construct encoding double-stranded RNA targeting MP1 or MP2. These MP1 and MP2 RNAi flies were viable to the adult stage, except for ∼50% of the insects that died at the late pupal stage or during eclosion. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that MP1 and MP2 expression was specifically knocked down in each case ∼10-fold from the wild-type level (data not shown). In addition, the lethality and constitutive melanization caused by loss of normal Spn27A function was completely suppressed in flies in which either MP1 or MP2 RNAi was simultaneously induced with Spn27A RNAi using the da-Gal4 driver (data not shown). These results suggest that MP1 and MP2 are involved in the melanization reaction that is negatively regulated by Spn27A. While we were preparing this work for publication, MP2 was reported to be involved in activating melanization (32Castillejo-Lopez C. Hacker U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33Leclerc V. Pelte N. El Chamy L. Martinelli C. Ligoxygakis P. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). MP1 and MP2 Are Required to Activate Melanization and PO Activity upon Microbial Infection—To test directly a requirement for MP1 and MP2 in the melanization reaction, we examined the ability of MP1 and MP2 RNAi flies to activate melanization upon microbial infection. Flies were pierced with a tungsten needle previously dipped into a concentrated solution of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus. A few hours after piercing, significant melanization around the wound site was seen in control flies (Fig. 2A) but not in flies in which MP1 or MP2 RNAi was induced with act-Gal4 (Fig. 2, B and C). To examine whether MP1 and MP2 are required to activate PO, we assayed PO enzymatic activity in hemolymph extracted from adult flies (Fig. 2D). In uninfected wild-type flies, only a low level of PO activity was detected; however, 4 h after septic injury with E. coli and M. luteus, a dramatically higher level of PO activity was seen. Overexpression of Spn27A blocked the induction of PO activity by bacterial infection. When MP1 RNAi flies were similarly infected, no significant PO activity was detected in the hemolymph 4 h after infection. In MP2 RNAi flies after bacterial infection, PO activity was significantly lowered but not completely blocked. Similar results were obtained by infecting MP2 RNAi flies with E. coli and M. luteus separately (data not shown). We also checked hemolymph PO activity after natural infection by the fungus B. bassiana (Fig. 2E). In wild-type flies, significant PO activity was induced 24 h after B. bassiana infection, although the level was lower than that after bacterial septic injury. MP1 RNAi flies again showed only a background level of PO activity after fungal infection. Interestingly, no significant PO activity was seen in MP2 RNAi flies after fungal infection, in contrast to the lowered activity seen after bacterial infection. Altogether, these data indicate that MP1 and MP2 are required to activate melanization and PO after microbial infection. They also suggest that MP1 is involved in the response to bacteria and fungi, whereas MP2 is more specifically involved in the response to fungi. MP1 or MP2 Activity Is Sufficient to Induce Constitutive Melanization and PO Activity—To check whether MP1 or MP2 activity is sufficient to induce constitutive melanization and PO activity, we generated transgenic flies in which the UAS/Gal4 system could be used to overexpress a preactivated form of MP1 or MP2 consisting of just the catalytic domain after signal sequence cleavage. Larvae in which preactivated MP1 was induced with act-Gal4 developed more slowly than wild-type larvae. Approximately 85% of these larvae showed constitutive melanization and eventually died with melanization visible over the whole body (Fig. 3B). The remaining 15% developed to the pupal and adult stages with no apparent defect. When we used the c564-Gal4 driver expressed in the fat body and hemocytes to induce the overexpression of preactivated MP1, most of the insects were able to survive to or beyond the pupal stage; however, 10% of the pupae and 30% of the adults showed constitutive melanization. The ubiquitous overexpression of preactivated MP2 seemed to have a weaker effect. Approximately 10% of the larvae showed constitutive melanization (Fig. 3C), and most larvae developed into pupae, of which ∼40% showed constitutive melanization (Fig. 3E). Most of these melanized pupae died. Among ∼50% of the insects that survived to adulthood, ∼5% showed a constitutive melanization phenotype (Fig. 3G). Most of the melanization appeared to be under the epithelia and in the hemolymph. We also checked PO activity in the hemolymph of flies over-expressing preactivated MP1 or MP2 (Fig. 3H). Consistent with the melanization phenotype described above, a high level of hemolymph PO activity was detected in these flies even without any microbial infection. This level was nearly comparable with the levels seen in wild-type flies 4 h after microbial infection or in spn27A1 flies. These results indicate that preactivated MP1 or MP2 is sufficient to induce the activation of melanization and PO activity. Flies ubiquitously overexpressing the full-length form of either MP1 or MP2 were completely viable. Only a few (2–3%) displayed some melanization spots, and none produced significant constitutive PO activity (data not shown). These results indicate that MP1 and MP2 must be activated by zymogen cleavage to induce melanization and PO activity. The induction of melanization and PO activity by overexpression of preactivated MP1 or MP2 was blocked by simultaneous overexpression of Spn27A (Fig. 3H). This result indicates that MP1 and MP2 cannot act downstream of the direct target of Spn27A, which is presumed to be the terminal protease in the melanization cascade that activates PO. MP1 and MP2 Function Sequentially in Activating Melanization and PO Activity—Lethality and melanization caused by the loss of Spn27A function are completely suppressed by RNAi knockdown of either MP1 or MP2. Moreover, MP1 and MP2 are both required, whereas preactivated MP1 or MP2 is each sufficient to induce melanization and PO activity. These observations suggest that the two proteases act in a common pathway rather than in independent pathways. To test whether MP1 and MP2 act sequentially, as in a zymogen activation cascade, we examined whether RNAi of one protease could block the induction of melanization and PO activity caused by overexpression of the preactivated form of the other protease. We found that melanization and PO activity induced by overexpression of preactivated MP2 was completely blocked by MP1 RNAi (Fig. 3H). In the reciprocal experiment, MP2 RNAi did not block the melanization of larvae induced by overexpression of preactivated MP1 (as seen in Fig. 3B). PO activity in adult hemolymph could not be assayed in this case, as simultaneous induction of MP2 RNAi and preactivated MP1 overexpression led to complete lethality, compared with 85% lethality from preactivated MP1 overexpression alone (see above) before the adult stage. These results are consistent with MP2 functioning genetically upstream of MP1 to activate melanization and PO. MP1 and MP2 Do Not Require Toll Signaling to Activate Melanization—An earlier study suggests that melanization requires activation of the Toll signaling pathway to deplete Spn27A (17Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Ji C. Leclerc V. Duvic B. Belvin M. Jiang H. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6330-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To investigate whether MP1 and MP2 activate melanization through Toll, we overexpressed preactivated MP1 or MP2 in flies homozygous for spzrm7, a loss-of-function mutation in the spätzle gene encoding the Toll ligand. We found that spzrm7 did not block constitutive melanization (as seen in Fig. 3B) and larval lethality caused by overexpression of preactivated MP1. Indeed, spzrm7 enhanced the partial lethality caused by preactivated MP1 overexpression alone (see above), causing complete lethality before the adult stage that precluded the assay of PO activity in adult hemolymph. However, we determined that spzrm7 did not block the high PO activity produced by overexpression of preactivated MP2 (Fig. 3H). Thus, MP1 and MP2 appear to regulate melanization and PO activation, in large part, independently of the Toll signaling pathway. Melanization Is Important for Enhancing the Effectiveness of Other Immune Reactions—As no significant PO activity is detectable in MP1 RNAi flies after bacterial or fungal infection (Fig. 2), we used these flies to address whether the melanization reaction is important for resistance to microbial infection. Flies were challenged with a Gram-negative bacterium (Erwinia carotovora), a Gram-positive bacterium (Enterococcus faecalis) or the fungus Candida albicans, or naturally infected with the entomopathogenic fungus B. bassiana. The survival rate of MP1 RNAi flies was not significantly different from wild-type flies after all types of infection (Fig. 4, A–C, and data not shown). Similar results were obtained for MP2 RNAi flies after infection with bacteria (Fig. 4, A and B) or the fungus C. albicans (data not shown). These results suggest that the melanization reaction is largely dispensable for resistance to microbial infection. A similar conclusion was reached from a recent independent study of MP2 (33Leclerc V. Pelte N. El Chamy L. Martinelli C. Ligoxygakis P. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, we found that the melanization reaction was important for resistance to microbial infection in flies impaired in the Toll or the Imd pathway controlling antimicrobial peptide synthesis. For example, after infection with the Gram-negative bacterium E. carotovora, the survival rate was moderately lower for flies in which MP1 (or MP2) and dFadd in the Imd pathway were both knocked down by RNAi compared with flies in which just dFadd was knocked down (Fig. 4D). A similar decrease in the survival rate of flies from RNAi knockdown of MP1 (or MP2) and Dif in the Toll pathway, compared with knockdown of just Dif, was observed after infection with the fungus C. albicans (Fig. 4F). Such a distinct synergistic effect was less discernible after infection with the Gram-positive bacterium E. faecalis, perhaps because of the rapid death of the flies (Fig. 4E). We note that the differences in relative survival rates described here, although modest, were reproducible despite the variability in absolute survival rates between experiments. These observations suggest that the melanization reaction, although not essential for resistance to microbial infection, can play an important role in enhancing the effectiveness of other immune reactions. Interestingly, compared with MP1 RNAi flies, MP2 RNAi flies were less viable after natural infection with the fungus B. bassiana (Fig. 4C). The pronounced difference in susceptibility to fungal infection made us wonder whether MP2 might have a role in activating the Toll antifungal pathway in addition to its role in activating melanization. Consequently, we monitored in MP1 RNAi and MP2 RNAi flies the expression of Drosomycin, an antifungal peptide gene regulated mainly by the Toll pathway, and of Diptericin, an antibacterial peptide gene regulated by the Imd pathway. As measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 4, G–I) and reporter gene expression (data not shown), the knockdown of MP1 or MP2 had no significant effect on the induction of Diptericin after infection by E. carotovora, indicating that MP1 and MP2 do not regulate the Imd pathway and that the fat body, the site of antimicrobial peptide expression, is still functional (Fig. 4G). However, MP2 RNAi (but not MP1 RNAi) adults showed reduced Drosomycin expression, ∼50% of the wild-type level, after infection with the fungus B. bassiana (Fig. 4I). MP2 RNAi did not similarly reduce Drosomycin expression after challenge by the Gram-positive bacterium M. luteus (Fig. 4H). These results suggest that MP2 has a role in activating Drosomycin expression in response to natural fungal infection. Melanization is a conserved host defense reaction in insects and other arthropods, such as in the mosquito, where it is a critical determinant of resistance to the malarial parasite. A recent key finding revealed that Spn27A, a serpin-type protease inhibitor, is a negative regulator of melanization in Drosophila. In this study, we have used suppression of the spn27A melanization phenotype as a genetic strategy to identify two Drosophila proteases, MP1 and MP2, having essential roles in activating melanization in response to microbial infection. Our data are consistent with MP2 acting genetically upstream of MP1 and thus with MP2 activating MP1 in a protease cascade leading to melanization (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the application of evolutionary markers suggests that MP1 and MP2 belong to the primordial class of serine proteases that tend to function most downstream in a protease cascade, as in the case of Easter and its direct activator involved in activating Toll during development (Fig. 1C). However, we have not been able to demonstrate that MP2 directly activates MP1, as MP2 failed to cleave the zymogen form of MP1 when co-expressed in transfected Drosophila S2 cells, thereby suggesting that another protease acts in between MP2 and MP1. As the protease down-stream of MP2 that acts either in parallel to or upstream of Spn27A, MP1 is a candidate to be PPAE, the terminal protease in the melanization cascade that cleaves PPO as well as the putative direct target of Spn27A. We have not detected cleavage of PPO by MP1 when assayed by co-expression in transfected S2 cells. 5H. Tang and C. Hashimoto, unpublished data. However, biochemical studies in the beetle and tobacco hornworm have identified a non-enzymatic cofactor required for PPO cleavage by PPAE to generate PO activity in vitro (13Kanost M.R. Jiang H. Yu X.Q. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 34Kwon T.H. Kim M.S. Choi H.W. Joo C.H. Cho M.Y. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6188-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which may indicate that such a cofactor is required to demonstrate PPO cleavage by MP1. Our data suggest that another melanization cascade exists in Drosophila besides the one that we have defined involving MP1 and MP2. In activating melanization and PO activity, MP1 is essential during both bacterial and fungal infection, whereas MP2 is essential during fungal infection and partially required during bacterial infection (Fig. 2D and E). Thus, another protease may function analogously to MP2 in activating MP1 during bacterial infection (Fig. 5). The convergence of two different melanization cascades on MP1 is consistent with the idea that MP1 is the shared terminal protease of both cascades that activates phenoloxidase. We presume that MP1 and MP2 activate melanization in the hemolymph. As both MP1 and MP2 have an N-terminal signal sequence for secretion, they may be secreted by the fat body and/or blood cells into the hemolymph. This possibility is consistent with the detection of MP1 and MP2 in extracted hemolymph when epitope-tagged versions of the full-length proteases are overexpressed with act-Gal4 (data not shown) and with constitutive melanization induced by overexpression of preactivated MP1 using the c564-Gal4 driver, which is expressed in the fat body and hemocytes (see “Results”). MP1 and MP2 define a protease cascade distinct from the one that may activate the Toll pathway, as they activate melanization independently of this pathway (Fig. 3). However, we found that MP2 (but not MP1) is important for the induction of Drosomycin expression and for viability of Drosophila following natural fungal infection (Fig. 4). One explanation is that MP2 activates two distinct pathways, one leading to melanization and the other leading to the induction of Drosomycin expression (Fig. 5), and that this dual role is important for resistance to natural fungal infection. Preliminary experiments indicate that overexpression of preactivated MP2 does not induce Drosomycin expression in non-infected adult flies, unlike in the case of the Persephone protease (6Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting that MP2 does not induce Drosomycin expression by directly activating the Toll pathway. Nonetheless, there may exist cross-talk between melanization and the Toll pathway mediated by MP2 involving an as yet undefined mechanism. Surprisingly, the melanization reaction does not appear to be critical for survival of Drosophila after bacterial or fungal infection (Fig. 4; 33Leclerc V. Pelte N. El Chamy L. Martinelli C. Ligoxygakis P. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, we observed that the inability to activate melanization is detrimental when flies are also defective in the Toll or the Imd pathway controlling antimicrobial peptide synthesis (Fig. 4). Melanization is an immediate immune response that temporally precedes the induction of antimicrobial peptide synthesis, which requires gene transcription. Consequently, melanization may play a crucial role in weakening a microbial infection, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of subsequent immune reactions. Having a single switch, such as MP2, to activate a temporal sequence of immune reactions would therefore seem to be an advantageous mechanism for ensuring a potent defense against a microbial pathogen. In conclusion, we have identified two serine proteases among the large set of serine proteases encoded in the Drosophila genome as being essential components of a melanization cascade activated by microbial infection. A major goal in future studies will be to delineate the entire cascade from the pattern recognition receptor that triggers the cascade to the putative cofactor required for phenoloxidase activation."

Sequence analysis demonstrated an aerotolerant, H 2 /CO 2 -dependent lifestyle and enzymatic capacities for carbohydrate metabolism and assimilatory sulfate reduction, hitherto unknown among methanogens.

https://openalex.org/W2027478967,"Ribonucleotide reductase synthesizes deoxyribonucleotides, which are essential building blocks for DNA synthesis. The mammalian ribonucleotide reductase is described as an α2β2 complex consisting of R1 (α) and R2 (β) proteins. ATP stimulates and dATP inhibits enzyme activity by binding to an allosteric site called the activity site on the R1 protein. Despite the opposite effects by ATP and dATP on enzyme activity, both nucleotides induce formation of R1 oligomers. By using a new technique termed Gas-phase Electrophoretic-Mobility Macromolecule Analysis (GEMMA), we have found that the ATP/dATP-induced R1 oligomers have a defined size (hexamers) and can interact with the R2 dimer to form an enzymatically active protein complex (α6β2). The newly discovered α6β2 complex can either be in an active or an inhibited state depending on whether ATP or dATP is bound. Our results suggest that this protein complex is the major form of ribonucleotide reductase at physiological levels of R1-R2 protein and nucleotides. Ribonucleotide reductase synthesizes deoxyribonucleotides, which are essential building blocks for DNA synthesis.

The newly discovered α6β2 complex can either be in an active or an inhibited state depending on whether ATP or dATP is bound. Our results suggest that this protein complex is the major form of ribonucleotide reductase at physiological levels of R1-R2 protein and nucleotides. Ribonucleotide reductase is a key enzyme to synthesize a balanced supply of the four dNTPs used as building blocks for DNA synthesis (1Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The mammalian ribonucleotide reductase reduces ribonucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, which are further metabolized in the cell to become dCTP, dTTP, dATP, and dGTP. This enzyme consists of two different proteins called R1 (α) and R2 (β) that are both required for enzymatic activity. The R2 protein is a dimer (2 × 45 kDa), and each polypeptide contains a tyrosyl radical that is generated and stabilized by an iron center. Electrons are shuttled between the tyrosyl radical and the active site in the R1 protein where the actual catalysis occurs. The R1 protein contains a substrate-binding site and two allosteric effector-binding sites termed the specificity and activity sites, respectively. ATP and dATP bind to both allosteric sites, whereas dGTP and dTTP bind to only the specificity site. In the absence of nucleotide effectors, the mammalian R1 protein is a 90-kDa monomer. Allosteric effectors that only bind to the specificity site (dTTP or dGTP) induce the formation of an enzymatically active α2β2 complex by stimulating R1 dimer formation and R1-R2 interaction (2Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The specificity site determines which substrate is to be reduced. When ATP (or dATP used at low concentration) is bound to this site, the enzyme reduces CDP and UDP. In a similar manner, dTTP stimulates GDP reduction and dGTP stimulates ADP reduction. By having this regulation, the enzyme ensures that there will be a balanced supply of all four dNTPs in the cell. The mechanism behind the specificity site function is known from experiments where the R1 dimer has been crystallized together with various allosteric effectors and substrates. When a specificity site effector is bound to one of the two R1 polypeptides, a conformational change is induced in a connecting loop that influences binding of the correct substrate to the second R1 polypeptide (3Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Therefore, R1 dimer formation is a prerequisite for the specificity site regulation to function properly. The activity site regulates the overall activity of the enzyme, which is important for controlling the optimal cellular levels of dNTPs as too high levels (or an imbalance between the four dNTPs) lead to an increased mutation rate (4Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The overall activity is controlled by ATP and dATP binding to the activity site (1Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The binding of ATP to this site induces an increased enzyme activity (hyperactivity) compared with when only the specificity site is occupied (5Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2948-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When total cellular dNTPs are high, dATP out-competes ATP for binding to the activity site and the enzyme is shut off. The effect of dATP is concentration dependent (6Eriksson S. Gudas L.J. Clift S.M. Caras I.W. Ullman B. Martin Jr., D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10193-10197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At low concentrations (∼2 μm), it acts as a pure specificity site regulator and directs CDP and UDP reduction. At higher concentrations, it binds to both allosteric sites and then the enzyme activity is turned off. The mechanism behind the activity site regulation is not well understood, but it has been suggested that R1 oligomer formation might play a role in the function of the activity site (7Kashlan O.B. Scott C.P. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has been observed in glycerol gradients and dynamic light scattering experiments that the R1 protein forms oligomers in the presence of the activity site effectors ATP or dATP (7Kashlan O.B. Scott C.P. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9Thelander L. Eriksson S. Åkerman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7426-7432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was not clear whether these oligomers can bind the R2 subunit. A problem when studying ribonucleotide reductase with traditional methods such as glycerol gradients and gel filtration is that the R1-R2 complexes are unstable and fall apart during analysis. Another uncertainty was that many of these experiments were performed at a 100-fold higher R1 protein concentration than in the cell where the concentration is estimated to be 0.05 mg/ml (10Håkansson P. Hofer A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7834-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). With Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore), it was possible to measure R1 protein binding to an immobilized R2 subunit. The conclusion from this study was that all nucleotide effectors strongly induce the binding of R1 dimers to the R2 subunit (2Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is a paradox that dATP/ATP, which stimulates the formation of R1 oligomers rather than dimers in glycerol gradients and dynamic light scattering experiments, is the strongest inducer of α2β2 complexes in Biacore. Therefore, it has been questioned whether the R2 protein is immobilized in such a way that higher complexes cannot bind or that the R1 oligomers are destabilized by the chip surface. Obviously, new techniques are needed to clarify how ATP and dATP influence the mammalian ribonucleotide reductase quaternary structure. Gas-phase electrophoretic-mobility macromolecule analysis (GEMMA) 2The abbreviations used are: GEMMA, gas-phase electrophoretic-mobility macromolecule analysis/analyzer; h-site, hexamerization site.2The abbreviations used are: GEMMA, gas-phase electrophoretic-mobility macromolecule analysis/analyzer; h-site, hexamerization site. is a relatively new method to study protein complexes in solution: a diluted protein sample (usually 10 ng/μl) is transmitted into the gas phase by a charged reduced electrospray process (11Kaufman S.L.

Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 1038-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The generated particles, each containing one protein molecule with a +1 charge, are separated according to size in a differential mobility analyzer and subsequently quantified by a particle counter. In contrast to mass spectrometry, this method is run at atmospheric pressure and measures the diameter of the particle rather than the mass. However, because particle diameter and mass are correlated to each other, the mass can usually be determined with an error of ± 5.6% (12Bacher G. Szymanski W.W. Kaufman S.L. Zollner P. Blaas D. Allmaier G. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 1038-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry can be used to obtain exact masses of protein complexes, but the sensitivity is strongly biased toward small protein complexes (13Sobott F. Robinson C.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Taken together, we think the two methods complement each other, with GEMMA providing quantitative information about the protein complexes while mass spectrometry determines the exact size of these complexes. In this study, we analyzed how various nucleotide effectors affect the quaternary structure of mouse ribonucleotide reductase by gel filtration, GEMMA, and mass spectrometry. In agreement with previous studies, we found that nucleotide effectors that bind only to the specificity site induce the formation of R1 dimers. The R1 dimers can interact with the R2 dimer, forming an enzymatically active α2β2 complex. However, in the presence of ATP or dATP both allosteric sites become occupied and then R1 hexamers are formed. These hexamers can interact with the R2 dimer, forming α6β2 complexes. The α6β2 complex could either be in a hyperactive form in the presence of ATP or in an inactive form in the presence of dATP. Protein Purification—The R1 protein was expressed in a ClpB-negative Escherichia coli pLysS (DE3) strain (see “Acknowledgments”). The R1 protein was induced with 0.05 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 15 °C and purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and dATP-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (14Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse R2 protein (as well as mutants of the R2 protein) was expressed and purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE chromatography as described previously (15Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The R1 and R2 proteins were quantified by UV light absorption using extinction coefficients of E1%1 cm (280 nm) = 12.0 (9Thelander L. Eriksson S. Åkerman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7426-7432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and E1%1 cm (280–310 nm) = 13.8, respectively (15Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The specific activities of the R1 and R2 proteins varied between different preparations but were relatively similar (±50%) to those previously reported (14Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G.

Gel Filtration Analysis of the R1 Protein—The R1 protein was analyzed on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences). The mobile phase contained 150 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and various concentrations of different nucleotides. The R1 protein was premixed with the mobile phase to a concentration of 0.02–0.25 mg/ml (100-μl sample) before analysis. The column was connected to a UV detector (UV 2075 Plus; Jasco), and detection was performed at 290 nm to minimize the background absorbance from the nucleotides in the mobile phase without losing too much sensitivity for protein detection. The molecular masses of the R1 complexes were obtained by comparing the retention time to a molecular mass standard composed of thyroglobulin (669 kDa; 17.14 min), ferritin (440 kDa; 20.08 min), IgG (159 kDa; 23.39 min), transferrin (80 kDa; 26.76 min), ovalbumin (43 kDa; 29.63 min), and myoglobin (16.9 kDa; 33.87 min). Ribonucleotide Reductase Assays—Enzyme assays were performed using R1 protein (varied between 0 and 2 μg) and R2 protein (4 μg) in 50 μl of a buffer containing 3 mm ATP, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm [5-3H]CDP (Amersham Biosciences), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm FeCl3, 100 mm KCl, 8 mm Hepes-KOH, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (Tris/KCl buffer). The reaction mixture (50 μl) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the amount of [5-3H]dCDP formed was measured (16Engström Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In some cases, we wanted to use similar buffer conditions for the enzyme assay as we use in GEMMA (GEMMA is not compatible with non-volatile salts). In these experiments KCl was excluded and 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.6, and 0.005% Tween 20 were added. The reduction of [8-14C]GDP (Moravek Biochemicals) was performed with 2.5 μg of R1 and 4 μg of R2 proteins under similar conditions as with CDP. However, 2 mm dTTP was then used in combination with variable amounts of ATP as effectors and the [14C]dGDP formed quantified after separation by boronate chromatography (17Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An alternative preincubation-based procedure was also sometimes used (8Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar): 5.5 μg of R1 and 4.48 μg of R2 protein were mixed with a buffer consisting of 2 mm dTTP, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm FeCl3, 10 mm KCl, 7 mm NaF, and variable amounts of ATP. After 5 min of preincubation at 25 °C, the assay was initiated by adding 100 μm [14C]GDP and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. GEMMA—The non-volatile salts present in the R1 protein solution were removed by gel filtration using a buffer containing ammonium acetate, pH 7.6, used at 20 mm for the R2 protein and 100 mm for the R1 protein. The protein samples were diluted to a concentration of 0.01–0.1 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.6, 0.005% Tween 20, and various amounts of nucleotides up to a maximum concentration of 150 μm. Magnesium was generally used at the same concentration as the nucleotides. The GEMMA system contained the following components: 3480 electrospray aerosol generator, 3080 electrostatic classifier, 3085 differential mobility analyzer, and 3025A ultrafine condensation particle counter (TSI Corp., Shoreview, MN). Most parameters were used as recommended by the manufacturer except those indicated in the figure legends. Every sample was scanned several times until the signal became stable. After obtaining a stable signal, the flow rate could be reduced by decreasing the capillary pressure drop from 3.7 to ∼1.5–2 psi. The spray cone was difficult to observe at this low pressure, and the stability of the spray was then monitored by the current reading. The proteins were scanned at the size range of 2.55–25.5 nm for 105 s/scan, and a particle density of 0.58 g/cm3 was used for the molecular mass calculations. The particle density was obtained from the average of 20 different standard proteins and was valid in the size range of 15–900 kDa. Mass Spectrometry—The nanospray mass spectrometry was run on a QTOF Ultima API machine (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK) using gold-coated borosilicate needles loaded with ∼5 μl of sample. The following parameters were used: 2-kV needle voltage, 25 °C source temperature, 100–200-V cone voltage, 100–200-V RF lens 1 settings, 5–10-eV collision energy, and 2200-V microchannel plate voltage. The machine was calibrated using a 2 mg/ml CsI solution in 50% isopropanol. The masses of protein complexes were measured from smoothed (2 × 200 channels by the Savitzky-Golay smoothing method) and centroided (100 channels, 80%) data by Masslynx software (Waters Corp.). Gel Filtration Experiments Show That the R1 Protein Forms Hexamers in the Presence of ATP/dATP—Analysis of protein complex formation by gel filtration was performed in the absence or presence of various allosteric effectors and an R1 protein concentration of 0.2–0.25 mg/ml (Fig. 1A). The concentration of effectors was high enough to saturate the specificity site (dTTP) or both allosteric sites (dATP/ATP). It was also needed to have the effectors present in the running buffer to avoid dissociation of the protein complexes (data not shown). In agreement with previous results (7Kashlan O.B. Scott C.P. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9Thelander L. Eriksson S. Åkerman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7426-7432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that dTTP induced the formation of R1 dimers and dATP or ATP induced the formation of a large R1 complex. By comparing the size of this complex to a standard of known globular proteins, the size was determined to be ∼544 kDa, which fits well with a hexamer. ATP and dATP had similar effects on oligomerization. Protein complex formation was efficient throughout a wide protein concentration range. Decreasing the protein concentration to 0.0125 mg/ml also demonstrated that dTTP induces dimer formation and ATP/dATP induces hexamer formation (Fig. 1B). R1 complex formation seemed independent of magnesium ions because R1 hexamers (0.05 mg/ml) were efficiently formed in the presence of 3 mm ATP and the absence of magnesium (Fig. 1B, bottom graph). Enzyme Activity and Allosteric Regulation Are Not Altered by the GEMMA Buffer—We wanted to confirm that GEMMA conditions do not affect enzyme activity. For GEMMA analysis we developed a buffer consisting of 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.6, and 0.005% Tween 20 to prevent nonspecific R1 aggregation. We measured the ribonucleotide reductase activity (CDP reduction) in the presence of the GEMMA buffer and normalized the results to the activity when using the standard Tris/KCl-containing buffer. The average of two measurements of the specific activity of the R1 protein was 100 ± 4% in the GEMMA buffer (the R2 protein was in excess). The addition of the inhibitory nucleotide effectors 50 μm dATP or 100 μm dGTP to the GEMMA buffer resulted in enzyme activities of 10 ± 2% and 12 ± 2%, respectively. Therefore, neither the specific activity of the R1 protein nor the allosteric regulation of the enzyme seemed to be altered when the GEMMA buffer was used. We also studied the effect of Mg2+ on the enzyme activity (GEMMA is limited to Mg2+ concentrations of 100 μm or below), and we found that the Mg2+ concentration needs to be at least equal to the total nucleotide concentration for maximal activity (data not shown). There was no advantage to increasing the amount of Mg2+ to higher than the total nucleotide concentration. GEMMA Experiments Show That the R1 Protein Is a Monomer and the R2 Protein Is a Dimer—The buffer used in GEMMA is different compared with the gel filtration buffer, and first we wanted to confirm that we get the same protein complexes in GEMMA as in gel filtration. The R1 and R2 subunits were analyzed separately in the absence of allosteric effectors (Fig. 2, A and B). The R1 protein shown in Fig. 2A gave a size of 91 ± 5 kDa, suggesting that it is a monomer (theoretical size 90 kDa). Three variants of the R2 protein were used in this study: the wild-type protein, a C-terminal-truncated protein, and an N-terminal-truncated protein. The three variants were analyzed separately by GEMMA, showing that they all formed dimers. The first two variants gave a size of 91 ± 5 kDa (theoretical size 2 × 45 kDa), whereas the N-terminal-truncated variant shown in Fig. 2B gave a size of 81 ± 5 kDa (theoretical size 2 × 38 kDa). GEMMA Experiments Show That ATP/dATP Always Induces R1 Hexamer Formation, Regardless of Which Effector Is Bound to the Specificity Site—We needed to optimize the GEMMA experiments because the method is not compatible with high concentrations of nucleotides (or other non-volatile salts). In Fig. 3A, the R1 protein was measured in the presence of 50 μm Mg-dATP (50 μm magnesium acetate and 50 μm dATP). The graph shows four peaks resulting from salt, R1 monomers, R1 dimers, and R1 oligomers. The estimated molecular mass of the oligomers was 510 ± 29 kDa, which fits well with the size of R1 hexamers. The salt peak comes from Mg-dATP clusters. A problem encountered during analysis was that the Mg-dATP clusters non-specifically bound to the R1 monomer, which had the appearance of being 101 kDa instead of 91 kDa. The effect of salts on the measured size of proteins is a known problem in GEMMA, especially for the measurement of small proteins (18Kaufman S.L. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2000; 406: 3-10Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The same mixture was re-analyzed at a reduced liquid flow rate (Fig. 3B), reducing the size of the primary droplets generated during the electrospray process. The reduced flow rate resulted in the R1 monomer being correctly measured. A drawback of the reduced flow rate is an ∼2-fold drop in sensitivity, but this was only a minor problem that could be compensated for by doubling the number of scans. The relative peak heights (and areas) of the monomer and dimer were fairly stable between similar samples, whereas the absolute values in particles/cm3 varied depending on factors such as the flow rate used. All subsequent measurements of the R1 and R2 proteins were performed at reduced flow rate. There is good agreement between the results from GEMMA (Fig. 3) and the gel filtration experiments (Fig. 1). In the absence of allosteric effectors, the R1 protein was mainly a monomer (Fig. 3C), and after addition of a specificity site effector (50 μm Mg-dGTP) the protein formed dimers (Fig. 3D). The addition of effectors that bound to both allosteric sites (e.g. dATP) induced R1 hexamer formation (Fig. 3B). The concentration of dGTP or dATP in these experiments (50 μm) was enough to saturate the specificity site (dGTP) or both allosteric sites (dATP) as judged from filter binding studies (19Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and enzyme activity measurements (5Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2948-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reducing the flow rate improved the molecular mass measurements in most cases, except for the R1 dimer (theoretical size 180 kDa), which was measured as 173 kDa in the absence of salt (Fig. 3C) and 193 kDa in the presence of nucleotides (Fig. 3, A and B, D–F). We also analyzed R1 complex formation in the presence of various combinations of allosteric effectors. To investigate which R1 complexes were formed when the activity site was occupied with dATP and the specificity site occupied by another effector (e.g. dGTP), GEMMA analysis of the R1 protein was carried out in the presence of 50 μm dGTP and 1 μm dATP (Fig. 3E). The dATP concentration was low enough to allow dGTP to fully occupy the specificity site (19Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Also, in this case R1 hexamers were formed. Finally, it was investigated which complexes are formed in the presence of 100 μm ATP. In this case some hexamers were also formed, but the oligomerization process was not so efficient at this low concentration of ATP (data not shown). The efficiency of hexamer formation was increased when 100 μm ATP was used in combination with a specificity site effector (50 μm dGTP) (Fig. 3F). Similar beneficial effects on effector affinities have been previously observed and were explained by cross-talk between the allosteric sites (19Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We conclude that when ATP or dATP binds to the activity site, hexamer formation is induced. The good agreement between GEMMA data and gel filtration experiments indicates that the GEMMA buffer is appropriate for the measurement of R1 complexes. Mass Spectrometry Analysis Confirms That the Oligomers Induced by dATP (or ATP) Are Hexamers—To confirm that the dATP-induced complex is a hexamer, the R1 protein was analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (a more accurate method than GEMMA or gel filtration). The mass spectrum of the R1 protein in the presence of 20 μm Mg-dATP and 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, gave a series of peaks centered on 5000 m/z units (coming from the R1 monomer; Fig. 4A). A similar series of peaks was also formed in the absence of dATP, and the size was then determined to be 90.2 kDa (data not shown). A second series of peaks centered on 12,000 m/z units was only formed in the presence of dATP, but the resolution was too low to assign the mass of the corresponding protein complex. To increase the resolution, the magnesium was excluded and the ammonium acetate buffer was replaced with 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 7.5 (Fig. 4B). The mass of the corresponding protein complex was calculated to be 549.75 ± 0.07 kDa, which fits well with a hexamer (theoretical size 547.7 kDa, including 2 dATP/polypeptide). The deviation between theoretical and experimental values can be explained by the extra mass coming from nonspecific binding of dATP and other salts. GEMMA Analysis Shows That the R1 Hexamers Are Able to Interact with the R2 Protein, Forming an α6β2 Complex—To investigate whether the various R1 complexes were able to bind the R2 dimer, R1 and R2 protein complexes in the presence of dTTP were measured by GEMMA (Fig. 5A). Compared with the results when using each protein alone, a new peak with a mass of ∼266 kDa was observed, corresponding to an α2β2 structure (theoretical size 270 kDa). The peaks at 91 and 193 kDa could not be assigned. To assign the unknown complexes in Fig. 5A, a truncated variant of the R2 protein was used. This protein lacks 60 N-terminal amino acids encoding a recognition site for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in mitosis (20Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), but it has a similar specific activity as the wild-type protein in enzyme assays (data not shown). The first complex (now shifted to 81 kDa) was mainly from R2 dimers (2 × 38 kDa), and the second peak (shifted to 173 kDa) was from αβ2 complexes (Fig. 5B). To prove that the observed interactions were real, a second truncated variant of the R2 protein was used. This protein lacks 7 amino acids in the C terminus that had previously been shown to be crucial for R1-R2 interaction (21Lycksell P.-O. Ingemarson R. Davis R. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). With this variant of the R2 protein there was no R1-R2 interaction and only the β2 and α2 peaks were observed (Fig. 5C). The effect of dATP on R1-R2 interaction using the same set of R2 protein variants was studied (Fig. 5, D–F). The R1 hexamer shifted in size to 633 ± 35 kDa when the R2 protein or the N-terminal-deleted variant of the R2 protein was added (Fig. 5, D and E) but not with the R2 protein, which was unable to interact with the R1 protein (Fig. 5F). The size of this complex corresponded to an α6β2 structure (theoretical size 637/623 kDa (including 2 dATP/polypeptide), depending on whether wild type- or N-terminal-truncated R2 protein is used). Surprisingly, only one R2 dimer was bound to the R1 hexamer. The mass of this complex was not increased when the concentration of the R2 protein was doubled (data not shown). It appears that binding of one R2 dimer prevents the binding of a second R2 dimer. Correlation between α6β2 Complex Formation and Stimulation of Enzyme Activity by ATP—Partially based on enzyme activity assays, the mammalian ribonucleotide reductase was recently suggested to contain three allosteric sites (7Kashlan O.B. Scott C.P. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); at low concentrations ATP acts as a pure specificity site regulator but inhibits the reaction when used at high enough concentrations to bind to the activity site (∼1 mm). When ATP is used above 1 mm, it also binds to the hexamerization site (h-site) and the enzyme activity increases again. A dip in the enzyme activity at 1 mm ATP was thus taken as evidence for the existence of an additional regulatory site (the h-site). The dip in the enzyme activity was claimed to be even more pronounced if the enzyme were preincubated with allosteric effectors before the substrate was added (8Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To investigate how many allosteric sites ribonucleotide reductase contains, the reduction of GDP in the presence of a constant amount of dTTP (2 mm) and an increasing concentration of ATP was measured (Fig. 6A). Three different assay conditions were used, the standard protocol (KCl buffer, no preincubation), GEMMA conditions (KCl was replaced by 20 mm ammonium acetate), and the published preincubation-based procedure (8Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The concentration of dTTP (2 mm) was sufficient to exclude ATP binding to the specificity site (19Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), simplifying interpretation of the results. As seen in the figure, the enzyme is active with only dTTP as effector and this activity increases gradually with the ATP concentration. Already at a concentration of 100 μm ATP, we had almost 2-fold stimulation of enzyme activity. Similar results were obtained if we reduced the nucleotide and magnesium concentrations to fit the requirements for GEMMA analysis (Fig. 6A, inset). Also in this case we had an almost 2-fold stimulation at 100 μm ATP. We did not observe any dip in the enzyme activity at any of the three assay conditions (Fig. 6A). The effect of ATP on enzyme activity can thus be explained by activity site binding, and there is no support for the existence of an additional regulatory site. The stimulation of enzyme activity is nearly complete at 0.5 mm ATP (Fig. 6A). Higher concentrations of ATP were needed to saturate the enzyme activity in the absence of dTTP using CDP as substrate (Fig. 6B). Maximal stimulation was then obtained at ∼1 mm ATP. It is possible that the affinity of ATP to the activity site is increased in the presence of a specificity site effector (e.g. dTTP). Similar effects have been observed previously and were explained by cross-talk between the allosteric sites (19Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Finally, parallel GEMMA experiments and enzyme assays were carried out using ammonium acetate buffer with GDP as substrate and dTTP as effector. A nearly 2-fold stimulation of enzyme activity was observed when 100 μm ATP was added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 6A, inset). The GEMMA analysis showed that in the presence of dTTP, the R1 protein exclusively formed dimers that interacted with the R2 protein in an α2β2 complex (Fig. 6C), whereas in the presence of ATP and dTTP there were approximately equal amounts of R1 dimers and hexamers, which interacted with the R2 protein to form α2β2 and α6β2 complexes (Fig. 6D). We conclude that there is a correlation between α6β2 complex formation and stimulation of enzyme activity. GEMMA is a quick method allowing high-throughput analysis. Therefore, we have been able to study the influence of many factors on R1-R2 complex formation. R1 complex formation mainly comes from the allosteric effectors, although the strength of the interactions could be modulated by substrates, reducing agents, the pH value, and salt concentrations. Effectors that only bind to the specificity site always induced the formation of R1 dimers, whereas effectors that bind to both allosteric sites always induced R1 hexamers. Because there is no effector known that only binds to the activity site, it is not known if it is enough to bind to this site for the formation of hexamers or if both allosteric sites need to be occupied. The GEMMA results showed for the first time that all forms of the R1 protein bind the R2 protein. The R1-R2 interaction occurred throughout a wide concentration range of the R1 (0.02–0.1 mg/ml) and R2 (0.01–0.05 mg/ml) proteins (we have only shown the GEMMA results performed with 0.1 mg/ml R1 and 0.05 mg/ml R2 protein). As a comparison, the cellular concentrations of the R1 and R2 proteins in logarithmically growing cells have been estimated to be 0.05 and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively (10Håkansson P. Hofer A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7834-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Based on dynamic light scattering experiments and enzyme activity assays, Cooperman′s laboratory recently proposed a new model for the allosteric regulation of ribonucleotide reductase (7Kashlan O.B. Scott C.P. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This model involves three allosteric sites: the specificity site, the activity site, and a third hypothetical site termed the hexamerization site (h-site). Accordingly, dATP or ATP binds to the activity site, inducing the formation of inactive R1 tetramers. However, when high concentrations of ATP are used the h-site is also occupied, inducing the formation of R1 hexamers that can form a hyperactive complex together with the R2 protein. Our data do not support the proposed model because we could not find support for the h-site in enzymatic assays and because we did not observe any dATP/ATP-induced tetramers. ATP or dATP always induced the formation of R1 hexamers as measured by three independent methods. However, under certain conditions we observed that ATP also induced non-specific aggregation/precipitation leading to clogging of GEMMA capillaries and altered gel filtration peaks (reduced peak intensities/changed peak positions (data not shown)). The aggregation/precipitation problems could be limited by either using a high concentration of ATP (10 mm) or by leaving out magnesium from the buffer. It cannot be excluded that nonspecific aggregation/precipitation might have influenced the average protein size in dynamic light scattering experiments and caused enzyme inhibition at certain concentrations of ATP in previous analyses. The mammalian ribonucleotide reductase belongs to the class Ia family of ribonucleotide reductases that contains enzymes from eukaryotes, some bacteria, and some viruses (1Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). We do not know whether the newly discovered α6β2 complex is unique to mammals or whether other class Ia enzymes are able to form this complex as well. Previous results from the E. coli class Ia ribonucleotide reductase are in conflict with each other. It was reported that the E. coli class Ia enzyme is able to form a large protein complex in the presence of dATP (22Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 218: 4591-4601Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), but a more recent study failed to detect this complex (24Larsson Birgander P. Bug S. Kasrayan A. Dahlroth S.-L. Westman M. Gordon E. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14997-15003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To clarify this issue, we have started to study the E. coli enzyme as well as other representatives of the class Ia family with the GEMMA technique. The GEMMA, mass spectrometry, and gel filtration results are all in perfect agreement with previous results that the specificity site effectors stimulate R1 dimer formation (7Kashlan O.B. Scott C.P. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9Thelander L. Eriksson S. Åkerman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7426-7432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that these dimers can interact with the R2 protein, forming an α2β2 structure (2Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the ATP concentration in the cell has been estimated to be 3 ± 1.7 mm (25Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar), and at this concentration the activity sites will also be at least partially occupied. In our enzyme activity assays, ATP had a saturating effect in this concentration range, and in our gel filtration experiments the hexamers dominated when using 3 mm ATP. Therefore, the α6β2 complex is likely the major form of ribonucleotide reductase in vivo. We have also shown that there is a correlation between hexamer formation and ATP activation. Perhaps the hexamer has a higher activity than the dimer, but the binding of dATP can block this activity by inducing a small change in the protein structure. The next logical step in our project will be to try to localize the interaction surfaces in the hexamer and see whether we can make a mutant R1 protein that is unable to form hexamers. The study of this mutant will hopefully give further insight into the activity site regulation of ribonucleotide reductases. We thank Lars Thelander, Margareta Thelander, and Vladimir Domkin at Umeå University for providing the plasmids encoding the wild-type and mutant forms of the R1 and R2 proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2019267635,"We recently identified the gold compound aurothiomalate (ATM) as a potent inhibitor of the Phox and Bem1p (PB1)-PB1 domain interaction between protein kinase C (PKC) ι and the adaptor molecule Par6. ATM also blocks oncogenic PKCι signaling and the transformed growth of human lung cancer cells. Here we demonstrate that ATM is a highly selective inhibitor of PB1-PB1 domain interactions between PKCι and the two adaptors Par6 and p62. ATM has no appreciable inhibitory effect on other PB1-PB1 domain interactions, including p62-p62, p62-NBR1, and MEKK3-MEK5 interactions. ATM can form thio-gold adducts with cysteine residues on target proteins. Interestingly, PKCι (and PKCζ) contains a unique cysteine residue, Cys-69, within its PB1 domain that is not present in other PB1 domain containing proteins. Cys-69 resides within the OPR, PC, and AID motif of PKCι at the binding interface between PKCι and Par6 where it interacts with Arg-28 on Par6. Molecular modeling predicts formation of a cysteinyl-aurothiomalate adduct at Cys-69 that protrudes into the binding cleft normally occupied by Par6, providing a plausible structural explanation for ATM inhibition. Mutation of Cys-69 of PKCι to isoleucine or valine, residues frequently found at this position in other PB1 domains, has little or no effect on the affinity of PKCι for Par6 but confers resistance to ATM-mediated inhibition of Par6 binding. Expression of the PKCι C69I mutant in human non-small cell lung cancer cells confers resistance to the inhibitory effects of ATM on transformed growth. We conclude that ATM inhibits cellular transformation by selectively targeting Cys-69 within the PB1 domain of PKCι. We recently identified the gold compound aurothiomalate (ATM) as a potent inhibitor of the Phox and Bem1p (PB1)-PB1 domain interaction between protein kinase C (PKC) ι and the adaptor molecule Par6. ATM also blocks oncogenic PKCι signaling and the transformed growth of human lung cancer cells. Here we demonstrate that ATM is a highly selective inhibitor of PB1-PB1 domain interactions between PKCι and the two adaptors Par6 and p62. ATM has no appreciable inhibitory effect on other PB1-PB1 domain interactions, including p62-p62, p62-NBR1, and MEKK3-MEK5 interactions. ATM can form thio-gold adducts with cysteine residues on target proteins. Interestingly, PKCι (and PKCζ) contains a unique cysteine residue, Cys-69, within its PB1 domain that is not present in other PB1 domain containing proteins. Cys-69 resides within the OPR, PC, and AID motif of PKCι at the binding interface between PKCι and Par6 where it interacts with Arg-28 on Par6. Molecular modeling predicts formation of a cysteinyl-aurothiomalate adduct at Cys-69 that protrudes into the binding cleft normally occupied by Par6, providing a plausible structural explanation for ATM inhibition. Mutation of Cys-69 of PKCι to isoleucine or valine, residues frequently found at this position in other PB1 domains, has little or no effect on the affinity of PKCι for Par6 but confers resistance to ATM-mediated inhibition of Par6 binding. Expression of the PKCι C69I mutant in human non-small cell lung cancer cells confers resistance to the inhibitory effects of ATM on transformed growth. We conclude that ATM inhibits cellular transformation by selectively targeting Cys-69 within the PB1 domain of PKCι. Aurothiomalate inhibits transformed growth by targeting the PB1 domain of atypical protein kinase Cι.

PKCι expression is elevated in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and primary tumors, and PKCι expression predicts poor clinical outcome (1Regala R.P. Weems C. Jamieson L. Khoor A. Edell E.S. Lohse C.M. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8905-8911Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). PKCι expression is driven in a significant subset of NSCLC tumors by tumor-specific amplification of the PKCι gene (PRKCI) that resides on chromosome 3q26 (1Regala R.P. Weems C. Jamieson L. Khoor A. Edell E.S. Lohse C.M. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8905-8911Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the most frequent site of tumor-specific amplification in NSCLC cancers (2Balsara B.R.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2290-2294PubMed Google Scholar). PKCι stimulates a pro-oncogenic PKCι/Par6 → Rac1 → Mek1/2 → Erk1/2 signaling pathway that is required for transformed growth of NSCLC cells in vitro and tumor formation in vivo (4Regala R.P. Weems C.

Expression of either a kinase-deficient PKCι mutant (kdPKCι) or the Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain of PKCι inhibits oncogenic PKCι signaling and blocks transformed growth, indicating the involvement of both PKCι kinase activity and PB1 domain interactions in oncogenic PKCι signaling (4Regala R.P.

PKCι-mediated transformation requires activation of the downstream effector, Rac1, which is coupled to PKCι through PB1-PB1 domain interactions between PKCι and the adaptor molecule Par6 (4Regala R.P.

Our studies provided the first compelling evidence that PKCι is an oncogene in human cancer (1Regala R.P. Weems C. Jamieson L. Khoor A. Edell E.S. Lohse C.M. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8905-8911Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Subsequent reports have indicated that PKCι serves as both a prognostic marker (5Eder A.M. Sui X. Rosen D.G. Nolden L.K.

Liang S. Barchetti A. Giannakakis A. Cadungog M.G. O'Brien-Jenkins A. Massobrio M. Roby K.F. Katsaros D. Gimotty P. Butzow R. Weber B.L. Coukos G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4627-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether PKCι mediates transformed growth of ovarian cancer cells by a similar signaling mechanism. Based on our results, we reasoned that a small molecule chemical inhibitor of the PKCι-Par6 interaction would have potential as a chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of NSCLC. Therefore, we designed and implemented a novel high throughput drug screening assay based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer to identify compounds that can disrupt the PB1-PB1 domain-mediated binding of PKCι to Par6 (7Stallings-Mann M. Jamieson L. Regala R.P. Weems C. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We used our assay to screen a commercial library consisting of a diverse set of chemical compounds approved for human use. From our screen, we identified several known drugs that potently inhibit PKCι-Par6 interactions in vitro (7Stallings-Mann M. Jamieson L. Regala R.P. Weems C. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Two of the most potent inhibitors identified were the gold compounds aurothiomalate (ATM) and aurothioglucose (ATG). These compounds inhibit the PB1-PB1 domain interaction between PKCι and Par6 in a dose-dependent fashion and exhibit potent anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo in pre-clinical models of NSCLC (7Stallings-Mann M. Jamieson L. Regala R.P. Weems C. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because ATM is currently approved for clinical use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, this compound is a particularly attractive candidate for clinical development as a novel, mechanism-based anti-tumor agent and is the focus of this study. The PB1 domain is a highly conserved protein-protein interaction domain that is present on a family of signaling proteins. Unique interaction codes exist that specify the ability of PB1 domains to interact with each other (8Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H. Kristiansen K. Overvatn A. Michaelsen E. Bjorkoy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to determine whether ATM exhibits selectivity toward specific PB1 domain interactions or is a broad specificity inhibitor of PB1-PB1 domain interactions. We also sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism of ATM-mediated inhibition of PB1-PB1 domain interactions and transformed growth. Here we demonstrate that ATM exhibits high selectivity for PB1-PB1 domain interactions involving PKCι. Furthermore, by using a combination of sequence alignments, the crystallographic structure of the PKCι-Par6 complex, and site-directed mutagenesis, we identify the molecular mechanism by which ATM selectively inhibits the PB1 domain of PKCι. Finally, we demonstrate that ATM inhibits transformed growth by selectively targeting the PB1 domain of PKCι. Plasmids, Mutagenesis, and Recombinant Proteins—Plasmids used in this work are listed in supplemental Table I. The T7 promoter containing mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3-V5-PKCι (Invitrogen), pDestmyc-PKCλ, pDestHA-p62, pDestHA-p62 R21A, pDestmyc-p62 R21A, and pDestmyc-MEK5 have all been described previously (8Lamark T.

The vectors pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences; used for bacterial expression of GST), pDest15 (Invitrogen; Gateway destination vector for expression of GST-tagged fusion proteins), and pDestmyc have also been described previously (8Lamark T.

The Gateway entry vector pENTR1Aend (stop codons in all three reading frames) was made by inserting a linker (TCGAGGCCTAGGTAGCTAAGCTTCCCGGGCTAG) into pENTR1A (Invitrogen) cut with XhoI and XbaI. pENTR-MEKK3-(1-215) was made by subcloning a 1.05-kb NheI-BamHI fragment (BamHI site treated with T4 DNA polymerase) from pENTR-MEKK3 into pENTR1Aend cut with NheI and StuI. To make pENTR-NBR1-(2-248), pENTR2B (Invitrogen) was first cut with EcoRI and religated. The product was then cut with XhoI and XbaI (XbaI site treated with Klenow polymerase) and an XhoI-NdeI fragment (NdeI site treated with Klenow polymerase) subcloned from pcDNA3-HA-NBR1. The following plasmids were made by Gateway LR reactions: pDestmyc-PKCλ (pENTR-PKCλ + pDestmyc); pDestmyc-NBR1-(2-248) (pENTR-NBR1-(2-248) + pDestmyc); pDest15-p62 D69A (pENTR-p62 D69A + pDest15); and pDest15-MEKK3-(1-215) (pENTR-MEKK3-(1-215) + pDest15). The full-length biotinylated human Par6α cDNA-PinPoint Xa-3 and PKCι-(1-113)/YFP-N1-pRSET plasmids were constructed previously (7Stallings-Mann M. Jamieson L. Regala R.P. Weems C. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The PKCι mutants, C69I and C69V, were constructed in the PKCι-(1-113)/YFP-N1-pRSET using INSULT (9Erdogan E. Jones R.J. Matzlin P. Hanna M.H. Smith S.M. Salerno J.C. Mol. Biotechnol. 2005; 30: 21-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the first step of INSULT, one strand of the plasmid carrying the mutation was amplified using the following mutagenic oligonucleotides: C69I, 5′-P-GGAAGGAGACCCGATCACAGTATCATCTCAGTTGG-3′ and C69V, 5′-P-GGAAGGAGACCCGGTCACAGTATCATCTCAGTTGG-3′. In the second step, closed double-stranded mutant DNA was produced using the generic oligonucleotide, 5′-P-GGTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGCGGG-3′. All constructs were sequenced to confirm their identities. Expression and Purification of Proteins—Cmr plasmids, carrying the αB crystallin gene, were co-transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) along with Par6α cDNA-PinPoint Xa-3. Transformants were selected on LB plates containing 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Biotinylated human Par6 protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) grown in modified Terrific Broth (10Martasek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) at 22 °C (220 rpm), and cells were harvested 48 h after A600 reached ∼0.8. Biotinylated human Par6 protein was isolated from inclusion bodies using B-PER Reagent (Pierce) as described previously (7Stallings-Mann M. Jamieson L. Regala R.P. Weems C. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cmr plasmids carrying the αA crystallin gene and PKCι-(1-113)/YFP-N1-pRSET were co-transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and transformants were grown in LB containing 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 22 °C (220 rpm), and cells were harvested 48 h after A600 reached ∼0.8. Soluble His-tagged PKCι/YFP proteins were isolated using the B-PER His6 purification kit (Pierce) and dialyzed against Tris buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 135 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). In some experiments, Histagged PKCι/YFP protein was incubated with 100 μm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) at room temperature for 20 min and dialyzed against Tris buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 135 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 2 m urea prior to performing PKCι-Par6 binding as described previously (7Stallings-Mann M.

GST Pulldown Assays of PB1-PB1 Domain Interactions—GST fusion proteins were produced in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) and purified from cell extracts using glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). 35S-Labeled Myc-tagged proteins were co-transcribed/translated in vitro using the TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). For each GST pulldown experiment, 5-10 μl of in vitro translated Myc-tagged protein was diluted in 100 μl of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA) containing 1 tablet per 10 ml of Complete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The diluted in vitro translated proteins were preincubated with empty glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads and the indicated amount of ATM for 30 min on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads with immobilized GST fusion protein were added to the supernatant, and the samples were incubated for 60 min on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with NETN buffer containing the indicated amount of ATM and boiled in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were resolved in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was Coomassie-stained and vacuum-dried. 35S-Labeled proteins were detected on a bio-imaging analyzer (BAS-5000, Fujifilm). Quantification of gel band intensities was done using the program Image Gauge (Fujifilm). Immunoprecipitation of in Vitro Translated p62—pDestHA-p62 or pDestHA-p62R21A (500 ng) was transcribed/translated in vitro in a total volume of 25 μl using the TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Before transcription/translation in vitro, the indicated amount of ATM was added to the reticulocyte lysate. Expression of p62 from these vectors results in two products, HA-tagged p62 and untagged p62. After transcription/translation in vitro, 20 μl of the extract was diluted in 200 μl of ice-cold NETN buffer (with protease inhibitor mixture and the indicated amount of ATM). The samples were preincubated with a slurry of CL-4B Protein A-Sepharose beads in NETN buffer for 20 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel and then incubated with 0.1 μg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) for 1 h and for another 30 min in the presence of bovine serum albumin-saturated Protein A-Sepharose beads in NETN buffer. The beads were washed five times in NETN containing the indicated amounts of ATM or ATG. The beads were resuspended in 15 μl of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel load buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and 35S-labeled proteins were detected on a bio-imaging analyzer (BAS-5000, Fujifilm). PKCι-Par6 Binding Assay—Recombinant biotinylated human Par6 protein was covalently bounded to streptavidin-coated 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) by incubation at room temperature for 2 h as described previously (7Stallings-Mann M. Jamieson L. Regala R.P. Weems C. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Plates were washed twice with PBS/Tween 20 and then once with PBS. After washing, purified PKCι/YFP was added to each well along with ATM to achieve the desired final concentration as indicated in the figures, and binding was determined as described previously (7Stallings-Mann M. Jamieson L. Regala R.P. Weems C. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Wells were then washed with PBS two times, and bound PKCι/YFP was determined by measuring fluorescence intensity using a Typhoon 9410 imager (GE Healthcare). Binding analysis of wild-type and C69I and C69V PKCι mutants was performed in the presence of increasing amounts of PKCι protein as indicated in the figures. Scatchard analysis was used to calculate apparent Kd values for binding to Par6. Cell Transfections, PKCι Kinase Assay, and Transformation Assays—Human H1703 NSCLC and HEK 293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in adherent culture as described previously (4Regala R.P.

H1703 cells were stably infected with pBabe retroviruses containing either FLAG-tagged wild-type human PKCι, a human PKCι C69I mutant, or empty pBabe virus using puromycin selection as described previously (1Regala R.P.

H1703 cell transfectants were plated in soft agar in the absence or presence of ATM at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends and assessed for soft agar colony formation as described previously (1Regala R.P.

Plates were analyzed at each ATM concentration, and results are expressed as the mean colony number ± S.E. (n = 5). Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling studies were conducted on a Linux work station with the software package Gold (13Verdonk M.L. Cole J.C. Hartshorn M.J. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). The initial three-dimensional structures were obtained using SYBYL version 7.0 (Tripos Inc.) and energy-minimized by using the MAXIMIN routine of SYBYL. ATM Is a Highly Selective Inhibitor of PB1-PB1 Domain Interactions Involving PKCι—We recently identified the gold compounds ATM and ATG as inhibitors of the PB1-PB1 domain interaction between PKCι and the adaptor molecule Par6 (7Stallings-Mann M. Jamieson L. Regala R.P. Weems C. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that not only did these compounds inhibit PKCι-Par6 interactions, but they also inhibited PKCι signaling to Rac1, a downstream effector of the PKCι-Par6 complex and blocked transformed growth of NSCLC cells in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo (7Stallings-Mann M. Jamieson L. Regala R.P. Weems C. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our results suggested that the inhibitory effects of ATM on transformed growth are mediated through disruption of PB1-PB1 domain interactions. However, it remained to be determined whether the growth inhibitory effects of ATM were mediated exclusively through inhibition of PKCι-dependent PB1-PB1 domain interactions or whether ATM inhibits other PB1-PB1 domain interactions that might contribute to its cellular effects. To address this question, we developed highly specific pulldown assays for major PB1-PB1 domain interactions using GST fusion proteins and 35S-labeled binding partners essentially as described previously (8Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H. Kristiansen K. Overvatn A. Michaelsen E. Bjorkoy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). ATM potently inhibits PKCι binding to Par6 (7Stallings-Mann M. Jamieson L. Regala R.P. Weems C. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); therefore, we first assessed whether it would also inhibit PKCι binding to p62 (Fig. 1). For this purpose, we used GST pulldown assays to analyze binding between 35S-labeled human PKCι and GST-tagged p62. Because p62 can polymerize via PB1-PB1 domain interactions involving both the OPCA and basic cluster motifs within its PB1 domain (8Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H. Kristiansen K. Overvatn A. Michaelsen E. Bjorkoy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 14Wilson M.I. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Quinn M.T. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we utilized a mutant p62 in which Asp-69 within the OPCA motif was mutated to alanine (p62D69A). The D69A mutation makes p62 incapable of forming homopolymers or homodimers but preserves its ability to bind to PKCι via its basic cluster motif (8Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H. Kristiansen K. Overvatn A. Michaelsen E. Bjorkoy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In the absence of ATM, PKCι binds GST-p62 and is recovered in the GST pulldown (Fig. 1A). However, in the presence of ATM, significant inhibition of PKCι binding is observed (Fig. 1, A and B). The mouse homolog of PKCι, PKCλ, also binds p62 via the conserved OPCA motif. Binding of PKCλ to p62 is similarly inhibited in the presence of ATM (Fig. 1C). Because ATM inhibits binding of PKCι to Par6 (7Stallings-Mann M. Jamieson L. Regala R.P. Weems C. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), our present results suggest that ATM may target either the OPCA domain of PKCι or the basic cluster domains of both Par6 and p62. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we next assessed the ability of ATM to inhibit PB1-PB1 domain interactions involving p62. For this purpose, we developed two separate assays to measure p62 dimerization and polymerization, respectively. To measure p62 dimerization, we used a pulldown assay in which we incubate GST-p62D69A immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads with in vitro translated, 35S-labeled p62R21A. These two mutants are incapable of self-dimerization because of the disruption of the OPCA motif (D69A) and basic cluster motif (R21A), respectively (8Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H. Kristiansen K. Overvatn A. Michaelsen E. Bjorkoy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, when combined they are capable of dimerizing with each other (Fig. 2A), making this a highly specific assay for p62 dimerization. Interestingly, addition of ATM had no appreciable effect on the ability of these proteins to dimerize (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar results were obtained in a related p62 polymerization assay in which wild-type p62 and HA-tagged wild-type p62 were incubated together followed by pulldown using protein A beads and an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2C). In this latter assay, the presence of untagged p62 in the precipitate indicates p62 polymerization. In the presence of an inhibitor, the amount of untagged p62 will decrease relative to the amount of HA-tagged p62 precipitated. However, no demonstrable change in polymerization was seen in the presence of ATM (Fig. 2C). As a control, HA-tagged p62R21A and untagged p62R21A mutants were incubated together. As expected, these mutants are incapable of polymerizing, and as a result, no untagged p62 is found in the precipitate (Fig. 2C). Our results indicate that ATM does not significantly inhibit p62-p62 interactions. Thus it is unlikely that ATM targets either the basic cluster or OPCA motif of p62, but rather our data are consistent with an effect of ATM on the OPCA motif of PKCι. To further probe the selectivity of ATM, we assessed the ability of ATM to inhibit PB1-PB1 domain interactions between p62 and NBR1. In this interaction, p62 uses a basic cluster motif to bind to the OPCA motif of NBR1 (8Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H. Kristiansen K. Overvatn A. Michaelsen E. Bjorkoy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Using a pulldown binding assay analogous in design to our p62 dimerization assay, we observed efficient binding and pulldown of the 35S-labeled NBR1 protein with GST-p62D69A (Fig. 3A). Just as was seen with p62 dimerization, addition of ATM to the binding assay had no demonstrable inhibitory effect on p62-NBR1 binding (Fig. 3, A and B). Finally, we assessed whether ATM could inhibit the binding of yet another PB1-PB1 domain interaction. In this case, we designed a specific pulldown assay to measure the binding of MEKK3 to MEK5 similar to that used in our other binding assays (Fig. 4A). ATM had no inhibitory effect on MEKK3-MEK5 binding (Fig. 4, A and B). Taken together, our results demonstrate that ATM exhibits remarkable selectivity for PB1-PB1 domain interactions involving PKCι, suggesting that ATM targets the PB1 domain of PKCι. Given these observations, we next investigated the molecular mechanism underlying ATM selectivity.FIGURE 4The PB1 domain interaction between MEKK3 and MEK5 is not affected by ATM. 35S-Labeled MEK5 produced by in vitro translation was analyzed for binding to GST-MEKK3-(1-215) in GST pulldown assays (A) and the results quantitated (B) essentially as outlined in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Potential Role of Cysteine Residues in PKCι-Par6 Binding and ATM Action—Despite extensive clinical use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the mechanism of action of gold compounds such as ATM is largely unknown.

Collagen XII, a multidomain protein with a small collagenous region, interacts with fibrillar collagens through its C-terminal region. However, no interactions to other extracellular proteins have been identified involving the non-collagenous N-terminal NC3 domain. To further elucidate the components of protein complexes present close to collagen fibrils, different extracellular matrix proteins were tested for interaction in a solid phase assay. Binding to the NC3 domain of collagen XII was found for the avian homologue of tenascin-X that in humans is linked to Ehlers-Danlos disease. The binding was further characterized by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and supported by immunohistochemical co-localization in chick and mouse tissue. On the ultrastructural level, detection of collagen XII and tenascin-X by immunogold labeling confirmed this finding.

The integrity of extracellular matrix is maintained by supramolecular networks assembled by a large variety of matrix macromolecules. Among those is the group of 28 different collagen types so far described in the literature. Collagens are further subdivided into several families reflecting their assembly-forming properties (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends. Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). As a common feature, fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACITs) 2The abbreviations used are: FACIT, fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple helices; Col, collagenous domain; NC, non-collagenous domain; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TN, tenascin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. comprise at least two collagenous domains interrupted by non-collagenous domains. Collagen XII is a member of the FACIT subfamily, and its three chains are encoded by a single gene. The two collagenous domains (Col1 and Col2) are interrupted and flanked by three non-collagenous domains (NC1-NC3), of which the large trimeric NC3 domain contains up to 90% of the molecular mass of collagen XII. The N-terminal NC3 part of each polypeptide chain consists of two to four von Willebrand factor type A domains, several fibronectin type III repeats, and a thrombospondin N-terminal domain (2Gordon M.K. Gerecke D.R. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6040-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3Yamagata M. Yamada K.M. Yamada S.S. Shinomura T. Tanaka H. Nishida Y. Obara M. Kimata K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The size of the protein is variable due to two alternative splice sites located at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the collagen XII mRNA. Especially remarkable is the splicing mechanism that produces mRNA encoding for NC3 domains that differ ∼100 kDa in mass, denoted as XIIA for the large form and as XIIB for the small form (4Koch M. Bernasconi C. Chiquet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Trueb J. Trueb B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 97-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The other alternative splicing generates two NC1 domains of similar size, termed -1 or -2, which results in the nomenclature of the four different collagen XII isoforms: XIIA-1, XIIA-2, XIIB-1 and XIIB-2 (for overview of the domain structure please refer to Fig. 2A) (6Kania A.M.

The isoforms differ in their histological and developmental distribution: the large forms XIIA-1 and XIIA-2 are preferably expressed during embryonic stages, whereas the expression of the small forms persists in adult tissues (7Bohme K. Li Y. Oh P.S. Olsen B.R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the small isoform XIIB-1 predominantly occurs in ligaments and tendons, whereas the XIIB-2 shows a more widespread expression (6Kania A.M. Reichenberger E. Baur S.T. Karimbux N.Y. Taylor R.W. Olsen B.R. Nishimura I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22053-22059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The isoforms also differ in their biochemical properties. The large forms contain an additional heparin binding site in the 7th fibronectin type III domain; in addition, covalently linked glycosaminoglycan chains are attached to them (4Koch M. Bernasconi C. Chiquet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Koch M. Bohrmann B. Matthison M. Hagios C. Trueb B. Chiquet M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas alternative splicing in the NC1 domain leads to an additional heparin binding site in the XIIA/B-1 form (9Aubert-Foucher E. Goldschmidt D. Jaquinod M. Mazzorana M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Collagen XII also interacts with decorin (10Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Boutillon M.M. Hulmes D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and is a component of collagen I-containing fibrils (8Koch M.

J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Tenascins are a distinct family of extracellular matrix proteins with four members in vertebrates (TN-C, TN-R, TN-W, and TN-X). They all exhibit a similar domain structure with an N-terminal oligomerization domain, a series of epidermal growth factor modules followed by several fibronectin type III domains and a large globular fibrinogen-related domain (for review see Ref. 12Jones F.S. Jones P.L. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 235-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Mammalian tenascin-X can associate with collagen I-containing fibrils through binding to the glycosaminoglycan chains of the small fibril-associated proteoglycan, decorin (13Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Boutillon M.M. Garrone R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Lethias C. Elefteriou F. Parsiegla G. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, cells in culture adhere to tenascin-X through interaction with integrin receptors (16Elefteriou F. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. Lethias C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The first indication for the function of tenascin-X in vivo was derived from the finding that human patients lacking the protein develop a connective tissue disorder, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (17Burch G.H. Gong Y. Liu W. Dettman R.W. Curry C.J. Smith L. Miller W.L. Bristow J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Today, the suggestion is widely accepted that tenascin-X is a regulator of collagen deposition in vivo, consistent with a reduced density of collagen fibrils in the skin of tenascin-X null mice (18Mao J.R. Taylor G. Dean W.B. Wagner D.R. Afzal V. Lotz J.C. Rubin E.M. Bristow J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism behind these findings still remains elusive (19Bristow J. Carey W. Egging D. Schalkwijk J. Am. J. Med. Genet. C Semin. Med. Genet. 2005; 139: 24-30Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A closely related gene and protein have been identified in the chick (20Hagios C. Brown-Luedi M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Hagios C. Koch M. Spring J. Chiquet M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The avian protein is most homologous to mammalian tenascin-X in its C-terminal region and shares with it a serine/proline-rich domain but has smaller subunits with only one (instead of 18) complete epidermal growth factor repeats and with fibronectin type III modules not related in sequence to any other avian or vertebrate tenascin. At the time of discovery, these considerable differences justified a new name, tenascin-Y, for the avian protein (20Hagios C. Brown-Luedi M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Hagios C. Koch M. Spring J. Chiquet M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Fluck M. Tunc-Civelek V. Chiquet M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3583-3591PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent phylogenetic studies of the tenascin gene family in chordates revealed that chick tenascin-Y belongs to the tenascin-X branch and that it is more closely related to mammalian than to Xenopus tenascin-X. 3Tucker, R. P., Drabikowski, K., Hess, J. F., Ferralli, J., Chiquet-Ehrismann, R., and Adams, J. C., BMC Evol. Biol., in press. The human tenascin-X gene is located in the human MHCIII locus on chromosome 6q21.3, a locus that, according to comparative mapping information corresponds to chicken chromosome 16 (23Groenen M.A. Cheng H.H. Bumstead N. Benkel B.F. Briles W.E. Burke T. Burt D.W. Crittenden L.B. Dodgson J. Hillel J. Lamont S. de Leon A.P. Soller M. Takahashi H. Vignal A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar). At this location, the chicken tenascin-Xgene is in immediate synteny with the complement C4, TAP1, TAP2, and MHC-II-like genes that represent orthologues of the genes present in the human MHCIII locus next to the human tenascin-X gene, proving a common evolutionary origin for this genomic region. 3Tucker, R. P., Drabikowski, K., Hess, J. F., Ferralli, J., Chiquet-Ehrismann, R., and Adams, J. C., BMC Evol. Biol., in press. For these reasons, it is justified to abandon the former name tenascin-Y and to call the protein “avian tenascin-X” instead. For collagen XII, the function as a modulator of tissue biomechanical properties by bridging collagen I-containing fibrils to other extracellular matrix components has been suggested (24Nishiyama T. McDonough A.M. Bruns R.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28193-28199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Shaw L.M. Olsen B.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 191-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Our findings reported here support this concept. Avian tenascin-X interacts with the NC3 domain of avian collagen XII, thereby establishing a mechanical coherence of banded collagen fibrils with their extrafibrillar environment. Antibodies and Antibody Production—Antibodies against mouse collagen XII were produced as described previously (26Veit G. Kobbe B. Keene D.R. Paulsson M. Koch M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3494-3504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA coding for the fibronectin type III domains 14-18 of the mouse collagen XII was amplified by PCR using primers that introduced a NheI restriction site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end (M193, forward, CACGCTAGCAGAGGACTGTCAAGAAACATCC and M194, reverse, TTGGGATCCTTAGGTCTGTTCTTTGATGGGGACA). The cDNA was cloned into a modified pPET (EMD Biosciences) vector carrying a His6 tag with a thrombin cleavage site. Upon transformation with the recombinant plasmid, Escherichia coli cells (Bl21; EMD Biosciences) were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for 16 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested (15 min, 5000 × g, 4 °C) and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, containing 7 m urea. The bacteria were sonicated, followed by removal of insoluble cell debris by centrifugation (30 min, 20000 × g, 4 °C). After 2-fold dilution with H2O the supernatant was applied to a nickel-chelating Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with binding buffer containing 40-80 mm imidazole. Following removal of urea by dialysis, thrombin cleavage was performed overnight at room temperature (5 mm CaCl2, 1 unit/mg thrombin; Sigma-Aldrich), and the cleaved His6 tag was removed by passing the solution again over a nickel-chelating Sepharose column. The recombinant protein was used to immunize a rabbit from which the antiserum was purified by affinity chromatography on a column with antigen coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The specific antibody, termed KR33, was eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 m triethylamine, pH 11.5, and the eluate neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Polyclonal rabbit antibody against chick collagen XII (522) (8Koch M. Bohrmann B. Matthison M. Hagios C. Trueb B. Chiquet M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), polyclonal chick antibody against mouse tenascin-X (KX3), polyclonal rabbit antibody against chick tenascin-X (KX8) (21Hagios C.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and polyclonal rabbit antibody against chick tenascin-C (TN474) (28Chiquet M. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1926-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) have been characterized before. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Determination of Protein Concentration—SDS-polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) was performed as described by Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). 1.3 μg of protein/lane was separated on 3-10% SDSPAGE gradient gels under either reducing or non-reducing conditions and visualized with a silver staining kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined using a binicotinic acid assay kit (Uptima) following the manufacturer's instructions. Solid Phase Binding Assay—The production of recombinant avian tenascin-X (formerly tenascin-Y) has been described previously (20Hagios C. Brown-Luedi M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Tenascin-C and collagen XII were purified from chick embryo fibroblast-conditioned medium by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography following established procedures (8Koch M. Bohrmann B. Matthison M. Hagios C. Trueb B. Chiquet M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Chiquet M. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To calculate the molar concentrations of the proteins utilized for titration measurements, the molecular masses of the monomeric forms of avian tenascin-X (205 kDa), avian tenascin-C (200 kDa), and the mean value of the small and large splice variants of avian collagen XII, estimating a molar ratio of 1:1 (274.5 kDa), were used. Purified proteins were diluted in TBS, pH 7.4, and 5 μg/ml (250 ng/well) were coated onto 96-well plates (Nunc Maxisorb) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBS, unspecific binding sites were blocked at room temperature with 5% skimmed milk powder in TBS for 2 h. Ligands were diluted in blocking buffer to concentrations from 0.03 to 300 nm for the tenascins or 0.023 to 230 nm for collagen XII and incubated for 1.5 h. For competition experiments the competitor was added to the ligand solution before incubation. After removing excess ligand by washing twice with TBS, bound ligand was fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 10 min. Bound ligands were detected with specific affinity-purified antibodies, rabbit against chick collagen XII (522), chick tenascin-X (KX8), or chick tenascin-C (TN474) followed by swine anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled IgG (Dako Cytomation). For enzymatic reaction, wells were incubated with 50 μl of 0.25 mm tetramethylbenzidine and 0.005% (v/v) H2O2 in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 50 ml/well 2.5 m H2SO4, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Labsystems Multiscan MS). For analysis, measurements of wells treated equally, except for the addition of ligand, were subtracted as blank values. All buffers contained 2 mm CaCl2. Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was performed using a Biacore 2000 (BIAcore AB) system. Avian tenascin-X, fulllength avian collagen XII, and the purified collagen XII NC3 domain were coupled in 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.7, with a flow rate of 5 μl/min to a CM5 chip. The chip was previously activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride. After coupling the required amount of protein (∼1000 response units), unbound reactive groups were saturated with 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5. Experiments were carried out using different concentrations (3, 10, 30, and 100 nm) of avian tenascin-X and full-length collagen XII diluted in running buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.005% P20). The analyte was passed over the sensor chip with a constant flow rate of 30 μl/min for 120 s, and dissociation was measured over 350 s. Fittings of the data, overlay plots, and calculation of KD values were done with BIAevaluation software 3.2. Collagenase Digestion—To generate avian collagen XII molecules consisting only of the trimeric NC3 domain, i.e. lacking their collagenous parts as well as the NC1 and NC2 domains, the protein was subjected to collagenase digestion. A solution of 77 nm collagen XII was incubated with 100 units/ml highly purified collagenase (CLSPA; Worthington Biochemicals) in TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at37°C. Collagenase-treated collagen XII was immediately used for SDS-PAGE and solid phase binding assay. Alternatively, the NC3 domain was separated from collagenase and digestion fragments by running the sample over a gel filtration column (Superose 12 HR 10/30; GE Healthcare). Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed on cryosections of embryonic chick (E14.5) and newborn mouse (P1). The frozen sections were preincubated in ice-cold methanol for 2 min, blocked for 1 h with 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20, and incubated with the primary antibodies against collagen XII (KR33 or 522) overnight at 4 °C followed by Cy™3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako Cytomation). For co-staining of mouse sections a chick antibody against tenascin-X (KX3) was used followed by Cy™2-conjugated donkey anti-chick IgG (Dako Cytomation). For co-staining of chick sections, the 522 antibody was biotinylated using Biotin-X-NHS (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-staining was accomplished using sequential incubation, first with KX8 antibody for detection of tenascin-X followed by incubation with Cy™2-conjugated affinity-purified Fab fragment goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova), and second with biotinylated 522 antibody followed by Cy™3-conjugated anti-biotin antibody (Sigma). Stained sections were analyzed, and pictures were taken with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SL) using two lasers in parallel with the excitation wavelengths 488 nm for Cy™2 and 543 nm for Cy™3. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Fragments of native collagen fibrils were isolated from newborn mouse skin, placed on grids, immunostained with KR33, KX3, and colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibodies, and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy as previously described (31Kassner A. Hansen U. Miosge N. Reinhardt D.P. Aigner T. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Bruckner P. Grassel S. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Pre-Embedding immunogold labeling of mouse skin was carried out as previously described (32Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 15-day embryonic chick skin was harvested fresh, rinsed briefly in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM), and then immersed in antibody diluted 1:5 in DMEM overnight at 4 °C. The tissues were rinsed for several hours in DMEM and then immersed in appropriate 10-nm gold secondary conjugate (GAR G10; Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. Following an extensive rinse in DMEM the tissues were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde/1.5% paraformaldehyde with 0.05% tannic acid, rinsed, and then post-fixed in 1% OsO4. Following dehydration in ethanol, the tissues were embedded in Spurr's epoxy and 80-nm-thick sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a Philips 410 TEM. Adult mouse skin was rinsed extensively in DMEM and then immersed overnight in antibody diluted 1:10 in DMEM. Following a 4-h rinse in DMEM, tissues were immersed in appropriate 1-nm gold secondary conjugate (Amersham Biosciences GAR G1 for type XII antibody or Aurion GACh ultrasmall for TN-X) and then rinsed extensively in DMEM followed by a brief rinse in phosphate-buffered saline. Gold particles were then enhanced using the Nanoprobes GEEM gold enhance kit. Briefly, tissue in buffer is chilled on ice, incubated on ice for 15 min in complete enhance solution, and then warmed quickly to 25 °C and incubated for 5 min. Tissue is rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. After gold enhancement, the tissue is fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde/1.5% paraformaldehyde containing 0.05% tannic acid and then dehydrated, embedded and stained, and observed as described above. Interaction between Collagen XII and Tenascin-X—In a solid phase binding screen for possible interaction partners of avian collagen XII, we discovered avian tenascin-X as a possible candidate. Titration experiments showed saturable binding using either collagen XII or tenascin-X as the soluble ligand. Because of its similar domain structure (33Jones F.S. Hoffman S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1905-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), tenascin-C was used as a negative control (Fig. 1, A and B). To calculate the molar protein concentrations for the titration measurements, the molecular masses of the monomeric forms of avian tenascin-X (205 kDa) and a mean value of the small and large splice variants of avian collagen XII, estimating a molar ratio of 1:1, (274.5 kDa) were used. In the titration experiment, half-maximal saturation was reached at a concentration of soluble collagen XII of 2.5 ± 0.5 × 10-8 m. When tenascin-X was the soluble binding partner, half-maximal saturation was found at 1.5 ± 0.5 × 10-8 m, i.e. at a closely comparable concentration. The small discrepancy might originate from different avidities of the oligomeric forms of the two proteins. To validate the results, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was performed and the associations and dissociations of the obtained binding curves were analyzed in a Langmuir 1:1 binding model (Fig. 1, C and D). Apparent KD values for collagen XII as soluble interaction partner of 1.34 × 10-8 m and for soluble tenascin-X of 6.44 × 10-9 m were calculated, which is in good agreement with the solid phase binding data. The purity of the isolated proteins was checked by reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B). Avian tenascin-X occurs in trimeric and hexameric forms (20Hagios C. Brown-Luedi M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) containing at least three or six binding sites for collagen XII. Upon reduction the oligomeric forms dissociate into monomers. A similar pattern can be observed for tenascin-C, whose splice variants result in three bands on reducing gels (28Chiquet M. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1926-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 33Jones F.S. Hoffman S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Collagen XII can exist as homo- or heterotrimeric combinations of the small and the large splice variants, which represent the four major bands on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Upon reduction, the polypeptide pattern is complex but entirely explainable (8Koch M. Bohrmann B. Matthison M. Hagios C. Trueb B. Chiquet M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The trimeric forms dissociate into large and small monomers and into various non-reducible dimers. Additional bands on reducing SDS-PAGE are due to glycosaminoglycan side chains attached to the large isoform of collagen XII (4Koch M. Bernasconi C. Chiquet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The NC3 Domain of Collagen XII Contains the Binding Site for Tenascin-X—Collagen XII interacts with collagen I-containing fibrils through its collagenous domain (8Koch M. Bohrmann B. Matthison M. Hagios C. Trueb B. Chiquet M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Additionally, two interaction sites for heparin are known, one at the very end of a C-terminal splice variant (6Kania A.M. Reichenberger E. Baur S.T. Karimbux N.Y. Taylor R.W. Olsen B.R. Nishimura I.

Hagios C. Trueb B. Chiquet M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To exclude the heparin binding sites being involved in binding of collagen XII to tenascin-X, competition experiments were performed. Even in 130-fold molar excess, heparin had no effect on the binding of collagen XII to tenascin-X (Fig. 3A). To study the contribution of the collagenous region (consisting of domains NC1, Col1, NC2, and Col2) of collagen XII in the binding process, collagenase digestion was performed. Treatment of collagen XII with highly purified bacterial collagenase simplified the complex pattern in reducing SDS-PAGE to two major bands that represent the NC3 domains of the small and large splice variants of the protein (Fig. 3B). The NC3 domain was purified via gel filtration chromatography, and because the cysteines are not removed the NC3 remains a trimeric molecule. (Fig. 3B, lane 4). In solid phase binding assays, collagenase-treated collagen XII showed a similar interaction with immobilized tenascin-X compared with the intact protein (Fig. 3C). To confirm those results, the purified NC3 domains were measured in surface resonance spectroscopy interaction experiments; from the obtained curves the apparent KD for the binding of soluble tenascin-X to the fragment is 5.90 × 10-9 m (Fig. 3D), i.e. very similar to intact collagen XII (cf. Fig. 1D). Taken together these results indicate that the binding site(s) for tenascin-X reside within the NC3 domain of collagen XII. Partial Co-distribution of Collagen XII with Tenascin-X in Chick Skin and Muscle—The extracellular matrix of skeletal muscle is arranged in three levels: the individual muscle fibers are surrounded by the endomysium, bundles of muscle fibers are encased by the perimysium, and the complete muscle is embedded in the epimysium. It is known that chick tenascin-X is a component of muscle extracellular matrix and is primarily situated in the epimysium and perimysium of developing muscles, whereas tendons are negative for tenascin-X, both at the mRNA and the protein level (20Hagios C.

The protein and the mRNA are located in the epimysium, perimysium, and unlike tenascin-X, also in tendon (8Koch M. Bohrmann B. Matthison M. Hagios C. Trueb B. Chiquet M. J.

https://openalex.org/W2131719944,Spring-summer winds from the south move moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Plains. Rainfall in the growing season sustains prairie grasses that keep large dunes in the Nebraska Sand Hills immobile. Longitudinal dunes built during the Medieval Warm Period (800 to 1000 years before the present) record the last major period of sand mobility. These dunes are oriented NW-SE and are composed of cross-strata with bipolar dip directions. The trend and structure of the dunes record a drought that was initiated and sustained by a historically unprecedented shift of spring-summer atmospheric circulation over the Plains: Moist southerly flow was replaced by dry southwesterly flow.
https://openalex.org/W1966879697,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a novel metabolite of NADP that has now been established as a Ca2+ messenger in many cellular systems. Its synthesis is catalyzed by multifunctional enzymes, CD38 and ADP-ribosyl cyclase (cyclase). The degradation pathway for NAADP is unknown and no enzyme that can specifically hydrolyze it has yet been identified. Here we show that CD38 can, in fact, hydrolyze NAADP to ADP-ribose 2′-phosphate. This activity was low at neutrality but greatly increased at acidic pH. This novel pH dependence suggests that the hydrolysis is determined by acidic residues at the active site. X-ray crystallography of the complex of CD38 with one of its substrates, NMN, showed that the nicotinamide moiety was in close contact with Glu146 at 3.27 Å and Asp155 at 2.52 Å. Changing Glu146 to uncharged Gly and Ala, and Asp155 to Gln and Asn, by site-directed mutagenesis indeed eliminated the strong pH dependence. Changing Asp155 to Glu, in contrast, preserved the dependence. The specificity of the two acidic residues was further demonstrated by changing the adjacent Asp147 to Val, which had minimal effect on the pH dependence. Crystallography confirmed that Asp147 was situated and directed away from the bound substrate. Synthesis of NAADP catalyzed by CD38 is known to have strong preference for acidic pH, suggesting that Glu146 and Asp155 are also critical determinants. This was shown to be case by mutagensis. Likewise, using similar approaches, Glu98 of the cyclase, which is equivalent to Glu146 in CD38, was found to be responsible for controlling the pH dependence of NAADP synthesis by the cyclase.

As a second messenger, NAADP levels in cells are expected to respond to physiological stimuli. Indeed, agonists and stimuli are shown to activate rapid and transient changes in NAADP levels (7Yamasaki M. Thomas J.M. Churchill G.C. Garnham C. Lewis A.M. Cancela J.-M. Patel S. Galione A. Curr.

As a nucleotide, NAADP is sensitive to degradative enzymes, such as nucleotide phosphodiesterase or alkaline phosphatase (31Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Gee K.R. Kestner T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4172-4178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these general enzymes are responsible for its degradation in cells is not known. NAADP is insensitive to regular NADase (32Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and so far, no enzyme has yet been identified that can specifically hydrolyze NAADP. Here we show, unexpectedly, that CD38 is able to specifically hydrolyze NAADP to ADP-ribose 2′-phosphate (ADPRP). The reaction shows a dramatic pH dependence. Using x-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified two acidic residues at the active site of CD38 to be responsible for controlling both the hydrolysis and synthesis of NAADP. These results are found to be applicable for the Aplysia cyclase as well. Expression of the Human CD38 and Its Mutants in Yeast— The Pichia expression vector pPICZaA (Invitrogen) was used and the construct consisted of cloning the catalytic domain of either the wild type or mutant human CD38 in frame with the yeast mating α-factor signal sequence, as described previously (27Munshi C.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar), were deleted and the catalytic domain started at Arg45. The tightly controlled alcohol oxidase promotor AOX1 was used to regulate the expression of the construct. Following a 24-h growth phase in YPD (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose) medium, protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5% methanol. The supernatants were harvested 72 h after methanol induction. The expressed protein was soluble and was purified from the culture medium in a single step using phenyl-Sepharose chromatography as described previously for proteins expressed with this system (35Munshi C.B.

The purified proteins were divided into aliquots and stored at -20 °C. Repeated freeze/thaw cycles caused protein aggregation and decreased enzymatic activities. The mutants of CD38 were prepared by site directed mutagenesis as described (28Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Enzyme Assays—The NAADPase reaction was measured by incubating wild type or mutant CD38 (10 μg/ml, 1-60 min) at room temperature with 0.5 mm of NAADP, 9 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and at pH 4 to 8. The pH buffers used were 25 mm sodium acetate (pH 4-6) or 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7 or pH 8. The base-exchange reaction was assayed using 1 mm NADP and 25 mm nicotinic acid at various pH values, adjusted with Tris base. The total volume of the reaction mixture was 100 μl, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 150 mm HCl. The protein was removed by filtration using Immobilon-P plates (Millipore). The samples were neutralized with Tris base and diluted with water to a final volume of 1.1 ml, and 0.8 ml of the mixture was injected onto an AG MP-1 column (10 × 120 mm). The reaction products were analyzed by HPLC (BioCad). AG MP-1 was obtained from Bio-Rad. The elution was performed using a gradient of trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 5 ml/min as described previously (27Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

The tissues were homogenized in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7, with 15 strokes in a Potter/Elvehjem homogenizer (1:10, w/v). The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. After removing the supernatant, the pellet was reconstituted in buffer and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm. The wash procedure was repeated and the membranes were used in the assay for NAADPase activity. Brain membranes (3.5 mg/ml) were incubated withh 2 mm NAADP, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, for 10.5 and 26 h at 30 °C. Spleen membranes (1.88 mg/ml) were incubated with 0.6 mm NAADP, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, for 24 h at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by dilution (1/10) in 0.5% SDS and the products analyzed by HPLC. Crystallography—The complex of CD38 with NMN was obtained by soaking crystals of an inactive mutant of CD38, E226G, with 20 mm NMN for 1 min at 4 °C. We have previously shown that changing the catalytic glutamate residue of CD38 at position 226 to Gly inactivates all its enzymatic activities (28Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D.

Soaking solution was prepared by mixing NMN, crystallization mother liquor, and 30% glycerol. Glycerol was required to prevent formation of ice at low temperature. The soaked crystal was then frozen to liquid nitrogen temperature and stored under liquid nitrogen before data collection. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source A1 station under cryoprotection at 100 K with a fixed wavelength of 0.967 Å. A total of 360 images with an oscillation angle of 1° were collected using a Quantum Q-210 CCD detector. The complete data set was processed using the program package DENZO/SCALEPACK (37Otwinowski Z.

Analyses by HPLC showed that NAADP was converted to nicotinic acid that eluted at 4.7 min before NAADP, and ADPRP, which eluted 4.3 min afterward (inset of Fig. 1). The identification of ADPRP was confirmed by its conversion to authentic ADP-ribose (ADPR) after treatment with alkaline phosphatase (10Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of NAADP was low at pH 7 but was stimulated 5-fold at pH 4, resulting in more than 80% of NAADP being hydrolyzed after 1 h of incubation. The value for Km was 104 ± 10 μm and for Vmax was 3,555 ± 155 nmol/mg/min, as determined by double-reciprocal plots. As shown in Fig. 2, the pH profile of the hydrolysis exhibits a maximum at pH 5.FIGURE 2The pH profiles of the NADPase and NAADPase reactions. CD38 was incubated with NADP or NAADP at the indicated pH values. The reaction products were analyzed by HPLC. The reaction rates at various pH were normalized and compared with the maximal values at pH 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This strong dependence on pH suggests that the protonation of the nicotinic acid group of the substrate is important. Indeed, when NADP was used as a substrate instead, the hydrolysis activity was essentially independent of pH as shown in Fig. 2. NADP and NAADP have the same structure except that an uncharged amide group replaces the carboxyl group of the nicotinic acid moiety and the two differ by only one mass unit (2Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the nicotinic acid moiety of NAADP is bound close to some acidic residues at the active site of CD38. At neutral pH, the electrostatic repulsion between them would reduce substrate binding and consequently the reaction rate. X-ray crystallography was used to determine substrate binding to the active site of CD38. Although we have recently solved the crystal structure of CD38 (26Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Munshi C. Lee H.C. Hao Q. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1331-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), co-crystallizing CD38 with a substrate was not feasible because of its catalytic activities converting the substrate to product during the process. Instead, we first crystallized an inactive mutant of CD38, E226G, that had the catalytic glutamate residue at position 226 changed to glycine (28Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21566-21571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 35Munshi C.B. Lee H.C. Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12169-12173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A single E226G crystal was then soaked in a solution containing the substrate, NMN, to allow its diffusion into the active site. The structure of the complex was solved to the resolution of 1.95 Å (Table 2). Fig. 3 shows that NMN is bound inside a pocket near the middle of the protein. Detailed structural analyses of the NMN complex and complexes of other substrates will be presented elsewhere. However, what is clear from Fig. 3 is that the amide group of the NMN is in close contact with two acidic residues, 3.27 Å from Glu146 and 2.52 Å from Asp155. Assuming that NAADP binds to the active site in a similar fashion, the carboxyl group of the nicotinic acid moiety would be repelled by the two acidic residues, reducing substrate binding and reaction rate. Changing these acidic residues to uncharged ones should eliminate the electrostatic repulsion and increase the reaction rate at neutral or alkaline pH when the nicotinic acid group is charged. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change Glu146 to either glycine or alanine. We have previously shown that mutations of Glu146 greatly increase the NAD cyclization activity of CD38 that produces cADPR (36Graeff R. Munshi C. Aarhus R. Johns M. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12169-12173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Consistently, the mutants not only hydrolyzed NAADP but also cyclized it to cyclic 2′-phospho-ADP-ribose, similar to that seen with the cyclase (described later). Both reactions released nicotinic acid that was measured by HPLC and grouped together as “NAADPase” activity (Fig. 4). The pH profiles of the mutants are shown in Fig. 4 in comparison with that of the wild type (WT), which has no NAADPase activity at pH 8. The activity was restored to 80.8 ± 4.3% of the maximal activity at pH 5 (listed in Table 1) when the Glu146 was changed to glycine and to 65.1 ± 0.9% when it is changed to alanine. Similarly, changing Asp155 to Gln restored the activity to 63.9 ± 10.0% of the maximum. This effect of residue change is specific since changing Asp155 to another acidic residue, Glu, produced only minimal enhancement (12.9 ± 0.3%) at pH 8 and the overall pH profile remained essentially the same as the wild type. Catalytically, the Aplysia cyclase is very similar to CD38, except that when NAD is used as substrate, the cyclase cyclizes it to cADPR while CD38 mainly hydrolyzes it to ADPR, with only a small amount of cADPR produced as well (22Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 24Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C.

Commun. 1993; 191: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is thus of interest to determine whether the cyclase can also use NAADP as a substrate. The HPLC chromatograph in the inset of Fig. 5 shows that incubation of the cyclase with NAADP resulted in its conversion to cyclic ADP-ribose-2′phosphate (cADPRP), which eluted 2.5 min after NAADP and 1.8 min earlier than ADPRP (inset in Fig. 1). In the process, nicotinic acid was released also. The identification of cADPRP was done by treatment with alkaline phosphatase, converting it to authentic cADPR as previously described (10Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Similar to the NAADPase activity of CD38, the cyclization of NAADP by the cyclase exhibited strong pH dependence and was measurable only when it was more acidic than pH 6 (Fig. 5). The value for Km was 61 ± 19 μm, and Vmax was 6,315 ± 555 nmol/mg/min, as determined by double-reciprocal plots at pH 4. We have previously shown by crystallography that nicotinamide binds to the active site of the cyclase and is close to Glu98 (27Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that is homologous to Glu146 in CD38. Consistent with that observed in CD38, mutating Glu98 to glycine shifted the pH profile of the NAADP cyclization reaction toward alkaline by two pH units (Fig. 5). The rather dramatic pH dependence of NAADP hydrolysis and cyclization is reminiscent of the synthesis of NAADP via the base-exchange reaction catalyzed by both CD38 and the cyclase (10Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). It is thus of interest to determine whether mutations described above have similar effects on the exchange reaction. This is the case as shown in Fig. 6. The pH profile of the base-exchange reaction catalyzed by the mutant, E146G, became essentially flat as compared with that of the wild type (upper panel, Fig. 6). Similarly, changing Glu98 of the cyclase to glycine increased the exchange reaction at pH 6 from undetectable in the wild type to 83.4 ± 3.2% of the maximal activity (lower panel, Fig. 6). The upper panel of Fig. 7 summarizes the results of the NAAD-Pase activity of CD38. At pH 8, the wild type has no measurable activity. Changing Glu146 to uncharged alanine or glycine, or Asp155 to glutamine or aspargine, increased the activity to 50-80% of the maximal activity of the respective mutants at acidic pH (see Table 1). Changing Asp155 to another acidic residue (Glu) produced minimal enhancement. The enhancement is specific for the two acidic residues, since changing the aspartate residue, Asp147, immediately adjacent to Glu146, to a valine produced only minimal activity enhancement, not more than that observed in D155E. This is consistent with the crystal structure of the CD38-NMN complex (Fig. 3). Even though Asp147 is adjacent to Glu146, it is directed far away from the bound NMN. It is not expected to exert significant electrostatic repulsion to the nicotinic acid moiety of NAADP. Thus changing Asp147 to the uncharged valine had very little effect in enhancing the NAADP hydrolysis reaction. The cyclase also can use NAADP as substrate, but instead of hydrolyzing it to ADPRP, the cyclase cyclizes it to cADPRP. The critical acidic residue in this case is Glu98. The lower panel of Fig. 7 shows that the same critical acidic residues at the active site of CD38 and the cyclase just described are also important in controlling the NAADP synthesis via the base-exchange reaction. To show that the NAADPase is physiologically relevant and can be detected in tissue extracts, mouse brain and spleen membrane fractions were incubated with NAADP and the products analyzed by HPLC. The NAADPase activities were similar in both tissues and measured to be 0.50 ± 0.04 nmol/mg/h for brain and 0.41 ± 0.04 nmol/mg/h for spleen. The results presented in this study are consistent with the following catalytic model. NAADP first binds to the active site of CD38 with the nicotinic acid close to Glu146 and Asp155. In the case of the cyclase, the binding is close to Glu98, which is homologous to Glu146 in CD38. The homologous residue for Asp155 is an uncharged residue, Asn107. The electrostatic repulsion between the acidic residues and the nicotinic acid moiety dictates that the substrate binding can only occur at acidic pH when either the residues or the nicotinic acid are neutralized, consistent with the fact that the NAADP reactions can occur only in acidic pH. The crystal structures of CD38 complexed with NMN shown in this study (Fig. 3) and the cyclase complexes with nicotinamide published previously (27Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) are consistent with this placement of NAADP in the active sites. This substrate placement is quite different from that seen in CD157, another homolog of CD38. In that case, the nicotinamide ring of NMN is mainly positioned by a Trp instead and interacts with other residues only indirectly via bound water (41Yamamoto-Katayama S. Ariyoshi M. Ishihara K. Hirano T. Jingami H. Morikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It should be noted that although CD157 is homologous to CD38, it has only a small fraction of catalytic activities of CD38. It thus appears that the close interactions of the substrate with the acidic residues seen in CD38 and the cyclase may in fact be important in positioning the substrate for the efficient action of the catalytic residues. The next step of the reaction is the cleavage of the C1′-N1 glycosidic linkage by the catalytic action of Glu226 in CD38 or Glu179 in the cyclase, forming an intermediate. In the process the nicotinic acid ring is released. Nucleophilic attack of the intermediate by water then results in hydrolysis of NAADP and the formation of ADPRP. A similar catalytic process can be proposed for the synthesis of NAADP via the base-exchange reaction. In this case the substrate is NADP, whose binding to the active site is not repelled by the acidic residues because the amide group of the substrate is uncharged. The lack of pH dependence of the NADPase reaction (cf. Fig. 2) is consistent with this notion. Similar to that proposed above, catalytic release of the nicotinamide ring from the bound NADP and subsequent attack of the intermediate by water results in hydrolysis of NADP (NADPase reaction, Fig. 2). On the other hand, if an efficient nucleophile, such as nicotinic acid, is present, its preferential attack on the intermediate will lead to the base-exchange reaction and the formation of NAADP. As shown by the cyclase-nicotinamide complex (27Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), nicotinic acid may well be binding close to the same critical acidic residues in the active sites during the base-exchange reaction. That changing these residues has effects essentially the same on both the exchange and the hydrolysis reactions is consistent with the scheme. The rather unusual acidic dependence of the synthesis and hydrolysis of NAADP can have physiological relevance. It has previously been proposed that the NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway may be specifically associated with the acidic organelles of the endocytic process (3Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 42Lee H.C. Chem. Immunol. 2000; 75: 39-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recent results have now shown that NAADP indeed specifically targets the lysosomal Ca2+ stores in both invertebrate and mammalian cells (43Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Sandip Patel S. Antony Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 44Yamasaki M. Masgrau R. Morgan A.J. Churchill G.C. Patel S.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54319-54326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As a messenger molecule, NAADP must be removed efficiently once its signaling function is completed. Exactly how this is accomplished in cells remains to be elucidated. Based on the sensitivity of the 2′-phosphate of NAADP to phosphatases, we have proposed that the general presence of these hydrolytic enzymes in cells should ensure efficient degradation of NAADP (3Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Indeed, brain membranes are able to dephosphorylate NAADP to NAAD (46Berridge G. Cramer R. Galione A. Patel S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by CD38 described here represents the second reaction ever shown to be able to degrade NAADP. Both reactions can be detected in brain membrane fractions with the phosphatase reaction being about 4-fold higher that the hydrolysis reaction (data not shown). The NAADPase of CD38 is, however, much more specific for NAADP and related molecules. More importantly, that CD38 is capable of both synthesizing and hydrolyzing NAADP would ensure that the degradation pathway is at the precise location of NAADP synthesis, facilating its efficient removal. It is thus likely that the NAADPase of CD38 would play a more dominant role as a physiological removal system for NAADP. CD38 is clearly a unique protein. Its novelty lies not on the fact that it is a multi-functional enzyme capable of using different substrates and producing distinct products but that all these products have been shown to be have novel physiological functions. CD38 cyclizes NAD to produce cADPR, a second messenger for mobilizing the Ca2+ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (reviewed in Refs. 3Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 4Lee H.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 317-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 5Lee H.C.

It also hydrolyzes NAD to ADPR, which, together with cADPR, has recently been shown to be a modulator of the TRPM2 channels (47Kolisek M. Beck A. Fleig A. Penner R. Mol.

At acidic pH, CD38 can produce NAADP, another Ca2+ messenger specifically targeting the lysosomal Ca2+ stores. Perhaps, most surprising of all, is the fact that CD38 is the only known enzyme that can hydrolyze cADPR to ADPR (24Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M.

The base-exchange reaction catalyzed by CD38 has now been shown to be more versatile than just producing NAADP; it can in fact produce a series of adenylic dinucleotides from cADPR and adenine, which are regulators of cell proliferation (51Basile G. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Fattorusso E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, when CD38 is expressed on the lymphocyte surface, it also functions as an antigen and when ligated by antibodies produces a myriad of functional effects on the cells (reviewed in Refs. 11Malavasi F.

Understanding the mechanisms and controlling factors of the multitude of functions of CD38 is clearly relevant, and by unraveling the mechanism behind the dramatic pH dependence, this study represents a step toward that goal."
https://openalex.org/W2029005444,"Sphingolipids are ubiquitous and essential components of eukaryotic membranes, particularly the plasma membrane. The biosynthetic pathway for the formation of these lipid species is conserved up to the formation of sphinganine. However, a divergence is apparent in the synthesis of complex sphingolipids. In animal cells, ceramide is a substrate for sphingomyelin (SM) production via the enzyme SM synthase. In contrast, fungi utilize phytoceramide in the synthesis of inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) catalyzed by IPC synthase. Because of the absence of a mammalian equivalent, this essential enzyme represents an attractive target for anti-fungal compounds. In common with the fungi, the kinetoplastid protozoa (and higher plants) synthesize IPC rather than SM. However, orthologues of the gene believed to encode the fungal IPC synthase (AUR1) are not readily identified in the complete genome data bases of these species. By utilizing bioinformatic and functional genetic approaches, we have isolated a functional orthologue of AUR1 in the kinetoplastids, causative agents of a range of important human diseases. Expression of this gene in a mammalian cell line led to the synthesis of an IPC-like species, strongly indicating that IPC synthase activity is reconstituted. Furthermore, the gene product can be specifically inhibited by an anti-fungal-targeting IPC synthase. We propose that the kinetoplastid AUR1 functional orthologue encodes an enzyme that defines a new class of protozoan sphingolipid synthase. The identification and characterization of the protozoan IPC synthase, an enzyme with no mammalian equivalent, will raise the possibility of developing anti-protozoal drugs with minimal toxic side affects."

Breast Cancer Res. 2004; 6: R616-R628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be critical to cell motility in some cell types (10Denker S.P. Barber D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). NHE1 is composed of two domains as follows: an N-terminal membrane domain of ∼500 amino acids and a C-terminal regulatory domain of ∼315 amino acids (1Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 6Fliegel L. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2001; 96: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The N-terminal membrane domain is responsible for ion movement and has 12 transmembrane segments and 3 membrane-associated segments (11Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). How this domain binds and transports Na+ ions and protons is only recently starting to be elucidated. We have recently analyzed TM IV of the NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger. We showed that prolines 167 and 168 are critical to NHE1 function, targeting, and expression (12Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Phe161 was shown to be a pore-lining residue critical to transport, and the structure of TM IV was shown to be atypical of TM proteins, being composed of one region of β-turns, an extended middle region, including Pro167–Pro168, plus a region helical in character (13Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Li X. Liu Y. Cheng F.J. Lindhout D.A. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17863-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). TM VII is believed to extend from amino acids Ile251 to Leu273 (11Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). We have shown that TM VII is critical for the function of the NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger (14Murtazina B. Booth B.J. Bullis B.L. Singh D.N. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that Glu262 and Asp267 of TM VII are critical for activity. Residues with a similar position and charge in TM VI were not important. The E262Q and D267N mutations destroyed activity of the NHE, whereas replacement with the other negatively charged amino acid retained, but modified, exchanger activity. In this study, we examine both structural and functional aspects of TM VII of the NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger. We use alanine scanning and insertional mutagenesis (15Fleming K.G. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14340-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Braun P. Persson B. Kaback H.R. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29566-29571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to determine amino acid residues critical for Na+/H+ exchanger activity, expression, targeting, and inhibitor resistance. We also use NMR to examine the structure of an isolated transmembrane segment. It must be acknowledged that an isolated membrane segment could have a different structure than that found in an intact membrane protein. However, isolated TM segments from membrane proteins having multiple TM segments, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (17Oblatt-Montal M. Reddy G.L. Iwamoto T.

Biopolymers. 2005; 80: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), have been shown to be both functional and to have structures in good agreement with the segments in the context of the entire protein, where available. An important caveat is that solution conditions may need extensive screening in order to achieve stabilization of the peptide in its physiological structure, for example, the variation in bacteriorhodopsin results of Ref. 19Hunt J.F.

Alderfer J.L. Yeagle P.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1029-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and our previous study of TM IV of NHE1 (13Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Li X.

Following from this body of work, the TM VII peptide was chemically synthesized and used to determine its structure in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. The use of DPC micelles as a membrane mimetic environment in the solution state has been well established through structural studies of both membrane-spanning and membrane-associated proteins or peptides (23Damberg P. Jarvet J. Graslund A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Henry G.D. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 515-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrates that TM VII is structured as an interrupted, likely kinked α-helix. We identify residues critical in transport and those that modify inhibitor resistance. TM VII is distinctly different from TM IV in both its structure and in functional aspects. Materials—EMD87580 was a generous gift of Dr. N. Beier of Merck. PWO DNA polymerase was from Roche Applied Science, and Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent was from Invitrogen. 15N-Labeled, t-Boc-protected amino acids and deuterated solvents were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Deuterated SDS and DPC were purchased from C/D/N Isotopes (Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada) and used without further purification. Site-directed Mutagenesis—To examine and characterize critical amino acids of TM VII of the Na+/H+ exchanger, mutations were made to an expression plasmid containing a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger. The plasmid pYN4+ contains the cDNA of the entire coding region of the Na+/H+ exchanger (12Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Two series of mutants were made (Table 1). One series of mutants was made in which all the residues of TM VII were mutated to alanine. A second series was for insertional mutagenesis, whereby alanine residues were inserted at critical locations between residues of TM VII in the wild type pYN4+. Two alanine insertional mutants were made, one inserting an alanine between Gly261 and Glu262, and a second inserting an alanine between Leu264 and Leu265. A third insertional mutant had two mutations, a glutamate inserted between Gly261 and Glu262 plus an N266D mutation. Site-directed mutagenesis using amplification with PWO DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) was followed by using the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. Mutations created a new restriction enzyme site for use in screening transformants. DNA sequencing confirmed the mutations and fidelity of PCR.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesisMutationObligonucleotide sequence (alanine scanning)Restriction site1251A5′-GAGGAAATTCACgcgAATGAGCTGCTG-3′BcgIN252A5′-GGAAATTCACATCgcTGAGCTcCTGCACATCCTTG-3′SstIE253A5′-TTCACATCAATGcGCTcCTcCACATCCTTGTTTTTG-3′BseRI1L254A5′-CACATCAATGAagcttTGCACATCCTTG-3′HindIIIL255A5′-CATCAATGAGCTagcGCACATCCTTG-3′NheIH256A5′-CAATGAGCTGCTagcCATCCTTGTTTTTGG-3′NheII257A5′-CAATGAGCTGCTGCAtgcCCTTGTTTTTGGG-3′SphIL258A5′-GAGCTGCTGCAtATCgcTGTTTTTGGGGAG-3′(BsgI)V259A5′-GCTGCACATCCTTgcaTTcGGGGAGTCCTTGC-3′BsmIF260A5′-GCACATCCTTGTTgccGGcGAGTCCTTGCTC-3′NaeIG261A5′-CATCCTTGTTTTTGcGGAaagCTTGCTCAATGACG-3′HindIIIE262A5′-CCTTGTTTTTGGGGcaagCTTGCTCAATGACG-3′HindIIIS263A5′-CTTGTTTTTGGGGAGgCCTTGCTCAATGAC-3′StuIL264A5′-GTTTTTGGGGAGTCCgcttTaAATGACGCCGTCAC-3′DraIL265A5′-GTTTTTGGGGAGTCCcTcgcgAATGACGCCGTCAC-3′NruIN266A5′-TTGGGAGTCCTTGCTagcTGACGCCGTCACTG-3′NheID267A5′-GTCCTTGCTCAATGctGCaGTCACTGTGGTCC-3′PstIV269A5′-CTCAATGACGCCGcgACTGTGGTgCTGTATC-3′BcgIT270A5′-CAATGACGCCGTCgCgGTcGTCCTGTATCAC-3′BsiEIV271A5′-GACGCCGTCACTGcaGTCCTGTATCACC-3′PstIV272A5′-GACGCCGTCACgGTcgcCCTGTATCACCTC-3′BsiEIL273A5′-GTCACTGTGGTCgcGTATCACCTCTTTG-3′(AvaII)MutationOligonucleotide sequenceRestriction siteG261-A-262E5′-CACATCCTTGTTTTTGGcgccGAGTCCTTGCTCAATGACG-3′NarIL264-A-265L5′-GGGAGTCCTTagcgCTCAATGACG-3′Eco47IIIG261-E-262E5′-TGTTTTTGGGgagGAaagcttgcTCAATG-3′HindIIIN266DGTCCTTGCTCgAcgacgccGTCACDrdI Open table in a new tab Cell Culture and Transfections—To examine Na+/H+ exchanger expression and activity, AP-1 cells were used that lack an endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger (14Murtazina B. Booth B.J. Bullis B.L. Singh D.N. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Transfection with Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used to make stable cell lines of all mutants as described earlier (12Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected using 800 μg/ml geneticin (G418), and stable cell lines for experiments were regularly re-established from frozen stocks at passage numbers between 5 and 9. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—To confirm NHE1 expression, cell lysates were made from AP-1 cells as described earlier (12Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of up to 100 μg of each sample were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Nitrocellulose transfers were immunostained using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio/Can, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting and detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize immunoreactive proteins. Densitometric analysis of x-ray films was using NIH Image 1.63 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Cell Surface Expression—Cell surface expression was measured with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) essentially as described earlier (12Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell surface was labeled with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, and immobilized streptavidin resin was used to remove plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger. Equivalent amounts of the total and unbound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and densitometry as described above. The relative amount of NHE1 on the cell surface was calculated by comparing both the 110- and the 95-kDa HA-immunoreactive species in Western blots of the total and unbound fractions. Na+/H+ Exchange Activity—Na+/H+ exchange activity was measured using a PTI Deltascan spectrofluorometer. The initial rate of Na+-induced recovery of cytosolic pH (pHi) was measured after ammonium chloride-induced acute acid load using 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein-AM (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Recovery was in the presence of 135 mm NaCl and was measured as described previously (13Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Li X. Liu Y. Cheng F.J. Lindhout D.A. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17863-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). There was no difference in the buffering capacities of stable cell lines as indicated by the degree of acidification induced by ammonium chloride. For some experiments cells were treated with EMD87580 of varying concentrations. EMD87580 was dissolved in water, and the inhibitory effect of EMD87580 was documented using a two-pulse acidification assay. Cells were treated with ammonium chloride two times and allowed to recover in NaCl-containing medium. One pulse was in the absence of EMD87580 and one in the presence of inhibitor. The rate of recovery from acid load was compared ± inhibitor. Where indicated, the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger mutants was corrected for the level of protein expression and for the targeting of the protein to the cell surface. Results are shown as mean ± S.E., and statistical significance was determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—TM VII peptides (sequence, HINELLHILVFGESLLNDAVTVVLYKK; free N terminus, amide-capped C terminus) with and without selective 15N labels were synthesized and purified using previously published t-Boc solid-phase techniques optimized for hydrophobic membrane-spanning peptides (25Zhang Y.P. Lewis R.N. Hodges R.S. McElhaney R.N. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 847-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), with the difference that purification was carried out using a Zorbax 300 SB-C3 9.4-mm × 25-cm HPLC column (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Peptide identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and by amino acid analysis. NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculation—Samples for structural study were obtained by dissolving ∼1mm synthetic TM VII peptide in 90% H2O, 10% D2O solution containing ∼75 mm DPC-d38. Chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid at 1.0 mm, with indirect referencing employed for 15N (26Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Solution pH was adjusted to 4.8 (deuterium isotope effects not taken into account), and all experiments were carried out at 30 °C. One-dimensional 1H, natural abundance gradient-enhanced 1H-13C HSQC, TOCSY (60-ms mix; DIPSI spin lock), and NOESY (225–250-ms mix) experiments were acquired on the Canadian National High Field NMR Centre Varian INOVA 800-MHz spectrometer for each sample. With the selectively 15N-labeled peptide, additional three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (250-ms mix) and TOCSY-HSQC (57-ms mix, DIPSI spin lock) experiments were acquired at 500-MHz on a Varian Inova spectrometer. All experiments were used as configured within the Varian BioPack software package. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe (27Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Sparky 3 (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). Structure calculation was carried out in the python scripting interface of XPLOR-NIH version 2.13 (28Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) using NOE restraints derived from the 225- and 250-ms mixing time experiments at 800 MHz. Homonuclear NOESY peaks were manually picked in Sparky, and volumes were calculated using Gaussian fits, with motion of the peak center generally allowed; in some cases (∼1.5%) in the NOESY spectra, Sparky's gaussian fit algorithm did not find a convergent solution, and a summed signal intensity was used instead over a manually specified region. Initial NOE calibration was carried out empirically from peak volumes to provide a value in the range of 1.8–6.0 Å; this was carried out separately for each spectrum in order to normalize for mixing time. These estimates were used to bin each restraint into one of strong (1.8–2.8 Å), medium (1.8–3.6 Å), weak (1.8–5.0 Å), or very weak (1.8–6.0 Å). Ambiguous assignments were handled using the XPLOR-NIH “or” statement, with the “sum” averaging option employed and the “number of monomers” parameter set to 1. The NOE term used the hard (square well) potential with a scaling factor of 20 for the high temperature stage and a ramped scaling factor over the range 1–30 for the cooling stage. The dihedral angle potential used a constant scaling factor of 5 (rounds 1–8) or 25 (rounds 9–10) throughout the annealing protocol. Families of structures were generated using simulated annealing with a high temperature stage at 3500 K of length 20 ps and a slow cooling stage going from 3500 to 100 K in 25 K temperature steps for 2-ps stages. Time steps of 10 fs were used in each case. Structure calculations were carried out in two different manners. In one, a single extended polypeptide was generated and subjected to simulated annealing. In the other, two extended polypeptides with identical TM VII primary sequence were generated. In this case, each intra-residue NOE was doubled to apply to each conformer. All other NOEs were made ambiguous, allowing satisfaction through the XPLOR-NIH summed average by any combination of intra-polypeptide and inter-polypeptide NOE restraints. To handle the multiple conformations of the TM VII peptide being produced and to allow practical generation and analysis of numerous ambiguous restraints, an in-house tcl/tk script (freely available upon request) was used to iteratively refine the NOE restraints. As will be discussed below, use of two conformations allowed satisfaction of all NOE restraints, whereas a single conformation required significant pruning of the family of NOE restraints. Analysis and NOE refinement are therefore only described for the two-conformer calculation. Families of 50–200 structures were generated, and NOE violations were analyzed over each ensemble of structures. A series of NOE restraint refinements was carried out. Initially, violations >0.5 Å in >50% of structures were lengthened by one category; over subsequent rounds, the violation threshold was subsequently decreased incrementally to 0.05 Å and the number of violators to >10%. After 8 cycles of simulated annealing and NOE refinement, calculated XPLOR-NIH structure energies contained minimal contributions from NOE violations; violations were not observed in >10% of the ensemble for any NOEs, and magnitudes of all observed violations were minimal. Two further cycles of simulated annealing were carried out with increased weighting on the dihedral angle restraints with further, very minor, NOE restraint refinements carried out using the most stringent bounds given above between rounds 9 and 10. From this ensemble of 60 two-conformer structures, the lowest energy 33 ensemble members (selected based upon an arbitrary cutoff of 60 kcal/mol in XPLOR-NIH total energy values) containing 66 polypeptide conformers were retained for further analysis. The final sets of restraints have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry 2HTG) along with this ensemble of structures. Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis—To determine which amino acids of TM VII were critical to targeting, expression, and activity, we mutated each amino acid of this transmembrane segment to alanine. Fig. 2, A–C, illustrates a Western blot demonstrating expression of the NHE alanine scanning mutants in AP-1 cells stably transfected with HA-tagged Na+/H+ exchanger. The expression levels of the Na+/H+ exchanger varied slightly from one stable cell line to another. All of the mutants expressed the protein although the levels varied from 31 to 149% of the control. All mutants expressed the 110-kDa glycosylated form of the protein and a smaller 95-kDa unglycosylated form of the protein. We have earlier shown that unglycosylated Na+/H+ exchanger may be functional (29Haworth R.S. Frohlich O. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); therefore, the unglycosylated protein was included in analysis of the levels of protein expression. The E262A mutant was found predominantly as unglycosylated protein, similar to the E262Q mutation that we reporter earlier (14Murtazina B. Booth B.J. Bullis B.L. Singh D.N. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All other mutants were found as predominantly 110-kDa isoforms. Expression of L254A, E262A, V272A, and L273A was less than 60% of the control value. We have shown earlier (13Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Li X. Liu Y. Cheng F.J. Lindhout D.A. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17863-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that mutation of amino acids of transmembrane segments can affect surface targeting of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Therefore, we examined intracellular targeting of the NHE1 expressing cell lines within AP-1 cells. Cells were treated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and then lysed and solubilized, and labeled proteins were bound to streptavidin-agarose beads. Equal amounts of total cell lysates and unbound lysates were separated by size using SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting with anti-HA antibody identified the tagged NHE1 protein. Fig. 3 (first 24 panels) illustrates examples of the results and a summary of quantification of at least six experiments. Both the 110- and 95-kDa bands were included in the analysis. The Glu262 mutant was found principally in intracellular compartments. Mostly this was as the 95-kDa unglycosylated form of the protein. Nonspecific binding of NHE1 protein to streptavidin-agarose beads was ∼16%, so the values shown overestimate the level of surface protein. We determined how the mutations of the protein affected the activity. The rate of recovery from an acute acid load was determined as described earlier (30Li X. Ding J. Liu Y. Brix B.J. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16477-16486Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A illustrates the rates of recovery from stable cell lines transfected with either wild type Na+/H+ exchanger or mutants of TM VII. The rate of recovery is also shown when corrected for both the level of expression and surface targeting. The mutants fell into several general categories. Some had less than 50% of wild type activity, when measuring the activity uncorrected for expression levels and targeting. This included Leu254, Leu255, His256, Ile257, Val259, Phe260, Gly261, Glu262, Asn266, Asp267, Thr270, Val271, and Val272. Within this group of mutants with reduced activity, there were subgroups of mutants. One subgroup had direct effects on Na+/H+ exchanger activity. Even after correcting for targeting and the level of expression, the activity was 50% or more reduced compared with controls. This subgroup included Leu255, Ile257, Val259, Phe260, Gly261, Asn266, Asp267, and Thr270. Mutant N266A was not active in contrast to our previous report (14Murtazina B. Booth B.J. Bullis B.L. Singh D.N. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We determined that the earlier results were because of a spontaneous reversion of the mutation (not shown). A different subgroup had reduced expression or targeting to the cell surface, and when correcting for these factors, activity of the mutants was increased to over 60% of controls. This subgroup included Leu254, His256, Glu262, Val271, and Val272. These mutants therefore had normal or relative"
https://openalex.org/W1993086068,"The main groups of living mammals, marsupials and eutherians, are presumed to have diverged in the Early Cretaceous1, but their early history and biogeography are poorly understood. Dental remains have suggested that the eutherians may have originated in Asia2, spreading to North America in the Late Cretaceous, where an endemic radiation of marsupials was already well underway3. Here I describe a new tribosphenic mammal (a mammal with lower molar heels that are three-cusped and basined) from the Early Cretaceous of North America, based on an unusually complete specimen. The new taxon bears characteristics (molarized last premolar, reduction to three molars) otherwise known only for Eutheria among the tribosphenic mammals. Morphometric analysis and character comparisons show, however, that its molar structure is primitive (and thus phylogenetically uninformative), emphasizing the need for caution in interpretation of isolated teeth. The new mammal is approximately contemporaneous with the oldest known Eutheria from Asia. If it is a eutherian, as is indicated by the available evidence, then this group was far more widely distributed in the Early Cretaceous than previously appreciated. An early presence of Eutheria in North America offers a potential source for the continent's Late Cretaceous radiations, which have, in part, proven difficult to relate to contemporary taxa in Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2029093349,"Excavations at the early Neolithic site of Jiahu1,2 in Henan Province, China have produced what may be the earliest complete, playable, tightly-dated multinote musical instruments. Jiahu was occupied from 7000 BC to 5700 BC, considerably antedating the well known Peiligang culture3,4,5. Here we describe six exquisitely made complete flutes which were found in radiocarbon-dated excavation layers, along with fragments of perhaps 30 more. The flutes are made from the ulnae of the red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis Millen) and have 5, 6, 7 and 8 holes. The best preserved flute has been played and tonally analysed. In addition to early musical artefacts, the archaeological record at Jiahu1,2 contains important information on the very foundations of Chinese society. We describe the archaeological characteristics of the Jiahu site, details concerning its dating, its place in the prehistory of the Chinese Neolithic, the ethnicity of its population and the results of a tonal analysis of a nearly 9,000-year-old musical instrument found there."
https://openalex.org/W2026816019,"GATA-1 and PU.1 are transcription factors that control erythroid and myeloid development, respectively. The two proteins have been shown to function in an antagonistic fashion, with GATA-1 repressing PU.1 activity during erythropoiesis and PU.1 repressing GATA-1 function during myelopoiesis. It has also become clear that this functional antagonism involves direct interactions between the two proteins. However, the molecular basis for these interactions is not known, and a number of inconsistencies exist in the literature. We have used a range of biophysical methods to define the molecular details of the GATA-1-PU.1 interaction. A combination of NMR titration data and extensive mutagenesis revealed that the PU.1-Ets domain and the GATA-1 C-terminal zinc finger (CF) form a low affinity interaction in which specific regions of each protein are implicated. Surprisingly, the interaction cannot be disrupted by single alanine substitution mutations, suggesting that binding is distributed over an extended interface. The C-terminal basic tail region of CF appears to be sufficient to mediate an interaction with PU.1-Ets, and neither acetylation nor phosphorylation of a peptide corresponding to this region disrupts binding, indicating that the interaction is not dominated by electrostatic interactions. The CF basic tail shares significant sequence homology with the PU.1 interacting motif from c-Jun, suggesting that GATA-1 and c-Jun might compete to bind PU.1. Taken together, our data provide a molecular perspective on the GATA-1-PU.1 interaction, resolving several issues in the existing data and providing insight into the mechanisms through which these two proteins combine to regulate blood development. GATA-1 and PU.1 are transcription factors that control erythroid and myeloid development, respectively. The two proteins have been shown to function in an antagonistic fashion, with GATA-1 repressing PU.1 activity during erythropoiesis and PU.1 repressing GATA-1 function during myelopoiesis. It has also become clear that this functional antagonism involves direct interactions between the two proteins. However, the molecular basis for these interactions is not known, and a number of inconsistencies exist in the literature. We have used a range of biophysical methods to define the molecular details of the GATA-1-PU.1 interaction. A combination of NMR titration data and extensive mutagenesis revealed that the PU.1-Ets domain and the GATA-1 C-terminal zinc finger (CF) form a low affinity interaction in which specific regions of each protein are implicated.

The development of the erythroid and myeloid blood cell lineages is controlled in part by the master transcriptional regulators GATA-1 and PU.1 (1Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 2Moreau-Gachelin F. Ray D. Mattei M.G. Tambourin P. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1449-1456PubMed Google Scholar). GATA-1 plays an indispensable role in erythroid development, as indicated by the failure of embryonic erythropoiesis in GATA-1-null mice (3Fujiwara Y. Browne C.P. Cunniff K. Goff S.C. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12355-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Conversely, the inactivation of the PU.1 gene causes defects in the development of myeloid lineages and B and T lymphocytes (4McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 5Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar).Considerable evidence exists to suggest that there is functional antagonism between GATA-1 and PU.1 and that this antagonism is important for determining lineage commitment (erythroid versus myeloid) during hematopoiesis (reviewed in Ref. 6Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For example, forced GATA-1 expression leads to the reprogramming of myeloid precursors into erythroid cells or retrodifferentiation into multipotent progenitors (7Kulessa H. Frampton J. Graf TID. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1250-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 8Visvader J.E. Elefanty A.G. Strasser A. Adams J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4557-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Similarly, PU.1 expression can result in a block in erythroid differentiation in cellular assays (9Rao G. Rekhtman N. Cheng G. Krasikov T. Skoultchi A.I. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Yamada T. Kondoh N. Matsumoto M. Yoshida M. Maekawa A. Oikawa T. Blood. 1997; 89: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the block can be relieved by co-expression of GATA-1. Transient transfection assays in which either GATA-1 or PU.1 binding sites are placed in front of a reporter gene likewise reveal that each of the two proteins will repress activation by the other (11Rekhtman N. Radparvar F. Evans T. Skoultchi A.I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1398-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 12Zhang P. Behre G. Pan J. Iwama A. Wara-Aswapati N. Radomska H.S. Auron P.E.

Blood. 2000; 95: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo observations also support this conclusion. Transgenic mice expressing PU.1 in erythroid cells develop erythroleukemias at a high rate (14Moreau-Gachelin F. Wendling F. Molina T. Denis N. Titeux M. Grimber G. Briand P. Vainchenker W. Tavitian A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2453-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), while GATA-1 expression has been detected in several myeloid and megakaryocytic tumors (tissues in which this protein is not normally expressed, Ref. 15Guerrasio A. Saglio G. Rosso C. Alfarano A. Camaschella C. Lo Coco F. Biondi A. Rambaldi A. Nicolis S. Ottolenghi S. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 1034-1038PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, GATA-1 and PU.1 each appear to inhibit the transactivation activity of the other.Recent chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 4The abbreviations used are: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; CF, GATA-1 C-terminal zinc finger; PDB, Protein Data Bank, MBP, maltose-binding protein.4The abbreviations used are: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; CF, GATA-1 C-terminal zinc finger; PDB, Protein Data Bank, MBP, maltose-binding protein. data have established that GATA-1 and PU.1 can colocalize on promoters (16Stopka T. Amanatullah D.F. Papetti M. Skoultchi A.I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3712-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Rekhtman N. Choe K.S. Matushansky I. Murray S. Stopka T. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7460-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and that this colocalization is required for their antagonistic activity. These data have further demonstrated that the mechanism by which PU.1 inhibits the expression of GATA-1 target genes involves PU.1 recruiting chromatin-modifying proteins (including heterochromatin protein 1, C-terminalbinding protein and retinoblastoma protein (RB)) to genes to which GATA-1 is bound (16Stopka T. Amanatullah D.F. Papetti M. Skoultchi A.I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3712-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The repressed chromatin structure created by this complex can subsequently be released during erythroid development by down-regulation of PU.1 (17Rekhtman N. Choe K.S. Matushansky I. Murray S. Stopka T. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7460-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).It has also been shown in several independent studies that the two proteins are able to physically interact both in vitro and in a cellular context. The in vitro data mostly comprise GST pulldown assays (11Rekhtman N. Radparvar F. Evans T. Skoultchi A.I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1398-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 12Zhang P.

Querfurth E. Kulessa H. Graf T. Blood. 2000; 95: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while co-immunoprecipitations (both from endogenous proteins in K562 (12Zhang P. Behre G. Pan J. Iwama A. Wara-Aswapati N. Radomska H.S. Auron P.E. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8705-8710Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and MEL (11Rekhtman N. Radparvar F. Evans T. Skoultchi A.I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1398-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) cells and from transfected protein in 293 cells, Ref. 11Rekhtman N. Radparvar F. Evans T. Skoultchi A.I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1398-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) have been used to draw conclusions about the formation of PU.1·GATA-1 complexes inside cells. Taken together, these data appear to indicate that a direct interaction can take place between GATA-1 and PU.1, and that the regions responsible for this interaction are the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1 (CF) and the Ets domain of PU.1 (Fig. 1). ChIP data additionally show that colocalization of GATA-1 and PU.1 at a gene promoter is dependent on the PU.1-Ets domain (17Rekhtman N. Choe K.S. Matushansky I. Murray S. Stopka T. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7460-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The CF and Ets domains also mediate DNA binding of GATA-1 and PU.1, respectively, and additionally have been implicated in mediating interactions with other protein partners. For instance, GATA-1 is thought to associate with CBP and EKLF/Sp1 through its C-finger (18Blobel G.A. Nakajima T. Eckner R. Montminy M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), while PU.1-Ets can recruit c-Jun (20Behre G. Whitmarsh A.J. Coghlan M.P. Hoang T. Carpenter C.L. Zhang D.E. Davis R.J.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 4330-4338PubMed Google Scholar).Whereas the repression of GATA-1 activity by PU.1 involves the creation of repressive chromatin structures, inhibition of PU.1 activity by GATA-1 appears to involve the transcription factor c-Jun. GATA-1 can antagonize c-Jun-mediated activation of PU.1-driven reporter genes, and GST pulldowns indicate that GATA-1 and c-Jun compete for the same binding site on PU.1-Ets (12Zhang P. Behre G. Pan J. Iwama A. Wara-Aswapati N. Radomska H.S. Auron P.E. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8705-8710Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar).To define the underlying molecular nature of the GATA-1-PU.1 interaction, we have carried out a range of biochemical and biophysical experiments on purified protein domains. We report here the regions of the CF and Ets domains that contact each other and use this and other data to draw conclusions regarding the mechanism through which the two master regulators cooperate to drive hematopoietic differentiation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGST Pulldowns—Wild-type CF (murine GATA-1 residues 248-318), as well as a range of substitution and truncation mutants (CF300: residues 248-300 and CF308: residues 248-308), were overexpressed as GST fusion proteins and immobilized onto glutathione beads according to standard procedures (Amersham Biosciences). Similarly, GST fusions of wild-type and mutant PU.1-Ets domains (human PU.1 residues 158-270), MBP-PU.1-Ets and MBP-CF were also prepared. Amylose-agarose-bound MBP proteins were eluted with 10 mm maltose (in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8). Glutathione beads with equal amounts of GST fusion proteins (as judged by SDS-PAGE) and the appropriate MBP fusion protein were mixed in pull-down buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Igepal CA-630, 1.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 8) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with shaking. The beads were washed repeatedly with pull-down buffer (omitting the bovine serum albumin). The bound proteins were released by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading dye and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The presence of the MBP-fusion proteins was detected by antiMBP antiserum (New England Biolabs).For pulldowns carried out in the presence of ethidium bromide, GST, GST-CF, and MBP-PU.1 Ets were overexpressed, and samples were prepared either in the absence or presence of EtBr. Soluble fractions treated with 100 μg/ml EtBr were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. For EtBr-treated samples, the following steps were carried out in the presence of 30 μg/ml EtBr. GST-CF was immobilized onto glutathione beads for 1 h at 4 °C and washed with binding buffer, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X, 1.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol. GST or GST-CF beads were mixed with MBP-PU.1-Ets lysate in binding buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with wash buffer, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm ZnCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 4.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The bound proteins were eluted by heating at 85 °C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading dye.Synthesis, Purification, and Acetylation of the CFtail Peptide—A peptide corresponding to residues Ala309-Gly318 of murine GATA-1 (CFtail) was synthesized manually according to the Merrifield technique using the standard Fmoc protocol (23Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6610) Google Scholar). An additional tyrosine residue was incorporated at the N terminus of the peptide (giving the sequence YASGKGKKKRG) to permit concentration determination by A280. The crude peptide was purified by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column and a water-acetonitrile (in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) gradient. To obtain the acetylated peptide, purified lyophilized peptide was resuspended in equal volumes of 3 m sodium acetate and acetic anhydride. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 8, and the reaction mixture shaken overnight at 4 °C. The acetylated mixture was then subjected to another round of rpHPLC, and the major species corresponded to CFtail peptide with five acetyl groups (Ac-CFtail). The identity and purity of the purified peptides were confirmed by ESI-MS. A peptide corresponding to CFtail with the sole serine phosphorylated was purchased from AusPep (Melbourne) and used without further purification. Peptides were lyophilized and stored at -20 °C until use.Protein Expression and Purification—The PU.1-Ets domain (residues 158-270 hPU.1) and CF (residues 237-317 of mGATA-1) were both cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET3a vector (Novogen) and the plasmids transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)-CodonPlus ® (Stratagene) cells. Overexpression of the untagged proteins was induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C. The proteins were initially purified using SP Sepharose™ Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) at pH 9 (in 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT), using stepwise increases in salt concentration to elute the proteins. Fractions containing protein were then diluted in order to decrease the salt concentration and further purified on a MonoS™ HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The purified proteins were generally concentrated and dialyzed into the buffer required for subsequent experiments. In some cases, the proteins were further purified by reversed phase HPLC using a C18 column, then lyophilized and refolded in the required buffer with the addition of stoichiometric Zn(II). The activation domain of human PU.1 (residues 1-71) was subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), overexpressed at 37 °C, and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography and reversed phase HPLC (following cleavage from the GST tag using thrombin). For the preparation of 15N and 15N,13C-labeled proteins, the procedure of Cai et al. (24Cai M. Huang Y. Sakaguchi K. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Craigie R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) was used. Far-UV circular dichroism and one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy were used to assess the folding of each domain.NMR Spectroscopy—NMR data were acquired on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer and Varian Innova 750-MHz and 800-MHz spectrometers. Samples (CF and Ets) were dialyzed into one of the following buffers: (a)5mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, (b)50mm phosphate pH 7, 1 mm DTT, or (c)50mm MES, pH 6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. In all cases, buffers were made up in 95:5 H2O:D2O and 10 μm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid was added as a chemical shift reference. Samples were concentrated to 400-800 μm using centrifugal concentrators and NMR data were recorded at 298 K. Backbone resonance assignments of both the Ets and CF domains were obtained using a combination of homonuclear and standard triple resonance experiments. Data were processed using either NMRPipe (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11375) Google Scholar) or XINNMR and analyzed with XEASY (26Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter P. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar), Sparky (27Goddard T. Kneller D. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2001Google Scholar) and AUTOASSIGN (28Zimmerman D.E. Kulikowski C.A. Huang Y. Feng W. Tashiro M. Shimotakahara S. Chien C. Powers R. Montelione G.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 592-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Automated assignments were verified by manual inspection and by comparison with previously reported assignments (29Jia X. Lee L.K. Light J. Palmer 3rd, A.G. Assa-Munt N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Chemical Shift Perturbation Experiments—For the titration of [15N]Ets with CF, samples of 15N-labeled PU.1-Ets alone (0.15 mm) and a mixture of 15N-labeled-PU.1-Ets (0.15 mm) and unlabeled CF in a 1:13 molar ratio were prepared. The titration was performed at 25 °C by adding aliquots of the second sample to the first sample in eight intervals. In this way the concentration of 15N-labeled PU.1-Ets remained unchanged throughout the titration while the concentration of unlabeled CF was gradually increased, to a final concentration of 1.9 mm (13 molar equivalents). 15N HSQC spectra were recorded at each interval of the titration, and pH was carefully monitored. The reverse titration experiment was performed using an identical procedure. Manually placed cross-peaks were verified using the peak detection function of NMRDraw (part of the NMRPipe software). Overall weighted average chemical shift changes (Δavg) were calculated for all residues using the equation: Δavg = (((δH)2 + (δN × 0.154)2)/2)1/2 (30Ayed A. Mulder F.A. Yi G.S. Lu Y. Kay L.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and fitted to a 1:1 binding model using nonlinear least squares regression.The lyophilized CFtail peptides (wild-type, acetylated, and phosphorylated forms) were resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7. To a solution of 760 μm 15N-PU.1-Ets, wild-type CFtail (7.7 mm) was added to 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 12.4 molar equivalents, while acetylated CFtail (5.5 mm) was added to 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 7.3 molar equivalents in a separate experiment. Phosphorylated CFtail was added to [15N]PU.1-Ets at levels of 1, 6, 17, 33, and 66 molar equivalents. Titrations were performed at 25 °C and 15N HSQC spectra were recorded after each addition.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Reactions were set up in a total volume of 30 μl, comprising 0.1 pg of 32P-labeled probe, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml dIdC, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Quantitative EMSAs were carried out using either: (a)50pm 32P-labeled GATA dsDNA mixed with 0-250 nm of MBP-CF and 500 nm untagged PU.1-Ets or (b)40pm 32P-labeled Ets dsDNA mixed with 0-120 nm PU.1-Ets and 60 nm of MBP-CF. After incubation on ice for 10 min, samples were loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel made up in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. The gel was then subjected to electrophoresis at 15 V/cm and 4 °C for 2 h, dried, analyzed, and quantified when necessary using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The probes used in the experiments were end-labeled according to standard procedures using polynucleotide kinase. The sequence of GATA and Ets probes were 5′-GTT GCA GAT AAA CATT-3′ (the same sequence used in the determination of the structure of CF bound to DNA, Ref. 31Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and 5′-TCG AAT AAA ATC AGG AAC TTG-3′, respectively. DNA binding affinities were estimated by nonlinear least squares analysis as described in Ref. 32Simpson R.J. Cram E.D. Czolij R. Matthews J.M. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28011-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Complementary 16-bp oligonucleotides containing the Ets consensus site (5′-AAAAAGGGGAAGTGGG-3′) were annealed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min and slowly cooling to room temperature in 10 mm Tris (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA. DNA concentrations were measured using A260. Titrations were carried out on a Microcal VPITC microcalorimeter at 25 °C. All samples were dialyzed extensively into a buffer composed of 20 mm MES (pH 6), 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. CF (280 μm) was titrated into a solution of DNA (28 μm) or a solution of the 1:1 PU.1-Ets·DNA complex. Each titration consisted of 20 × 15-μl injections separated by 30-min or 8-min intervals. The reference power was set at 10 μcal s-1 with continuous stirring at 310 rpm. Using the Microcal Origin software package (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA), data were analyzed and fitted using a single binding site model.RESULTSIdentification of the PU.1 Binding Motif in GATA-1—In agreement with recent reports (11Rekhtman N. Radparvar F. Evans T. Skoultchi A.I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1398-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 12Zhang P. Behre G. Pan J. Iwama A. Wara-Aswapati N. Radomska H.S. Auron P.E.

Blood. 2000; 95: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), preliminary GST pulldown assays indicated that the interaction between GATA-1 and PU.1 is mediated by the GATA-1 CF and the PU.1-Ets domain (data not shown). To pinpoint the specific elements within CF that are responsible for contacting PU.1, we constructed a library of CF substitution and deletion mutants that covered the entire surface of CF. These mutants were then tested for their ability to bind to the PU.1-Ets domain in GST pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 2, none of the 35 point mutations (single and double mutations) significantly impaired the binding of CF to PU.1-Ets. However, truncation of the C-terminal basic tail region of CF (residues 309-318) essentially abrogated the interaction, indicating that this region is important for the interaction with PU.1. Interestingly, the panel of point mutants included a number of both single and double mutants in the basic tail region but these mutations did not eliminate the interaction in this assay.FIGURE 2The basic tail of CF is necessary for PU.1 binding. A, sequence of GATA-1 CF, showing the 37 mutants used in this study. Residues shaded in gray are those mutated to alanine, while non-alanine mutations are shown with arrows.

Retained MBP-PU.1-Ets domain was detected with an anti-MBP antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further probe the means through which GATA-1 recognizes PU.1, we carried out a chemical shift perturbation study, monitoring the 15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled CF (residues 237-317 of mGATA-1) upon the addition of unlabeled PU.1-Ets (residues 158-270 of human PU.1). As shown in Fig. 3A, small but significant changes are observed for several signals in the spectrum, while most signals remain unchanged. Chemical shift changes (averaged over 1H and 15N) are plotted versus residue number in Fig. 3B, revealing that many of the largest changes occur for residues toward the C-terminal end of the α-helix in CF (e.g. Gly283, Leu284, Leu288, His289, Gln290, Arg293). Smaller changes were also clustered in the N-terminal (Ile242, Met248, Ser251) and to a much lesser extent the C-terminal regions (Ala309, Ser310) of the domain.FIGURE 315N HSQC titration data for the addition of Ets to 15N-CF. A, selected region of the 15N HSQC of CF is shown, both alone (solid contours) and following the addition of 2 molar equivalents of PU.1-Ets (dotted contours). Residues that underwent the largest changes in this region of the spectrum are underlined. Stars represent unassigned peaks.

These observations indicate that the magnitude of the interaction between GATA-1 and PU.1 is probably <∼104 m-1.Using the chemical shift changes and the GST pull-down assays as a guide, we constructed three quadruple point mutants, in which two additional mutations were incorporated into the His289-Gln290 (→ AA) double mutant: in turn, Ala309-Ser310, Gly311-Lys212 or Lys315-Lys316 were mutated (to VA, AA, or AA, respectively). Of these three quadruple mutants, only the third exhibited any detectable decrease in binding to PU.1-Ets (data not shown).Identification of the GATA-1 Binding Motif in PU.1—We next sought to determine which residues in the Ets domain of PU.1 are involved in recruiting GATA-1. We therefore carried out a 15N HSQC titration, adding unlabeled CF into 15N-labeled Ets (Fig. 4A). While the majority of the PU.1-Ets amide resonances remained unaffected, a few resonances underwent small (<∼0.1 ppm in the 1H dimension) chemical shift changes. An analysis of the changes in average amide chemical shifts of PU.1-Ets on titration with CF (Fig. 4B) indicated that the chemical environments of the backbone amides of residues Leu172, Tyr173, His205, Glu207, Lys227, Met228, and Lys245, together with the side chain indole NH of Trp213 and the side chain amide group of Asn219, underwent the largest changes in the presence of increasing amounts of CF (more than one standard deviation greater than the mean change). Again, the observed chemical shift changes were modest, consistent with a relatively weak interaction and only partial saturation of PU.1-Ets.FIGURE 4Delineation of the GATA-1 binding surface of PU.1-Ets. A, representative portions of 15N HSQC spectra of [15N]PU.1-Ets during the titration with CF.

Paired Dps proteins in Bacillus, rare in other bacteria, have 60% sequence identity. To explore functional differences in paired Bacilli Dps protein, we measured ferroxidase activity and DNA protection (hydroxyl radical) for Dps protein dodecamers from Bacillus anthracis (Ba) since crystal structures and iron mineralization (iron-stain) were known. The self-assembled (200 kDa) Ba Dps1 (Dlp-1) and Ba Dps2 (Dlp-2) proteins had similar Fe2+/O2 kinetics, with space for minerals of 500 iron atoms/protein, and protected DNA. The reactions with Fe2+ were novel in several ways: 1) Ba Dps2 reactions (Fe2+/H2O2) proceeded via an A650 nm intermediate, with similar rates to maxi-ferritins (Fe2+/O2), indicating a new Dps protein reaction pathway, 2) Ba Dps2 reactions (Fe2+/O2 versus Fe2+/O2 + H2O2) differed 3-fold contrasting with Escherichia coli Dps reactions, with 100-fold differences, and 3) Ba Dps1, inert in Fe2+/H2O2 catalysis, inhibited protein-independent Fe2+/H2O2 reactions. Sequence similarities between Ba Dps1 and Bacillus subtilis DpsA (Dps1), which is regulated by general stress factor (SigmaB) and Fur, and between Ba Dps2 and B. subtilis MrgA, which is regulated by H2O2 (PerR), suggest the function of Ba Dps1 is iron sequestration and the function of Ba Dps2 is H2O2 destruction, important in host/pathogen interactions.

Destruction of H2O2 by Ba Dps2 proceeds via an unknown mechanism with an intermediate similar spectrally (A650 nm) and kinetically to the maxi-ferritin diferric peroxo complex. Dps (DNA protection during starvation) proteins are a family of bacterial proteins in the ferritin superfamily, first identified in Escherichia coli as dodecameric DNA-binding proteins in cells stressed by starvation (1Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The proteins are stable nanocages with large (5-nm diameter) central cavities (2Chiancone E. Ceci P. Ilari A. Ribacchi F. Stefanini S. Biometals. 2004; 17: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Liu X. Theil E.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2005; 38: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and have been observed in vivo as part of biocrystalline complexes with DNA (e.g. see Ref. 4Wolf S.G. Frenkiel D. Arad T. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Minsky A. Nature. 1999; 400: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Protection of DNA from damage by free radicals, the common property of Dps proteins, is accomplished by converting oxidants and iron released during stress to benign, hydrated, ferric oxide minerals inside the Dps protein cage (2Chiancone E. Ceci P. Ilari A. Ribacchi F. Stefanini S. Biometals. 2004; 17: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Liu X. Theil E.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2005; 38: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Because only some Dps protein dodecamers bind DNA but all protect DNA from hydroxyl radical damage in vitro, the mechanisms of Dps protein protection of DNA from oxidant damage and other stresses such as nucleases, radiation, and heat are subjects of active study (e.g. Refs. 2Chiancone E.

When DNA-Dps interactions occur, N- or C-terminal protein extensions that protrude from the protein nanocages are thought to be involved (10Ceci P. Cellai S. Falvo E. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L.

The ability of Helicobacter pylori, Borrelia burgdorferi, and other pathogens to survive oxidative burst killing within macrophages and neutrophils has been attributed to Dps protein dodecamer protection of DNA based on the increased oxidant sensitivity of dps deletion mutants (e.g. Refs. 12O'Rourke E.J.

No comparative studies of the reaction properties of pairs of Dps proteins have been made to our knowledge.The ferritin superfamily, of which Dps protein dodecamers are members, are protein nanocages that form protein-encased minerals of hydrated ferric oxide through a series of steps. First, oxidation of two ferrous ions occurs at catalytic sites in the protein cage that are related to catalytic sites in di-iron oxygenases, such as stearoyl-acyl carrier protein Δ9-fatty acyl desaturase, ribonucleotide reductase, and methane monooxygenase, except that in the ferritins the iron is a substrate (3Liu X. Theil E.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2005; 38: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In maxiferritins, the first step in iron mineralization is the oxidation of coupled diferrous ions with O2 via a diferric peroxo complex (19Pereira A.S. Small W. Krebs C. Tavares P. Edmondson D.E.

Then, by mechanisms unknown, the mineral precursors move through the protein cage to the cavity and are concentrated by clustered carboxylates on the inner surface of the protein cavity and, later, at the mineral surface; inorganic hydrolysis and polymerization in the ferritin cavity form the hydrated ferric oxide minerals. Bacterial Dps proteins are miniferritins with 12 subunits (2Chiancone E. Ceci P. Ilari A. Ribacchi F. Stefanini S. Biometals. 2004; 17: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Liu X.

MrgA in B. subtilis, for example, now known to be a dps gene, is regulated by PerR and responds to peroxide-specific transcriptional regulation. DpsA, the second dps gene in B. subtilis, is regulated by the SigmaB factor in stationery phase and Fur in log phase, responding to glucose starvation, metal, heat, and osmotic stresses. To compare biochemical properties of Dps protein pairs, we chose to study the Dps protein dodecamers from Bacillus anthracis, since they are the only Bacillus Dps proteins for which the crystal structures are known (31Papinutto E.

Dps1 and Ba Dps2 protein dodecamers have different reactions with Fe2+/H2O2 and similar reaction rates with Fe2+/O2. In Ba Dps2 the rate increased 3-fold with H2O2, but with Ba Dps1 no protein-dependent rate was detected. In anaerobic conditions an A650 nm intermediate (diferric peroxo) characteristic of the animal maxi-ferritin Fe2+/O2 reaction was observed in the Ba Dps2 Fe2+/H2O2 reaction. Both Ba Dps1 and Ba Dps2 protected DNA from oxidative damage (Fe2+ + H2O2 in air), but Ba Dps1 was less effective than Ba Dps2. The different activities of Ba Dps1 and Ba Dps2 with Fe2+ and H2O2 in air and the enhanced activity of Ba Dps2 in the absence of oxygen suggest that each protein contributes to bacterial survival under different sets of conditions in vivo and together provide protection against a wide range of environmental stresses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning—To clone the dps genes from B. anthracis dlp-1 (Ba dps1) and dlp-2 (Ba dps2), coding regions for Ba Dps1 and Ba Dps2 were amplified from the chromosomal DNA of B. anthracis (Sterne 34-F2) by PCR with the following primers: Ba Dps1F, 5′-CAAACACATGAACAAACAAGTAATC; Ba Dps1R, 5′-CAACTGGATCCTTATTGATTCAAGGATCCAAC; Ba Dps2F, 5′-CAAACACATGGAGTACGAAAACAAATG; Ba Dps2R, 5′-TTTAAGAACGCACTTAGCATGGATCCAAC. NdeI and BamH1 sites (underlined) were created during amplification for subcloning into an E. coli expression vector. Amplified PCR products were cloned into Topo vectors using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) to create plasmids Topo II-Ba Dps1 and Topo II-Ba Dps2. The DNA fragments of Ba dps1 and Ba dps2 were then excised from Topo II-Ba Dps1 and Topo II-Ba Dps2 by restriction digestion with NdeI and BamH1 and ligated into the multiple cloning sites of the protein expression vector pET-3a (Invitrogen), yielding plasmids pET-3a-Ba Dps1 and pET-3a-Ba Dps2. Both plasmids were sequenced with T7 primer to confirm that the open reading frame contained the correct sequences.Expression, Purification, and Properties of Recombinant Ba Dps1 and Ba Dps2—Protein expression used cultures of E. coli competent cells BL21 (DE3)-Plyss strain (Novae) and conditions previously described (37Liu X. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8557-8562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 42Takagi H. Shi D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol.

After sanitation, cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 2 h at 4 °C at 43,000 × g, and ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant solution to a concentration of 60%, conditions where Ba Dps1 and Ba Dps2 remained soluble. Buffer exchange and dialysis against two changes of 25 mm Bis-trispropane (pH 7.5) was followed by ion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q from GE Healthcare) (buffer, 25 mm Bis-trispropane (pH 7.5); linear gradient, 0 to 1 m NaCl). Fractions containing Ba Dps1 or Ba Dps2, identified by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide), were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a Sephacryl S300 (GE Healthcare) gel-filtration column. Purified Ba Dps1 and Ba Dps2 proteins dialyzed against 100 mm Mops and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.0) and stored at 4 °C appeared to be stable for up to 2 weeks for iron-free proteins and 2 months for mineralized proteins.Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad), and the endogenous or mineralized iron content of the purified, recombinant proteins was analyzed with a colorimetric assay for the detection of Fe2+-phenanthroline at 510 nm (44Jones M.M. Johnston D.O. Nature. 1967; 216: 509-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Analysis of protein purity used electrophoresis in SDS denaturing gels (12%) and in native (4–15%) polyacrylamide gels calibrated with the BroadRange protein marker from Bio-Rad and stained with Coomassie Blue. Proteins with apparent sizes of 200 kDa were observed by native gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and mass spectrometry (see below) and are consistent with the dodecameric assemblies of Dps subunits. Protein purity was >95%, and the endogenous iron content was <0.1 iron atoms/protein nanocage, as previously observed (31Papinutto E. Dundon W.G. Pitulis N. Battistutta R. Montecucco C. Zanotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15093-15098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).To confirm the identity of the expressed protein, peptides produced by denaturation and trypsin digestion of recombinant B. anthracis Ba Dps1 and Ba Dps2 (Trypsin Gold, mass spectrophotometer grade, Promega Inc., at a 1:100 molar ratio (pH 7.8) with incubation for 18 h at 37 °C, before adding 0.5 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Bruker Biflex III, in the negative reflector mode, N2 laser) and calibrated with external standards (Bruker Daltonics). Data were analyzed with SpectroTYPER (sequenom) software; the error of the observed masses was estimated to be 0.1%. Predicted sites of tryptic digestions and masses were obtained with Pepcutter (ExPAcy) software. Four Ba Dps1 tryptic peptides had the following masses: residues 42–59, 2153.0 Da (theoretical) and 2153.3 Da (experimental); residues 12–22, 1293.7 Da (theoretical) and 1293.5 Da (experimental); residues 32–41, 1203.6 Da (theoretical) and 1203.4 Da (experimental); residues 4–11, 942.6 Da (theoretical) and 942.1 Da (experimental); undigested subunit, 16910.43 Da (theoretical) and 16877.5 Da (experimental). Three tryptic peptides from Ba Dps2 had the following masses: residues 44–61, 2196.0 Da (theoretical) and 2195.5 Da (experimental); residues 62–74, 1384.8 Da (theoretical) and 1384.6 Da (experimental); residues 5–13, 1015.6 Da (theoretical) and 1015.3 Da (experimental); undigested subunit, 16648.8 Da (theoretical) and 16771.4 Da (experimental).Formation of the Iron Mineral—Determination of the number of iron atoms that can be accommodated inside the Dps dodecameric protein cages used solutions of recombinant Ba Dps1 and Ba Dps2 proteins in a buffer of 200 mm Mops (pH 7.5) with 200 mm NaCl. Protein solutions were mixed with an equal volume of a freshly prepared solution of FeSO4 in 1 mm HCl to minimize spontaneous oxidation and hydrolysis; 50-fold increments of Fe2+ atoms/protein dodecameric nanocage were added up to 1000 iron atoms. The Fe2+ and protein mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C to complete mineralization (conversion of ferric mineral precursors to mineral), as previously described for maxi-ferritins (36Liu X. Jin W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). After the incubation, Fe2+/protein mixtures were passed through G-25 columns to trap insoluble iron hydroxide precipitates on the top of the gel that were only observed at >500 Fe2+/protein dodecamers. The iron content of mineralized Dps proteins was determined by incubating with dithiothreitol (5 mm) and 2,2′-bipyridyl (5 mm) for 24 h at 4 °C; the Fe2+-bipyridyl complex was analyzed spectrophotometrically (molar extinction coefficient: 8300 m–1 cm–1 at 522 nm).Fe2+ Oxidation Kinetics—To measure the kinetics of iron oxidation by O2, solutions of ferrous substrate (0.12–4.8 mm FeSO4 in 1 mm HCl) were rapidly mixed (1 ms) with an equal volume of Ba Dps1 or Ba Dps2 protein dodecamers (2 mg/ml, 10 μm) in 200 mm Mops/200 mm NaCl at pH 7.0 aerobically or anaerobically using a stopped-flow, UV-visible spectrophotometer (π *, Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK); the molar ratio of Fe2+:protein ranged from 2 to 480 iron atoms per Dps protein dodecamer (1–40 iron per subunit) as previously described (26Zhao G.

Kinetic studies with H2O2 as the oxidant for Fe2+ under aerobic and anaerobic conditions used a small volume of H2O2 added to protein solutions (2 mg/ml (10 μm) protein dodecamers) to a final H2O2 of 10 mm followed by rapid mixing with various [Fe2+] solutions at room temperature (20 °C). In a few experiments anaerobic mixtures of protein dodecamers (10 μm) and Fe2+ were mixed with anaerobic solutions of H2O2 to initiate the reaction, but the change in the order of addition had no effect. The concentration of 10 mm H2O2, chosen to ensure complete Fe2+ oxidation, is consistent with previous studies (46Stillman T.J. Connolly P.P. Latimer C.L. Morland A.F. Quail M.A. Andrews S.C.

https://openalex.org/W2013285339,"The Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) control cell shape and motility and are frequently overexpressed during malignant growth. These proteins act as molecular switches cycling between active GTP- and inactive GDP-bound forms. Despite being membrane anchored via their isoprenylated C termini, Rho GTPases rapidly translocate between membrane and cytosolic compartments. Here, we show that the Rho GTPase Rac1 preferentially interacts with phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing bilayers through its polybasic motif (PBM). Rac1 isoprenylation contributes to membrane avidity but is not critical for PS recognition. The similar protein Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42), however, only associates with PS when prenylated. Conversely, other Rho GTPases such as Rac2, Rac3, and RhoA do not bind to PS even when they are prenylated. Cell stimulation with PS induces translocation of Rac1 toward the plasma membrane and stimulates GTP loading, membrane ruffling, and filopodia formation. This stimulation also promotes Cdc42 activation and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase through Rac1/PS signaling. Consequently, the PBM specifically directs Rac1 to effect cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell migration by selective membrane phospholipid targeting.

Consequently, the PBM specifically directs Rac1 to effect cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell migration by selective membrane phospholipid targeting. The Rho family of GTPases regulates a wide range of cellular processes including the actin cytoskeleton organization, gene transcription, and cell cycle progression (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). These Rho GTPases share high levels of sequence similarity despite their different biological functions (2Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). However, Rho proteins present a divergent C-terminal element, which is named the polybasic motif (PBM), 2The abbreviations used are: PBM, polybasic motif; CHO-K1, Chinese hamster ovary K1; MEK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; PAK1, p21-activated kinase 1; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GEF, guanine nucleotide-exchange factor.2The abbreviations used are: PBM, polybasic motif; CHO-K1, Chinese hamster ovary K1; MEK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; PAK1, p21-activated kinase 1; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GEF, guanine nucleotide-exchange factor. a stretch of basic residues contiguous to the CAAX isoprenylation-site motif (where “C” indicates a cysteine residue, “A” is an aliphatic residue, and “X” any residue). The differential intracellular localization of various Rho GTPases has been characterized (3Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Whereas overexpressed Cdc42 and Rac2 have been shown to be present in endocytic membranes in a Rho guanidine dissociation inhibitor-dependent fashion, Rac1 is localized to the plasma membrane. In contrast, RhoA has been observed predominantly in the cytosol. Thus, it is plausible that divergent features such as the PBM may help determine the localization of Rho GTPases, although the specific mechanisms are not clear.Membrane association is critical for the function of Rho family proteins. Isoprenylation of their C termini plays a major role in membrane anchoring, although these proteins appear to shuttle rapidly between membrane and cytosolic compartments (4Olofsson B. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of specific targeting of these GTPases to plasma versus other internal membranes is still unsolved, their subcellular localization does appear to be influenced by electrostatic membrane interactions of the PBM (5Williams C.L. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Both phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate were initially proposed as Rac1 and RhoA ligands, respectively, binding preferentially to the nucleotide-free state (6Missy K. Van Poucke V. Raynal P. Viala C. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. Payrastre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30279-30286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, these phosphoinositide interactions were not detected by NMR spectroscopy or overlay assays (7Thapar R. Karnoub A.E. Campbell S.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3875-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and their in vivo significance remains unclear.To investigate the mechanism of Rac1 recruitment to the plasma membrane, we searched potential lipid ligands for Rho GTPases by liposome binding and NMR spectroscopy. We found that Rac1 preferentially interacts with phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing bilayers independently of the bound nucleotide. The PS binding site of Rac1 is located at the polybasic region, and prenylation of this motif increases the avidity for its ligand. Conversely, Cdc42 only binds PS when prenylated. Mutational analysis suggests that the PS-PBM interaction is required for Rac1′ subcellular localization and GTP loading, and also triggers Cdc42-GTP formation, phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK1) and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. Thus, PS recognition by Rac1 through its PBM is centrally involved in cell motility and confers non-redundancy in signaling among GTPases proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Recombinant Rho Proteins—Full-length human Rac1, 2, 3, RhoA, and Cdc42 cDNA constructs (UMR cDNA Resource Center) were cloned into a pGEX2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed mutagenesis of Rac1 was performed using the QuikChange exchange protocol (Stratagene). The C-terminal region of Rac1 comprising residues 185-192 was deleted in the truncated form (ΔC Rac1). Purification of all GST fusion proteins from Escherichia coli Rosetta cells (Novagen) on glutathione beads was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). All Rho proteins were also cloned in pBAC-2cp (Novagen) and expressed using the eukaryotic baculovirus, Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) expression system. Prenylated Rho proteins were isolated from the membrane fraction of Sf9 cells by extraction with 0.5% CHAPS (8Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Jouan A. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and purified using Talon beads (Clontech). Purity of all proteins was over 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE gels. All purified proteins were stable in the presence of protease inhibitors as judged by mass spectrometric analysis (data not shown).Liposome Binding Assay—Phospholipids including dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC), dipalmitoyl PS, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and dipalmitoyl PE (Avanti Polar Lipids) were prepared as a lipid film by lyophilization overnight. Lipid films were hydrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol at 1 mg/ml concentration and freeze-thawed 3 times. Large unillamelar vesicles were formed by extruding the lipid through a 0.1-μm filter (Nucleopore track-etch membrane, Whatman) 20 times and used immediately. Recombinant proteins were centrifuged at 44,000 rpm (TLA-45 rotor) for 20 min at 25 °C prior to the assay to remove protein aggregates. Ten micrograms of each of the proteins was added to ∼50 μg of liposomes. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then centrifuged at 44,000 rpm (TLA-45 rotor) for 10 min at 25 °C. Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on Varian INOVA 600 and 500 MHz spectrometers equipped with triple resonance probes with z axis pulse field gradients. 15N-Labeled Rac1 was prepared by growing E. coli cells in M9 minimal media, with 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) as the sole nitrogen source (9Capelluto D.G. Overduin M. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 38: 243-247PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography over a Superdex S75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Titrations with PS/PC (30/70%) or PC (100%) large unillamelar vesicles were performed by recording a series of two-dimensional 1H,15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra of Rac1 (100 μm) at different liposome concentrations. All samples were prepared in 20 mm d11-Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium azide, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Chemical shift assignments of Rac1 were taken from Thapar et al. (7Thapar R. Karnoub A.E. Campbell S.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3875-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Lipid Overlay Assay—Lipid strips were prepared by spotting 1 μl of PS dissolved in chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4) onto Hybond-C extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membrane strips were incubated with 0.2 μg/ml of full-length Rac1 or its mutants in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Following extensive washes with the same buffer, proteins bound to the membrane strips were probed with rabbit anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Detection was carried out using ECL reagent (enhanced chemiluminescence, Pierce).Preparation of Nucleotide Free and Bound Rac1—Proteins were first depleted of nucleotide for 15 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA (6Missy K. Van Poucke V. Raynal P. Viala C. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. Payrastre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30279-30286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Proteins were extensively washed with the same buffer without EDTA in 10-kDa concentrators (Millipore) and incubated in the presence of either GDP or GTPγS (100 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C under gentle agitation. Reactions were stopped with 1 mm MgCl2. Binding to PS was carried out by the lipid-membrane overlay assay.Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—Surface plasmon resonance binding experiments were performed on a BIAcore 3000 instrument using L1 chips coated with ∼0.5 mm mixed PS/PC (30/70%) size-calibrated liposomes. PC liposomes were used as a negative control. Prenylated and non-prenylated Rac1 or its mutants binding experiments were performed in a degassed solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm sodium azide. This buffer was used during equilibration, association, and dissociation phases. Proteins were added to this buffer at the indicated concentrations. Regeneration of the phospholipid bilayer after the dissociation phase was carried out using 20 mm NaOH. The data were globally fit using a two-state reaction model with mass transfer (BIAevaluation 3.0 software).Loading PS into Cell Membranes and Immunofluorescence Staining—Lipid vesicles containing a mixture of 70% PC and 30% PS was prepared by extrusion as described above. Growing and transfection of Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO-K1) cells were performed as described (10Capelluto D.G. Kutateladze T.G. Habas R. Finkielstein C.V. He X. Overduin M. Nature. 2002; 419: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4-8 × 104 CHO-K1 cells/well were grown in 6-well plates in 2 ml of F-12 media with serum. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator until they are 50-80% confluent. For each well transfection, 0.5 μg of DNA (pCS2+(myc)6-tagged Rac1 constructs) and 40 μg of Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) were combined and incubated for 5 h with F-12 media without gentamicin/serum. Following incubation, medium containing twice the normal concentration of serum was added without removing the transfection mixture. Cells were kept in this condition until Rac1 constructs were expressed (about 11 h). Fresh PC or PC/PS liposomes (100 μm) in phosphate-buffered saline were added to myc-tagged Rac1 (or its mutants)-transfected CHO-K1 cells in a culture medium deprived of serum as reported (11Zhao R. Fu X. Li Q. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22609-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, following 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, free lipid vesicles were removed by washing the cells with serum-containing medium. Cells were then incubated in normal medium at 37 °C for 2 h to allow translocation of loaded PS from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet (11Zhao R. Fu X. Li Q. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22609-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To detect intracellular localization of either Rac1 or its mutants, cell were fixed directly with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with Cy3-conjugated anti-myc antibody as described (10Capelluto D.G. Kutateladze T.G. Habas R. Finkielstein C.V. He X. Overduin M. Nature. 2002; 419: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Nuclei and actin stress fibers were detected using 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindol and Alexa 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes), respectively. Fluorescent images were visualized by using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope and captured with a charge-coupled device camera.PAK1 CRIB Pulldown Assay—The activity of both Rac1 and Cdc42 were assessed using the p21-binding domain (CRIB) of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) (12Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Adherent Rac1-transfected CHO-K1 cells (1-2 × 107) were stimulated either with PC or PC/PS liposomes as described above and lysed with cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and a mixture of EDTA-free protein inhibitors) in the presence of 8 μg of GST-PAK1 CRIB for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equivalent amounts of protein in each supernatant were incubated with glutathione beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Bead pellets was then centrifuged for 2 min at 1,000 × g at 4 °C and washed 3 times with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protein inhibitors and twice with the same buffer without Nonidet P-40. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and detected using mouse anti-myc (for Rac1) or rabbit anti-Cdc42 (for Cdc42) antibodies.Immunoblotting Analysis—After transfection with the Rac1 constructs, non-stimulated and PS-stimulated CHO-K1 cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% CHAPS, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaVO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Extracts were sonicated and samples subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with primary antibody (anti-MEK1, anti-phospho-MEK1 (Ser298) from Cell Signaling; anti-c-myc and anti-actin from Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. All horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Detection was performed using ECL reagent.Wound Healing Assay—Untransfected or transfected CHO-K1 cells with the constructs described above were seeded at high density (1.5 × 105 cells on coverslips of 13 mm diameter) and incubated for 24 h until a confluent monolayer was formed. Mytomycin C (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) was then added to inhibit cell proliferation. Wounding was performed by scraping through the cell monolayer with a pipette tip. Afterward, cells were washed with medium. Cells were induced by addition of either PC or PS/PC liposomes as described above, or lipophosphatidic acid (Avanti Lipids) as a positive control. Individual fields of the coverslip were photographed at 20 h after wounding in a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe first investigated whether Rac1, the most representative member of Rho GTPases in eukaryotes, binds phospholipids that are predominantly present at the plasma membrane. We employed a liposome binding assay to identify specific lipid ligands. We found that Rac1 preferentially interacted with PS-containing bilayers as opposed to other anionic phospholipids (Fig. 1A), but no Rac1 association with other phospholipids or sphingolipids was detected (Fig. 1A and data not shown). The binding of Rac1 to PS was independently verified by assaying for vesicle binding using NMR spectroscopy. Stepwise addition of large unillamelar vesicles composed of 30% dipalmitoyl PS and 70% dipalmitoyl PC to the 15N-labeled Rac1 sample caused broadening of the amide NMR signals, indicating the formation of a slower tumbling complex (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, addition of PC alone did not induce comparable line broadening (Fig. 1C), confirming the requirement of Rac1 to bind to PS. Interestingly, addition of equimolar concentrations of the soluble dicaproyl PS (diC6PS) to the Rac1 sample did not induce significant changes in its 15N-1H NMR signals. However, when diC6PS binding was tested above its critical micellar concentration, significant line broadening of the amide signals was evident (data not shown). These observations indicate an essential role for presenting PS within the context of a micellar or bilayer environment for Rac1 interaction. This may be provided in vivo by the plasma membrane, which contains 67% of the total available PS being enriched in the inner leaflet (13Allan D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because Rac1 signals from the plasma membrane, our results suggest that this protein directly interacts with PS-enriched regions where it may direct PS-dependent cellular processes.The preference of Rac1 for PS suggested that other members of the Rho family GTPases might also bind to this phospholipid. However, we found that bacterially expressed forms of Cdc42, RhoA, Rac2, and -3 did not associate with PS under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 2A). Plasma membrane recruitment of Rac1 is driven by both the lipid modification at the Cys189 and the PBM (14del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To study whether isoprenylation influences PS binding, we purified native Rho proteins from Sf9 membranes (15Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Prenylated Rac1 and to a lesser extent Cdc42, but not other Rho proteins, interacted with PS-containing liposomes (Fig. 2A). In addition, substitution of a Ser residue for Cys189 reduced but did not eliminate Rac1 binding to PS liposomes (Fig. 2A). Thus, the interaction of Rac1 with bilayers containing PS benefits from but does not require prenylation.FIGURE 2PS recognition by Rho GTPases. A, Rho proteins from bacteria (upper panel) and Sf9 membranes (lower panel) were incubated with PS/PC liposomes (top). The liposome-bound (as shown) and soluble protein were separated by ultracentrifugation. A similar approach was carried out by the lipid overlay assay (bottom). Strips with different amounts of PS were spotted on Hybond-C extra and different bacterial expressed GST-Rho proteins were tested for binding. B, alignment of the C termini of the human Rho family sequences. The most conserved residues are colored red and the isoprenylated cysteine is boxed. C, binding of the wild type and mutants of Rac1 to PS was monitored by the liposome binding assay (top). Mutants of Rac1 were also tested by the lipid overlay assay (bottom). D, GTP loading of the wild type and PS-binding mutant forms of Rac1 was tested by the PAK1 CRIB pulldown assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rho GTPases share a high level of homology in their amino acid sequence, despite their different effects on cell morphology and signaling. The C-terminal PBM is the most divergent region, with Rac1 presenting the most basic PBM sequence among Rho GTPases (Fig. 2B). Because PS is negatively charged, a likely candidate for direct interaction is the PBM near the CAAX box. Mutation of C-terminal residues Lys186 or Arg187 to Ala of Rac1 in the non-isoprenylated protein significantly reduced PS binding (Fig. 2C). Both mutations combined (K186A/R187A) abolished the interaction, producing the same effect as the deletion of the C-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 2C), and confirming the essential role of these residues in PS binding. Liposome binding assays confirmed the requirement of an intact PBM (Fig. 2C). Mutations at the PBM did not perturb GTP loading as tested by the PAK1 CRIB pull-down assay (Fig. 2D), and did not affect the overall structure (data not shown). Because Lys186 and Arg187 residues are conserved in Rac2, the results suggest that although they are essential, other residues are also involved in PS recognition. By analogy, plasma membrane recruitment of the Ras protein KRas4B is dependent on the net charge of its highly basic PBM (5Williams C.L. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that a general mechanism occurs, in which basic PBM residues, such as Lys183, Lys184, Arg185, Lys186, Arg187, and Lys188 of Rac1, form electrostatic interactions with cluster of anionic phospholipids in the plasma membrane.To explore the regulatory role of GTP, the PS interactions of the nucleotide-bound and depleted Rac1 protein were compared. As shown in Fig. 3A, nucleotide-free Rac1 recognized PS to the similar extent as the nucleotide-bound form. This result was supported by demonstration that Rac1 mutants that are either constitutively activated (Q61L) or dominant negative (T17N) bound PS similarly to the wild type protein (Fig. 3B). This is in agreement with the observation that the GTPase activity of Rac1 is independent of the presence of PS (16Ligeti E. Dagher M.C. Hernandez S.E. Koleske A.J. Settleman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5055-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of the last eight residues in Q61L Rac1 (Q61L ΔC) abrogated PS binding (Fig. 3B), indicating that Rac1 activation is not sufficient for PS association. Likewise, GTP loading appears to be dispensable for the phospholipid binding by the Cdc11 GTPase (17Casamayor A. Snyder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2762-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, recruitment to PS-containing membranes may control the activities of Rac1 through co-localization with its effectors rather than through GTP-dependent regulation of its lipid interactions.FIGURE 3PS binding properties of Rac1. A, nucleotide-free, GDP- and GTP-bound GST-Rac1 proteins were tested for PS binding using the lipid overlay assay. B, Q61L, T17N, ΔC, and Q61L ΔC Rac1 mutants were also tested by the PS-bound lipid overlay assay. C and D, the interactions of isoprenylated wild type and K186A/R187A (C) and non-isoprenylated wild type and K186A/R187A Rac1 proteins (D) with immobilized PS/PC liposomes were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance detection with the resonance units (RU) indicating the bound protein fraction at increasing Rac1 concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The kinetics of the interaction between Rac1 and PS were investigated by surface plasmon resonance detection. All Rac1 proteins displayed reversible binding to immobilized PS/PC liposomes (data not shown). Prenylated Rac1 showed the strongest binding, with an estimated dissociation constant (KD) of 1.1 × 10-8 m (Fig. 3C and Table 1). This affinity is similar to that reported for the PS binding of the Src protein, in which both myristoylation and polybasic regions mediate phospholipid recognition (18Sigal C.T. Zhou W. Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Resh M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12253-12257Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Simultaneous mutation of the two basic residues in Rac1 reduced the affinity over 600-fold, whereas unmodified wild type Rac1 had 177 times lower affinity than prenylated protein (Fig. 3, C and D, and Table 1). The role of the PBM in membrane binding is also seen in Src, because addition of PS to neutral membranes increases its affinity by 3 orders of magnitude (19Buser C.A. Sigal C.T. Resh M.D. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13093-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions of Rac1 with PS-containing bilayers may be synergistic, with electrostatic contacts playing a dominant role.TABLE 1Kinetic analysis of PS recognition by Rac1 Binding constants for the association of Rac1 to PS-containing bilayers as estimated by surface plasmon resonance detection. χ2 is a measure in resonance units of the average standard deviation between the fitted curve and experimental data.

Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). The PBM forms an exposed and apparently unstructured extremity of the folded domain. Based on our CD and NMR data, which do not indicate major structural changes, we propose that the flexible C-terminal element of Rac1 is the primary mediator of the interaction with PS-containing bilayers.Rho proteins regulate the actin cytoskeleton at different levels. Whereas RhoA regulates focal adhesion assembly and actin stress fiber formation, Cdc42 triggers the formation of filopodia and focal complexes in the cell periphery and the direction of the migration; and Rac induces membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation at the plasma membrane upon growth factor stimulation (21Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). In CHO-K1 cells, Rac1 was diffusely distributed in the cytosol (Fig. 4A), in agreement with previous observations (22Lanning C.C. Daddona J.L. Ruiz-Velasco R. Shafer S.H. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44197-44210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The activated Q61L Rac1 induced robust localization to and ruffling of the plasma membrane, although some of the protein was also cytoplasmic (Fig. 4B). In contrast, T17N Rac1 was only cytoplasmic (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, mutation in the PS-binding site of Rac1 induced a punctuate cytoplasmic distribution of the protein, suggesting vesicular compartmentalization (Fig. 4D). This observation is consistent with the proposal that the CAAX motif targets proteins to endomembrane systems, whereas the additional presence of the PBM provides plasma membrane localization (23Choy E.

LANA inhibits p53-induced apoptosis (8Friborg Jr., J. Kong W. Hottiger M.O. Nabel G.J.

In the case of Ets-1, Daxx repressed Ets-1-dependent expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and Bcl-2 (12Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Ets-1 belongs to the Ets family of transcriptional factors, and regulates various gene expressions through binding to a unique motif (GGAA) on their promoters. Ets-1 regulates genes related to angiogenesis: Flt-1/VEGF receptor-1, KDR/VEGF receptor-2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (16Oikawa T. Yamada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 303: 11-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Ets-1 is specifically expressed in lymphoid tissues, endothelial cells (17Sacchi N. de Klein A. Showalter S.D. Bigi G. Papas T.S. Leukemia. 1988; 2: 12-18PubMed Google Scholar), and also in the spindle cells of KS lesion, derived from endothelial origins (18Wernert N. Raes M.B. Lassalle P. Dehouck M.P. Gosselin B.

We therefore examined the role of LANA in interaction between Daxx and Ets-1, and show here a possible new function of LANA on the expression of VEGF receptors. Plasmids—LANA gene was cut from L54 Lambda FIX II vector (NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program), at the EheI site (123743 and 127293 of KSU75698) and inserted into the EcoRV site of pFLAG-CMV-2 expression vector (Sigma) to make an N-terminal FLAG-tagged LANA expression vector, pFLAG-LANA. For in vitro translation/transcription system, the LANA gene from pFLAG-LANA was subcloned between the EcoRI and KpnI sites of pBluescript II KS(+) plasmid after correction of the N-terminal 5 bases using synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′-AATTCATCGATGGCGCCCCCGGGAATGCG-3′ and 5′-CATTCCCGGGGGCTCTATCGATG-3′ (using EcoRI and BsmI sites), to obtain pBluescript-LANA. A series of C-terminal deletion mutants of LANA (L1 to L4) were constructed from pBluescript-LANA using an exonuclease III/mung bean deletion kit (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An N-terminal deletion mutant of LANA (L5) was constructed with pBluescript-LANA by cutting the N-terminal region at EcoRI and PstI sites and joining it with synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′-AATTCATCGATGGAGCCCCTGCA-3′ and 5′-GGGCTCCATCGATG-3′. PFLAG-LANA deletion mutants (pFLAG-LANA-N1 to pFLAG-LANA-C) were constructed with L1–L5 and pFLAG-CMV-2 vector. Full-length and various deletion mutants of the Daxx gene were generated by PCR amplification from cDNA of HeLa cells, subcloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and cloned between the EcoRI and the SalI sites of pcDNA3.1 (–) (Invitrogen) (termed pcDNA-Daxx), pCMV-HA (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.

The constructed plasmids were termed pcDNA-p51Ets-1 and pcDNA-p42Ets-1, respectively. For flow cytometric analysis, the full-length LANA gene from the pBluescript-LANA was cloned between the SacI and SalI sites of pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech), termed pIRES2-LANA-EGFP.

The gel was washed with 150 mm washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF), and eluted with the same buffer containing 200 μg/ml of FLAG peptides. The eluted protein was applied to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver stained. The Coomassie-stained band was cut and treated with lysyl endopeptidase. The extracted peptides were purified using HPLC, and analyzed with a Procise 494 HT Protein Sequencing System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were harvested and lysed with low salt buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 25 μg/ml each of antipain, pepstatin, and leupeptin), then centrifuged to collect the nuclei. The nuclear pellet was lysed with nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm, EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF), and the same volume of distilled water was added. Nuclear extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation either with anti-FLAG antibody (M2), anti-Daxx antibody (sc-7152) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-Ets-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-350). The immune complex was washed with 150 mm washing buffer, resolved in Laemmli's sample buffer and applied to SDS-PAGE. Proteins in gels were transferred to PVDF membrane followed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody (M5, Sigma), anti-Daxx antibody (sc-7152), anti-LANA antibody (Advanced Biotechnologies, Columbia, MD), anti-Ets-1 antibody (sc-350), or anti-HA antibody (Sigma). GST Pull-down Assay—Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Daxx fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified using affinity matrix glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). 35S-labeled LANA was made in vitro with TnT quick-coupled reticulocyte transcription/translation systems (Promega, Madison, WI). GST-Daxx fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with the translated products containing 35S-labeled LANA in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF) at room temperature for 15 min. After washing with washing buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF), proteins adsorbed to the beads were resolved and applied to SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the radioactivity was detected by BAS-1500 (Fuji Film, Tokyo). Immunofluorescence Assay—BCBL-1 cells were attached to slide glasses with a cell concentrator (StatSpin, Norwood, MA). HeLa cells were seeded on chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Campbell, CA). The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS(–), permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-LANA antibody (Advanced Biotechnologies) (diluted to 1:500 or 1:1000) and anti-Daxx antibody (sc-7152) (diluted to 1:100 or 1:200) followed by fluorescent-conjugated second antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rat IgG and Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rabbit IgG, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (diluted to 1:200 each). Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI in mounting oil (Vectashield with DAPI, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunostained cells were analyzed by a confocal laser scanning microscope using a Carl Zeiss LSM510 system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Transcriptional Reporter Assay—293T cells (2 × 105 cells/well) grown in 24-well plates were transfected with pFlt-1-luc, pRSV-β-Gal (for transfection efficiency), and the combination of pcDNA-p51Ets-1, pcDNA-p42Ets-1, pcDNA-Daxx, or pFLAG-LANA, with 2 μl of FuGENE6. Total DNA was adjusted to a constant amount (800 ng). Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed and applied to luciferase assay (Toyo Inki, Tokyo) and β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). Assays were performed in triplicate, and the experiments were repeated three times. Flow Cytometric Analysis—HUVECs transfected with either pIRES2-LANA-EGFP or pIREAS2-EGFP as control, were subjected to FACS Vantage (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) to collect GFP-expressing cells 2 days after transfection. The GFP-expressing cells cultured for 10 days were incubated with anti-Flt-1 or anti-KDR antibody (V4262, V9134, respectively, Sigma) and PE-labeled secondary antibody (R0439, Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA). The cells were analyzed by a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—HUVECs were transfected with either pIRES2-LANA-EGFP or pIREAS2-EGFP using Nucleofector system, and sorted with FACS Aria (Becton Dickinson) to collect GFP-expressing cells. Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), and reverse-transcribed to cDNA with oligo(dT) by Superscript First-strand synthesis system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cDNA was applied to Real-Time PCR using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio Co.) with ABI PRISM7000 (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed at 95 °C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 34 s. The primers were designed using software Primer Express (Applied Biosystems). The forward and reverse primers for Flt-1 were 5′-CCCTTATGATGCCAGCAAGTG-3′ and 5′-CCAAAAGCCCCTCTTCCAA-3′, respectively, and primers for KDR were 5′-CACCACTCAAACGCTGACATGTA-3′ and 5′-CCAACTGCCAATACCAGTGGAT-3′. Primers for Daxx were 5′-GCCCTTCACCACTGTCTTAGAGA-3′ and 5′-GAGACGCCTCCATTGAAGGA-3′. As an internal control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used with primers 5′-GGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTA-3′, and 5′-GGCAACAATATCCACTTTACCAGAGT-3′. The primers for Ets-1 were 5′-CTGCGCCCTGGGTAAAGA-3′ and 5′-CCCATAAGATGTCCCCAACAA-3′. In the case of Ets-1, primers for GAPDH were 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCC-3′ and 5′-TGGGATTTCCATTGATGACAAG-3′. Obtained data were analyzed according to the sequence detector program (Applied Biosystems). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed basically using a kit from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) with some modifications. Cells (5 × 106 cells/assay) were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 5 min for cross-linking, lysed with 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 25 μg/ml each of antipain, pepstatin, and leupeptin), and centrifuged to collect the nuclei. The nuclear pellet was lysed with 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Hcl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS), and sonicated 6 times for 30 s each time. Centrifuged supernatants were then diluted with 1.8 ml of ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and precleared with protein A agarose/salmon sperm DNA. Anti-Ets-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-350), anti-Daxx antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7152), or rabbit IgG (Sigma) as the negative control was added respectively to the supernatant, and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was then incubated with protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA for 1 h at 4°C. The protein A-agarose-conjugated complex was washed, and DNA fragments were eluted and prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. The prepared DNA was resolved in 20 μlofH2O and 2 μl was used for PCR. Primers used were 5′-GGGACCCCTTGACGTCACCA-3′ (corresponding to –90 to –71 of Flt-1 promoter) and 5′-ACCTCGATGAAGAGCAGCCG-3′ (corresponding to –12 to +8 of Flt-1 promoter). Ex Taq polymerase (Takara Bio Co.) was used, and PCR conditions were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1.8% agarose gel. Identification of Daxx as a LANA-binding Protein—To identify host proteins that associate with LANA, we constructed a plasmid expressing FLAG-LANA (N terminus-tagged) to transfect into HeLa cells and established several stable LANA-expressing clones. We cultured one clone of the LANA-expressing cells and prepared nuclear extract. This extract was incubated with anti-FLAG affinity gel (M2-agarose), followed by elution with FLAG peptides. Eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE to detect a prominent 120-kDa band (Fig. 1A). Although there was a 75-kDa band, which was a nonspecific binding protein commonly found with the antibody. We determined the sequences of the N-terminal 10 residues of the 120-kDa protein, which revealed the protein to be Daxx. To confirm the identification, the nuclear extract (each 500 μg of protein) was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody to apply to immunoblotting with anti-Daxx antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, anti-Daxx antibody recognized a band of 120 kDa. These results indicated that Daxx is a cellular binding protein of exogenously expressed LANA in the HeLa cell. To confirm LANA-Daxx interaction in a physiological context, we immunoprecipitated with anti-Daxx antibody from nuclear extracts of BCBL-1 cells, a PEL cell line infected with KSHV. LANA was co-immunoprecipitated with Daxx as well (Fig. 1C). This result suggested that LANA formed a complex with Daxx in KSHV-infected cells. Colocalization of LANA and Daxx in the Nuclei of KSHV-infected Cell Line BCBL-1—Next we examined the localization of LANA and Daxx in BCBL-1 by immunofluorescence microscopic assay (Fig. 2A). LANA gave a characteristic speckled staining pattern in nuclei of the cells (Fig. 2A, panel b), Daxx also showed some speckles in the nuclei (Fig. 2A, panel c). The merged image indicated that LANA considerably co-localized with Daxx in the nuclear dots (Fig. 2A, panel d). We also investigated the localization of Daxx using HeLa cells (Fig. 2B). LANA gave fine patchy staining in the nucleus (Fig. 2B, panel f), which is a typical observation in the absence of KSHV genome (Fig. 2B, panel g). The parental HeLa cells showed diffused staining of Daxx throughout the cell (Fig. 2B, panel c). In contrast, Daxx appeared to accumulate in the nuclei of the LANA-expressing cells (used in Fig. 1) (Fig. 2B, panel g). LANA and Daxx largely localized in the nucleus of the HeLa cells (Fig. 2B, panel h). We performed biochemical fractionation using three independent clones of LANA-expressing HeLa cells and examined cellular localization of Daxx by Western blotting. The results indicated that the amount of Daxx in the nuclear fraction increased as LANA expression increased, although total amounts of Daxx were comparable in these HeLa clone cells (data not shown). A Region Containing the Acidic-rich Domain in LANA Is Required for Binding with Daxx—To determine the interacting domain of LANA with Daxx, we constructed a series of LANA deletion mutants (Fig. 3A), which were translated in vitro and subjected to pull-down assay with GST-Daxx. As shown in Fig. 3B, full-length LANA was pulled down with GST-fused full-length Daxx, indicating direct interaction between LANA and Daxx. Three N-terminal mutants of LANA (L1–L3) bound with GST-Daxx, but the shortest N-terminal LANA (aa 1–261) (L4), and C-terminal LANA (aa 496–740) (L5) failed (Fig. 3B). We constructed mammalian expression plasmids, LANA-N (aa 1–564), LANA-C (aa 496–1162), LANA-N1 (aa 1–260), LANA-N2 (aa 1–320), LANA-N3 (aa 1–344), and LANA-ΔAD (with aa 322–493 deleted) (Fig. 3A). These plasmids were co-transfected with pcDNA-Daxx into 293T cells, and the nuclear extracts were analyzed. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Daxx antibody and Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody indicated that Daxx formed a complex with full-length LANA and LANA-N, and weakly with LANA-N3, but not with the other LANA fragments (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results suggested that aa 320–344 of LANA, which contains many aspartic acids and glutamic acids, were required for binding with Daxx. A Central Domain of Daxx Is Required to Interact with LANA—To determine the critical region of Daxx for binding with LANA, a series of GST-fused deletion mutants of Daxx (Fig. 4A) were produced in E. coli, and applied to pull-down assay with full-length 35S-labeled LANA. The GST-fused full-length Daxx (G1) and the Daxx-deleted aa 500–740 (G2) bound to LANA, but deleted aa 440–740 (G3) failed (Fig. 4B). From the in vitro result above, the region of aa 440–500 in Daxx was thought to be critical for the binding. However, GST-fused aa 440–625 of Daxx (G4) did not bind (Fig. 4B), nor did any other mutants, although weak binding was observed with GST-fused aa 1–270 of Daxx (G8)(Fig. 4B). We constructed a series of deletion mutants of N-terminal HA-tagged Daxx (H2–H5), and co-expressed them with pFLAG-LANA in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody showed that all the mutants except H5 bound to LANA (Fig. 4C, left two panels). The acidic-rich region (aa 440–500) of Daxx was not critical to the binding with LANA in cells, not corresponding with the results in vitro. To examine contribution of N terminus of Daxx, a series of mutant Daxx expression vectors with N-terminal deletion (D3–D5) and a deletion mutant without central region aa 271–509 (D2), were constructed and transiently expressed in 293T cells. Experiments of immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotting with anti-Daxx antibody (sc-7152, that recognizes the C terminus of Daxx) showed that D3 bound firmly with LANA, but D4 did very little (Fig. 4C, right two panels). The first paired amphipathic helix (PAH), aa 63–108 appeared to be of some importance for the binding, although HA-tagged Daxx without PAH1 (H4) bound LANA. These results indicated that a central region aa 63–440 within Daxx, containing two paired PAHs and its following 200 aa, was important for the binding with LANA in cells. LANA Inhibited Daxx-mediated Repression of Ets-1-dependent VEGF Receptor 1 (Flt-1) Gene Expression—To examine the role of Daxx in Kaposi's sarcoma, we focused on Ets-1 transcription factor. It was reported that Daxx interacts with Ets-1 to repress Ets-1-dependent transcriptional activity of MMP-1 and Bcl-2 (12Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). On the other hand, as a characteristic feature of KS, it is known that VEGF and its receptors, Flt-1 and KDR (VEGF receptor-1 and -2, respectively), are highly expressed in KS (20Masood R. Cesarman E. Smith D.L. Gill P.S. Flore O. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 23-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There are several Ets-1 motifs in Flt-1 and KDR promoters to regulate the expression (26Wakiya K. Begue A. Stehelin D. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30823-30828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (27Kappel A. Schlaeger T.M. Flamme I. Orkin S.H. Risau W. Breier G. Blood. 2000; 96: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the effect of Daxx on Ets-1-dependent Flt-1 expression. We co-transfected a luciferase reporter plasmid pFlt-1-luc driven by Flt-1 promoter, an Ets-1 expression vector, and a Daxx expression vector into 293T cells, to perform luciferase assay. Transcriptional activity on Flt-1 increased depending on the amount of Ets-1 plasmid, although the effect of p51-Ets-1 was quite weak. Daxx evidently repressed Ets-1-dependent activation (Fig. 5A). p51 and p42 are two human variants of the Ets-1 molecule. It is reasonable that the activity of p51-Ets-1 is lower than p42-Ets-1 because p42-Ets-1 lacks exon VII, the internal transcriptional regulatory domain (24Koizumi S. Fisher R.J. Fujiwara S. Jorcyk C. Bhat N.K. Seth A. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 675-681PubMed Google Scholar). This result is similar to the case of MMP-1 and Bcl-2 expression (28Krithivas A. Young D.B. Liao G. Greene D. Hayward S.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 74: 9637-9645Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As we observed the repressive activity of Daxx on Ets-1-dependent Flt-1 expression, we examined the effect of LANA on the Daxx-mediated repression with p42Ets-1. Co-transfection with a LANA expression plasmid dose-dependently reactivated the transcriptional activity repressed by exogenous Daxx (Fig. 5B, 4 and 5), although LANA slightly activated it in the absence of exogenous Daxx (Fig. 5B, 7). These results suggested that LANA inhibited the repression vi"

As the temperature is decreased, the spin fluctuations, manifested by a sharp enhancement of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/ T 1 , continue to grow down to the lowest temperature of 66 millikelvin. The observed divergent behavior of 1/ T 1 signals a gapless spin excitation mode and is a hallmark of canted antiferromagnetic order. Our data demonstrate the realization of a two-dimensional system with planar broken symmetry, in which fluctuations do not freeze out when approaching the zero temperature limit."
https://openalex.org/W2070446531,"In budding yeast, Gin4, a Nim1-related kinase, plays an important role in proper organization of the septin ring at the mother-bud neck, a filamentous structure that is critical for diverse cellular processes including mitotic entry and cytokinesis. How Gin4 kinase activity is regulated is not known. Here we showed that a neck-associated Ser/Thr kinase Elm1, which is important for septin assembly, is critical for proper modification of Gin4 and its physiological substrate Shs1. In vitro studies with purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that Elm1 directly phosphorylates and activates Gin4, which in turn phosphorylates Shs1. Consistent with these observations, acute inhibition of Elm1 activity abolished mitotic Gin4 phosphorylation and Gin4-dependent Shs1 modification in vivo. In addition, a gin4 mutant lacking the Elm1-dependent phosphorylation sites exhibited an impaired localization to the bud-neck and, as a result, induced a significant growth defect with an elongated bud morphology. Thus, Elm1 regulates the septin assembly-dependent cellular events by directly phosphorylating and activating the Gin4-dependent pathway(s).

In eukaryotic organisms, events that regulate the cell cycle are highly coordinated with the assembly of cytoskeletal structures, and this coordination is critical for proper cell division and proliferation. Recent studies in budding yeast have provided new insights as to how assembly of cytoskeletal structures such as septin rings at the bud-neck is monitored to regulate the timing of mitotic entry, thus providing a mechanism of linking the cytoskeletal assembly with cell cycle machinery. However, the molecular pathway(s) leading to the regulation of septin ring assembly is not clearly understood. Septins comprise a conserved family of proteins that was identified first in yeast and subsequently in various other fungi and animals (for review, see Refs. 1Longtine M.S. Bi E.

In budding yeast, all five septins (Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, Cdc12, and Shs1) localize to the presumptive bud site before bud emergence and remain at the mother-bud neck until after cytokinesis (3Haarer B.K.

Studies with temperature-sensitive mutants in the CDC3, CDC10, CDC11, or CDC12 locus showed that inactivation of any of these gene products results in severe defects in cytokinesis and cell morphogenesis, yielding elongated, connected cells with multiple nuclei at the restriction temperature (7Adams A.E.M. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recombinant Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, and Cdc12 proteins purified from bacterial cells are sufficient to form filaments in vitro (8Frazier J.A. Wong M.L. Longtine M.S. Pringle J.R. Mann M.

Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Unlike the four septins, however, loss of SHS1 function results in only milder bud-elongation and cytokinetic defects (6Mino A. Tanaka K. Kamei T. Umikawa M. Fujiwara T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys.

A large body of evidence suggests that proper organization of the septin cytoskeleton at the bud-neck is critical for timely entry into mitosis (14Barral Y. Parra M. Bidlingmaier S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 15Edgington N.P. Blacketer M.J. Bierwagen T.A. Myers A.M. Mol. Cell.

It has been shown that defects in septin filament assembly lead to the accumulation of Swe1 (budding yeast Wee1 homolog) that negatively regulates Cdc28 (Cdk1 homolog) by phosphorylating it at Tyr19. As a result, these cells possess a diminished Clb-Cdc28 activity and exhibit elongated bud morphologies because of a failure to switch from apical growth to isotropic growth. Interestingly, three Nim1-related kinases (Hsl1, Gin4, and Kcc4) that localize to the bud-neck in a septin-dependent manner are collectively required for proper down-regulation of Swe1 (14Barral Y. Parra M. Bidlingmaier S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), suggesting that these kinases play a critical role in linking the assembly of proper septin organization to mitotic entry. It has been shown that septins (Cdc11 and Cdc12) directly activate Hsl1 (18Hanrahan J. Snyder M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and activated Hsl1 functions in concert with its binding protein Hsl7 to recruit Swe1 to the bud-neck for degradation (19Theesfeld C.L. Zyla T.R. Bardes E.G. Lew D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3280-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gin4 and Kcc4 do not appear to play a direct role in Swe1 recruitment but promote septin assembly (14Barral Y. Parra M. Bidlingmaier S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), which ultimately leads to Hsl1-Hsl7-dependent Swe1 localization and degradation. A recent report proposed that Gin4 associates with Shs1 and this step facilitates the mitosis-specific oligomerization and activation of Gin4 (13Mortensen E.M. McDonald H. Yates III, J. Kellogg D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2091-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, whether Gin4 is directly phosphorylated and regulated by an upstream kinase(s) has not been clarified.

Also, the absence of a PAK kinase homolog Cla4 or acute inhibition of cdc28-as activity resulted in hypophosphorylation and inactivation of Gin4 (13Mortensen E.M. McDonald H. Yates III, J. Kellogg D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2091-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Tjandra H. Compton J. Kellogg D. Curr.

In this study, we demonstrated that Elm1, but not Cla4 or Cdc28, directly phosphorylates and activates Gin4, which in turn phosphorylates Shs1 in vitro. Consistent with these observations, acute inhibition of Elm1 activity drastically diminished the mitotic Shs1 phosphorylation and sumoylation in a Gin4-dependent manner. Our data presented here demonstrate the existence of a novel Elm1-dependent Gin4-Shs1 regulatory pathway that is important for proper septin assembly. Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Complete deletions of ORFs for GIN4, KCC4, and HSL1 were generated by PCR-based one-step gene disruption. Strains bearing the C-terminal tags at the GIN4, KCC4, HSL1, and SHS1 loci were generated by transforming the corresponding strains with PCR fragments derived from corresponding tagging templates. Appropriate tagging was confirmed by genomic PCR and protein expression. The resulting strains grew similar to the parental strains, suggesting that the tagged proteins are functional.TABLE 1Strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceAS79MATa elm1-as bar1ΔD. R.

To generate pKL2025 or pKL2143, a StuI DNA fragment bearing either wild-type or kinase-inactive form of ELM1 was cloned into pKL1969 digested with MscI and StuI. Similarly, to construct pKL2051, pKL2260, pKL2044, and pKL2145, a SmaI fragment bearing wild-type or kinase-inactive form of GIN4 (pKL2051 or pKL2260, respectively) or HSL1 (pKL2044 or pKL2145, respectively) was inserted into pKL1969 digested with MscI and StuI. Construction of pKL2045 and pKL2327 was carried out by inserting a XhoI-PvuII fragment of wild-type or kinase-inactive KCC4 into pKL1969 digested with XhoI and StuI. The elm1(K117R) mutation was derived from pCK77 (24Koehler C.M. Myers A.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas hsl1(K10R) was derived from YCpLG-HSL1(K110R)-HA3 (pJT1382) (25Cid V.J. Shulewitz M.J. McDonald K.L. Thorner J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1645-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The gin4(K48A) and kcc4(K50M) mutations were generated by a PCR-based mutagenesis. Plasmids pBlueBacHis2B-HA-CLA4-Flag and the corresponding kinase-inactive cla4(K594R) construct were reported previously (26Sakchaisri K. Asano S. Yu L.R. Shulewitz M.J. Park C.J. Park J.E. Cho Y.W.

To generate plasmid pKL3489, a PstI fragment containing K48A mutation was prepared from pM-90 (27Iwase M. Toh-e A. Cell Struct. Funct. 2004; 29: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and then ligated into pM-87 (27Iwase M. Toh-e A. Cell Struct. Funct. 2004; 29: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) digested with PstI. Plasmid pKL3756 was generated by mutating the Elm1-dependent phosphorylation sites using site directed mutagenesis. The resulting gin4 mutant (gin4(Δ13P)) bears mutations in the Elm1-dependent phosphorylation sites (namely, S389A, S430A, S431A, S460A, T462A, S465A, T539A, S540A, S617A, S639A, S683A, S750A, S453Δ; S453 was deleted because S453A mutation induced protein instability). Plasmid pKL2261 was generated by inserting a HindIII-XbaI fragment containing SHS1 into pGEX-KG (28Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) digested with the corresponding enzymes. Growth Conditions and Media—Yeast cell culture and transformations were carried out by standard methods (29Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics.

For cell cycle synchronization, MATa cells were arrested with 2 μg/ml of α-mating pheromone (Sigma) for 2 h at 30°C. To inhibit Elm1 activity prior to α-factor release, elm1-as cells were treated with 5 μm 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(1-napthylmethyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) (1NM-PP1; a gift of K. Shokat, University of California, San Francisco, CA) 30 min before releasing from the α-factor block. Inhibition of the kinase activities of cdc28-as1, elm1-as, or cla4-as3 was achieved by treating the cells with 0.5, 5, or 25 μm 1NM-PP1, respectively. For some experiments indicated, cells were first arrested in S or M phase by treating them with 200 mm hydroxyurea or 15 μg/ml nocodazole, respectively, and then treated with 1NM-PP1 while maintaining the arrest.

GST-Shs1 and MBP-Clb2 were prepared from E. coli BL21 bearing pGEX-KG-SHS1 and MC1061 bearing pMAL-CLB2 (a gift of R. Deshaies, Caltech, Pasadena, CA), respectively. MBP-Clb2 bound to amylose resin (New England Biolab, Beverly, MA) was eluted with 10 mm maltose (Sigma) before reconstituting with equal amount of purified GST-Cdc28/His6-Cks1/Cak1 complex on ice for 30 min. Kinase Assays and Two-step Reactions—Kinase assays were carried out as described previously (30Asano S. Park J.E. Sakchaisri K. Yu L.R. Song S. Supavilai P. Veenstra T.D. Lee K.S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2194-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The resulting samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE as indicated, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the incorporated 32P was detected by autoradiography. The protein bands were excised from the dried gels, and incorporated 32P was measured by liquid scintillation counter. To carry out two-step reactions, the first reaction with indicated immobilized recombinant proteins was carried out in a kinase mixture (TBMD) (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) containing 500 μm ATP. The reaction mixtures were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times to remove remaining ATP and then subjected to the second labeling reaction in TBMD containing 5 μm ATP (10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP; 1Ci = 37 GBq). To facilitate reactions for bead-bound proteins, continuous agitation was provided. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and then subjected to either 8% low bis-SDS-PAGE (96:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide mixture) or 10% normal SDS-PAGE for autoradiography. Confocal Microscopy—Cells expressing either wild-type or mutant forms of a functional GIN4-GFP fusion (27Iwase M. Toh-e A. Cell Struct. Funct. 2004; 29: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were cultured overnight and arrested with nocodazole for 3 h before fixing with 3.7% formaldehyde. Fluorescent images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal scan head mounted on a Nikon Optiphot microscope with a 60× planapochromat lens. Each image is the Kalman-averaged product of ∼4 scans generated by using LaserSharp software. Elm1 is a bud-neck-associating serine/threonine kinase that is critical for proper septin organization and cytokinesis. To investigate the relationship between Elm1 and other bud-neck-associating kinases such as Nim1-related kinases (Gin4, Kcc4, and Hsl1), polo kinase homolog Cdc5, and PAK homolog Cla4, we carried out in vitro kinase assays in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP using recombinant proteins purified from Sf9 cells. Wild-type Elm1 efficiently autophosphorylated and generated slow migrating forms (Fig. 1A, lane 1), whereas a catalytically inactive elm1(K117R) mutant did not (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The wild-type, but not the kinase-inactive Gin4(K48A), exhibited a moderate level of autophosphorylation activity under the same conditions (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, the addition of wild-type Elm1, but not the corresponding kinase-inactive form, into the reaction mixture markedly enhanced (∼6-fold) the autophosphorylation activity of Gin4 (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6) and increased the amount of slow migrating Gin4 forms (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6 in the Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) panel, right). Elm1 also phosphorylated the kinase-inactive Gin4(K48A) mutant significantly (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 8) and activated the wild-type Gin4 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). These observations suggest that Elm1 directly phosphorylates and activates Gin4. Interestingly, Elm1 activity was also mildly enhanced (∼2-fold) in the presence of wild-type Gin4 (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6), raising the possibility of mutual activation between these two enzymes. Under the same conditions, Elm1 activated Kcc4 weakly (∼2–3-fold) (Fig. 1C). However, Elm1 failed to enhance the autophosphorylation activity of Hsl1 (Fig. 1D) and also did not detectably phosphorylate Hsl1 purified from bacterial cells (data not shown). In addition, Elm1 did not appear to phosphorylate and activate Cla4 (supplemental Fig. S1A) or Cdc5 (data not shown). These observations suggest that Elm1 directly phosphorylates and activates Gin4 and, perhaps, Kcc4 but not other kinases. A previous report showed that loss of ELM1 results in hypophosphorylation and inactivation of Gin4 (20Sreenivasan A. Kellogg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7983-7994Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Loss of ELM1 also leads to a diminished Kcc4 and Hsl1 modification in vivo (21Bouquin N. Barral Y. Courbeyrette R. Blondel M. Snyder M. Mann C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1435-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since elm1Δ cells grow slowly and exhibit severely elongated bud morphologies with a cytokinetic defect (20Sreenivasan A. Kellogg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7983-7994Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), some of the elm1Δ defects could have been induced indirectly as a result of accumulated growth and morphological defects in the continuous absence of Elm1. Thus, we re-examined the modification of Gin4, Kcc4, and Hsl1 using an analog-sensitive (as) elm1 allele (elm1-as) (22Sreenivasan A. Bishop A.C. Shokat K.M. Kellogg D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6327-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that confers an acute sensitivity to the cell-permeable ATP-binding site inhibitor, 1NM-PP1 (31Bishop A.C. Shah K. Liu Y. Witucki L. Kung C. Shokat K.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To this end, elm1-as strains bearing GIN4-HA3, KCC4-Myc5, or HSL1-Myc9 were first arrested in G1 by α-factor treatment. These strains were then treated with either Me2SO as control or 5 μm 1NM-PP as inhibitor to acutely inhibit Elm1 kinase activity 30 min before being released into nocodazole-containing medium in the continuous presence of Me2SO or 1NM-PP1 (Fig. 2A). In control cells, Gin4 became hyperphosphorylated and progressively retarded in migration as large budded cells accumulated (Fig. 2B). In contrast, inhibition of elm1-as by 1NM-PP1 greatly diminished the Gin4 phosphorylation in both small budded (50-min sample) and large budded (100-min sample) cells (Fig. 2B). Unlike the previous report (22Sreenivasan A. Bishop A.C. Shokat K.M. Kellogg D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6327-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), inhibition of elm1-as did not significantly delay the appearance of small budded cell populations, and the rate of generating large budded cells was indistinguishable between Me2SO and 1NM-PP1 treatments under these conditions (Fig. 2B). These observations suggest that the diminished Gin4 phosphorylation in these cells is not likely due to a delayed cell cycle. In line with the previous observation (21Bouquin N. Barral Y. Courbeyrette R. Blondel M. Snyder M. Mann C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1435-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of elm1-as induced a mild, but reproducible, reduction in the slow migrating Kcc4 species in small budded cell population (note the slight difference in the migration patterns of Kcc4 between Me2SO- and 1NM-PP1-treated cells at a 50-min time point; Fig. 2C). Inhibition of elm1-as also altered the level of Hsl1 phosphorylation significantly (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data suggest that Elm1 activity is required for proper modification of Gin4 and Hsl1 and to a lesser extent Kcc4 in vivo. Mortensen et al. (13Mortensen E.M. McDonald H. Yates III, J. Kellogg D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2091-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have shown that Gin4 phosphorylates Shs1 in vitro and is required for proper modification of Shs1 in vivo. Thus, we closely examined whether the Elm1-dependent Gin4, Kcc4, and/or Hsl1 modification is important for proper modification of Shs1. To examine this possibility, various elm1-as SHS1-HA3 mutants were first arrested with α-factor, treated with either control Me2SO or 1NM-PP1 for 30 min and then released into nocodazole-containing medium in the continuous presence of Me2SO or 1NM-PP1 (Fig. 3A). As described previously (13Mortensen E.M. McDonald H. Yates III, J. Kellogg D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2091-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), Shs1 was detected as a phosphorylated doublet in α-factor-arrested cells and became additionally modified to slow migrating forms (arrowheads) as cells accumulated in mitosis (Fig. 3B, left panel). The two much slower migrating forms (closed arrowheads) closely resembled those of the sumoylated Shs1 species that have been previously characterized (32Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Interestingly, inhibition of elm1-as greatly diminished Shs1 phosphorylation in mitotic cells and eliminated its sumoylation (Fig. 3B, left panel). Furthermore, loss of GIN4 almost completely eliminated the mitotic Shs1 modifications to a level similar to those after inhibiting elm1-as (compare between Me2SO-treated gin4Δ samples and the 1NM-PP1-treated control samples in Fig. 3B). In contrast, loss of either KCC4 or HSL1 did not significantly influence the Shs1 modifications (Fig. 3B, right panel), even though both appeared to function downstream of Elm1 either directly or indirectly (see Fig. 2). These data strongly suggest that Elm1 is critical for the mitotic modification of Shs1 and that Gin4, but not Kcc4 and Hsl1, is required for this event. Since Elm1 phosphorylates and activates Gin4 in vitro, and the Elm1-dependent Gin4 pathway is critical for Shs1 modification in vivo, we next examined whether Elm1-dependent Gin4 activation is important for subsequent Gin4-dependent Shs1 phosphorylation in vitro (the in vitro Elm1-dependent Kcc4 activation was not further investigated, because loss of KCC4 did not alter the Shs1 modifications in vivo). To examine this possibility, we carried out sequential, two-step phosphorylation reactions using purified recombinant proteins (because we failed to purify sufficient soluble enzymes, both bead-bound Elm1 and Gin4 enzymes were used with continuous agitation). To activate Gin4 in the first reaction (activation reaction), either a wild-type or kinase-inactive form of Gin4 was incubated with wild-type Elm1 with excess ATP. After washing out the remaining ATP from the resulting reaction mixtures, both GST-Shs1 and histone H1 (HH1; an in vitro substrate of Gin4) were added into the reaction mixture and then further incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (labeling reaction) (Fig. 4A). In the absence of Elm1, Gin4 both autophosphorylated itself and transphosphorylated Shs1 and HH1 (Fig. 4, B and C, lane 3). Correlating with the increased autophosphorylation activity, preincubation of wild-type Gin4 with Elm1 enhanced the ability of Gin4 to phosphorylate Shs1 and HH1 ∼3.5-fold (Fig. 4, B and C, lane 5). However, the kinase-inactive gin4(K48A) (27Iwase M. Toh-e A. Cell Struct. Funct. 2004; 29: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) failed to phosphorylate Shs1 and HH1 even after preincubation with Elm1 (Fig. 4, B and C, lane 6), suggesting that the wild-type Gin4 activity is responsible for the Shs1 and HH1 phosphorylation. Elm1 was not able to phosphorylate Shs1 and HH1 significantly under these conditions (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 1 and 2). Thus, the enhanced incorporation of 32P into Shs1 and HH1 after preincubating Gin4 with Elm1 is a result of the Elm1-dependent Gin4 activation. To directly examine the physiological significance of Elm1-dependent Gin4 phosphorylation, we first phosphorylated purified, kinase-inactive, gin4(K48A)-Flag with Elm1 in vitro in the presence of 500 μm ATP. The Elm1-phosphorylated gin4(K48A) band (which migrates a little slower than the band generated by the kinase-inactive Elm1) was excised for mass spectrometry after generating tryptic peptides. These analyses revealed nine definitive and four potential Elm1-dependent Gin4 phosphorylation sites (Table 3). Close inspection of the determined phosphorylation sites suggests that Elm1 prefers to phosphorylate Ser/Thr in a Φ-S/T motif (Φ represents hydrophobic amino acid residues). Several of the potential phosphorylation sites were also followed by Pro or a positively charged residue (Table 3). These observations allowed us to predict the Elm1-dependent phosphorylation site within a given trypti"

The Etnk2-/- mice exhibited a maternal-specific intrauterine growth retardation phenotype that resulted in a 33% reduction in litter size and frequent perinatal death. Histological analysis of pregnant Etnk2-/- females showed that fetal development failed at the late stage of pregnancy in a significant percentage of embryos because of the appearance of extensive placental thrombosis.

The CDP-ethanolamine (Etn) pathway begins with ethanolamine kinase (EtnK; ATP:ethanolamine phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.82) followed by CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase and terminates with a diacylglycerol phosphotransferase (1Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The second route to PtdEtn is via the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (1Vance J.E. Vance D.E.

Based on this property, both the ChoK and EtnK reactions were considered for some time to be carried out by the same enzyme(s). However, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are two kinases with opposite specificities. The yeast ChoK has a specific activity 3.6-fold higher for Cho compared with Etn, whereas EtnK has a specificity constant 2-fold higher for Etn compared with Cho (9Kim K. Kim K.H. Storey M.K. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14857-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The discovery of the Drosophila EtnK encoded by the eas gene established the existence of Etnspecific kinases with negligible ChoK activity in higher eukaryotes (10Pavlidis P. Ramaswami M. Tanouye M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 23-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A defect in the Drosophila EtnK results in a bang-sensitive paralytic phenotype, indicating the potential importance of EtnK to neuronal function (10Pavlidis P. Ramaswami M. Tanouye M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 23-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and EtnK is also implicated in fly development (11Pascual A. Chaminade M. Préat T. Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Mice and humans have two related EtnK genes (see Fig. 1). Human ETNK1 has robust EtnK activity, but ChoK activity is not detected (12Lykidis A. Wang J. Karim M. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2174-2179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Expression of ETNK1 in cell culture selectively increases Etn uptake and phosphorylation and PtdEtn synthesis (12Lykidis A. Wang J. Karim M. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2174-2179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A second gene (ETNK2) is identified as a cDNA related to ETNK1 (12Lykidis A. Wang J. Karim M. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2174-2179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although bioinformatics analysis suggests that ETNK2 encodes EtnK-specific kinase activity, there are no biochemical data to support this conclusion. ETNK2 is the most highly expressed of the two isoforms and is found primarily in the liver and reproductive tissues of humans (12Lykidis A. Wang J. Karim M. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2174-2179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A role for EtnK2 in testicular maturation is suggested by the pattern of Etnk2 expression in developing mouse testis (13Hurley T.M. McClive P.J. Sarraj M.A. Sinclair A.H. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus, EtnKs can be distinguished from ChoKs, and a number of possible roles from the literature are suggested for mammalian EtnKs.This investigation establishes mouse EtnK2 as a specific EtnK that is expressed most highly in liver and reproductive tissues. Characterization of phospholipid synthesis in the absence of EtnK2 expression in mice pointed out its dispensability or redundancy in most physiologic processes and cell types. Homozygous disruption of the Etnk2 gene had little effect on liver phospholipid metabolism, neural development, or testicular function. However, a non-redundant role for EtnK2 was indicated by a maternal-specific failure to support late embryonic development, resulting in reduced perinatal size and survival and suggesting compromised placental function. This phenotype was similar to that of the β2-glycoprotein I null mouse, which lacks the principal target antigen for anti-phospholipid antibodies associated with recurrent pregnancy loss and fetal growth restriction in women (14Robertson S.A. Roberts C.T. van Beijering E. Pensa K. Sheng Y. Shi T. Krilis S.A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 10: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is thought that the β2-glycoprotein I protein complexes with anionic phospholipids and that these complexes can become antigenic and underlie a novel class of autoimmune disorders called antiphospholipid syndrome. Anti-PtdEtn antibodies in particular are prevalent in antiphospholipid syndrome patients with mid-to-late pregnancy loss (15Sugi T. Matsubayashi H. Inomo A. Dan L. Makino T. J. Obstet. Gynaecol. Res. 2004; 30: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Etnk2-/- phenotype also resembles the Rho-associated kinase II (ROCK-II) null mouse, which lacks expression of the Rho-associated kinase II isoform, and both male and female embryos exhibit extensive thrombus formation in the placenta, leading to intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight pups (16Thumkeo D. Keel J. Ishizaki T. Hirose M. Nonomura K. Oshima H. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Narumiya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5043-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). ROCK-II is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates cytoskeletal proteins upon binding to the active form of the Rho GTPase (17Nakagawa O. Fujisawa K. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Nakao K. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). RhoA cycling from the active GTP form to the inactive GDP form can be regulated by the lateral movement of PtdEtn at the cell surface during late stage cytokinesis (18Yasui Y. Amano M. Nagata K. Inagaki N. Nakamura H. Saya H. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Emoto K. Inadome H. Kanaho Y. Narumiya S. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37901-37907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These new data in this work characterize mammalian EtnK2 for the first time and suggest a link between maternally derived PtdEtn and embryonic signaling across the placental interface.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of the Mouse Etnk2 cDNA and Construction of the Expression Vector—The expressed sequence tag data base was searched using the human ETNK1 sequence (12Lykidis A. Wang J. Karim M. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2174-2179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two mouse expressed sequence-tagged clones (AI098609 and AA261067) that encoded amino acid 25 through the termination stop codon were identified. The 554-bp EcoRI-NsiI fragment of AI098609 was ligated to the 4352-bp EcoRI-NsiI sequence of AA261067 in the pT7T3D-Pac vector, and these fragments together made up the 3′-end of the cDNA. The 5′-end of the cDNA was amplified from a mouse kidney MarathonReady cDNA kit (Clontech) using forward primer 5′-ACCACTCCCACTCTCTCTCAGG and reverse primer 5′-CATACACCCGGACCAACACG and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector. The 5′-end was sequenced and then subcloned into pcDNA3.1 after XbaI-BamHI digestion. The 3′-end was ligated with the 5′-end in the expression vector at the AfeI-HindIII sites, resulting in plasmid pPJ184, which carried the full-length mouse Etnk2 cDNA. The entire cDNA sequence was confirmed in both directions.Transcript Analysis—A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (OriGene) loaded with equal amounts of tissue poly(A)+ mRNA was hybridized and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled random-primed probes prepared using the homologous 512-bp NsiI-ScaI fragment of the mouse Etnk2 cDNA (12Lykidis A. Wang J. Karim M. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2174-2179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as template. Probes were made using random primers and [32P]dCTP.Quantitative Real-time PCR—The abundance of Etnk2 mRNA was measured by real-time PCR as described previously (20Zhang Y.-M. Marrakchi H. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15558-15565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers and probes were synthesized at the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The primers and probes were used to assess expression of Etnk2 mRNA (see Table 1) and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene (control reagent kit, Applied Biosystems). Amplification and detection of the real-time PCR products were performed with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mixes (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence system (Applied Biosystems). Experiments were performed with three replicas for each cDNA, and negative reverse transcriptase and no-template controls were run for each reaction on the same 96-well plate. All of the real-time values were compared using the CT method, in which the amount of target mRNA was normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene (ΔCT).TABLE 1Primer sequences used to characterize the Etnk-/- targeting construct to genotype the knock-out mice and the primers and probes used to quantitate mRNA levels by real-time PCRPrimerSequencePCR genotyping primersFP15′-TACCACTCTCAATGCTCCGACTFS15′-CTCCTGGGACCCGTAATGACCRN15′-GAGGATCTCGTCGTGACCCARP15′-CCCTCTCAGATCTCTATACCTGGRS15′-ATGCATCTTATGCCAGAGCGRN35′-CTCGTGCTTTACGGTATCGCReal-time Etnk2 PCR primers and probeEtnK2-Fw5′-CTGTTTCTCCATGTCCTCTTGCTEtnK2-Rv5′-CCCAGGGTGCCCAACTCEtnK2-Probe5′-CCCAGGGTGCCTTTCTGCCT Open table in a new tab Cell Culture—Human kidney 293T cells (a gift from Suzanne Baker, Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Inc.), 2 mm glutamine, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Transient transfection of pPJ184 expressing EtnK2 protein, pAL10 expressing human ETNK1, or the pcDNA3.1 empty vector control was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were scraped from the dishes 48 h after transfection after washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. Cell pellets were stored frozen at -80 °C.Construction of the Mouse Etnk2 Replacement Vector—In general, the Neo resistance gene cassette was inserted into exon 3 of the gene to replace 66 bp. A negative selection cassette encoding the diphtheria toxin antigen was added at the 3′-end of the mouse genomic DNA insert. Using the mouse Etnk2 cDNA sequence, the genomic Etnk2 sequence (AC034108) was identified in the NCBI mouse genomic data base. The short and long arms of the construct were obtained by PCR using the Advantage® genomic PCR kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's directions. Mouse W9.5 embryonic stem (ES) cell genomic DNA was the template; oligonucleotide primers 5′-TGTCCGCGGCACCAGTCAACCCACATAAGTC (including a SacII site) and 5′-GCATCTAGAGTGGATGGTGTGAATCTTAGCC (including a XbaI site) yielded a 1903-bp product, and 5′-CGTATCGATGATGAGATCAGTCCCAGGTATAGAGA (with a ClaI site) and 5′-TGGGTCGACTGGTTGCCAATGTCAAATGCCT (with a SalI site) yielded a 5752-bp product. PCR products were purified using a High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Applied Science) and then incubated at 72 °C for 20 min after the addition of dATP and Taq polymerase (Promega). This ensured the presence of an A overhang for the subsequent cloning into the pCR2.1 vector. The sequences of the long and short arms were confirmed for 650 bases at each end. The plasmid pMAK6 (pBluescript SK+ containing the diphtheria toxin antigen cassette; a gift from Dr. James Ihle, Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital) was used as the base vector. A 1.2-kb Neo cassette (a gift from Dr. James Ihle) was inserted into the ClaI and XbaI sites, followed by the 1889-bp SacII-XbaI short arm fragment and the 5739-bp ClaI-SalI long arm fragment. The final plasmid construct was linearized with SacI prior to transfection into mouse AB2.2 ES cells (Lexicon Genetics).Identification of Gene-targeted ES Cell Clones—ES cells were grown on mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts carrying resistance to neomycin (a gift from Peter McKinnon, Department of Genetics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital). More than 200 clones resistant to G418 were selected; genomic DNA was isolated and screened by PCR using primers FP1, RP1, and RN1 (see Table 1). ES cells with one chromosome that had undergone homologous recombination with the replacement vector were identified by a 3366-bp PCR product compared with a 2261-bp product from the wild-type allele obtained using primers FP1 and RP1. Insertion of the Neo cassette was confirmed by a 2479-bp product obtained with primers FP1 and RN1.Derivation of Etnk2-disrupted Mice—An ES cell colony containing the recombined Etnk2-disrupted locus was injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, which were then implanted into pseudopregnant female mice at the Transgenic Core Facility of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Male offspring with 75-90% agouti color (the coat color contributed by the ES cells) were bred with C57BL/6J females. Pups that were 100% agouti, indicating germ line transmission, were screened. Tail clips from weanling animals were digested overnight at 55 °C in buffer containing 0.25 mg/ml proteinase K, 0.2 m NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mm EDTA, and 0.2% SDS. The DNA was extracted using an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and the upper phase was precipitated with 0.8 volume of cold isopropyl alcohol. The DNA precipitate was washed with 80% ethanol and dissolved in 50-100 μl of water at 50 °C for 30 min. The DNA was then subjected to multiplex PCR analysis using primers FS1, RS1, and RN3 (Table 1), which yielded a 325-bp fragment for the recombinant allele and a 225-bp fragment for the wild-type allele. Etnk2+/- heterozygotes were mated, and the progeny were screened by the same methodology. Homozygous mouse pups were identified at an ∼25% ratio and bred together to maintain the colony. Mice were maintained on regular Purina rodent chow 5013 at a room temperature of 72 ± 1 °F and a room humidity of 50 ± 10% with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, with the dark cycle starting at 6:00 p.m.Tissue Histology—Mouse tissues were analyzed using both paraffin sections and frozen sections. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intracardially perfused with 0.01 m PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissues (including liver, ovary, uterus, brain, retina, and cochlea) were dissected out and incubated overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. For frozen sections, tissues were immersed in 30% sucrose for 24-48 h at 4 °C and frozen on dry ice in embedding medium (Fisher). Sixmicrometer-thick sections were cut and stored at -20 °C until used. For paraffin sections, mouse tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and processed by dehydration in 70% ethanol followed by xylene. Tissues were infiltrated and embedded in paraffin, cut into 4-μm sections, mounted on microscope slides, and stored at room temperature until used. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and viewed under an Olympus BX41 microscope.Six-micrometer-thick cryosections were used for programmed cell death analysis. Sections were stained based on reactivity determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) using the ApopTag peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (catalog no. S7100, Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In addition, active caspase-3 activity was detected using an antibody that specifically interacts with the cleaved activated fragment of caspase-3. Immunohistochemistry was performed after permeabilization of the cells with 0.2% Triton and blocking in 2.5% horse serum in PBS. Sections were incubated overnight with a 1:200 dilution of a polyclonal antibody against cleaved caspase-3 (Abcam) at 4 °C. The next day, sections were washed with PBS and incubated at room temperature with an Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. After washing and mounting, the sections were viewed under an Olympus BX41 fluorescence microscope.Hormone Determinations—Serum samples were stored at -20 °C until analysis. Coat-A-Count radioimmunoassays (Diagnostic Products Corp.) were performed to quantitatively measure the amounts of progesterone and estradiol in serum samples according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 μl of duplicate serum samples or known concentrations of hormone standards were added to tubes coated with antibody. 125I-Labeled progesterone or estradiol was then added to each tubes and vortexed. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 3 h, decanted, and air-dried. Tubes were counted for 1 min in a Beckman γ-counter.EtnK and ChoK Assays—Frozen 293T cell pellets transfected with plasmid pPJ184 or pPJ96 (12Lykidis A. Wang J. Karim M. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2174-2179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or with a control empty vector were thawed on ice and incubated for 1 h in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice. The cells were disrupted by sonication (6 × 30 s) in a cup horn (Microsonix Sonicator 3000), and the particulate fraction was removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and EtnK or ChoK activities were determined essentially as described previously (12Lykidis A. Wang J. Karim M. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2174-2179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Porter T.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 414-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A flash-frozen tissue slice was thawed on ice, and the wet weight was determined. Two volumes of lysis buffer were added to ∼50 mg, and the tissue was broken in a glass homogenizer by 20 strokes and set on ice for 30 min, followed by 15 more strokes. The lysate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube prior to assay. The standard assays contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2 ,10mm ATP (pH 7.0), and 20 μm [1,2-14C]ethanolamine hydrochloride (specific activity of 110 mCi/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO) or 40 μm [1,2-14C]choline chloride (specific activity of 50 mCi/mmol, 0.1 mCi/ml exchanged into water; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min when using transfected cells or for 30 min when using the mouse tissue lysates. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 0.5 m Na3EDTA, and the tubes were vortexed and placed on ice. Next, 40 μl of each sample were spotted on pre-adsorbent Silica Gel G thin-layer plates, which were developed with 2% ammonium hydroxide and 95% ethanol (5:1, v/v). Phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine were identified by co-migration with standards, and product formation was quantitated using a Bioscan imaging system. Protein was determined according to the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).Phospholipid Determinations—Flash-frozen mouse tissues were thawed and weighed, and ∼50 mg were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar). The organic phase containing lipid was concentrated under nitrogen and resuspended in 400 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1). A 1-μl aliquot was loaded onto a thin-layer silica gel rod, developed first in ether, dried, and then developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:25:8:3). Lipid mass was detected by flame ionization using an Iatroscan instrument (Iatron Laboratories, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with PeakSimple software (SRI Instruments), and peaks were identified by co-migration with authentic standards. PtdEtn, phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), cholesterol, or triglyceride mass was calculated by consulting standard curves for detector response prepared with dioleoyl-PtdEtn, egg PtdCho, cholesterol, or triolein (Matreya, LLC), respectively.Phospholipid Molecular Species Profiling by Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry analysis was performed in the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital using a Finnigan™ TSQ® Quantum triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray ion source. Samples were introduced in 50:50 (v/v) chloroform/methanol and 1% formic acid via static nanoelectrospray using EconoTips™ (New Objective, Inc., Woburn, MA). The instrument was operated in the positive ion mode using parent ion scanning for PtdCho and neutral loss scanning for PtdEtn corresponding to the loss of their respective phosphoryl head groups. Ion source parameters were as follows: spray voltage, 1000 V; capillary temperature, 270 °C; and capillary offset, 35 V. Tube lens offset was set by infusion of the polytyrosine tuning and calibration solution (Thermo Electron Corp.) in the electrospray mode. Acquisition parameters for PtdCho were as follows: scan range, m/z 600-900; scan time, 0.3 s; product mass, m/z 184.1; collision energy, 40 V; peak width Q1 and Q3, 0.7 full-width half-maximum; and Q2 collision-induced dissociation gas, 0.5 millitorr. Acquisition parameters for PtdEtn were as follows: scan range, m/z 600-900; scan time, 0.3 s, neutral loss mass, m/z 141.0; collision energy, 30 V; peak width Q1 and Q3, 0.7 full-width half-maximum; and Q2 collision-induced dissociation gas, 0.5 millitorr. Instrument control and data acquisition were performed with Finnigan™ Xcalibur™ software (Version 1.4 SR1, Thermo Electron Corp.).Preparation and Radiolabeling of Hepatocytes—Whole livers of 2-4-month-old mice were harvested and rinsed in ice-cold buffer A (each liter contained 3.9 g of NaCl, 0.5 g of KCl, 24 g of HEPES, and 2.7 g of glucose, with the pH adjusted to 7.6 with NaOH). Each liver was chopped with a Vibratome tissue chopper at a setting of 0.5 mm and resuspended in 20 ml of erythrocyte buffer (15 ml of buffer A plus 5 ml of erythrocyte lysis buffer (Qiagen Inc.)) in a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask, gently mixed in the buffer, and allowed to settle. The supernatant was carefully poured off and discarded, and the procedure with the erythrocyte buffer was repeated twice. The tissue pieces were then resuspended in 30 ml of digestion buffer (buffer A plus 0.7 g/liter CaCl2, 0.5 mg/ml type I collagenase, and 6 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease) and incubated in a water bath shaker at 120 rpm for 20 min at 37 °C. The tissue pieces were allowed to settle on ice, and the supernatant was transferred to a centrifuge tube. The tissue pieces were resuspended in another 30 ml of digestion buffer; the procedures were repeated twice; and the three supernatants were combined. The cell suspension from the supernatants was filtered through Spectra/Mesh nylon (41 μm; Fisher), and liver cells in the filtrate were centrifuged down at 100 × g for 2 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was resuspended in wash buffer (each liter contained8gof NaCl, 0.35 g of KCl, 0.16 g of MgSO4, 0.18 g of CaCl2, 2.4 g of HEPES, and 15 g of bovine serum albumin, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) containing 10% (v/v) erythrocyte lysis buffer and centrifuged down three times.Mouse liver cells were resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin to a density of ∼1 × 107 cells/ml. For each labeling experiment, 75 μl of the cell suspension were used. The cells were labeled with 2 μm [3H]Etn or [3H]serine (50 Ci/mmol). After a 6-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS. The cells were lysed by sonication in 50 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaF. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and aliquots were removed for determination of protein and total [3H]pantothenate incorporated into the cell. The identity of the intracellular metabolites was determined by fractionating the cell lysates by thin-layer chromatography on Silica Gel G plates developed with 2% ammonium hydroxide and 95% ethanol (5:1) using the standards described previously (24Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 926-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sections (0.5 cm) were scraped from the plate, and the radioactivity was quantitated in 3 ml of scintillation fluid using a liquid scintillation counter.RESULTSSequence and Distribution of the Murine Etnk2 cDNA—In our previous work with ETNK1, a second human gene called ETNK2 was detected by a bioinformatic analysis (12Lykidis A.

https://openalex.org/W2156261558,"Induction of transcription requires an ordered recruitment of coregulators and specific combinations of histone modifications at the promoter. Occurrence of histone H4 arginine (Arg) 3 methylation by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) represents an early promoter event in ER (estrogen receptor)-regulated gene activation. However, its in vivo significance in ER signaling and the prerequisites for PRMT1 recruitment to promoters have not been established yet. We show here that endogenous PRMT1 is a crucial and non-redundant coactivator of ER-mediated pS2 gene induction in MCF7 cells. By investigating promoter requirements for PRMT1 recruitment we find that the patient SE translocation (SET) protein, which was reported to protect histone tails from acetylation, associates with the uninduced pS2 gene promoter and dissociates early upon estrogen treatment. Knockdown of SET or trichostatin A (TSA) treatment causes premature acetylation of H4 and abrogation of H4 Arg3 methylation at the pS2 gene promoter resulting in diminished transcriptional induction. Thus, SET prevents promoter acetylation and is a prerequisite for the initial acetylation-sensitive steps of pS2 gene activation, namely PRMT1 function. Similar to pS2 we identify lactoferrin as a PRMT1-dependent and TSA-sensitive ER target gene. In contrast, we find that the C3 gene, another ER target, is activated in a PRMT1-independent manner and that SET is involved in C3 gene repression. These findings establish the existence of PRMT1-dependent and -independent ER target genes and show that proteins guarding promoter hypoacetylation, like SET, execute a key function in the coactivation process by PRMT1.

Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The PRMT family members share a highly conserved catalytic domain, which transfers the methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine onto the guanidino nitrogens of arginines giving rise to mono- and dimethylation. PRMT1, -4, -5, and -6 have been demonstrated to activate or repress transcription in a methyltransferase dependent manner. PRMTs are recruited to promoters by their interaction with distinct transcription factors (2Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R.

Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 10Strahl B.D.

Biol. 2001; 11: 996-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In search of the molecular function of histone modifications, it was suggested that different combinations of such modifications constitute a “histone code,” which determines chromatin structure and transcriptional activity (11Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6586) Google Scholar, 12Turner B.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Histone modifications are either specifically recognized or provoke release of chromatin bound proteins (13Margueron R. Trojer P. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of proteins that inhibit histone modifications by binding and masking the unmodified histone tails adds further complexity to the histone code. The INHAT (inhibitor of acetyltransferase) complex consisting of TAF-I (template activating-factor I) α, TAF-Iβ/SET, and the phosphoprotein pp32 interacts with unmodified histone tails in vitro and inhibits gene activation by keeping the tails inaccessible to HATs (histone acetyltransferases) (14Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). TAF-Iβ was originally identified as a factor that stimulates adenoviral replication (15Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Ui M. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10582-10587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was found to be identical with the patient SE translocation (SET) oncoprotein (16Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K.

SET and pp32 have additionally been shown to associate with HDAC (histone deacetylase) activity and to repress nuclear hormone receptor (NR)-regulated transcription in reporter gene assays (14Seo S.B.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Induction of transcription requires a highly ordered and sequential recruitment of coactivator proteins and specific combinations of histone modifications at the promoter, including arginine methylation. A cyclic assembly of such a series of coactivator complexes was illustrated for ER (estrogen receptor) target genes (18Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 19Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). During transcriptional activation there is cross-talk between histone-modifying enzymes, e.g. PRMT1 and PRMT4 synergize with CBP/p300 in NR- and p53-activated gene expression (4An W. Kim J. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2004; 117: 735-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 20Lee Y.H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell.

H4 Arg3 methylation by PRMT1 precedes histone acetylation in retinoic acid receptor and p53 signaling (4An W. Kim J. Roeder R.G.

Biol. 2005; 25: 5648-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Consistently, PRMT1 prefers unmodified to preacetylated histones as in vitro substrates (3Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) and facilitates histone acetylation in vitro and in vivo (4An W. Kim J. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2004; 117: 735-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 23Huang S. Litt M. Felsenfeld G. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Subsequently, H3 acetylation by CBP/p300 enables PRMT4-mediated promoter methylation (21Daujat S. Bauer U.M. Shah V. Turner B. Berger S. Kouzarides T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2090-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although these findings suggest a chronological order of activating promoter events, in which PRMT1 is the first factor to be recruited followed by CBP/p300 and subsequently by PRMT4, it has recently been reported that during cyclic recruitment of coactivator complexes PRMT1 and PRMT4 are alternatively present and might exhibit redundant functions (19Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar, 24Metivier R. Reid G. Gannon F. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). By studying the role of PRMT1 in ER-regulated transcription we show that endogenous PRMT1 exerts a non-redundant function in pS2 expression and is required for full gene induction. We reveal that hypoacetylation of the pS2 promoter mediated by SET is a prerequisite for the acetylation-sensitive coactivation by PRMT1. Despite its role in preventing histone acetylation SET acts here as a transcriptional activator. In case of the ER target complement factor 3 (C3), which is not regulated by PRMT1, but seems to require acetylation for its transcription, SET is involved in gene repression. These findings establish the existence of PRMT1-dependent and -independent ER target genes and elucidate the molecular requirements for PRMT1 recruitment. Cell Line—MCF7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Before hormone treatment MCF7 cells were grown for 3-4 days in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 5% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal calf serum following addition of 200 nm 17β-estradiol (E2; Sigma) for the indicated times. For trichostatin A treatment, hormone-deprived cells were incubated in the presence of 500 nm TSA (Sigma) or solvent Me2SO for the indicated times. Antibodies—The following antibodies were employed: anti-PRMT1 was from Upstate Biotechnology (07-404) and Abcam (ab3768), anti-SET (KM1720), which does not recognize TAF-Iα (25Nagata K. Saito S. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Furuya A. Kusano A. Hanai N. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), anti-H4 Arg3 Me was from Abcam (ab412), anti-H4 Ac was from Upstate Biotechnology (06-866), anti-ERα (HC-20) and anti-p300 (C-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, rabbit IgG was from Sigma, and anti-β tubulin was from Chemicon. Anti-PRMT6 was generated in rabbits against amino acids 346-362 of human PRMT6. Plasmids—pBS/U6 short hairpin (sh) GFP and pBS/U6 shPRMT1 corresponding to nt 977-998 of human PRMT1 were recently described (6Rezai-Zadeh N. Zhang X. Namour F. Fejer G. Wen Y.D. Yao Y.L. Gyory I. Wright K. Seto E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The HA-tag full-length SET cDNA construct was described (25Nagata K. Saito S. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Furuya A. Kusano A. Hanai N. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Short Interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Transfections—siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon for targeting human PRMT1, human SET, and GFP, respectively. As TAF-Iα and SET differ only in their small N-terminal region, siSET targets both splice variants. The siRNA sequences are (sense strand indicated): siPRMT1, 5′-CGUGUAUGGCUUCGACAUG-3′; siSET, 5′-AUAUAACAAACUCCGCCAA-3′; and siGFP, 5′-GCAAGCUGACCCUGAAGUU-3′. MCF7 cells were hormone-starved for 24 h, and subsequently siRNA duplexes (100 nm final concentration) were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) under hormone-free conditions for 3 days. Afterward cells were treated without or with E2 and harvested for RNA, protein, or chromatin preparation. For transfection of plasmids into MCF7 cells, FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) was used. Stable MCF7 transfectants were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin (Cayla) 48 h post-transfection. Individual clones were expanded in selection medium and analyzed by Western blot and RT-PCR. Reverse Transcription (RT)—Total RNA from MCF7 cells was isolated using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 2 μg of RNA were applied to RT by incubation with 0.5 μg oligo(dT)12 primer and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). CDNA was analyzed by quantitative PCR (QPCR). Chromatin Immmunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Cells were cross-linked in the presence of 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and harvested after twice washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet of a 145 cm2-dish was resuspended in lysis buffer I (5 mm PIPES, pH 8, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation (at 4 °C, 1200 rpm, 5 min), resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer II (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Subsequently chromatin was fragmented by sonication seven times for 10 s on ice at 40% amplitude (Branson Sonifier W-250-D) to obtain an average fragment length of 0.5-1 kb. Following centrifugation (at 4 °C, 15,000 rpm, 15 min), 10% of chromatin was de-cross-linked and kept as input. From the remaining chromatin ∼200 μg were used per immunoprecipitation reaction and subjected to preclearing with protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), which beforehand was incubated at 4 °C for at least 2 h with 200 μg of bovine serum albumin and 100 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA/1 ml of 50% bead slurry. Immunoprecipitations with 4 μg of antibody (or alternatively 5-8 μl when the Ig concentration was unknown) were performed overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected with 20 μl of 50% slurry of protein A/G beads per reaction at 4 °C for 2 h. Precipitates were serially washed once with 1 ml of wash buffer I (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 5% succhrose), wash buffer II (50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100), twice with wash buffer III (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40), and once with TE buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA). Chromatin was eluted with 300 μl of elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS) for 45 min at room temperature. All ChIP buffers contained a protein inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). Cross-linking was reversed overnight at 65 °C. Eluted DNA was purified with QIAquick columns (Qiagen) and subjected either to standard PCR analysis for the presence of pS2 (region nt -159 to nt -463) and GAPDH promoter fragments using previously described primers (27Saitoh S. Wada T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 66: 1958-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) or to QPCR analysis. ChIP assays have been repeated at least three times in independent experiments with the same results, and presented data sets show reproducible and representative results. QPCR—Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green (Bioline) and the Mx3000P real-time detection system (Stratagene). For RT-QPCR we used the following primers: human pS2, 5′-GCCTTTGGAGCAGAGAGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAAAACAGTGGCTCCTGGCG-3′ (reverse); human GAPDH, 5′-AGCCACATCGCTCAGACAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCCAATACGACCAAATCC-5′ (reverse); human C3, 5′-AGGATGGAAAGCTGAACAAGCTCTGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGACAGCTGAACCTTGACCAGTC-3′ (reverse); human lactoferrin, 5′-TAAGGTGGAACGCCTGAAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCATTTCTCCCAAATTTAGCC-3′ (reverse). All amplifications were performed in triplicates using 1 μl of cDNA per reaction. The triplicate mean values were calculated according to the ΔΔCt quantification method (29Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25432) Google Scholar) using the GAPDH gene transcription as reference for normalization. Standard deviation was calculated from the triplicates. Error bars are accordingly indicated. Gene transcription was expressed as fold increase in mRNA level, whereas the mRNA level in uninduced control (siGFP or Me2SO-treated) cells was equated 1, and all other values were expressed relative to this. The represented RT-QPCR assays were reproduced at least three times in independent experiments with the same results and representative data sets are shown. For ChIP QPCR we used the following human pS2 primer: 5′-GTTGTCACGGCCAAGCCTTTT-3′ (reverse) and 5′-AGGATTTGCTGATAGACAGAGACGAC-3′ (forward). All amplifications were performed in triplicates using 2 μl of immunoprecipitated chromatin per reaction. Mean values were normalized for the amount of input chromatin and the IgG control immunoprecipitations and expressed as fold increase in promoter association, whereas the enrichment in uninduced control cells was equated 1. Functional Importance of Endogenous PRMT1 in ER Signaling—To assess the functional importance of PRMT1 in ER-regulated transcription of the pS2 gene, we used siRNA to specifically knock down PRMT1 expression in MCF7 cells, an estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell line. Cells were seeded in hormone-free medium and were subsequently transfected with siRNA. Western blot analysis of uninduced MCF7 cells revealed a suppression of the endogenous PRMT1 level by transfection of siRNA targeting PRMT1 mRNA (named siPRMT1) compared with siGFP (control), whereas PRMT6 expression was unaffected (Fig. 1A). To analyze ER-regulated transcription siRNA-treated cells were induced with E2 for 5, 15, and 45 min and harvested for RNA preparation. RT-quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) revealed that the uninduced and E2-induced transcriptional activity of pS2 was diminished upon siPRMT1 transfection compared with siGFP transfection (Fig. 1B). Reduction of the endogenous PRMT1 transcript was verified in the siPRMT1-treated cells, and furthermore it was shown that transcript levels of GAPDH and ERα remained unaffected by E2 or siPRMT1 (supplemental Fig. 1). We obtained identical results using the recently published pBS/U6 shPRMT1 vector system (6Rezai-Zadeh N. Zhang X. Namour F. Fejer G. Wen Y.D. Yao Y.L. Gyory I. Wright K. Seto E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which targets a different region of the PRMT1 mRNA (Fig. 5A). These findings demonstrate that endogenous PRMT1 is a non-redundant coactivator of ER-mediated pS2 gene activation and is required for full gene induction.FIGURE 5Lactoferrin and pS2 are PRMT1-dependent ER target genes, whereas C3 is a PRMT1-independent ER-target gene. A, MCF7 cells were stably transfected with pBS/U6 shGFP plasmid or pBS/U6 shPRMT1 plasmid. ShGFP and shPRMT1 expressing cell lines were hormone-starved and subsequently left either uninduced or induced with E2 for 15 and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h. Total RNA was analyzed by RT-QPCR using primers for the pS2, lactoferrin, and C3 gene. B, hormone-starved MCF7 cells were pretreated for 2 h with solvent Me2SO (DMSO) or TSA. In the following E2 was added as in A. Total RNA was examined by RT-QPCR using primers for the pS2, lactoferrin, and C3 gene. C, hormone-starved MCF7 cells were treated with siGFP or siSET. Afterward cells were induced as in A. Total RNA was analyzed by RT-QPCR using primers for the pS2, lactoferrin, and C3 gene.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether this transcriptional effect in PRMT1 knockdown cells correlates with loss of H4 Arg3 methylation at the pS2 gene promoter, we perfomed ChIP analysis of siPRMT1-treated and control cells following E2 induction. Chromatin was subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against ERα, PRMT1, Arg3-methylated H4, and control IgG. We analyzed the precipitated chromatin by standard PCR for the presence of pS2 promoter fragments including the ERE (estrogen response element) (28Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Promoter occupancy of ERα, PRMT1, and Arg3-methylated H4 was hardly detectable in uninduced cells but increased 15 min post-induction and remained constant at the 30-min time point in control cells (Fig. 1C) in agreement with previous studies (18Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 19Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). These events coincided with transcriptional activation (Fig. 1B). As expected, siPRMT1 transfection resulted in a decrease of E2-induced PRMT1 recruitment and strongly reduced levels of H4 Arg3 methylation 15 and 30 min post-induction (Fig. 1C). Binding of ERα was not affected by PRMT1 knockdown. These results show that PRMT1 is the major H4 Arg3 methyltransferase at the E2-induced pS2 promoter and that loss of H4 Arg3 methylation coincides with alleviated gene induction. Association of Endogenous SET with the Uninduced pS2 Gene Promoter—As H4 Arg3 methylation is attenuated by histone acetylation in vitro (3Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), we reasoned that proteins, which prevent premature hyperacetylation of histones, could be a prerequisite for early acetylation-sensitive steps of ER-mediated gene activation, like PRMT1 recruitment and activity. INHAT subunits protect histone tails from HATs and associate with HDAC activity (30Kutney S.N. Hong R. Macfarlan T. Chakravarti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30850-30855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The SET protein was recently shown to interact with the unliganded ERα and to release upon hormone binding (17Loven M.A. Muster N. Yates J.R. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous observations (17Loven M.A. Muster N. Yates J.R. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) we found endogenous TAF-Iα weakly expressed on transcript and protein level in MCF7 cells, whereas the splice variant β (SET) was strongly expressed (data not shown). Thus, in the following we focused on SET and investigated whether the endogenous protein associates with the pS2 gene promoter by ChIP analysis. Cells were kept in hormone-free conditions and subsequently left either untreated or stimulated for 60 min with E2. Chromatin was precipitated with anti-ERα, anti-SET, or without IgG (control) and analyzed by standard PCR for the presence of GAPDH (27Saitoh S. Wada T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 66: 1958-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and pS2 promoter fragment. SET was bound to the uninduced pS2 promoter and became undetectable upon hormone induction (Fig. 2A). As expected, ERα weakly associated with the uninduced pS2 promoter and was recruited following addition of E2. These changes were specific for pS2 upon E2 treatment, since no enrichment of the active, non-hormone-responsive GAPDH promoter was observed. To elucidate the kinetics of this SET displacement, we performed ChIP analysis of a shorter E2 time course. Chromatin was precipitated with antibodies against ERα, SET, PRMT1, p300, and control IgG. Standard PCR analysis of the pS2 promoter revealed recruitment of ERα and PRMT1 within 15 min post-induction, whereas SET detached from the pS2 promoter within this time (Fig. 2B). Promoter association of p300 was weak at the uninduced pS2 promoter and gradually enhanced throughout the time course (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the view that PRMT1 precedes p300 recruitment and activity. Together these results indicate that endogenous SET associates with the uninduced pS2 promoter and detaches early after hormone induction. The Role of SET in Transcriptional Activation of pS2—To further clarify the role of SET in pS2 gene transcription, we depleted its endogenous expression by siRNA transfection in MCF7 cells, as shown on protein level in Fig. 3A. pS2 transcription in SET knockdown and control cells was analyzed by RT-QPCR. SET reduction lowered the basal pS2 transcript level and abolished E2-induced pS2 transcription (Fig. 3B). Depletion of the SET transcript in this E2 time course was verified (supplemental Fig. 2). Transcript levels of ERα and GAPDH remained unaffected (supplemental Fig. 2). MCF7 cells stably transfected with HA (hemagglutinin)-tag SET (Fig. 3C) revealed an enhanced E2-induced pS2 transcription (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that SET contributes to transcriptional activation of pS2. To study the function of SET at the pS2 promoter in more detail we performed ChIP assays of siGFP and siSET treated cells using antibodies against ERα, SET, Arg3-methylated H4 and acetylated H4. As demonstrated by QPCR, SET was bound to the pS2 promoter in the absence of E2 and detached within 15 min of induction in control cells. In contrast, its promoter association was greatly reduced in SET knockdown cells (Fig. 3E). Promoter binding of ERα was not affected by SET knockdown, neither in uninduced cells nor after 15 min of E2 induction (Fig. 3F). SET depletion caused increased promoter acetylation in both uninduced and"
https://openalex.org/W2082617067,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a large variety of pre-ribosomal factors have been identified recently, a number of which are still of unknown function. The essential pre-ribosomal 30-kDa protein, Nsa2, was characterized as one of the most conserved proteins from yeast to human. We show here that the expression of the human orthologue TINP1 complements the repression of NSA2 in yeast. Nsa2 was co-purified in several pre-ribosomal complexes and found to be essential for the large ribosomal subunit biogenesis. Like several other factors of the pre-60 S particles, the absence of Nsa2 correlated with a decrease in the 25 S and 5.8 S ribosomal RNA levels, and with an accumulation of 27 SB pre-ribosomal RNA intermediates. We show that Nsa2 is a functional partner of the putative GTPase Nog1. In the absence of Nsa2, Nog1 was still able to associate with pre-ribosomal complexes blocked in maturation. In contrast, in the absence of Nog1, Nsa2 disappeared from pre-60 S complexes. Indeed, when ribosome biogenesis was blocked upstream of Nsa2, this short half-lived protein was largely depleted, suggesting that its cellular levels are tightly regulated.

Ribosome biogenesis is a highly conserved process among eukaryotes and results in the synthesis of functional small and large ribosomal subunits, necessary for the translation of mRNAs into proteins in the cytoplasm. This essential process is tightly regulated; indeed, in exponentially growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, it accounts for about 60% of the metabolic effort (1Warner J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar), whereas it is almost completely turned off during the stationary phase. The pathway begins with the transcription by RNA polymerase I of a 35 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor and of the 5 S rRNA by RNA polymerase III. This transcription, together with the nuclear import of ribosomal proteins, pre-ribosomal factors, and small nucleolar RNAs, is responsible for the self-assembly of the nucleolus (reviewed in Ref. 2Dundr M. Misteli T. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), a region of the nucleus specialized in the production of ribosomes. Association of ribosomal proteins and pre-ribosomal factors with nascent pre-rRNAs gives birth to a 90 S pre-ribosomal complex, which undergoes various steps of maturation, first in the nucleolus, then in the nucleoplasm, and finally in the cytoplasm after export through the pores of the nuclear envelope (for a review of the whole pathway, see Refs. 3Venema J.

Along this maturation, the 90 S complex separates into a pre-60 S complex, which will generate the large ribosomal subunit containing mature 25 S, 5.8 S, and 5 S rRNAs, and a pre-40 S complex, which will generate the small ribosomal subunit containing 18 S rRNA. A large number of factors are necessary for the correct modification, cleavage, and processing of pre-rRNAs, the positioning of ribosomal proteins, and the export of the pre-60 S and pre-40 S particles toward the cytoplasm. More than 100 factors associated with pre-60 S complexes (pre-60 S factors) have been identified to date, a number of which remain to be characterized (4Fromont-Racine M. Senger B. Saveanu C.

Others are annotated as putative enzymes based on sequence similarities, but their exact role in the biogenesis is still unclear. Among these factors, a set of putative GTPases is required at various steps of the maturation of the large subunit, namely nuclear-nucleolar Nog1, Nog2, Nug1, and cytoplasmic Lsg1 (10Bassler J.

As putative GTPases, these proteins are believed to participate in the control of biogenesis; they may play a part as proofreaders of the correct maturation of pre-ribosomal particles at a precise step. In a previous work, we demonstrated that the physical and functional partners Nog1 and Rlp24 are required for adequate processing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) 3The abbreviations used are: ITS2, internal transcribed spacer 2; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazol; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; ORF, open reading frame; TAP, tandem affinity purification; TEV, nuclear inclusion A protein of tobacco etch virus; YPD, yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose; snRNA, small nuclear RNA. in 27 S pre-rRNAs, located between the 5.8 S and 25 S mature rRNAs (13Saveanu C.

Here, we have focused on a partner of Nog1, the essential pre-60 S factor, Nsa2 (for Nop seven-associated 2), which was found associated with pre-60 S complexes in tandem affinity purifications (6Gavin A.C.

It contains an S8 domain, named after the Rps8 archaeal and eukaryotic ribosomal proteins, which could be involved in protein-RNA interactions. This factor appears to be one of the most conserved proteins in the eukaryotic kingdom (15Stanchi F. Bertocco E. Toppo S. Dioguardi R. Simionati B. Cannata N. Zimbello R. Lanfranchi G. Valle G. Yeast. 2001; 18: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Sequence conservation correlates with function conservation, as we show here that the human orthologue TINP1 is able to complement the repression of NSA2 in yeast. The absence of Nsa2 results in impaired 60 S levels in yeast cells (14Harnpicharnchai P. Jakovljevic J. Horsey E. Miles T. Roman J. Rout M. Meagher D. Imai B. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J.

We show in this work that this protein is required for the progression of the pre-60 S complexes through the ITS2 cleavage and processing steps. Additionally, the protein levels of Nsa2 appear to be tightly regulated and depend on proper 60 S biogenesis upstream in the metabolic pathway. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Oligonucleotides—The yeast strains used in the present study are listed in Table 1. Chromosomal deletions or gene fusions were generated by homologous recombination using PCR products to transform MGD353-13D, BMA64, or BY4742 strains (16Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Details concerning these constructs may be provided upon request. Disrupted strains in the BY4742 background, with the KanMX4 marker, came from the Euroscarf collection of deletion strains (17Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). Plasmids for two-hybrid assays were obtained by Gateway cloning in pAS2ΔΔ and pACTIIst destination vectors. Thermosensitive alleles of NOG1 (nog1ts) were generated by mutagenic PCR (18Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). They were expressed in the centromeric vector pFL36cII under control of the natural NOG1 promoter and terminator sequences. The plasmid pFL46sII-PNSA2-TINP1 was obtained by cloning the complete TINP1 open reading frame (ORF) from the TINP1 cDNA in the multicopy plasmid pFL46sII, under control of the natural NSA2 promoter and terminator sequences.

The transformants were grown on solid synthetic minimal medium lacking uracil at 37 °C. Colonies that had lost their thermosensitive phenotype when compared with the same strains transformed with an empty vector were selected. Plasmidic DNA was recovered and DNA inserts were sequenced. The suppressor plasmids were checked by retransformation of the nog1ts and the corresponding wild type LMA240 strains. Their growth phenotypes were compared by spotting transformants in 10–1 dilution steps on minimal medium without uracil at 25, 30, and 37 °C. Matrix Two-hybrid Test—The strain CG1945, transformed with pAS2ΔΔ-NOG1, NSA2, or RLP24 baits, was mated with the strain Y187 transformed with the same genes cloned in pACTIIst. Diploids were spotted on minimal medium without leucine and tryptophan (–LW) and then replicated on minimal medium without leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (–LWH) for the selection of positive clones. The strength of the interactions was estimated by replicating on –LWH medium containing 1, 5, 10, or 25 mm 3-aminotriazol (3-AT). RNA Extraction, Northern Blotting, and Primer Extension—Cells were broken with glass beads, and total RNAs were subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction. RNAs were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide-urea gels or on 1% agarose gels and then transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes and probed with various 32P-labeled oligonucleotides or with random PCR probes complementary to specific mRNAs. Primer extensions were performed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides, and the products were then resolved on 5% polyacrylamide-urea gels. Quantifications were performed with ImageQuant software. Sucrose Gradient and Protein Analysis—Total protein extracts were prepared from exponentially growing yeast cells as described previously (11Saveanu C. Bienvenu D. Namane A. Gleizes P.E. Gas N. Jacquier A. Fromont-Racine M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6475-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and separated on 10–50% sucrose gradients by centrifugation for 3 h at 190,000 × g in a SW41 rotor (Beckman). In each fraction of the gradient, the proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, separated on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged proteins were detected with a 1:10,000 dilution of the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase-soluble complex (Sigma). Native proteins were detected by indirect immunoblotting, using as primary antibodies specific polyclonal rabbit antibodies at 1:2,000 to 1:10,000 dilutions. Anti-Nog1, anti-Rlp24, and anti-Nog2 antibodies were as described by Saveanu et al. (13Saveanu C. Namane A. Gleizes P.E. Lebreton A. Rousselle J.C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Gas N. Jacquier A. Fromont-Racine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4449-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Anti-Nsa2 antibodies were produced by immunization of rabbits with recombinant GST-Nsa2 fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli BL21. Anti-Arx1 and anti-Alb1 antibodies were produced by immunization of rabbits with specific immunogenic peptides and were affinity-purified (Covalab). Antibodies against Nop7, Rpl1, and Tif6 were obtained from J. L. Woolford (Dept. of Biological Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh), F. Lacroute (Centre de Génétique Moléculaire, CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France), and F. Fasiolo (Institut de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS, Strasbourg, France), respectively. Rabbit anti-glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PDH) antibody was from Sigma. Secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase conjugate from Bio-Rad) were used at a 1:10,000 dilution. Visualization of the peroxidase activity was performed with the ECL+ chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Tandem Affinity Purification of Complexes—Protein complexes associated with Nog1-TAP were purified according to the standard TAP protocol (19Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar), starting from 4 liters of yeast culture. The purified protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot as described above. For the analysis of Nsa2-associated RNAs, only the first step of the TAP protocol was performed, with a lysis buffer containing 20 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (New England Biolabs) and a TEV protease digestion buffer containing 0.1 unit/μl recombinant RNasin (Promega). The RNAs contained in the TEV eluates were extracted twice with phenol-chloroform, precipitated, and then analyzed by primer extension or Northern blot as described above. Glucose Repression of Specific Genes—Strains expressing various pre-60 S genes under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter were shifted from galactose- to glucose-containing rich medium. The absorbance at 600 nm was measured for each mutant strain and the corresponding wild type strain over a 24-h time course. Measurements were standardized to A600 nm at time 0. Total proteins or RNAs were extracted from these strains along the time course and consequently analyzed by Western blot or Northern blot as described above. Nog1 and Nsa2 Are Functionally and Physically Linked—Nog1 is a putative GTPase involved in the biogenesis of the 60 S ribosomal subunit. In a previous work (13Saveanu C. Namane A. Gleizes P.E. Lebreton A. Rousselle J.C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Gas N. Jacquier A. Fromont-Racine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4449-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we showed that Nog1 is required, together with Rlp24, for adequate cleavage of ITS2 in the rRNA maturation pathway, suggesting that it might be a regulator of the progression through this step. To get more insights into the function of Nog1 in this process, we searched for functional partners of this factor. Several mutants of NOG1 were obtained by random PCR mutagenesis on the whole ORF. Conditional alleles were selected in a nog1Δ strain, expressing the mutant alleles on a centromeric plasmid. nog1-2 to nog1-5 alleles conferred a thermosensitive phenotype as well as impaired 27 SB processing when strains were grown at 37 °C (data not shown). The most severe phenotype was obtained for nog1-5-containing strains, which were also strongly affected for growth at 25 and 30 °C. nog1-3-containing strains were less affected but displayed pre-60 S export defects when grown for 2 h at 37 °C (data not shown). We performed a high-copy-number suppressor screen with these nog1ts strains grown at 37 °C. In addition to NOG1 itself, the YER126C/NSA2 ORF was selected in eight distinct DNA inserts, seven of which also contained the adjacent ORF, LCP5. The smallest insert was constituted by a DNA fragment extending from 1,040 base pairs upstream of the NSA2 initiation codon to 1,385 base pairs downstream of its stop codon. NSA2 and LCP5 were subcloned, along with their promoter and terminator regions, in 2 μ plasmids. LCP5 alone had no effect on the growth of the mutant strains (data not shown). Fig. 1A shows the suppression of the phenotypes for nog1-3 at 30 and 37 °C and nog1-5 at 25 and 30 °C when either NOG1 or NSA2 was overexpressed. In contrast to NOG1, NSA2 did not complement nog1Δ strains (data not shown). Hence, the genetic link between NSA2 and NOG1 is not due to a functional redundancy of the gene products. Apart from this genetic link between both genes, we could identify, through a two-hybrid matrix analysis, a physical interaction between Nog1 as a prey and Nsa2 as a bait (Fig. 1B). This interaction supported growth of the diploid cells on minimal medium without leucine, tryptophan, or histidine containing up to 5 mm 3-AT (data not shown). Moreover, both Nog1 and Nsa2 also interacted strongly with themselves in the two-hybrid test (Fig. 1B); for Nog1-Nog1 or Nsa2-Nsa2 interactions, diploid cells resisted 3-AT concentrations of 25 mm (data not shown). As a negative control, no interaction was observed between the Rlp24 bait and the Nsa2 prey, whereas this bait could interact with its partner Nog1 (Fig. 1B); this interaction resisted 25 mm 3-AT (data not shown). A two-hybrid interaction was also observed between Nsa2 and mutants of Nog1 blocked either in a GTP- or in a GDP-bound state, as well as with a N-terminal fragment of Nog1 reduced to its first 160 amino acids, a conserved domain located upstream of the hypothetical GTP binding site of the protein (data not shown). TinP1 Is the Orthologue of Nsa2 in Human Cells—Nsa2 (Nop-seven-associated protein 2) is a 261-amino acid-long protein, which was previously identified in pre-60 S complexes isolated by tandem affinity purification (14Harnpicharnchai P. Jakovljevic J. Horsey E. Miles T. Roman J. Rout M. Meagher D. Imai B. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Woolford Jr., J.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 505-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This protein is highly conserved among eukaryotes; its human homologue, TinP1 (TGFβ-inducible nuclear protein 1), displays 62.1% identity and 77.4% similarity with Nsa2, which makes it one of the most conserved proteins in the yeast proteome (15Stanchi F. Bertocco E. Toppo S. Dioguardi R. Simionati B. Cannata N. Zimbello R. Lanfranchi G. Valle G. Yeast. 2001; 18: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The alignment of Nsa2 homologues in model organisms (Fig. 2A) illustrates this strong conservation. We tested whether TinP1 was the orthologue of Nsa2 by complementation experiments. A 2 μ plasmid expressing TINP1 under the control of the PNSA2 promoter was able to complement a strain in which NSA2 was repressed (i.e. a PGAL1-NSA2 strain grown in glucose-containing medium) compared with the same strain transformed with the corresponding empty vector (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in a wild type strain, the overexpression of TINP1 was slightly toxic. Our data strongly suggest that Human TINP1 is thus the orthologue of NSA2. 27 SB rRNA Intermediates Accumulate in the Absence of Nsa2—The functional links between Nog1 and Nsa2 suggested that both factors might be involved in the same cellular pathway. Additionally, previous work (14Harnpicharnchai P. Jakovljevic J. Horsey E. Miles T. Roman J. Rout M. Meagher D. Imai B. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Woolford Jr., J.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 505-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) had shown that Nsa2 is required for maintenance of adequate cellular 60 S ribosomal subunit amounts. Altogether, these data suggested that Nsa2 might be required for the completion of the large ribosomal subunit biogenesis. To identify this step, a strain in which NSA2 was under control of a PGAL1 promoter was shifted to glucose from 0 to 24 h. Mature rRNAs and pre-rRNA species were analyzed and quantified along this repression time course (Fig. 3B). This experiment revealed a decrease in the levels of mature 5.8 S and 25 S rRNA species in the mutant compared with the wild type strain grown in glucose-containing medium. Within the same period of time, 18 S rRNA levels were not affected. As far as rRNA intermediates are concerned, we detected a drop in the 7 S levels (standardized to U2 snRNA), which correlated with an increase in the 27 SB/27 SA2 ratio. We concluded that Nsa2 is required for appropriate C1/C2 cleavage and processing steps of ITS2 during the maturation of the large ribosomal subunit (Fig. 3A). 27 SB and 7 S rRNA Intermediates Accumulate in Nsa2-TAP Complexes—To confirm the involvement of Nsa2 in the processing of ITS2, we isolated rRNA intermediates contained in Nsa2-TAP-associated complexes. After affinity purification on IgG-Sepharose of either a strain expressing NSA2-TAP or a wild type, non-tagged strain as a negative control, primer extension and Northern blot analysis were performed on the TEV eluates (Fig. 3C). 27 SB, 25.5 S, and 7 S rRNA intermediates were strongly enriched in the Nsa2-TAP-associated complexes when compared with the non-tagged strain. Hence, both the substrate and the products of the C2 cleavage step can be found in Nsa2-TAP-containing complexes (Fig. 3A). We could also detect a slight enrichment of 5 S rRNA in the complexes, consistent with this RNA polymerase III transcript being already associated with pre-60 S particles when cleavage of ITS2 occurs. In contrast, no major difference between TEV eluates was detected in the levels of the other pre-rRNAs (27 SA2, 35 S) or mature RNA polymerase I transcripts (25 S, 5.8 S, or 18 S). The observed signals, as well as the observed U2 snRNA levels, thus probably correspond to background contamination. These data indicate that Nsa2 is present in pre-60 S complexes during the ITS2 cleavage. Nog1 Is Involved in Pre-60 S Assembly before Nsa2—To better define the biological processes in which Nog1 and Nsa2 are involved, we attempted to place them in the assembly sketch of the pre-ribosome. We first checked that both proteins were present in macromolecular particles in sucrose gradient experiments followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). Both Nsa2-TAP and Nog1-TAP could be detected in fractions corresponding to the 60 S particles. As a control, the ribosomal protein Rpl1 was found to sediment in the 60 S peak, the 80 S peak, and polysomes (data not shown). To go further with the investigation of the assembly order, we tried to define whether one of these factors was essential for the loading of the other one on the particle. Analysis of Nsa2-TAP-associated complexes was performed in a PGAL1-NOG1 strain shifted to YPD medium for 16 h in order to repress NOG1. Under these conditions, Nsa2 was no longer observed in the 60 S fractions and was undetectable in sucrose gradients (Fig. 4). This correlated with a complete disappearance of the Nsa2-TAP-purified complex (data not shown). Meanwhile, the ribosomal protein Rpl1 was still detected in the 60 S peak, 80 S peak, and polysomes on sucrose gradients (data not shown). Hence we conclude that Nog1 is essential for the presence of Nsa2 in pre-60 S particles. In contrast, Nog1-TAP still sedimented with 60 S particles when NSA2 was repressed for 16 h (Fig. 4). Hence, the absence of Nsa2 did not impair the loading of Nog1 to pre-60 S complexes. However, biogenesis of the large ribosomal subunit was blocked, because rRNA maturation was im"

Their functional and structural properties indicate that they belong to the RNase A superfamily (or tetrapod RNase superfamily), now more appropriately described as the vertebrate RNase superfamily. Our findings suggest why previously repeated efforts to isolate RNases from fish tissues have met with no success; fish RNases have a very low ribonucleolytic activity, and their genes have a low sequence identity with those of mammalian RNases. The investigated RNases are from the bony fish Danio rerio (or zebrafish). Their cDNAs have been cloned and expressed, and the three recombinant proteins have been purified to homogeneity. Their characterization has revealed that they have indeed a very low RNA-degrading activity, when compared with that of RNase A, the superfamily prototype, but comparable with that of mammalian angiogenins; that two of them have angiogenic activity that is inhibited by the cytosolic RNase inhibitor. These data and a phylogenetic analysis indicate that angiogenic fish RNases are the earliest diverging members of the vertebrate superfamily, suggesting that ribonucleases with angiogenic activity were the ancestors of all ribonucleases in the superfamily. They later evolved into both mammalian angiogenins and, through a successful phylogenesis, RNases endowed with digestive features or with diverse bioactivities.

One of the largest and most studied superfamilies of proteins is that of extracellular, pyrimidine-specific, animal RNases. It has been labeled with different names on different bases: the “RNase A superfamily,” a mostly historical name, recognizes bovine pancreatic RNase A, one of the most successfully investigated proteins, as the superfamily prototype; the “pancreatic-type RNase superfamily,” which includes not only the large family of RNases isolated from the pancreas of many animals but also all other RNases phylogenetically related to them; or “the tetrapod RNase superfamily,” as to date the investigated members of this superfamily comprise RNases from mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians but not from fish (1Beintema J.J. Breukelman H.J. Carsana A. Furia A. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 245-269Crossref Google Scholar). Some of the tetrapod RNases have diverse bioactivities, distinct from the ribonucleolytic activity, but strictly dependent on it, including immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, microbicidal, and angiogenic activity (2D'Alessio G. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 106-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The RNases with angiogenic activity, the angiogenins, form a distinct family within the superfamily and are identified by their ability to stimulate the growth of blood vessels (3Strydom D.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 4Riordan J.F. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 446-466Google Scholar). Angiogenins with confirmed angiogenic activity, investigated so far only in mammals, are RNases characterized by a very low catalytic activity, albeit essential to their angiogenic activity, and the presence in their structure of only three disulfides, compared with the four disulfide bridges of most mammalian RNases (3Strydom D.J.

Studies carried out mostly with human angiogenin (hANG) 2The abbreviations used are: hANG, human angiogenin; ZF-RNase, a ribonuclease from zebrafish; cRI, cytosolic RNase inhibitor; EST, expressed sequence tag; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are: hANG, human angiogenin; ZF-RNase, a ribonuclease from zebrafish; cRI, cytosolic RNase inhibitor; EST, expressed sequence tag; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. have indicated that hANG is recognized by a putative 170-kDa receptor on endothelial cells (6Hu G.F. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and is translocated to the cell nucleus (7Moroianu J. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12535-12539Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) where it stimulates rRNA processing (8Xu Z.P. Tsuji T. Riordan J.F. Hu G.-F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It should be added that hANG and mouse angiogenins 1 and 4 also have been found to possess microbicidal activity (9Hooper L.V. Stappenbeck T.S. Hong C.V. Gordon J.I. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Angiogenins are fully inhibited (10Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 86: 1573-1577Google Scholar) by the cytosolic RNase inhibitor (cRI), a Leu-rich repeat protein ubiquitous in mammals (11Dickson K.A. Haigis M.C. Raines R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 80: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Lee F.S. Vallee B.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In fact, hANG binds cRI with the highest affinity so far measured for an RNase (Ki is lower than 1 fm), and the structure of the human cRI·hANG complex has been studied at 2 Å resolution by x-ray crystallography (13Papageorgiou A.C. Shapiro R. Acharya K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5162-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For an investigation of fish RNases we selected zebrafish (Danio rerio), a tropical bony fish, and one of the most favored model organism for the study of vertebrate development including angiogenesis (14Childs S. Chen J.N. Garrity D.M. Fishman M.C. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 973-982PubMed Google Scholar). Zebrafish has been also proposed as an animal system for assaying angiogenesis (15Serbedzija G.N. Flynn E. Willett C.E. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 16Staton C.A. Stribbling S.M. Tazzyman S. Hughes R. Brown N.J. Lewis C.E. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two sequences apparently related to RNase superfamily members are present in a zebrafish DNA data base (Washington University Zebrafish EST Project 1998). As fish RNases have not been investigated to date, we cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli the cDNAs encoding three RNase sequences from the genome of zebrafish. All three recombinant proteins, purified to homogeneity, were active as ribonucleases. Two of them also were found to possess angiogenic activity. These findings, and an analysis of the phylogenetic relationships of the zebrafish RNases/angiogenins with the other RNases of the superfamily, have led to the proposal that fish angiogenins were the ancestral members of the vertebrate RNase superfamily. Isolation and Cloning of Zebrafish RNase cDNAs—Identification of three genes encoding zebrafish RNases, and cloning of their cDNAs were carried out as follows. The sequence subsequently labeled zf-rnase-1 was first identified in the Washington University Zebrafish EST Project 1998 data base, with accession number wz5727.1. It contained the EST sequence fb58b02.y1 clearly encoding a member of the pancreatic-type superfamily, termed in the data base an “angiogenin-related protein precursor.” A large fragment, obtained from the Resource Center and Primary Database (RZPD GmbH, Berlin, Germany), cloned in pSPORT1 vector, was found to contain the sequence. The N terminus of the encoded protein was identified using the SignalP 3.0 Server program. However, an inspection of the sequence in the Zebrafish genome data base, under completion in the Sanger Institute (Cambridge, UK) revealed that the sequence was incomplete, as it lacked the 15-nucleotide stretch upstream of the cDNA stop codon that encodes the last five amino acid residues at the C terminus of the expected protein. Thus, two PCR steps were performed. By a first PCR, the fragment starting with the 5′-end of the cDNA encoding the expected RNase, devoid of the signal peptide, was amplified. The oligonucleotides (synthesized by MWG Biotech, Firenze, Italy) employed were: 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCATGTAAAGGAGCGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTATCCGACGTTGACTTCGTCTTCATGATAATGCA-3′ (reverse). The reaction was performed with the Taq polymerase High Fidelity Kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR procedure included 5 min at 95 °C and 35 cycles consisting of 45 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and 7 min at 72 °C. The amplified fragment was isolated by low melting, 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using the Product Purification Kit (Roche Applied Science). The second PCR was carried out for the addition of the missing sequence encoding the five C-terminal amino acid residues. The forward oligonucleotide sequence was the same as for the previous PCR, and the reverse was: 5′-CGACGTTGACTTCGTCTTCATGATAATGCACA-GGCCATCCTTCC-3′. The PCR procedure and the isolation and purification of the amplified product were as described above for the first PCR. The amplified cDNA fragment, previously treated with restrictases NcoI and EcoRI (Novagen, Madison, WI), was cloned into the pET22b(+) expression vector. The gene sequence labeled zf-rnase-2 was also found in the Washington University Zebrafish EST Project 1998 data base, with accession number fd55b09.y1, and was recognized in the data base as encoding a “mouse-angiogenin-related protein.” A DNA fragment from the RZPD data base was found to contain the sequence and was acquired from RZPD as cloned in plasmid pSPORT1. The N- and C-terminal ends of the encoded protein were identified as described above for zf-rnase-1. The cDNA of interest (devoid of the signal peptide) was obtained by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: forward, 5′-GTTAAGCCATGGATAATGAGTCCCCTTATG-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGAAAGAATTCTTAGCCTGAGCTGTTTACA-3′. The PCR procedure and the isolation and purification of the cDNA were as described above for zf-rnase-1. The obtained cDNA was then treated with NdeI and HindIII restrictases and inserted into the pET22b(+) expression vector. The third RNase-type sequence (zf-rnase-3) from zebrafish genome was identified on the basis of its relatedness to RNase-encoding genes in the zebrafish genome data base (accession number ENSDARG36171) under completion in the Sanger Institute (Cambridge, UK). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with mRNA from adult (6-month) zebrafish specimens. The oligonucleotides were: forward, 5′-TGGCCTGTGCATTATCAT-3′; reverse, 5′-TTAGG-GGC-GGTTTATTTC-3′. The PCR was carried out under the following conditions: one cycle at 94 °C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 50.7 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 3 min, and finally one cycle at 72 °C for 15 min. The amplified fragment was isolated by electrophoresis on a low melting, 1% agarose gel and purified as described above. The excised band of interest was cloned in a pGEM T-easy plasmid. The sequence encoding the signal peptide, identified as described above for the other cDNAs, was excised from the plasmid through a PCR with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGAAATAAGGCGCCGT-3′ (forward); 5′-CCCAAGCTTAAATAACACCTTTTTCATAGT-3′ (reverse). The resulting cDNA, treated with NdeI and HindIII, was cloned into the pET22b(+) expression vector. All cloned, purified DNAs were certified through sequencing (MWG Biotech) before processing. It should be noted that the sequence of zf-rnase-3 in the zebrafish genome data base contained at position 91 a guanine and at position 214 a thymine, whereas in the sequence isolated from adult zebrafish and used for expression of the recombinant protein, we found a cytosine at both positions. This did not produce any change in the amino acid encoded by the triplet 214-216 (leucine), but it altered the amino acid encoded by the triplet 91-93 (from glycine to arginine). Likely, the observed changes are due to single nucleotide polymorphism, nonsynonymous in the latter case. Expression and Purification of Zebrafish RNases—The three expression plasmids, each containing a cDNA encoding a presumed zebrafish RNase, were used to transform competent E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (provided by Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 = 1 and then induced with 0.1 m isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside and grown overnight. Pelleted cells were sonicated at 20 kHz in an Ultrasonic sonicator (Heat System Ultrasonic, Farmingdale, NY) with 30-s impulses, each followed by a 30-s rest, for a 15-min total time. The sonicated cells were centrifuged for 1 h at 12,000 rpm to separate inclusion bodies. As the three proteins were found to be expressed exclusively in inclusion bodies, these were solubilized with 7 m guanidine-HCl in 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.4, containing 1 mm glutathione. After flushing nitrogen for 10 min, each preparation was left for 2 h at room temperature. Renaturation was obtained through an initial dilution 1:20, drop by drop, in 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.4, containing 0.5 m l-arginine and 1 mm oxidized glutathione. After 24 h at room temperature, the three preparations were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and loaded on SP-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer and run on an Akta purifier (Amersham Biosciences). Elution was carried out with a gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in the same buffer. In the range 0.3 of 0.4 M NaCl a protein peak was eluted, which for each preparation was found by SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar) to contain essentially a single protein with the approximate molecular size of an RNase; a low level of RNase activity was revealed through zymograms (see Fig. 1). These proteins were thus labeled ZF-RNase-1, -2, and -3. The fractions containing ZF-RNase-1 and -3 from the chromatographic runs on SP-Sepharose were loaded on a reverse-phase C-4 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 100% solution A (composed of 5% acetonitrile (v/v) and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). The column was eluted with a gradient in which the concentration of solution B (composed of 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was raised to 100% in 1 h. For each preparation a single, major protein component was eluted, which by SDS-PAGE was found to contain a single protein (see Fig. 1). As for the ZF-RNase-2 protein eluted from the SP-Sepharose column, the corresponding fractions were loaded on a Resource-S column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, eluted first with a gradient from 0 to 0.3 m NaCl in the same buffer, and then with an isocratic run at 0.3 m NaCl. The major component eluted with 0.3 m NaCl was finally purified on a reverse-phase C-4 column, run as described above for the final purification of ZF-RNase-1 and -3. Assays of RNase Activity—Zymogram assays of RNase activity were carried out as described previously (18Blank A. Sugiyama R.H. Dekker C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (17Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar). Quantitative assays of RNase activity were carried out with the fluorogenic substrate 6-carboxy-fluorescein-dArUdAdA-6-carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) (19Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 20-60 nm substrate depending on the enzyme activity, and suitable enzyme aliquots. Inhibition by cRI (Fermentas International, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) of the RNase activity of the zebrafish enzymes was measured by repeating the assays in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of cRI. Assays of Angiogenic Activity—The assay was based on previously described assays (20Lawley T.J. Kubota Y. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1989; 93: 59S-61SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Kanzawa S. Endo H. Shioya N. Ann. Plast. Surg. 1993; 30: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A 48-well plate was coated with Matrigel (150 μl/well, purchased from BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 37 °C. human umbilical endothelial vein cells (3.5 × 104 cells/well, obtained from Cambrex, Milan, Italy) were seeded in 250 μl of EBM-2 medium (Cambrex) in the presence of hANG (a kind gift of Dr. Guo-fu Hu, Harvard Medical School) or one of the three zebrafish RNases at 200 ng/ml. Complete EGM-2 medium (Cambrex) and unsupplemented EBM-2 basal medium were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. After 6 h of incubation, capillary-like tube formation was examined under an inverted phase microscope. Cells were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 1% paraformaldehyde and photographed. The effects of the human cytosolic RNase inhibitor on the angiogenic activity of zebrafish RNases were analyzed by adding to the medium a 5-fold molar excess of inhibitor. All assays were performed in duplicate, and repeated three times. Bioinformatic Tools—DNA and protein sequences were analyzed using the programs BLAST and FUGUE (22Shi J. Blundell T. Mizuguchi J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). FUGUE utilizes environment-specific substitution tables and structure-dependent gap penalties, so that scores for amino acid matching and insertions/deletions are evaluated depending on the local environment of each amino acid residue in a known structure. It thus produces the best possible alignment to sequences of proteins with known three-dimensional structures, which can be used as input for modeling. The template chosen was the structure of human angiogenin (Protein Data Bank code 1a4y), and the program was MODELLER (23Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10504) Google Scholar). Cladistic analyses were performed by ClustalW alignments and with the previously described program, MEGA 3.0 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (24Kumar S. Tamura K. Jakobsen I.B. Nei M. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2001; 17: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar)). For this procedure the neighbor-joining option was used with Poisson-corrected distances to generate an unrooted phylogenetic tree. Phylogeny was tested by 2000 bootstrap replications. Isolation, Cloning, and Expression of Zebrafish RNases—Two putative zebrafish RNase-type sequences were available; one of them was incomplete in the published data bases, in which they were identified as proteins phylogenetically related to RNases or angiogenins. The cDNAs encoding these putative RNases, isolated from purchased DNA fragments, were trimmed, reconstructed, and cloned in expression vectors. A third RNase-type sequence was identified in the zebrafish genome, under completion in the Sanger Institute (Cambridge, UK). The latter was isolated through reverse transcription-PCR with mRNA from adult zebrafish specimens. Details on the cloning are under “Experimental Procedures.” An inspection of the genes encoding the zebrafish RNases indicated (data not shown) that, as for all RNase genes investigated thus far, they are comprised in a single exon and have signal peptides for extracellular expression. Each cDNA was cloned in the expression vector pET22b(+) and used to transform competent E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The proteins, expressed exclusively in inclusion bodies, were subjected to denaturation/renaturation steps and purified to homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 shows an SDS-PAGE analysis and a zymogram of the purified proteins carried out with yeast RNA as a substrate. The three purified proteins had ribonucleolytic activity when relatively high protein aliquots (10 μg) were used. Their molecular sizes, determined by mass spectrometry, were those expected from their amino acid sequences (reported in parentheses following). They were: 14,323.91 ± 0.48 Da (14,330.44); 14,455.49 ± 0.27 Da (14,461.42); and 14,464.78 ± 0.49 Da (14,471.41) for ZF-RNase-1, -2 and -3, respectively. These findings also indicated that the six Cys residues in each sequence form three disulfide bridges, as there is a difference of 6 Da between the observed and the theoretical mass values. Furthermore, amino acid sequencing carried out for the N-terminal 25 residues indicated that the three proteins had the expected N-terminal sequences. An examination of these sequences revealed that the catalytically essential residues of RNase A, namely His-12, His-119, and Lys-41, were present at correspondingly close sequence positions in all three proteins (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, all three proteins had the standard “RNase signature,” i.e. CKXXNTF, whereas the other RNase signature, namely PVHXD/E, was present in ZF-RNase-2 but was only partially conserved in ZF-RNase-1 and -3, as it occurs in several sequences of non-mammalian RNases. The overall sequence identity values of the three proteins with respect to RNase A were: 31.3, 33.3, and 30.8%, for ZF-RNase-1, -2, and -3, respectively. Higher identity values could be calculated for the three proteins with respect to human angiogenin, an RNase with angiogenic activity. The latter values were: 35.4, 36.2, and 36.2 for ZF-RNase-1, -2, and -3, respectively. In particular, all three proteins shared with all mammalian angiogenins thus far analyzed a consensus sequence within the first 12 N-terminal residues characterized as “YXX-FLXQH.” All three ZF-RNases possess three disulfides (see above) as has been found for non-mammalian RNases and mammalian angiogenins as well. Characterization of Zebrafish RNases—The purified proteins were tested for RNase activity with a sensitive assay (19Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This led to the evaluation of the low activity of these enzymes and provided a direct determination of kcat/Km values. As tabulated in Table 1, the three zebrafish proteins have a very low RNase activity with respect to that of RNase A, but it is comparable with that of human angiogenin.TABLE 1Ribonuclease activity of zebrafish RNases compared with the activities of RNase A and hANGEnzymekcat/KmM−1 s−1RNase A1.6 ± 0.12 × 107Zf-RNase-12.3 ± 0.25 × 103Zf-RNase-26.3 ± 0.50 × 102Zf-RNase-36.0 ± 0.74 × 103hANG7.4 ± 0.72 × 102 Open table in a new tab When we tested the three RNases in the presence of cRI, the human cytosolic RNase inhibitor, we found that under the conditions of the assay stoichiometric amounts of cRI fully inhibited (100%) the RNase activity of ZF-RNase-1 and -2, whereas ZF-RNase-3 was inhibited only by 23%. The finding of a very low RNase activity of the zebrafish enzymes, typical of angiogenins and the sequence similarities reported above between the zebrafish RNases and mammalian angiogenins motivated us to determine whether the zebrafish enzymes possess angiogenic activity. The assays were based on the formation of capillary-like microtubules when primary endothelial cells were grown on Matrigel in the presence of the effectors (20Lawley T.J. Kubota Y. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1989; 93: 59S-61SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Kanzawa S. Endo H. Shioya N. Ann. Plast. Surg. 1993; 30: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that ZF-RNase-1 and -2 were found to possess a marked angiogenic activity, comparable with that of human angiogenin. ZF-RNase-3, instead, was found to have no angiogenic activity. Interestingly, the angiogenic activity of ZF-RNase-1 and -2 was completely inhibited by the cytosolic RNase inhibitor (see Fig. 3). These findings led us to analyze the structure of the zebrafish RNases through modeling based on the structure of human angiogenin (Protein Data Bank code 1a4y) as a template. The models were validated using ANOLEA (25Melo F. Devos D. Depiereux E. Feytmans E. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1997; 5: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar), and the occurrence of dihedral φ and ψ angles outside allowed areas of the Ramachandran plot was assessed with SEGNO (26Cubellis M.V. Caillez F. Blundell T.L. Lovell S.C. Proteins. 2005; 58: 880-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As expected from the sequence-structure alignments of the sequences as produced by FUGUE (see Fig. 2), the models constructed for Zf-RNase1, -2, and -3 (shown in Fig. 4) closely resemble the structure of angiogenin, with two significant differences: the loop between the first and second α-helix is shorter in zebrafish RNases; and the loop that follows the second α-helix in the sequence was found to be longer in the zebrafish proteins (see Figs. 2 and 4). ZF-RNases in the RNase Vertebrate Superfamily—A preliminary phylogenetic analysis of zebrafish RNases was carried out by comparing their amino acid sequences with those available in the vertebrate RNase superfamily. The rootless tree illustrated in Fig. 5, with radiant branches, includes representative members from the main classes of vertebrate RNases. The bootstrap values are satisfactory, allowing inspection of the relationships among clades with low or no ambiguity. Only for the divergences, bird/mammal and fish/amphibian bootstrap values lower than 50% were found (42 and 46%, respectively). The monophyletic group of fish RNases, including the three zebrafish RNases and a sequence identified in salmon (NCBI accession number BG936674), appears to be closely related to the family that comprises non-mammalian RNases from amphibians, reptiles, and birds. Mammalian pancreatic RNases (RNases 1) are quite distant from fish and other non-mammalian RNases. The independent clade of mammalian angiogenins (RNases 5) is instead more closely related to the early diverged non-mammalian RNases than to mammalian pancreatic RNases 1. It should be noted that ZF-RNase-3, which has been found devoid of angiogenic activity, appears to be more closely related to salmon RNase than to the other two ZF-RNases endowed with angiogenic activity. We report here the first investigation on RNases from fish. As RNases thus far have been found and studied in all tetrapods, the characterization of three fish proteins as RNA-degrading enzymes leads to a more appropriate definition of the animal, extracellular, pyrimidine-specific RNase superfamily as the vertebrate RNase superfamily. Based on the inspection of RNase genes, it has been proposed (27Cho S. Beintema J.J. Zhang J. Genomics. 2005; 85: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) that the earliest members of the RNase superfamily are related to the families of RNases 5 (angiogenins) and/or non-mammalian RNases. The findings reported here on the characterization of three fish RNases provide experimental support to this hypothesis. Moreover, based on the evidence that indeed two fish RNases, namely ZF-RNase-1 and -2 from zebrafish, are endowed with angiogenic activity, we propose that all vertebrate RNases evolved from early diverged angiogenic RNases from fish. Upon evolution, they diversified and experienced selection, thus engendering two distinct evolutionary major clades: (i) that of pancreatic RNases possessing digestive abilities, or diverse noncatalytic bioactions, that were still based on their ability to degrade RNA (2D'Alessio G. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 106-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); (ii) that of mammalian angiogenins, with angiogenic activity and a low but essential RNase activity (4Riordan J.F. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 446-466Google Scholar). In fact, as one of the three investigated zebrafish RNases, ZF-RNase-3, does not have angiogenic activity, we can suggest that RNases with or without angiogenic activity diverged at a very early stage in the evolution of fish, before the divergence of the closely related amphibian RNases. However, early diverged fish RNases have all the features of superfamily members: they are encoded in a single exon, possess a signal peptide, are stabilized by disulfides, and are endowed with ribonucleolytic activity determined by the presence of two critically positioned His residues and a Lys residue. Work is in progress on the identification of RNases from hagfish, lampreys, and elasmobranchs (dogfish) to verify whether the RNase/angiogenin scaffold preceded the divergence of bony fishes. It should be noted that RNase superfamily members have not been found in invertebrates (28Beintema J.J. Kleineidam R.G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to verify whether the fish angiogenins investigated here have any microbicidal activity, as has been found for human and some mouse angiogenins (9Hooper L.V. Stappenbeck T.S. Hong C.V. Gordon J.I. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). A comparison of the two zebrafish RNases with angiogenic activity, ZF-RNase-1 and -2, with the best characterized mammalian angiogenins shows that similarities, but also differences, are detectable. As found for mammalian angiogenins (7Moroianu J. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12535-12539Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the zebrafish angiogenic ZF-RNase-2 contains in its sequence a putative nuclear translocation signal at positions 30-36 (KRKITAK). A string of basic amino acids is also present in ZF-RNase-3 (RRITR at positions 30-34), but ZF-RNase-3 does not display angiogenic activity. The fish angiogenins do not present in their primary structures the two Asn residues (at sequence positions 61 and 109 of human angiogenin) in which deamidation leads to a loss of angiogenic activity (4Riordan J.F. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 446-466Google Scholar). It has been presumed that mouse Ang-4 is devoid of angiogenic activity because it presents a replacement of Asn with Lys at position 61 (3Strydom D.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); however, ZF-RNase-1 and -2 do not present this critical residue, yet they have angiogenic activity. It should be noted that the angiogenic activity of human and other mammalian angiogenins were assayed with a chicken experimental system (29Knighton D. Ausprunk D. Tapper D. Folkman J. Br. J. Cancer. 1977; 35: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), whereas fish angiogenins were assayed with a human system (see “Experimental Procedures”). Tests carried out on mammalian and fish angiogenins with identical assay systems should help to verify the actual significance of sequence signals in the tested angiogenins. The availability of the angiogenins described here can help to investigate angiogenesis in zebrafish and the role(s) of the newly isolated angiogenins in the angiogenic process, both in the adult animals and in developing zebrafish embryos. In fact angiogenesis has been successfully studied in zebrafish as a very convenient experimental system (14Childs S. Chen J.N. Garrity D.M. Fishman M.C. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 973-982PubMed Google Scholar), and developing zebrafish embryos have been proposed as a model for angiogenic/antiangiogenic drug screening (15Serbedzija G.N. Flynn E. Willett C.E. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). It is surprising that the human cytosolic RNase inhibitor can exert its inhibitory effects on fish RNases. The presence of cRI has been reported only in mammals (11Dickson K.A. Haigis M.C. Raines R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 80: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Lee F.S. Vallee B.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30Hofsteenge J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 621-658Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, cRI has been found to inhibit all tested mammalian RNases, with the exception of seminal RNase, a finding explained by the dimeric structure of this RNase, which is the only RNase of the superfamily with such a structure (31D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Mazzarella L. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Riordan G. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 383-423Crossref Google Scholar). It does not inhibit an amphibian RNase such as onconase (32Wu Y. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Gadina M. Mikulski S.M. De Lorenzo C. D'Alessio G. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17476-17481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas RNase inhibitors from birds and amphibians do not inhibit RNase A, the superfamily prototype (30Hofsteenge J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 621-658Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, either fishes possess an RNase inhibitor homologous to mammalian cRI that has not yet been detected in evolutionarily related species, or we have a case of proteins that just happen to interact apart from any basic biological significance, as in the case of biotin and avidin. We thank Dr. Robert Shapiro for valuable criticism of the manuscript and suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W1974886674,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important cytokine involved in the regulation of innate immunity and present at increased levels during inflammatory responses. Here we demonstrate that mature blood and tissue neutrophils constitutively express MIF as a cytosolic protein not associated with azurophil granules. Functionally active MIF, but not proteases stored in azurophil granules, was released from apoptotic neutrophils following short term tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha stimulation in a caspase-dependent manner and prior to any detectable phagocytosis by monocyte-derived macrophages. Moreover, TNF-alpha-mediated MIF release was blocked by glyburide and propenicide, both inhibitors of ATP-binding cassette-type transporters, suggesting that this transporter system is activated during neutrophil apoptosis. Taken together, apoptotic mature neutrophils release MIF upon short term TNF-alpha stimulation. Therefore, apoptosis may not always occur without the induction of pro-inflammatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1973366782,"Neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release to the synaptic clefts is mediated by the formation of a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, which includes two target SNAREs syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 and one vesicle SNARE VAMP-2. The target SNAREs syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 form a heterodimer, the putative intermediate of the SNARE complex. Neurotransmitter GABA clearance from synaptic clefts is carried out by the reuptake function of its transporters to terminate the postsynaptic signaling. Syntaxin 1A directly binds to the neuronal GABA transporter GAT-1 and inhibits its reuptake function. However, whether other SNARE proteins or SNARE complex regulates GABA reuptake remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that SNAP-25 efficiently inhibits GAT-1 reuptake function in the presence of syntaxin 1A. This inhibition depends on SNAP-25/syntaxin 1A complex formation. The H3 domain of syntaxin 1A is identified as the binding sites for both SNAP-25 and GAT-1. SNAP-25 binding to syntaxin 1A greatly potentiates the physical interaction of syntaxin 1A with GAT-1 and significantly enhances the syntaxin 1A-mediated inhibition of GAT-1 reuptake function. Furthermore, nitric oxide, which promotes SNAP-25 binding to syntaxin 1A to form the SNARE complex, also potentiates the interaction of syntaxin 1A with GAT-1 and suppresses GABA reuptake by GAT-1. Thus our findings delineate a further molecular mechanism for the regulation of GABA reuptake by a target SNARE complex and suggest a direct coordination between GABA release and reuptake.

Membrane fusion and subsequent GABA release are catalyzed by the assembly of a ternary complex from soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins (1Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). The ternary complex is composed of two plasma membrane proteins, including syntaxin 1A and synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25), which are called target SNAREs (t-SNAREs), and one vesicle-associated protein synaptobrevin 2 (VAMP-2), which is called vesicle SNARE (2Hua Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8065-8070Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Mochida S. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 36: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The t-SNAREs syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 form a heterodimer, the putative intermediate of the SNARE complex, and offer target sites for the vesicle SNARE VAMP-2 leading to membrane fusion (4An S.J. Almers W. Science. 2004; 306: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Fasshauer D. Margittai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7613-7621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After membrane fusion, GABA is released from synaptic vesicles to synaptic clefts and binds to postsynaptic GABA receptors and thus transmits the signal to the postsynaptic terminals. GABA is cleared away rapidly from synaptic clefts to terminate synaptic transmission through the reuptake function of its specific, high affinity, sodium- and chloride-dependent transporters (6Dingledine R. Korn S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 366: 387-409Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which are located on presynaptic terminals and surrounding glial cells (7Jursky F. Tamura S. Tamura A. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 283-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GABA transporters are mainly divided into four subtypes, including GAT-1, GAT-2, GAT-3, and BGT-1, of which GAT-1 is the most abundant neuronal subtype (8Borden L.A. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 335-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). GAT-1, GAT-2, and GAT-3 have 12 transmembrane regions, with both N and C termini facing intracellularly. GAT-2 and GAT-3 display about 52% amino acid identity with GAT-1 (8Borden L.A. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 335-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that GABA reuptake from the synaptic clefts is an important mechanism in the regulation of GABA activity in synaptic neurotransmission (9Soudijn W. van Wijngaarden I. Curr. Med. Chem. 2000; 7: 1063-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Specific GABA transporter inhibitors are revealed to prolong the decay phase of GABA, type A, receptor-mediated postsynaptic potential (10Isaacson J.S. Solis J.M. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and to increase the magnitude of responses mediated by the G protein-coupled GABA, type B, receptor (6Dingledine R. Korn S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 366: 387-409Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Isaacson J.S. Solis J.M. Nicoll R.A.

Neurotransmitter transporters are regulated through a variety of signal transduction mechanisms that maintain appropriate levels of transmitter in the synaptic clefts. Both signaling molecules, including extracellular substrate (12Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 889-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Whitworth T.L. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42932-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and intracellular second messengers such as kinases and phosphatases (14Quick M.W. Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the proteins directly binding to the neurotransmitter transporters are known to act on the transporters and modulate their function. Recent reports of transporters regulated by directly binding proteins come from the investigations that the transporters, such as the inhibitory transmitter glycine transporter (15Geerlings A. Lopez-Corcuera B. Aragon C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the major excitatory transmitter glutamate transporter (16Zhu Y. Fei J. Schwarz W. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), serotonin transporter (17Haase J. Killian A.M. Magnani F. Williams C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 722-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Quick M.W. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and norepinephrine transporter (19Sung U. Apparsundaram S. Galli A. Kahlig K.M. Savchenko V. Schroeter S. Quick M.W. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are functionally regulated by the t-SNARE syntaxin 1A. As to the GABA transporters, it is reported that syntaxin 1A interacts with the GABA transporter GAT-1 and results in a decrease of its reuptake function (20Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syntaxin 1A positively regulates GAT-1 surface expression (21Horton N. Quick M.W. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) but exerts its inhibitory actions by directly binding to GAT-1 and decreasing its transport rate (22Deken S.L. Beckman M.L. Boos L. Quick M.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These investigations demonstrate a direct link between neurotransmitter release and reuptake. However, it remains largely unknown whether other SNARE proteins or the SNARE complex regulate GABA reuptake. Further coordination between neurotransmitter release and reuptake needs to be explored. Increasing studies from the ion channels indicate that Kv2.1 potassium channel and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator chloride channel, which reside on the plasma membrane to control the intracellular or extracellular concentrations of respective ions, are functionally regulated by the t-SNARE complex (23Michaelevski I. Chikvashvili D. Tsuk S. Singer-Lahat D. Kang Y. Linial M. Gaisano H.Y. Fili O. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34320-34330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Cormet-Boyaka E. Di A. Chang S.Y. Naren A.P. Tousson A. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12477-12482Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because the t-SNARE complex acts on the ion channels, and syntaxin 1A physically interacts with and functionally regulates those neurotransmitter transporters, it is most likely that other SNARE proteins or the SNARE complex may modulate those transporters. In this study, we found that SNAP-25 significantly inhibited GABA transporter GAT-1 reuptake function. The physical and functional interactions between SNAP-25 and GAT-1 depended on syntaxin 1A, and SNAP-25 binding to syntaxin 1A inhibited GAT-1 reuptake function through enhancing the physical interaction of syntaxin 1A with GAT-1. Our results also provided the evidence that the SNARE complex formation promoted the direct binding of syntaxin 1A to GAT-1 and resulted in the inhibition of GABA reuptake by GAT-1, elucidating a coordination of neurotransmitter release and reuptake. Plasmids—The full lengths of SNAP-25 and VAMP-2 were cloned into modified pcDNA3 vector in-frame with HA at the N terminus. G43D-GFP plasmid was obtained from Dr. Maurine E. Linder, and G43D was cloned into pcDNA3 vector with HA at the N terminus. Plasmid DNA of syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 1AΔH3 were gifts from Dr. Anjaparavanda P. Naren and Dr. Kevin L. Kirk and were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector in-frame with FLAG at the N terminus. Syntaxin 1AΔH3 was also cloned into the pcDNA3 vector with CFP at the N terminus. Plasmid DNA of GAT-1, EAAC1, GLT1, and GLAST were provided by Dr. Jian Fei. The full lengths of GAT-1, GAT-2, GAT-3, EAAC1, GLT1, and GLAST were cloned into modified pcDNA3 vector in-frame with HA at the N terminus. GAT-2 and GAT-3 were also cloned into the pcDNA3 vector with YFP at the N terminus. Constructions of RNA interference plasmids were described in our previous paper (25Gao H. Sun Y. Wu Y. Luan B. Wang Y. Qu B. Pei G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 303-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences for the small interference RNAs (siRNA) were 5′-GGCCGCAAAGACCTTGTCCTTA-3′ for syntaxin 1A, 5′-GGAGCAGATGGCCATCAGTGA-3′ for SNAP-25, and 5′-GGACCAGAAGCTATCGGAACTA-3′ for VAMP-2, respectively. The siRNA for SNAP-25 was also cloned into the BS/U6-GFP vector. Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary cultured hippocampal neurons were prepared from 1-day-old postnatal Sprague-Dawley rats using the method described previously (26Xu N.J. Bao L. Fan H.P. Bao G.B. Pu L. Lu Y.J. Wu C.F. Zhang X. Pei G. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4775-4784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain purely neuronal cultures, the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was replaced at 4-6 h later with Neurobasal-A medium containing B27 serum-free supplement (Invitrogen) for hippocampal neuronal culture. Twenty four hours later, the cultures were treated with 5 μm cytosine arabinoside for 72 h. The neurons were transfected using the rat neuron nucleofector kit for primary rat hippocampal or cortical neurons (Program O-03 or G-13, Amaxa Biosystems). In brief, we resuspended the prepared neurons into rat neuron nucleofector solution at room temperature to a final concentration of 4-5 × 106 cells/100 μl. We then mixed 100 μl of cell suspension with 1-3 μg of DNA and transferred the nucleofection sample into a certified cuvette (Amaxa Biosystems). The cuvette was inserted into the cuvette holder, and program O-03 or G-13 was run. After the addition of 500 μl of pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, the cell was transferred into the prepared 24-well plates and incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. After 2-4 h, we carefully replaced the medium with 750 μl of fresh Neurobasal-A medium containing B27 serum-free supplement (Invitrogen) to remove cellular debris. The transfection efficiency was 50-70%. PC12 cells and HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. PC12 cells were maintained in F12K medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). HEK293 clls were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with standard supplements. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells was by using the calcium phosphate method. [3H]GABA Uptake Assay—GABA uptake in cultured neurons and transfected PC12 or HEK293 cells was performed as described previously (27Cai G. Salonikidis P.S. Fei J. Schwarz W. Schulein R. Reutter W. Fan H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1625-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in a monolayer on 24-well plates. The cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer/HEPES (KRH) medium, pH 7.4, containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 25mm HEPES, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 10 mm glucose at 37 °C for 30 min, and then 10 nm [3H]GABA (Amersham Biosciences) and 30 μm unlabeled GABA (Sigma) were added to initiate the uptake. Nonspecific uptake was determined with sodium-free KRH medium in which choline chloride was used instead of NaCl. After incubation for 5-15 min, the uptake was terminated by two ice-cold washes with 500 μl of sodium-free KRH medium, followed by immediate lysis in 200 μl of ice-cold 0.1 m NaOH. 100 μl of lysate was loaded onto glass fiber filters and then analyzed for radioactivity. Finally, the filters containing cellular lysate were processed for scintillation counting (Beckman Instruments). Under these conditions the uptake is linear with time. The protein quantity was measured using the BCA kit (Pierce). The GABA uptake activity was measured as fmol/min/mg protein. Data were from at least three separate experiments, two samples or two wells per treatment per experiment. In the assay of GABA uptake with drug treatment, NOC-18 (Calbiochem) or NTG (Sigma) or NOC-18/PTIO (Calbiochem) or NO-711 (Sigma) was added into the uptake reaction buffer. Cell Surface Biotinylation and Western Blotting—Cell surface biotinylation assay in transfected HEK293 cells or cultured neurons was performed as described (28Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NOC-18 was added into culture medium without serum to stimulate the primary cultured hippocampal neurons and then washed away before the cell surface biotinylation labeling. The cells were incubated with a solution containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline/Ca2+/Mg2+ for 20 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The biotinylation solution was removed by two washes in phosphate-buffered saline/Ca2+/Mg2+ plus 100 mm glycine and quenched in this solution by incubating the cells at 4 °C for 45 min with gentle shaking. Then the cells were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 250 μm PMSF) at 4 °C for 60 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. The supernatant fractions were incubated with Immunopure Immobilized Monomeric Avidin beads (Pierce) at room temperature for 60 min. After efficient washing, the beads were incubated for 30 min at 50 °C in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Then the samples were analyzed by standard Western blotting using rabbit anti-GAT-1 antibody (1:1000; Abcam) and mouse anti-syntaxin 1A antibody (1:1000; Synaptic Systems). The bands were quantified with ScionImage software (Scion). Immunocytochemistry—Immunofluorescence staining of transfected PC12 cells was carried out as described (29Bao L. Jin S.X. Zhang C. Wang L.H. Xu Z.Z. Zhang F.X. Wang L.C. Ning F.S. Cai H.J. Guan J.S. Xiao H.S. Xu Z.Q. He C. Hokfelt T. Zhou Z. Zhang X.

The PC12 cells cotransfected FLAG-syntaxin 1A and/or HA-SNAP-25 with GAT-1-GFP were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG (1:500, Sigma) and/or rabbit anti-HA antibody (1:500, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, followed by second antibodies conjugated with indocarbocyanine (Cy3) and indodicarbocyanine (Cy5) (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cells were then washed and mounted with PermaFluor Mountant Medium (Thermo). GAT-1-GFP was identified through GFP fluorescence detection. NOC-18 was added into the culture medium without serum to stimulate PC12 cells transfected with GAT-1-GFP and were washed away before immunohistochemistry. The cells were incubated with mouse anti-syntaxin 1A (1:500; Synaptic Systems) and rabbit anti-SNAP-25 antibody (1:500; Sigma) overnight at 4 °C and followed by second antibodies conjugated with Cy3 and Cy5. The images were captured with the Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. The cells exhibiting distinct “ring” staining were quantified among 100 randomly selected positive cells in each group of experiments. Coimmunoprecipitation—Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed in buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.8% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 250 μm PMSF). The supernatants were treated with protein G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) followed by incubation with the immunoprecipitated antibodies (mouse anti-syntaxin 1A, mouse anti-SNAP-25, rabbit anti-GAT-1, and mouse anti-HA) at 4 °C for 2-4 h. Hippocampal neurons were lysed in buffer (9.1 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.7 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 250 μm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate), and the supernatants were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C before Protein G-agarose beads were added. The brains were removed from 1-day-old postnatal Sprague-Dawley rats. Brain samples were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (4 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm glucose, 250 μm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) in a glass-Teflon homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were spun at 4 °C. The pellets were suspended in the lysis buffer for neurons described above at 4 °C for 1 h and then were centrifuged. The supernatants were incubated with antibodies (rabbit anti-GAT-1/2/3; Chemicon) overnight at 4 °C before Protein G-agarose beads were added. Proteins in the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by standard Western blotting. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Measurements—FRET measurements were performed essentially as described (31Liu J. Ernst S.A. Gladycheva S.E. Lee Y.Y. Lentz S.I. Ho C.S. Li Q. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55924-55936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Image acquisition and determination of FRET efficiency by acceptor photobleaching were obtained using the Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope and analytical software. Briefly, emission spectra from the cells expressing CFP-syntaxin 1A or CFP-syntaxin 1AΔH3 and YFP-GAT-1 or YFP-GAT-2 or YFP-GAT-3 were obtained with the λ mode, using the 405 nm line of laser. For measurement of FRET efficiency by this method, Leica software application for acceptor photobleaching was applied. The selected cell surface areas were photobleached of YFP-GAT-1 or YFP-GAT-2 or YFP-GAT-3 with 514 nm line of laser. Reduction of the YFP signal after photobleaching for CFP-syntaxin 1A and YFP-GAT-1 cotransfected PC12 cells was on average 78 ± 4.8% (n = 50). FRET was resolved as an increase in the CFP-syntaxin 1A (donor) signal after photobleaching of YFP-GAT-1 (acceptor). Relative FRET efficiency was calculated as (1 - (CFP Ipre-bleach/CFP Ipost-bleach)) × 100%. For control purposes, an area of the cell surface without photobleaching was also analyzed for FRET. The cells transfected with HA-SNAP-25 plasmid were confirmed by detection of Cy5 fluorescence followed by incubation with primary antibody against HA and a second antibody conjugated with Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), whereas the cells transfected with GFP/SNAP-25 siRNA were identified through GFP fluorescence detection. Statistical Analysis—The quantification was based on at least three independent experiments. The results were presented as mean ± S.E. Statistics differences were determined by Student's t test for two group comparisons. SNAP-25/Syntaxin 1A Are Intrinsically Involved in the Inhibition of GAT-1 Uptake Function—It has been shown that syntaxin 1A inhibits the uptake function of GABA transporter GAT-1 in hippocampal neurons (20Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Deken S.L. Beckman M.L. Boos L. Quick M.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, 10 μm NO-711, a selective GAT-1 blocker (32Sipila S. Huttu K. Voipio J. Kaila K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5877-5880Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), eliminated 88.9 ± 7.5% of GABA uptake in primary cultured hippocampal neurons, confirming the previous report (7Jursky F. Tamura S. Tamura A. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 283-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the GABA uptake is mainly contributed by GAT-1 in hippocampal neurons. To investigate whether other SNARE proteins or SNARE complex can modulate GAT-1 uptake function, we first examined the effects of down-regulating SNARE protein expression on GAT-1 transport activity in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The suppression of syntaxin 1 or SNAP-25 expression increased the GABA uptake in hippocampal neurons by transfection with their specific siRNAs, but suppressing VAMP-2 expression did not affect the GABA uptake. Moreover, suppressing syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 expression simultaneously further increased GABA uptake but suppressing the expression of three SNARE proteins did not enhance this increase (Fig. 1B). Western blotting analysis showed that RNA interference specifically and effectively mediated the silencing of endogenous syntaxin 1A or SNAP-25 or VAMP-2 (Fig. 1B). The GABA uptake in the neurons transfected with the nonspecific siRNA (ranges from 696 to 914 fmol/min/mg protein) showed no difference from the GABA uptake in the neurons without transfection (ranges from 718 to 903 fmol/min/mg protein), indicating that the siRNA itself has no significant effect on GAT-1 uptake function (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, the GABA uptake was detected in GAT-1-GFP transfected rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12), a neuroendocrine cell line endogenously expressing the SNARE proteins (33Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) but having no detectable [3H]GABA uptake (data not shown). The addition of the fluoroprotein tags to the GAT-1 protein did not alter its subcellular distribution and uptake function (27Cai G. Salonikidis P.S. Fei J. Schwarz W. Schulein R. Reutter W. Fan H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1625-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In these experiments specific RNA interference or overexpression was used to down-regulate or up-regulate the expression of syntaxin 1A and/or SNAP-25. Our results showed that overexpression of syntaxin 1A or SNAP-25 significantly inhibited the GAT-1 uptake function, and overexpression of both proteins enhanced the inhibition (Fig. 1C). Similar to the results in hippocampal neurons, the down-regulation of syntaxin 1A and/or SNAP-25 expression greatly increased the GABA uptake in specific siRNA-transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that two target SNAREs, syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25, intrinsically inhibit GAT-1 uptake function. SNAP-25 Enhances the Syntaxin 1A-mediated Inhibition of GAT-1 Uptake Function—In order to dissect the functional relationship of syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 on the inhibition of GABA uptake, we cotransfected syntaxin 1A and/or SNAP-25 with GAT-1 in different combinations and different ratios into HEK293 cells, a cell line with no endogenous expression of GAT-1, syntaxin 1A, and SNAP-25 detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2, A and B) and no detectable [3H]GABA uptake (Fig. 3D). The cotransfection of syntaxin 1A with GAT-1 inhibited the GABA uptake, and this inhibition was promoted by increasing syntaxin 1A expression (Fig. 2A). The cotransfection of syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 with GAT-1 significantly enhanced the syntaxin 1A-mediated inhibition of GABA uptake (Fig. 2, A and B), and this enhanced inhibition was further promoted by increasing SNAP-25 expression (Fig. 2B), whereas the cells cotransfected SNAP-25 alone with GAT-1 showed no decrease of GABA uptake (Fig. 2A, the ratio of transfected GAT-1 and FLAG-syntaxin 1A plasmids is 1:0). However, the enhancement of SNAP-25 on syntaxin 1A-mediated inhibition of GAT-1 uptake function depended on the ratio of syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 expression. When the ratio of cotransfected FLAG-syntaxin 1A and HA-SNAP-25 plasmids was 0.3:1 or 1:3, SNAP-25 significantly enhanced the inhibition of GABA uptake by syntaxin 1A (inhibition from 23.6 ± 6.3% to 47 ± 3.9% or from 50.9 ± 6.8% to 74.8 ± 4.5%, respectively) (Fig. 2, A and B). These findings indicate that SNAP-25 inhibits GAT-1 uptake function in the presence of syntaxin 1A, and SNAP-25 enhances the inhibition of GAT-1 uptake function mediated by syntaxin 1A.FIGURE 3Syntaxin 1A mediates the physical and functional interactions between GAT-1 and SNAP-25.

Unlike enveloped viruses, the entry of non-enveloped viruses into cells is believed to occur without membrane fusion. In this study, we performed NMR experiments to establish the solution structure of a membrane-binding peptide from a small non-enveloped icosahedral virus. The three-dimensional structure of the FHV γ1-domain was determined at pH 6.5 and 4.0 in a hydrophobic environment. The secondary and tertiary structures were evaluated in the context of the capacity of the peptide for permeabilizing membrane vesicles of different lipid composition, as measured by fluorescence assays. At both pH values, the peptide has a kinked structure, similar to the fusion domain from the enveloped viruses. The secondary structure was similar in three different hydrophobic environments as follows: water/trifluoroethanol, SDS, and membrane vesicles of different compositions. The ability of the peptide to induce vesicle leakage was highly dependent on the membrane composition. Although the γ-peptide shares some structural properties to fusion domains of enveloped viruses, it did not induce membrane fusion. Our results suggest that small protein components such as the γ-peptide in nodaviruses (such as FHV) and VP4 in picornaviruses have a crucial role in conducting nucleic acids through cellular membranes and that their structures resemble the fusion domains of membrane proteins from enveloped viruses.

Animal viruses require a built in membrane penetration mechanism. The strategies of infection adopted by enveloped and non-enveloped viruses are different, depending on the way the virus enters and leaves a cell (1Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Chanock R.M. Melnick J.L. Monath T.P. Roizman B. Straus S.E. 3rd Ed. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 59-99Google Scholar). The cellular entry by enveloped viruses, such as influenza virus and retroviruses, is the most thoroughly studied (2Nieva J.L. Agirre A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 3Smith A.E. Helenius A. Science. 2004; 9: 237-242Crossref Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In general, infection by an enveloped virus starts with the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, mediated by viral envelope glycoproteins that contain well defined fusion domains. Fusion appears to be triggered by an optimum pH (such as the low pH at lysosomes) or by binding to a specific receptor (2Nieva J.L. Agirre A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 3Smith A.E. Helenius A. Science. 2004; 9: 237-242Crossref Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that fusion peptides tend to present a kinked region, regardless of the overall secondary structure proposed (2Nieva J.L. Agirre A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct.

The kink confers to the domain a boomerang-like structure, which can act as anchor of the virus particle to the membrane. Non-enveloped viruses do not require membrane fusion for entry into cells, but a membrane-binding motif is present in some of them (6Fricks C.E. Hogle J.M. J.

The γ1-peptide contains the 21 N-terminal residues of the 44-residue γ-peptide, a cleavage product of the coat precursor protein α. The cleavage of α occurs after assembly of FHV particles and is required for acquisition of virion infectivity, which also results in a significant increase in particle stability (15Schneemann A. Reddy V. Johnson J.E. Adv. Virus Res. 1998; 50: 381-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this lipophilic domain could be a membrane-permeabilizing agent in the viral RNA translocation process (8Bong D.T. Steinen C. Janshoff A. Johnson J.E. Ghadiri M.R. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The γ1-domain has an amphipathic character and an amino acid sequence containing several residues with short side chains, which are a common feature of fusion peptides (2Nieva J.L. Agirre A. Biochim.

Although there are few structures of fusion peptides from enveloped viruses, no solution structure is available for membrane-binding domains from small icosahedral viruses. Previous studies by NMR and biophysical methods with Flock House virus-like particles indicated that the cleaved wild type virus-like particles has a greater mobility than the uncleaved mutant because of the sharp lines of the cleaved γ-peptide (12Oliveira A.C.

In this study, we perform CD and NMR experiments to establish for the first time the solution structure of a lipid-binding domain from a small nonenveloped virus. The three-dimensional structures of γ1-peptide at pH 6.5 and pH 4.0 in a hydrophobic environment are reported. We evaluate conformational variability and membrane-permeabilizing activity by fluorescence spectroscopy at different pH values and different membrane compositions. Our results shed light into the mechanisms of how small non-enveloped particles bind to membranes and insert their genomes into the host cells. Peptides—The synthetic γ1-peptide composed of 21 residues (ASMWERVKSIIKSSLAAASNI) was purchased from Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (San Francisco). CD Spectroscopy—CD data were performed using a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer with a 2-mm path length cuvette. The spectra were recorded from 190 to 250 nm at a scanning rate of 50 nm/min with a wavelength step of 1.0 nm. Spectra were acquired for 200 μm solutions of γ1-peptide at pH 7.0, diluted with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer/water, in the presence of trifluoroethanol (10, 20, 30, and 50%) or 60 mm SDS or for 702.8 μm solutions of γ1-peptide in the presence of lipid vesicles. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR measurements were carried out at 20 °C on a Bruker Avance DRX 600 or DRX 400 spectrometer operating at 600.04 MHz. Lyophilized synthetic γ1-peptide was prepared in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and pH 4.0 containing d3-trifluoroethanol/water (1:1, v/v) and 10% D2O. Final samples contained 4.2 mm peptide at pH 6.5 and 3.6 mm peptide at pH 4.0.

The NOESY spectra were collected with 200 data points in F1 and 4096 data points in F2. The TOCSY spectra were collected with 400 data points in F1 and 4096 data points in F2. Resonances of the sample at pH 4.0 were assigned from TOCSY (MLEV-17 pulse sequence, spin lock time of 70 ms) and NOESY (mixing time 160 ms). The NOESY spectra were collected with 512 data points in F1 and 2048 data points in F2. The TOCSY spectra were collected with 300 data points in F1 and 2048 data points in F2. NMR data sets were also collected for γ1-peptide incorporated into SDS and DPC micelles. Samples were prepared by dissolving 1 mm of γ1-peptide in buffered water (pH 7.0 and 4.0) containing 160 and 300 mm SDS micelles and 2.5 mm of γ1-peptide in buffered water (pH 7.0 and 5.5) containing 120, 200, and 300 mm DPC micelles, and to each sample was added 10% D2O. For the spectra in SDS and DPC, TOCSY experiments were performed using the MLEV-17 spin-locking pulse with a mixing time of 70 ms (21Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar), and NOESY spectra were performed using a mixing time of 120 ms (22Aue W.P. Karhan J. Ernst R.R. J. Chem.

The NOESY spectra were collected with 512 data points in F1 and 2048 data points in F2 (for SDS) and with 512 data points in F1 and 4096 data points in F2 (for DPC). Water suppression for the samples was achieved by a pre-saturation pulse at the water frequency (24Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar). All spectra were recorded in time-proportioned phase increment mode (25Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). The NMR data were processed by NMRPIPE (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Zhu G. Vuister G.W. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). All NMR spectra were analyzed using NMRVIEW software package version 5.0.3 (27Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). Structure Calculation—Distance restraints were derived from the 150-ms NOESY spectrum of the peptide at pH 6.5 and the 160 ms NOESY spectrum at pH 4.0. NOE cross-peak intensities were measured and converted into distances. Structures were calculated with the program CNS-solve version 1.1. One hundred structures were calculated for each sample, using simulated annealing protocol, applying cartesian-cartesian angle molecular dynamics. The stereochemical quality of the lowest energy structures was analyzed by PROCHECK-NMR (28Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). The display, analysis, and manipulation of the three-dimensional structures were performed with the program MOLMOL (29Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). ANTS/DPX Release Assay—Peptide-induced release of aqueous vesicle content was measured by using the ANTS/DPX assay (30Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared according to the extrusion method of Hope et al. (31Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar) in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.0). LUVs containing 12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mm DPX, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm sodium phosphate were obtained by separating the unencapsulated material by gel filtration in a GPC300 column (SynChropak, Micra Scientific, Inc.) eluted with 10 mm sodium phosphate, in 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.0). Fluorescence measurements were performed by setting the ANTS emission at 523 nm and the excitation at 353 nm with a 500 nm cut-off filter in the emission beam. The absence of leakage (0%) corresponded to fluorescence of the vesicles at time 0; 100% leakage was taken as the fluorescence value obtained after addition of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The degree of permeabilization was then inferred from Equation 1, % Leakage=[(F-F0)/(FT-F0)]×100(Eq. 1) where F is the fluorescence intensity after the addition of protein; F0 is the initial fluorescence of the intact LUV suspension; and FT is the fluorescence after the addition of Triton X-100. Carboxyfluorescein Release Assay—For fluorescent probe release experiments, a self-quenching solution (100 mm)of carboxyfluorescein (2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein; Molecular Probes), 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was entrapped in l-α-phosphatidylcholine LUVs. The vesicles obtained (0.2 μm diameter) were separated from the non-incorporated probe by gel filtration using a G-75 Sephadex column (Amersham Biosciences). Measurements were performed in sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 and 7.0. The fluorescence measurements were performed in 1 ml of buffer consisting of 10 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.0, in a quartz cuvette with stirring. Fluorescence was recorded as a function of time using an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 518 nm with 2.5 nm bandwidth slits. Release was initiated by the addition of peptide and monitored by the fluorescence intensity increase after the addition of the peptide as described for the ANTS/DPX assay. γ1-Peptide-binding Domain Structure—In water (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0), the CD spectrum of γ1-peptide was that of a typical “random coil” with only one band at ∼200 nm (Fig. 1). A change from random coil to an α-helical conformation was observed when increasing amounts of TFE (up to 50%) were added to the peptide in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (Fig. 1). Double minimum bands at about 222 and 208-210 nm and a maximum band at 191-193 nm, which are characteristic of an α-helix, were observed in concentrations of 20% TFE and above. An α-helix pattern was also observed with the sample in 60 mm of SDS (Fig. 2A) or when inserted in membrane vesicles of different compositions (Fig. 2B). The high similarity of the spectra indicates that the peptide is assuming a very similar conformation in the three different media.FIGURE 2Secondary structure of γ1-peptide.

All spectra were acquired at room temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NMR studies were conducted in three different media as follows: TFE/water, SDS, and DPC. For the TFE/water condition, the NMR experiments were performed with γ1-peptide in 50% TFE/buffered water solution at pH 6.5 and pH 4.0. pH 4.0 is close to the values of the acidic lysosomal vesicular compartments. The sequence-specific assignments of γ1-peptide at pH 6.5 and pH 4.0 were carried out using NOESY, TOCSY, and COSY spectra (Fig. 3; supplemental Figs. 1S, 2S, and 3S), as proposed by Wuthrich (32Wuthrich K. Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley Interscience, New York1986Google Scholar). Despite the complexity of the spectra obtained, all residues of each peptide could be sequentially assigned via dαN(i + 1), dαN(i + 1), and dNN (i + 1) NOEs. The α-proton (αH) resonances were unambiguously identified on the basis of NOESY spectra at pH 6.5 (Fig. 4A). To locate the elements of secondary structure, chemical shifts of the αH were compared with statistical chemical shift values typical of a random coil conformation to calculate the chemical shift index deviation. The differences between the measured chemical shifts of αH and the standard values for a random coil polypeptide reveal an upfield shift of the residues Met-3 to Ile-10 and Ile-11 to Leu-15 (Fig. 5), suggesting two helical regions connected by a flexible hinge. Secondary structure content was also evaluated by medium and long range backbone 1H-1H distances (Table 1).FIGURE 4Summary of NOESY connectivities of γ1-peptide in TFE/H2O 1:1 at pH 6.5 (A) and pH 4.0 (B), 20 °C.

Open table in a new tab The NMR data set (TOCSY and NOESY) obtained from γ1-peptide incorporated into DPC (supplemental Figs. 4S-7S) and SDS (Figs. 8S and 9S) micelles displayed peaks with sharp lines but a weak dispersion of signals, not allowing complete sequence-specific assignment. In Fig. 6, the NOESY spectra of the γ1-peptide in the presence of DPC micelles at two different pH values are superimposed. Although we were able to identify some of the peaks, there was less dispersion than in TFE/water. Particularly at pH 7.0, the lines were less sharp, which could be explained by protein association (Fig. 6). To try to elucidate whether the increased peptide line widths in micelles are because of oligomerization of the peptide rather than the result of intermediate exchange between different conformations, we used different temperatures and two detergent concentrations (supplemental Figs. 6S and 7S). The data show no significant changes in the line widths at different temperatures, which would be expected in case the increased line widths were because of intermediate exchange between different conformations. The increase in detergent concentration did not result in any considerable change in line width as well. Structure Description—In general, the observation of dαN(ii + 3) together with dαβ(ii + 3) and dαN(ii + 4) connectivities suggests a stabilization of α-helical structure (Fig. 4). The NOE connectivities at pH 6.5 showed a continuous pattern of αN(ii + 3) from Trp-4 to Leu-15 and αβ(ii + 3) from Trp-4 to Val-7 and Lys-8 to Ile-11 (Fig. 4A). At pH 4.0 a continuous stretch of αN(ii + 3) was observed from Trp-4 to Ile-11 (Fig. 4B). The αβ(ii + 3) connectivities occurred from Trp-4 to Val-7 and Ile-11 to Ser-14. In addition αN(ii + 2) connectivities from Met-3 to Ser-9 also indicated a folded conformation for the N-terminal portion. αN(ii + 4) interaction was observed from Ile-11 to Leu-15 only at pH 6.5. Side chain 1H-1H distances of ii + 3, ii + 4, and long range connectivities at both pH values were also very useful for the description of the structure (Table 1). One hundred structures were calculated for each pH utilizing 179 (pH 6.5) and 208 (pH 4.0) interproton distance restraints (Table 1). The chemical shift index data and NOE connectivities showed a tendency toward helix formation in the N-terminal segment followed by a break and a second helix in the C-terminal half, at both pH values. The backbone structures of the 20 lowest energy conformers in 50% TFE at pH 6.5 and 4.0 are shown (Fig. 7). At both pH values, the peptides present a kinked structure, similar to the fusion domain from influenza hemagglutinin (4Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A helical content in the N-terminal portion and a sharp bend in the middle of the domain occur at both pH values. However, the C-terminal half has fewer observable d(ii + 3) NOE interactions, suggesting a less regular structure than the N-terminal half. There were significant differences between the structure observed at pH 6.5 and that seen at pH 4.0 with respect to the extent and position of the elements of secondary structure. At pH 6.5 the NOE connectivities indicate two distinct helical regions, from Trp-4 to Arg-6 and from Lys-12 to Leu-15. The first region shows a tendency to form a short 310-helix, which is stabilized by hydrogen bonds from the amides of Val-7 and Glu-5 to the carbonyls of Trp-4 and Met-3, respectively. In the second region, the presence of NOE connectivities between αN(ii + 3) of Ile-10 and Ser-13 and of Lys-12 and Leu-15 and between αN(ii + 4) of Ile-11 and Leu-15 strongly supports the observation of an α-helix in the 20 structures of lowest energy. However, we did not find hydrogen bonds that could stabilize a regular structure in the C-terminal portion. The residues in the center of the peptide have a slight tendency toward a helical or turn conformation based on the NOEs αN(ii + 3) between Val-7 and Ile-10, Ile-10, and Ser-13 and αβ,αγ,αδ (ii + 3) between Lys-8 and Ile-11. Indeed, this region exhibits a bend, or kink, previously found in the fusogenic fertilization peptide from sea urchin fertilization protein binding (20Glaser R.W. Grune M. Wandelt C. Ulrich A.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2560-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and in the fusion domain of the influenza hemagglutinin (4Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 19Hsu C.H. Wu S.H. Chang D.K. Chen C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 277: 22725-22733Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At pH 4.0, the N-terminal domain displays a 310-helix that extends from Glu-5 to Ser-9. This motif is stabilized by hydrogen bonds from the NHs of Ser-9, Val-7, and Met-3 to the carbonyls of Arg-6, Trp-4, and the hydroxyl of Ser-2, respectively. The NOEs αβ(ii + 3) between Ile-11 and Ser-14, αβ(ii + 4) between Lys-8 and Lys-12, and a long range connectivity between Ile-10 and Ala-16 and between Ile-11 and Leu-15 were observed exclusively at pH 4.0. The structure of the C-terminal portion of the peptide at pH 4.0 differs substantially from that proposed for pH 6.5, because there was no helical content in any of the 20 lowest energy structures. The structural difference between pH 6.5 and pH 4.0 can be attributed to neutralization of Glu-5 (protonation at low pH). The number of observed NOEs involving Glu-5 in γ1-peptide at pH 4.0 is greater than at pH 6.5 (Fig. 3; supplemental Fig. 2S). The presence of extra NOEs for Glu-5 and for other residues at pH 4.0 provides the strong evidence for the conformational differences between the two pH values. It is quite likely that negatively charged Glu-5 limits the conformational flexibility of the C-terminal portion that is more positively charged. Lipophilicity surface potential maps of the peptides at pH 6.5 and 4.0 showed the amphipathic nature of the two structures (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 also shows the arrangement of the hydrophobic residues based on the lowest energy structures at each pH value (Fig. 7, c and d). At pH 6.5, the more hydrophobic residues were observed in two major regions on each face of the molecule. Residues Trp-4, Ile-11, and Leu-15 appear on one face and residues Met-3, Trp-4, Val-7, and Ile-10 appear on the other (Fig. 7). At low pH, the polar and apolar regions are segregated so that the more hydrophobic residues mentioned above all lie on one side of the molecule (Fig. 7, right) with the more hydrophilic residues on the opposite side. Interestingly, the conformational change between pH 6.5 and pH 4.0 did not seem to affect the interaction between side chains from Lys-8 and Lys-12; they face each other at both pH values despite the differences of the chemical environment (Fig. 6). Lysine 8 and lysine 12 are of particular interest, because x-ray crystallography data from Flock House virus (33Fisher A.J. Johnson E.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) show that both side chains from these lysines contact the phosphodiest"
https://openalex.org/W1968049996,"The highly conserved branch point sequence (BPS) of UACUAAC in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is initially recognized by the branch point-binding protein (BBP). Using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment we have determined that yeast BBP binds the branch point sequence UACUAAC with highest affinity and prefers an additional adenosine downstream of the BPS. Furthermore, we also found that a stem-loop upstream of the BPS enhances binding both to an artificially designed RNA (30-fold effect) and to an RNA from a yeast intron (3-fold effect). The zinc knuckles of BBP are partially responsible for the enhanced binding to the stem-loop but do not appear to have a significant role in the binding of BBP to single-strand RNA substrates. C-terminal deletions of BBP reveal that the linker regions between the two zinc knuckles and between the N-terminal RNA binding domains (KH and QUA2 domains) and the first zinc knuckle are important for binding to RNA. The lack of involvement of the second highly conserved zinc knuckle in RNA binding suggests that this zinc knuckle plays a different role in RNA processing than enhancing the binding of BBP to the BPS.

In yeast BBP binds to the highly invariant branch point sequence UACUAAC (branch point A is underlined), recognizing every nucleotide (1Berglund J.A. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). BBP binds the BPS in the second commitment complex (CC2) and is necessary for stable formation of this complex (2Rutz B. Seraphin B. RNA. 1999; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Splicing factor 1 (SF1), the human orthologue of BBP, is a more promiscuous RNA-binding protein, recognizing a degenerate sequence, CURAY (R = purine, Y = pyrimidine), in which only the U and A are critical (1Berglund J.A. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). When discussing the yeast branch point-binding protein we will use the term BBP, when discussing the human protein we will use the term SF1, and when discussing both proteins we will use the term BBP/SF1. In the mammalian system, the equivalent complex to the yeast CC2 is the E complex in which SF1 binds the BPS (3Seraphin B. Rosbash M.

In addition to recognizing the BPS, BBP/SF1 plays an important role in bridging the 5′ end and 3′ end of the intron by interacting with U1 snRNP at the 5′ splice site and Mud2p at the 3′ end of yeast introns and U2AF65 at the 3′ end of human introns (5Berglund J.A.

BBP/SF1 contains multiple domains, many of which are conserved between yeast and human (Fig. 1). The BBP/SF1 N-terminal domain interacts with Mud2p in yeast and U2AF65 in humans (5Berglund J.A.

The C terminus contains a proline-rich domain, which in yeast interacts with Prp40, a component of the U1 snRNP (7Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). FBP11, a potential vertebrate homologue of Prp40, binds to the proline-rich domain of human SF1 (11Lin K.T. Lu R.M. Tarn W.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9176-9185Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One of the most highly conserved regions of BBP/SF1 encompasses the RNA binding domains (Fig. 1). The region of BBP/SF1 responsible for binding the BPS contains a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology (KH) domain, a QUA2 domain, and one or two zinc knuckles (1Berglund J.A. Chua K.

STAR refers to signal transduction and activation of RNA because members of this family are linked to the signal transduction pathways, whereas GSG refers to the original members of this family, GRP33, Sam68, and GLD-1. These STAR/GSG proteins contain two conserved regions called QUA1 and QUA2 that flank the maxi-KH domain. The QUA1 region of the STAR/GSG proteins is necessary for homodimerization (18Wu J. Zhou L.

Herrera C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Unlike the other members of this group, BBP/SF1 lacks the QUA1 domain and shows no ability to dimerize but still binds RNA (1Berglund J.A. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 6Rain J.C. Rafi Z. Rhani Z. Legrain P. Kramer A.

The QUA2 region is important for the stability of the maxi-KH domain (12Berglund J.A. Fleming M.L. Rosbash M. RNA. 1998; 4: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Its contact with the RNA increases the binding site size for these proteins, specifically recognizing the first adenosine in the BPS in the case of SF1, and has been shown to provide important contacts with the RNA (22Liu Z. Luyten I. Bottomley M.J. Messias A.C. Houngninou-Molango S. Sprangers R. Zanier K. Kramer A. Sattler M. Science. 2001; 294: 1098-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Orthologs of BBP/SF1 are found in nearly every eukaryotic organism, and nearly all of them contain one or two zinc knuckles of the form CX2CX4HX4C, situated C-terminal to the KH/QUA2 domains (Fig. 1). The zinc knuckles of BBP have previously been implicated in general RNA binding affinity based on truncation studies. Specific RNA binding of BBP/SF1 to the BPS was not changed by replacing the zinc knuckles with an RNA-binding peptide derived from the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein or by replacement of a short arginine-serine (RS)7 peptide (12Berglund J.A. Fleming M.L. Rosbash M. RNA. 1998; 4: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the BBP zinc knuckles are important for nonspecific binding to the phosphate backbone, whereas the KH and QUA2 domains are responsible for sequence specific binding to the BPS. Zinc knuckles have been shown to be directly involved in RNA binding in other proteins. The best studied example is the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein, which contains two zinc knuckles and binds single-stranded and stem-loop RNAs that are important for HIV genome recognition and encapsidation (23Berglund J.A.

The human SR protein 9G8, also a splicing factor, binds the 3′ splice site, and its zinc knuckle is important in RNA binding and in defining its specificity (31Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA. 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the KH and QUA2 domains of BBP specifically recognize the conserved yeast BPS of UACUAAC (1Berglund J.A. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 12Berglund J.A. Fleming M.L. Rosbash M. RNA. 1998; 4: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined if the BPS is indeed the high affinity site for the KH/QUA2 domains and if BBP binds additional RNA elements through the zinc knuckles. To determine whether the BPS is the high affinity RNA site for BBP and to identify additional nucleotides or motifs outside of the BPS, we performed an in vitro selection experiment, also known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), with a recombinant construct of S. cerevisiae BBP. To better define how the zinc knuckles of BBP bind RNA, we performed mutation and truncation studies on the zinc knuckle region of BBP. The results of this analysis are presented here. Plasmid Construction—Our previously described BBP (193) construct (12Berglund J.A. Fleming M.L. Rosbash M. RNA. 1998; 4: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), here known as BBP-331, was used as the template for subsequent BBP constructs. This construct contains amino acids 147-331, not 145-330 as previously stated in Berglund et al. (1Berglund J.A. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The BBP-269 construct (amino acids 147-269) was previously described (yBBP125 (12Berglund J.A. Fleming M.L. Rosbash M. RNA. 1998; 4: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). The same forward primer was used to amplify the PCR fragments for constructs BBP-296, BBP-287, and BBP-279, which contained the sequence 5′-GGGCCCCTGGGATCCAAATTTCAGGACAAGTATTATATCCC-3′. The reverse primers to amplify PCR fragments for constructs BBP-296, BBP-287, and BBP-279 were 5′-CCGGAATTCTCAGCCCTGTATATTTGGGATTTTTCTGTTTGGACAATCGTACCTTTTATGATCTTTTAAACC-3′,5′-CCGGAATTCTCATGGACAATCGTACCTTTTATGATCTTTTAAACC-3′, and 5′-CCGGAATTCTCATTTTAAACCACAGATTGGACAGGGCC-3′, respectively. All BBP PCR fragments were cut with BamHI at the N terminus and EcoRI at the C terminus and cloned into pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare). Both the first and the second zinc knuckles were mutated using the QuikChange PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The forward and reverse primers to mutate the first zinc knuckle (mutations C273A and C276A) were 5′-GAAGATAACAGGCCCGCTCCAATCGCTGGTTTAAAAGATCATAAAAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTTTTATGATCTTTTAAACCAGCGATTGGAGCGGGCCTGTTATCTTC-3′, respectively. For the second zinc knuckle (mutations C299A and C302A), the two QuikChange forward and reverse primers were 5′-CCAAATATACAGGGCATTGTTGCCAAAATAGCTGGACAAACTGGACATTTCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGAAATGTCCAGTTTGTCCAGCTATTTTGGCAACAATGCCCTGTATATTTGG-3′, respectively. The human SF1 (amino acids 134-297) fragment was PCR-amplified using the pGEX6P-mBBP/SF1 (1-361) as template (5Berglund J.A. Abovich N. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Primers used were 5′-CTGGGATCCACACGTGTGAGTGATAAAGTCATGATTCC-3′ and 5′-GGGGAATTCTCAAGGCCTTTGGAATTTACAGTCTGAAGCAATGTGGCC-3′. PCR fragments were flanked with BamHI and EcoRI cut sites and inserted into pGEX-6P-1. Protein Purification and Expression—All BBP and SF1 constructs were transformed into BL21(STAR) cells (Novagen). Cells were resuspended in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Cells were sonicated and spun to pellet insoluble debris at 19,800 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was added to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma #G4510) for 15 min and washed 3 times with resuspension buffer (above). Beads were washed once with 1× cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The protein of interest was cleaved from the GST tag using Precision protease (GE Healthcare). For the GST-BBP-331 construct the Precision protease cleavage was skipped and instead eluted with reduced l-glutathione (Sigma-Aldrich). BBP and SF1 constructs were purified over an ion exchange column (Mono S HR 10/10), concentrated, and dialyzed into protein storage buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 15% glycerol). SELEX—The protocol used for the BBP SELEX was modeled after other SELEX experiments previously described (32Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8178) Google Scholar, 33Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1990; 346: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (7745) Google Scholar), with our experimental details described below. First, 25 pmol (1.5 × 1013 molecules) of the template oligonucleotide, 5′-GGGAATGGATCCACATCTACGAATTCN30TTCACTGCAGACTTGACGAAGCTT-3′ was amplified with 8 rounds of PCR with primers, 5′-GATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAATGGATCCACATCTACGA-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTCGTCAAGTCTGCAGTGAA-3′. The PCR reaction was then phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. The DNA template was resuspended in 50 μl of water and spun through a Bio-Spin 6 size exclusion cartridge. The DNA template concentration was calculated using the A260. A library of 1 × 1013 molecules of DNA template was used for the in vitro transcription reaction. The RNA pool was transcribed as previously described (34Smith C.W.J. Hames B.D. RNA:Protein Interactions, A Practical Approach. The Practical Approach Series. 128, and 129, Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 40-43Google Scholar). The RNA pool was cleaned up by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The RNA pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of water and spun through a Bio-Spin 6 size exclusion cartridge. The DNA template was removed by adding DNase (Promega) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The RNA pool was again cleaned with another round of phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, resuspended, and spun through a Bio-Spin 6 size exclusion cartridge. GST-BBP-331 was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 30 min and washed 3 times with binding buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.07 mg/ml tRNA from bakers' yeast, Sigma) to remove any unbound protein. The purified RNA pool was added to the GST-BBP-331 protein bound to the glutathione-agarose beads in binding buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Unbound RNAs were removed by washing three times with binding buffer. Bound RNAs were eluted by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The eluted RNAs were resuspended in 20 μl of water. The selected RNAs were reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and the reverse primer, 5′-AAGCTTCGTCAAGTCTGCAGTGAA-3′, at 42 °C for 30 min. A new round of SELEX was begun again with PCR amplification. A total of seven rounds were done. Concentration of RNA and protein for the different rounds of SELEX were as shown in Table 1. After the last round the PCR fragments were ligated into TOPO TA-2.1 vector and then transformed into TG1 competent cells (Stratagene). 48 individual colonies were picked and sequenced.TABLE 1Concentration of RNA and protein for the different rounds of SELEXRoundRNAProteinμMμM118622023101450.552.50.2561.00.170.50.05 Open table in a new tab Gel Shift Assays—RNAs were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase or in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and internally labeled with [α-32P]CTP, purified on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and cleaned up using Bio-Rad P6 spin columns. Binding buffer consisted of 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.07 mg/ml tRNA. Experiments performed under more stringent binding conditions contained a modified binding buffer with 200 mm NaCl and 0.5 mg/ml tRNA (bakers' yeast from Sigma); the other components are as stated above. The radiolabeled oligonucleotide was at an approximate concentration of 0.1 nm. Free RNA and protein-RNA complexes were separated on 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA 6% polyacrylamide gels run at 150 V for 2 h at 4 °C. The gel shift assay was repeated three times for each RNA substrate. Gels were dried and exposed on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of fraction of RNA bound was done using ImageQuant. Data were plotted in Kaleidagraph, and data points were fit to the following equation to calculate an approximate Kd: fraction RNA bound = ((Kd + [RNAtotal] + [SF1total]) - (-Kd - [RNAtotal] - [SF1total])2 - (4([SF1total][RNAtotal]))1/2)/(2[RNAtotal]). CD Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism experiments were performed on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. CD spectra were recorded at protein concentrations of 0.02-0.04 mg/ml in a buffer of 20 mm K2HPO4 (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl. The spectra were taken using a speed of 5 nm/min in a 1-cm cell at 4 °C. All spectra represent the average of four separate scans and are plotted in molar ellipticity (degree cm2 dmol-1) after the subtraction of buffer scans. Selection of High Affinity RNA Sites for BBP—We made a GST-tagged BBP construct containing the RNA binding domains (KH, QUA2, and both zinc knuckles, amino acids 147-331; Fig. 1). We refer to this construct as GST-BBP-331. We then performed seven rounds of SELEX with GST-BBP-331 and a library of RNAs containing a 30-nucleotide randomized region. Selection for higher affinity targets was observed; pool 7 RNA bound BBP-331 (lacking GST) with 50-fold higher affinity than pool zero RNA (Fig. 2). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed on pool 7 RNA, and 48 individual clones were picked and sequenced. Fig. 3A shows that all 48 sequences are unique and that all of these clones except one contain the highly conserved yeast branch point sequence UACUAAC. The one clone lacking the yeast BPS has a very similar sequence of UAUUAAC (see Fig. 3A, sequence 48).FIGURE 3SELEX results for BBP. A, the alignment of SELEX sequences for BBP (147-331) is separated into three groups. The UACUAAC motif is highlighted in red. Group I contains the GRUGG (R = purine) motif before the UACUAAC sequence, which is marked with an underline. Group II consists of the UACUAAC motif repeated twice within the randomized region. Group III contains just the UACUAAC motif and no common structural motif. B, the Web-logo consensus sequence of the 48 SELEX sequences was generated at the weblogo website. The size of the letters indicates degree of conservation. C, a representation of the common secondary structure and sequence motif of the group I RNAs. The gray portion represents the constant terminal region, and the black indicates the randomized sequence of the SELEX RNAs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the selected sequences reveals that BBP has a preference for an adenosine downstream of the BPS sequence. This observation is consistent with two bioinformatic analyses which showed that an adenosine is overrepresented in yeast introns at the nucleotide immediately 3′ of the BPS as well as a biochemical study showing an adenosine at this position enhances splicing efficiency (35Rain J.C. Legrain P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Spingola M. Grate L. Haussler D. Ares Jr., M. RNA. 1999; 5: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 37Lopez P.J. Seraphin B. RNA. 1999; 5: 1135-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that BBP recognizes this adenosine in yeast introns. Our data also reveal a preference for guanosines upstream of the BPS (Fig. 3B). We divided the 48 sequences into three groups based on sequence and structural differences. The nine group I sequences contain a conserved motif GRUGG (R = purine) directly upstream of the BPS. The first four nucleotides of this motif, GRUG, can base pair with CAUC in the 5′ constant terminal sequence of the SELEX RNA to form a potential stem-loop containing different loop sizes. All sequences contain a single guanosine between the stem-loop and BPS (Fig. 3C). Secondary structure predictions were done using mfold (38Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar, 39Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10412) Google Scholar). The seven group II sequences contain UACUAAC repeated twice, and one of these sequences (#12) is also predicted to have a stem-loop structure present in the RNA in a similar position as seen in group I. The linker between the stem-loop and the UACUAAC motif in sequence #12 is two nucleotides instead of one compared with group I sequences. The other 32 sequences fall into group III and contain the UACUAAC motif and lack any common secondary structure. We picked two sequences from each group for gel shift assays to compare binding affinities between the three groups (Fig. 4). RNAs #1 and #7 from group I bind BBP-331 with the highest affinity. Kd values are well below 1 nm (Fig. 4A). It was not possible to determine a Kd for these RNAs because the RNA concentration could not be reduced sufficiently for an accurate measurement to be made. RNAs #12 and #14 from group II bind with approximate Kd values of 300 and 740 pm, respectively (Fig. 4B). As predicted, we observed two complexes forming with BBP-331, indicating that BBP is able to bind both sites simultaneously. A distinct possibility for RNA #14 had been that only one BBP would be able to bind because the two UACUAAC sites lack a linker (Fig. 3A), but clearly BBP is able to bind both UACUAAC motifs simultaneously. RNA #12 binds with 2.5-fold stronger affinity than RNA #14 possibly because RNA #12 contains a potential stem-loop two nucleotides upstream of the first UACUAAC site. From group III, RNAs #33 and #43 were used for analysis, and their Kd values for BBP-331 are 4 and 1.4 nm (Fig. 4C). In general, we found that group I binds with the highest affinity to BBP, possibly due to the upstream stem-loop, whereas group II binds with the next highest level of affinity, likely due to the duplicate UACUAAC sites, and group III binds BBP with the lowest relative affinity for the SELEX RNAs. To test the role of the upstream stem-loop in high affinity binding to BBP, we designed two 24-nucleotide RNAs, yBP24-SL and yBP24-SS, and compared their binding (Fig. 5A). The yBP24-SL RNA contains an artificially designed stem-loop positioned a single guanosine nucleotide upstream of a UACUAAC motif, whereas yBP24-SS lacks the stem-loop (see Fig. 5A). To ensure the stability of the stem-loop in yBP24-SL, a stable UUCG tetraloop was used to cap the stem (40Antao V.P. Tinoco Jr., I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 41Antao V.P. Lai S.Y. Tinoco Jr., I.

Tinoco Jr., I. Brody E.N. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1364-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The yBP24-SS RNA is similar to yBP24-SL except for point mutations that disrupt the stem-loop (Fig. 5A). The difference in binding affinity between yBP24-SL (Fig. 5, lanes 1-8) and yBP24-SS (Fig. 5, lanes 9-16) is more than 30-fold under stringent conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). The stem-loop RNA has a Kd of 4 nm, and the single-stranded UACUAAC RNA binds with a Kd of 156 nm. Under less stringent conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”), the difference in binding between yBP24-SL and yBP24-SS is 10-fold (data not shown). To determine whether a stem-loop upstream of the BPS in a yeast intron enhances BBP binding we tested the binding of an RNA from a yeast intron containing a putative stem-loop upstream of the BPS. The region upstream of several yeast introns was folded with mfold (38Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar, 39Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10412) Google Scholar) to identify candidates that contain a stem-loop upstream of the BPS that might function to enhance BBP RNA binding as we observed with the SELEX RNAs. From our search, we picked one good candidate for additional studies, the intron of the LSm gene (accession number NC_001134.7). The LSm intron contains a putative stem-loop directly upstream of the BPS (Fig. 6). We found mutating the yeast LSm stem-loop has a more than 3-fold effect on binding (lanes 9-16). The Kd to the LSm WT RNA is 110 nm and increases to 367 nm for the LSm mutant RNA. Compensatory mutations that restore the stem, bring BBP binding back to wild type levels with a Kd of 103 nm supporting the formation of the stem-loop and indicating its presence enhances the binding of BBP to this RNA. These studies in combination with those in Fig. 5 clearly indicate BBP binding is enhanced by the presence of a stem-loop upstream of the BPS. The different effects the UUCG and LSm stem-loops exert on BBP binding suggest the location, stability, and possibly t"
https://openalex.org/W2073261787,"The homo-24-meric dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2) scaffold of the human branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) contains the lipoyl-bearing domain (hbLBD), the subunit-binding domain (hbSBD) and the inner core domain that are linked to carry out E2 functions in substrate channeling and recognition. In this study, we employed NMR techniques to determine the structure of hbSBD and dynamics of several truncated constructs from the E2 component of the human BCKDC, including hbLBD (residues 1-84), hbSBD (residues 111-149), and a di-domain (hbDD) (residues 1-166) comprising hbLBD, hbSBD and the interdomain linker. The solution structure of hbSBD consists of two nearly parallel helices separated by a long loop, similar to the structures of the SBD isolated from other species, but it lacks the short 310 helix. The NMR results show that the structures of hbLBD and hbSBD in isolated forms are not altered by the presence of the interdomain linker in hbDD. The linker region is not entirely exposed to solvent, where amide resonances associated with ∼50% of the residues are observable. However, the tethering of these two domains in hbDD significantly retards the overall rotational correlation times of hbLBD and hbSBD, changing from 5.54 ns and 5.73 ns in isolated forms to 8.37 ns and 8.85 ns in the linked hbDD, respectively. We conclude that the presence of the interdomain linker restricts the motional freedom of the hbSBD more significantly than hbLBD, and that the linker region likely exists as a soft rod rather than a flexible string in solution.

Vogelstein B. Childs B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 8th. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). The reaction products are indirectly channeled into the Krebs cycle or linked to lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis. In patients with inherited maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), the activity of the BCKDC is deficient, which results in the accumulation of branched-chain α-ketoacids and amino acids (3Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Vogelstein B. Childs B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 8th. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). This metabolic block has severe clinical consequences including often fatal ketoacidosis, neurological derangement, and mental retardation in survivors. The human BCKDC is a four-million Da catalytic machine. There are three catalytic components in human BCKDC: a heterotetrameric (α2β2) branched chain α-ketoacid decarboxylase/dehydrogenase (E1), a homo-24-meric dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2), and a homodimeric dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). E1 and E2 components are specific for the BCKDC, whereas the E3 component is common among the three α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes (1Reed L.J. Damuni Z. Merryfield M.L. Curr. Top Cell Regul. 1985; 27: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The BCKDC is organized around the cubic E2 scaffold, to which 12 copies of E1, unspecified copies of E3, the BCKD kinase and the BCKD phosphatase are attached through ionic interactions (4Harris R.A. Hawes J.W. Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Sato J. Haskiewicz J. Hurley T.D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 271-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The E2 component of human BCKDC is a modular protein carrying three independently folded domains, which are tethered together by flexible interdomain linker regions. The three domains are: the N-terminal lipoyl-bearing domain (hbLBD, residues 1-84), the interim E1/E3 subunit binding domain (hbSBD, residues 111-149), and the C-terminal inner core domain (hbICD, residues 175-421) (5Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The hbLBD carries the lipoamide prosthetic group and serves as a “swing arm” to transfer the acyl group from E1 to the E2 active site, where the reaction intermediate is converted to acyl-CoA (6Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Similar to LBDs from other members of the α-ketoacid dehydrogenase family, the structure of hbLBD is a flattened β-barrel formed by two four-stranded anti-parallel β sheets (7Dardel F. Davis A.D. Laue E.D. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Chang C.-F. Chou H.-T. Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Huang T.-h. J. Biol.

The lipoyl Lys44 residue resides at the tip of a β-hairpin comprising a sharp β-turn that ties β-strands 4 and 5. The hbICD harbors the sub-unit binding site and forms a 24-meric cubic structure (11Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Schulze E. Kalk K.H. Westphal A.H. de Kok A. Hol W. Science. 1992; 255: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The hbSBD is connected to the C terminus of hbLBD through a ∼26-residue flexible linker and to the N terminus of hbICD by a ∼25-residue tether. The hbSBD is the smallest globular protein domain known without disulfide bridges, metal ions, or prosthetic groups. The mammalian hbSBD binds E1 or E3 with different affinities of 10-8 m and 10-6 m, respectively. The chain folds of SBD from the Escherichia coli 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (eoSBD) (12Robien M.A. Clore G.M. Omichinski J.G. Perham R.N. Appella E. Sakaguchi K. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3463-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the B. stearothermophilus (also called Geobacillus stearothermophilus) PDC (bpSBD) have been determined previously by NMR spectroscopy (13Kalia Y.N. Brocklehurs S.M. Hipps D.S. Appella E. Sakaguchi K. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 323-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Each of these SBD is made up of two parallel helices, a five-residue helix-like turn and an irregular loop. The crystal structures of bpSBD in complex with E1 (14Frank R.A.W. Pratap J.V. Pei X.Y.

Structure. 1996; 4: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) from the B. stearothermophilus PDC have also been solved. The structural information validates the view that E1 and E3 compete for essentially the same set of determinants in the E2 component of the B. stearothermophilus PDC (16Lessard I.A.D. Fuller C. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16863-16870Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) Unlike their prokaryotic counterparts, the mammalian and yeast PDCes employ SBD and a specific E3-binding protein (E3BP) to bind E1 and E3 components, respectively (17Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38329-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of E3 bound to the E3 binding domain (hpE3BD) of E3BP from the human PDC has been elucidated (18Brautigam C.A. Wynn R.M. Chuang J.L. Machius M. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T.

Whereas chain folds are conserved between hpE3BD and prokaryotic SBD, determinants in hpE3BD for binding human E3 differ from those in prokaryotic SBD for interactions with their cognate E3 (18Brautigam C.A. Wynn R.M. Chuang J.L. Machius M. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. Structure. 2006; 14: 611-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, to date the three-dimensional structure of hbSBD from the human BCKDC has not been reported. This information is essential for understanding the modes of E1 and E3 binding to the E2 core of the BCKDC catalytic machine. In the present study, we employed multidimensional hetero-nuclear NMR techniques to determine the structures of hbSBD and dynamics of hbLBD, hbSBD, and a di-domain (hbDD, residues 1-168) containing both hbLBD and hbSBD domains and the interdomain linker region. We showed that the structures of the two domains are not perturbed by the presence of the linker. Although the linker region is disordered, it retains certain rigidity and thus imposes structural constraints that restrain the relative motion of the two domains. Analysis of backbone 15NT1, 15NT2, and 1H-15N NOE relaxation data further indicate that the dynamics of hbLBD is not significantly altered as a result of linking together the two domains. By comparison, hbSBD is less rigid and its dynamics is therefore affected more noticeably by the presence of the linker region. Sample Preparation—Three recombinant proteins containing various E2 domains were studied in this article, the di-domain protein (hbDD, residues 1-166), the lipoyl-bearing domain protein (hbLBD, residues 1-84), and the subunit binding domain protein (hbSBD, residues 104-152). To facilitate protein expression and purification, the genes for hbDD and hbLBD were constructed such that each of the expressed recombinant proteins contains an extra methionine residue at the N terminus (at the-1 position), and a leucine, a glutamic acid along with six histidine residues at the C terminus. To produce the hbSBD protein, a tobacco-etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site was cloned in the linker region of hbDD between positions 103 and 104. The cells harboring various plasmids were grown in LB medium with 0.025 mg/ml kanamycin at 30 °C. The culture was grown to A600 of 0.6 prior to induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in a lysis buffer at pH 8, and lysed in a microfluidizer. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant purified by HIS-select Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). The column was washed with buffer at pH 7.5 containing 100 mm KCl and 50 mm KH2PO4. The target protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The proteins were further purified to homogeneity by size exclusion chromatography using Sephacryl S-100 column in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. The Sephacryl S-100 column was connected to an AKTA fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (Amersham Biosciences). To produce isotopically labeled samples for NMR structural determination, the cell was cultured in M9 minimal medium, supplemented with 15NH4Cl (1g/liter), 13C-labeled glucose (2g/liter), and 13C/5N-labeled Celtone base powder (0.5 g/liter, Spectra Stable Isotopes). To produce hbSBD the Ni-NTA-purified di-domain protein was digested with the TEV protease and the His6-tagged protein isolated using the Ni-NTA resin. The purified hbSBD contains an extra glycine in front of Glu104, which was left behind after the TEV cleavage. The purified protein was better than 95% pure, based on Coomassie Blue-stained gels. The NMR samples contained ∼1-2 mm protein in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, and 10% (v/v) D2O. To prepare D2O samples, concentrated protein solutions were lyophilized and redissolved in D2O. NMR Experiments, Spectral Analysis, and Structure Calculation—NMR experiments were carried out at 295 K on Bruker AVANCE-600 or AVANCE-500 NMR spectrometers (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany), both equipped with field gradient accessories. The experimental parameters employed the heteronuclear three-dimensional experiments CBCANH, CBCA-(CO)NH, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, 1H-15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC, and 1H-13C-edited HCCH-TOCSY were as described previously (8Chang C.-F. Chou H.-T. Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Huang T.-h. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15865-15873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All data were processed and further analyzed using Bruker XWINNMR and AURELIA software packages (Karlsruhe, Germany). Proton chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) at 0 ppm. The 15N and 13C chemical shift values were calculated using consensus ratios of 0.101329118 for 15N/1H and 0.251449530 for 13C/1H (20Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). NOE distance restraints were based on two-dimensional NOESY, three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments with a 120-ms mixing time. NOE peak regions were picked and quantified using the automatic picking routine of AURELIA. Automated NOE cross-peak assignments were performed using the CANDID module of CYANA (21Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar), and backbone torsion angles were predicted from TALOS (22Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Structure calculation was done using CYANA 2.0.19. One hundred random conformers were annealed in 10,000 steps for each cycle, and 20 structures with lowest target function in cycle 7 were selected for further analysis with programs MOLMOL (23Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK-NMR (24Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4419) Google Scholar). 15N T1, 15N T2, and steady state heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE data were obtained at 295 K using standard pulse sequences (25Kay L.E. Nicholson L. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D. J. Magn. Resonance. 1992; 97: 39-375Google Scholar). Two sets of T1 and T2 experiments, and three pairs of the steady-state heteronuclear NOE experiments were collected at 600 MHz (14.1 T). Relaxation Data Analysis—Relaxation rates and heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE enhancements were calculated from peak heights of the resonances in a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The AURELIA program was employed for data analysis, including peak picking and peak intensity determination. Errors in 1H-15N NOE were expressed as the standard deviation of three pairs of repeated 1H-15N NOE experiments. The longitudinal and transverse relaxation rate constant, R1 and R2, were obtained by the two parameter nonlinear optimization of a single exponential function using the Marquardt-based nonlinear least-square curve-fitting algorithm. Uncertainties were obtained from curve fitting with the Prism 3.00 program (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Reduced Spectral Density Analysis—Dynamic parameters were contained in the spectral density function, J(ω) at five frequencies: 0, ωN, ωH-ωN, ωH, and ωH + ωN. An assumption was made that J(ω) = λ1/ω2 + λ2, where the first and second terms represent contributions to J(ω) from the overall rotation and internal dynamics, respectively. By substituting a single value of J(0.87ωH) for linear combinations of J(ωH-ωN), J(ωH) and J(ωH + ωN) (26Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Szabo A. Torchia D.A. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), three spectral density functions: J(0), J(ωN), and J(0.870ωH), were determined from the experimental data for T1,T2, and NOE (27Lefevre L.-F. Dayie K.T. Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochem-istry. 1996; 35: 2674-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (28Ishima R. Nagayama K. J. Magn. Resonance B. 1995; 108: 73-76Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar), according to Equations 1-4,J(0)=[6R2-3R1-2.72σNH]/[3d2+4c2]J(ωN)=[4R1-5σNH]/[3d2+4c2]J(0.87ωH)=4σNH/5d2σNH=R1(NOE-1)γN/γH where R1 and R2 are the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates, respectively; d=(μohγNγH/8π2)(rNH-3);c=ωNΔσ/3; μo is the permeability in vacuum; h is Planck's constant; γH and γN are the nuclear gyric ratios of 1H and 15N, respectively; ωN and ωH are the Larmor frequencies of 1H and 15N, respectively; Δσ =-170 ppm is the 15N chemical shift anisotropy of polypeptide chains (29Hiyama Y. Niu C.H. Silverston J.V. Bavavo A. Torchia D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 2378-2383Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For rigid globule molecules, the overall rotational correlation time τc was obtained from spectral density functions from Equation 5 (30Bracken C. Carr P.A. Cavanagh J. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2133-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).τc2=ωN-2[J(0)-J(ωN)]/J(ωN) Solution Structures of hbSBD—Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence and the secondary structure of the di-domain (hbDD, residues 1-166) of the E2 component from human BCKDC. The hbDD consists of three functional regions: the lipoyl-binding domain (hbLBD, residues 1-84), the linker region (residues 85-110) and the subunit-binding domain (hbSBD, residues 111-149). Fig. 2A shows the 15N HSQC spectrum and resonance assignments of a clone containing the hbSBD domain (residues 104-152). The assignments of the main chain HN, NH,Cα,Cβ, and C′ resonances of hbSBD and hbDD were based on CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO experiments. The assignments of side chain resonances were achieved by the analysis of 1H-15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and 1H-13C-edited HCCH-TOCSY spectra. More than 80% of the spin systems and nearly all 1H, 15N, and 13C backbone resonances of hbSBD were assigned. The NMR assignment data have been deposited in BMRB (accession number 7057).FIGURE 2A, two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectrum of u-15N hbSBD at 295 K. The horizontal lines connect the pairs of the side chain NH2 resonances of Asn and Gln residues. The NMR sample contained 1 mm protein in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, and 10% (v/v) D2O. The spectrum was obtained in a Bruker AVANCE600 spectrometer.

Residues that impart hydrophobic interactions to stabilize the two helices are depicted in a stick representation. These are: Ala115, Val116, Leu119, and Asn123 from helix H1 and Lys141, Ile144, and Leu148 from helix H2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The tertiary structure of hbSBD was determined from 634 distance restraints assigned by CYANA and 48 torsion angles (24ψ, 24φ). The superposition of the resultant family of 20 best structures of the hbSBD is shown in Fig. 2B. The coordinates have been deposited in PDB/RCSB (PDB accession number: 1ZWV). The structural statistics are given under supplemental materials. These structures have the total target function ranging from 0.02 to 0.15 (Å2). The average root mean square deviations (RMSD) for backbone atoms are 0.28 ± 0.08 Å for the well defined secondary structure regions (Pro114-Glu122, Lys141-Glu149) and 0.41 ± 0.10 Å for the segment over residues 114-149. The average RMSD is 0.91 ± 0.11 Å for heavy atoms and 1.00 ± 0.09 Å relative to the mean structure. The quality of these structures is good as judged by the fact that 100% of the backbone torsion angles for non-glycine and non-proline residues fall in either the most favorable (76.4%) or the allowed regions (23.6%) of the Ramachandran plot (24Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4419) Google Scholar). The ribbon representation of the tertiary fold of hbSBD (Fig. 2C) shows that the two parallel helices, i.e. helix H1 (Pro114-Glu122) and helix H2 (Lys141-Glu149), were stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions between Ala 115, Val116, Leu119, Asn123 in H1 and Lys141, Ile144, Leu146 in H2. The two helices also interact with the long loop between them through the following hydrophobic interactions: Val116 → Ile139 and Leu140; Ala120 → Ile125 and Leu127; Ile144 and Leu148 → Ile125, and Ile144 → Val130. However, the structure of the long loop is less defined than the helical structure regions. No long range NOE was observed for the six N-terminal residues of the linker region (residues 104-109), suggesting that this segment is disordered. Effect of the Linker Domain on the Structures of hbLBD and hbSBD—To probe possible structural effects caused by the tethering of hbLBD and hbSBD as in natural E2, we obtained the 15N HSQC spectrum of hbDD (Fig. 3A) and compared it with those of hbLBD (Fig. 1 in Ref. 8Chang C.-F. Chou H.-T. Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Huang T.-h. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15865-15873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and hbSBD (Fig. 2A). The result shows that the bulk of resonances observed in hbLBD and hbSBD are present in the same positions as in the di-domain spectrum. It indicates that the overall tertiary folds of hbLBD and hbSBD were not affected by linking these two domains as in hbDD. However, significant chemical shift changes were observed in several resonances, suggesting the existence of structural perturbations. To identify the regions affected we have further assigned all resonances in Fig. 3A. Fig. 3B shows the chemical shift differences in amide resonances between those observed in hbDD and the corresponding resonances in hbLBD and hbSBD. The values are calculated with the equation: Δδ = [(ΔδNH)2 + (0.154ΔδN)2]1/2, where ΔδNH and ΔδN are the chemical shift differences for NH and 15N, respectively (31Ayed A. Mulder F.A.A. Yi G.-S. Lu Y. Kay L.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2001; 8: 756-760Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The result showed that chemicals shift perturbations of all residues in hbLBD are less than 0.1 ppm suggesting the structure of hbLBD is not perturbed by the tethering of the linker to its C terminus (Fig. 3B). The three internal residues, Ile11, Ser42, and Leu82, exhibit slightly larger chemical shift perturbations (>0.05 ppm) than remaining residues in the hbLBD domain. The locations of Ile11, Ser42, and Leu82 are shown in Fig. 3C. Interestingly, residues Ile11 and Ser42 are located in the vicinity of the lipoic acid attachment site of Lys44 β-hairpin region that is away from the C terminus (8Chang C.-F. Chou H.-T. Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Huang T.-h. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15865-15873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the chemical shift perturbations of these two residues might indicate the presence of certain degree of interactions between the hairpin region and other part(s) of the di-domain. In contrast, tethering hbSBD through the inter-domain linker causes considerable overall chemical perturbations in the hbSBD domain. As shown in Fig. 3B, Gly107, Leu127, and Leu148 exhibit the largest changes in chemical shift (Δδ > 0.1 ppm) among the residues within hbSBD with Arg108, Leu111, Ala112, Thr113, Glu142, and Leu145 also perturbed significantly (0.1 ppm >Δδ > 0.05 ppm). Gly107 is part of the disorder linker and its very large chemical shift change is expected. Leu127 is located in the long loop region between the two helices and Leu148 is located on helix 2 near the C terminus of hbSBD (Fig. 3D). The structure indicates that the long loop is located close to the N terminus and there are extensive interactions between these two regions. Thus, the conformational change in the N terminus of hbSBD caused by the presence of the linker region is likely to be transmitted to the loop region containing Leu127. The extended C-terminal linker residues (∼25 amino acids) of hbDD in turn could interact with helix 2, where Glu142, Leu145, and Leu148 reside. However, we cannot discount the possibility that some of the chemical shift perturbations are caused by interaction with other part of the di-domain. It is also worth mentioning that mixing u-15N hbLBD and u-15N hbSBD samples causes no change in chemical shifts in the 15N HSQC spectra of hbLBD and hbSBD, suggesting that the linker and the C-terminal residues of hbSBD are required for the observed changes to occur. Furthermore, the CSI plot of hbDD shows that secondary structures of the linked hbLBD and hbSBD are identical to those of the two corresponding isolated domains. Some resonances in the 8.3 ± 0.5 ppm (1H) region are attributed to residues Ser85, Glu86, Val89, Val90, Glu91, Thr92, Ala94, Ser96, Asp98, Glu99, His100, Thr101,Gly107,Arg108, and Thr110 in the linker region (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the consecutive sequence of five residues from His102 to Ile106 cannot be observed, suggesting that this segment is exposed. Dynamics of hbLBD, hbSBD, and hbDD—Shown on the left panels of Fig. 4 (A-C) are the 15NR1, 15NR2, and 1H-15N NOE relaxation data of hbDD (open circles), hbLBD (residues 1-84, filled circles), and hbSBD (residues 104-152, filled circles), obtained at 600 MHz (1H). The average values of the relaxation parameters (R1, R2, NOE) at 295 K are: (1.60 ± 0.06 s-1, 12.47 ± 0.70 s-1, 0.66 ± 0.03), (2.05 ± 0.05 s-1, 8.31 ± 0.34 s-1, 0.77 ± 0.03), and (2.91 ± 0.08 s-1, 11.87 ± 0.40 s-1, 0.72 ± 0.02) for hbDD, hbLBD, and hbSBD, respectively. The average values of these parameters for the hbLBD and hbSBD domains in hbDD are (1.53 ± 0.04 s-1, 11.73 ± 0.51 s-1, 0.74 ± 0.03), and (1.64 ± 0.07 s-1, 15.21 ± 1.13 s-1, 0.72 ± 0.04), respectively. Although the amide resonances of several residues in the linker region could be assigned, the considerable overlap of these residues (Fig. 3A) prevented unambiguous determinations of their relaxation parameters. The T2 values of these resonances were also very short and reliable relaxation data could not be obtained. These results suggest that the linker region is disordered and partially exposed to the solvent. The relaxation data profile of hbLBD and the corresponding domain in hbDD are practically identical indicating the internal dynamics remains unchanged between the free and linked hbLBD. However, the R2 values of hbLBD in the di-domain are higher than those of isolated hbLBD, and the situation is reversed for the R1 profile, as a result of increases in the rotational correlation time in hbDD (see “Discussion” below). On the other hand, hbSBD shows more fluctuation than hbLBD both as a free domain and as a moiety of the di-domain. The ordering of the N-terminal region from the hbSBD domain in hbDD can be clearly discerned by the increase in NOE magnitude for the hbSBD residues. To quantitatively assess the dynamic behavior of hbSBD, the reduced spectral density functions (J values) of the three domain constructs (free hbLBD, free hbSBD and hbDD) were calculated. The J values reflect the degree of motion in given frequency regions. Thus, the higher the value of J(ω), the more extensive m"

In antigen presentation, proteasomes generate a set of short peptides that are closely related and overlapping and in some instances may even have identical retention times and identical masses. In these situations, micro-liquid chromatography-MS/MS focused on each theoretical parent ion followed by manual interpretation optimizes the identification of generated peptides. The results suggest that the degradation of short antigens by the proteasome occurs by sequential cleavage.

In these situations, micro-liquid chromatography-MS/MS focused on each theoretical parent ion followed by manual interpretation optimizes the identification of generated peptides. The results suggest that the degradation of short antigens by the proteasome occurs by sequential cleavage. Recognition of virus-infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes requires prior proteolytic processing of viral proteins (1York I.A. Goldberg A.L. Mo X.Y. Rock K.L. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This degradation generates short peptides that are translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen by transporters associated with antigen processing, assembled with major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain and β2-microglobulin, and transported to the cell membrane (1York I.A. Goldberg A.L. Mo X.Y. Rock K.L. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In infected cells, processing predominantly takes place in the cytosol by the combined action of proteasomes and degradative peptidases. Processing generates a broad diversity of peptides including a small fraction of the correct epitope or N-terminally extended precursors (1York I.A. Goldberg A.L. Mo X.Y. Rock K.L. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) that are utilized for major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation. These epitope precursor peptides require N-terminal trimming by aminopeptidases either in the cytosol or in the endoplasmic reticulum (2Saveanu L. Fruci D. van Endert P. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We are interested in the identification of the set of processed peptides generated from short viral proteins by antigen processing by the proteasome and/or other proteases. In a previous work (3López D. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5769-5772PubMed Google Scholar), we studied antigen processing from recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding two closely related minigene products encompassing murine cytomegalovirus pp89 immunodominant nonamer epitope (4Del Val M. Volkmer H. Rothbard J.B. Jonjic S. Messerle M. Schickedanz J. Reddehase M.J. Koszinowski U.H. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3965-3972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using protease inhibitors, we defined a role for proteasomes in physiological intracellular antigen processing of short antigens. One of the minigenes (m19) codes for a 19-mer peptide, MDIGAYPHFMPTNLAGDPY. It represents the immunodominant murine cytomegalovirus 9pp89 epitope (YPHFMPTNL) and the local flanking amino acids of HBe carrier protein. In addition, it presents a biterminal alanine spacer between the 9pp89 core and HBe flanking residues, which was previously reported to enhance antigenicity (5Eggers M. Boesfabian B. Ruppert T. Kloetzel P.M. Koszinowski U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this classic paper Eggers et al. (5Eggers M. Boesfabian B. Ruppert T. Kloetzel P.M. Koszinowski U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) characterized the proteasome digestion products of this m19 peptide. The authors identified two cleavage products; the 1–14 peptide (MDIGAYPHFMPTNL) as the major degradation product and also the 9pp89 epitope (6YPHFMPTNL14) were detected. As the proteasome is a multicatalytic protease with three different activities (6Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar), some authors have demonstrated a broad spectrum of processed peptides generated by the action of this protease on different proteins (reviewed in Ref. 7Kloetzel P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we can expect higher diversity in m19 cleavage experiments that are revealed with the classic MS 2The abbreviations used are: MS, mass spectrometry; LC, liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray ionization; IT, ion trap; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. analysis (5Eggers M. Boesfabian B. Ruppert T. Kloetzel P.M. Koszinowski U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the last years immunoproteomics or mass spectrometry-based methods to study the targets of the immune response have been developed (8Purcell A.W. Gorman J.J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 193-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). With the standard automated micro-LC-MS/MS scan mode we detected four m19-derived cleavage products. Therefore we modified this technical approach involving micro-LC-MS/MS focused on each theoretical parental cleavage product followed by manual interpretation, and thus we optimize the detection of generated peptides. This strategy allow the identification of nine cleavage products. With these data, we suggest a sequential cleavage model for proteasome activity on the m19 peptide. Synthetic Peptides—The peptides were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer model 433A (Foster City, CA), purified, and found homogeneous by HPLC analysis. HPLC Analysis of Peptides—Five nanomoles of each synthetic peptide was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (SMART system equipped with a μRPC Sephasil C18 SC 2.1/10 column (GE Healthcare)). The eluents used were: A, 19.6% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; B, 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The gradient was 0–31.2% B in 18 min and 31.2–100% in 4 min, and the flow rate was 210 μl/min–1. Several runs were performed with each synthetic peptide, and their location inside the acetonitrile gradient was reproducible with a maximum error of one fraction (52 μl). Proteasome Assays—Isolation and purification of 20 S proteasomes from rabbit psoas muscle used were performed exactly as previously described (9Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The reaction conditions for proteasome were as published (10Kisselev A.F. Garcia-Calvo M. Overkleeft H.S. Peterson E. Pennington M.W. Ploegh H.L. Thornberry N.A. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35869-35877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed in a Reflex IV instrument (Brucker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) operating in the positive ion reflection mode. Twenty-five microliters of sample were dried, resuspended in 1 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in a 2:1 solution of water:acetonitrile, and mixed with 1 μl of saturated α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid matrix in the same solution. One microliter of the mixture was dried and subjected to analysis. Aliquots of total digestions were dried and dissolved in 10 μl of 0.5% acetic acid in water and sequenced by quadrupole ion trap micro-HPLC (Biobasic C18 column, 150 × 0.18 mm (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) electrospray MS/MS in a Deca XP LCQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron). The eluents used were: A, 0.5% acetic acid in water; B, 80% acetonitrile containing 0.5% acetic acid. The gradient was 0–40% B in 24 min and 40–100% in 5 min, and the flow rate was 1.5 μl/min–1. We used the MS/MS mode focused to each hypothetical parental peptide with a isolation width (m/z) of 1.5 Da. The charge and the mass of the ionic species were determined by high resolution sampling of the mass/charge rank. Collision energy and ion precursor resolution were improved to optimize the fragmentation spectrum. As a first step, proteasomes were isolated and purified (9Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Next, m19 synthetic peptide was incubated with purified proteasomes. After that, the cleavage products generated by this protease involved in m19 processing were analyzed by mass spectrometry. In a first approximation MALDI-MS analysis of total digestion was carried out. This system allowed the detection of three different peptidic species derived from the m19 sequence (Fig. 1). Species number 3 had identical m/z with the 1–14 peptide detected as the major cleavage product by Eggers et al. (5Eggers M. Boesfabian B. Ruppert T. Kloetzel P.M. Koszinowski U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To elucidate the nature of the two additional products detected and verify the nature of species number 3, MS/MS analysis was performed. To this end, micro-HPLC with on-line detection by ESI-IT MS/MS was performed. This strategy in addition to the identification of peptide by fragmentation also increases the resolution of peptide separation before detection and subsequently enhances the sensitivity of the assay. In this automated separation-detection system, four peptidic products were unequivocally identified: the three previously detected by MALDI mass spectrometry together with one new shorter peptide (Fig. 2, top). In addition, uncertainties on the nature of species numbers 1 and 2, inherent to previous MALDI analysis, were resolved. In summary, 1–14, 4–14, 5–14, and 6–14 peptides were identified as cleavage products. No peptides were detected that arose from cleavages within the 9pp89 core in both MALDI-TOF and ESI-IT analysis.FIGURE 2Digestion pattern of m19 synthetic peptide with purified proteasome analyzed by ESI-IT mass spectrometry. The sequence of the cytomegalovirus epitope is boxed. The lines show peptide products identified by MS analysis, and their respective name is indicated. The peptide products identified by micro-HPLC with on-line detection by ESI-IT MS/MS analysis were depicted above the m19 amino acid sequence. Similarly, the micro-HPLC-MS/MS data using analysis of the predefined parent ion were depicted below the m19 amino acid sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Usually the automated MS/MS scan mode allows for the identification of predominant parental peptidic species, but we are interested in the identification of the largest spectrum of products generated by the proteasome activity. The potential digestion products of m19 are closely related and the collection is highly complex. Indeed, in the mixture of digestion products of m19 peptide by the proteasome 35 theoretical different peptides are possible that contain the cytomegalovirus 6–14 nonamer core, that is that are immunologically relevant. As the m19 sequence presents two Met (easily oxidized) located at the N terminus and at residue number 10, all processed relevant peptides could appear also as the oxidized molecular ion. In addition, five of these peptides present the two Met residues in their sequence. In summary, we need to detect 42 distinct molecular ions that correspond to 80 relevant molecular species derived from the m19 sequence; some of them have the same hydrophobic properties and some have identical daughter ions produced by MS fragmentation. As the hypothetical cleavage products are overlapping peptides because they have an identical nonamer core and present staged length, their hydrophobic properties in reverse phase HPLC could be related. In addition, the two residues flanking the 9pp89 epitope are symmetrical, and thus, their corresponding peptides (A9pp89 and 9pp89A or GA9pp89 and 9pp89AG) present identical HPLC retention properties as well as m/z values. Previous HPLC separation analysis (data not shown) indicated a short separation of a maximum of 4 to 5 fractions between the two extreme peptides, m19 and 9pp89 epitope (6YPHFMPTNL14). This is true even when the gradient used for elution of the synthetic peptides from the reverse phase HPLC column was rather flat (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, several overlapping peptides could co-elute in the same HPLC fraction. A general limitation of the analysis of complex mixtures by MS is the inability to discriminate isomers because MS/MS data are often ambiguous when multiple components are fragmented simultaneously. This might explain the limited improvement obtained with HPLC-ESI-IT over MALDI-MS analysis. Thus, we studied each one of the 35 theoretical different peptides that contain the cytomegalovirus 6–14 nonamer core in successive micro-HPLC assays to explore all possible products of the proteasome activity. Because only ions of selected mass-to-charge ratio are monitored, their scan mode generally provides higher sensitivity than does the full scan mode. Thus, by using micro-LC-MS/MS with fixed precursor to analyze each theoretical doubly charged ion derived from m19 sequence and performing a continuous operation in MS/MS under standard fragmentation conditions, we can acquire more information on the studied biological process. Fig. 3 shows the interpretation of overlapping products derived from the m19 substrate. Five different molecular ions could be detected by MS/MS fragmentation of the doubly charged ion at m/z 810.9. This is the most complex indecisiveness that exists among all potential overlapping peptides derived from the m19 sequence. This m/z corresponds to five different 14-mers: the 6–19 peptide, both 2–16 and 3–17 peptides with their respective oxidized Met, and the 1–14 peptide with either Met-1 or Met-10 oxidized. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the mass spectrometer detects a molecular ion with this m/z range around minute 36 of the HPLC gradient compatible with the five molecular species cited above. The fragment spectrum obtained was manually interpreted, yielding two different sequences that satisfactorily matched the pattern of fragment ions. This analysis discards the presence of three of five candidates and as shown in Fig. 3 demonstrates the existence of both 1–14 peptides with either Met-1 or Met-10 oxidized. Fig. 2 (bottom) summarizes the results obtained with the micro-HPLC-MS/MS operating with the parental ion fixed for all isomeric peptide mixtures. The MS/MS fragmentation spectra were manually interpreted to identify all co-eluting overlapping peptides including those present in lower relative amounts. Some peptides such as 1–17 were found in all cleavage experiments including the negative control with only the m19 synthetic peptide without proteases and were not considered. These results agree with some reports (11Skribanek Z. Mezo G. Mak M. Hudecz F. J. Pept. Sci. 2002; 8: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that indicate that Asp-Pro bonds of synthetic peptides can undergo spontaneous cleavage under acid conditions such as those used in solubilization and purification of peptides prior to ESI-IT analysis. These data show a broad spectrum of processed peptides including the four previously defined (see above, Fig. 2) and demonstrate that the proteasome generates a collection of peptides where most peptides were N-extended and had the correct C-terminal Leu. Altogether we suggest the sequential cleavage model depicted in Fig. 4 as the major pathway followed by the proteasome. First, the proteasome would cut the m19 peptide between residues Gly-16 and Asp-17. In a second step, the two C-terminal residues (Ala-15 and Gly-16) of this product would be removed. Next, N-terminal Met and Asp residues would be cleaved. Afterward, the N terminus of this 3–19 product would continue to be trimmed residue by residue. This model accounts for three-fourths of the total amount of detected peptides. It has been proposed that the substrate interacts with the large inner surface of the proteasome core at undefined non-catalytic sites (12Kisselev A.F. Kaganovich D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, some authors suggest that the substrate can be covalently attached to one active site in a transition state complex and then be attacked in turn by other active sites (13Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Therefore, as the 1–14 peptide is the major cleavage product of m19 degradation (Fig. 1) and we detect mainly N-terminal step by step trimming, this model suggests that Leu-14 is fixed whereas adjacent catalytic sites remove sequentially these N-terminal residues. These N-extended peptides could be trimmed by aminopeptidases (2Saveanu L. Fruci D. van Endert P. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to cleavages inside the 9pp89 epitope, the different prediction algorithms for proteasome activity 3D. López, O. Calero, M. Jiménez, M. García-Calvo, and M. Del Val, unpublished data. predict the C-terminal cleavage but not the N-end trimming observed in our experiments. Alternatively, in each m19 molecule the proteasome may simultaneously perform two cleavages, one with relaxed specificity at the N terminus and the other one strongly focused on the preferred cleavage site after Leu-14. With three other additional products detected (4–15, 2–16, and 3–17 peptides) no obvious specificity patterns were found. The most simple explanation could be that some m19 molecules were cut with a relaxed specificity in the two cleavages that generates these individual peptides independently. In summary, our results show how the identification of highly related peptidic species in a highly selective and specific manner is possible and allow its application to elucidate the mechanisms of antigen processing.
