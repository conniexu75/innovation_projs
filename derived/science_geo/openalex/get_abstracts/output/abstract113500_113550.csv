https://openalex.org/W2002189290,"Spindle waves are a prototypical example of synchronized oscillations, a common feature of neuronal activity in thalamic and cortical systems in sleeping and waking animals. Spontaneous spindle waves recorded from slices of the ferret lateral geniculate nucleus were generated by rebound burst firing in relay cells. This rebound burst firing resulted from inhibitory postsynaptic potentials arriving from the perigeniculate nucleus, the cells of which were activated by burst firing in relay neurons. Reduction of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor-mediated inhibition markedly enhanced GABAB inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in relay cells and subsequently generated a slowed and rhythmic population activity resembling that which occurs during an absence seizure. Pharmacological block of GABAB receptors abolished this seizure-like activity but not normal spindle waves, suggesting that GABAB antagonists may be useful in the treatment of absence seizures."
https://openalex.org/W1549372716,"The recent cloning of three melanocortin receptors suggests an unexpected diversity in this family of seven transmembrane G-protein linked receptors. Herein, we report the cloning, expression, and gene localization of a fourth human melanocortin receptor, the melanocortin-4 receptor. By Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization, this receptor is expressed primarily in the brain, but its expression is notably absent in the adrenal cortex, melanocytes, and placenta. Agonist stimulation of COS-1 cells transiently transfected and L-cells permanently transfected with the coding region of the cloned melanocortin-4 receptor leads to increases in intracellular cyclic 3‘,5‘-adenosine monophosphate. The profile of the responses of the melanocortin-4 receptor to different melanocortins distinguishes it from melanocortin receptors previously described. Using the technique of fluorescent in situ hybridization, the gene encoding the melanocortin-4 receptor was localized to chromosome 18 (q21.3)."
https://openalex.org/W2039468514,"Tau protein, a component of Alzheimer paired helical filaments, can be phosphorylated by several kinases. Of particular interest is the phosphorylation at Ser/Thr-Pro motifs because the resulting state of tau is similar to that found in Alzheimer's disease, as judged by its immunoreactivity. This state can be mimicked by a brain extract kinase activity and by MAP kinase. We have now studied the effect of these modes of phosphorylation on the interaction between tau and microtubules. Although MAP kinase efficiently phosphorylates many Ser/Thr-Pro motifs of tau, its effect on microtubule binding is only moderate. By contrast, phosphorylation of a single residue, Ser262, has a major effect on binding. Ser262 is not phosphorylated by MAP kinase or other proline-directed kinases, but is phosphorylated by a 35/41 kd kinase in brain, whose purification is described."
https://openalex.org/W1581414531,"Ceramide activates a cytosolic protein phosphatase present in rat T9 glioma cells and rat brain. Ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (CAPP) was found to share several properties with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) leading to the hypothesis that ceramide may directly activate PP2A. PP2A was isolated as a heterotrimer (AB'C, AB alpha C), heterodimer (AC), or free C subunit, and the effect of ceramide on the catalytic activity was assessed. C2-ceramide, 5-20 microM, activated heterotrimeric PP2A up to 3.5-fold but had no effect on the activity of AC or C. Ceramides possessing hexanoyl, decanoyl, and myristoyl but not stearoyl acyl chains also activated heterotrimeric PP2A. Ceramide activation of heterotrimeric PP2A required the presence of a B subunit since trypsinization or heparin treatment abolished ceramide activation. Activation of heterotrimeric PP2A was specific for ceramide because related sphingolipids had no effect. Moreover, dihydro-C2-ceramide, which lacks the trans double bond in the sphingoid base, inhibited AB'C activity by > 90% at 10 microM. The specificity of activation of AB'C and AB alpha C by stereoisomers of C2-ceramide was found to differ. Whereas activation of AB'C by either DL-erythro- or threo-C2-ceramide was similar, AB alpha C was activated by either D- or L-erythro-C2-ceramide but not by the threo isomers. CAPP isolated from T9 cells was most effectively activated by D-erythro-C2-ceramide. CAPP was found to possess two peaks of ceramide activated phosphatase activity. The initial peak of activity was coincident with the elution of AB'C and was stimulated 1.8-fold by 20 microM C2-ceramide. A second peak of phosphatase activity was negligible in the absence of ceramide but was stimulated 5.5-fold by 20 microM C2-ceramide. These results support the hypothesis that ceramide is a specific lipid second messenger modulating heterotrimeric PP2A activity."
https://openalex.org/W2057234832,"A human gene encoding the c-myc purine-binding transcription factor PuF was identified by screening of a cervical carcinoma cell complementary DNA library with a DNA fragment containing PuF binding sites. The 17-kilodalton bacterially produced PuF was shown to have biological activity and properties similar to that of human PuF. DNA sequence analysis of recombinant PuF revealed perfect identity with the human nm23-H2 nucleoside diphosphate kinase gene, a potential negative regulator of cancer metastasis. These results provide a link between nm23 and the c-myc oncogene and suggest that the nm23 protein can function in vitro in the transcriptional regulation of c-myc expression."
https://openalex.org/W2026452617,Propagating Ca2+ waves are a characteristic feature of Ca2+-linked signal transduction pathways. Intracellular Ca2+ waves are formed by regenerative stimulation of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores by Ca2+ itself. Mechanisms that rely on either inositol trisphosphate or ryanodine receptor channels have been proposed to account for Ca2+ waves in various cell types. Both channel types contributed to the Ca2+ wave during fertilization of sea urchin eggs. Alternative mechanisms of Ca2+ release imply redundancy but may also allow for modulation and diversity in the generation of Ca2+ waves.
https://openalex.org/W2006265135,"Fertilization is accompanied by a transient increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+, which serves as a signal for initiating development. Some of the Ca2+ appears to be released from intracellular stores by the binding of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) to its receptor. However, in sea urchin eggs, other mechanisms appear to participate. Cyclic adenosine diphosphate--ribose (cADPR), a naturally occurring metabolite of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is as potent as IP3 in mobilizing Ca2+ in sea urchin eggs. Experiments with antagonists of the cADPR and IP3 receptors revealed that both Ca2+ mobilizing systems were activated during fertilization. Blockage of either of the systems alone was not sufficient to prevent the sperm-induced Ca2+ transient. This study provides direct evidence for a physiological role of cADPR in the Ca2+ signaling process."

https://openalex.org/W1597640694,"alpha 1-Adrenergic agonists induce a hypertrophic phenotype in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Quantifiable markers of this phenotype include stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, transcriptional induction of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene expression, and an increase in myocardial cell size. The aim of the present work was to determine which alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype mediates the acquisition of these parameters of myocardial cell hypertrophy. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis is inhibited by low concentrations of 5-methylurapidil (log Ki = -8.7) and (+)-niguldipine (log Ki = -10.6). The alpha-adrenergic receptor-induced increase in transcriptional activation of an ANF luciferase reporter gene is inhibited over the same range of concentrations of 5-methylurapidil (log Ki = -8.2) and (+)-niguldipine (log Ki = -11.2) that inhibit phosphoinositide hydrolysis. In addition, the increase in cell size that accompanies alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation of cultured ventricular myocytes is blocked by similar concentrations of 5-methylurapidil (log Ki = -8.0) and (+)-niguldipine (log Ki = -10.6). In contrast, treatment with the alpha 1B selective antagonist chlorethylclonidine at a concentration of 10 microM had no effect on the adrenergically mediated induction of ANF luciferase reporter gene expression or the adrenergically induced increase in myocardial cell size. These findings demonstrate that pharmacologically identifiable alpha 1A-adrenergic receptors mediate not only the early effects of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation such as phosphoinositide hydrolysis, but that they activate the signaling pathways that control transcriptional induction of the ANF luciferase reporter gene and an increase in myocardial cell size. Studies using alpha 1-adrenergic receptor cDNAs to delineate and alter the direct interaction of this receptor subtype with proximal signaling molecules, e.g. GTP binding proteins, should provide a powerful means of assessing their role in the induction of the molecular and morphologic parameters of myocardial cell hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2066398820,Expression of the myogenic helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein myogenin in muscle cell precursors within somites and limb buds is among the earliest events associated with myogenic lineage determination in vertebrates. Mutations in the myogenin promoter that abolish binding sites for myogenic HLH proteins or myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF-2) suppressed transcription of a linked lacZ transgene in subsets of myogenic precursors in mouse embryos. These results suggest that myogenic HLH proteins and MEF-2 participate in separable regulatory circuits leading to myogenin transcription and provide evidence for positional regulation of myogenic regulators in the embryo.
https://openalex.org/W2089543949,"Calcium channels play an important role in regulating various neuronal processes, including synaptic transmission and cellular plasticity. The N-type calcium channels, which are sensitive to omega-conotoxin, are involved in the control of transmitter release from neurons. A functional N-type calcium channel complex was purified from rabbit brain. The channel consists of a 230-kilodalton subunit (alpha 1B) that is tightly associated with a 160-kilodalton subunit (alpha 2 delta), a 57-kilodalton subunit (beta 3), and a 95-kilodalton glycoprotein subunit. The complex formed a functional calcium channel with the same pharmacological properties and conductance as those of the native omega-conotoxin-sensitive calcium channel in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2089315523,"Upon lytic infection of permissive cells, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) transactivator protein VP16 associates with an accessory protein termed host cell factor (HCF). Binding to HCF activates VP16 for association with the octamer motif-binding protein Oct-1, to form a multiprotein-DNA complex responsible for activating transcription of the HSV immediate early genes. We show that HCF comprises a series of related polypeptides that range from 110 to 300 kd, all of which are encoded by a single gene. Although there is no obvious sequence similarity between HCF and other known proteins, HCF contains eight repeats of a new 26 amino acid motif. cDNAs encoding HCF predict a large open reading frame of 2035 codons. When expressed in human cells, this large open reading frame encodes both the 300 kd and smaller HCF polypeptides, indicating that the smaller polypeptides arise by processing of the 300 kd protein."
https://openalex.org/W1993373202,"Using flash photolysis of caged Ca2+ and the membrane capacitance to monitor exocytosis, we have studied the response of single melanotrophs to a step rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Exocytosis begins with a rapid burst. This burst is followed by a slower phase, which is inhibited at cytosolic pH 6.2, and an ultraslow phase, which is strongly temperature sensitive. The exocytic burst starts with a delay of 6–11 ms and continues at a rate that grows steeply with [Ca2+]i and is half-maximal at [Ca2+]i = 27 μM. At least 3 Ca2+ ions are required to trigger exocytosis. The rate constant at saturating [Ca2+]i suggests that exocytosis of a dense core vesicle takes 40 ms after all Ca2+ ions have bound to their regulatory sites. If docked dense core vesicles cause the exocytic burst, they must decorate the plasma membrane at a mean density of 0.5/μm2."
https://openalex.org/W1511670599,"Red blood cells (RBC) and many other cell types exhibit increased rates of proteolysis during exposure to oxygen radicals and other activated oxygen species (oxidative stress). One of the major RBC proteins modified and proteolytically degraded during oxidative stress is hemoglobin (Hb). We now show that Hb undergoes a partial unfolding (or denaturation) during exposure to hydroxyl radicals (.OH), with an increase in hydrophobicity (hydrophobic interaction chromatography). At low .OH/Hb molar ratios, oxidatively modified Hb exhibits increased proteolytic susceptibility during incubation with RBC lysates, cell-free extracts, Fraction II, a 40-80% (NH4)2SO4 fraction, and purified proteasome (the 670-kDa RBC multicatalytic proteinase complex that we have previously called macroxyproteinase. At higher .OH/Hb molar ratios covalent cross-linking between Hb tetramers, and decreased proteolytic susceptibility are observed. The selective degradation of .OH-modified Hb is an ATP- and ubiquitin-independent process (in fact ATP is slightly inhibitory), and antibody precipitation studies, as well as inhibitor studies, indicate that proteasome is responsible for at least 60-70% of the activity in RBC. We propose that the mechanism of oxidation-induced proteolysis involves exposure of hydrophobic amino acid R groups during the partial Hb unfolding (or partial denaturation) that occurs at relatively low .OH/Hb molar ratios. Peptide bonds flanked by hydrophobic residues are preferred substrates for the proteasome complex, which degrades .OH-modified Hb in a processive process involving apparent serine-protease, sulfhydryl-protease, and metallo-peptidase activities. Highly denatured and covalently cross-linked Hb molecules, produced at high .OH/Hb molar ratios, are poorly degraded in RBC lysates and at all stages of proteasome purification. These cross-linked Hb tetramers have molecular sizes of 120-180 kDa and are presumably too large to fit in the proteasome active site(s). Recognition of exposed hydrophobic amino acid R groups provides a simple, energy-independent, and universal explanation for the proteasome-dependent proteolysis that accompanies oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2040105779,"In the cilia of amphibian olfactory receptor neurons, odorants elicit a receptor current that has two components: a cationic current through CAMP-gated channels and a Cl− current. Here, a cascade of ciliary currents that accounts for the total receptor current is demonstrated. In isolated olfactory cilia, cAMP sequentially activates two currents. The first is a primary cationic current through channels directly gated by CAMP. Part of this current is carried by Ca2+, which in turn activates a Cl− current. This secondary current is eliminated by the presence of CI− channel inhibitors, replacement of Cl− with methanesulfonate−, removal of external Ca2+, or blockers of the cAMP-gated cationic channels. When cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering is low, small cationic currents can activate Cl− currents that are 20 times larger."

https://openalex.org/W1594507882,"A human hepatoma (HepG2) cell line library was screened with an oligonucleotide probe for macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) to clone an MSP cDNA. Deduced sequences of isolated clones were compared with peptide fragment sequences of MSP. MSP9 cDNA encoded most of the known sequence of MSP except for a small segment of the 5' end of the open reading frame. Consequently, a hybrid 2300-base pair cDNA that encoded the complete MSP amino acid sequence was constructed from 2 clones. Culture fluid from COS-7 cells transfected with this full-length MSP cDNA had MSP biological activity, and the expressed MSP was detected by immunoprecipitation with antibody against native MSP. The deduced amino acid sequence of MSP includes 4 kringle domains, which have been found in hepatocyte growth factor and several proteins of the blood coagulation system. Among them, MSP has the highest sequence similarity to hepatocyte growth factor (45% identity). The MSP cDNA hybridized strongly to mRNA from liver, and to a lesser extent to mRNA from kidney and pancreas, suggesting that a cell type in the liver is the source of MSP. Several cloned and sequenced MSP cDNAs had insertions or deletions, suggesting that alternatively spliced MSP mRNAs may occur. This was reflected in Northern blots probed with an MSP cDNA, which showed more than one mRNA species. Furthermore, although the gene coding for MSP is on chromosome 3, the sequence of one of the cDNAs was identical with a unique sequence in chromosome 1, indicating that there may be a family of MSP genes, located on chromosomes 3 and 1."
https://openalex.org/W1503356528,"The trimeric form of protein phosphatase 2A consisting of 36-, 65-, and 72-kDa subunits (previously termed polycation-stimulated protein phosphatase M) was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle. Amino acid sequence data of the 72-kDa regulatory subunit (termed PR72) were used to isolate cDNAs from human heart and fetal brain libraries and libraries derived from WI-38 and MCF-7 cells. The clones isolated from the heart cDNA library revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kDa. All the peptides sequenced from the protein matched with the sequence predicted from the cDNA. However, in vitro transcription and translation from this cDNA yielded a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. From brain we isolated cDNA clones spanning an open reading frame encoding a 130-kDa protein (termed PR130). The apparent molecular mass of the protein produced by in vitro transcription and translation was 130 kDa. This protein has exactly the same deduced C-terminal protein sequence as the PR72 subunit from amino acids 45 to 527 but has an N-terminal extension of 665 amino acids. It is likely, therefore, that these two proteins arise from the same gene by alternative splicing. In human tissues several transcripts were detected by Northern analysis generated probably by the use of different polyadenylation signals and alternative splicing. High levels of the PR72 mRNAs were detected in heart and muscle, while lower levels of PR130 transcripts were found in heart, brain, placenta, lung, muscle, and kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1507370496,"We have purified a high molecular weight complex (RC-1) from calf thymus nuclei that catalyzes a recombinational repair of double-strand gaps and deletions in DNA by gene conversion as well as cross-over events leading to cointegrant products. These have been detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis using oligonucleotide primer pairs that detect joined sequences originally present on only one or the other of the recombination substrates. RC-1 has an apparent molecular mass of about 550-600 kDa and contains at least five polypeptide chains: molecular masses about 230, 210, 160, 130, and 40 kDa. RC-1 contains a DNA polymerase, identified as DNA polymerase epsilon, that co-purifies with RC-1. A DNA ligase, most likely mammalian DNA ligase III, and a 5'-3' exonuclease also copurify with the RC-1. Most preparations of RC-1 contain low levels of a double-strand endonuclease, 3'-5' exonuclease and single-strand nuclease activities. However, DNA helicase, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, or DNA topoisomerase I and II were not detected in RC-1. The DNA polymerase and DNA ligase in RC-1 can act in concert to repair a multiply gapped DNA to a covalently repaired duplex. The bovine single-strand-binding protein stimulates the formation of the recombination products and the repair reaction mentioned above about 4-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1523490315,"The thermoisomerization of previtamin D3 to vitamin D3 is the last step in the synthesis of vitamin D3 in human skin. Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of this reaction in human skin and an organic solvent revealed that not only the equilibrium of the reaction was shifted in favor of vitamin D3 formation in human skin (equilibrium constant K at 37 degrees C = 11.44) compared to hexane (K = 6.15), but also the rate of the reaction was increased by more than 10-fold in human skin (T1/2 at 37 degrees C = 2.5 h) when compared to hexane (T1/2 = 30 30 h). This extraordinarily fast reaction rate was also confirmed in vitro in chicken skin and in vivo in human subjects. The enthalpy change for the reaction determined by the van't Hoff plot was delta H degree = -21.58 kJ mol-1 in human skin and delta H degree = -15.60 kJ mol-1 in hexane. Arrhenius plots showed that the activation energies for both the forward and the reverse reactions were lower in human skin (Ea1 = 71.05 kJ mol-1 and Ea2 = 92.63 kJ mol-1) than in hexane (Ea1 = 84.90 kJ mol-1 and Ea2 = 100.5 kJ mol-1). Activation parameters for the reaction in human skin and in hexane were also reported. Subcellular fractionation of human epidermal tissue revealed that most epidermal 7-dehydrocholesterol and previtamin D3 were in the membrane fraction, while only 20% were in the cytosol. The interaction of previtamin D3 with intracellular lipids and/or proteins in skin may be responsible for the increased vitamin D3 formation rate in the skin."
https://openalex.org/W1581213467,"We have reported previously that the human vitamin D receptor (hVDR) is selectively phosphorylated by protein kinase C-beta (PKC-beta), in vitro, on a serine residue in the sequence RRS51MKRK, which is located between the two zinc fingers of hVDR and is potentially important to its transacting function (Hsieh, J.-C., Jurutka, P.W., Galligan, M.A., Terpening, C.M., Haussler, C.A., Samuels, D.S., Shimizu, Y., Shimizu, N., and Haussler, M.R. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 9315-9319). In the present experiments we evaluated this phosphorylation event using a series of hVDR mutants in which serine 51 or its flanking residues were modified. Alteration of serine 51 to a non-phosphorylatable residue resulted in an approximately 60% reduction in basal hVDR phosphorylation in intact cells but did not diminish 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-stimulated phosphorylation. Such mutations also abolished subsequent phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated hVDR by purified PKC-beta, in vitro, as did replacement of basic residues on either side of serine 51. Mutation of serine 51 to glycine (S51G) or to aspartic acid (S51D), as well as altering the basic residues flanking serine 51, abolished the interaction of hVDR with the vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE) as monitored by gel mobility shift analysis. Thus, we conclude that unmodified serine 51 and its surrounding basic residues are crucial not only for PKC-beta substrate recognition but also for the optimal VDRE binding of native hVDR. In transactivation assays, S51G and S51D possessed only 35 and 10% of wild-type hVDR activity, respectively. Mutation of serine 51 to threonine (S51T) restored phosphorylation by PKC-beta, in vitro, to about 40% of wild-type and transactivation to 45% of that of wild-type hVDR. Alteration of serine 51 to alanine, which is the residue in the corresponding position of the glucocorticoid, progesterone, mineral-ocorticoid, and androgen receptors, eliminated PKC-beta phosphorylation but completely preserved the specific DNA binding activity and transactivation capacity of hVDR. Thus, phosphorylation of hVDR at serine 51 is not required for either VDRE binding or transactivation. Finally, incubation of Escherichia coli-expressed hVDR with PKC-beta elicits marked phosphorylation of the receptor and significantly inhibits its ability to complex with the VDRE. We therefore speculate that posttranslational modification of hVDR at serine 51 may constitute a negative regulatory loop which could be operative when target cells are subject to PKC activation events."

https://openalex.org/W1526356963,"Relaxin is a polypeptide hormone best known for its role in parturition. However, high affinity relaxin receptors have been localized in the rat brain and heart in addition to the uterus. Several lines of evidence also suggest that relaxin may be involved in the regulation of blood pressure, heart rate, and the release of oxytocin and vasopressin. We now show by Northern analysis that a 1-kilobase relaxin transcript is detected in the rat brain as well as the ovary of pregnant rats. Using in situ hybridization, relaxin mRNA is localized in discrete regions of the male and female brains, including the anterior olfactory nucleus, tenia tecta, pyriform cortex, neocortex, and hippocampus. Developmental studies show that relaxin mRNA is present in the 1-day postnatal brain, while relaxin receptors are not detectable until 7 days after birth. The relaxin receptor binding affinity was similar in the developing brains, but there was a steady increase in relaxin binding sites during postnatal days 7 to 29, suggesting that relaxin may play a role in brain maturation. While relaxin mRNA is not detected in the heart, high levels of relaxin receptors are detected in the cardiac atrium as early as 1 day after birth. These atrial receptors remained at similar levels throughout postnatal development, suggesting an important role for relaxin in cardiovascular function."
https://openalex.org/W2045885631,"Transfer RNA (tRNA) splicing is essential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as in humans, and many of its features are the same in both. In yeast, the final step of this process is removal of the 2' phosphate generated at the splice junction during ligation. A nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent phosphotransferase catalyzes removal of the 2' phosphate and produces a small molecule. It is shown here that this small molecule is an NAD derivative: adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose 1""-2"" cyclic phosphate. Evidence is also presented that this molecule is produced in Xenopus laevis oocytes as a result of dephosphorylation of ligated tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1575598349,"We have modeled the reactions involved in the completion of lagging strand DNA replication using a synthetic DNA substrate and purified enzymes from calf thymus. We have demonstrated that each polymerase, alpha, delta, and epsilon, is capable of extending an upstream 3' terminus to generate a nick in the DNA substrate that is subsequently ligated by DNA ligase I. Synthesis by each polymerase and subsequent ligation occurred efficiently after the addition of the 50-kDa 5'- to 3'-exonuclease. Analyses are presented which show that a substantial proportion of the ligated products is the result of polymerase epsilon, exonuclease, and DNA ligase I, all acting on the same DNA template. That is, polymerase fills in the gap, then both the polymerase and exonuclease act, one adding and the other removing nucleotides, followed by ligation. Results presented suggest that polymerase alpha, delta, or epsilon may functionally interact with DNA ligase I and the 5'- to 3'-exonuclease to perform the enzymatic reactions required for the completion of lagging strand DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1493457438,"The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta-ARK) specifically phosphorylates the activated form of various G protein-coupled receptors such as the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2-AR). Recently, G protein beta gamma subunits have been demonstrated to activate beta-ARK-mediated receptor phosphorylation. To further elucidate beta-ARK/G protein interactions, we have developed a direct binding assay. The direct binding of [35S]methionine-labeled beta-ARK to either brain Gi/Go or beta gamma subunits was rapid and saturable with similar Kd values of approximately 58 and approximately 32 nM, respectively. Both heterotrimeric G proteins and beta gamma subunits enhanced the initial rate of beta 2-AR and rhodopsin phosphorylation approximately 10-fold. Kinetic studies demonstrate that beta gamma enhances beta-ARK-mediated beta 2-AR phosphorylation both by decreasing the Km for the beta 2-AR approximately 4-fold and increasing the stoichiometry of phosphorylation from approximately 4 to approximately 11 mol/mol. An agonist- and ATP-dependent binding of beta-ARK to the reconstituted beta 2-AR was also demonstrated. In addition, beta-ARK binding was enhanced in the presence of both the activated beta 2-AR and beta gamma subunits suggesting the formation of a transient ternary complex consisting of beta-ARK, beta gamma, and beta 2-AR. Overall, these studies suggest that the specific association of beta-ARK with heterotrimeric G proteins may play an important role in promoting receptor/kinase interaction and subsequent receptor phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1576237222,"We have developed model systems in which the binding of purified, genetically engineered, soluble analogues of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules to immobilized antigenic peptides can be monitored in real time using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Synthetic analogues of several peptides known to bind different mouse and human MHC class I molecules were prepared with cysteine residues substituted at appropriate positions. The analogue peptides were immobilized via the bifunctional reagent N-gamma-maleimidobutyryloxy-succinimide to amino groups generated on the dextran-modified gold surface of a biosensor flow cell. Using this approach, each position in the sequence of an H-2Ld-specific viral peptide, pMCMV (YPHFMPTNL), was used for coupling, and the resulting surfaces were tested for binding of the soluble analogue of H-2Ld, H-2Lds. In accord with our previously described H-2Ld/pMCMV three-dimensional structural model, only those residues of the peptide that remain exposed following binding (positions 4-8) can be replaced by cysteine and used for coupling. Stable binding of soluble MHC class I molecules, H-2Lds, H-2Dds, H-2Kbs, and HLA-A2s to their respective immobilized cognate peptides was detected by SPR. Specificity of the peptide/MHC interaction was characterized both by direct binding using immobilized peptides and by competition with peptides in solution, and in general was consistent with known immunological reactivity. Some peptides bound not only their cognate MHC molecule, but others at lower apparent affinity. Measurement of real time binding of MHC class I molecules to peptides immobilized through specific side chains suggests the application of a similar approach to the study of the interaction of peptides with a wide variety of peptide-binding macromolecules."

https://openalex.org/W1594825631,"The effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the activation of junB in a mouse macrophage cell line (J774) was investigated. J774 cells responded to either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or LPS by the transient increase in the expression levels of c-jun and junB mRNA, but not of junD mRNA. The prior depletion of protein kinase C from J774 cells blocked the action of PMA, but not of LPS, to activate junB. Pretreatment of cells with H-89 or H-7, but not with HA1004, W-7, ML-7, or tyrphostin 47, inhibited LPS-triggered junB activation. Treatment with forskolin also activated junB of J774 cells through an H-89- or H-7-sensitive pathway. Since cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity of J774 cells was inhibited by H-89, but not by H-7, LPS appears to activate junB through a cascade involving two steps, the one sensitive to H-89 and the other to H-7. Western blot analysis showed that LPS-triggered junB activation is accompanied by the increased expression of JunB proteins in the cell lysate as well as in the nuclear extract. JunB in nuclear fraction appears to specifically bind to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-response element (TRE), since preincubation of nuclear extracts with anti-JunB serum reduced the amount of TRE-binding proteins and since the amount of JunB, but not of c-Jun or JunD, immunoprecipitated from TRE-cross-linked nuclear proteins increased in response to LPS. Thus, JunB may play an important role in LPS-triggered gene activation."

While okadaic acid alone was a potent stimulator of glucose transport in both systems, it prevented transport stimulation by insulin. To gain insight into this inhibitory action, the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), one of the earliest postreceptor steps identified so far, was studied. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes and muscle, insulin increased PI3-kinase activity in immunoprecipitates obtained with antibodies to phosphotyrosine. Okadaic acid alone had no effect but strongly inhibited this hormonal action. Okadaic acid treatment did not interfere with insulin-induced receptor autophosphorylation or with its tyrosine kinase activity toward artificial substrates. In contrast, in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor, we did not observe tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor cellular substrate p185 (IRS-1) or immunoprecipitation of PI3-kinase by antibodies to phosphotyrosine. These results suggest that okadaic acid interferes with insulin's stimulation of glucose transport by inhibiting IRS-1 phosphorylation and its association with PI3-kinase and/or other signaling molecules. However, okadaic acid did not block the insulin stimulation of aminoisobutyric acid uptake in muscle. This would indicate that IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI3-kinase activation are not required for all the effects of insulin and that the serine/threonine phosphorylation events implicated in the translocation of glucose transporters are not controlling amino acid transport in muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2078761697,"Extracellular application of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes activated a saturating inward current with a maximal amplitude E(max) of 2.4 +/- 0.2 microamperes and an apparent Michaelis constant of 197.6 micromolar. The current was carried predominantly by sodium ions and potently inhibited by amiloride, guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and its nonhydrolyzable analogs guanosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate (GppNHp) and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Likewise, in vitro fertilization using mature eggs and Xenopus sperm was inhibited by amiloride, GTP, and GppNHp. Hence, an ATP receptor on the egg membrane may be the recipient target for ATP originating in sperm, suggesting that an ATP-induced increase in sodium permeability mediates the initial sperm to egg signal in the fertilization process."
https://openalex.org/W1534477640,"This report describes the immunological identification of a 60-kDa calmodulin-binding protein, previously detected in the nuclei of rat liver cells (Bachs, O., Lanini, L., Serratosa, J., Coll, M.J., Bastos, R., Aligue, R., Rius, E., and Carafoli, E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18595-18600), as the calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin could be extracted from the nuclei by incubation with DNase and RNase, indicating that it is associated with nuclear structures sensitive to the action of nucleases (chromatin or/and ribonucleoproteins). The presence of calcineurin in the nuclei of rat liver cells indicates that calmodulin may modulate the phosphorylation level of nuclear proteins by promoting their dephosphorylation. This report also shows that calmodulin inhibits the activity of casein kinase-2 in the nuclear fractions obtained by nuclease extraction. Phosphorylation experiments indicate that casein kinase-2 phosphorylates three major substrates of 100, 42-44, and 37 kDa as well as other minor proteins in the nuclease extracts. Calmodulin reduces the phosphorylation level of the two latter major proteins and of a minor band of 50 kDa. Thus, nuclear calmodulin in rat liver cells could regulate phosphorylation of nuclear proteins by at least two mechanisms: 1) activation of calcineurin and 2) inhibition of casein kinase-2."
https://openalex.org/W1538852141,"Developmental stage- and tissue-specific expression of the rat growth hormone (rGH) gene is conferred by DNA sequences within 237 base pairs of the transcription start site. Although binding of a number of transcription factors including Pit-1, Sp1, GHF3, and thyroid hormone receptor (T3R) stimulates rGH expression, several studies have suggested that interactions between these factors are important in determining cell specificity and responsiveness to extracellular signals. We have directly tested this hypothesis by creating a set of nested insertional mutations at two positions in the rGH promoter. Sequences were inserted at either position -148, separating GHF-3 and T3R binding sites from the downstream Pit-1 and Sp 1 binding sites, or at -51, separating the above elements from the TATA box. All insertions were made in the context of the rGH gene -237/+8 5'-flanking DNA, linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and tested for activity by transient transfection in GC pituitary tumor cells. Insertions at both -148 and -51 caused sharp distance-dependent reductions in serum-stimulated expression such that insertions of 23 base pairs at -51 or 44 base pairs at -148 were sufficient to isolate the effects of sequences upstream of the insertion point. Insertions at -148 reduced T3 responsiveness severalfold but had little or no effect on stimulation by forskolin, whereas insertions at -51 reduced both T3 and forskolin responsiveness. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that expression and regulation of the rGH gene is dependent on short-range protein-protein interactions, which are more critically dependent on spacing than the relative orientation of the transcription factor binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1568764751,"In the population of primary cultured rat chromaffin cells, over half exhibited spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations, whereas most others were induced to oscillate by low concentrations of bradykinin or KCl. [Ca2+]i spots were observed to pulsate in a defined cytoplasmic area (the oscillator). In silent cells those spots remained discrete, whereas in oscillating cells the [Ca2+]i increase expanded to occupy the entire cytoplasm. Alternation of these discrete and expanded events was observed in a few irregularly oscillating cells. Thapsigargin induced prompt blockade of both pulsations and oscillations and prevented recruitment of silent cells to oscillate. This indicates sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase-type Ca2+ pump(s) to be crucial for the functioning of the oscillator. Effects of other treatments were variable, depending on the concomitant [Ca2+]i changes. Oscillations were blocked when EGTA or nitrendipine decreased Ca2+ influx and thus [Ca2+]i; they were also blocked when [Ca2+]i was markedly increased by excess KCl, bradykinin, or ryanodine. When in contrast the [Ca2+]i increases induced by the latter agents remained moderate, oscillations were stimulated. The rhythmic activity of rat chromaffin cells appears, therefore, to operate under a complex regulation that requires [Ca2+]i within an appropriate operative range and does not involve directly the ryanodine receptor but might rely on the activation of IP3 receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1584803533,"Activation of protein C by thrombin is stimulated by the endothelial cell cofactor thrombomodulin. The structural regions of thrombomodulin necessary for cofactor activity have been localized to the fourth through sixth epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. The fourth EGF-like domain is unnecessary for high affinity thrombin binding, but is required for cofactor activity. To identify essential sequences within the fourth EGF-like domain, a series of recombinant human thrombomodulins consisting of EGF-like domains four through six were expressed in human kidney cells. These mutants contain replacements of disulfide loops within the fourth EGF-like domain, thereby conserving overall disulfide bond structure. All of the mutants bound to thrombin with high affinity, and inhibited the fibrinogen-clotting activity of thrombin to a similar extent. Two regions of the fourth EGF-like domain were identified to be essential for cofactor activity: 1) the sequence consisting of amino acids Glu-357, Tyr-358, and Gln-359 shared by the overlapping first and second disulfide loops, and 2) the amino-terminal region of the third disulfide loop containing amino acids Glu-374, Gly-375, and Phe-376. These results suggest that amino acids critical for thrombomodulin cofactor activity are located near the junction between the two subdomains of the fourth EGF-like domain."

https://openalex.org/W1515296758,"Annexin XI (CAP-50) is a probable target protein of calcyclin. Being different from other annexins, annexin XI localizes mainly in nuclei of cultured fibroblasts. In rat embryonic fibroblasts transformed by Rous sarcoma virus oncogene, SR-3Y1 cells, phosphorylation of annexin XI was increased on both serine and threonine residues (Ser > Thr) in vitro. Comparative phosphopeptide mappings analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography suggested that the sites phosphorylated in situ in SR-3Y1 cells are distinct from the sites by MAP kinase. Annexin XI phosphorylated by MAP kinase still possessed the ability to bind to phosphatidylserine vesicle. These results suggest that annexin XI is a substrate for some Ser/Thr kinase(s) which is activated in v-src-transformed cells and that the phosphorylation may regulate the function of annexin XI in living cells."

https://openalex.org/W1735368814,"Sequence alignment and modeling of the 2-kinase domain of the liver bifunctional enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase, on 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus and Escherichia coli (Bazan, J. F., Fletterick, R. J., and Pilkis, S. J. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 9642-9646) suggested that Cys-160 of the 2-kinase would correspond to Asp-127 of the 1-kinase, which acts as a general base catalyst. We have studied the validity of this alignment by site-directed mutagenesis of residues in the 2-kinase domain of skeletal muscle 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. Cys-160 was mutated to Asp or Ser. Two adjacent residues, Glu-157 and Asp-162, either of which could act as a general base catalyst, were mutated to Ala. Asp-162 corresponds to Asp-129 in the bacterial 1-kinase, which is also essential for catalysis and might bind Mg2+. None of these mutations significantly decreased the Vmax of the 2-kinase, suggesting that the mutated amino acids are not essential for catalysis and therefore do not play the same role as Asp-127 and Asp-129 in the bacterial 1-kinase. Mutation of Glu-157 and Asp-162 to alanine had no effect on the kinetic parameters of the bifunctional enzyme, indicating that these two negatively charged residues are not involved in catalysis and substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1504356452,"Two myelin basic protein kinases designated MBPK-1 and MBPK-2 were purified to apparent homogeneity from extracts of bovine kidney cortex. The purified preparations exhibited an apparent M(r) approximately 40,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and approximately 42,000 (MBPK-1) and 45,000 (MBPK-2) by gel permeation chromatography. Up to 0.4 and 1.8 mol of phosphoryl groups were incorporated per mol of MBPK-1 and MBPK-2, respectively, on threonines following incubation with ATP. Autophosphorylation, incubation with protein phosphatase 2A2 (PP2A2), CD45, or T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase did not affect MBPK-1 activity. Autophosphorylation increased by about 3-fold MBPK-2 activity. This autophosphorylation and activation was reversed by PP2A2 but not by CD45 or T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase. MBPK-1 and MBPK-2 displayed a positive reaction with an antibody to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Purified preparations of protamine kinase were activated by about 1.5-6-fold and, after inactivation with PP2A2, were reactivated by about 30% by MBPK-1 and MBPK-2. Activation and reactivation correlated with the incorporation, respectively, of 0.1-0.5 and 0.5 mol of phosphoryl groups/mol of the protamine kinase on serines. The results show that MBPK-1 and MBPK-2 are protamine kinase-activating kinases and suggest that MBPK-1 and MBPK-2 may be related to mitogen-activated protein kinase."
