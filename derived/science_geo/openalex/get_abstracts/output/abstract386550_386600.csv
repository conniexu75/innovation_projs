https://openalex.org/W2147311167,"Obesity is globally prevalent and highly heritable, but its underlying genetic factors remain largely elusive. To identify genetic loci for obesity susceptibility, we examined associations between body mass index and ∼ 2.8 million SNPs in up to 123,865 individuals with targeted follow up of 42 SNPs in up to 125,931 additional individuals. We confirmed 14 known obesity susceptibility loci and identified 18 new loci associated with body mass index (P < 5 × 10⁻⁸), one of which includes a copy number variant near GPRC5B. Some loci (at MC4R, POMC, SH2B1 and BDNF) map near key hypothalamic regulators of energy balance, and one of these loci is near GIPR, an incretin receptor. Furthermore, genes in other newly associated loci may provide new insights into human body weight regulation."

However, the porous electrodes cause poor performance in filter circuits that eliminate residual alternating current ripple from rectified direct current. Miller et al. (p. 1637 ) fabricated electrodes with a high surface area for ionic adsorption by growing graphene sheets in the vertical direction off a metal surface. Such capacitors may be able to perform the same filtering tasks as conventional capacitors but take up less space."

(p. 74 ) examined the partial oxidation of ethanol and glycerol to acids in alkaline aqueous solvents over gold and platinum catalysts. Conversions were highest for gold supported on titania, but studies with isotopically labeled molecular oxygen showed that oxygen incorporated into the acid comes from hydroxide ions. Direct incorporation of oxygen did not occur even for the platinum catalysts, despite the fact that oxygen can dissociate on this metal. Instead, molecular oxygen appeared to regenerate hydroxide ions at the metal surface through the formation of peroxide intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2150806217,"Cecilia Lindgren and colleagues report results of a large-scale genome-wide association study for waist-to-hip ratio, a measure of body fat distribution. They identify 13 new loci associated with this trait, several of which show stronger effects in women than in men. Waist-hip ratio (WHR) is a measure of body fat distribution and a predictor of metabolic consequences independent of overall adiposity. WHR is heritable, but few genetic variants influencing this trait have been identified. We conducted a meta-analysis of 32 genome-wide association studies for WHR adjusted for body mass index (comprising up to 77,167 participants), following up 16 loci in an additional 29 studies (comprising up to 113,636 subjects). We identified 13 new loci in or near RSPO3, VEGFA, TBX15-WARS2, NFE2L3, GRB14, DNM3-PIGC, ITPR2-SSPN, LY86, HOXC13, ADAMTS9, ZNRF3-KREMEN1, NISCH-STAB1 and CPEB4 (P = 1.9 × 10−9 to P = 1.8 × 10−40) and the known signal at LYPLAL1. Seven of these loci exhibited marked sexual dimorphism, all with a stronger effect on WHR in women than men (P for sex difference = 1.9 × 10−3 to P = 1.2 × 10−13). These findings provide evidence for multiple loci that modulate body fat distribution independent of overall adiposity and reveal strong gene-by-sex interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2066801946,"The dynamic behaviour of myosin V molecules translocating along actin filaments has been mainly studied by optical microscopy. The processive hand-over-hand movement coupled with hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate was thereby demonstrated. However, the protein molecules themselves are invisible in the observations and have therefore been visualized by electron microscopy in the stationary states. The concomitant assessment of structure and dynamics has been unfeasible, a situation prevailing throughout biological research. Here we directly visualize myosin V molecules walking along actin tracks, using high-speed atomic force microscopy. The high-resolution movies not only provide corroborative 'visual evidence' for previously speculated or demonstrated molecular behaviours, including lever-arm swing, but also reveal more detailed behaviours of the molecules, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the motor mechanism. Our direct and dynamic high-resolution visualization is a powerful new approach to studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules in action."

Catalysts that operate at lower temperatures will be useful in fuel cells. Nanoparticles of platinum adsorbed on reducible oxides, such as ceria, can stabilize catalytically active Ptoxygen species. Zhai et al.

https://openalex.org/W2034430001,"Tissue maintenance and homeostasis can be achieved through the replacement of dying cells by differentiating precursors or self-renewal of terminally differentiated cells or relies heavily on cellular longevity in poorly regenerating tissues. Regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells) represent an actively dividing cell population with critical function in suppression of lethal immune-mediated inflammation. The plasticity of T(reg) cells has been actively debated because it could factor importantly in protective immunity or autoimmunity. By using inducible labeling and tracking of T(reg) cell fate in vivo, or transfers of highly purified T(reg) cells, we have demonstrated notable stability of this cell population under physiologic and inflammatory conditions. Our results suggest that self-renewal of mature T(reg) cells serves as a major mechanism of maintenance of the T(reg) cell lineage in adult mice."
https://openalex.org/W2009958141,"Relativity Comes Down to Earth Over a century ago, Einstein presented the theory of relativity—where space and time are no longer fixed concepts, but are relative to an observer and their frame of reference. Tests of relativity have usually been confined to space-based measurements and/or with objects with velocities approaching the speed of light. Time-dilation and length-contraction have been confirmed and are used in satellite communication and global positioning systems. Using the precision of state-of-the-art optical clocks, Chou et al. (p. 1630 ) have confirmed that relativistic effects can now be measured at speeds attained by 100 meters sprinters (10 m/s) and gravitational effects due to just one meter height difference."

The genetics and reproductive fitness traits of different panther populations and their crosses reveal the benefits of outcrossing on survival, genetic diversity, male reproductive characteristics, and population demography."
https://openalex.org/W2122657809,"Closing the Vector Circle The genome sequence of Culex quinquefasciatus offers a representative of the third major genus of mosquito disease vectors for comparative analysis. In a major international effort, Arensburger et al. (p. 86 ) uncovered divergences in the C. quinquefasciatus genome compared with the representatives of the other two genera Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae . The main difference noted is the expansion of numbers of genes, particularly for immunity, oxidoreductive functions, and digestive enzymes, which may reflect specific aspects of the Culex life cycle. Bartholomay et al. (p. 88 ) explored infection-response genes in Culex in more depth and uncovered 500 immune response-related genes, similar to the numbers seen in Aedes , but fewer than seen in Anopheles or the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster . The higher numbers of genes were attributed partly to expansions in those encoding serpins, C-type lectins, and fibrinogen-related proteins, consistent with greater immune surveillance and associated signaling needed to monitor the dangers of breeding in polluted, urbanized environments. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that inoculation with unfamiliar bacteria prompted strong immune responses in Culex . The worm and virus pathogens that the mosquitoes transmit naturally provoked little immune activation, however, suggesting that tolerance has evolved to any damage caused by replication of the pathogens in the insects."

When cell surface receptors are stimulated and cause release of calcium from internal stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), STIM proteins in the ER membrane interact with the Orai channel pore protein in the plasma membrane to allow calcium entry from the outside of the cell (see the Perspective by Cahalan ). Park et al. (p. 101 ) and Wang et al. (p. 105 ) now show that STIM also acts to suppress conductance by another calcium channel—the voltage-operated Ca V 1.2 channel. STIM1 appeared to interact directly with Ca V 1.2 channels in multiple cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, neurons, and cultured cells derived from T lymphocytes. The interaction inhibited opening of the Ca V 1.2 channels and caused depletion of the channel from the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1993644779,"To understand a neural circuit requires knowledge of its connectivity. Here we report measurements of functional connectivity between the input and ouput layers of the macaque retina at single-cell resolution and the implications of these for colour vision. Multi-electrode technology was used to record simultaneously from complete populations of the retinal ganglion cell types (midget, parasol and small bistratified) that transmit high-resolution visual signals to the brain. Fine-grained visual stimulation was used to identify the location, type and strength of the functional input of each cone photoreceptor to each ganglion cell. The populations of ON and OFF midget and parasol cells each sampled the complete population of long- and middle-wavelength-sensitive cones. However, only OFF midget cells frequently received strong input from short-wavelength-sensitive cones. ON and OFF midget cells showed a small non-random tendency to selectively sample from either long- or middle-wavelength-sensitive cones to a degree not explained by clumping in the cone mosaic. These measurements reveal computations in a neural circuit at the elementary resolution of individual neurons. Colour vision arises in the retina, and in primates the first stage of processing consists of overlapping lattices of cone cells and ganglion cells, each of which samples visual space uniformly. Colour perception arises from the comparison of signals from different cone types, but how these inputs are combined by the ganglion cells, which transmit the output of the retina, has been an issue of contention over the years. Using large-scale multi-electrode arrays and fine-grained visual stimulation, Field et al. have now mapped out the location and type of single-cone inputs to entire populations of ganglion cells, resulting in input–output maps at an unprecedented resolution and scale.

https://openalex.org/W2037533749,"In a Spin The relaxation dynamics of electron spins in solid-state systems is of crucial importance for their usage in quantum computation and information storage. The interaction of the spin with its local environment results in lifetimes in the pico- to microsecond range. Thus, high temporal and spatial resolutions are needed to measure the relaxation time with atomic precision. Loth et al. (p. 1628 , see the cover; see the Perspective by Morgenstern ) used a scanning tunneling microscope with a spin-polarized tip to monitor the electron spin relaxation times of individual atoms adsorbed on a surface. A spin was excited by a pump signal, and its state read out after a variable time delay with a weak probe pulse that produced a spin-sensitive tunneling current. This general technique may be applicable to other systems with fast dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2079599967,"Infectious hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles assemble near lipid droplets in infected cells. Herker et al. now report that diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1) is required for this process and show that inhibiting DGAT1 reduces HCV infectivity in vitro. Targeting DGAT1 might offer a new strategy for the control of HCV infection. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is closely tied to the lipid metabolism of liver cells. Here we identify the triglyceride-synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1) as a key host factor for HCV infection. DGAT1 interacts with the viral nucleocapsid core and is required for the trafficking of core to lipid droplets. Inhibition of DGAT1 activity or RNAi-mediated knockdown of DGAT1 severely impairs infectious virion production, implicating DGAT1 as a new target for antiviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2015607265,"The maintenance of a progenitor cell population as a reservoir of undifferentiated cells is required for organ development and regeneration. However, the mechanisms by which epithelial progenitor cells are maintained during organogenesis are poorly understood. We report that removal of the parasympathetic ganglion in mouse explant organ culture decreased the number and morphogenesis of keratin 5-positive epithelial progenitor cells. These effects were rescued with an acetylcholine analog. We demonstrate that acetylcholine signaling, via the muscarinic M1 receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor, increased epithelial morphogenesis and proliferation of the keratin 5-positive progenitor cells. Parasympathetic innervation maintained the epithelial progenitor cell population in an undifferentiated state, which was required for organogenesis. This mechanism for epithelial progenitor cell maintenance may be targeted for organ repair or regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2154623127,"Auroral Chorus Energetic particles that arrive from near-Earth space produce photon emissions—the aurora—as they bombard the atmosphere in the polar regions. The pulsating aurora, which is characterized by temporal intensity variations, is thought to be caused by modulations in electron precipitation possibly produced by resonance with electromagnetic waves in Earth's magnetosphere. Nishimura et al. (p. 81 ) present a detailed study of an event that showed a good correlation between the temporal changes in auroral luminosity and chorus emission—a type of electromagnetic wave occurring in Earth's magnetosphere. The results points to chorus waves as the driver of the pulsating aurora."
https://openalex.org/W2085704648,"Current understanding suggests that radiative forcings over the course of an 11-year solar cycle are in phase with related influences on climate. Recent satellite data have revealed, however, that there seems to be a surprising spectral component to solar variability, at least in the declining phase of the current solar cycle: UV radiation decreases strongly while visible radiation increases. Joanna Haigh and colleagues now show that these spectral variations — when incorporated into a radiative-photochemical model — lead to decreases in ozone below 45 kilometres and increases above. As a consequence of the ozone changes, radiative forcing of surface climate is out of phase with solar activity. This finding, although based on a short record from a potentially anomalous solar cycle, suggests that a major revision to our current understanding of solar forcing of climate may be in order. Radiative forcing over an '11-year' solar cycle is thought to be in phase with related influences on climate, but recent satellite data reveal a surprising spectral component in solar variability. These authors show that these spectral variations lead to decreases in ozone below 45 km and increases above. As a consequence, radiative forcing of surface climate is out of phase with solar activity, suggesting that a major revision of our current understanding of solar forcing of climate may be required. The thermal structure and composition of the atmosphere is determined fundamentally by the incoming solar irradiance. Radiation at ultraviolet wavelengths dissociates atmospheric molecules, initiating chains of chemical reactions—specifically those producing stratospheric ozone—and providing the major source of heating for the middle atmosphere, while radiation at visible and near-infrared wavelengths mainly reaches and warms the lower atmosphere and the Earth’s surface1. Thus the spectral composition of solar radiation is crucial in determining atmospheric structure, as well as surface temperature, and it follows that the response of the atmosphere to variations in solar irradiance depends on the spectrum2. Daily measurements of the solar spectrum between 0.2 µm and 2.4 µm, made by the Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM) instrument on the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite3 since April 2004, have revealed4 that over this declining phase of the solar cycle there was a four to six times larger decline in ultraviolet than would have been predicted on the basis of our previous understanding. This reduction was partially compensated in the total solar output by an increase in radiation at visible wavelengths. Here we show that these spectral changes appear to have led to a significant decline from 2004 to 2007 in stratospheric ozone below an altitude of 45 km, with an increase above this altitude. Our results, simulated with a radiative-photochemical model, are consistent with contemporaneous measurements of ozone from the Aura-MLS satellite, although the short time period makes precise attribution to solar effects difficult. We also show, using the SIM data, that solar radiative forcing of surface climate is out of phase with solar activity. Currently there is insufficient observational evidence to validate the spectral variations observed by SIM, or to fully characterize other solar cycles, but our findings raise the possibility that the effects of solar variability on temperature throughout the atmosphere may be contrary to current expectations."

The dust mixed in these clouds is thought to be made of grains of an average size of 0.1 micrometer. We report the widespread detection of the coreshine effect as a direct sign of the existence of grown, micrometer-sized dust grains. This effect is seen in half of the cores we have analyzed in our survey, spanning all Galactic longitudes, and is dominated by changes in the internal properties and local environment of the cores, implying that the coreshine effect can be used to constrain fundamental core properties such as the three-dimensional density structure and ages and also the grain characteristics themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2084153237,"Segregation of magma from the mantle in subduction zones is one of the principal mechanisms for chemical differentiation of the Earth. Fundamental aspects of this system, in particular the processes by which melt forms and travels to the Earth's surface, remain obscure. Systematics in the location of volcanic arcs, the surface expression of this melting, are widely considered to be a clue to processes taking place at depth, but many mutually incompatible interpretations of this clue exist (for example, see refs 1-6). We discriminate between those interpretations by the use of a simple scaling argument derived from a realistic mathematical model of heat transfer in subduction zones. The locations of the arcs cannot be explained by the release of fluids in reactions taking place near the top of the slab. Instead, the sharpness of the volcanic fronts, together with the systematics of their locations, requires that arcs must be located above the place where the boundary defined by the anhydrous solidus makes its closest approach to the trench. We show that heat carried by magma rising from this region is sufficient to modify the thermal structure of the wedge and determine the pathway through which both wet and dry melts reach the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2036950961,"We live in a disk galaxy, yet have a very poor understanding of how they form — not helped by the fact that disk galaxies in the early Universe seem rather different to our Milky Way. Many of the disk galaxies of the early Universe are surprisingly large and far more turbulent than the Milky Way and other modern spirals. Now the discovery of a new sample of similarly unusual disk galaxies persisting to the present day adds a significant new element to this debate. In these galaxies, resembling the 'turbulent disks' observed in the early Universe, velocity dispersions correlate with their star-formation rates, which suggests that star formation itself is the energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs. High-resolution observations of early galaxies have shown that two-thirds are massive rotating disk galaxies with velocity dispersions typically five times higher than in today's galaxies. These authors report observations of a sample of rare, high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies. They find that their velocity dispersions are correlated with their star formation rates, but not their masses or gas fractions, suggesting that star formation is the energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs. Observations of star formation and kinematics in early galaxies at high spatial and spectral resolution have shown that two-thirds are massive rotating disk galaxies1,2,3,4,5, with the remainder being less massive non-rotating objects2,4,6,7,8. The line-of-sight-averaged velocity dispersions are typically five times higher than in today’s disk galaxies. This suggests that gravitationally unstable, gas-rich disks in the early Universe are fuelled by cold, dense accreting gas flowing along cosmic filaments and penetrating hot galactic gas halos9,10. These accreting flows, however, have not been observed11, and cosmic accretion cannot power the observed level of turbulence12. Here we report observations of a sample of rare, high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies in the nearby Universe where cold accretion is unlikely to drive their high star formation rates. We find that their velocity dispersions are correlated with their star formation rates, but not their masses or gas fractions, which suggests that star formation is the energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs."
https://openalex.org/W2088161908,"The proteins from the thioredoxin family are crucial actors in redox signaling and the cellular response to oxidative stress. The major intracellular source for oxygen radicals are the components of the respiratory chain in mitochondria. Here, we show that the mitochondrial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (Prx3) is not only substrate for thioredoxin 2 (Trx2), but can also be reduced by glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2) via the dithiol reaction mechanism. Grx2 reduces Prx3 exhibiting catalytic constants (K(m), 23.8 μmol·liter(-1); V(max), 1.2 μmol·(mg·min)(-1)) similar to Trx2 (K(m), 11.2 μmol·liter(-1); V(max), 1.1 μmol·(mg·min)(-1)). The reduction of the catalytic disulfide of the atypical 2-Cys Prx5 is limited to the Trx system. Silencing the expression of either Trx2 or Grx2 in HeLa cells using specific siRNAs did not change the monomer:dimer ratio of Prx3 detected by a specific 2-Cys Prx redox blot. Only combined silencing of the expression of both proteins led to an accumulation of oxidized protein. We further demonstrate that the distribution of Prx3 in different mouse tissues is either linked to the distribution of Trx2 or Grx2. These results introduce Grx2 as a novel electron donor for Prx3, providing further insights into pivotal cellular redox signaling mechanisms."

Well-characterized agonists for the known ANXA1 receptor, FPR2, including the ANXA1 N-terminal proteolytic product ANXA12_26, lipoxin A4 (LXA4), and the synthetic peptide, Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-D-Met (WKYMVm), stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells that was attenuated by incubation with FPR2 antagonists WRW4 (1 µM) or Boc2 (100 nM) or by siRNA against FPR2. FCS-induced mitogenic responses were attenuated by each of the FPR antagonists and by siRNAagainst FPR2 and, to a lesser extent, FPR1. LXA4 increased phosphorylation of Akt, p70S6K but not ERK1/2. Increases in cyclin D1 protein induced by FCS or LXA4 were blocked by the PI3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002, and attenuated by FPR2 antagonism using Boc2.

https://openalex.org/W2017877350,"Wnt/LRP5 signaling is a central regulatory component of bone formative and resorptive activities, and the pathway inhibitor DKK1 is a suppressor of bone formation and bone mass accrual in mice. In addition, augmented DKK1 levels are associated with high bone turnover in diverse low bone mass states in rodent models and disease etiologies in human. However, examination of the precise role of DKK1 in the normal skeleton and in higher species requires the development of refined DKK1-specific pharmacological tools. Here, we report the strategy resulting in isolation of a panel of fully human anti-DKK1 antibodies applicable to studies interrogating the roles of mouse, rhesus, and human DKK1. Selected anti-DKK1 antibodies bind primate and human DKK-1 with picomolar affinities yet do not appreciably bind to DKK2 or DKK4. Epitopes mapped within the DKK1 C-terminal domain necessary for interaction with LRP5/6 and consequently effectively neutralized DKK1 function in vitro. When introduced into naïve normal growing female mice, IgGs significantly improved trabecular bone volume and structure and increased both trabecular and cortical bone mineral densities in a dose-related fashion. Furthermore, fully human DKK1-IgG displayed favorable pharmacokinetic parameters in non-human primates. In summary, we demonstrate here a rate-limiting function of physiologic DKK1 levels in the regulation of bone mass in intact female mice, amendable to specific pharmacologic neutralization by newly identified DKK1-IgGs. Importantly the fully human IgGs display a profile of attributes that recommends their testing in higher species and their use in evaluating DKK1 function in relevant disease models."

https://openalex.org/W2041373157,"Understanding deformation of mineral phases in the lowermost mantle is important for interpreting seismic anisotropy in Earth's interior. Recently, there has been considerable controversy regarding deformation-induced slip in MgSiO(3) post-perovskite. Here, we observe that (001) lattice planes are oriented at high angles to the compression direction immediately after transformation and before deformation. Upon compression from 148 gigapascals (GPa) to 185 GPa, this preferred orientation more than doubles in strength, implying slip on (001) lattice planes. This contrasts with a previous experiment that recorded preferred orientation likely generated during the phase transformation rather than deformation. If we use our results to model deformation and anisotropy development in the D'' region of the lower mantle, shear-wave splitting (characterized by fast horizontally polarized shear waves) is consistent with seismic observations."

By monitoring the deposition of soluble biotinylated FN, we show that the stress-induced TG-FN matrix, a matrix complex of tissue transglutaminase (TG2) with its high affinity binding partner FN, can increase both exogenous and cellular FN deposition and also restore it when cell adhesion is interrupted via the presence of RGD-containing peptides. This mechanism does not require the transamidase activity of TG2 but is activated through an RGD-independent adhesion process requiring a heterocomplex of TG2 and FN and is mediated by a syndecan-4 and β1 integrin co-signaling pathway. By using α5 null cells, β1 integrin functional blocking antibody, and a α5β1 integrin targeting peptide A5-1, we demonstrate that the α5 and β1 integrins are essential for TG-FN to compensate RGD-induced loss of cell adhesion and FN deposition. The importance of syndecan-2 in this process was shown using targeting siRNAs, which abolished the compensation effect of TG-FN on the RGD-induced loss of cell adhesion, resulting in disruption of actin skeleton formation and FN deposition. Unlike syndecan-4, syndecan-2 does not interact directly with TG2 but acts as a downstream effector in regulating actin cytoskeleton organization through the ROCK pathway.

The amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) found within FN and many other matrix proteins is the most widely occurring cell-adhesive motif (1Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2867) Google Scholar). It is the most important recognition site for about half of all known integrins, such as α5β1, αVβ1, αVβ3, and αVβ5 (2Hersel U. Dahmen C. Kessler H. Biomaterials. 2003; 24: 4385-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). However, this cell adhesion process can easily be inhibited by the presence of competitive peptides containing the RGD sequence, often leading to apoptosis (anoikis) (3Buckley C.D. Pilling D. Henriquez N.V. Parsonage G. Threlfall K. Scheel-Toellner D. Simmons D.L. Akbar A.N. Lord J.M. Salmon M. Nature. 1999; 397: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 4Hadden H.L. Henke C.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Such peptides are commonly released during matrix remodeling, a process that is essential to both wound healing and angiogenesis (5Rudolph P. Schubert C. Zelger B.G. Zelger B. Parwaresch R. Am. J. Dermatopathol. 1999; 21: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Liaw L. Crawford H.C. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1999; 32: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 7Verderio E.A. Telci D. Okoye A. Melino G. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42604-42614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Of the integrins, α5β1 integrin is probably the major cell surface integrin that interacts with the RGD-cell binding site on FN, initiating the cell adhesion process (8Langford J.K. Stanley M.J. Cao D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29965-29971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas the binding of αvβ3 integrin to the RGD domain can also support cell adhesion on FN (9Maubant S. Saint-Dizier D. Boutillon M. Perron-Sierra F. Casara P.J. Hickman J.A. Tucker G.C. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Blood. 2006; 108: 3035-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition to the RGD-cell binding domains, the heparin binding sites within FN have also been reported to be involved in cell adhesion because, although cell binding to the RGD-cell binding domains of FN can initiate the cell adhesion process, it is not sufficient to fully support actin cytoskeleton formation, an observation that led to the discovery of the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-4 (10Woods A. Höök M. Kjellén L. Smith C.G. Rees D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Bloom L. Ingham K.C. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1521-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 is the most ubiquitous member of a larger syndecan family that interacts with the heparin binding domains of FN and supports the formation of a cytoskeletal network (12Woods A. Couchman J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13Bass M.D. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A further role of another syndecan family member, syndecan-2, was demonstrated as a downstream molecule in the syndecan-4 signaling pathway (14Kusano Y. Yoshitomi Y. Munesue S. Okayama M. Oguri K. J. Biochem. 2004; 135: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although the intermediate protein(s) mediating this signaling have not been characterized. Apart from supporting the cell adhesion process, cell surface receptors are also involved in the assembly of inactive soluble fibronectin dimers into insoluble fibronectin fibrils to further support the cell adhesion process, among which α5β1 integrins are probably the most efficient regulators and the most widely studied (15Huveneers S. Truong H. Fässler R. Sonnenberg A. Danen E.H. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cell contractility mediated via the actin-myosin cytoskeleton and stimulated via activation of GTPase Rho (16Zhong C. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Brown J. Shaub A. Belkin A.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) is needed to stretch the soluble fibronectin dimers, making the cell surface receptor binding sites available. fibronectin transglutaminase TG2-fibronectin complex focal adhesion kinase mouse embryonic fibroblast(s) Chinese hamster ovary guinea pig liver TG Rho kinase. A further cell surface protein also implicated in cell adhesion and matrix deposition is the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (TG2). This Ca2+-dependent enzyme catalyzes the post-translational modification of proteins either via their cross-linking through ϵ (γ-glutamyl) lysine bridges or by the incorporation of primary amines (17Griffin M. Casadio R. Bergamini C.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Although mainly found intracellularly, during stress/injury situations, TG2 is up-regulated and secreted into the extracellular space by an uncharacterized mechanism, which requires an active site conformation (18Balklava Z. Verderio E. Collighan R. Gross S. Adams J. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16567-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and may involve binding to cell surface FN and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (19Gaudry C.A. Verderio E. Aeschlimann D. Cox A. Smith C. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30707-30714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Scarpellini A. Germack R.

When present at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, TG2 is tightly associated with fibronectin, for which it has a high affinity (19Gaudry C.A. Verderio E. Aeschlimann D. Cox A. Smith C. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30707-30714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In our previous work, we demonstrated that formation of the TG-FN heterocomplex can modulate cell behavior, including cell adhesion and spreading and their relevant signal transduction pathways (7Verderio E.A. Telci D. Okoye A. Melino G. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42604-42614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Balklava Z. Verderio E. Collighan R. Gross S.

Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the TG-FN heterocomplex can compensate for the RGD peptide-induced loss of cell adhesion through a syndecan-4 and β1 integrin co-signaling pathway supporting both cell adhesion and cell survival (22Telci D. Wang Z. Li X. Verderio E.A. Humphries M.J. Baccarini M. Basaga H. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20937-20947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We illustrated how this mechanism could be physiologically important by showing that a TG2-rich conditioned matrix produced by TG2-transfected Swiss 3T3 cells could also compensate for RGD peptide-induced loss of cell adhesion (22Telci D. Wang Z. Li X. Verderio E.A. Humphries M.J. Baccarini M. Basaga H. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20937-20947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We also illustrated how this compensation mechanism is particularly important for cell survival during situations involving matrix remodeling (e.g. wounding and scarring, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis), where high levels of TG2 and RGD peptides are released during the matrix remodeling process (23Verderio E.A. Johnson T. Griffin M. Amino Acids. 2004; 26: 387-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Collighan R.J. Griffin M. Amino Acids. 2009; 36: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Kotsakis P. Griffin M. Amino. Acids. 2007; 33: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have extended this work to explore the involvement of the RGD-independent adhesion mediated by TG-FN matrix in fibronectin matrix assembly, an event central to matrix remodeling and key to the process of many physiological and pathological situations where TG2 is found (26Telci D. Griffin M. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We also explore the involvement of other cell surface receptors in addition to β1 integrin and syndecan-4, including syndecan-2 and α5, α4, and β3 integrins, in this process. Our findings suggest that cell spreading mediated by the TG-FN heterocomplex can lead to fibronectin matrix assembly even in the presence of RGD-containing peptides by a process involving cross-talk between the cell surface receptors syndecan-4, syndecan-2, and α5β1 integrin linked by the intracellular signaling molecule PKCα.

Transfection Of wild type MEF cells with the pSV40/Zeo2 expression vector containing wild TG2 cDNA was achieved by transfecting cells with the 5 μg of vector using a Nucleofector system (AMAXA Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Clones resistant to 800 μg/ml Zeocin (Geneticin, Calbiochem) were screened for overexpression of TG2 by Western blotting as described below.

Unless otherwise stated, cells were detached with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin, and the trypsin was neutralized either with trypsin inhibitor or by the addition of serum-containing medium. Following serum starvation for 16 h, cells were detached as described above and then washed three times with serum-free medium to remove any traces of serum or trypsin inhibitor and pretreated with GRGDTP peptide or its control peptide GRADSP in serum-free medium for 20 min.

Cells were allowed to attach for 20–40 min to minimize the secretion of any endogenous proteins. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained, and digital images per each sample were acquired as stated before (7Verderio E.A. Telci D. Okoye A. Melino G. Griffin M. J. Biol.

The siRNA solutions were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at −20 °C. Before transfection, 3 × 105 cells were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate for 24 h to reach 50–80% confluence. 150 ng of siRNAs were used for each transfection as directed by the manufacturer. Following an approximately 30-h siRNA transfection, cells were used in Western blotting or cell adhesion assay. To visualize the presence of syndecan-2 in the syndecan-2 siRNA-treated MEF cells, the treated cells were seeded into 8-well chambers and incubated with rabbit anti-syndecan-2 antibody (recognizing the intracellular domain of the syndecan-2 core protein) and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody after fixation and permeabilization. The nuclei were detected with propidium iodide, and the signals were detected via confocal microscopy. The sequences of the siRNAs were as follows: SDC-2 siRNA 1, TGGAATTTAATTTGTAGAATA; SDC-2 siRNA 2, CAAAGGCAAATTAATGTGTAA; scrambled siRNA1, GTAAATTATGTAAGTTAGTAT; scrambled siRNA2, GATAATCAAAGCGAAATGTAT. Fibronectin fibril formation was measured by the assembly of exogenously added biotin-labeled FN by a modification of Huveneers et al. (15Huveneers S. Truong H. Fässler R. Sonnenberg A. Danen E.H. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). 6 × 104 cells/well of wild type, syndecan-4 null, β1 integrin null, EA5, and EA5/α5 cells were seeded onto FN or TG-FN in 8-well glass chamber slides. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated with RAD or RGD peptide as described above in the presence or absence of 1 mg/ml heparin. The cells were incubated for 1 h in serum-free medium, and following washing of the adherent cells with serum-free medium, the cells were incubated with 50 nm exogenous biotinylated FN (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) in serum-free medium. After a specified incubation period(s) (1, 3, 6, or 16 h), fixed cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, pH 7.4 (BSA blocking buffer), and the cell matrices were stained with 1 μg/ml Cy5-streptavidin. Slides were mounted with Vectashield mountant (Vector Laboratories) and examined by confocal fluorescent microscopy (Leica Lasertechnik). To detect the deposition of the biotin-labeled FN via Western blotting, 6 × 105 cells (with or without the syndecan-2 siRNA treatment) were seeded onto FN- or TG-FN-precoated 6-well plates. After a certain time course, cell lysates containing both cells and the deposited matrices were scraped into cell lysis buffer (22Telci D. Wang Z. Li X. Verderio E.A. Humphries M.J. Baccarini M. Basaga H. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20937-20947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) Equal amounts of protein from each sample (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and after Western blotting, the biotin-labeled FN was detected by extravidin-peroxidase. The membranes were reprobed for α-tubulin. The amount of deposited fibronectin was quantified by densitometry and normalized to α-tubulin and used as a measure of fibronectin deposited/cell. Wild type MEF cells were detached and washed twice with serum-free medium as described above. Cell suspension with different cell densities (5,000, 1 × 104, or 2 × 104 cells/well) were prepared in serum-free medium in the presence of the RGD or RAD peptides and allowed to adhere on FN or TG-FN matrices for 3 h in 96-well plates. After incubation, the cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4, and the remaining matrices were washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, and blocked with BSA blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-mouse cellular FN monoclonal antibody and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody were used to detect the presence of deposited cellular FN. To visualize the cellular FN fibril formation, immunofluorescence staining was performed by using anti-mouse cellular FN antibody after seeding the cells on FN or TG-FN matrix in the presence of the RGD or RAD peptides for 3 h. Confocal microscopy was performed to detect the signals. Matrix-bound TG2 was detected after incubating the cells with FN or TG-FN matrices for 16 h after detaching the cells with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4. A modified ELISA (7Verderio E.A. Telci D. Okoye A.

Development of the reaction was performed by the addition of OPD solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The color development was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 2.5 m H2SO4, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm using a Spectrafluor plate reader. Results were expressed as absorbance at 450 nm. Subconfluent MEF cells were serum-starved for 16 h, harvested, and pretreated with 100 μg/ml GRADSP or GRGDTP peptides as described above. Cells were seeded in 8-well glass chamber slides (8 × 104 cells/well) previously coated with FN or TG-FN and allowed to attach and spread for 20–40 min. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (7Verderio E.A. Telci D. Okoye A. Melino G. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42604-42614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and then blocked with BSA blocking buffer for 30 min. For the actin stress fiber staining, the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled phalloidin (20 μg/ml) in blocking buffer. For the focal contact staining in MEF cells, after treatment with blocking buffer, the cells were incubated with anti-vinculin antibody (1:100 dilution) followed by anti-mouse IgG-FITC. For the syndecan-2 staining, the cells were seeded into 8-well chambers, and after fixation and permeabilization, the wells were blocked with BSA blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with anti-syndecan-2 antibody at 37 °C for 2 h and with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody at 37 °C for 2 h. Slides were mounted with Vectashield mountant (Vector Laboratories) and examined as mentioned above. Biotinylation of cell surface protein with EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Sigma) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. As described above, after a certain treatment, cells were collected and lysed by the addition of 70 μl of solubilization buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Following a preclearing procedure by centrifuging at 300 × g for 10 min, the samples were stored at −70 °C until use. Western blotting was performed as described previously (7Verderio E.A. Telci D. Okoye A. Melino G. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42604-42614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For the co-immunoprecipitation, cells seeded onto heparin-treated TG-FN or non-treated FN matrices were collected in lysis buffer as described previously (22Telci D. Wang Z. Li X. Verderio E.A.

According to the target protein and antibody selected, either protein A- or G-Sepharose beads and negative control antibodies were used to preclear the cell lysates. The immunocomplexes were obtained via incubating the precleared samples with protein A or G beads and relevant specific antibody against the target protein and collected in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were detected via Western blotting by using their specific antibodies. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. The data shown were derived from one representative experiment (n > 3) undertaken in triplicate. The comparisons between the data sets were performed using Student's t test (two-tailed distribution with equal variance). Statistically significant difference between data sets was defined as by p < 0.05 (two-sided). We first investigated whether TG-FN-mediated cell adhesion can influence FN fibril formation in both the presence and absence of RGD peptides, given the potential importance of this adhesion mechanism in matrix remodeling.

https://openalex.org/W2030079124,"Nucleic acid cytidine deaminases of the activation-induced deaminase (AID)/APOBEC family are critical players in active and innate immune responses, playing roles as target-directed, purposeful mutators. AID specifically deaminates the host immunoglobulin (Ig) locus to evolve antibody specificity, whereas its close relative, APOBEC3G (A3G), lethally mutates the genomes of retroviral pathogens such as HIV. Understanding the basis for the target-specific action of these enzymes is essential, as mistargeting poses significant risks, potentially promoting oncogenesis (AID) or fostering drug resistance (A3G). AID prefers to deaminate cytosine in WRC (W = A/T, R = A/G) motifs, whereas A3G favors deamination of CCC motifs. This specificity is largely dictated by a single, divergent protein loop in the enzyme family that recognizes the DNA sequence. Through grafting of this substrate-recognition loop, we have created enzyme variants of A3G and AID with altered local targeting to directly evaluate the role of sequence specificity on immune function. We find that grafted loops placed in the A3G scaffold all produced efficient restriction of HIV but that foreign loops in the AID scaffold compromised hypermutation and class switch recombination. Local targeting, therefore, appears alterable for innate defense against retroviruses by A3G but important for adaptive antibody maturation catalyzed by AID. Notably, AID targeting within the Ig locus is proportionally correlated to its in vitro ability to target WRC sequences rather than non-WRC sequences. Although other mechanisms may also contribute, our results suggest that local sequence targeting by AID/APOBEC3 enzymes represents an elegant example of co-evolution of enzyme specificity with its target DNA sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2045546922,"Background Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma, with a characteristic clinical presentation, morphology and immunophenotype. Over the past years, the typical translocation t(8;14) and its variants have been considered the molecular hallmark of this tumor. However, BL cases with no detectable MYC rearrangement have been identified. Intriguingly, these cases express MYC at levels comparable with cases carrying the translocation. In normal cells c-Myc expression is tightly regulated through a complex feedback loop mechanism. In cancer, MYC is often dysregulated, commonly due to genomic abnormalities. It has recently emerged that this phenomenon may rely on an alteration of post-transcriptional regulation mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs), whose functional alterations are associated with neoplastic transformation. It is also emerging that c-Myc modulates miRNA expression, revealing an intriguing crosstalk between c-Myc and miRNAs. Principal Findings Here, we investigated the expression of miRNAs possibly regulated by c-Myc in BL cases positive or negative for the translocation. A common trend of miRNA expression, with the exception of hsa-miR-9*, was observed in all of the cases. Intriguingly, down-regulation of this miRNA seems to specifically identify a particular subset of BL cases, lacking MYC translocation. Here, we provided evidence that hsa-miR-9-1 gene is heavily methylated in those cases. Finally, we showed that hsa-miR-9* is able to modulate E2F1 and c-Myc expression. Conclusions Particularly, this study identifies hsa-miR-9* as potentially relevant for malignant transformation in BL cases with no detectable MYC translocation. Deregulation of hsa-miR-9* may therefore be useful as a diagnostic tool, suggesting it as a promising novel candidate for tumor cell marker."
https://openalex.org/W2027498388,"Cell surface glycans play pivotal roles in immune cell trafficking and immunity. Here we present an efficient method for generating anti-carbohydrate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using gene-targeted mice and describe critical glycans in lymphocyte homing. We immunized sulfotransferase GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2 doubly deficient mice with sulfotransferase-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells and generated two mAbs, termed S1 and S2. Both S1 and S2 bound high endothelial venules (HEVs) in the lymphoid organs of humans and wild-type mice, but not in those of doubly deficient mice. Glycan array analysis indicated that both S1 and S2 specifically bound 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X and its defucosylated structure. Interestingly, S2 inhibited lymphocyte homing to peripheral lymph nodes by 95%, whereas S1 inhibited it by only 25%. S2 also significantly inhibited contact hypersensitivity responses and l-selectin-dependent leukocyte adhesion to HEVs. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses indicated that S1 preferentially bound sulfated O-glycans, whereas S2 bound both sulfated N- and O-glycans in HEVs. Furthermore, S2 strongly inhibited the N-glycan-dependent residual lymphocyte homing in mutant mice lacking sulfated O-glycans, indicating the importance of both sulfated N- and O-glycans in lymphocyte homing. Thus, the two mAbs generated by a novel method revealed the cooperative function of sulfated N- and O-glycans in lymphocyte homing and immune surveillance.

Complex carbohydrates play roles in a variety of biological processes, including differentiation, development, immunity, tumor metastasis, and protein quality control (1Varki A. Cummings R.D.

To clarify the functions of complex carbohydrates in vivo, it is essential to determine when, where, and which complex carbohydrate chains are expressed in a particular biological setting of interest. For this purpose, anti-carbohydrate mAbs are particularly useful. However, it is difficult to establish anti-carbohydrate mAbs, largely because a wide variety of complex carbohydrates are intrinsically expressed in mice and rats, which are widely used to generate mAbs. Some of the most well studied functions of complex carbohydrates in immunity are in immune cell trafficking. In particular, lymphocyte homing and recruitment to the peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs) 2The abbreviations used are: PLNperipheral lymph nodeHEVhigh endothelial venuleFucTfucosyltransferaseC1β3GnTcore 1 β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferaseC2GnT-Icore 2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-IGlcNAc6STN-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferaseGlyCAM-1glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1DKOdoubly deficientLacNAcN-acetyllactosamineCHScontact hypersensitivityNeu5AcN-acetylneuraminic acidCmahCMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylaseNeu5GcN-glycolylneuraminic acidMLNmesenteric lymph nodePPPeyer's patchE-PHAPhaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutininAAAAleuria aurantia agglutininCMFDA5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetateCMTMR5-(and-6)-(((4-chloromethyl)benzoyl)amino)tetramethylrhodamineEGFPenhanced GFP. through a specialized endothelium called the high endothelial venule (HEV) have been extensively examined (2von Andrian U.H.

The homing receptor l-selectin, which is expressed on the surface of lymphocytes, specifically interacts with a unique complex carbohydrate structure known as 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X (sialic acidα2–3Galβ1–4[Fucα1-3(sulfo-6)]GlcNAcβ1-R) (4Rosen S.D.

The essential role of this unique carbohydrate structure for lymphocyte homing was revealed mainly through studies using glycosyltransferase- or sulfotransferase-deficient mice. Studies using double-null mice deficient in fucosyltransferase (FucT)-IV and -VII revealed that the fucosylation of HEV ligands is critical for their interaction with l-selectin (6Homeister J.W.

In that work, we performed a detailed carbohydrate structural analysis of glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (GlyCAM-1), which is specifically expressed in HEVs. After metabolically labeling the PLNs with [3H]galactose in organ culture, we purified GlyCAM-1; released its O-glycans by β-elimination; purified each oligosaccharide by gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, and HPLC; and determined the carbohydrate structure by exoglycosidase treatment and HPLC (summarized in supplemental Fig. S2A). Such carbohydrate structural analysis is essential in linking biological structure, and function. However, it is also laborious and time-consuming, especially when using biochemical methods to analyze carbohydrate structures expressed in a minor cell population, such as in HEVs. In this regard, anti-carbohydrate mAbs that react to a specific structure of interest would be very useful, because they can be used in immunohistochemistry, which provides information about the structure as well as the cell types in which the specific carbohydrate antigen is expressed. The anti-carbohydrate mAb, MECA-79, which was generated by immunizing rats with a mouse PLN stromal cell fraction (11Streeter P.R. Rouse B.T. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), has been widely used to detect HEVs in secondary lymphoid organs and HEV-like vessels at sites of chronic inflammation (4Rosen S.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 129-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 12Ley K. Kansas G.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and has proved to be an extremely useful tool for determining the molecules involved in lymphocyte homing. MECA-79 binds various mucin-like glycoproteins called peripheral node addressins modified with l-selectin-reactive sulfated glycans in a sulfation-dependent manner (13Imai Y. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D. Nature. 1993; 361: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 14Hemmerich S. Butcher E.C. Rosen S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2219-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, MECA-79 only partially blocks l-selectin-dependent lymphocyte homing in functional studies (11Streeter P.R. Rouse B.T. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Furthermore, O-glycoprotease-resistant l-selectin ligands, distinct from the MECA-79 antigen, have also been detected (15Clark R.A. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These findings can probably be explained by the fact that MECA-79 recognizes extended core 1 structures containing GlcNAc-6-O-sulfate (16Yeh J.C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Ellies L.G. Rabuka D. Hindsgaul O. Marth J.D. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Cell. 2001; 105: 957-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 1A and fails to bind core 2 branched O-glycans and N-glycans modified with 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X, which are also recognized by l-selectin. The purpose of this study was to develop an efficient method for generating anti-carbohydrate mAbs and to use the mAbs to determine critical glycan structures in lymphocyte homing. The strategy of the method we developed is schematically shown in Fig. 1 (B and C). Gene-targeted mice deficient in a certain glycogene, such as the glycosyltransferase or sulfotransferase gene (gene A KO in Fig. 1B), and glycogene-transfected cells have been extensively used for the functional analysis of complex carbohydrates (Fig. 1B). In the new method described here, the glycogene-deficient mice are immunized with transfected cells overexpressing the glycogene (Fig. 1C). Because the product of the glycogene-encoded enzyme should be highly antigenic in the glycogene-deficient mice, we hypothesized that anti-carbohydrate mAbs could be efficiently generated by this method. In the present study, we immunized GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2 doubly deficient (DKO) mice with transfected cells expressing various glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases, including GlcNAc6ST-2. As a result, we established two anti-carbohydrate mAbs, S1 and S2, which were reactive with HEVs in a sulfation-dependent manner. Although both of the mAbs specifically recognized α2,3-sialylated, GlcNAc-6-O-sulfated N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) terminal structure, S2 but not S1 strongly inhibited lymphocyte homing and contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses. Further analyses revealed that S1 preferentially recognized sulfated O-glycans, whereas S2 recognized both sulfated N- and sulfated O-glycans in HEVs. These results indicate that sulfated N- and sulfated O-glycans function cooperatively in lymphocyte homing and immune surveillance. GlcNAc6ST-1−/−, GlcNAc6ST-2−/−, FucT-IV−/−FucT-VII−/−, GlcNAc6ST-1−/−GlcNAc6ST-2−/−, and C1β3GnT−/−C2GnT-I−/− mice were backcrossed at least five generations to C57BL/6 WT mice and maintained as described previously (6Homeister J.W.

C57BL/6 WT and BALB/c Slc-nu/nu mice were purchased from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan). The mice were treated in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Research Committee of the University of Shizuoka. CHO cells stably expressing human CD34, human FucT-VII, human C1β3GnT, human C2GnT-I, and mouse GlcNAc6ST-2 (CHO/CD34/F7/C1/C2/GlcNAc6ST-2) were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone) and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) and maintained in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). CHO/CD34/F7/C1/C2/GlcNAc6ST-2 cells cultured in a 100-mm dish (BD) were transiently transfected with mouse CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) hydroxylase (Cmah), which generates CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) from CMP-Neu5Ac (17Kawano T.

After 48 h of transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and dispersed with 0.5 mm EDTA-PBS. After centrifugation, the cells were suspended in PBS and mixed with Imject Alum (Pierce) at a ratio of 1:1 in a final volume of 600 μl and vortexed vigorously for 30 min. Two GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2 DKO mice were immunized intraperitoneally three times at 2-week intervals with the cell suspension (250 μl/mouse). Four days after the final immunization, lymphocytes from the spleens of the two DKO mice were fused with P3X63Ag8.653 myeloma cells (American Type Culture Collection) in the presence of PEG solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and selected in the culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and OPI (oxaloacetate, pyruvate, insulin) medium supplement (Sigma-Aldrich)) containing HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine) supplement (Invitrogen) 24 h after fusion. The hybridoma supernatants that reacted with the HEVs of WT mice but not with those of GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2 DKO mice were selected by immunofluorescence as described below. Hybridomas secreting anti-sulfated glycan mAbs thus selected were cloned by limiting dilution and adapted to the culture medium containing HT supplement (Invitrogen). The isotypes of the mAbs S1 and S2 were determined to be mouse IgM (κ) using an isotyping kit (GE Healthcare). Established clones were expanded and injected into BALB/c Slc-nu/nu mice (5.0 × 106 cells/mouse) that had been preinjected with 500 μl/mouse of pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethyl pentadecane; Sigma-Aldrich) a few weeks before the cell injection, and the ascitic fluid was collected by standard procedures. The S1, S2, and MECA-79 mAbs were purified from the ascites fluid using a Sephacryl S-300 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column (1.5 × 100 cm) equilibrated with PBS. The fractions were collected at a flow rate of 12 ml/h, and the protein concentration in each fraction was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel to examine the purity of the IgM. The purified IgM fraction (>95% purity) thus obtained was used for the following experiments. In some cases, purified antibodies were labeled with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Acetone-fixed frozen sections (7-μm) from WT, KO, and DKO mice were incubated with PBS containing 3% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) to block nonspecific binding sites and incubated with biotinylated S1, S2, or MECA-79 (BioLegend). After washing, the sections were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) and mounted using Fluoromount (Diagnostic Biosystems). All of the images were obtained on a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510 META; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a 40× water immersion objective. CHO-K1 cells and two CHO cell-derived mutant lines, Lec1 and Lec2, were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1/EGFP together with pcDNA3.1/mouse GlcNAc6ST-2 or pcDNA3.1/Zeo empty vector at a ratio of 1:20 using a pipette-type electroporator (Neon Transfection System; Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. In some experiments, mouse GlcNAc6ST-1 or mouse GlcNAc6ST-4 was transfected instead of mouse GlcNAc6ST-2. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, dispersed in 2 mm EDTA-PBS, and incubated with 1 μg/ml S1, S2, or MECA-79 (BD). After incubation with the mAbs, the cells were stained with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (1:500 dilution; Vector Laboratories; for S1 and S2) or 2.5 μg/ml biotin-conjugated mouse anti-rat IgM (BD; for MECA-79), followed by 0.5 μg/ml streptavidin-allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate (Beckman Coulter). For flow cytometric analysis of the CHO/CD34/F7/C1/C2/GlcNAc6ST-2 and CHO/CD34/F7/GlcNAc6ST-2 cell lines, the cells were incubated with purified S1, S2, or MECA79, followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (1:250 dilution, for S1 and S2; Vector Laboratories) or FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgM (1:500 dilution, for MECA-79; Open Biosystems). The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCanto II (BD). The data were acquired and analyzed with FACS Diva software (BD) and FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc). The lymphocyte homing assay was performed as described previously with some modifications (9Kawashima H. Petryniak B. Hiraoka N. Mitoma J. Huckaby V. Nakayama J. Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T.

Mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes and splenocytes from WT mice were labeled with 1 or 5 μm 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA; Invitrogen). After washing, 2.0 × 107 cells in 200 μl of PBS were injected intravenously into WT, GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2 DKO, or C1β3GnT and C2GnT-I DKO mice. One hour after the injection, the number of CMFDA+ cells in cell suspensions prepared from the recipient lymphoid organs was determined by flow cytometry. For the lymphocyte homing inhibition experiments, the mice were preinjected via the tail vein with purified S1, S2, or MECA-79 (200 μg/mouse) 2 h before the injection of CMFDA-labeled lymphocytes. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCanto II or a FACSCalibur (BD). The data were acquired and analyzed as described above. The CHS responses were measured as described previously with some modifications (9Kawashima H. Petryniak B. Hiraoka N. Mitoma J. Huckaby V. Nakayama J. Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Lowe J.B.

In brief, 25 μl of 0.2% oxazolone (Sigma-Aldrich) in acetone:olive oil (4:1, v/v) was applied onto the shaved forelegs of mice on day 0. On days 0 and 3, 200 μl of 1 mg/ml mAbs in PBS or PBS alone was intraperitoneally injected. On day 5, the right ear was treated with 20 μl of 0.5% oxazolone (10 μl/side of the pinna), and the left ear was treated with vehicle. Ear swelling was measured using a thickness gauge before and 24 h after treatment. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from the ears of the oxazolone-treated mice were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and observed using a BX-51 microscope (Olympus) with a 20× objective lens. Pictures were taken with a CCD camera, Penguin 600CL (Pixera). Leukocyte adhesion to HEVs was evaluated by the Stamper-Woodruff adhesion assay (19Stamper Jr., H.B. Woodruff J.J. J. Exp.

After three washes with distilled water, the nonspecific binding sites on the cytosections were blocked with buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) containing 3% BSA for 45 min. The sections were then incubated with or without 10 μg/ml MECA-79, purified S1 or S2, rat IgM (BioLegend), or mouse IgM (Rockland) in buffer A containing 0.1% BSA for 90 min at 4 °C. Freshly prepared leukocytes from the WT mouse spleens were labeled with 3.5 μm CellTracker Orange 5-(and-6)-(((4-chloromethyl)benzoyl)amino)tetramethylrhodamine (CMTMR; Lonza Walkersville, Inc.) for 10 min at 37 °C and suspended in 0.1% BSA in buffer A at a cell density of 1.0 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml MEL-14 (Beckman Coulter) or rat IgG (eBioscience) for 10 min on ice before being applied to glass slides. The CMTMR-labeled leukocytes were overlaid onto a glass slide (1.0 × 106 cells/section) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation (60 rpm; Double shaker NR-3, TAITEC). After the removal of nonadherant cells by gentle tapping onto paper towels and dipping into buffer A in a 50-ml centrifuge tube (BD) for 10 s, the sections were fixed in buffer A containing 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. After three washes with distilled water, lymphocyte adhesion was quantified by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51; 20× objective). CHO/CD34/F7/C1/C2/GlcNAc6ST-2 cells cultured as monolayers in 35-mm culture dishes (Corning) were incubated with or without 10 μg/ml purified S1, S2, or MECA-79 for 10 min at room temperature. After incubation, the dishes were equipped with a parallel plate flow chamber (GlycoTech Co.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Freshly prepared leukocytes from the spleens of WT mice were suspended in buffer A containing 0.1% BSA at 1 × 106 cells/ml and introduced into the flow chamber at a wall sheer stress of 2, 1.5, 1, and 0.5 dynes/cm2 using a syringe pump Model 11 Plus (Harvard Apparatus Co.). For the l-selectin inhibition experiment, the leukocyte suspension was preincubated with 10 μg/ml MEL-14 for 10 min at 4 °C. Images were taken with a CCD camera (model ADT-40S; Flovel Co., Ltd.) equipped on an inverted microscope (Olympus CKX41; 20× objective). Glycan array analysis was performed at the Consortium for Functional Glycomics. Microarray slides (printed array version 4.1) containing 465 different glycans were used. In brief, the mAbs were diluted to 10 μg/ml in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% BSA, applied to the printed surface of the array, and incubated at room temperature in a humidified chamber for 1 h. The microarray slide was rinsed four times in buffer B and four times in buffer B without Tween 20, and then fluorescently labeled anti-mouse IgM diluted in buffer B was added to the slide for 1 h. After washing as above, the slide was additionally washed four times with distilled water. Fluorescence intensities of the sample spots were measured using a ProScanArray Scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PLNs from WT, GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2 DKO, or C1β3GnT and C2GnT-I DKO mice were dissected and suspended in PBS containing ice-cold 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (1:200 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich), and solubilized overnight with rotation at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were collected, and their protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit. The lysates thus obtained were stored at −80 °C until use. Western blotting was performed according to standard procedures using biotinylated S1, S2, MECA-79, and E-PHA (Seikagaku Kogyo Co.). The bands were detected with 0.5 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories) and West Pico SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). The use of human tissue sections was approved by the Ethical Committee of Shinshu University School of Medicine. Tissue sections of human tonsil, chronic gastritis, and ulcerative colitis specimens of 3-μm thickness were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in ethanol, and the antigens were retrieved by boiling the sections in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA for 20 min in a microwave oven. The endogenous peroxidase activity of the tissue was then quenched by soaking in absolute methanol containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min, and the nonspecific protein binding was blocked with 1% BSA in TBS for 15 min. The sections were incubated with the MECA-79, S1, and S2 mAbs (5 μg/ml) with 5% BSA in TBS at 4 °C overnight. After washing in TBS, the sections were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rat Ig (Dako) diluted 1:100 with 5% BSA in TBS for 60 min for MECA-79 and with HRP- and anti-mouse Ig-conjugated polymer EnVision+ (Dako) for 30 min for the S1 and S2 mAbs. After washing in TBS, the color reaction was developed in TBS containing 0.2% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Dojindo), and 0.02% hydrogen peroxide for 7 min. The sections were briefly counterstained with hematoxylin. The slides were observed using an AX-80 microscope (Olympus) with a 100× oil immersion objective lens, and pictures were taken using a DP72 CCD camera (Olympus) with DP2-BSW software (Olympus). Student's t test was used for the determination of statistical significance between experimental groups. All of the results were expressed as the means ± S.D. A number of anti-sialyl Lewis X and anti-6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X mAbs have been reported (20Mitoma J. Miyazaki T. Sutton-Smith M. Suzuki M. Saito H. Yeh J.C. Kawano T. Hindsgaul O. Seeberger P.H.

This is probably because a large proportion of the terminal sialic acid in the WT mice is Neu5Gc, whereas these mAbs react with glycans modified with Neu5Ac (20Mitoma J. Miyazaki T. Sutton-Smith M.

To obtain mouse tissue-reactive anti-sulfated glycan mAbs that recognize glycan epitopes more closely related to those that bind l-selectin than those recognized by MECA-79, CHO cells stably expressing CD34, FucT-VII, C1β3GnT, C2GnT-I, and GlcNAc6ST-2 (CHO/CD34/F7/C1/C2/GlcNAc6ST-2 cells) were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding Cmah, which generates CMP-Neu5Gc from CMP-Neu5Ac (17Kawano T.

In most cases, ubiquitin gets attached to an ϵ-amine of a lysine side chain via an isopeptide bond (1Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar) and serves as a molecular tag by providing an additional binding surface, which is recognized by a plethora of different ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) 6The abbreviations used are: UBD, ubiquitin-binding domain; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; TLS, translesion synthesis; Ub, ubiquitin; UBZ, ubiquitin-binding zinc finger; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser and exchange spectroscopy; UPL, upper distance limit; 4NQO, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide. from at least 16 different families (2Hicke L.

J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Most UBDs use α-helical structures to bind a solvent-exposed hydrophobic patch on the β-sheet of ubiquitin, which includes Leu-8, Ile-44, and Val-70. The amino acids surrounding this hydrophobic patch are chemically diverse, thus allowing for different binding modes (2Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 3Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 4Sloper-Mould K.E.

Ubiquitin can be attached on target proteins either as single (monoubiquitination) or multiple single moieties (multiubiquitination), or as several ubiquitins covalently bound to each other in a chain-like fashion (polyubiquitination). These chains can be linked to the N terminus or any of the seven different lysines of ubiquitin; Lys-11 and Lys-48 are the most frequently used, whereas Lys-48 and Lys-63 are the best studied (5Ikeda F. Dikic I. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). How ubiquitin tags and chains are specifically recognized by the different UBDs remains an important but poorly understood question (2Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol.

EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3903-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). NMR spectroscopy revealed that individual ubiquitin moieties in Lys-63-linked chains resemble beads on a string, whereas ubiquitins in Lys-48-linked chains fold onto each other (9Varadan R.

Moreover, the binding preference is not conserved within domain families (3Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 11Long J.

The UBD-containing proteins that bind to the ubiquitinated substrate determine the elicited biological response (2Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 3Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). For example, ubiquitin conjugation as monoubiquitin and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains emerged as important determinants to ensure faithful DNA replication and genomic stability (14Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). In particular, ubiquitination of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is thought to signal an appropriate DNA damage response and controls the switch from processive DNA replication to translesion synthesis (TLS) at stalled forks. A set of conserved, error-prone polymerases can bypass the lesion, which would otherwise block DNA replication. Evidence suggests that the functional integrity of specialized UBDs classified as UBM and UBZ domains is essential for the proper localization of TLS polymerases to damage-induced stalled replication foci and for cellular survival following DNA damage (15Waters L.S. Minesinger B.K. Wiltrout M.E. D'Souza S. Woodruff R.V. Walker G.C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 134-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Interestingly, UBM and UBZ domains are less dependent on Ile-44 in the classical binding patch on ubiquitin compared with other UBDs (16Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), raising the question whether these domains interact with ubiquitin through a distinct binding mode. Very recently, an NMR structure of the UBM2 domain of human polymerase iota (Pol ι) fused to GB1 (17Zhou P. Lugovskoy A.A. Wagner G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) in complex with ubiquitin has been published (Protein Data Bank codes 2KHU and 2KHW) (18Bomar M.G. D'Souza S. Bienko M. Dikic I.

Binding affinities of ubiquitin to the wild type and mutated fusion protein were analyzed using isothermal titration calorimetry. Confirming earlier results (16Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N.

Here, we report the NMR solution structures of the two UBM domains of the murine Y-family translesion Pol ι (see domain organization in supplemental Fig. 1) in complex with ubiquitin. Despite their low sequence identity of 25%, both small UBMs fold into a similar, previously unreported helix-turn-helix motif that is independent of its binding partner ubiquitin. Our detailed structural and mutational analysis revealed that both UBM domains bind ubiquitin using the usual binding surface for UBDs. However, not the entire hydrophobic surface of ubiquitin is used, and in addition, electrostatic interactions stabilize the binding. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that UBM2 excludes Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains but binds to any freely accessible ubiquitin binding surface with similar strength. We conclude that UBM domains assemble in a novel structural fold that ensures specific ubiquitin binding by a mechanism resembling allovalency, which is important for error-free DNA synthesis in vivo. UBM1 and UBM2 single domain constructs were cloned into a pGEX-4T vector as a C-terminal fusion to GST; ubiquitin was encoded on pET19b. Single amino acid substitutions used for fluorescence titrations were obtained using site-directed mutagenesis. All plasmids contained an ampicillin/carbenicillin resistance gene for selection and a lac-inducible T7 promotor. Clones were confirmed via sequence analysis. Unlabeled, 15N- and 15N,13C-labeled protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21DE3Star (Invitrogen) in LB (unlabeled) or M9 minimal medium. Cells were grown at 37 °C, induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final), harvested upon growth arrest, and resuspended in lysis buffer (1× PBS, 300 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 150 μm PMSF, cOmplete inhibitor tablets (Roche)) at a ratio of 5 ml/g wet pellet. Cells were lysed by French press and cleared of insoluble parts by centrifugation at 48,000 × g. The GST-fusion proteins were bound in batch mode on freshly prepared glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) at room temperature for 3 h. The beads were washed five times each with lysis buffer and PBS (10 times bead volume). UBM domains were cleaved off using thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) (UBM1, 10 units/ml, 25 °C for 20 h; UBM2, 5 units/ml, 15 °C for 12 h). For ubiquitin, the bulk of the proteins were precipitated using perchloric acid at a final concentration of 3.5% and 40 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation at 48,000 × g, the supernatant containing ubiquitin was neutralized using saturated Tris base solution. Buffers were exchanged to ion exchange binding buffers (UBMs, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 8.5; Ub, 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5) using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column, and the proteins were bound to a Resource Q (UBMs) or Resource S (Ub) ion exchange column, of which they were eluted by a gradient of elution buffer (UBMs, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 m NaCl, pH 8.5; Ub, 250 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.6). Rebuffering to NMR buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 100 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm CHAPS, pH 6.0) was performed using a Superdex 75 10/30 gel filtration column. Typical yields per liter medium were 2.5 and 25 mg, for unlabeled UBMs and ubiquitin, respectively, and 1.6 and 15 mg for the corresponding labeled proteins. All NMR experiments were performed at 15 °C. For UBM1, the initial titrations with unlabeled ubiquitin as well as heteronuclear NOE experiments were performed with 15N-labeled UBM1* that contained additional flanking residues, all other experiments with UBM1 (supplemental Fig. 3). Titrations to characterize the binding interaction and for thermal denaturation were recorded as series of [1H,15N]- and [1H,13C]-HSQC spectra, respectively. For the characterization of protein-protein interactions, the isotope-labeled compound was 7-fold overtitrated with its unlabeled binding partner. Combined chemical shift changes (Δδ) were calculated using the formulas Δδ = Δδ(H1)2+(15Δδ(N15))2 for 1H attached to 15N and Δδ = Δδ(H1)2+(14Δδ(C13))2 for 1H attached to 13C, respectively (19Schumann F.H. Riepl H. Maurer T. Gronwald W. Neidig K.P. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Biomol. NMR. 2007; 39: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Chemical shift changes Δδ were fitted assuming one interaction site per molecule using the formula, Δδ = Δδmax(((KD + [L0] + [P0]) − (KD+[L0]+[P0])2−(4[P0][L0]))/2[P0]), where Δδ is the chemical shift change, Δδmax is the chemical shift change at saturation, KD is the dissociation constant, [L0] is the total ligand (Ub) concentration, and [P0] is the total protein (UBM) concentration (20Fielding L. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2007; 51: 219-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The maximal Δδ values were reached at ∼4-fold overtitration; this ratio was used for all NMR samples to saturate the NMR-observable isotope-labeled compound in the complexes of UBMs and ubiquitin with unlabeled binding partner (supplemental Fig. 2). Sequence-specific resonance assignment of the different constructs was based on HNCA, HNCACB (supplemental Fig. 13), and HCcH-COSY as well as 13C- and 15N-resolved [1H-1H]-NOESY experiments. Overall, >97% of all the resonances in the spectra of the UBM·ubiquitin complexes were assigned. For the determination of the structure of the UBM·ubiquitin complexes, 13C- and 15N-resolved [1H-1H]-NOESY experiments (mixing time, 80 ms) were acquired. For the characterization of the binding interface 13C-resolved [1H,1H-(12C-edited)]-NOESY experiments (mixing time, 120 ms) were measured of 13C,15N-labeled UBM domains in complex with unlabeled ubiquitin and vice versa (21Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The NOEs in these spectra were analyzed and assigned manually and added to the otherwise automated structure calculation, during which they were verified. Structure calculations of UBM-ubiquitin complexes were performed using UNIO'08 1.0.4, which combines ATNOS/CANDID (22Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol.

Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar) with different molecular dynamics programs. We used the following input: a set of 15N-resolved and aromatic and aliphatic 13C-resolved [1H-1H]-NOESYs for labeled UBM overtitrated with unlabeled ubiquitin and vice versa (six spectra per UBM-Ub complex), a list of ambiguous and unambiguous intermolecular upper distance constraints (UPLs) all set to 5.5 Å, a combined assignment list of both binding partners and the amino acid sequence of the complex, containing a 22-dummy residue linker between UBM and ubiquitin for CYANA (24Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar) calculations. The lists of intermolecular UPLs (136 or 99 ambiguous and 36 or 73 unambiguous UPLs for UBM1 or UBM2, respectively) were automatically evaluated during the structure calculation using a consistency check and network anchoring (23Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). In the final step, 97 and 96 unambiguous intermolecular UPLs were available for the complexes of UBM1 and UBM2, respectively.

The measurements were performed at 24 °C with initial concentrations of UBM2 of 30 μm; excitation and emission wavelengths were at 280 and 345 nm, respectively. Titrations were repeated four times, and the binding curves were fitted using F = FA × C̄A + ΔF × ½(g − g2−h), where g = C̄S + KD + pC̄A, h = 4pC̄AC̄S, and ΔF = FAS − FA. FA and FAS represent the fluorescence signal of free protein A (UBM2) and the complex AS (UBM2·Ub), respectively, C̄A is the total concentration of UBM2, C̄S is the total concentration of the substrate S (Ub), and p is the stoichiometry value (28Groemping Y. Hellmann N. Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2005; 39: 20.28.21-20.28.27Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). All yeast strains used in this study (supplemental Table 1) were derived from LHY461 (4Sloper-Mould K.E. Jemc J.C. Pickart C.M. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30483-30489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), where the four endogenous Ub genes have been deleted, and Ub is only expressed from a LYS2-marked plasmid. Strains expressing Ub mutants were obtained by transforming LHY461 with URA3-marked plasmids encoding wild type or the T66A, H68A, and T9A Ub mutants (4Sloper-Mould K.E. Jemc J.C. Pickart C.M. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30483-30489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The transformants were propagated on a medium containing aminoadipate to counterselect the LYS2-marked plasmid and therefore obtain new strains expressing Ub from the URA3-marked plasmids. The rev1Δ strains expressing different Ub mutants were obtained similarly after having first replaced REV1 in LHY461 by a KAN resistance cassette using homologous recombination. To analyze the genetic interaction between REV1 deletion and ubiquitin mutants, we spotted equivalent amounts of each strain in 5-fold serial dilutions onto yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) plates containing increasing concentrations of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO, Sigma). Pictures of the plates were recorded after 3 days of growth at 30 °C. For the determination of the solution structure of the two UBM domains, UBM1 and UBM2 of murine Pol ι in complex with ubiquitin, we expressed the two domains as GST-fusion proteins in E. coli and cleaved GST with thrombin. The final sequences of the domains are reported in supplemental Fig. 3. The structures of both UBMs within the UBM·ubiquitin complex are well defined, and the important features defining the UBM structures and binding mode to Ub were the same for UBM1 (Fig. 1A) and UBM2 (Fig. 1B). The structures of the entire Ub·UBM1 and Ub·UBM2 complexes are well defined with overall backbone root mean square deviation values of 0.67 ± 14 Å and 0.54 ± 12 Å, respectively (Table 1). With the almost complete assignment of the spectra, NOE data are fully used, and a further refinement of the structures requires additional data, e.g. residual dipolar couplings or scalar couplings. However, averaging of these parameters over free and bound conformations has potentially much more detrimental effects on the structure than the averaging of NOEs (see also “Discussion”). Thus, we decided to stay with the given precision, which is also sufficient for the characterization of the binding interface. The structures consisted of a yet unreported type of the helix-turn-helix motif (see “Discussion”) where the first helix was longer than the second, and the turn was comprised of a highly conserved Leu-Pro motif. This motif has a similar spatial arrangement for UBM1 and UBM2 (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 4; positioning on ubiquitin is shown in supplemental Fig. 5). In UBM1, the helices included residues 502–507 and 510–517, and in UBM2, helices included 687–692 and 695–707. These residues showed protection against exchange of amide hydrogens to deuterons in a NMR spectrum measured 30 min after buffer exchange from H2O to D2O, indicating the presence of hydrogen bonds. The N termini of both UBM domains and the C terminus of UBM1 were partially folded and looped back onto the structure extending the hydrophobic surface (Fig. 1, A and B) and contributing to a small hydrophobic core. UBM1 was only comprised of a very small hydrophobic core between the two helices, which consisted of parts of the residues Leu-496, Pro-497, Val-500, Phe-505, Leu-508, and Ile-516 (Fig. 1D). The larger hydrophobic core of UBM2 was composed of the four aromatic side chains of Phe-681, Phe-690, Tyr-691, and Trp-705 and the aliphatic residues Leu-679, Pro-687, Leu-701, and Met-702 (Fig. 1E). Our data on UBM1 and UBM2 indicate that both domains are folded in complex with ubiquitin. The generally small chemical shift changes upon titration of the free domains with ubiquitin (supplemental Fig. 6, A and B) suggest that they adopt a very similar conformation free in aqueous solution as in the complex. This conclusion is supported by heteronuclear NOE measurements between protons and nitrogens in the backbone amide groups, which provide a measure of the rigidity of the polypeptide backbone (29Renner C. Schleicher M. Moroder L. Holak T.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Zhu G. Xia Y. Nicholson L.K. Sze K.H. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 143: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although the backbone rigidity of UBM2 only marginally increased upon ubiquitin binding (Fig. 2G), a bigger increase in rigidity was observed with UBM1, although both leveled off at comparable values of 0.8 on the ordinate for the core of the domains. The smaller hydrophobic core of UBM1 may explain its higher structural flexibility compared with UBM2. However, thermal denaturation experiments with free UBM1 and UBM2 monitored by NMR and by CD spectroscopy failed to reveal a clear transition between the folded and unfolded state. Instead, a gradual change"

Here we used a micropore UV irradiation assay to examine Cdt2 accumulation at cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-containing DNA-damaged sites in the process of Cdt1 degradation in HeLa cells. Cdt2, present in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, accumulated rapidly at damaged DNA sites during G1 phase. The recruitment of Cdt2 is dependent on prior PCNA chromatin binding because Cdt2 association was prevented when PCNA was silenced. Cdt1 was also recruited to damaged sites soon after UV irradiation through its PIP-box. As Cdt1 was degraded, the Cdt2 signal at damaged sites was reduced, but PCNA, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, and XPA (xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group A) signals remained at the same levels. These findings suggest that Cdt1 degradation following UV irradiation occurs rapidly at damaged sites due to PCNA chromatin loading and the recruitment of Cdt1 and CRL4Cdt2, before DNA damage repair is completed.

Despite numerous studies, the detailed molecular mechanism of defective enamel formation is still unknown. In this study, we have examined the biophysical properties of a recombinant murine amelogenin (rM180) and two point mutations identified from human DNA sequences in two cases of AI (T21I and P41T). At pH 5.8 and 25 °C, wild type (WT) rM180 and mutant P41T existed as monomers, and mutant T21I formed lower order oligomers. CD, dynamic light scattering, and fluorescence studies indicated that rM180 and P41T can be classified as a premolten globule-like subclass protein at 25 °C. Thermal denaturation and refolding monitored by CD ellipticity at 224 nm indicated the presence of a strong hysteresis in mutants compared with WT. Variable temperature tryptophan fluorescence and dynamic light scattering studies showed that WT transformed to a partially folded conformation upon heating and remained stable. The partially folded conformation formed by P41T, however, readily converted into a heterogeneous population of aggregates. T21I existed in an oligomeric state at room temperature and, upon heating, rapidly formed large aggregates over a very narrow temperature range. Thermal denaturation and refolding studies indicated that the mutants are less stable and exhibit poor refolding ability compared with WT rM180. Our results suggest that alterations in self-assembly of amelogenin are a consequence of destabilization of the intrinsic disorder. Therefore, we propose that, like a number of other human diseases, AI appears to be due to the destabilization of the secondary structure as a result of amelogenin mutations.

Tooth enamel is one of the hardest and most heavily mineralized vertebrate tissues that can withstand wear without catastrophic failure during the entire life span of an organism (1Robinson C. Connell S. Kirkham J. Shore R. Smith A. J. Mater. Chem. 2004; 14: 2242-2248Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Chai H. Lee J.J. Constantino P.J. Lucas P.W. Lawn B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7289-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The formation of enamel takes place in an extracellular environment, including an array of complex proteins and proteases in three main stages, namely the secretory, transition, and maturation stages (3Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 84-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). As the enamel development progresses, proteases such as enamelysin (MMP-20) and later kallikrein 4 (KLK-4) cleave the proteins, which are removed from the mineralization site in the extracellular matrix enabling the growth of enamel crystals and resulting in enamel hardness. Thus, during amelogenesis, the soft mineralized tissue formed during the early stages becomes hard and tough and almost devoid of any proteins at the maturation stage. Amelogenin is the major constituent (∼90%) of the protein matrix during the secretory stage and, together with other proteins in enamel, is responsible for the hierarchical structure observed in the enamel prisms (4Snead M.L.

In addition, we used various computational and experimental approaches to identify unfolded regions in amelogenin, further supporting the notion that it is a member of the IDP family (10Moradian-Oldak J. Lakshminarayanan R. Goldberg M. Amelogenins: Multifaceted Proteins for Dental and Bone Formation. Bentham Science Publishers Ltd., Dubai, U.A.E.2010: 106Google Scholar). Unlike folded proteins, IDPs lack regular secondary or tertiary structure and instead exist in an ensemble of conformations (9Lakshminarayanan R. Il Y. Hegde B.G. Du C. Fan D. Moradian-Oldak J. Proteins. 2009; 76: 560-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The resultant extended structure is thought to provide an increased surface area of interaction, the flexibility to interact with different partners, induced folding upon binding to partners, and accessibility to post-translational modifications (11Dunker A.K.

Notably, amelogenin exhibits properties that are hallmarks of IDPs, such as susceptibility to proteolysis, a high abundance of proline, and the ability to interact with other matrix components (8Delak K.

A number of acidic extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) associated with bone and tooth formation have also been characterized as being disordered (15Huq N.L. Cross K.J. Ung M. Reynolds E.C. Arch.

Commun. 2001; 280: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition of amelogenin, however, differs from that of other ECM proteins. It lacks an appreciable amount of charged residues but contains higher amounts of hydrophobic residues (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, in a charge-hydrophobicity plot amelogenin is placed at the border between the completely disordered and natively folded proteins (8Delak K. Harcup C. Lakshminarayanan R. Sun Z. Fan Y.

Biomaterials. 2004; 25: 5091-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Of the 23 mutations reported to date, 14 of the mutations are identified in the AMELX gene. These coding errors can disturb the secretion of amelogenin, produce mutations in the tyrosine-rich amelogenin polypeptide (TRAP) region, and cause truncation of amelogenin at the C terminus. All of these changes can contribute to defective enamel formation. Clinical manifestations of AI are heterogeneous and vary depending on the affected gene and location of the mutation. The enamel structure of the affected individuals is defined as either hypoplasia or hypomineralization or a combination of these (19Wright J.T. Hart P.S. Aldred M.J. Seow K. Crawford P.J. Hong S.P. Gibson C.W. Hart T.C. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 72-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three missense mutations at the N terminus of human amelogenin involve substitution of threonine 21 to isoleucine (T21I), proline 40 to threonine (P40T), and histidine 47 to isoleucine (H47I). The T21I substitution in human amelogenin results in a phenotype described as hypomineralized/hypomatured enamel with brown discoloration (20Lench N.J. Winter G.B. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 5: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The P40T mutation results in hypomaturation with a discolored phenotype (21Hart P.S. Aldred M.J. Crawford P.J. Wright N.J. Hart T.C. Wright J.T. Arch. Oral Biol. 2002; 47: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The regular hierarchical prism structure observed in enamel is lacking the hypomineralized enamel, and the overall enamel shows porous and disoriented carbonated apatite crystals (22Mahoney E.K. Rohanizadeh R. Ismail F.S. Kilpatrick N.M. Swain M.V. Biomaterials. 2004; 25: 5091-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the hypomineralized enamel exhibits poor hardness and elastic modulus compared with the unaffected enamel (23Xie Z. Swain M. Munroe P. Hoffman M. Biomaterials. 2008; 29: 2697-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Xie Z.H. Mahoney E.K. Kilpatrick N.M. Swain M.V. Hoffman M. Acta Biomater. 2007; 3: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As a result, the defective enamel fractures readily. The amino acid sequences of amelogenin across different vertebrates are highly conserved (25Toyosawa S. O'hUigin C. Figueroa F. Tichy H. Klein J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although the T21I point mutation from the human sequence occurs in an identical position in mouse amelogenin, the human P40T mutation occurs as Pro-41 in the mouse due to an additional methionine at residue 29 in the mouse (supplemental Fig. S1). Using recombinant mouse amelogenin and the AI mutants, Moradian-Oldak et al. (26Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) have shown that the mutant amelogenins generated more heterogeneous assemblies than the wild type. It has been further reported that the interactions between wild type and AI variants are reduced by about 43% for the T21I mutant and 26% for the P41T mutants (27Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Dickerson K. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17112-17116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Tanimoto et al. (28Tanimoto K. Le T. Zhu L. Witkowska H.E. Robinson S. Hall S. Hwang P. Denbesten P. Li W. J. Dent. Res. 2008; 87: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have shown that the P41T mutation reduced the interaction of amelogenin with MMP-20, and the observed reduction in processing was purported to play an important role in the defective enamel formation. Despite these studies, details on the etiology of AI and the associated phenotypes remain largely unknown. Alterations in the self-assembly properties of amelogenin as a result of mutations are a clear manifestation of differences in enamel structure, and considerable insights can be gained by examining their physical and chemical properties. In this study, to gain more insight into the detailed secondary structures, degree of intrinsic disorder, and the changes in physico-chemical properties, we assessed the impact of T21I and P41T point mutations on recombinant full-length wild type (WT) mouse amelogenin (rM180) by circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence techniques. We justify the use of recombinant proteins for the following reasons. 1) The differences in sequence between recombinant and native amelogenin are minimal and do not have a significant effect on protein self-assembly (26Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Simmer J.P. Lau E.C. Hu C.C. Aoba T. Lacey M. Nelson D. Zeichner-David M. Snead M.L. Slavkin H.C. Fincham A.G. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). 2) Recombinant amelogenin has been demonstrated to be an excellent model for the study of amelogenin self-assembly (5Moradian-Oldak J. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7Wiedemann-Bidlack F.B. Beniash E. Yamakoshi Y. Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. J. Struct.

Tissue Int. 1994; 55: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 3) Purification of native mouse amelogenin in substantial quantities free of contamination is difficult. Preparation of the recombinant His-tagged rM180 and the mutants have been described elsewhere (26Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The proteins were further purified on a Jupiter C4 semi-preparative reversed phase column (10 × 250 mm, 5 μm) Varian Prostar HPLC system (ProStar/Dynamics 6, version 6.41, Varian, Palo Alto, CA). A linear gradient of 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 2 ml/min was used. The amino acid sequence of mouse and human amelogenins shares ∼86% identity, and the two mutational spots are highly conserved (supplemental Fig. S1). Compared with the native mouse amelogenin sequence, all the proteins contain “RGHHHHHHGS” residues at the N terminus and lack a phosphorylation on Ser-16 (supplemental Fig. S2) (26Moradian-Oldak J. Paine M.L. Lei Y.P. Fincham A.G. Snead M.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 30Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Sarte P.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 55: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CD spectra were obtained with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (A J-815 was used to perform the experiments displayed in supplemental Fig. S3) at a protein concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8. Unless otherwise stated, the same concentration and buffer were used for all other experiments. The far UV-CD spectra were recorded using a 0.1-cm path length cell under constant nitrogen flush with a step size of 0.1 nm, bandwidth of 2 nm, and an averaging time of 3 s. The final spectra reported were an average of 16 scans. All the spectra were background-subtracted and smoothed by the Savitzky-Golay method using a window size of 5 nm (no smoothing was performed for any of the scans performed by the J-815). For the variable temperature CD spectra, an external thermostat was used that controlled the temperature to within 0.1 °C. The thermal denaturation of proteins was determined by monitoring the changes in CD intensity at 200 and 224 nm for all the proteins. The protein solutions were heated from 10 to 70 °C and then cooled back to 10 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. For the thermal stability measurements, the data obtained from CD intensity at 200 nm were fit into a two-state model using the Origin 7.5 software. The thermodynamic parameters were determined by the procedure reported by Pace and Scholtz (31Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1997: 299-321Google Scholar). For the refolding kinetics, protein solutions (0.4 mg/ml) were heated to 70 °C and kept at that temperature for 5 min before being cooled to 25 °C. Changes in CD intensity at 200 nm as a function of time were then monitored. We noted that rM180 and P41T rapidly returned to equilibrium. We therefore monitored the changes from the denaturation temperature onward. The samples reached 25 °C in 70 s, and the data were fit into a single exponential function using Origin 7.5 software. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra were recorded on a QuantaMaster QM-4SE spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International). The protein solution (0.4 mg/ml, pH 5.8, sodium acetate buffer (25 mm), 25 °C) was excited at 290 nm, and the emission spectra were monitored between 300 and 400 nm with a step size of 1 nm, using a 10-mm path length cell. For variable temperature measurements, the Peltier controller was used. The temperature scan was performed at 5 °C intervals from 25 to 70 °C. Measurements were made at each temperature after 5 min to allow the sample to equilibrate in the cell. 8-Anilinonaphthalene sulfonate (ANS) fluorescence was recorded after excitation of the dye or dye-protein complexes at 350 nm. The emission spectra were monitored between 400 and 600 nm. Measurements of the hydrodynamic radii of the various amelogenin proteins (0.4 mg/ml, pH 5.8, 25 mm sodium acetate buffer) were performed using a Wyatt DynaPro Nanostar dynamic light scattering instrument (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). For room temperature experiments, the temperature was set to 25 °C, although variable temperature experiments were performed between 20 and 60 °C at a ramp rate of 0.25 °C/min. The data were analyzed using Dynamics 7.0 software. The dynamic light scattering data were produced by the program performing a regularization fit using the Dynals algorithm on the resultant autocorrelation functions. A Rayleigh sphere model was used for the analysis, meaning that the hydrodynamic radii calculated were sphere-equivalent radii. By measuring the fluctuations in the laser light intensity scattered by the sample, the instrument was able to detect the speed (diffusion coefficient) at which the particles were moving through the medium. This value is converted to hydrodynamic radius using the Stokes-Einstein relation shown in Equation 1,D=kT6πηRH(Eq. 1) where D is the is the diffusion coefficient; k is the Boltzmann constant; T is the absolute temperature; η is the viscosity, and RH is the sphere-equivalent hydrodynamic radius (32Schärtl W. Light Scattering from Polymer Solutions and Nanoparticle Dispersions. 1st Ed. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2007Google Scholar). The secondary structures of WT rM180 and mutant amelogenins were recorded in 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8. At 25 °C, WT and mutant amelogenins all exhibited a strong negative minimum around 202 nm, which is characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins (Fig. 1A). For the T21I mutant, CD spectra showed a similar minimum around 202 nm, but the CD intensity was much lower than the other two proteins. Steady state tryptophan fluorescence is a useful technique to probe the environment around the aromatic amino acid residues (33Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar, 34Shen C. Menon R. Das D. Bansal N. Nahar N. Guduru N. Jaegle S. Peckham J. Reshetnyak Y.K. Proteins. 2008; 71: 1744-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Illuminating proteins with 290-nm excitation wavelength selectively excites tryptophan. Fig. 1B shows the plot of normalized emission intensity versus emission wavelength for all three amelogenins at 25 °C. Both the WT and the P41T mutant had an emission maximum around 346 nm, a characteristic feature of “class III” proteins that have tryptophan residues exposed to mobile water molecules (34Shen C. Menon R. Das D. Bansal N. Nahar N. Guduru N. Jaegle S. Peckham J. Reshetnyak Y.K. Proteins. 2008; 71: 1744-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, for the T21I mutant, the maximum was blue-shifted to 338 nm (characteristic of “class II” proteins) indicating partially buried nature of the fluorophores. DLS allows the measurement of hydrodynamic radii of proteins. DLS studies revealed that WT rM180 and the P41T mutant had hydrodynamic radii of 3.4 and 3.5 nm, respectively (Table 1), which are smaller than expected for a completely extended conformation (4.2 nm) and larger than for a globular conformation (2.2 nm) of proteins with the same amino acid chain lengths (35Uversky V.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Based on the analysis of CD spectra and hydrodynamic dimensions, Uversky classified IDPs into intrinsic coil-like and intrinsic premolten globule-like (PMG) proteins (36Uversky V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). The two subclasses can be distinguished by the relationship between increases in hydrodynamic radii and molecular weight (36Uversky V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C compares the hydrodynamic radii of PMG-like proteins with that of rM180 and P41T mutant. The hydrodynamic radii for the two proteins have an excellent agreement with the dimensions of PMG-like proteins. To further confirm that rM180 and P41T belong to the PMG-like subclass, ANS binding assays were recorded (Fig. 1D). Excitation of ANS at 350 nm had an emission maximum at 505 nm in acetate buffer, pH 5.8. However, when added to rM180 or P41T mutant, the fluorescence maximum was blue-shifted to 475 nm, and an 18–20-fold increase in intensity of ANS was observed in comparison with the emission in the absence of rM180 or P41T (Fig. 1D). Thus, ANS fluorescence and DLS measurements confirm that at pH 5.8 and 25 °C, rM180 and the P41T mutant are monomeric and more compact (PMG-like) than completely extended IDPs. Interestingly, at the same pH and protein concentration, the T21I mutant existed as an oligomer with a hydrodynamic radius of 7 nm (Table 1).TABLE 1Hydrodynamic radii and polydispersity values (% PD) of rM180 and the mutants at 25 °C, pH 5.8, as determined by DLS analysisProteinRHMassPDnm%%rM1803.41 ± 0.1597.04 ± 1.0924.29 ± 10.97T21I7.07 ± 0.2398.81 ± 1.5234.6 ± 9.81P41T3.52 ± 0.1198.98 ± 1.0641.97 ± 12.19 Open table in a new tab A hallmark of IDPs is that the heat-induced conformational transition is reversible (37Uversky V.N. Protein J. 2009; 28: 305-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To infer the effect of temperature on WT rM180 and the two AI mutants, the thermal denaturation/refolding behavior of amelogenins was examined by monitoring the CD intensity at 224 nm as a function of temperature. Fig. 2, A–C, show the changes in CD intensity at 224 nm as a function of temperature for the three proteins. Unlike the linear thermal transition observed for recombinant porcine amelogenin and other IDPs, rM180 exhibited a biphasic behavior (Fig. 2A) (8Delak K. Harcup C. Lakshminarayanan R. Sun Z. Fan Y. Moradian-Oldak J. Evans J.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9Lakshminarayanan R. Il Y. Hegde B.G. Du C. Fan D. Moradian-Oldak J. Proteins. 2009; 76: 560-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At low temperatures, the CD intensity increased with temperature indicating a noncooperative unfolded-to-folded transition. Above 45 °C, denaturation began with a concomitant reduction in CD intensity (indicated by black arrow in Fig. 2A), as has been observed for folded proteins (38Hill R.B. DeGrado W.F. Structure. 2000; 8: 471-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On cooling (open circles), the CD intensity retraced back slowly, and refolding began at 50 °C (indicated by red arrow in Fig. 2A). Complete refolding occurred at around 41 °C (indicated by blue arrow in Fig. 2A), and the CD intensity followed the same path as the heating cycle upon further cooling. Thus, WT rM180 exhibited a weak hysteresis upon denaturation (heating) and refolding (cooling). While heating the T21I mutant, the CD intensity increased at a similar rate, but it decreased much more sharply above 45 °C and reached a plateau at higher temperatures (Fig. 2B). On cooling, the intensity retraced more slowly than rM180 and refolding began below 42 °C (indicated by red arrow in Fig. 2B), and the process was completed at 33 °C (indicated by blue arrow in Fig. 2B). Thus, the T21I mutant exhibited a larger hysteresis deflection than was observed for rM180. The denaturation of the P41T mutant followed the same path as rM180 (Fig. 2C). The onset of refolding, however, occurred around 45 °C (indicated by red arrow in Fig. 2C), but complete refolding was achieved only below 30 °C (indicated by blue arrow in Fig. 2B). The loss in CD intensity at elevated temperatures suggests that rM180 and the mutants denature to an aggregated state. To further understand the thermal behavior, all three proteins were subjected to multiple heating/cooling cycles and monitored as before (supplemental Fig. S3). For rM180, the CD intensity patterns derived from various cycles could be superimposed. However, both mutants showed considerable lag after the 1st heating cycle (supplemental Fig. S3). The presence of a hysteresis during thermal denaturation implies that unfolding/refolding takes a different path and varies for the two mutants compared with WT rM180. For example, during refolding hardly any original conformation was detectable at 37 °C for the two mutants, whereas rM180 reaches the original conformation below 42 °C. Therefore, to assess the influence of mutations on the refolding ability, the proteins were completely denatured by heating to 70 °C and cooled rapidly to 25 °C. The change in ellipticity values at 200 nm was monitored over time. Fig. 2D shows the kinetics of refolding for WT and the mutant proteins. For all the proteins, a large change in signal occurred within the first few seconds. This burst phase was accompanied by a slower observable phase. F"

https://openalex.org/W2083583008,"Reverse gyrase reanneals denatured DNA and induces positive supercoils in DNA, an activity that is critical for life at very high temperatures. Positive supercoiling occurs by a poorly understood mechanism involving the coordination of a topoisomerase domain and a helicase-like domain. In the parasitic archaeon Nanoarchaeum equitans, these domains occur as separate subunits. We express the subunits, and characterize them both in isolation and as a heterodimer. Each subunit tightly associates and interacts with the other. The topoisomerase subunit enhances the catalytic specificity of the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the helicase-like subunit, and the helicase-like subunit inhibits the relaxation activity of the topoisomerase subunit while promoting positive supercoiling. DNA binding preference for both single- and double-stranded DNA is partitioned between the subunits. Based on a sensitive topological shift assay, the binding preference of helicase-like subunit for underwound DNA is modulated by its binding with ATP cofactor. These results provide new insight into the mechanism of positive supercoil induction by reverse gyrase."
https://openalex.org/W2105032548,"Podosomes are highly dynamic structures that are involved in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling. They present as intracellular columns composed of an actin-rich core region and a surrounding ring-like structure containing focal adhesion proteins, actin binders as well as cell signaling molecules. A key player in podosome biogenesis is the scaffolding protein cortactin, which is thought to control actin assembly at the core region. We show that the zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1), a pivotal tight junction protein and known binding partner of cortactin, is a component of podosomes. In the smooth muscle cell line A7r5, phorbol ester treatment induced a rapid relocation of ZO-1 from the cell cortex and cytosolic pools toward newly formed podosomes. Podosomal localization was also observed for the known ZO-1-binding proteins l-afadin, α-catenin, and phospho-connexin 43. Truncation studies revealed that the actin-binding domain but not the association with cortactin is necessary for ZO-1 recruitment to podosomes. Moreover, impaired ZO-1 expression leads to significantly reduced podosome formation and concomitant decreased matrix degradation at podosomes. Our findings demonstrate that besides their known function in tight junction assembly and intercellular communication, zona occludens proteins and their binding partners may play a novel role in podosome formation and associated function, thus regulating cell adhesion and matrix remodeling."

Using the Rosetta alanine-scanning and design algorithms to predict destabilizing, stabilizing, and neutral mutations in the β3 region extending from residues Lys532 through Gly690, we predicted eight alanine mutations that would destabilize the αIIbβ3 interface as well as nine predicted to destabilize the αvβ3 interface, by at least 0.3 kcal/mol. The mutations were widely and unevenly distributed, with four between residues 552 and 563 and five between 590 and 610, but none between 565 and 589, and 611 and 655. Further, mutations destabilizing the αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 interfaces were not identical. The predictions were then tested by introducing selected mutations into the full-length integrins expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Five mutations predicted to destabilize αIIb and β3 caused fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3, whereas three of four predicted to be neutral or stabilizing did not. Conversely, a mutation predicted to destabilize αvβ3, but not αIIbβ3 (D552A), caused osteopontin binding to αvβ3, but not fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3.

https://openalex.org/W2108399540,"MscL is a bacterial mechanosensor that serves as a biological emergency release valve, releasing cytoplasmic solutes to the environment on osmotic downshock. Previous studies have recognized that this channel has properties that make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve for vesicular-based targeted drug-release devices. One can even change the modality of the sensor. Briefly, the introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen gates the channel in the absence of membrane tension; thus, by inserting compounds that acquire a charge on exposure to an alternative stimulus, such as light or pH, into the pore of the channel, controllable nanoswitches that detect these alternative modalities have been engineered. However, a charge in the pore lumen could not only encourage actuation of the nanopore but also have a significant influence on the permeation of large charged compounds, which would thus have important implications for the efficiency of drug-release devices. In this study, we used in vivo and electrophysiological approaches to demonstrate that the introduction of a charge into pore lumen of MscL does indeed influence the permeation of charged molecules. These effects were more drastic for larger compounds and, surprisingly, were related to the orientation of the MscL channel in the membrane."

They told us that immunology and its underlying concepts were perceived to be complex and arcane and that there was a need for immunology to be better integrated into “real-life” clinical practice. Most saw immunology as predominantly a laboratory science with little application to clinical practice; this highlighted a gap between clinical management of patients and theoretical understanding of the etiology and immunopathogenesis of disease. We speculated that one of the possible reasons for this perception and knowledge gap is that immunology is not an independent discipline within the South African medical curriculum. Instead, it is diffusely integrated into disciplines such as pathology or internal medicine and is not specifically provided for during post-degree training."
