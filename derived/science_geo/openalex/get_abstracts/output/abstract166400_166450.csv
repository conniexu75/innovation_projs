https://openalex.org/W2128882718,"Double-stranded RNA induces potent and specific gene silencing through a process referred to as RNA interference (RNAi) or posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS). RNAi is mediated by RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), a sequence-specific, multicomponent nuclease that destroys messenger RNAs homologous to the silencing trigger. RISC is known to contain short RNAs ( approximately 22 nucleotides) derived from the double-stranded RNA trigger, but the protein components of this activity are unknown. Here, we report the biochemical purification of the RNAi effector nuclease from cultured Drosophila cells. The active fraction contains a ribonucleoprotein complex of approximately 500 kilodaltons. Protein microsequencing reveals that one constituent of this complex is a member of the Argonaute family of proteins, which are essential for gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans, Neurospora, and Arabidopsis. This observation begins the process of forging links between genetic analysis of RNAi from diverse organisms and the biochemical model of RNAi that is emerging from Drosophila in vitro systems."
https://openalex.org/W2067501282,"The temporal resolution of neuronal integration depends on the time window within which excitatory inputs summate to reach the threshold for spike generation. Here, we show that in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells this window is very narrow (less than 2 milliseconds). This narrowness results from the short delay with which disynaptic feed-forward inhibition follows monosynaptic excitation. Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings indicate that feed-forward inhibition is much stronger in the soma than in the dendrites, resulting in a broader integration window in the latter compartment. Thus, the subcellular partitioning of feed-forward inhibition enforces precise coincidence detection in the soma, while allowing dendrites to sum incoming activity over broader time windows."

However, the time when colonization occurred remains speculative. The first fossil land plants and fungi appeared 480 to 460 million years ago (Ma), whereas molecular clock estimates suggest an earlier colonization of land, about 600 Ma. Our protein sequence analyses indicate that green algae and major lineages of fungi were present 1000 Ma and that land plants appeared by 700 Ma, possibly affecting Earth's atmosphere, climate, and evolution of animals in the Precambrian."

Little is known, however, about the mechanism underlying the placebo effect. Using the ability of endogenous dopamine to compete for [ 11 C]raclopride binding as measured by positron emission tomography, we provide in vivo evidence for substantial release of endogenous dopamine in the striatum of PD patients in response to placebo. Our findings indicate that the placebo effect in PD is powerful and is mediated through activation of the damaged nigrostriatal dopamine system."
https://openalex.org/W2096387523,"We present the crystal structure at 2.7 angstrom resolution of the human antibody IgG1 b12. Antibody b12 recognizes the CD4-binding site of human immunodeficiency virus–1 (HIV-1) gp120 and is one of only two known antibodies against gp120 capable of broad and potent neutralization of primary HIV-1 isolates. A key feature of the antibody-combining site is the protruding, finger-like long CDR H3 that can penetrate the recessed CD4-binding site of gp120. A docking model of b12 and gp120 reveals severe structural constraints that explain the extraordinary challenge in eliciting effective neutralizing antibodies similar to b12. The structure, together with mutagenesis studies, provides a rationale for the extensive cross-reactivity of b12 and a valuable framework for the design of HIV-1 vaccines capable of eliciting b12-like activity."
https://openalex.org/W2067487392,"Eukaryotic genomes are organized into discrete structural and functional chromatin domains. Here, we show that distinct site-specific histone H3 methylation patterns define euchromatic and heterochromatic chromosomal domains within a 47-kilobase region of the mating-type locus in fission yeast. H3 methylated at lysine 9 (H3 Lys 9 ), and its interacting Swi6 protein, are strictly localized to a 20-kilobase silent heterochromatic interval. In contrast, H3 methylated at lysine 4 (H3 Lys 4 ) is specific to the surrounding euchromatic regions. Two inverted repeats flanking the silent interval serve as boundary elements to mark the borders between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Deletions of these boundary elements lead to spreading of H3 Lys 9 methylation and Swi6 into neighboring sequences. Furthermore, the H3 Lys 9 methylation and corresponding heterochromatin-associated complexes prevent H3 Lys 4 methylation in the silent domain."

https://openalex.org/W2024964682,"Sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) have potent anti-inflammatory properties. We have shown previously that they exert this effect in part by inhibiting activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, a central regulator of the immune response. We have proposed a molecular mechanism for this inhibition based on computer molecular modeling data. In this model, SLs directly alkylate the p65 subunit of NF-κB, thereby inhibiting DNA binding. Nevertheless, an experimental evidence for the proposed mechanism was lacking. Moreover, based on experiments using the SL parthenolide, an alternative mode of action has been proposed by other authors in which SLs inhibit IκB-α degradation. Here we report the construction of p65/NF-κB point mutants that lack the cysteine residues alkylated by SLs in our model. In contrast to wild type p65, DNA-binding of the Cys38 → Ser and Cys38,120 → Ser mutants is no longer inhibited by SLs. In addition, we provide evidence that parthenolide uses a similar mechanism to other SLs in inhibiting NF-κB. Contrary to previous reports, we show that parthenolide, like other SLs, inhibits NF-κB most probably by alkylating p65 at Cys38. Although a slight inhibition of IκB degradation was detected for all SLs, the amount of remaining IκB was too low to explain the observed NF-κB inhibition.

Both the nature of the NF-κB inducers and the function of its target genes highlight its role, as a central mediator of the human immune response. NF-κB is most frequently composed of a p50 and a p65 subunit retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form by binding to IκB, an inhibitory subunit. Inducers of NF-κB, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS)1 or inflammatory cytokines, activate the IκB kinase complex (IKC), which phosphorylates IκB on serines 32 and 36. Phosphorylation causes IκB ubiquitinylation and its subsequent degradation by the 26-S proteasome. Degradation of the inhibitor allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, where it stimulates transcription of its target genes. 2Rothwarf, D. M. and Karin, M. (1999) www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/oc_sigtrans;1999/5/rel. Genes that are regulated by NF-κB include, for example, proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1, -2, -4, and -6 or TNF-α, as well as genes encoding immunoreceptors, cell adhesion molecules, acute phase proteins, and enzymes such as cyclooxygenase-II. Because of its central role in regulating inflammatory responses, a pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB activation could be beneficial in the treatment of inflammation (4Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4300) Google Scholar).2 Sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) are the active constituents of many medicinal plants from the Asteraceae family. These herbal remedies are used for the treatment of inflammation in traditional medicine. It has been shown in various assays that plant extracts as well as the purified SLs possess anti-inflammatory properties. We have recently demonstrated that several SLs inhibit activation of NF-κB (5Lyss G. Knorre A. Schmidt T.J. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 7: 2343-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Using helenalin as a model, we have shown that SLs inhibit neither IκB degradation nor NF-κB nuclear translocation. SLs interact directly with NF-κB. DNA binding of NF-κB is prevented by selectively alkylating cysteine sulfhydryl groups in its p65 subunit (5Lyss G. Knorre A. Schmidt T.J. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33508-33516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 6Lyss G. Schmidt T.J. Merfort I. Pahl H.L. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). There are strong indications that this is a general mechanism for SLs, which possess α,β- or α,β,γ-unsaturated carbonyl structures such as α-methylene-γ-lactones or α,β-unsubstituted cyclopentenones. These functional groups are known to react with nucleophiles, especially with cysteine sulfhydryl groups, in a Michael-type addition (9Schmidt T.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Dupuis G. Mitchell J.C. Towers G.H.N. Can. J. Biochem. 1974; 52: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Picman A.K.

Studies on structure-activity relationships revealed that a strong NF-κB-inhibitory activity correlates with the presence of two reactive centers in the SL molecule. Thus, bifunctional SLs inhibit NF-κB DNA binding at a concentration 10 times lower than monofunctional molecules (8Rüngeler P. Castro V. Mora G. Gören N. Vichnewski W. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. Schmidt T.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2343-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Based on the published x-ray structure of the p65 homodimer, we have proposed a mechanism for NF-κB inhibition by SLs (8Rüngeler P. Castro V. Mora G. Gören N. Vichnewski W. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. Schmidt T.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2343-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 12Chen Y.-Q. Ghosh S. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In our model, bifunctional SLs react with two cysteine residues in the p65 molecule (Cys38 and Cys120), thereby preventing DNA binding of the transcription factor. This model can explain both the selectivity of SLs for p65 and the observed requirement of bifunctionality for an effective inhibition (8Rüngeler P. Castro V. Mora G. Gören N. Vichnewski W. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. Schmidt T.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2343-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In NF-κB/p65, cysteine L1 (L1-Cys, position 38) participates in DNA binding by forming a hydrogen bond with the sugar/ phosphate backbone of the κB-DNA motif. Several amino acids in its immediate vicinity (Arg33, Arg35, Tyr36, Glu39, and Arg187) are also known to be essential for DNA recognition and binding. A second cysteine (E′-Cys, position 120) in the nearby E′ region, is found at a distance of only 8 Å from the L1-Cys. We have proposed that this distance is small enough to allow the alkylation of both sulfur atoms by a single bifunctional SL. The alkylation of both amino acids would result in a cross-link between Cys38 and Cys120 in the p65 molecule. Between these two amino acids there is a gap that is empty except for the phenol ring of Tyr36; its interaction with the DNA backbone and with two thymine residues is essential for the DNA binding. If p65 were alkylated at both cysteine residues by a SL, the Tyr36/DNA interaction would become impossible. The spatial arrangement of Tyr36 is crucial for the binding activity. Hence, an alteration of the geometry in this region would dramatically affect the capability of p65 to bind to the κB-DNA motif. Molecular modeling predicts that upon alkylation of both amino acids, dramatic changes in the positions of the Tyr36 will occur. Moreover, after reacting with the protein, the SL occupies a space otherwise filled by the DNA sugar/phosphate backbone. Molecular models thus predict that alkylation would alter the p65 structure so as to make DNA binding impossible. The same model suggests that alkylation of p65 by two monofunctional SL molecules prevents its DNA binding (8Rüngeler P. Castro V. Mora G. Gören N. Vichnewski W. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. Schmidt T.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2343-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To date, we have not been able to present direct chemical proof for our proposed mechanism. In this paper we use point mutants to demonstrate that cysteine 38 is the key amino acid in SL-mediated NF-κB inhibition. Moreover, our studies show that parthenolide acts like helenalin in that it also selectively alkylates NF-κB/p65 on cysteine residues. Although we also observed a slight inhibition of IκB-α degradation with parthenolide as well as the other SLs tested, the amount of remaining IκB-α was too low to explain the observed NF-κB inhibition. These data contradict a previous report suggesting that parthenolide exerts its effect on NF-κB solely by inhibiting IκB-α degradation (13Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5617-5623PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hehner S.P. Heinrich M. Bork P.M. Vogt M. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Schulze-Osthoff K. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol.

Our observation that SLs directly inhibit NF-κB DNA binding reemphasizes their potential as very interesting lead compounds for the design of new anti-inflammatory drugs. Helenalin and 11α-13-dihydrohelenalin acetate were isolated from flower heads of Arnica chamissonis ssp. foliosa as described previously (15Willuhn G. Kresken J. Leven W. Planta Med. 1990; 56: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and parthenolide was purchased from Sigma. 4β,15-Epoxy-miller-9E-enolide was isolated from the leaves of Milleria quinqueflora (16Castro V.

The mammalian expression vectors containing cDNAs for the NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 have been described previously in detail (18Kieran M. Blank V. Logeat F. Vandekerckhove J. Lottspeich F.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Two separate PCR reactions were carried out using the p65 cDNA as a template. The following primers were used to construct the mutant proteins: cysteine 38 to serine (Cys38 → Ser), sense, 5′-CCGCTACAAGTCCGAGGGGCGCTCCGCGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCGCGGAGCGCCCCTCGGACTTGTAGCGG-3′; cysteine 120 to serine (Cys120 → Ser), sense, 5′-CCTGGGAATTCAGTCTGTGAAGAAGCGGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCCGCTTCTTCACAGACTGAATTCCCAGG-3′; cysteine 120 to glycine (Cys120 → Gly), sense, 5′-CCTGGGAATT CAGGGTGTGAAGAAGCGGG-3′, and antisense, 5′- CCCGCTTCTTCACACCCTGAATTCCCAGG-3′; cysteine 120 to alanine (Cys120 → Ala), sense, 5′-CCTGGGAATTCAGGCTGTGAAGAAGCGGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCCGCTTCTTCACAGCCTGAATTCCCAGG-3′. The mutated nucleotides are in bold type and underlined. In the Cys120 → Xaa mutants, an additional mutation was introduced to generate a new EcoRI restriction site. This mutation was used to confirm the presence of the mutation after cloning. The mutant p65 fragments were combined using PCR-ligation; a PCR reaction using only the two fragments but no primers was performed. The resulting full-length mutated DNA was amplified using T7 and SP6 primers. All PCR reactions were conducted with recombinantPfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene), which has proof-reading activity, to minimize the random generation of unwanted mutations. The mutated p65 cDNA was cloned into pRC/CMV (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations and to rule out the appearance of unwanted mutations. Altogether, five plasmids were constructed, in which cysteines 38, 120, or both amino acids were replaced by serine (both single mutants and the double mutant), glycine (cysteine 120), or alanine (cysteine 120). Jurkat T-cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 293 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Both were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum,100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma, and TNF-α was a kind gift from Dr. K. Decker, Freiburg, Germany. 293 Cells were plated 12–16 h prior to transfection at a density of 2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish. Cells were transfected using the SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. Total cell extracts from Jurkat T-cells were prepared using a high-salt detergent buffer (Totex; 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 350 mmNaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma), and resuspended in 4 cell volumes of Totex buffer. The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatant was determined, and equal amounts of protein (10–20 µg) were added to a reaction mixture containing 20 µg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 2 µg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2 µl of buffer D+ (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 4 µl of buffer F (20% Ficoll 400, 100 mmHepes, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 100,000 cpm (Cerenkov) of a32 P-labeled oligonucleotide made up to a final volume of 20 µl with distilled water. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 25 min. NF-κB oligonucleotide (Promega) was labeled using [γ32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Total cell extracts (30 µg) were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred at 0.8 mA/cm2for 1 h onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Owl). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by immersing the membrane in blocking solution (TBST: 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v), containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Fluka)) overnight at 4 °C. After a short wash in TBST, the membrane was incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit anti-IκB-α antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) in TBST for 1 h at room temperature followed by 30 min of washing with TBST. Bound antibody was decorated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; diluted 1:2000 in TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing for 30 min in TBST, the immunocomplexes were detected using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Exposure to Kodak XAR-5 films was performed for 10 s to 2 min. To determine IKK activity, total Jurkat T-cell extracts were prepared using 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmNa3 VO4, 50 mm NaF). 1000 µg of protein extract was immunoprecipitated by incubating overnight at 4 °C with agarose-conjugated IKK-α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and mixing on a spinning wheel. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. The kinase assay was performed with full-length IκB-α (amino acids 1–317, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) protein in 20 µl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm ATP, and 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP). A portion of the immunoprecipitated IKK complex was incubated in the kinase buffer with 4 µg of the substrate for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The remaining portion of the immunoprecipitated samples were run on a separate 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were Western-blotted with an IKK-β antibody to check for equality of loading. To demonstrate directly that SLs alkylate the p65 NF-κB subunit, we constructed expression plasmids that encode p65 proteins in which either one cysteine (Cys38 → Ser, Cys120 → Ser) or both cysteine residues (Cys38,120 → Ser) were mutated to serine. By mutating cysteine to serine, a thiol functional group is replaced by an alcohol, which can no longer react with SLs. These plasmids were used to transiently transfect 293 cells. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for NF-κB DNA binding by EMSA. With the exception of the Cys120 → Ser mutant, all mutant p65 proteins bound to DNA (Fig. 2B, lane 2, and Fig.2 D, lane 2). To obtain a functional cysteine 120 mutant, a Cys120 → Gly and Cys120 → Ala mutant were constructed. These amino acids are incapable of reacting with the SLs. Of these mutants, only the Cys120 → Ala mutant showed DNA binding activity. Each p65 mutant bound DNA with different affinity, the Cys38 → Ser showed the strongest binding followed by the Cys38,120 → Ser mutant and the native protein, whereas the Cys120 → Ala mutant bound DNA with least affinity. Transfected cells expressing either wild type (wt) or mutant proteins were incubated with increasing concentrations of different SLs, and their DNA binding was assessed by an EMSA. The advantage of using transfected cells overexpressing p65 is that no stimulation is needed to observe a DNA binding activity. As the p65 concentration in these cells exceeds that of IκB, the p65 homodimer is not inactivated and binds DNA with no need for NF-κB activation. Therefore, using p65 transfected cells, the effect of direct interactions between this NF-κB subunit and SLs on DNA binding can be studied. We assessed three bifunctional SLs, 4β,15-epoxy-miller-9E-enolide, helenalin, and parthenolide, as well as the monofunctional 11α,13-dihydrohelenalin acetate (for structures see Fig. 1) for their effect on p65 DNA binding. We have previously shown that all four compounds inhibit DNA binding of NF-κB at micromolar concentrations, the bifunctional SLs being the strongest inhibitors. For the latter, concentrations between 5 and 20 µm are needed for a complete NF-κB inhibition (8Rüngeler P. Castro V. Mora G. Gören N. Vichnewski W. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. Schmidt T.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2343-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), whereas 200 µm 11α,13-dihydrohelenalin acetate are required for the same effect. 3C. A. Klaas, G. Wagner, S. Sosa, R. Della Loggia, U. Bonne, H. L. Pahl, and I. Merfort, unpublished results. If SLs inhibit NF-κB according to the mechanism proposed by us, concentrations that completely inhibit wt p65 should not affect the mutant proteins. Therefore, we first determined those concentrations that completely inhibit the DNA binding of the p65 homodimer (Figs.2 A and 3A, TableI). These were nearly identical to those required for complete inhibition of heterodimeric NF-κB (p50/p65), and only 11α,13-dihydrohelenalin acetate required a lower dose (100versus 200 µm) to inhibit p65 homodimer DNA binding.Table IConcentrations (µm) of the SLs that induced complete, slight (s.i.), or no (n.i.) inhibition of the mutants or the wild type p65/NF-κB in an EMSAHelenalin11α,13-Dihydrohelenalin acetateParthenolide4β,15-Epoxy-miller-9E-enolidewt p65/NF-κB101002010Cys38 → Ser10 (n.i.)300 (n.i.)40 (n.i.)20 (n.i.)20 (s.i.)Cys120 → Ala105053Cys38,120 → Ser10 (n.i.)100 (n.i.)20 (n.i.)20 (almost complete)20 (s.i.)200 (s.i.)30 (n.i.) Open table in a new tab In contrast to wt p65, DNA binding of the Cys38 → Ser single mutant was no longer inhibited by any SL (Figs.2 B, and 3 B, lanes 8–13, and Table I). However, the Cys120 → Ala mutant was inhibited at lower concentrations than wt p65 (Figs.2 C and 3 A, lanes 2–7). It thus appears that Cys120, which was available for alkylation in the Cys38 → Ser mutant, is not critical for the effect of SLs on p65 DNA binding. Cys38, by contrast, appears critical for the ability of all SLs to inhibit p65 DNA binding, because its mutation rendered p65 insensitive to SL interference. Mutation of Cys120 to alanine appears to destabilize the p65 structure, because the mutant binds DNA more weakly than wt p65 (compare Fig. 2,C, lane 2, with A, lane 2). It is thus dislodged from the DNA at lower SL concentrations than wt p65 (Figs. 2,A and B, and 3 A). This conformational instability may also explain why the Cys38,120 → Ser double mutant is more sensitive to SL modification than the Cys38 → Ser single mutant at higher SL concentrations (compare Fig. 2 D with Figs. 2 B and3 B). Thus, Cys120 appears to be targeted by SLs as well, even though Cys38 is the major site of alkylation. Parthenolide shows the same behavior as the bifunctional SLs helenalin and 4β,15-epoxy-miller-9E-enolide with respect to inhibition of transfected p65 proteins (Table I, Fig. 3). No difference can be observed between the inhibition of p65 mutants or the native protein by parthenolide compared with the other SLs studied. These data suggest that this SL interacts with and directly alkylates the p65 subunit of NF-κB as do other SLs. However, these data contradict observations by Hehner et al. (13Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5617-5623PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hehner S.P. Heinrich M. Bork P.M. Vogt M. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Schulze-Osthoff K. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1288-1297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), which excluded a direct reaction with NF-κB. These authors presented evidence that NF-κB inhibition by parthenolide is due solely to the prevention of IκB degradation. To obtain further evidence for the direct alkylation of NF-κB by parthenolide, Jurkat T-cells were first stimulated with TNF-α for 20 min and then incubated with 20 µm parthenolide for the indicated times. Subsequently, cell extracts were analyzed for NF-κB DNA binding by EMSA. Fig. 4shows that parthenolide inhibits NF-κ B DNA binding after the transcription factor has been activated. If parthenolide inhibited the activation of NF-κB solely by preventing degradation of IκB, it should not interfere with DNA binding once the transcription factor has been activated and IκB is degraded. Thus, parthenolide displays the same properties reported for helenalin and germacranolides fromTithonia diversifolia (5Lyss G. Knorre A. Schmidt T.J. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33508-33516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 7Rüngeler P. Lyss G. Castro V. Mora G. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. Planta Med. 1998; 64: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Further proof for the direct alkylation of NF-κB was obtained by incubating Jurkat T-cells with parthenolide and then stimulating with TNF-α for different time periods. No NF-κB DNA binding could be detected by EMSA in these extracts (data not shown). The protein extracts were then treated with DOC, which can release IκB from the NF-κB·IκB complex (21Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) (Fig.5). If parthenolide inhibits NF-κB by preventing IκB degradation, de novo NF-κB DNA binding should be observed after treatment with DOC. This is observed after quercetin treatment, which does not alkylate NF-κB and was hence used as a control. This flavonoid inhibits NF-κB activation by inhibiting IKK-α and -β, thereby preventing IκB degradation (22Tsai S.-H. Liang Y.-C. Lin-Shiau S.-Y. Lin J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Peet G.W. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32655-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Protein extracts treated with an inhibiting concentration of quercetin displayed NF-κB DNA binding after DOC treatment (Fig. 5, lane 6). However, following parthenolide treatment, NF-κB DNA binding could not be restored by DOC treatment (Fig. 5, lanes 7–10). To exclude the possibility that parthenolide targets the p50 subunit of NF-κB, we investigated its effect on the p50 homodimer. We transfected 293 cells with an expression vector for the p50 DNA-binding subunit of NF-κB. Overexpressed p50 is not subjected to IκB inactivation and will therefore constitutively bind DNA as a homodimer (24Urban M.B. Baeuerle P.A. New. Biol. 1991; 3: 279-288PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected 293 cells expressing p50 NF-κB were treated with increasing concentrations of parthenolide for 2 h after which cells were analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 6). Concentrations of up to 40 µm parthenolide did not impair NF-κB p50 DNA binding activity (Fig. 6, lane 7). These data demonstrate that parthenolide has no effect on DNA binding of the NF-κB p50 subunit. The same results were obtained with 4β,15-epoxy-miller-9E-enolide (data not shown) and helenalin (6Lyss G. Schmidt T.J. Merfort I. Pahl H.L. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), suggesting that SLs in general do not target the p50 subunit. Taken together, these three experiments clearly confirm that parthenolide directly alkylates NF-κB. Furthermore, a lack of NF-κB DNA binding following DOC treatment suggests that alkylation rather than any interference with its activation is the major mechanism of NF-κB inhibition by SLs. Although data presented so far demonstrate direct alkylation of p65 by parthenolide, these experiments did not investigate whether this SL also inhibits IκB degradation. Therefore, we repeated the experiments published by Hehner et al. (14Hehner S.P. Heinrich M. Bork P.M. Vogt M. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Schulze-Osthoff K. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1288-1297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The protein extracts shown in Fig.7A were analyzed in a Western blot using a polyclonal antibody against IκB-α. Fig. 7 B(lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9) shows that TNF-α treatment for various times resulted in decreased amounts of detectable IκB-α compared with unstimulated cells. However, this decrease occurred more slowly in the presence of parthenolide than in its absence (compare lane 2 and 3, Fig.7 B). The same experiment was repeated with helenalin and 4β,15-epoxy-miller-9E-enolide to exclude the possibility that this effect is a specific property for parthenolide. In all cases a decrease in the amount of IκB-α could be observed (data not shown). We have previously reported a similar retardation of IκB-α degradation in the presence of helenalin (6Lyss G. Schmidt T.J. Merfort I. Pahl H.L. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). De novo IκB-α synthesis was observed 30 min after TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 7 B, lane 4) (25Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Krönke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). After 60 min the IκB-α concentration was as high as in untreated cells (Fig. 7 B, lane 6). It is therefore difficult to decide whether the IκB-α band observed in parthenolide-treated cells (lanes 5 and 7) was due to an inhibition of its degradation or to de novo synthesis of IκB-α. For this reason, we repeated the experiment shown in Fig. 7 but in addition incubated the cells with cycloheximide to inhibit IκB-α resynthesis (Fig. 8) (26Li X. Fang Y. Zhao X. Jiang X. Duong T.

Previous work suggested a link between acetylation and phosphorylation, but questioned its mechanistic basis. We have purified a histone H3 serine-10 kinase complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have identified its catalytic subunit as Snf1. The Snf1/AMPK family of kinases function in conserved signal transduction pathways. Our results show that Snf1 and the acetyltransferase Gcn5 function in an obligate sequence to enhance INO1 transcription by modifying histone H3 serine-10 and lysine-14. Thus, phosphorylation and acetylation are targeted to the same histone by promoter-specific regulation by a kinase/acetyltransferase pair, supporting models of gene regulation wherein transcription is controlled by coordinated patterns of histone modification."

However, the mechanism by which mts1(S100A4) promoted metastasis had not been identified. Here we demonstrated that Mts1(S100A4) had significant stimulatory effect on the angiogenesis. We detected high incidence of hemangiomas--benign tumors of vascular origin in aged transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing the mts1(S100A4) gene. Furthermore, the serum level of the Mts1(S100A4) protein increased with ageing. Tumors developed in Mts1-transgenic mice revealed an enhanced vascular density. We showed that an oligomeric, but not a dimeric form of the Mts1(S100A4) protein was capable of enhancing the endothelial cell motility in vitro and stimulate the corneal neovascularization in vivo. An oligomeric fraction of the protein was detected in the conditioned media as well as in human serum. The data obtained allowed us to conclude that mts1(S100A4) might induce tumor progression via stimulation of angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2080442977,"In yeast, ubiquitin plays a central role in proteolysis of a multitude of proteins and serves also as a signal for endocytosis of many plasma membrane proteins. We showed previously that ubiquitination of the general amino acid permease (Gap1) is essential to its endocytosis followed by vacuolar degradation. These processes occur when NH4+, a preferential source of nitrogen, is added to cells growing on proline or urea,i.e. less favored nitrogen sources. In this study, we show that Gap1 is ubiquitinated on two lysine residues in the cytosolic N terminus (positions 9 and 16). A mutant Gap1 in which both lysines are mutated (Gap1K9K16) remains fully stable at the plasma membrane after NH4+ addition. Furthermore, each of the two lysines harbors a poly-ubiquitin chain in which ubiquitin is linked to the lysine 63 of the preceding ubiquitin. The Gap1K9 and Gap1K16 mutants, in which a single lysine is mutated, are down-regulated in response to NH4+ although more slowly. In proline-grown cells lacking Npr1, a protein kinase involved in the control of Gap1 trafficking, newly synthesized Gap1 is sorted from the Golgi to the vacuole without passing through the plasma membrane (accompanying article, De Craene, J.-O., Soetens, O., and André, B. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 43939–43948). We show here that ubiquitination of Gap1 is also required for this direct sorting to the vacuole. In an npr1Δ mutant, neosynthesized Gap1K9K16 is rerouted to and accumulates at the plasma membrane. Finally, Bul1 and Bul2, two proteins interacting with Npi1/Rsp5, are essential to ubiquitination and down-regulation of cell-surface Gap1, as well as to sorting of neosynthesized Gap1 to the vacuole, as occurs in an npr1Δ mutant. Our results reveal a novel role of ubiquitin in the control of Gap1 trafficking,i.e. direct sorting from the late secretory pathway to the vacuole. This result reinforces the growing evidence that ubiquitin plays an important role not only in internalization of plasma membrane proteins but also in their sorting in the endosomes and/or trans-Golgi.

Although ubiquitination generally serves as a recognition signal for degradation by the proteasome (1Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev.

Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), studies in yeast have shown that ubiquitination of plasma membrane proteins results in their endocytosis followed by vacuolar degradation (3Hicke L.

Ubiquitination of most of these proteins has been shown to involve the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) encoded by the UBC1–4 genes and an HECT-type ubiquitin ligase (E3) encoded by the essential NPI1/RSP5 gene (14Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitin has been shown to contain an endocytosis signal in the form of two surface patches surrounding two critical residues (Phe4 and Ile44) (15Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, the protein components of the endocytosis machinery involved in ubiquitin recognition remain unknown. It also remains undetermined as to whether ubiquitin also plays a role in the late steps of endocytosis and whether plasma membrane proteins undergo successive cycles of ubiquitination-de-ubiquitination during transit to the vacuole. Here we have investigated the role of ubiquitin in the internal trafficking of the general amino acid permease (Gap1),1 which is tightly regulated by nitrogen. On proline or urea medium, i.e.conditions of poor nitrogen supply, the GAP1 gene is transcribed to high levels (16Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and the synthesized Gap1 permease accumulates at the plasma membrane in an active and stable form (17Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,18De Craene J.-O. Soetens O. André B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43939-43948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of NH4+ (a preferential source of nitrogen), Gap1 is internalized by endocytosis and targeted to the vacuole for degradation. Ubiquitination of Gap1 is essential to this NH4+-induced down-regulation (9Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 10Springael J.Y. Andre B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the npi1 mutant, which displays an abnormally low level of the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase Npi1/Rsp5, or the npi2 mutant lacking the Npi2/Doa4 de-ubiquitinating enzyme, Gap1 is not ubiquitinated and stays at the plasma membrane after NH4+ addition (10Springael J.Y. Andre B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar,19Springael J.Y. Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, as shown for the uracil permease Fur4 (8Galan J. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), Gap1 is poly-ubiquitinated, the ubiquitin moieties being attached to the lysine 63 of the preceding ubiquitin (19Springael J.Y. Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (henceforth called the lysine 63-linked poly-ubiquitin chain). Gap1 poly-ubiquitination is required for down-regulation of the permease at a maximal rate (19Springael J.Y. Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fate of newly synthesized Gap1 in the late secretory pathway is also under nitrogen control. On proline or urea medium, neosynthesized Gap1 is delivered to the plasma membrane, but in a medium containing glutamate (20Roberg K.J. Rowley N. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) or NH4+ (18De Craene J.-O. Soetens O. André B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43939-43948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as the sole nitrogen source, Gap1 is directly sorted from the Golgi to the vacuole without passing via the cell surface. A similar situation has been observed on proline medium with cells lacking Npr1, a protein kinase controlling both cell-surface and internal Gap1 (18De Craene J.-O. Soetens O. André B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43939-43948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and apparently inactivated by phosphorylation when good nitrogen sources are available (21Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that Gap1 is ubiquitinated on two lysine residues in its extreme N terminus, at positions 9 and 16. Using the Gap1K9K16 variant in which both lysine residues are mutated, we show that ubiquitination of Gap1 is required not only for down-regulation of the protein pre-accumulated at the cell surface but also for direct sorting of the protein from the late secretory pathway to the vacuole, as occurs in an npr1Δ mutant. We further show that ubiquitination and degradation of both cell-surface and internal Gap1 requires Bul1 and Bul2, two proteins interacting with the Npi1/Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase. As this paper was being reviewed, it was reported by others (22Helliwell S.B. Losko S. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 649-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) that sorting of Gap1 to the vacuole requires its poly-ubiquitination and that the specific role of Bul1 and Bul2 is to specify this modification (see “Discussion”). All Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study (see Table I) are isogenic with Σ1278b (23Béchet J. Grenson M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in minimal buffered medium (24Jacobs P. Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with 3% glucose as the carbon source except when mentioned otherwise. In steady-state experiments, proline (10 mm) was the sole nitrogen source. In experiments of Gap1 neosynthesis, cells were grown exponentially on glutamine (5 mm) or NH4+ (100 mm) and transferred to proline medium to relieve GAP1 repression. In ubiquitin overexpression experiments, cells were grown on glutamine medium and transferred to preheated YNB (yeast nitrogen base without NH4+ or amino acids; Difco) medium containing 10 mm proline, 3% glucose, and 0.1 mmCuSO4 to induce expression of ubiquitin. The 2 μ-based multi-copy plasmid YEp96 contains a synthetic yeast ubiquitine gene under the control of the copper-inducible CUP1 promoter (25Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc.

The plasmids encoding the ubiquitin in which lysine residue 63 (UbK63R), or lysine residues 29, 48, and 63 (UbRRR) are replaced by arginine are derived from YEp96 (26Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To avoid competitive inhibition of citrulline transport by glutamine, cells grown on glutamine medium were filtered, washed, and transferred to preheated proline medium just before the transport assay. The permease was inactivated by adding preheated (NH4)2SO4 to the culture (final concentration, 10 mm). Crude cell extracts (9Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and membrane-enriched preparations were prepared as previously described (10Springael J.Y. Andre B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In Western blot experiments, protein concentrations were estimated by densitometry of the Pma1 signal (ImageMaster1D,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal quantities of protein were loaded on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in a Tricine system (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schüll), the proteins were probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against Gap1 (1: 10 000) or Pma1 (1: 1 000). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The bul1Δ, bul2Δ, and npr1Δ null mutations were constructed by the polymerase chain reaction-based gene deletion method (31Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P.

In wild-type cells grown on a medium containing urea or proline as sole nitrogen source, newly synthesized Gap1 is sorted from the Golgi to the plasma membrane where it accumulates in an active and stable form. In contrast, in mutant cells lacking the Npr1 kinase, neosynthesized Gap1 is sorted from the Golgi to the vacuole without passing via the plasma membrane (18De Craene J.-O. Soetens O. André B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43939-43948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This direct sorting of Gap1 to the vacuole also occurs when wild-type cells are grown on a medium containing either glutamate (20Roberg K.J. Rowley N. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) or NH4+ (18De Craene J.-O. Soetens O. André B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43939-43948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as sole nitrogen source, this being consistent with Npr1 being inactive under these favorable nitrogen supply conditions (35Schmidt A. Beck T. Koller A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6924-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It was previously reported that loss of Gap1 activity in npr1 mutants is suppressed by the npi1 mutation (17Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18De Craene J.-O. Soetens O. André B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43939-43948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This mutation results in a markedly reduced level of the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase Npi1/Rsp5, leading to non-ubiquitination of Gap1 (9Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 10Springael J.Y. Andre B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 36Springael J.Y. De Craene J.O. Andre B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These observations raise the interesting possibility that direct sorting of Gap1 from the late secretory pathway to the vacuole involves ubiquitination of the permease. To investigate this possibility, we monitored the fate of newly synthesized Gap1 in wild-type, npr1Δ,npi1, and npr1Δ npi1 cells (Fig.1 A). The cells were first grown on glutamine medium to repress transcription of the GAP1 gene, then transferred to proline medium to relieve repression. In the wild type, this resulted in the appearance of a high intensity Gap1 signal on immunoblots and of high Gap1 activity in citrulline uptake assays (Fig. 1 A). The npi1strain displayed a similar phenotype. In the npr1Δ mutant, in keeping with the observation that Gap1 is directly sorted from the secretory pathway to the vacuole (18De Craene J.-O. Soetens O. André B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43939-43948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), no Gap1 activity was measured and only a low quantity of Gap1 was detectable after the cells were shifted to proline medium. The npr1Δ npi1 strain displayed a phenotype similar to that observed with the wild-type and npi1 strains, indicating that in the double mutant, neosynthesized Gap1 is targeted to the cell surface rather than to the vacuole. To confirm this result, we placed the GAP1 gene under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter and monitored the neosynthesis of Gap1 by adding galactose to cells grown on a raffinose-proline medium (Fig. 1 B). As expected, this resulted in the progressive increase of Gap1 activity in the wild type, indicating that Gap1 was delivered to the plasma membrane, whereas the permease remained inactive in the npr1Δmutant. In the npr1Δ pep12Δ double mutant lacking the t-SNARE (target-soluble N-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptor) protein Pep12 (required for transport of proteins from the Golgi to the late endosome/pre-vacuolar compartment) (37Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), Gap1 activity gradually appeared after galactose addition in a manner similar to that in the pep12Δ mutant. This confirms that the pep12Δ mutation largely suppresses the effect of the npr1Δ mutation, even though the activity in the pep12Δ strain is lower than in the wild type (18De Craene J.-O. Soetens O. André B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43939-43948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The same phenotype was observed in the npr1Δ npi1 strain (Fig.1 B). These results confirm those of Fig. 1 A and show that sorting of Gap1 from the late secretory pathway to the vacuole requires the ubiquitin ligase Npi1/Rsp5. They also show that when Npi1/Rsp5 is lacking, at least part of the neosynthesized Gap1 is rerouted to the plasma membrane. To further assess the role of ubiquitin in the direct sorting of Gap1 from the Golgi to the vacuole, we monitored the fate of neosynthesized Gap1 in npr1Δ cells also lacking the Npi2/Doa4 ubiquitin hydrolase. This enzyme facilitates ubiquitin recycling from proteasome-targeted substrates (38Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In mutants affected in the Npi2/Doa4 ubiquitin hydrolase, the internal pool of ubiquitin is reduced severalfold (8Galan J. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 19Springael J.Y. Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar); this impairs ubiquitination and the subsequent down-regulation of Gap1, which normally occur when NH4+ is added to proline-grown cells (19Springael J.Y. Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type, npi2,npr1Δ, and npr1Δ npi2 strains were grown on glutamine medium and then shifted to proline medium (Fig.2). As expected, Gap1 remained inactive in the npr1Δ strain, and the quantity of Gap1 detected was much lower than in the wild type. In the npr1Δ npi2strain, Gap1 was as active as in the wild type, and an even higher amount of Gap1 was detected after the cells were shifted to proline medium, indicating that the npi2 mutation results in rerouting of neosynthesized Gap1 to the plasma membrane. In the npr1Δ npi2 strain overexpressing ubiquitin, a phenotype similar to that of the npr1Δ strain was observed, confirming that the effect of the npi2 mutation can be overcome by increasing the internal ubiquitin pool. Hence, direct sorting to the vacuole of neosynthesized Gap1 in npr1Δcells requires a normal pool of ubiquitin, and if this pool is too limiting, Gap1 is rerouted to the plasma membrane. The data presented above show that direct sorting to the vacuole of newly synthesized Gap1, as occurs in the npr1Δ mutant, requires normal levels of both Npi1/Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase and monomeric ubiquitin. These results suggest that ubiquitination of Gap1 could be required for its sorting to the vacuole. To test this hypothesis, experiments were conducted to isolate a mutant form of Gap1 resistant to ubiquitination. Previous work has identified the lysine residues of several permeases to which ubiquitin is attached (11Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 13Gitan R.S. Eide D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 14Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the uracil permease, for instance, ubiquitin is covalently linked to two lysine residues in a PEST region at the extreme N terminus (positions 38 and 41) (40Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When these residues are mutated, ubiquitination and endocytosis of the permease are impaired. Each residue, furthermore, is subject to poly-ubiquitination, the ubiquitin moieties of the poly-ubiquitin chains being linked via the Lys63 residue of ubiquitin (41Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23608-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the case of the tryptophan permease Tat2, a protein homologous in sequence to Gap1, mutation of the five lysine residues present in the 31 N-terminal amino acids preceding the first transmembrane domain were needed to protect the permease against down-regulation induced by rapamycin treatment (11Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to mutagenize lysine residues present in the cytosolic N terminus of Gap1. Two Gap1 mutants were thus constructed in which lysine residues were replaced with arginine, respectively, at positions 9 and 16 (Gap1K9K16) and positions 51, 56, 60, and 63 (Gap1K51–K63) (Fig.3 A).

https://openalex.org/W2314976329,"Primary cultures of Sertoli cells provide an interesting model to study how signalling pathways induced by a single hormone in a single cell type evolve, depending on the developmental stage. In vivo, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) induces proliferation of Sertoli cells in neonate and controls the subsequent differentiation of the entire population. Molecular mechanisms underlying Sertoli cell pleiotropic responses to FSH have long been investigated. But to date, only cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) activation has been reported to account for most FSH biological activities in male. Here, we demonstrate that FSH activates the ERK MAP kinase pathway following dual coupling of the FSH-R both to Gs and to Gi heterotrimeric proteins, in a PKA- and also Src-dependent manner. This activation is required for FSH-induced proliferation of Sertoli cells isolated 5 days after birth. Consistently, we show that the ERK-mediated FSH mitogenic effect triggers upregulation of cyclin D1. In sharp contrast, at 19 days after birth, as cells proceed through their differentiation program, the ERK pathway is dramatically inhibited by FSH treatment. Taken together, these results show that FSH can exert opposite effects on the ERK signalling cascade during the maturation process of Sertoli cells. Thus, signalling modules triggered by the FSH-R evolve dynamically throughout development of FSH natural target cells."
https://openalex.org/W2095237894,"Dynamic control of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene expression requires the regulated assembly and disassembly of the enhanceosome, a higher-order nucleoprotein complex formed in response to virus infection. The enhanceosome activates transcription by recruiting the histone acetyltransferase proteins CREB binding protein (CBP) and p300/CBP-associated factors (PCAF)/GCN5, which, in addition to modifying histones, acetylate HMGI(Y), the architectural component required for enhanceosome assembly. We show that the accurate execution of the IFN-beta transcriptional switch depends on the ordered acetylation of the high-mobility group I protein HMGI(Y) by PCAF/GCN5 and CBP, which acetylate HMGI(Y) at distinct lysine residues on endogenous promoters. Whereas acetylation of HMGI(Y) by CBP at lysine-65 destabilizes the enhanceosome, acetylation of HMGI(Y) by PCAF/GCN5 at lysine-71 potentiates transcription by stabilizing the enhanceosome and preventing acetylation by CBP."

To study mechanisms of IGF action in muscle, we developed a myogenic cell line that overexpresses IGF-binding protein-5. C2BP5 cells remain quiescent in low serum differentiation medium until the addition of IGF-I. Here we use this cell line to identify signaling pathways controlling IGF-mediated differentiation.

In cultured muscle cells, activation of the IGF-I receptor through endogenously produced IGF-II promotes terminal differentiation through signal transduction pathways that have not been elucidated completely, although current evidence suggests a role for PI 3-kinase in this process (11Coolican S.A.

Autocrine IGF-II also plays a central role in maintaining cell viability during the transition from proliferating to differentiating myoblasts, and recent studies from our laboratory identify a signaling pathway requiring PI 3-kinase, Akt, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21/waf1/cip1 in IGF-mediated myoblast survival (33Lawlor M.A. Feng X.

The current experiments were initiated to identify mechanisms of IGF-regulated myoblast differentiation. We previously established a myogenic cell line derived from C2 myoblasts by stable transfection of the IGF-binding protein, IGFBP-5 (36James P.L. Stewart C.E.H. Rotwein P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). C2BP5 myoblasts exhibit minimal differentiation under typical low serum conditions but can be induced to express muscle-specific mRNAs and proteins and form multinucleated myotubes after incubation with IGF analogues that activated the IGF-I receptor (36James P.L. Stewart C.E.H. Rotwein P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Using these cells as well as parental C2 myoblasts and neonatal mouse myoblasts in primary culture, we show that IGF-stimulated activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt are sufficient to promote full myogenic differentiation.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) were grown on gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes at 37 °C in medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 10% newborn calf serum, and 400 µg/ml G418 (growth medium) until confluent density was reached. Differentiation was initiated by incubating cells in low serum differentiation medium (DM) consisting of DMEM with 2% horse serum without or with R3IGF-I (2 nm final concentration) plus various additives as indicated. C2 cells (37Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) were incubated at 37 °C on gelatin-coated dishes in growth medium consisting of 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 10% newborn calf serum until >90% confluent. Differentiation was initiated by incubating cells in DM plus various additives as indicated. Primary mouse myoblasts were isolated as described (38Rando T.A. Blau H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1275-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Thigh muscles of 6-day-old C57Bl6 mice (6–7 mice per group) were minced and incubated with trituration at 15-min intervals for 30–45 min at 37 °C in 2 ml/g DMEM containing 2.4 units/ml dispase and 1% w/v collagenase II. After filtration through 80 µm nylon mesh, the cells were centrifuged at 1200 rpm and suspended in growth medium (Ham's F-10 supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor-2). After pre-plating on 2 wells of a 6-well collagen-coated tissue culture dish for 60 min, non-attached cells were transferred to 2 other wells and incubated in growth medium until >90% confluent. Cells were then detached with trypsin/EDTA, centrifuged at 1200 rpm, suspended in growth medium at a density of 3–5 × 105cells/ml, and incubated on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes until >90% confluent. Differentiation was initiated by incubating cells in DM plus various additives as indicated. C2BP5 cells were transfected overnight at ∼50% confluent density using Fugene-6 and a protocol described by the supplier (2 µg of DNA/6 µl of Fugene-6 in 1 ml of growth medium/well of a 12-well culture dish). On the following day, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh growth medium was added. When the cells reached >90% confluent density, growth medium was replaced with DM with or without supplements as indicated, incubated at 37 °C for various times, and fixed for immunocytochemistry with 4% paraformaldehyde. The previously described iAkt plasmid (33Lawlor M.A. Feng X. Everding D.R. Sieger K. Stewart C.E.H. Rotwein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was used to create a recombinant adenovirus with the AdEasy Vector kit (Quantum Biotechnologies). First, the iAkt cDNA was isolated from its plasmid by restriction digestion with SalI and NheI endonucleases. After both sites were made blunt with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, the DNA was ligated into the EcoRV site of a modified pShuttle plasmid (AdEasy kit) containing a tetracycline-inducible promoter. This pShuttle:TetR:iAkt recombinant plasmid was linearized and recombined with the pAdEasy plasmid in Escherichia colistrain BJ5183 as described by the manufacturer. Five micrograms of purified pAdEasy:TetR:iAkt plasmid was then digested withPacI endonuclease and transfected into low passage HEK293 cells using Fugene-6 at a ratio of 1 µg of plasmid DNA and 5 µl of Fugene 6. After 2 days the transfected cells were replated in 6-well dishes, and growth medium containing 1.25% Seaplaque-agarose was added 1 day later to promote formation of recombinant viral plaques, as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 17 days later individual plaques were picked, amplified in the HEK293 cells, and purified over a discontinuous CsCl gradient, as outlined in the supplier's protocol. Cells were co-infected with equal amounts of two recombinant adenoviruses, one encoding a tetracycline-inhibited transactivator (tTA), and the other a tTA-regulated gene expressing 4-hydroxytamoxifen (HT)-inducible HA-tagged membrane-targeted Akt (iAkt). Myoblasts at ∼50% confluent density were washed once with PBS and then incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and an equal mixture of both viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 2000 (C2BP5 cells) or 1000 (C2 cells and primary myoblasts). Medium was then replaced with fresh growth medium, and the cells were incubated until reaching confluent density before being used for differentiation experiments. Cells cultured on 12- or 24-well dishes were washed with PBS followed by fixation for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then washed 3 times for 5 min each with PBS and incubated in methanol:acetone (50:50, vol:vol) for 1 min. After 3 washes for 15 min each with PBS, cells were blocked with 0.5% normal goat serum in PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1–2 h at 15 °C. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted with blocking solution to the following concentrations: monoclonal anti-myogenin IgG1, 1:500; polyclonal rabbit anti-myogenin, 1:1000; monoclonal anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC) IgG2b, 1:500; monoclonal anti-Myc IgG1, 1:1500; monoclonal anti-FLAG IgG1, 1:1000; and monoclonal anti-HA IgG1, 1:1000. After three additional washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 2 h at 15 °C in the dark with secondary antibodies in blocking solution as follows: goat anti-mouse IgG1- fluorescein isothiocyanate, 1:500–1:1500; goat anti-mouse IgG2b-Texas Red, 1:500–1:1500; goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 594, 1:1000. Hoechst 33258 nuclear dye was added with secondary antibodies at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Finally, cells were washed 3 times in PBS. Fluorescent images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse T300 fluorescent microscope with a Photometrics CoolSNAP fx camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) and an Apple Macintosh G4 computer using IPLabs software, ver. 3.5 (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA). Image processing was performed using Photoshop version 5.5 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Protein extracts were isolated after washing cells twice with cold PBS and incubating for 20 min at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1.0% deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors, 1 µmokadaic acid, and 1 µm sodium orthovanadate. After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 8 min at 4 °C, protein concentration was determined by BCA assay. Protein extracts (30 or 40 µg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions and transferred onto 0.45 µm nitrocellulose membranes as described (33Lawlor M.A. Feng X. Everding D.R. Sieger K. Stewart C.E.H. Rotwein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with blocking buffer consisting of 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1–2 h at 15 °C and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies in blocking buffer (anti-myogenin, 1:500; anti-cdk4, 1:500; anti-phosphorylated Akt, 1:1000; anti-Akt, 1:1000). After 3 washes with TBST, incubation with AP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 90 min (1:3000 in blocking buffer), and an additional 3 washes with TBST, immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemifluorescence followed by detection using a Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Immune complex-kinase assays were performed using a protocol modified from an assay kit purchased from New England Biolabs. Cell lysates (200 µg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with an agarose-conjugated antibody to Akt (20 µl). The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 500 µl of cell lysis buffer and twice with 500 µl of kinase assay buffer. After resuspension in 40 µl of kinase assay buffer containing the Akt substrate GSK-3α and 200 µm ATP, the reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 30 min. After stopping the reaction by the addition of concentrated electrophoresis loading buffer, samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, as described above. Immunoblotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibody to phospho-GSK-3α/β, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemifluorescence and detected using the Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One software, as above. Results are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using independent Student's t test for paired samples. Results were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. We previously established muscle cell lines derived from C2 myoblasts stably transfected with a mouse IGFBP-5 cDNA (C2BP5 cells). These cells did not undergo significant morphological or biochemical differentiation unless IGF-I, IGF-II, or analogues that activated the IGF-I receptor were added to low serum DM (36James P.L. Stewart C.E.H. Rotwein P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows that C2BP5 cells expressed little MHC or myogenin after up to 4 days in DM and formed few multinucleated myotubes unless the analogue R3IGF-I, which binds to the IGF-I receptor but not IGFBP-5 (39Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was included in the medium. After 4 days, nearly 30% of IGF-treated cells produced myogenin compared with <2% of myoblasts incubated in DM alone (Fig. 1B), and large myotubes were seen in IGF-treated cultures versusalmost none in DM (Fig. 1A). As seen by immunoblotting, in IGF-I-treated cells myogenin was readily induced within 2 days, and expression was increased for up to 4 days, whereas little myogenin was detected in myoblasts incubated in DM alone (Fig. 1C). A similar pattern of differential induction of differentiation was observed in myoblasts cultured for up to 7 days in DM without or with R3IGF-I (data not shown). Thus, the addition of IGF-I promotes differentiation of C2BP5 muscle cells. Previous studies with several muscle cell lines indicate that inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity could interfere with myoblast differentiation (11Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J.

Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34424-34432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the PI 3-kinase pathway in IGF-mediated muscle differentiation, C2BP5 cells were incubated with R3IGF-I in the presence of the drug LY294002, a specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor (41Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5218-5241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2, A and B, LY294002 added at day 0 prevented IGF-stimulated production of myogenin, blocked expression of MHC, and abrogated production of multinucleated myofibers for up to 4 days but did not alter cell viability. Similar results were observed in parental C2 cells, where LY294002 diminished expression of myogenin (Fig. 2C), and in mouse limb myoblasts in primary culture, where LY294002 blocked myogenin and MHC expression and blunted myotube formation (Fig.2D). In the latter cells, LY294002 diminished survival by ∼20%. Thus, LY294002 inhibits differentiation in C2BP5 myoblasts and in other cultured muscle cells. We next asked if the blockade of PI 3-kinase activity interfered with muscle differentiation even after it was initiated. C2BP5 cells were incubated in DM plus R3IGF-I for 2 days, after which LY294002 or vehicle (Me2SO4) was added in the presence of additional R3IGF-I for a further 1 or 2 days. As shown in Fig. 3, LY294002 prevented the further increase in myogenin protein expression that normally occurred during this period and also attenuated production of myotubes. These results indicate that continued signaling through the IGF-I receptor and PI 3-kinase are needed for full differentiation of C2BP5 myoblasts. As a further test of the requirement for PI 3-kinase activity in muscle differentiation, C2BP5 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding either a constitutively active or kinase-deficient form of PI 3-kinase (p110* or p110Δkin, respectively). After incubation of cells in DM without IGF-I for 2 days, only 5 ± 0.4% of myoblasts transfected with p110Δkin expressed MHC, a value not different from results obtained using an enhanced green fluorescent protein expression vector (2.5 ± 0.5%, Fig. 4). By contrast, 25.7 ± 2% of cells transfected with p110* were also positive for MHC (p < 0.008), results equivalent to those observed with a myogenin expression plasmid (27 ± 1.2%). Surprisingly, the ability of myogenin to stimulate myoblast differentiation was significantly inhibited when cells were incubated with LY294002 (Fig. 4, 7.5 ± 1.1%, p < 0.009). Taken together, the results in Figs. 3 and 4 suggest that sustained IGF-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity is needed to maintain muscle differentiation. These observations additionally indicate that IGF-mediated PI 3-kinase activation is part of a signaling pathway involved both in induction of myogenin expression and in potentiation of myogenin action on differentiation. Thus, PI 3-kinase appears to function both upstream and downstream of myogenin during muscle differentiation in C2BP5 cells. Akt is one of the major downstream effector molecules for PI 3-kinase-regulated signaling pathways (42Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) and has been linked to a variety of biological effects in skeletal muscle cells, including control of early"

In cells growing on proline or urea as the sole nitrogen source, newly synthesized Gap1 is delivered to the plasma membrane, where it accumulates. Upon addition of NH4+, a preferential nitrogen source, Gap1 is endocytosed and targeted to the vacuole, where it is degraded. This down-regulation requires ubiquitination of the permease, and this ubiquitination is dependent on the essential Npi1/Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase. In this study, we investigated the role of the Npr1 kinase in the regulation of Gap1 trafficking. We show that Npr1 is required for stabilization of Gap1 at the plasma membrane: when an npr1 ts mutant growing on proline is shifted to the restrictive temperature, Gap1 down-regulation is triggered, as it is when NH4+ is added to wild-type cells. The fate of newly synthesized Gap1 en route to the plasma membrane is also under Npr1 control: in an npr1Δ mutant, neosynthesized Gap1 is sorted from the Golgi to the vacuole without passing via the plasma membrane. Similar direct sorting of neosynthesized Gap1 to the vacuole was observed in wild-type cells grown on NH4+. Finally, Gap1 is phosphorylated in NPR1 cells, but this phosphorylation is not strictly dependent on Npr1. Our results show that Npr1 kinase plays a central role in the physiological control of Gap1 trafficking and that this control is exerted not only on Gap1 present at the plasma membrane but also on Gap1 late in the secretory pathway. Npr1 belongs to a subgroup of protein kinases, some of which are reported to exert a positive control on the activity of other permeases. We propose that these kinases also function as regulators of permease trafficking.

The Lst4, Lst7, and Lst8 proteins of unknown biochemical function are also involved in sorting Gap1 from the Golgi to the cell surface (12Roberg K.J. Bickel S. Rowley N. Kaiser C.A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1569-1584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the last step of Gap1 secretion is dependent on Sec6 (7Roberg K.J. Rowley N. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), a component of the exocyst (13Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 251-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Trafficking of Gap1 is subject to nitrogen regulation. When cells are grown on glutamate, newly synthesized Gap1 is sorted directly from the Golgi to the vacuole, instead of to the plasma membrane (7Roberg K.J. Rowley N. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Pep12, a t-SNARE1 involved in the fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles with the prevacuolar compartment (14Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), is required for this direct sorting of Gap1 to the vacuole (7Roberg K.J. Rowley N. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Gap1 permease at the plasma membrane is also subject to nitrogen regulation: the addition of NH4+ to proline- or urea-grown cells triggers progressive and complete loss of Gap1 activity (15Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and repression of GAP1 gene expression (16Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The loss of Gap1 activity is the result of Gap1 internalization and subsequent targeting to the vacuole for degradation in a process called down-regulation of Gap1 (17Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 18Springael J.Y. André B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Like that of many plasma membrane proteins (19Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar, 20Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), down-regulation of Gap1 requires its conjugation to ubiquitin (18Springael J.Y. André B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 21Springael J.Y. Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Npi1/Rsp5, a HECT (homologous to the E6-associated protein Carboxyl Terminus)-type ubiquitin ligase essential to cell viability (17Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar,22Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), is required for this ubiquitination (18Springael J.Y. André B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). NPR1 is another gene involved in posttranscriptional control of Gap1. In npr1 mutants growing on proline or urea, the amount of GAP1 transcripts is unaltered (23Vandenbol M. Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but Gap1 is inactive (24Dubois E. Grenson M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 175: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Other NH4+-sensitive permeases, including the proline permease Put4 (23Vandenbol M. Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the ureidosuccinate and allantoate permease Dal5 (26Rai R. Genbauffe F.S. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 266-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the inducible γ-aminobutyrate-specific permease Uga4 (27André B. Hein C. Grenson M. Jauniaux J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), are also dependent on Npr1 to be active. Sequencing of the cloned NPR1 gene showed that it encodes a kinase homologue with a serine-rich N terminus (23Vandenbol M. Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,28Vandenbol M. Jauniaux J.C. Vissers S. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic studies have shown that Npr1 belongs to a fungus-specific subfamily of protein kinases (29Hunter T. Plowman G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Some members of this subfamily (kinases Ptk1/Stk1 and Stk2) are essential determinants of polyamine transport (30Kaouass M. Audette M. Ramotar D. Verma S. De Montigny D. Gamache I. Torossian K. Poulin R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2994-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); others (kinases Sat4/Hal4 and Hal5) are essential determinants of Trk1-Trk2 potassium transporter activity (31Mulet J.M. Leube M.P. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3328-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms through which these protein kinases affect the activity of transport proteins remain unclear. Previous studies have shown that Npr1 inactivation in proline-grown cells results in progressive loss of Gap1 activity, a response similar to that observed after the addition of NH4+ to wild-type cells (15Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations inhibiting Gap1 down-regulation, which include npi1 and gap1 pgr, also suppress the negative effect of the npr1 mutation on Gap1 activity (15Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 32Hein C. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with a role of Npr1 in the control of Gap1 trafficking. Recently, it was shown that Npr1 phosphorylation is regulated by nitrogen through the Tor signaling pathway: nitrogen starvation or growth on proline results in Npr1 dephosphorylation, whereas Npr1 undergoes Tor-dependent phosphorylation in cells grown on NH4+ medium or rich medium (33Schmidt A. Beck T. Koller A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6924-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Under starvation conditions, i.e. conditions of high Npr1-supported Gap1 activity (25Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), Npr1 also promotes Npi1/Rsp5-dependent destabilization of Tat2, a tryptophan permease that is also regulated by nitrogen but inversely compared with Gap1 (34Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We show here that the Npr1 kinase plays a central role in nitrogen-regulated trafficking of the Gap1 permease. Like the Sec13 and Lst proteins, Npr1 is required for transport of neosynthesized Gap1 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. In npr1Δ mutants, neosynthesized Gap1 is directly sorted from the Golgi to the vacuole, bypassing the plasma membrane. Npr1 is also required to maintain Gap1 at the plasma membrane because inactivation of Npr1 triggers endocytosis of Gap1, followed by its degradation in the vacuole. A model involving Npr1 in the transport of both neosynthesized and constitutively internalized Gap1 from an internal compartment to the plasma membrane is discussed. All S. cerevisiae strains (Table I) used in this study are isogenic with Σ1278b (35Béchet J. Grenson M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) or NY13 (36Horazdovsky B.F. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4953-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in minimal buffered medium (37Jacobs P. Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with 3% glucose as the carbon source, except when indicated otherwise. In steady-state experiments, cells were grown on proline (10 mm) as the sole nitrogen source. In Gap1 neosynthesis experiments, cells were exponentially grown on glutamine (5 mm) and transferred to proline medium to relieve GAP1 repression. Temperature shifts were performed by filtering cells growing at permissive temperature and resuspending them in proline medium preheated to the restrictive temperature. Plasmids pGST-NGap1 and FGST05.1, used to produce GST fused to the N terminus of Gap1 (amino acids 1–90) or to the C terminus of Pma1 (amino acids 843–918), respectively, were obtained by PCR amplification of the corresponding gene fragments using total DNA from strain Σ1278b as template and primers GST1 and GST2 for GAP1 and primers GST3 and GST4 for PMA1(Table II). The amplified DNA fragments flanked by BamHI (5′ end) and XhoI (3′ end) restriction sites were cloned into plasmid pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmid constructions were sequenced to verify in-frame fusion to GST and the absence of mutations in the amplified fragments. To construct plasmid YCpCJ025 bearing the Gal1-GAP1-GFP fusion gene, the GAP1 open reading frame was first amplified by PCR using primers 5GAL1-GAP1 and 3GAL1-GAP1 (Table II) and plasmid YCpGAP1 as template. The amplified DNA fragment was then cloned into the BamHI-linearized pRS416-GAL plasmid by recombination in yeast to generate plasmid YCpCJ004. A DNA fragment containing GFP was then amplified by PCR using primers 5GALGAP1GFP and 3GALGAP1GFP2 (Table II) and total DNA of strain 34288b as template. The amplified fragment was then cloned into HindIII-linearized YCpCJ004 by recombination in yeast to generate YCpCJ025. Isolation of the GAL1-GAP1-GFPconstructs was performed by comparing the fluorescence of URA3 + clones grown on proline glucose or proline galactose media.Table IStrains used in this studyStrainGenotypeReference23344cMATα ura3Laboratory collection21994bMATα npr1 ura3(28Vandenbol M.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To avoid competitive inhibition of citrulline transport by glutamine, cells grown on glutamine medium were filtered, washed, and transferred to preheated proline medium just before the transport assay. The permease was inactivated by adding preheated (NH4)2SO4 to the culture (final concentration, 10 mm). To raise polyclonal antibodies against the N-terminal region of Gap1 and the C-terminal region of Pma1, the GST-Gap1 and GST-Pma1 fusion proteins were produced in RKB304 bacteria, and their synthesis was induced for 3 h with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The fusion proteins were then purified from lysates by means of agarose beads linked to glutathione (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specificity of the rabbit antisera was tested by comparing the signal pattern obtained in a wild-type versus a gap1Δ strain or a pma1Δ strain expressing a plant H+-ATPase (39de Kerchove d.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23828-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) complementing the pma1Δ mutation. Crude cell extracts (17Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and membrane-enriched preparations (18Springael J.Y. André B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. In Western blot experiments, the protein concentration was assessed by densitometry of the Pma1 signal (ImageMaster1D; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal quantities of protein were loaded on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in a Tricine system (40Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). To detect the ubiquitinated forms of Gap1, the extracts were loaded on a 12% gel in Laemmli’s system (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll), the proteins were probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against Gap1 (1:10,000) or Pma1 (1:1000). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Approximately 108 cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 mNaCl) and vortexed for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 3 min to eliminate cell debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged in fresh tubes at 21,000 × g for 40 min. Pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 5m urea, incubated at 0 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 40 min. The pellets were resuspended in alkaline phosphatase buffer with 0.2% SDS. 20 units of alkaline phosphatase was added to the extracts, which were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Samples were finally subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. The pep12Δ and the npr1Δ null mutations were constructed by the PCR-based gene deletion method (42Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). Plasmid pFA6a-kanMX2 served as template to generate DNA fragment npr1::kanMX2 with primers DEL1 and DEL2 and DNA fragment pep12::kanMX2 with primers DEL3 and DEL4 (Table II). Plasmid pFA6a-kanMX6-PGAL1 (43Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. DeMarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar) served to generate the GAL1-GAP1 DNA fragment with primers GAL1 and GAL2. Plasmid pGA5-GFP(S65T)kanMX6 (44Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) served as template for C-terminal GFP tagging of Gap1 by amplification of a DNA fragment with primers GFP1 and GFP2 (Table II). Strains were transformed with the PCR fragments by the lithium method (45Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (46Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on complete medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.). Living cells were fixed on a thin layer of agarose and examined with a Nikon E600 epifluorescence microscope with an HQ-FITC-BP filter cube (Chroma) for blue excitation. Pictures were collected with a SONY DXC-9100P camera and processed with Adobe Photoshop for display. The Gap1 permease is most active in cells growing on media containing a poor nitrogen source (proline, urea, low NH4+), and the Npr1 kinase is essential to this activity (25Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine whether Npr1 affects phosphorylation of Gap1, total protein extracts were prepared from the wild-type and npr1 mutant strains grown on proline medium. Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gels were probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against the N terminus of Gap1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig.1 A). Less Gap1 was detected in the npr1 mutants than in the wild-type. Furthermore, two distinct bands were clearly detected in the npr1Δ extract: a minor upper band migrating like the main Gap1 signal detected in the wild-type extract, and a major, faster-migrating lower band. To test whether phosphorylation could account for the slower migration of Gap1 in the wild-type, total protein extracts were treated with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1 B). This resulted in a decrease in the apparent molecular weight of Gap1. The underphosphorylated form of the permease migrated like the major band observed in the npr1Δ extract, with or without treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1 B). Hence, the Npr1 kinase is required for normal accumulation and normal phosphorylation of Gap1. However, Npr1 does not seem to be directly involved in Gap1 phosphorylation: in the npr1Δ npi1 double mutant, which is also defective in the Npi1/Rsp5 ubiquitin protein ligase, Gap1 is fully active and migrates as a high molecular weight form that is a phosphorylated form of the permease, as judged by the effect of alkaline phosphatase treatment (Fig. 1 B). These results show that phosphorylation of Gap1 is not strictly dependent on Npr1. To further investigate the possible role of Npr1 in regulation of Gap1 trafficking, we examined the influence of a thermosensitive npr1 mutation on Gap1 preaccumulated at the plasma membrane. In the npr1 ts strain grown at 29 °C on proline medium, Gap1 was as active as in wild-type cells (16.7 versus 16.5 nmol.min−1.mg−1protein, respectively), suggesting a normal level of Gap1 at the plasma membrane. Shifting cells to the restrictive temperature (35 °C) induced progressive and complete loss of Gap1 activity (Fig.2 A). Total cellular extracts were prepared from npr1 ts and wild-type cells and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The immunoblot shows that loss of Gap1 activity induced by transferring npr1 ts cells to 35 °C is accompanied by destabilization of the permease (Fig. 2 B). As observed in npr1 mutants grown on proline (Fig. 1 A), a small amount of dephosphorylated Gap1 persisted in the npr1 ts strain 3 h after the temperature shift (Fig. 2 B). The loss of Gap1 activity and the degradation of Gap1 induced by Npr1 inactivation are likely due to endocytosis and vacuolar degradation of the permease, as seen in wild-type cells after the addition of NH4+ (17Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 18Springael J.Y. André B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To confirm the vacuolar location of Gap1 degradation upon Npr1 inactivation, we deleted the PEP4 gene, which is required for enzymatic activation of vacuolar proteases (47Zubenko G.S. Park F.J. Jones E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), in the npr1 tsstrain. Shifting npr1 ts pep4Δ cells to 35 °C induced a rapid loss of Gap1 activity (Fig. 2 A), but the permease remained stable (Fig. 2 B). These results show that the continuous presence of a functional Npr1 protein is required to maintain Gap1 at the plasma membrane: upon loss of the Npr1 function, Gap1 undergoes endocytosis and targeting to the vacuole, where it is degraded. Down-regulation of Gap1 induced by the addition of NH4+ to proline-grown cells requires ubiquitination of Gap1; this modification is dependent on Npi1/Rsp5, a ubiquitin ligase essential to viability (17Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 18Springael J.Y. André B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To test the role of Npi1/Rsp5 in Gap1 down-regulation induced by the loss of Npr1 function, we used an npr1 ts strain with an additional npi1 mutation. The latter mutation causes a severe reduction of the amount of Npi1/Rsp5, thus preventing ubiquitination of Gap1 without altering cell viability (18Springael J.Y. André B. Mol. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2082576063,"The interaction of the copper chaperone Atx1 and the first cytosolic domain of Ccc2 ATPase, Ccc2a, was investigated by NMR in solution. In particular, a solution of Cu(I)-15NAtx1 was titrated with apo-Ccc2a, and, vice versa, a solution of Cu(I)-15NCcc2a was titrated with apo-Atx1. By following the 15N and 1H chemical shifts, a new species is detected in both experiments. This species is the same in both titrations and is in fast exchange with the parent species on the NMR time scale. Nuclear relaxation data are consistent with the formation of an adduct. Judging from the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy patterns, the structure of Cu(I)-15NCcc2a in the presence of apo-Atx1 is not significantly altered, whereas Cu(I)-15NAtx1 in the presence of apo-Ccc2a experiences some changes with respect to both the apoproteins and the Cu(I)-loaded proteins. The structure of the Cu(I)-15NAtx1 moiety in the adduct was obtained from 1137 nuclear Overhauser effects to a final root mean square deviation to the mean structure of 0.76 ± 0.13 Å for the backbone and 1.11 ± 0.11 Å for the heavy atoms. 15N and 1H chemical shifts suggest the regions of interaction that, together with independent information, allow a structural model of the adduct to be proposed. The apo form of Atx1 displays significant mobility in loops 1 and 5, the N-terminal part of helix α1, and the C-terminal part of helix α2 on the ms–µs time scale. These regions correspond to the metal binding site. Such mobility is largely reduced in the free Cu(I)-Atx1 and in the adduct with apo-Ccc2a. The analogous mobility of Ccc2a in both Cu(I) and apo forms is reduced with respect to Atx1. Such an adduct is relevant as a structural and kinetic model for copper transfer from Atx1 to Ccc2a in physiological conditions.

All of these structures share a classical “ferredoxin-like” β1-α1-β2-β3-α2-β4folding (27Hubbard T.J.P. Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), where the secondary structure elements, four β-strands and two α-helices, are connected by loop regions. Structural studies of Atx1 indicate that the metal-binding motif MXCXXC is located in a surface-exposed loop, with the two cysteines located in the first loop and the beginning of the first α-helix (23Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26Rosenzweig A.C. Huffman D.L. Hou M.Y. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Structure. 1999; 7: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Cu(I)-Atx1 can donate its metal ion cargo to the first N-terminal Atx1-like domain of Ccc2 in a direct and reversible manner (28Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations suggest that copper-trafficking proteins overcome the extraordinary copper chelation capacity of the eukaryotic cytoplasm by catalyzing the rate of copper transfer between physiological partners. In this sense, metallochaperones work like enzymes, carefully tailoring energetic barriers along specific reaction pathways but not others. The thermodynamic gradient for metal transfer is shallow, establishing that vectorial delivery of copper by Cu(I)-Atx1 is not based on a higher copper affinity of the target domain. Instead, Atx1 partner recognition allows rapid metal transfer and also protects Cu(I) from nonspecific reactions (12Pufahl R. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Cizewski Culotta V. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 28Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, it has been proposed that a low activation barrier for transfer between partners results from complementary electrostatic forces that ultimately orient the metal-binding loops of Atx1 and Ccc2a for formation of copper-bridged intermediates (28Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Atx1 possesses multiple positively charged lysines on its surface (23Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26Rosenzweig A.C. Huffman D.L. Hou M.Y. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Structure. 1999; 7: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), while Ccc2a possesses multiple negatively charged surface residues (24Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8415-8426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mutation of conserved lysines on the surface of Atx1 greatly reduces the copper-dependent interaction of Atx1 and Ccc2 in vivo (29Portnoy M.E. Rosenzweig A.C. Rae T. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Cizewski Culotta V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15041-15045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In particular, mutation of Lys65 of Atx1 to glutamate abrogates the function of this protein (29Portnoy M.E. Rosenzweig A.C. Rae T. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Cizewski Culotta V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15041-15045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), thus highlighting its important role in metallochaperone function. In contrast, Ccc2a contains a phenylalanine residue at this position (24Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8415-8426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition to electrostatic interactions between the two proteins, it also may be that the binding interface is templated by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions via juxtaposition of complementary surfaces. The x-ray structures of human Atx1 (Hah1) in the presence of Cu(I), Hg(II), and Cd(II) have been recently determined (30Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Lamb A.L. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In contrast with yeast Hg(II)-Atx1, which crystallizes as monomer and contains Hg(II) ion with a linear coordination geometry, Hah1 crystallizes as a homodimer. The structure of Cu(I)-Hah1 reveals a copper ion coordinated by cysteine residues from two adjacent Hah1 molecules in a distorted tetrahedral array, with the fourth ligand weakly bound. This result provides structural support for direct metal ion exchange between conserved MXCXXC motifs in two domains. Moreover, the structures of Hah1 (30Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Lamb A.L. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) provide support for three-coordinate intermediates proposed for the metal ion transfer mechanism (12Pufahl R. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Cizewski Culotta V. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The solution structures of Cu(I)-Atx1, apo-Atx1, Cu(I)-Ccc2a, and apo-Ccc2a provide insight into the important differences between the apo and Cu(I)-loaded forms of the proteins. Comparison of the Cu(I) and apo conformations of Atx1 reveals that the Cu(I) binding cysteines move from a buried site in the bound metal form to a solvent-exposed conformation on the surface of the protein after copper release (23Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). While the structure of Atx1 undergoes changes as a function of copper capture and release, the Ccc2a structure remains relatively invariant, suggesting that the metal site in apo-Ccc2a is more preorganized than in apo-Atx1 (24Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8415-8426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have characterized the interaction of Atx1 with Ccc2a. The interaction was investigated through 1H and15N chemical shift perturbation experiments, alternately labeling the two proteins and titrating with increasing amounts of unlabeled partner. A mapping of surface residues involved in protein-protein recognition and interaction is provided together with structural models of the two proteins in the adduct. Mobility studies point out differential dynamic behavior of Atx1 and Ccc2a as a function of copper capture and release. Relaxation measurements performed on the mixture support complex formation. The results suggest a more detailed mechanism for copper exchange between the chaperone protein Atx1 and its physiological partner Ccc2. Complex formation and dissociation is rapid on the NMR time scale with a half-life for the complex on the order of milliseconds. Isotopic labeling and protein purification was performed as previously described (23Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 24Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol.

Cu(I)-15NAtx1 and Cu(I)-15NCcc2a were prepared as described for the unlabeled proteins (28Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and exchanged by ultrafiltration into 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7, 90% H2O, 10% D2O. The final concentration of the Cu(I)-15NAtx1 NMR sample was 1.0 mm with a metal/protein ratio of 0.8:1.0. The final NMR sample concentration for Cu(I)-15NCcc2a was 0.8 mm, with a metal/protein ratio of 1.3:1.0. All NMR samples were prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere at 12 °C in a VacAtmospheres chamber, where they were loaded into 535-PP 5-mm quartz NMR tubes (Wilmad) and sealed with latex serum caps. Titrations of Cu(I)-15NAtx1 with unlabeled apo-Ccc2a and of Cu(I)-15NCcc2a with unlabeled apo-Atx1 were performed with NMR spectroscopy, following the 15N-1H spectral changes upon the addition of increasing amounts of the unlabeled proteins. Aliquots were added in a Coy chamber under nitrogen atmosphere at 298 K using a Hamilton syringe to deliver small amounts of unlabeled proteins to the labeled samples in NMR tubes. The starting Cu(I)-15NAtx1 and Cu(I)-15NCcc2a samples were 1.0 and 0.8 mm in concentration, respectively. The additions ranged from 0.05 to 0.9 mm in apo-Ccc2a and from 0.1 to 0.7 mm in apo-Atx1. The final labeled protein concentration was 0.7 mm for Cu(I)-15NAtx1 and 0.5 mm for Cu(I)-15NCcc2a. All of the NMR spectra except for1H-15N NOE,1 R1, and R2 relaxation experiments, were acquired on a Ultra Shield 700 Bruker spectrometer operating at proton nominal frequency of 700.13 MHz. A triple resonance 5-mm probe was used. All two-dimensional 15N HSQC (33Palmer III, A.G. Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 151-170Google Scholar, 34Kay L.E. Keifer P.

The same spectra were also recorded on Cu(I)-15NCcc2a/apo-Atx1 mixtures with protein ratios of 1:0.4 and 1:1. The two-dimensional NOESY experiments were acquired with a mixing time of 100 ms, a recycle time of 1 s, and a spectral window of 14 ppm. The TOCSY spectra were recorded with a spin lock time of 100 ms, a recycle time of 1 s, and a spectral window of 14 ppm. The three-dimensional NOESY-15N HSQC experiments were recorded with 160 (1H) × 88 (15N) × 1024 (1H) data points. In these experiments, the INEPT delay was set to 2.5 ms, the mixing time was 100 ms, and the carrier frequency was set at the center of the amide proton region, at 8.0 ppm. Spectral windows of 14, 14, and 33 ppm were used for the direct1H dimension and the indirect 1H and15N dimensions. Relaxation experiments were collected on Bruker Avance 500 and 400 spectrometers, operating at proton nominal frequencies of 500.13 and 400.13 MHz, respectively. Relaxation experiments on Cu(I)-15NAtx1 were carried out at 500 MHz. Relaxation experiments on apo-15NAtx1, on Cu(I)-15NAtx1 in the presence of apo-Ccc2a (final step of the titration at 1:1.25, Cu(I)-15NAtx1/apo-Ccc2a ratio), and on 15NCcc2a, in the apo and copper-bound forms, were carried out at 400 MHz. A triple resonance 5-mm probe was used with an Avance 500-MHz spectrometer, and a broad band observing probe for direct detection of the X nucleus was used with an Avance 400-MHz spectrometer. All of the probes were equipped with pulsed field gradients along the z axis. The 15N backbone longitudinal relaxation rates,R1, were measured as previously described (40Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar) using delays in the pulse sequence of 5, 35, 75, 125, 190, 270, 370, 500, 675, 1000, and 1750 ms for all samples. The 15N backbone transverse relaxation rates, R2, were measured using the CPMG sequence as described elsewhere using a refocusing delay (τCPMG) of 450 µs (40Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar). To monitor the changes of the transverse relaxation rates in the presence of relatively weak effective fields, R2 rates were also measured as a function of the τCPMG value (40Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K.

Experiments were collected at six CPMG refocusing delays τCPMG: 450, 550, 700, 850, 1000, and 1150 µs. Relaxation delays varied from 7 to 230 ms, the exact values depending on τCPMG. In the R1 andR2 measurements, eight scans were collected for each experiment. The heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE were measured using the pulse scheme published by Grzesiek and Bax (42Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) and considering the ratio of the peak volumes in spectra recorded with and without 1H saturation. For all experiments, quadrature detection in the indirect dimensions was performed in the time-proportional phase incrementation mode (43Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar), and water suppression was achieved through WATERGATE sequence (44Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar), except the heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE experiments, where the pulse sequence applies flip backpulses for water suppression. All two-dimensional NOESY and TOCSY spectra consisted of 4096 data points in the acquisition dimension and of 1024 experiments in the indirect dimension.R1, R2, and1H-15N NOE two-dimensional spectra consisted of 2048 data points in the acquisition dimension and of 256 experiments in the indirect dimension. All of the spectra were collected at 298 K, processed using the standard Bruker software (XWINNMR), and analyzed on IBM RISC 6000 computers through the XEASY program (45Eccles C. Güntert P. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Integration of cross peaks in the R1, R2, and1H-15N NOE measurements was performed by using the standard routine of the XWINNMR program. Relaxation ratesR1 and R2 were determined by fitting the cross-peak intensities (I), measured as a function of the delay (T) within the pulse sequence, to a single exponential decay by using the Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm (46Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar, 47Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing.

For R2, the phase cycle was chosen so that the magnetization relaxes to 0 for long relaxation delays; thus, in this case, A was set equal to 0 in the fitting procedure.

This program models overall rotational diffusion using a diffusion tensor, D.R1, R2, and NOE values for 15N spins are determined by the dipolar coupling with the attached proton and, for R1 andR2, also by the chemical shift anisotropy of the nitrogen spins.

This well orchestrated process of cell cycle withdrawal and initiation of differentiation is largely regulated by the MyoD and myocyte enhancer factor-2 families of transcription factors (1Olson E.N.

Most mitogens promote myoblast proliferation and inhibit differentiation, whereas insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II)1 stimulate both processes in muscle cell cultures (3Florini J.R.

In cultured myoblasts serum withdrawal often initiates the differentiation program, and it is believed that autocrine/paracrine actions of IGF-II in response to growth factor deprivation stimulate muscle differentiation (5Florini J.R.

The signaling pathways regulating myogenesis are beginning to be elucidated, one of which is the PI3K-Akt pathway (reviewed in Ref. 4Perry R.L.S. Rudnicki M.A. Front.

Other PI3K downstream effectors, including S6K1, may also participate in myogenic regulation, but the signaling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Rapamycin, a potent immunosuppressant of bacterial origin, inhibits cell growth and proliferation in a variety of organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. When complexed with the ubiquitous cellular protein FKBP12, rapamycin directly binds and inhibits mTOR (also named FRAP (FKBP12-rapamycin-associatedprotein) and RAFT1 (rapamycin andFKBP12 target 1)) (7Brown E.J.

A protein of likely pleiotropic functions, mTOR is best known for its role in regulating translation initiation (12Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Among several downstream effectors of the mTOR pathway, two best characterized ones are 4E-BP1 and S6K1, which regulate 5′-cap-dependent and 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract-dependent translation initiation, respectively (13Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar, 14Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. in Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-718Google Scholar). Both 4E-BP1 and S6K1 are regulated by mTOR and the PI3K pathway in parallel (12Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-718Google Scholar); each pathway is indispensable for the stimulation of both proteins. It has been well established that the kinase activity of mTOR is essential for S6K1 activation and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (15Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L.

The effect of rapamycin on myogenesis has been examined in several muscle cell culture systems, and the results have been controversial. Although rapamycin inhibits differentiation of some myoblasts (18Conejo R. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. J. Cell.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25385-25388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in some systems no rapamycin effect is observed (22Canicio J. Gallardo E. Illa I. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Kaliman P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 5042-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As the downstream effector of both the PI3K pathway and the mTOR pathway, S6K1 activity has been shown to increase during skeletal muscle differentiation in several cases (18Conejo R. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol.

However, whether S6K1 is required for myogenesis remains an unanswered question, and whether mTOR has an essential function in skeletal muscle differentiation has not been examined directly. In C2C12 muscle cell culture, we investigated the role of mTOR and its downstream effectors in muscle differentiation. Here we provide definitive evidence to support the essential role of mTOR in myogenesis and to exclude the requirement of S6K1. Furthermore, our observations reveal a novel signaling mechanism that governs the myogenic function of mTOR, which does not require the kinase activity of mTOR and most likely involves downstream effectors other than S6K1 and 4E-BP1.

C2C12 mouse myoblasts were maintained in DMEM containing 20% FBS and 0.5% chicken embryo extract at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For differentiation, cells were plated on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates (0.2% gelatin in PBS) and grown to 100% confluence, changed into differentiation medium (DMEM with 2% horse serum), and fed with fresh differentiation medium every day until myotubes were fully formed (3 days). C2C12 cells grown on 6-well plates to 40–50% confluence were transfected with 3 μg of DNA per well using PolyFect (Qiagen). After 24 h, the transfected cells were trypsinized and re-plated into growth medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 on 12-well plates. When the cells reached 100% confluence, differentiation was induced by incubation in differentiation medium with or without rapamycin for 3–4 days. C2C12 myoblasts or myotubes grown on tissue culture plates were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (made in PBS), permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with MF20 anti-MHC antibody (2 μg/ml in 3% BSA and PBS) and FITC-anti-mouse antibody (10 μg/ml in 3% BSA and PBS). The stained cells were examined under an inverted fluorescence microscope. Both phase contrast and fluorescent images were recorded using a CCD camera. Transfected or nontransfected C2C12 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mmNaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.3% Triton X-100). mTOR autokinase assays were performed as described previously (24Vilella-Bach M. Nuzzi P. Fang Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with immunoprecipitated recombinant proteins (using anti-FLAG) or the endogenous protein (using the mouse polyclonal anti-mTOR). Endogenous S6K1 and recombinant S6K1 were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-S6K1 antibody and the anti-Myc antibody, respectively. S6 kinase assays were carried out with the immune complexes using a peptide substrate as described previously (23Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Total RNA from a 60-mm plate of C2C12 cells was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 20 μg of RNA per lane were run on 0.8% formaldehyde agarose gels, followed by visualizing rRNAs by ethidium bromide staining and transferring to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were carried out in Church buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS) at 65 °C overnight, with a radioactive probe generated by random priming using a mouse mTOR cDNA 5′ fragment (nucleotide 1–698) as template. Membranes were washed in 40 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 5% SDS at 65 °C and analyzed by phosphorimaging. C2C12 myoblasts grown to 100% confluence in medium containing 20% FBS and 0.5% chicken embryo extract were induced to differentiate by serum withdrawal (2% horse serum). Typically, cell fusion and formation of small myofibers were evident 2 days after induction, and myofibers were fully formed in 3 days. When added at the beginning of induction, 20 nm rapamycin completely blocked C2C12 differentiation (Fig.1), consistent with observations reported by others (18Conejo R. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 20Cuenda A. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4341-4346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To assess the time window of the inhibitory effect of rapamycin, rapamycin was added at various time points or removed after certain periods. Myotube formation and the presence of MHC, a skeletal muscle marker, were examined 3–4 days after induction. As shown in Fig. 1, rapamycin effectively blocked terminal differentiation even when added as late as 36 h (1.5 days) after induction. After 2 days of differentiation induction, rapamycin addition no longer had any effect on the complete formation of myofibers. These observations imply that the rapamycin-sensitive pathway is required during the mid-phase of muscle differentiation. Because myogenin is an early differentiation marker for skeletal muscle (26Andres V. Walsh K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), and its production is inhibited by rapamycin in C2C12 cells (20Cuenda A. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4341-4346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), we further examined the effect of rapamycin during the early stage of differentiation. When cells were exposed to rapamycin during the first 24 h only, subsequent myofiber formation was delayed for at least 24 h (Fig. 1), suggesting that the rapamycin-sensitive pathway is also required for the early stage of myogenesis. Therefore, mTOR may be involved in regulating multiple events during muscle differentiation. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the rapamycin-sensitive pathway in C2C12 differentiation, we set out to determine the activity and phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1. As shown in Fig. 2A, S6K1 activity increased steadily during differentiation, and it was inhibited by rapamycin, consistent with previous reports in both C2C12 and L6A1 myoblasts (18Conejo R. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 20Cuenda A. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4341-4346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In contrast, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation monitored by gel mobility shift remained elevated (Fig. 2B). Both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 protein levels were unchanged during differentiation. Surprisingly, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation during the differentiation period was mostly resistant to rapamycin (up to 100 nm), whereas S6K1 activity was completely inhibited by 5 nm rapamycin (data not shown). Considering that 20 nm rapamycin is sufficient to abolish differentiation (Fig.1), 4E-BP1 is unlikely to be involved in the rapamycin-sensitive regulation of differentiation in C2C12 cells. S6K1, on the other hand, remains a candidate regulator of differentiation in the rapamycin-sensitive pathway. To gain further insight into the role of the rapamycin-sensitive pathway in myogenesis, we examined mTOR, the cellular target of rapamycin. The mTOR protein level increased drastically during differentiation (Fig.3A); when compared in the same number of cells, the amount of mTOR was 10-fold higher on day 3 of differentiation than on day 0 (Fig. 3B), whereas the increase of total cellular protein content was ∼1.5-fold. Thein vitro kinase activity of mTOR from myoblasts and differentiated cells was also compared. Although the total activity of mTOR increased upon differentiation, its specific activity did not increase (Fig. 3C). Northern analysis revealed that the mRNA level of mTOR remained constant during differentiation (Fig.3D). Thus, it is possible that mTOR, the master regulator of translation, may itself be regulated at the translational level during the transition from myoblasts to myotubes. However, a protein stability change has not been ruled out. To probe a direct link between mTOR function and myogenesis, we next asked whether a rapamycin-resistant mTOR could reverse the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on C2C12 differentiation. A point mutation, S2035T, confers rapamycin resistance to mTOR function by abolishing rapamycin binding to the FRB domain (15Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 27Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells transfected with various mTOR cDNAs constructed in pCDNA3 (under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter) were selected in G418-containing medium and induced to differentiate with or without the presence of rapamycin. As shown in Fig.4A, cells expressing the rapamycin-resistant mutant of mTOR differentiated in the presence of rapamycin, as indicated by the appearance of myofibers and the presence of MHC. Expression of the wild-type mTOR or transfection of the empty pCDNA3 vector did not protect C2C12 from the inhibitory effect of rapamycin. As further controls, transfection and G418 selection did not affect normal differentiation in the absence of rapamycin (Fig.4A). These observations provide the first direct evidence that mTOR is required for C2C12 myogenesis. Most unexpectedly, a kinase-inactive mutant (D2357E) of mTOR (15Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 23Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) containing the rapamycin-resistant mutation also fully rescued C2C12 myogenesis in the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 4A), clearly indicating that the myogenic function of mTOR does not require its kinase activity. This is the first example of a kinase-independent function conferred by a PIKK protein; until now, all the reported functions associated with each member of the PIKK family required catalytic activity of the kinase. Whether rapamycin inhibits mTOR kinase activity in vivo has been a controversial issue (discussed in Ref. 12Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar); our observation of the rapamycin-resistant and kinase-inactive mTOR behavior definitively dissociates the effect of rapamycin from mTOR kinase inhibition in myogenesis. The fact that differentiation proceeded normally in the presence of enough rapamycin to abolish S6K1 activity when a kinase-inactive and rapamycin-resistant mTOR is overexpressed, definitively indicates that S6K1 activity is not required for myogenesis. Consistently, a rapamycin-resistant S6K1 mutant (N-terminal 54 amino acids and C-terminal 104 amino acids deleted; see Ref. 25Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) was unable to reverse the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on C2C12 differentiation (Fig.4A). The rapamycin-resistant activity of this mutant was confirmed in C2C12 cells (Fig. 4B). A functional homologue of S6K1, S6K2, is another downstream effector of mTOR (reviewed in Ref.14Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. in Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 695-718Google Scholar) and has not been examined in this system. However, S6K2 activation also requires kinase activity of mTOR, 2I. Park and J. Chen, unpublished data. and thus is unlikely to be the relevant target of mTOR in myogenesis. What is the biological end point of mTOR pathway in myogenesis? Although the translational regulation of factors required for myogenesis is a possibility for mTOR function, the obvious candidate mediators of this function, S6Ks and 4E-BP1, have already been ruled out. In addition to translation, the yeast TOR proteins are involved in regulating other processes, including transcription and cytoskeleton reorganization (11Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Hence, it is conceivable that mTOR may regulate myogenesis via modulating cellular processes other than translation. Skeletal muscle differentiation involves several concerted and temporally separable events (26Andres V. Walsh K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The ability of rapamycin to inhibit more than one stage of the differentiation (Fig. 1) implies that mTOR may be involved in regulating multiple events of differentiation. Identification of the downstream effectors responsible for the myogenic signaling of mTOR will not only provide a better understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling myogenesis but also further unravel the multifunctionality of mTOR.

This disorder is characterized by chronic conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, impaired secretion of anionic conjugates from hepatocytes into bile, and deposition of a dark pigment in the liver. The specific amino acids in MRP2 involved in the recognition and transport of its substrates remain largely unknown, although two recent reports indicate that certain charged residues in or close to TM segments of the second and third MSDs are important (38Ryu S.

In a previous study of the related MRP1, we identified a highly conserved tryptophan residue in the last TM segment of MSD3, Trp1246, that is essential for the transport of E217βG, as well as for the ability to confer resistance to cationic and electroneutral natural product drugs (40Ito K.

In contrast to the effect on drug resistance and E217βG transport, we found that the variously substituted MRP1-Trp1246 mutants were capable of transporting LTC4 with only a modest decrease in affinity (Km) for this GSH conjugated substrate. 2K.

In the present study, we have mutated the analogous tryptophan residue in TM17 of MRP2, Trp1254 (see Fig. 1A), and show that all but the most conservative substitutions markedly reduce the ability of the protein to transport conjugated substrates in a way that differs quantitatively and qualitatively from comparable Trp1246mutants of MRP1. In addition, we have identified Trp1254 as being critical for the ability of MRP2 to transport MTX. [6,7-3H]E217βG (55 Ci mmol−1) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, [14,15(n)-3H]LTC4 (115.3 Ci mmol−1) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [3′,5′,7′-3H(n)]MTX sodium salt (17 Ci mmol−1) was from Moravek Inc. (Brea, CA). LTC4was purchased from CalBiochem (La Jolla, CA), and nucleotides, GSH, 2-mercaptoethanol, E217βG, sulfinpyrazone, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. To generate an MRP2 expression vector, a DNA fragment containing the complete coding sequence of human MRP2 mRNA with an optimized Kozak sequence was synthesized from several polymerase chain reaction products obtained from human A549 and HepG2 tumor cells and assembled in the vector pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The coding sequence of MRP2 cDNA was then moved into pcDNA3.1(−) (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the integrity of the resulting pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP2 vector was confirmed by sequencing the entire inserted sequence in both directions. The sequence obtained was in agreement with that published previously (GenBankTM accession number XP005809). The template for site-directed mutagenesis of Trp1254 of MRP2 was prepared by cloning a 2-kilobase XbaI fragment of MRP2 corresponding to nucleotides 2349–4404 into pGEM-3Z®. Mutagenesis was carried out using the TransformerTM kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following sense mutagenic primers (substituted nucleotides are underlined): W1254A (5′-CACAAACCCTGAACGCTTCTGGTGAGGATGAC-3′), W1254C (5′-CACAAACCCTGAACTGTCTGGTGAGGATGAC-3′), W1254F (5′-CACAAACCCTGAACTTTCTGGTGAGGATGAC-3′), and W1254Y (5′-CACAAACCCTGAACTATCTGGTGAGGATGAC-3′). After confirming all mutations by sequencing or diagnostic restriction enzyme digests, a 1.7-kilobase SfiI/Bsu36I fragment containing the desired mutation was subcloned back into pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP2, and the entire fragment in the full-length construct was sequenced again. Wild-type and mutant pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP2 expression vectors were transfected into SV40-transformed human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) as follows. Approximately 5 × 106cells were seeded in 175-cm2 flasks, and 24 h later, DNA (16 μg) was added using FuGENETM 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48–72 h, the HEK293T cells were harvested, and inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (18Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol.

Empty vector pcDNA3.1(−) DNA and vector containing the wild-type MRP2 cDNA were included as controls in all transfection experiments. The relative levels of wild-type and Trp1254mutant MRP2 proteins were determined by immunoblot analysis of membrane protein fractions from the transfected cells, essentially as described (40Ito K.

After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Pierce) followed by application of Renaissance® chemiluminescence blotting substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Relative levels of MRP2 protein expression were estimated by densitometric analysis using a ChemiImagerTM 4000 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from the transiently transfected HEK293T cells, and ATP-dependent transport of 3H-labeled substrates by the membrane vesicles was measured using a rapid filtration technique as described previously (18Loe D.W.

Briefly, E217βG transport assays were performed at 37 °C in a 60-μl reaction containing 400 nm[3H]E217βG (300 nCi), 4 mm AMP or ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, creatine phosphate (10 mm), creatine kinase (100 μg ml−1), and 8 μg of vesicle protein in transport buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4). In some experiments, sulfinpyrazone (100 μm) and MTX (500 and 1000 μm) were added. Uptake was stopped at 5 min by rapid dilution in ice-cold buffer, and then the reaction was filtered through glass fiber (Type A/E) filters that had been presoaked in transport buffer. Radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. All of the data were corrected for the amount of [3H]E217βG that remained bound to the filter, which was usually <10% of the total radioactivity. Transport in the presence of AMP was subtracted from transport in the presence of ATP to determine ATP-dependent E217βG uptake. All transport assays were carried out for time periods during which uptake was linear, based on preliminary time course studies. Thus transport activities represent initial rates. The assays were carried out in triplicate, and the results are expressed as the means ± S.D. Uptake of [3H]LTC4 was measured in a similar fashion except that membrane vesicles (8 μof g protein) were incubated at 23 °C for 3 min in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing [3H]LTC4 (50 nm; 40 nCi) and other components as described for [3H]E217βG transport. [3H]MTX uptake was also measured by rapid filtration essentially as described (8Hooijberg J.H. Broxterman H.J. Kool M. Assaraf Y.G. Peters G.J. Scheper R.J. Borst P. Pinedo H.M. Jansen G.

Acta. 1997; 1326: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The assays were performed at 37 °C in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 1 μm [3H]MTX (250 nCi/reaction), 50 mm HEPES/KOH buffer (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm AMP or ATP, an ATP-regenerating system, and membrane vesicles (12.5 μg of protein). Uptake was stopped at 10 min, diluted, and filtered as above for E217βG transport. We showed previously that both conservative and nonconservative substitutions of Trp1246 in MRP1 eliminated the E217βG transport activity of this protein (40Ito K. Olsen S.L. Qiu W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15616-15624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To determine whether MRP2-mediated E217βG transport activity would be similarly affected, cDNA constructs were generated in which several different amino acids were introduced in place of the analogous tryptophan residue in MRP2, Trp1254. These included nonconservative substitutions with a nonaromatic nonpolar amino acid (Ala; W1254A-MRP2) and a nonaromatic polar amino acid (Cys; W1254C-MRP2), as well as conservative substitutions with polar (Tyr; W1254Y-MRP2) and nonpolar (Phe; W1254F-MRP2) aromatic amino acids. The constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells, and after 48–72 h, the cells were harvested, the membrane vesicles were prepared, and relative MRP2 protein levels were determined by immunoblotting (41Leslie E.M.

Scheper R.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5269-5277PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, wild-type MRP2 and its four mutants (W1254A, W1254C, W1254Y, and W1254F) were all expressed in the HEK293T cells at comparable levels. Mean values of expression levels from four to six independent transfections relative to wild-type MRP2 were W1254A, 1.1; W1254C, 0.9; W1254F, 0.9; W1254Y, 1.0, respectively (Fig. 1B). ATP-dependent transport of [3H]E217βG was determined using the membrane vesicles prepared from the transfected HEK cells (Fig.2A). Like the nonconservatively substituted MRP1-Trp1246 mutants, the W1254A-MRP2 and W1254C-MRP2 mutants either did not transport or only very poorly transported [3H]E217βG (Fig.2B). However, E217βG transport by the W1254Y-MRP2 and W1254F-MRP2 mutants was similar to that of wild-type MRP2, in marked contrast to the comparable conservatively substituted MRP1-Trp1246 mutants, which were inactive for transport of this substrate (40Ito K. Olsen S.L. Qiu W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15616-15624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that the LTC4 transport capacity of the Trp1246 substituted MRP1 mutants remained intact although affinity (Km) for this glutathione conjugated substrate was modestly reduced compared with wild-type MRP1 (40Ito K. Olsen S.L. Qiu W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15616-15624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).2 In contrast, [3H]LTC4transport activity was essentially eliminated in vesicles containing three of the four MRP2-Trp1254 mutants, with levels of transport being comparable with those of vesicles prepared from control cells transfected with the empty pcDNA3.1(−) vector (Fig.2B). The [3H]LTC4 transport activity of the fourth and most conservatively substituted mutant, W1254Y-MRP2, was ∼40% of wild-type MRP2. It has been shown previously that LTC4 inhibits MRP2-mediated E217βG transport (39Ito K. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 44van Aubel R.A.M.H. van Kuijck M.A. Koenderink J.B. Deen P.M.T. van Os C.H. Russel F.G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1062-1067PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, to determine whether E217βG transport by a mutant MRP2 protein that no longer transports LTC4 could still be inhibited by this cysteinyl leukotriene, [3H]E217βG transport by the W1254F-MRP2 mutant was examined. As shown in Fig.3, LTC4 (1 μm) inhibited [3H]E217βG transport by wild-type MRP2 by ∼50% as expected. In contrast, LTC4 had no significant effect on [3H]E217βG transport by W1254F-MRP2, indicating that the loss of LTC4 transport by this mutant is associated with a loss of binding of this substrate. To determine whether the conservative and nonconservative Trp1254 substitutions might affect the transport of MRP2 substrates other than glutathione- and glucuronide-conjugated organic anions, [3H]MTX uptake was measured in membrane vesicles prepared from cells transfected with wild-type and mutant Trp1254 MRP2 cDNAs. As shown in Fig.4A, ATP-dependent [3H]MTX transport by wild-type MRP2 was readily detectable. In contrast, [3H]MTX transport by all four MRP2-Trp1254 mutant proteins was very low. After taking into account the different levels of MRP2 protein expression and subtracting the background transport activity of the membrane vesicles from the vector transfected control cells, the relative levels of [3H]MTX transport by the W1254A, W1254C, W1254F, and W1254Y mutants were 14, 14, 11, and 1%, respectively, of wild-type MRP2. Thus both conservative and nonconservative substitutions of Trp1254 essentially eliminated MTX transport by this ABCC transporter. It has previously been shown that MTX inhibits MRP2-mediated transport of the GSH-conjugated substrates, dinitrophenyl-glutathione andN-ethylmaleimide-glutathione (21Bakos E. Evers R. Sinkule J.A. Varadi A. Borst P. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 24Masuda M. I'izuka Y. Yamazaki M. Nishigaki R. Kato Y. Ni'inuma K. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3506-3510PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that MTX also inhibits E217βG transport. Thus [3H]E217βG transport by wild-type MRP2 was inhibited by ∼25 and 50% at concentrations of 500 and 1000 μm MTX, respectively (Fig. 4B). To determine whether E217βG transport by mutant MRP2 proteins that no longer transport MTX remained inhibitable by this antifolate, [3H]E217βG transport in membrane vesicles prepared from cells expressing W1254F-MRP2 and W1254Y-MRP2 was examined. In contrast to wild-type MRP2, MTX had no significant effect on [3H]E217βG transport by either W1254F-MRP2 or W1254Y-MRP2 at concentrations of either 500 or 1000 μm MTX (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the loss of MTX transport by MRP2-Trp1254 mutants is associated with a loss of binding of MTX to the protein. It has been reported previously that transport of GSH and glutathione conjugates by MRP2 can be markedly stimulated by several organic anions, including sulfinpyrazone (21Bakos E. Evers R. Sinkule J.A. Varadi A. Borst P. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 27Evers R. de Haas M. Sparidans R. Beijnen J. Wielinga P.R. Lankelma J.

During depolarization, Ca2+ entered preferentially through L-channels to induce necrotic or apoptotic cell death, depending on the duration of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) signal, as proven by the following. (i) The L-type Ca2+ channel activators Bay K 8644 and FPL64176, more than doubled the cytotoxic effects of 30 mmK+; (ii) the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine suppressed the cytotoxic effects of K+ alone or K+ plus FPL64176; (iii) the potentiation by FPL64176 of the K+-evoked [Ca2+]c elevation was totally suppressed by nimodipine. Cell exposure to K+ plus the L-type calcium channel agonist FPL64176 caused an initial peak rise followed by a sustained elevation of the [Ca2+]c that, in turn, increased [Ca2+]m and caused mitochondrial membrane depolarization.

At the moment, there are enough pieces of evidence that support the participation of Ca2+ entry through L-channels during ischemia, to cause cell death (13Mason R.P. Leeds P.R. Jacob R.F. Hough C.J.

However, the mechanism by which cell death is orchestrated by such Ca2+ entry has not been defined precisely. In this work, we attempt to clarify such a mechanism using the bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cell as a model. This cell expresses the same set of Ca2+ channel subtypes described in neurons (25Albillos A. Garcı́a A.G. Olivera B.M. Gandı́a L. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Bovine chromaffin cells in primary cultures constitute a homogeneous cell population that expresses various subtypes of Ca2+ channels at relative densities similar to certain types of neurons (i.e. granular cerebellar neurons (about 20% L-type, 30% N-type, and 50% P/Q-type) (26Tsien R.W. Ellinor P.T. Horne W.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 349-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar)). In addition, R-type channels have been recently discovered in chromaffin cells using the perforated configuration of the patch-clamp technique (27Albillos A. Neher E. Moser T. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8323-8330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, bovine chromaffin cells constitute an adequate model to investigate the problem posed here (i.e. (i) to know whether Ca2+ entry through these channels during sustained depolarization produced apoptotic cell death; (ii) to define why the L-channel pathway is more efficacious to activate this lethal signal; and (iii) to determine which is the role of mitochondria in the activation of cell death. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.; nimodipine, FPL64176, Bay K 8644, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were from Sigma; ω-conotoxin GVIA was from Bachem Feinchemikalien (Switzerland); and ω-conotoxin MVIIC and ω-agatoxin IVA were from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). The assay kit for measuring the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Cell Death Detection Elisaplus Kit were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Fura-2/AM, rhodamine 123, Vybrant Apoptosis Kit, and Mitotracker Red were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Concentrated solutions of drugs were prepared in water (ω-conotoxin GVIA, ω-conotoxin MVIIC, ω-agatoxin IVA, superoxide dismutase), dimethyl sulfoxide (nimodipine, FPL64176), or ethanol (Bay K 8644). Appropriate dilutions were then made in Krebs-Hepes solution containing 144 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 11 mm glucose, pH 7.3, titrated with NaOH. Me2SO, at the final concentration used (less than 0.1%), had no effect on any of the parameters tested. Bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells were isolated as previously described (28Livett B.G. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1103-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) with some modifications (29Moro M.A. López M.G. Gandı́a L. Michelena P. Garcı́a A.G. Anal.

To reduce the number of endothelial cells in the culture that could alter LDH measurements, cells were preplated for 30 min, and proliferation inhibitors (cytosine arabinoside, l-leucine methyl esther, and fluorodeoxyuridine) were used during the maintenance of the culture in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For cell death studies, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well on 24-well Orange plates coated with 0.01 mg ml−1 of poly-l-lysine, containing 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 10 µm cytosine arabinoside, 10 µmfluorodeoxyuridine, 10 µm leucine methyl esther, 50 IU ml−1 penicillin, and 50 µg ml−1streptomycin. Cultures were maintained for 2–3 days at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere with 5% CO2. After 24 h, the medium was replaced by 1 ml of serum-free fresh medium and subsequently changed every 2–3 days. Cells were normally used during days 2–3, to avoid excessive growth of endothelial cells that could interfere with LDH measurements. Extracellular and intracellular LDH activities were spectrophotometrically measured by following tetrazolium reduction at an absorbance wavelength of 492 nm. Total LDH activity was defined as the sum of intracellular plus extracellular LDH activity. Released LDH was defined as the percentage of extracellular compared with total LDH activity (30Cano-Abad M.F. López M.G. Hernández-Guijo J.M. Zapater P. Gandı́a L. Sánchez-Garcı́a P. Garcı́a A.G.

Henesley K. Butterfield D.A. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6239-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stained cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, removed from the well by gentle shaking, and placed in a plastic tube for centrifugation at 800 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were removed, and cells were resuspended in 50 µl of phosphate-buffered saline. A sample of 15 µl of the stained cells was placed on a coverslip and counted under the fluorescent microscope. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon Elipse TE300 microscope, using the appropriate filter for an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 465 nm. Nuclei with the apoptotic features were counted as apoptotic cells of a total of 300 cells in at least three different batches of cells. The percentage was calculated for each sample. For the quantitative determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments, the Cell Death Detection Elisaplus Kit was used (32Kapila Y.L. Wang S. Johnson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30906-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After induction of cell death, every well was treated with the lysis buffer for 30 min. Samples were spun down at 200 × g for 10 min. An aliquot from the supernatant (20 µl) was transferred to the streptavidin-coated microplate for analysis. 80 µl of the immunoreagent mixture prepared with 120 volume of anti-DNA-peroxidase and 120 volume of anti-histone-biotin with1820 volumes of incubation buffer were added to each well and maintained for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. Thereafter, the solution was removed by aspiration, and the wells were rinsed three times with 250 µl of incubation buffer. Then 100 µl of the substrate solution was added to each well and incubated for 5 min until the color developed. Measurements were made at 600 nm. Results were expressed as the absorbance of each sample and compared with basal levels. For these experiments, cells were plated on 1-cm diameter glass coverslips at a density of 5 × 104 cells/coverslip. Cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM (4 µm) for 45 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Hepes solution. Loading with the fluorescent dye was terminated by washing the coverslip containing the attached cells twice with Krebs-Hepes; then the cells were kept at room temperature for 15 min before placing them in the headstage of a Nikon Diaphot microscope to measure their fluorescence. The fluorescence of Fura-2 in single cells was measured with the photomultiplier-based system (33Neher E. Sellin L.P. Libelius R. Thesleff S. Neuromuscular Junction. Elsevier, Amsterdam1989: 65-76Google Scholar), which produces a spatially averaged measurement of the [Ca2+]c. Fura-2 was excited with light alternating between 360 and 390 nm, using a Nikon × 40 fluorite objective. Emitted light was transmitted through a 425-nm dichroic mirror and 500–545-nm barrier filter before being detected by the photomultiplier. [Ca2+]c was calculated from the ratios of the light emitted when the dye was excited by the two alternating excitation wavelengths (34Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of rhodamine 123 was used to measure ΔΨm (35Mattson M.P. Zhang Y. Bose S. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 121 (c): 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of 10 µm of the dye. Rhodamine 123 was added to all of the solutions used during the experiment, in order to avoid washout of the dye. Three to six cells were studied in each experiment. Images were collected at 1 image/0.372 s. Cellular fluorescence was imaged using a MRC 6000 confocal laser-scanning microscope with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510 nm and a × 60 oil immersion objective. Pixel intensity/cell was determined using Bio-Rad software. Base-line fluorescence (Fo) was measured as normalized fluorescence emitted during the experiment. Increments in fluorescence indicate mitochondrial depolarization. All experiments were performed at 22 ± 1 °C in bovine chromaffin cells cultured for 2–3 days. Cells were placed in coverslips at a density of 3 × 105 cells. Control and treated cells (0.3 µm FPL64176, 30 mmK+, 5 mm Ca2+) were loaded with the cell-permeant mitochondrial dye, Mitotracker red 100 nm at 37 °C for 30 min. Once the Mitotracker probe accumulates in mitochondria, it reacts with accessible thiol groups of peptides and proteins and forms an aldehyde conjugate that is stable. Fluorescent images were taken under a confocal laser-scanning microscope with excitation at 570 nm and emission at 599 nm (36Krajeweski S. Krajeweski M. Ellerby L.M. Welsh K. Xie Z. Deverausx Q.L.

For instance, in the experiment shown in Fig. 1 a, cells were incubated in Krebs-Hepes solution containing increasing concentrations of KCl (5.9–50 mm), with isosmotic reduction of NaCl, for 24 h at 37 °C. At the end of this incubation period, the medium was collected to measure LDH released from dead cells (extracellular LDH; LDHe); the cells that remained attached to the well were then lysed, and their LDH content was measured. The expression of LDHe as a percentage of total LDH provides an indication of the fraction of cells dying as a consequence of a given treatment, in this case depolarization of increasing strengths. Incubation of the cells for 24 h with increasing [K+]e gave a gradual release of LDHe; maximum cell damage was observed at 30 mm K+, which caused 25% cell loss; a further increase to 50 mm K+ did not enhance cell death. Hence, 30 mm [K+]e was chosen to perform subsequent experiments. Cell damage was not only a function of the degree of VDCC opened upon depolarization with high [K+]e but also of the quantity of external Ca2+ offered to the cells ([Ca2+]e). In a second experiment (Fig.1 b), the effects of increasing [Ca2+]eon cell death, at a fixed level of depolarization (30 mmK+), were assayed. Cell death after a 24-h incubation was close to basal at 0.2–0.5 mm [Ca2+]e(13% LDHe release); at 2–10 mm[Ca2+]e, cell death increased to around 25%, and it declined to 20% at 20 mm [Ca2+]e; this effect could be due to inactivation by excess Ca2+ of VDCC (38Villarroya M.

Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3284-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To increase the cell damage caused by Ca2+ entry through L-type VDCC, we used different L-type agonists like FPL64176, (+)Bay K 8644, and (−)Bay K 8644 (41Garcı́a A.G. Sala F. Reig J.A. Viniegra S. Frias J. Fonterı́z R. Gandı́a L. Nature. 1984; 309: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) under mild depolarizing conditions (30 mm [K+]e) for 24 h. Fig.1 c shows the cytotoxic consequence of the incubation with these agonists at concentrations that ranged from 0.3 to 10 µm. Maximum cytotoxic effects, for all drugs tested, were observed at 0.3–1 µm; higher concentrations of the agonists (3–10 µm) presented a decrease in LDHe; this effect can be explained by their Ca2+ antagonist action at high concentrations (41Garcı́a A.G. Sala F. Reig J.A. Viniegra S. Frias J. Fonterı́z R. Gandı́a L. Nature. 1984; 309: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 42Fonterı́z R.I. Gandı́a L. López M.G. Artalejo C.R. Garcı́a A.G. Brain Res. 1987; 408: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Out of the three L-type agonists used, FPL64176 presented the highest cytotoxic effects. Therefore, the combination of 0.3 µmFPL64176 in 30 mm [K+]e was used to induce cell death via Ca2+ entry through L-type VDCC. The cytotoxic effect of Ca2+ entry through L-channels induced by FPL64176 was dependent on the [Ca2+]e. In Fig. 1 d, basal LDHe (24-h incubation in 5.9 mm K+) amounted to 8.4 ± 0.9%; 0.3 µm FPL64176 in the presence of 30 mmK+ increased the basal LDHe at all [Ca2+]e studied. For instance, at 0.2 mm [Ca2+]e, LDHeincreased from 12.3 ± 2.6% (Fig. 1 b) to 25.9 ± 2.6% in the presence of FPL. Maximum cell death was achieved in the presence of 5–10 mm [Ca2+]e(41.5 ± 2.0 and 43.5 ± 1.8%, respectively). It is interesting that this sharp increase in cell death could be completely reversed by a 1 µm concentration of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine (Fig. 1 d); LDHe after 24 h was in the range of 10–15% (i.e. similar to that found in basal conditions (5.9 mm K+)). It is worth noting that nimodipine counteracted both the LDHe increase evoked by 30 mm K+ in the absence (about 25%) and in the presence of FPL64176 (about 50%), suggesting that the increase in cell death was associated to increased Ca2+ entry mostly through L-type Ca2+ channels. Since cell damage caused by depolarization was minimum at 0.2 mm [Ca2+]e and maximum at 5 mm [Ca2+]e, we selected these extreme [Ca2+]e values to analyze the time course of the [Ca2+]c signals in Fura-2-loaded single cells exposed to 30 mm K+. Cells superfused with 0.2 mm [Ca2+]e gave an average initial basal [Ca2+]c of 55 ± 4.8 nm. Exposure to 30 mmK+, 0.2 mm Ca2+ caused an initial mean peak of 198 ± 39 nm (n = 8) (Fig. 3 a). Despite the sustained depolarization with K+, the [Ca2+]c peak declined quickly to basal levels and remained stable along the rest of the 30-min period of recording. In 5 mm [Ca2+]e, the resting [Ca2+]c was 61 ± 5.9 nm (n = 7); upon superfusion with 30 mm K+, 0.2 mmCa2+, an initial [Ca2+]c peak of 560 ± 45 nm was reached (n = 7); then the peak [Ca2+]c declined gradually and reached a stable plateau of 242 ± 79 nm. The transient nature of the [Ca2+]c signal was probably due to voltage- and [Ca2+]c-dependent inactivation of Ca2+ channels upon sustained cell depolarization (38Villarroya M. Olivares R. Ruiz A.

A. 1993; 90: 3284-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This transient response of [Ca2+]c might explain the scarce cell damage observed in the experiments of Fig.1 b. Hence, we tried to delay the inactivation of Ca2+ channels by using the L-type Ca2+ channel activator FPL64176. In the presence of 0.3 µm FPL64176, 30 mm K+, 0.2 mmCa2+, the initial peak of [Ca2+]c reached 432 ± 130 nm(n = 4) and then declined to reach a stable Ca2+ entry of 299 ± 8 nm. Thus, FPL64176 converted the [Ca2+]c signal obtained in 0.2 mm [Ca2+]e into a response similar to that produced by 5 mm [Ca2+]e. When FPL64176 was applied in the presence of high [Ca2+]e (5 mm), the [Ca2+]c rose initially to a peak of 905 ± 120 nm (n = 9) and then declined to a sustained plateau that was 1.4-fold higher (409 ± 91 nm) than in low [Ca2+]e (0.2 mm), along the rest of the 30-min depolarization period (Fig. 2d). When measuring the total quantity of Ca2+ entering the cells during the 30-min exposure period in low (0.2 mm) or high (5 mm) [Ca2+]e in the presence or absence of FPL64176, we observed that the maximum levels of [Ca2+]c were achieved when using 5 mm[Ca2+]e plus FPL64176 (496 ± 77 nm·s) (n = 8). Ca2+ entry at 0.2 mm [Ca2+]e plus FPL64176 and 5 mm [Ca2+]e alone were rather similar, 317 ± 8 nm·s (n = 4) and 302 ± 62 nm·s (n = 8), respec"

The mode of action of PZQ is not known, although initial effects of the drug include a rapid influx of calcium (Ca2+) into the worm and a Ca2+-dependent muscle contraction and paralysis (reviewed in Refs. 1Redman C.A.

Voltage-gated Ca2+channels represent a possible site of action for this drug, but this hypothesis has not been tested directly because of the inability to date to record robust Ca2+ currents from schistosomes.Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are heteromultimeric membrane protein complexes consisting of a pore-forming, voltage-sensing α1 subunit that is modulated by β, α2-δ, and other auxiliary subunits (reviewed in Ref.4Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). Previously we have cloned three high voltage-activated Ca2+ channel α1 subunit cDNAs fromSchistosoma mansoni (5Kohn A.B. Lea J.M. Roberts-Misterly J. Anderson P.A.V. Greenberg R.M. Parasitology, in press. 2001; 273Google Scholar). Here, we report the cloning and expression of two Ca2+ channel β subunits fromSchistosoma japonicum and S. mansoni. These schistosome β subunits (SmCavβA andSjCavβ) have novel structural features and unusual modulatory effects on α1 subunits. Furthermore, coexpression of either of these two β subunits with mammalian Cav2.3 (α1E) confers PZQ sensitivity to this otherwise PZQ-insensitive α1 subunit.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe the cloning and functional expression of Ca2+ channel β subunit cDNAs from two schistosome species. Both of these β subunits have unusual structural features compared with other known β subunits. Furthermore, in contrast to other known β subunits, coexpression of these schistosome β subunits with two different α1 subunits results in a dramatic decrease in current amplitude. Finally, coexpression of the PZQ-insensitive Cav2.3 with either of these schistosome β subunits results in an expressed current that is sensitive to PZQ, indicating that these β subunits, in combination with particular α1 subunits, may be important molecular targets of PZQ action.β subunits modulate high voltage-activated α1 subunits in several typical ways (reviewed in Refs. 9Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar and 10Birnbaumer L. Qin N. Olcese R. Tareilus E. Platano D. Costantin J. Stefani E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These include increasing peak current amplitude, shifting activation in a hyperpolarizing direction, changing inactivation kinetics, and changing the rate of recovery from inactivation (11Jeziorski M.C. Greenberg R.M. Anderson P.A.V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). β subunits are also likely required for proper assembly of mature channels in the membrane. These effects are found even when coexpressing α1 and β subunits from widely divergent phyla (12Jeziorski M.C. Greenberg R.M. Anderson P.A.V. Receptors Channels. 1999; 6: 375-386PubMed Google Scholar, 13Grabner M. Wang Z. Mitterdorfer J. Rosenthal F. Charnet P. Savchenko A. Hering S. Ren D. Hall L.M. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23668-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The two schistosome β subunits we describe here clearly modulate α1 subunits in an unusual manner. Instead of increasing current amplitude as other β subunits do, these β subunits dramatically decrease amplitude of currents expressed inXenopus oocytes. An explanation for this unusual effect may reside within the BID. Both of these schistosome β subunits lack two conserved serines within their BIDs. These serines are consensus protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. Mutation of one of these serines (Fig. 1B, *) to arginine in the β1b subunit results in a reduced enhancement of current amplitude with no detectable effect on α1/β binding (8De Waard M.D. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Perhaps the loss of both serines in these schistosome β subunits results in an even more dramatic effect on current amplitude. Other modulatory effects of these β subunits on α1 subunits are similar to those found for other β subunits, indicating that the reduction in current is likely not the result of some nonspecific interaction.Perhaps most interestingly, both of these schistosome β subunits appear to confer PZQ sensitivity to an otherwise insensitive mammalian channel. Coexpression of either of these β subunits with human Cav2.3 results in a significant increase in voltage-gated current amplitude in the presence of the drug. Besides potentially providing insight into the mode of PZQ action, this result also indicates that the reduction in current amplitude induced by schistosome β subunits cannot be explained entirely by a defect in channel assembly. Clearly, channels appear to be present in the membrane but are either not gating currents or are gating reduced currents. In this cross-species heteromer, PZQ appears to partially reverse this inhibitory effect.These schistosome β subunits are likely competing with the endogenous β subunit found in Xenopus oocytes (14Tareilus E. Roux M. Qin N. Olcese R. Zou J. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) for binding to expressed α1 subunits. Indeed, we have preliminary data from coexpression experiments (not shown) indicating that these schistosome β subunits compete with other expressed β subunits in a concentration-dependent manner to modulate α1subunits.Interestingly, PZQ-sensitive currents do not result when the jellyfish L-type α1 subunit (CyCav1) is coexpressed with SjCavβ orSmCavβA. There are at least two possible explanations for this difference. First, it may reflect some subtle distinction in the interaction of L-type (CyCav1) and non L-type (Cav2.3) α1 subunits with these schistosome β subunits or with PZQ. Vertebrate non-L-type Cav2.1 and Cav2.3 α1 subunits have been shown to contain a secondary β subunit interaction domain at the C terminus (14Tareilus E. Roux M. Qin N. Olcese R. Zou J. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Walker D. Bichet D. Campbell K.P. De Waard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2361-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Second, it is possible that the difference reflects structural motifs that are common to Cav2.3 and, presumably, schistosome α1subunits but not found in CyCav1. These differences would be independent of whether the channel is L-type or non-L-type. For example, schistosome and other flatworm L-type α1 subunits have a non-charged residue at a conserved negatively charged site in the Domain I pore region (5Kohn A.B. Lea J.M. Roberts-Misterly J. Anderson P.A.V. Greenberg R.M. Parasitology, in press. 2001; 273Google Scholar). Cav2.3, but not CyCav1, also has a non-charged residue at that site. These and other hypotheses are currently being tested.The results presented here suggest a model for PZQ action that is consistent with the observed effects of PZQ on Ca2+homeostasis in schistosomes. These unusual schistosome β subunits presumably inhibit currents through those schistosome α1subunits with which they are associated. We speculate that PZQ may disrupt this α1/β interaction in these channels, thereby either allowing more channels to open or allowing more current to flow through individual channels. As a consequence, normal Ca2+ homeostasis is disrupted. We are currently testing the effects of PZQ directly on schistosome Ca2+ channels expressed in a heterologous system. Eventually, recording of currents through single channels will refine this model, and coexpression of different combinations of schistosome α1 and β subunits will be used to test it more rigorously.Interestingly, we have cloned a third schistosome β subunit (SmCavβB) that more closely resembles other β subunits in its structure. We would expect that these two (or more?) types of schistosome β subunits may have characteristic patterns of expression in the worm and may have distinct modulatory effects on the different schistosome α1 subunits. Praziquantel (PZQ)1 is the drug of choice against schistosomiasis, a debilitating disease caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma. The mode of action of PZQ is not known, although initial effects of the drug include a rapid influx of calcium (Ca2+) into the worm and a Ca2+-dependent muscle contraction and paralysis (reviewed in Refs. 1Redman C.A.

Voltage-gated Ca2+channels represent a possible site of action for this drug, but this hypothesis has not been tested directly because of the inability to date to record robust Ca2+ currents from schistosomes. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are heteromultimeric membrane protein complexes consisting of a pore-forming, voltage-sensing α1 subunit that is modulated by β, α2-δ, and other auxiliary subunits (reviewed in Ref.4Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). Previously we have cloned three high voltage-activated Ca2+ channel α1 subunit cDNAs fromSchistosoma mansoni (5Kohn A.B. Lea J.M. Roberts-Misterly J. Anderson P.A.V. Greenberg R.M. Parasitology, in press. 2001; 273Google Scholar). Here, we report the cloning and expression of two Ca2+ channel β subunits fromSchistosoma japonicum and S. mansoni. These schistosome β subunits (SmCavβA andSjCavβ) have novel structural features and unusual modulatory effects on α1 subunits. Furthermore, coexpression of either of these two β subunits with mammalian Cav2.3 (α1E) confers PZQ sensitivity to this otherwise PZQ-insensitive α1 subunit. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe the cloning and functional expression of Ca2+ channel β subunit cDNAs from two schistosome species. Both of these β subunits have unusual structural features compared with other known β subunits. Furthermore, in contrast to other known β subunits, coexpression of these schistosome β subunits with two different α1 subunits results in a dramatic decrease in current amplitude. Finally, coexpression of the PZQ-insensitive Cav2.3 with either of these schistosome β subunits results in an expressed current that is sensitive to PZQ, indicating that these β subunits, in combination with particular α1 subunits, may be important molecular targets of PZQ action.β subunits modulate high voltage-activated α1 subunits in several typical ways (reviewed in Refs. 9Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar and 10Birnbaumer L. Qin N. Olcese R. Tareilus E. Platano D. Costantin J. Stefani E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These include increasing peak current amplitude, shifting activation in a hyperpolarizing direction, changing inactivation kinetics, and changing the rate of recovery from inactivation (11Jeziorski M.C. Greenberg R.M. Anderson P.A.V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). β subunits are also likely required for proper assembly of mature channels in the membrane. These effects are found even when coexpressing α1 and β subunits from widely divergent phyla (12Jeziorski M.C. Greenberg R.M. Anderson P.A.V. Receptors Channels. 1999; 6: 375-386PubMed Google Scholar, 13Grabner M. Wang Z. Mitterdorfer J. Rosenthal F. Charnet P. Savchenko A. Hering S. Ren D. Hall L.M. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23668-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The two schistosome β subunits we describe here clearly modulate α1 subunits in an unusual manner. Instead of increasing current amplitude as other β subunits do, these β subunits dramatically decrease amplitude of currents expressed inXenopus oocytes. An explanation for this unusual effect may reside within the BID. Both of these schistosome β subunits lack two conserved serines within their BIDs. These serines are consensus protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. Mutation of one of these serines (Fig. 1B, *) to arginine in the β1b subunit results in a reduced enhancement of current amplitude with no detectable effect on α1/β binding (8De Waard M.D. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Perhaps the loss of both serines in these schistosome β subunits results in an even more dramatic effect on current amplitude. Other modulatory effects of these β subunits on α1 subunits are similar to those found for other β subunits, indicating that the reduction in current is likely not the result of some nonspecific interaction.Perhaps most interestingly, both of these schistosome β subunits appear to confer PZQ sensitivity to an otherwise insensitive mammalian channel. Coexpression of either of these β subunits with human Cav2.3 results in a significant increase in voltage-gated current amplitude in the presence of the drug. Besides potentially providing insight into the mode of PZQ action, this result also indicates that the reduction in current amplitude induced by schistosome β subunits cannot be explained entirely by a defect in channel assembly. Clearly, channels appear to be present in the membrane but are either not gating currents or are gating reduced currents. In this cross-species heteromer, PZQ appears to partially reverse this inhibitory effect.These schistosome β subunits are likely competing with the endogenous β subunit found in Xenopus oocytes (14Tareilus E. Roux M. Qin N. Olcese R. Zou J. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) for binding to expressed α1 subunits. Indeed, we have preliminary data from coexpression experiments (not shown) indicating that these schistosome β subunits compete with other expressed β subunits in a concentration-dependent manner to modulate α1subunits.Interestingly, PZQ-sensitive currents do not result when the jellyfish L-type α1 subunit (CyCav1) is coexpressed with SjCavβ orSmCavβA. There are at least two possible explanations for this difference. First, it may reflect some subtle distinction in the interaction of L-type (CyCav1) and non L-type (Cav2.3) α1 subunits with these schistosome β subunits or with PZQ. Vertebrate non-L-type Cav2.1 and Cav2.3 α1 subunits have been shown to contain a secondary β subunit interaction domain at the C terminus (14Tareilus E. Roux M. Qin N. Olcese R. Zou J. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Walker D. Bichet D. Campbell K.P. De Waard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2361-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Second, it is possible that the difference reflects structural motifs that are common to Cav2.3 and, presumably, schistosome α1subunits but not found in CyCav1. These differences would be independent of whether the channel is L-type or non-L-type. For example, schistosome and other flatworm L-type α1 subunits have a non-charged residue at a conserved negatively charged site in the Domain I pore region (5Kohn A.B. Lea J.M. Roberts-Misterly J. Anderson P.A.V. Greenberg R.M. Parasitology, in press. 2001; 273Google Scholar). Cav2.3, but not CyCav1, also has a non-charged residue at that site. These and other hypotheses are currently being tested.The results presented here suggest a model for PZQ action that is consistent with the observed effects of PZQ on Ca2+homeostasis in schistosomes. These unusual schistosome β subunits presumably inhibit currents through those schistosome α1subunits with which they are associated. We speculate that PZQ may disrupt this α1/β interaction in these channels, thereby either allowing more channels to open or allowing more current to flow through individual channels. As a consequence, normal Ca2+ homeostasis is disrupted. We are currently testing the effects of PZQ directly on schistosome Ca2+ channels expressed in a heterologous system.

https://openalex.org/W2093551073,"Cytokine receptors consist of multiple subunits, which are often shared between different receptors, resulting in the functional redundancy sometimes observed between cytokines. The interleukin 5 (IL-5) receptor consists of an IL-5-specific alpha-subunit (IL-5Ralpha) and a signal-transducing beta-subunit (betac) shared with the IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors. In this study, we sought to find a role for the cytoplasmic domain of IL-5Ralpha. We show that syntenin, a protein containing PSD-95/Discs large/zO-1 (PDZ) domains, associates with the cytoplasmic tail of the IL-5Ralpha. Syntenin was found to directly associate with the transcription factor Sox4. Association of syntenin with IL-5Ralpha was required for IL-5-mediated activation of Sox4. These studies identify a mechanism of transcriptional activation by cytokine-specific receptor subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1601014761,"We recently demonstrated that in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, insulin promoted the phosphorylation and activation of geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTI-I), increased the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rho-A and potentiated the transactivating activity of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (Chappell, J., Golovchenko, I., Wall, K., Stjernholm, R., Leitner, J., Goalstone, M., and Draznin, B. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 31792–31797). In the present study, we explored the mechanism of this potentiating effect of insulin on LPA. Insulin (10 nm) potentiated the ability of LPA to stimulate cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cells. The potentiating effect of insulin appears to involve increases in the expression of cyclin E and decreases in the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. All potentiating effects of insulin were inhibited in the presence of an inhibitor of GGTase I, GGTI-286 (3 μm) or by an expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rho-A. In contrast to its potentiating action, a direct mitogenic effect of insulin in MCF-7 cells involves activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and increased expression of cyclin D1. We conclude that the ability of insulin to increase the cellular amounts of geranylgeranylated Rho-A results in potentiation of the LPA effect on cyclin E expression and degradation of p27Kip1 and cell cycle progression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We recently demonstrated that in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, insulin promoted the phosphorylation and activation of geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTI-I), increased the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rho-A and potentiated the transactivating activity of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (Chappell, J., Golovchenko, I., Wall, K., Stjernholm, R., Leitner, J., Goalstone, M., and Draznin, B.

We have recently demonstrated in a MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, that insulin promoted the phosphorylation and activation of GGTase I (25Chappell J. Golovchenko I. Wall K. Stjernholm R. Leitner J. Goalstone M. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31792-31797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Increases in the GGTase I activity resulted in significant augmentation of the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rho-A in the insulin-treated cells and potentiation of the nuclear effects ofl-α-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). In the present experiments, we explore the mechanism of the potentiating effect of insulin on LPA-induced cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Tissue culture media was from Meditech, Inc. (Herndon, VA). Gentamicin was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Fetal calf serum was from Gemini Bio-Products, Inc. (Calabasas, CA). Bovine serum albumin, LPA, and other biochemicals were from Sigma. Insulin was from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). Anti-cyclin E and anti-cyclin D1 mouse monoclonal antibodies and geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor-286 (GGTI-286) were from Calbiochem (San Diego). Anti-p27 and Anti-retinoblastoma (Rb) mouse monoclonal antibodies, protein G-plus/protein A-agarose and immunoprecipitation reagents were from Oncogene Science, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Bicinchoninic acid Protein Assay Kit was from Pierce. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis supplies and reagents were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). MCF-7 breast cancer cells were a gift from Dr. Carla L. Van Den Berg (University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, CO), and a dominant negative mutant of Rho-A was a gift from Dr. J. J. Baldassare (St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO), and BrdUrd Cell Proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. MCF-7 cells were grown to 80% confluence at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in improved minimal essential media + 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, l-glutamine (200 mm), and insulin (60 pm). The cells were serum- and insulin-starved for 24 h and then preincubated with insulin (10 nm) for 24 h with and without 3 μmGGTI-286, 100 nm wortmannin, or 20 μmPD98059. Cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h with LPA (20 μm). Cells were lifted from the plates using 2 ml Versene 1:5000 (Life Technologies, Inc.), pelleted in 1× phosphate buffered saline, and stained with propidium iodide using the method of Krishan (33Krishan A. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Alignment of the instrument was verified daily using DNA check beads (Coulter). Peakversus integral gating was used to exclude doublet events from the analysis. Data were collected for 10,000 events. Modfit LT (Verity Software House, Topsham, MA) was used for cell cycle modeling. MCF-7 cells were grown to 80% confluence in 96-well plates as described above. The cells were serum- and insulin-starved for 24 h and then preincubated with insulin (10 nm) for 24 h with and without 3 μm GGTI-286. Cells were then incubated for an additional 8 h with LPA (20 μm) in the presence of 10 μl of BrdUrd (diluted 1:100 in serum-free medium). Labeling medium was removed and BrdUrd incorporation was determined by cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, visualized, and quantified by colorimetry. MCF-7 cells were grown to 80% confluence as described above. The cells were serum- and insulin-starved for 24 h and then preincubated with insulin (10 nm) for 24 h with and without 3 μmGGTI-286. Cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h with LPA (20 μm). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using a Triton X-100-based lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm Na vanadate, 0.05% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), sonicated, and centrifuged, and protein concentrations were diluted to 1 mg/ml. Cyclin E and cyclin D1 protein were immunoprecipitated using the respective antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, determined by Western blot, and quantitated by densitometry. MCF-7 cells were grown to 80% confluence as described above. The cells were serum- and insulin-starved for 24 h and then preincubated with insulin (10 nm) for 24 h with and without 3 μmGGTI-286. Cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h with LPA (20 μm). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed as above, sonicated, and centrifuged, and protein concentrations were diluted to 1 mg/ml. p27Kip1 and Rb protein were immunoprecipitated using the respective antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, determined by Western blot and quantitated by densitometry. For the assessment of Rb phosphorylation, the Western blot of the Rb immunoprecipitates was performed using anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibody. Statistics were analyzed by Student's paired or unpaired t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Because our recently published observations (35Jackson J. White M. Yee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9994-10003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) indicated that hyperinsulinemia potentiates the nuclear effects of LPA by increasing the availability of geranylgeranylated Rho-A, the current experiments were performed to further elucidate the mechanism of the potentiating influence of insulin on growth of MCF-7 cells. In the initial experiments, we examined the direct effects of insulin on MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation by florescence activated cell cycle analysis. Insulin (10 nm) enhanced cell growth by ∼40% over control when supplemented in serum free medium (Fig.1). The effect of insulin was dose-dependent, with 100 nm insulin enhancing growth by 70% (not shown). Addition of wortmannin (100 nm), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), completely blocked the mitogenic effect of insulin, whereas the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (20 μm) had no significant effect on insulin-induced growth (Fig. 1). Thus, these experiments confirmed that the direct mitogenic action of insulin in MCF-7 cells is dependent upon the PI 3-kinase branch of insulin's intracellular signaling (34Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H. van Schaik F. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P. Sussenbach J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 35Jackson J. White M. Yee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9994-10003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Because the effect of insulin on GGTase I and geranylgeranylation of Rho-A is mediated by the Shc-Ras-MAP kinase pathway and is completely independent of PI 3-kinase signaling (36Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Berhanu P Sharma P.G. Olefsky J.M. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12805-12812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), these cells serve as an excellent model to examine the mechanism of the potentiating influence of insulin independent of its direct mitogenic action, which is PI-3-kinase-dependent. We then examined the potentiating effect of insulin on the mitogenic action of LPA. Insulin (10 nm) alone showed the same 40% increase in growth over control, whereas LPA (20 μm) enhanced MCF-7 cell growth 5% over control (Fig.2). When LPA was added to MCF-7 cells, which were preincubated with 10 nm insulin for 24 h, growth was enhanced to 65% over control. This potentiating effect of insulin was blocked by the addition of the geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor GGTI-286 (3 μm). GGTI-286 had no effect on insulin alone (data not shown). While addition of wortmannin completely blocked the effect of insulin (Fig. 1), it did not affect the ability of insulin to potentiate LPA action to ∼25% above controlversus 5% with LPA alone (Fig. 2). These findings indicate that the potentiating effect of insulin is not dependent on PI 3-kinase. Finally, addition of GGTI to insulin, LPA, and wortmannin completely blocked the potentiating effect of insulin. BrdUrd incorporation into DNA is another marker of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Therefore, we examined the ability of insulin to potentiate the effect of LPA on BrdUrd incorporation in MCF-7 cells. Insulin alone increased BrdUrd incorporation into DNA 18% above control (Fig. 3), whereas LPA alone increased BrdUrd incorporation by 7%. When LPA was added to cells, which were preincubated with 10 nm insulin, BrdUrd incorporation into DNA was enhanced to 27%. If insulin potentiates the effect of LPA by increasing the availability of prenylated Rho-A, then inhibition of geranylgeranylation of Rho-A should block the potentiating effect of insulin. Indeed, addition of GGTI-286 to the preincubation medium blocked the potentiating effect of insulin, significantly decreasing the incorporation of BrdUrd as compared with the cells incubated with insulin and LPA. BrdUrd incorporation in cells incubated with insulin in combination with 3 μm GGTI-286 was not significantly different from that observed in experiments with insulin alone (not shown). To confirm the role of Rho-A in mediating the potentiating effect of insulin, cells were transiently transfected with a dominant negative mutant of Rho-A prior to the insulin and LPA challenges. Expression of a dominant negative Rho-A completely blocked the ability of insulin to potentiate the effect of LPA on BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 3), without any effect on insulin alone. Because flow cytometry and BrdUrd incorporation represent surrogate measures of mitogenesis, we performed direct cell count of MCF-7 cells exposed to insulin and LPA (Fig.3B). We observed a synergistic effect of insulin and LPA on cell growth that was completely abolished in the presence of either a GGTase I inhibitor or a dominant negative mutant of Rho-A. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the potentiating effect of insulin is related to the ability of insulin to activate GGTase I, while its direct effect is independent of its action on prenylation. To assess whether an introduction of a dominant negative Rho-A could squelch the signal transduction proteins, we examined the effect of insulin on the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and Akt in control and transfected MCF-7 cells. Transfection of a dominant negative Rho-A had no effect on the ability of insulin to stimulate the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and Akt (not shown), suggesting normal functioning of signaling pathways in these cells. Because insulin increased the progression of MCF-7 cells into cell cycle and potentiated the mitogenic effect of LPA, we examined the effect of 10 nm insulin on cell cycle initiation by evaluating its effect on cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression. The aim of these experiments was to identify the point in the initiation of the cell cycle that is potentiated by insulin. Insulin (10 nm) stimulated cyclin D1 production ∼30% over control, whereas LPA (20 μm) alone did not stimulate cyclin D1 production over control (Fig.4A). However, insulin did not potentiate the effect of LPA on cyclin D1. In cells preincubated with 10 nm insulin and then exposed to 20 μm LPA, cyclin D1 production was not significantly different from that seen in the cells incubated with LPA alone. In contrast to the experiments with cyclin D1, insulin (10 nm) alone showed no significant stimulatory effect on cyclin E production, whereas LPA (20 μm) stimulated cyclin E production almost 2-fold (Fig. 4B). However, preincubation of MCF-7 cells with 10 nm insulin significantly increased the LPA-stimulated cyclin E production to more than 3-fold as compared with controls. This potentiating effect of insulin was completely abolished with the addition of 3 μm GGTI-286 or by a transient transfection of a dominant negative mutant of Rho-A (Fig. 4B), again suggesting that the potentiating influence of insulin is mediated by its effect on GGTase I. Because the function of cyclin E is partly regulated by its interactions with the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27Kip1(reviewed in Refs. 37Gitig D. Koff A. Meth. Mol. Biol. 2000; 142: 109-123PubMed Google Scholar and 38Sherr C. Roberts J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5131) Google Scholar) and because Rho-A stimulates p27Kip1 degradation through its regulation of cyclin E-Cdk 2 activity (39Hu W. Bellone C. Baldassare J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3396-3401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we examined insulin's effect on p27Kip1expression in MCF-7 cells. Either insulin (10 nm) or LPA (20 μm) alone showed a mild and non-significant inhibitory effect on p27Kip1 production. However, when LPA (20 μm) was added to MCF-7 cells preincubated with 10 nm insulin for 24 h, p27Kip1 production was significantly decreased by 33% (p < 0.04) (Fig.5). The presence of GGTI-286 or transfection of a dominant negative Rho-A completely abrogated a decrease in p27Kip1 that was caused by insulin in combination with LPA (Fig. 5). Regulation of the Rb protein function occurs predominantly though the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the Rb protein predominantly by cyclin D1-Cdk 2/6 (reviewed in Ref. 40Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these residues results in the dissociation of the Rb protein from the E2F transcription factor thereby resulting in increased RNA transcription and progression of cells through the restriction point into the cell cycle. We therefore examined insulin's effect on the phosphorylation of the Rb protein. Although insulin and LPA both increased Rb phosphorylation, we did not observe a potentiating effect of insulin on LPA-mediated Rb phosphorylation (not shown). Epidemiological studies show that the incidence of breast cancer is increased in women with hyperinsulinemic disorders including Type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome (2Giovannucci E.

Most of these epidemiological studies, however, have been based on populations of patients from diabetic clinics without regard to type of diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2). Data from several animal studies show a protective effect from cancer in Type 1 diabetes with a lower incidence of breast cancer (42Heuson J.C. Legros N. Heimann R. Can.

Alternatively, administration of insulin to rats bearing mammary tumors resulted in a significant increase in tumor growth (42Heuson J.C. Legros N. Heimann R. Can. Res. 1972; 32: 233-238PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the epidemiological studies may have underestimated the risk of breast cancer in the hyperinsulinemic state (Type 2 diabetes). In previous experiments, we have shown insulin's ability to induce prenylation of low molecular weight GTPases, specifically farnesylation of Ras protein and geranylgeranylation of Rho-A protein (23Goalstone M.L.

These increases in the pool of prenylated small GTPases result in augmentation of DNA synthesis in response to other growth factors and augmentation of Rho-A-mediated transcriptional activation of SRE-dependent genes by LPA (25Chappell J. Golovchenko I. Wall K. Stjernholm R. Leitner J. Goalstone M. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31792-31797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) as well as transactivation of nuclear factor κB by angiotensin II, hyperglycemia, and advanced glycosylation end products (32Golovchenko I. Goalstone M.L. Watson P. Brownlee M. Draznin B. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The salient feature of the present investigation is that insulin, in addition to its direct mitogenic effects through the PI 3-kinase signaling cascade, potentiates the effect of LPA-mediated MCF-7 cell transition into cell cycle via the Rho-A-dependent activation of cyclin E. Cells preincubated with insulin and then challenged with LPA exhibited a 65% increase in transition into cell cycle, which was greater than insulin alone (40%), LPA alone (5%), and greater than an additive effect of these two agents. Inhibition of a direct mitogenic effect of insulin with wortmannin did not affect the ability of insulin to potentiate the effects of LPA. The addition of the geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor GGTI-286 completely abolished insulin's potentiating effect on LPA-mediated transition into cell cycle, both in the absence and in the presence of wortmannin. Our experiments with insulin effect on BrdUrd incorporation into DNA, as a marker for DNA synthesis and cellular growth, mirrored our results form cell cycle analysis. In addition, transfection of a dominant negative mutant of Rho-A also completely prevented the potentiating effect of insulin. Neither GGTI nor the dominant negative Rho-A had any appreciable effect on insulin alone, whereas wortmannin inhibited the direct effect of insulin. The subsequent set of experiments was designed to identify the point of cell cycle initiation at which insulin exerts its potentiating effect. Because overexpression of either cyclin D1 or cyclin E has been shown to shorten the G1 interval in various mammalian cell lines (47Ando K. Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F. Griffin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 995-997PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to evaluate the effect of insulin on these early events in G1/S-phase transition. Although insulin increased cyclin D1 expression, it had no potentiating influence on the effect of LPA. In contrast, insulin potentiated the effect of LPA on cyclin E expression, even though it had no influence of its own (Fig. 4, A and B). Because the expression of cyclin E is Rho-A-dependent (39Hu W. Bellone C. Baldassare J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3396-3401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,54Tanaka T. Tatsuno I. Noguchi Y. Daigaku U. Oeda T. Narumiya S.

Kreisberg J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and because the effects of LPA are mediated via the Rho-A pathway, our results support the hypothesis that the potentiating influence of insulin on LPA is the result of the insulin-induced increases in the availability of prenylated Rho-A (25Chappell J. Golovchenko I. Wall K. Stjernholm R. Leitner J. Goalstone M. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31792-31797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Also in support of this explanation is the fact that an inhibitor of GGTase I, GGTI-286, and the dominant negative Rho-A completely prevented the potentiating influence of insulin. In concert with our previous findings that GGTI-286 inhibits insulin's ability to potentiate the transcriptional action of LPA (25Chappell J. Golovchenko I. Wall K. Stjernholm R. Leitner J. Goalstone M. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31792-31797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we now show that GGTI-286 completely inhibits the potentiating effect of insulin on LPA actions on cell cycle progression, DNA synthesis, and cyclin E expression. Cell cycle progression and Cdk function are regulated by complex signaling interactions, which include Cdk inhibitors. Cyclind-Cdk 4/6 complexes are essential for G1-phase progression and directly bind (56Sherr C. Roberts J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar) and phosphorylate the Rb protein (57Resnitzky D. Reed S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3463-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In contrast, cyclin E appears to function in both an Rb-dependent and an Rb-independent manner (57Resnitzky D. Reed S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3463-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1, on the other hand, inhibits a broader spectrum of Cdks, including cyclin E-Cdk2 (58Harper J. Elledge S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and has been shown to decrease dependence of cell proliferation on serum mitogens (59Coats S. Flanagan W.

In addition, geranylgeranylated Rho GTPases are essential for the degradation of p27Kip1 and facilitate cell cycle progression (39Hu W. Bellone C. Baldassare J. J. Biol.

We therefore examined the effect of insulin and LPA on p27Kip1 expression and Rb phosphorylation. Consistent with the demonstrated influence of insulin on cyclin E, we found that insulin potentiated LPA-mediated down-regulation of p27Kip1 protein by 33% (p < 0.04). The present data confirm that insulin per se has a significant mitogenic effect in MCF-7 cells. The major intracellular signaling pathway by which insulin enhances growth of these cells appears to be the PI 3-kinase pathway. The stimulatory effect of insulin on cyclin D expression is also consistent with stimulation of PI 3-kinase pathway as the latter has been shown to control posttranslationally the expression of cyclin D (62Muise-Helmericks R.

In contrast to its direct mitogenic effect, insulin also potentiates the effect of LPA, a major serum mitogen. This potentiating influence of insulin appears to involve the prenylation of Rho-A, expression of cyclin E, and inhibition of p27Kip1. These data are in agreement with our previous findings that insulin activates the prenyltransferases via the Shc-MAP kinase signaling pathway (36Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Berhanu P Sharma P.G.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2211-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), EGF, IGF-1, and PDGF effects on DNA synthesis (24Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B.

Moreover, insulin potentiates platelet-derived growth factor-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression and thymidine incorporation in vascular smooth muscle cells as well (65Goalstone M.L. Natarajan R. Standley P.R. Walsh M.F. Leitner J.W. Carel K. Scott S. Nadler J. Sowers J.R. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4067-4072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect of insulin was also mediated by the increased amounts of farnesylated p21Ras (65Goalstone M.L. Natarajan R. Standley P.R. Walsh M.F. Leitner J.W. Carel K. Scott S. Nadler J. Sowers J.R. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4067-4072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that insulin potentiates LPA-mediated cell cycle progression and BrdUrd incorporation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and that the mechanism of the enhanced cell cycle progression is through the Rho-A-dependent up-regulation of cyclin E and down-regulation of the Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1. Because either the presence of GGTI-286 (a geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor) or the expression of a dominant negative Rho-A completely blocks the potentiating effect of insulin on all aspects of LPA-mediated cell cycle progression, we postulate that insulin potentiates LPA action through its effect on Rho-A prenylation and provision of increased amounts of geranylgeranylated Rho-A. We have previously shown that the inhibitory effects of GGTI-286 on insulin's ability to potentiate nuclear effects of LPA are specific and not toxic (25Chappell J. Golovchenko I. Wall K.

This is also confirmed by the current data showing no inhibitory effect of GGTI-286 on insulin alone. Taken together, these data demonstrate that insulin has a significant effect on MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth both in its own right via the PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway and through potentiation of LPA-mediated effects by up-regulation of prenylation of Rho-A. These data help clarify one of the possible mechanisms by which patients with hyperinsulinemia may have an increased incidence of breast cancer (2Giovannucci E.

The interaction of apoE with HSPGs has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and may play a role in neuronal repair. To identify which residues in the heparin-binding site of apoE and which structural elements of heparan sulfate interact, we used a variety of approaches, including glycosaminoglycan specificity assays, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and heparin affinity chromatography. The formation of the high affinity complex required Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 from apoE and N- and 6-O-sulfo groups of the glucosamine units from the heparin fragment. As shown by molecular modeling, using a high affinity binding octasaccharide fragment of heparin, these findings are consistent with a binding mode in which five saccharide residues of fully sulfated heparan sulfate lie in a shallow groove of the α-helix that contains the HSPG-binding site (helix 4 of the four-helix bundle of the 22-kDa fragment). This groove is lined with residues Arg-136, Ser-139, His-140, Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147. In the model, all of these residues make direct contact with either the 2-O-sulfo groups of the iduronic acid monosaccharides or the N- and 6-O-sulfo groups of the glucosamine sulfate monosaccharides.

Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). ApoE is a ligand for members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, heparin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (2Mahley R.W. Isr. J. Med.

It is composed of two domains: a 22-kDa NH2-terminal domain (residues 1–191) and a 10-kDa COOH-terminal domain (residues 216–299) (4Weisgraber K.H. Adv.

McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 2835-2862Google Scholar). After localization, the apoE-containing lipoproteins are transported into the cell by pathways dependent on either the LDL receptor or the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) or by direct uptake of an apoE-containing lipoprotein-HSPG complex (10Mahley R.W.

Binding of apoE to HSPG may also play a role in Alzheimer's disease through either competition between apoE and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) for HSPG-binding sites or by modulation of the HSPG/LRP uptake pathway (14Mahley R.W.

ApoE facilitates the hepatic clearance of lipoprotein remnants from the plasma through LDL receptor- and LRP/HSPG-mediated pathways. Although the LDL receptor-mediated pathway is sufficient for clearing lipoprotein remnants during fasting, the LRP/HSPG-mediated pathway is required for efficient clearance of postprandial lipoprotein remnants (15Mahley R.W. Ji Z.-S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of lipoprotein remnants in the plasma is a major risk factor for development of atherosclerosis (18Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Wilson J.D. Foster D.W. Kronenberg H.M. Larsen P.R. Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. 9th Ed. W. B.

Characterization of the HSPG binding activity of these variants demonstrated that the HSPG binding activity of apoE is decreased by mutations of Arg-136 (19März W. Hoffmann M.M. Scharnagl H.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the LDL receptor binding site and the HSPG-binding site overlap, predicting the physiological effect of each apoE variant is very complex. All variants known to have defective HSPG binding activity also have defective LDL receptor activity. However, moderate to severe defects in HSPG binding activity are strongly associated with dominant inheritance, increased severity, and decreased age of onset of type III hyperlipoproteinemia (9Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed.

Peters-Libeu C. Weisgraber K.H. Segelke B.W. Rupp B. Capila I. Hernáiz L.A. LeBrun R. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2826-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This fragment is composed of four repeats of IdoUA (2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3). Although rare in most heparan sulfates (26Williams K.J. Fuki I.V. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), this disaccharide is commonly found in heparan sulfate isolated from liver (27Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11208-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the structure of the high affinity octasaccharide fragment is similar to the expected physiological ligand of apoE and thus represents a good model to study apoE and heparan sulfate interaction.Given the physiological importance of the interaction between apoE and heparan sulfate, we have used a variety of approaches, including a glycosaminoglycan specificity assay, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), heparin column chromatography, and modeling with the high affinity binding octasaccharide, to determine which residues within the HSPG-binding site of apoE and which structural elements from the high affinity octasaccharide contribute to the interaction. From these results, we propose a model of the apoE·heparan sulfate complex.DISCUSSIONUsing a variety of techniques and approaches, we have identified residues from the HSPG-binding site of apoE and structural elements from heparan sulfate that are required for high affinity interaction. Heparin affinity chromatography demonstrated that Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 from the HSPG-binding site of apoE are required for high affinity heparin binding. In the case of Lys-143 and Arg-147, these results are the first demonstration that mutation of these residues decreases the heparin-binding activity of apoE. Our 13C NMR results imply that Lys-146 participates in an ionic interaction with the heparin fragment, while Lys-143 participates in a hydrogen bond. Finally, the polysaccharide-binding assays indicate that N-sulfo groups on the GlcN residues of heparan sulfate are required for high affinity binding and suggest thatO-sulfo groups also contribute to high affinity binding.To visualize how the N- and O-sulfo groups of the octasaccharide heparin fragment might interact with the residues in the HSPG-binding site of apoE, a model of the octasaccharide fragment of heparin bound to apoE was constructed. We used the x-ray crystal structure of apoE4 (25Dong J. Peters-Libeu C. Weisgraber K.H. Segelke B.W. Rupp B. Capila I. Hernáiz L.A. LeBrun R. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2826-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and a two-dimensional NMR structure of a heparin fragment chemically identical to the high affinity octasaccharide heparin fragment (41Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Jones C. Davies D.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Juxtaposition of these two structures using molecular graphics showed that the spatial pattern of the basic residues on the surface of the HSPG-binding site was highly complementary to the spatial pattern of the N- andO-sulfo groups on the heparin fragment. Only minor adjustments in the positions of the side chains of Arg-142, Arg-145, Lys-143, and Lys-146 and in the torsion angles between the monosaccharides were required to dock the heparin fragment into the HSPG-binding site and maximize the number of interactions. In this alignment, the heparin fragment interacts with Arg-136, Ser-139, His-140, Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147, consistent with the reduced heparin-binding activities of the apoE variants R136H (20Minnich A. Weisgraber K.H. Newhouse Y. Dong L.-M. Fortin L.-J. Tremblay M. Davignon J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 57-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), R142C, K143A, R145C, K146Q, and R147A. After consideration of the conformational flexibility of the IdoUA residues (42Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 7-60Crossref Google Scholar) and further refinement of the model by manual manipulation, we obtained the model shown in Fig. 6.This model is consistent with the results of earlier studies of the binding of heparin to apoE. For example, the trytophan fluorescence of apoE4 increases in the presence of the high affinity octasaccharide fragment (25Dong J. Peters-Libeu C. Weisgraber K.H. Segelke B.W. Rupp B. Capila I. Hernáiz L.A. LeBrun R. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2826-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), indicating that one of the two buried trytophans in apoE4 becomes more solvent-exposed in the complex. When the heparin fragment is docked in the orientation shown in Fig. 6, Trp-34 must be moved to a more solvent-accessible position to accommodate the monosaccharide that interacts with Arg-145. The number of ionic interactions predicted by our model is higher (eight versusthree) than that estimated by Shuvaev et al. (43Shuvaev V.V. Laffont I. Siest G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, their SPR measurements of the glycosaminoglycan binding affinity of apoE were carried out in the presence of phosphate buffer. In our hands, phosphate greatly reduces the binding affinities as determined by SPR. Since phosphate also reduces the binding of heparin fragments to an apoE3 affinity column and of apoE to the heparin affinity column (data not shown), we believe that phosphate competes with heparin for the same binding sites.Our model is also well supported by the biochemical results presented in this paper. Every residue implicated by heparin column chromatography either participates directly in the complex or is potentially part of the solvation shell of the bound heparin fragment. Similarly, in the model, a hydroxyl group from the heparin fragment is hydrogen-bonded to Lys-143. The positioning of a sulfo group near Lys-146 suggests that the very low heparin-binding activity of apoE K146E originates from repulsion between the glutamate and the sulfo group. However, molecular modeling indicates that it is possible to form a salt bridge between Glu-146 and Arg-142, which would position the side chain of Arg-142 so that it blocks the shallow groove in which the heparin fragment is docked. Either possibility is consistent with the observation that the heparin binding activity of apoE K146E is approximately equivalent to that of apoE K146Q at pH 5.0.The model is also in good agreement with the results of the polysaccharide binding assays. In the model, the basic residues in the HSPG-binding site complement all but one of the sulfo groups from the heparin fragment. Each 6-O-sulfo group of the GlcNSO3 (6-OSO3) units and each 2-O-sulfo group of the IdoUA(2-OSO3) units interacts with either an arginine or a lysine from the HSPG-binding site. Similarly, there is an interaction between the 2-N-sulfo group of one of the GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) units, which is consistent with our observation that the GlcNSO3N-sulfo group is required for high affinity binding to apoE. Studies with acidic fibroblast growth factor (44Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) and basic fibroblast growth factor (45DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) have suggested that the pattern of interactions between the sulfo groups and the protein determines the heparan sulfate binding specificity in this family of growth factors (46Faham S. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The pattern of interactions in our model suggests that apoE is specific for highly sulfated heparan sulfate. This conclusion is consistent with the higher binding affinity of apoE for liver-derived than for aorta-derived heparan sulfate, since liver-derived heparan sulfate has a higher proportion ofN- and O-sulfo groups than aorta-derived heparan sulfate (27Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11208-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

J. 1974; 137: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).This ability to discriminate between liver-derived HSPG and HSPG in other parts of the circulatory system is critical for apoE's role in lipoprotein remnant clearance and its potential protective role in slowing the progress of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Intriguingly, the only known example of age-related changes in the pattern of sulfation of HSPG is an increase of Glc(NSO3)(6-OSO3) in the cerebral arteries (49Murata K. Murata A. Yoshida K. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 132: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and in the aorta (50Feyzi E. Saldeen T. Larsson E. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13395-13398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that apoE might have a higher affinity for aorta-derived heparan sulfate from elderly individuals than younger individuals. This higher affinity could potentially promote atherosclerosis in elderly individuals in two ways. First, significant binding between apoE-containing remnants and aorta HSPG could result in retention of the remnants in the aorta, thereby slowing clearance of the remnants by the liver. Second, binding of apoE to aorta HSPG could reduce the effectiveness of macrophage-secreted apoE to clear excess lipids from atherosclerotic lesions. ApoE-dependent reverse cholesterol transport has been suggested to be an important mechanism that retards the development of atherosclerotic lesions (13Lucas M. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13454-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In addition to aging, polymorphisms or changes in physiology that decrease the proportion of N- or O-sulfo groups in liver-derived heparan sulfate might also alter lipoprotein remnant metabolism by modulating the HSPG-binding affinity of apoE-containing lipoproteins. For example, the proportion of N-sulfo groups on liver-derived heparan sulfate is lower in diabetic rats than normal rats (51Kjellén L. Bielefeld D. Hook M. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) due to decreased activity of glucosaminylN-deacetylase (52Unger E. Pettersson I. Eriksson U.J. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8671-8674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In diabetic mice, this decrease in the sulfation of liver-derived heparan sulfate is associated with reduced lipoprotein remnant uptake (53Ebara T. Conde K. Kako Y. Liu Y. Xu Y. Ramakrishnan R. Goldberg I.J. Shachter N.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1807-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our model raises the possibility that decreased glucosaminyl N-deacetylase activity in humans might also reduce lipoprotein remnant metabolism because of poor clearance of apoE-containing lipoproteins. However, there is no evidence that diabetes in humans decreases glucosaminylN-deacetylase activity, as in the rodent model systems.ApoE is not the only protein that binds with high affinity to polysaccharides of IdoUA(2-OSO3)Glc(NSO3)(6-OSO3). Lipoprotein lipase, which also plays a key role in lipoprotein metabolism in the liver, binds with high affinity to a decasaccharide composed of five IdoUA(2-OSO3)Glc(NSO3)(6-OSO3) units (54Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the nervous system, Aβ-(1–40) peptide and heparin-binding growth-associated molecule also bind with highest affinity to oligosaccharides of IdoUA(2-OSO3)Glc(NSO3)(6-OSO3) (55Kinnunen T. Raulo E.

Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30631-30635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins require N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfo groups for highest heparan sulfate binding affinity. Intriguingly, like apoE, both of these proteins have also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease or neuronal repair. However, determining the significance of the redundancy of heparan sulfate-binding sites for apoE, Aβ-(1–40), and heparin-binding growth-associated molecule will require a much better understanding of the role of the HSPG-apoE interaction in neuronal repair and Alzheimer's disease. Human apolipoprotein E (apoE)1 is a 299-residue polymorphic protein that facilitates the transport and metabolism of lipids (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). ApoE is a ligand for members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, heparin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (2Mahley R.W. Isr. J. Med. Sci. 1996; 32: 414-429PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2000; 1: 507-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). It is composed of two domains: a 22-kDa NH2-terminal domain (residues 1–191) and a 10-kDa COOH-terminal domain (residues 216–299) (4Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 22-kDa NH2-terminal domain contains the primary HSPG-binding site (residues 140–150) (5Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) colocalized with the LDL receptor binding site (6Lalazar A. Weisgraber K.H.

Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of apoE to HSPG is an initial step in the localization of apoE-containing lipoproteins to the surface of several different types of cells (9Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 2835-2862Google Scholar). After localization, the apoE-containing lipoproteins are transported into the cell by pathways dependent on either the LDL receptor or the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) or by direct uptake of an apoE-containing lipoprotein-HSPG complex (10Mahley R.W. Huang Y. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Binding of apoE to HSPG affects neurite extension in neurons (11Holtzman D.M. Pitas R.E. Kilbridge J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13454-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Binding of apoE to HSPG may also play a role in Alzheimer's disease through either competition between apoE and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) for HSPG-binding sites or by modulation of the HSPG/LRP uptake pathway (14Mahley R.W.

Kang D.E. Koo E.H. Masliah E. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The best understood physiological role of the binding of apoE to HSPG is in lipoprotein remnant clearance. ApoE facilitates the hepatic clearance of lipoprotein remnants from the plasma through LDL receptor- and LRP/HSPG-mediated pathways. Although the LDL receptor-mediated pathway is sufficient for clearing lipoprotein remnants during fasting, the LRP/HSPG-mediated pathway is required for efficient clearance of postprandial lipoprotein remnants (15Mahley R.W. Ji Z.-S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of lipoprotein remnants in the plasma is a major risk factor for development of atherosclerosis (18Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Wilson J.D. Foster D.W. Kronenberg H.M. Larsen P.R. Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. 9th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1998: 1099-1153Google Scholar). Several naturally occurring variants of apoE are associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia, a disease characterized by elevated plasma lipid levels, due to the accumulations of lipoprotein remnants, and an increased risk of atherosclerosis (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). Characterization of the HSPG binding activity of these variants demonstrated that the HSPG binding activity of apoE is decreased by mutations of Arg-136 (19März W. Hoffmann M.M. Scharnagl H.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the LDL receptor binding site and the HSPG-binding site overlap, predicting the physiological effect of each apoE variant is very complex. All variants known to have defective HSPG binding activity also have defective LDL receptor activity. However, moderate to severe defects in HSPG binding activity are strongly associated with dominant inheritance, increased severity, and decreased age of onset of type III hyperlipoproteinemia (9Mahley R.W.

While this fragment is itself devoid of ligand binding activity, mutational analysis has indicated that its N terminus (L1, amino acids 1–150) and the C terminus of its cysteine-rich domain (amino acids 190–300) contain ligand binding determinants. Mutational analysis also suggests that amino acids 692–702 from the C terminus of the α subunit are critical for ligand binding. A fusion protein, formed from these fragments, binds IGF-I with an affinity similar to that of the whole extracellular domain, suggesting that these are the minimal structural elements of the IGF-I binding site. To further characterize the binding site, we have performed structure directed and alanine-scanning mutagenesis of L1, the cysteine-rich domain and amino acids 692–702. Alanine mutants of residues in these regions were transiently expressed as secreted recombinant receptors and their affinity was determined. In L1 alanine mutants of Asp8, Asn11, Tyr28, His30, Leu33, Leu56, Phe58, Arg59, and Trp79 produced a 2- to 10-fold decrease in affinity and alanine mutation of Phe90 resulted in a 23-fold decrease in affinity. In the cysteine-rich domain, mutation of Arg240, Phe241, Glu242, and Phe251 produced a 2- to 10-fold decrease in affinity. In the region between amino acids 692 and 702, alanine mutation of Phe701 produced a receptor devoid of binding activity and alanine mutations of Phe693, Glu693, Asn694, Leu696, His697, Asn698, and Ile700 exhibited decreases in affinity ranging from 10- to 30-fold. With the exception of Trp79, the disruptive mutants in L1 form a discrete epitope on the surface of the receptor. Those in the cysteine-rich domain essential for intact affinity also form a discrete epitope together with Trp79.

Clemmons D.R. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). They were originally identified as circulating polypeptides with potent mitogenic activity, which mediated many of the actions of growth hormone, and were later shown to be structurally homologous to proinsulin. It is now apparent that these growth factors are produced by many cell types and have paracrine and autocrine as well as endocrine functions. Targeted disruption of the gene for IGF-I1 in transgenic mice results in both embryonic and post-natal growth retardation (2Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). In contrast, the effects of disruption of the IGF-IIgene are confined to growth retardation during the embryonic period (2Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). In addition to being mitogens, it is now evident that these peptides play a crucial role in cell survival (3Baserga R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 842: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and contribute to transformation and the maintenance of the malignant phenotype in many tumor systems (4Khandwala H.M. McCutcheon I.E. Flyvbjerg A. Friend K.E. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 215-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). However, despite extensive study, the signal transduction mechanisms underlying the biological effects of these peptides remain to be elucidated. The mitogenic effects of these growth factors appear to be mediated by receptors belonging to the insulin receptor sub-class of receptor tyrosine kinases (for review see Ref. (5Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1050-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar)). The type 1 IGF receptor binds both peptides with high affinity; the affinity for IGF-I being greater than that for IGF-II. Transgenic experiments indicate that the growth-promoting effects of both peptides can be mediated by this receptor (2Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 6Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Such studies also point to the role of a second receptor in mediating the mitogenic effects of IGF-II (2Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 6Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar), and recent in vitro studies indicate that this is the A isoform of the insulin receptor (7Morrione A. Valentinis B. Xu S.Q. Yumet G. Louvi A. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3777-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); this receptor binds IGF-II with high affinity and can mediate the growth-promoting effects of the peptide (8Frasca F. Pandini C.

The receptors in this family are dimeric protein-tyrosine kinases with significant homology (5Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1050-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In higher vertebrates there are three known members, the insulin receptor (9Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R.

Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Francke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar), and the orphan insulin receptor-related receptor (12Shier P. Watt V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14605-14608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are dimeric Mr 350,000 glycoproteins composed of two disulfide-linked monomers. Each monomer is in turn composed of an N-terminal α subunit and a C-terminal β subunit, which are linked by a single disulfide. The β subunit is both extracellular and intracellular with a single α helical transmembrane domain. The intracellular portion contains the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain. The structure of this domain of the insulin receptor has been determined at high resolution in both the basal and active state (13Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Elis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 14Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Comparative homology modeling suggests that the extracellular portion of the receptors is composed of seven distinct structural domains (15Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Ward C.W.

Trans. 1999; 27: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). At the N terminus there are two homologous globular domains flanking a cysteine-rich domain. The remainder is formed from three fibronectin III repeats, the second of which contains a 100-amino acid insert of undetermined structure. Recently a high resolution crystal structure of an N-terminal fragment of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (amino acids 1–460) has been reported (18Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The molecule is composed of an extended bilobed structure composed of the two globular L domains flanking the cysteine-rich domain with dimensions of 40 × 48 × 105 Å. The N-terminal globular domain contacts the cysteine-rich domain along its length. In contrast there is minimal contact between the C-terminal domain and the cysteine-rich domain. In the crystal structure, L1 and L2 occupy very different positions relative to the cysteine-rich domain. However, this could be an artifact of crystal packing in this fragment, and the position of L2 may be very different in the native molecule (18Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It is possible that it is rotated into a position similar to that of L1 in relation to the cysteine-rich domain. However, irrespective of this, a cavity of ∼24-Å diameter occupies the center of the molecule and possibly represents a binding pocket. Each L domain resembles a loaf of bread with dimensions 24 × 32 × 37 Å and is formed from a single right-handed β helix capped at the ends by short α helices and disulfide bonds. The base of the loaf is formed from a six-stranded β sheet five residues in length. Both sides are formed from β sheets three amino acids in length, and the top is composed of irregular loops connecting the short β strands. As predicted from sequence comparisons, the cysteine-rich domain is composed of repetitive modules resembling parts of laminin and the tumor necrosis factor receptor. These form a rod-like structure connecting the two globular L domains from which a large mobile loop projects into the putative binding pocket. Despite this wealth of structural detail very little is known about the precise location and nature of the ligand binding site(s). Studies with chimeric insulin/IGF-I receptors suggest that the C terminus of the cysteine-rich domain is a major determinant of IGF-I binding specificity (19Kjeldsen T. Andersen A.S. Wiberg F.C. Rasmussen J.S. Schaffer L. Balschmidt P. Moller K.B. Moller N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4404-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Schumacher R. Mosthaf L.

Its location in the N-terminal fragment of the IGF-I receptor is consistent with it forming part of a ligand binding pocket (18Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, alanine mutagenesis of residues in the LI N-terminal globular domain indicate that this also forms part of the ligand binding site (23Mynarcik D.C. Williams P.F. Schaffer L. G.Q. Yu Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18650-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These studies also demonstrated that a C-terminal peptide of the α subunit, amino acids 692–702, is involved in IGF-I binding (23Mynarcik D.C. Williams P.F. Schaffer L. G.Q. Yu Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18650-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fusion of this C-terminal fragment to the N-terminal 460 amino acids results in a recombinant protein, which binds IGF-I with an affinity similar to that of the full-length secreted recombinant extracellular domain (24Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37351-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Molina L. Marino-Buslje C. Quinn D.R. Siddle K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that these elements are sufficient to form an intact ligand binding site. Alanine scanning studies of the structurally related insulin receptor have demonstrated that determinants in the L1 domain and in the C terminus of the α subunit (amino acids 705–715) are sufficient to form a ligand binding site (26Williams P.F.

In the present study we have used alanine mutagenesis to localize the equivalent binding site of the IGF-I receptor. The results of the studies indicate that it is formed from three elements, the first in the L1 domain, the second predominantly in the cysteine-rich domain and the third at the C terminus of the α subunit between amino acids 692 and 702. All molecular biological procedures, including agarose gel electrophoresis, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, bacterial transformation, and DNA sequencing were performed by standard methods (29Sambrook J.

All oligonucleotides were purchased from DNA Technology (Aarhus, Denmark). Restriction and modifying enzymes were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Recombinant IGF-I (receptor grade) was from GroPep (Adelaide, Australia). High performance liquid chromatography-purified mono-iodinated [125I-Tyr31]IGF-I (30Schaffer L. Larsen U.D. Linde S. Hejnaes K.R. Skriver L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1203: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was from Novo Nordisc A/S.

PEAK Rapid cells (293 cells constitutively expressing SV40 large T antigen) were purchased from Edge Biosystems (Gaithersburg, MD). The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-zeo(+) was from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). The hybridoma secreting monoclonal antibody 24-31 directed toward the IGF-I receptor α subunit (31Soos M.A. Field C.E. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Zhang B. Roth R.A. Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Siddle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12955-12963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Drs. M. Soos and K. Siddle (University of Cambridge, UK). Protein A-purified IgG from the hybridoma medium was kindly provided by by Dr. P. Jorgensen (Novo Nordisc A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark). cDNAs encoding both full-length and recombinant secreted extracellular domain of the IGF-I receptor were as previously described (23Mynarcik D.C. Williams P.F. Schaffer L. G.Q. Yu Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18650-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel (32Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Uracil containing single-stranded DNA prepared from phage rescued from Escherichia coli CJ236 transformed with a cDNA encoding the full-length IGF-I receptor cloned into the phagemid pTZ18U. Restriction sites were deleted or introduced with the specific mutation to facilitate screening of the mutants. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant mutant secreted IGF-I receptor cDNAs were reconstructed in the plasmid pcDNA3-zeo(+) for expression. DNA for transfection was prepared from 10-ml overnight cultures by a boiling hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide method (33Del Sal G. Manfioletti G. Schneider C. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 514-520PubMed Google Scholar) followed by purification using QIAwell strips. The mutant receptor cDNAs were expressed transiently in Peak Rapid cells (293 cells constitutively expressing SV40 large T antigen) by transfection using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturers' directions. Conditioned medium was harvested 4 days post-transfection and, if necessary, concentrated prior to assay using Centriprep 30 centrifugal concentrators (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Soluble IGF-I receptor binding assays were performed using a modification of the microtiter plate antibody capture assay that we have described previously (23Mynarcik D.C. Williams P.F. Schaffer L. G.Q. Yu Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18650-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorb, Roskilde, Denmark) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-IGF-I receptor antibody 24-31 IgG (100 μl/well of 46 μg/ml solution in phosphate-buffered saline). Washing, blocking, and receptor binding were as previously described. Competitive binding assays with labeled and unlabeled IGF-I were carried out as done previously, except that the incubation was for 16 h at 25 °C. Binding data were analyzed by computer fitting to a one-site model to obtain the Kd of the expressed protein. Western blotting of conditioned media with an anti-IGF-I receptor α subunit peptide (amino acids 31–50) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was performed using previously described procedures (27Mynarcik D.C. G.Q. Yu Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence using reagents from Pierce (Rockford, IL). In previous alanine-scanning mutagenesis studies of the L1 domain of the structurally related insulin receptor, we have demonstrated that the residues critical for insulin binding are those exposed side chains located in (i) the β sheet forming the wall of the central cavity, i.e. the base of the L1 domain and (ii) the adjacent third β sheet (26Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. G.Q. Yu Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus we systematically mutated the exposed residues in the equivalent regions of the IGF-I receptor to alanine; glycines, prolines, and cysteines were not mutated to avoid potential structurally deleterious effects. The mutant IGF-I receptor cDNAs were transiently expressed in 293 PEAK cells. To confirm and evaluate expression, conditioned medium from transfected cells was analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody directed toward the N terminus of the α subunit of the IGF-I receptor. In conditioned medium from transfections with all mutant cDNAs except those with mutations of Leu32, Leu33, Ser35, Tyr54, and Thr93, a Mr 135,000 protein, representing the IGF-I receptor α subunit was detectable in comparable amounts to that in conditioned media from cells transfected with wild type receptor cDNA (data not shown). The failure to detect receptor in blots of the medium from cells transfected with the Leu32, Leu33, and Ser35 mutant cDNAs despite the presence of IGF-I binding activity in the medium (see below) is presumably because the epitope of the antibody used for these blots is directed toward amino acids 31–50 of the receptor α subunit. In contrast, in medium from cells transfected with Tyr54 and Thr93, there was neither detectable IGF-I binding activity nor receptor detectable by blotting despite the presence of an immunoreactive Mr 160,000 protein corresponding to receptor precursor in detergent lysates of transfected cells (data not shown), a finding that has previously been observed with mutations that impair appropriate folding of this form of the homologous insulin receptor (26Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. G.Q. Yu Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding studies were performed on conditioned media from transfected cells to characterize IGF-I binding to wild type and mutant receptors. As previously described (23Mynarcik D.C. Williams P.F. Schaffer L. G.Q. Yu Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18650-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), IGF-I binding to recombinant secreted receptor displayed simple kinetics and could be best fitted to a single-site model (data not shown). Computer analysis indicated a single population of binding sites with a Kd of 0.67 ± 0.06 × 10−9m (mean ± S.E., n = 8). It should be noted that this value is higher than we have previously reported (23Mynarcik D.C. Williams P.F. Schaffer L. G.Q. Yu Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18650-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and probably reflects changes in the source of IGF-I, assay conditions, and computerized analysis of binding data. Because studies utilizing alanine-scanning mutagenesis have demonstrated that meaningful changes in affinity, produced by a single alanine substitution, range from 2- to 100-fold (34Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), in the experiments described below we regarded any mutant with a greater than 2-fold increase in Kd, i.e. Kd greater than 1.3 × 10−9m, as exhibiting a significant disruption of IGF-I-receptor interactions. The results of our analyses of the IGF-I receptor L1 domain alanine mutants are shown in Fig. 1. Data are expressed as a ratio of the dissociation constant of the mutant receptor to that of the wild type receptor. Conditioned medium from cells transfected with two mutant cDNAs discussed above, Tyr54 and Thr93, failed to exhibit sufficient [125I-Tyr31]IGF-I binding to permit accurate quantitative analysis of the expressed receptors' binding properties. As discussed, immunoblotting failed to reveal any evidence of secretion of these receptors from the cell, indicating that the mutant proteins were malfolded. Of the other 27 alanine mutants, 10 caused a significant impairment of IGF-I binding, i.e. greater than 2-fold increase in Kd. Eight of these 10 mutants (Asp8, Asn11, Tyr28, His30, Leu33, Leu56, Phe58, and Arg59) are located in the N-terminal half of the L1 domain and result in increases in Kd for IGF-I ranging from 3-fold (Phe58) to 9-fold (Asp8). One mutant (Trp79), which results in a 3-fold increase in Kd for IGF-I is located in the bulge region, amino acids, in the fourth turn of the β helix. The last mutant (Phe90) is located in the C-terminal half of the domain and results in a 23-fold increase in Kd. With the exception of glycines, prolines, and cysteines, we mutated to alanine all the residues, in the cysteine-rich domain, that are predicted to be accessible to ligand, on the basis of the published structure of the receptor N-terminal fragment (18Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), i.e. in the region between amino acids 240 and 284. When expressed in 293 PEAK cells, all alanine mutants in this region appeared to be secreted normally, on the basis of immunoblotting of conditioned media and cell lysates as described above (data not shown). Thus it is likely that there was no major perturbation of receptor structure attributable to the mutations. Equlibrium binding assays were performed on conditioned media from the transfected cells to characterize the IGF-I binding properties of the mutant receptors. Fig. 2 summarizes these results. Only 4 out of a total of 26 mutations produced significant decreases in affinity for IGF-I. These are all located at the N terminus of the region analyzed and produce decreases of 2- to 6-fold; the largest decreases of 6- and 4-fold are produced by the mutations of Phe241 and Glu242, respectively, to alanine. We systematically mutated amino acids 692 to 702 to alanine and expressed the resulting mutant cDNAs in 293 PEAK cells. As previously reported, when analyzed by immunoblotting as described above, all mutants appeared to be folded and secreted normally (data not shown) (23Mynarcik D.C. Williams P.F. Schaffer L. G.Q. Yu Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18650-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding studies were performed on conditioned media to evaluate the IGF-I binding properties of the mutants. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 3. Three mutants Phe695, Ser699, and Val702 appeared to be without effect on affinity for IGF1. Mutation of Phe701 produced a receptor that had no detectable IGF-I binding activity. Mutation of Phe692, Glu693, Asn694, Leu696, His697, Asn698, and Ile700to alanine results in decreases in affinity for IGF-I ranging from 10-fold (Asn698) to 29-fold (Phe692). In the present study, using structure-directed and alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we have identified 22 amino acids in the α subunit of the IGF-I receptor, which appear to be functional determinants of its ligand binding site. Ten of these are located in the L1 domain, four in the cysteine-rich domain, and eight at the C terminus of the α subunit. The amino acids in the L1 and cysteine-rich domains are organized into two discontinuous epitopes. The first of these is located in the N-terminal part of the L1 domain and is composed of the amino acids Asp8, Asn11, Tyr28, His30, Leu33, Leu56, Phe58, Arg59, and Phe90. They form a footprint on the β sheet, which forms the base of the domain and the wall of the putative ligand binding cavity (Fig. 4). Mutation of each of these residues to alanine produces a 2- to 10-fold decrease in affinity with the exception of Phe90, which produced a 23-fold decrease. The second epitope is formed from the L1 residue Trp79, which is located in the loop/bulge (amino acids 78–85) between the β sheets forming one of the sides and the base of the domain and the cysteine-rich domain residues Arg240, Phe241, Glu242, and Phe251; Trp79 is in contact with Glu242 (Fig. 4). These form a small patch on the cysteine-rich domain adjacent to the base of the L1 domain. Mutation of each of these residues results in a 2- to 6-fold decrease in affinity. The observation that the disruptive mutants in both domains form contiguous patches on the protein surface surrounded by non-disruptive mutations provides strong evidence that they are contact sites for IGF-I (34Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The third element of the binding site is formed from amino acids Phe692, Glu693, Asn694, Leu696, His697, Asn698, Ileu697, and Phe701, located at the C terminus of the α subunit, a region of the receptor for which there is no structural information. Thus, whether all the side chains forming this binding element are directly involved in interaction with IGF-I or whether the effects of the mutations are indirect cannot be ascertained, until the structure of this region of the receptor is determined. Nonetheless, the magnitude of the observed effects of the mutations of amino acids in this region on affinity for IGF-I indicate that this element of the binding site appears to provide the majority of the free energy of the interaction with IGF-I, as we have previously observed for the homologous insulin receptor (28Mynarcik D.C. Williams P.F. Schaffer L. G.Q. Yu Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2077-2081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The data summarized above imply that this ligand binding site of the IGF-I receptor is formed from 14–22 amino aci"
https://openalex.org/W2104415884,"We used yeast “two-hybrid” screening to isolate cDNA-encoding proteins interacting with the N-terminal domain of the Ras nucleotide exchange factor CDC25Mm. Three independent overlapping clones were isolated from a mouse embryo cDNA library. The full-length cDNA was cloned by RACE-polymerase chain reaction. It encodes a large protein (1080 amino acids) highly homologous to the human deubiquitinating enzyme hUBPy and contains a well conserved domain typical of ubiquitin isopeptidases. Therefore we called this new protein mouse UBPy (mUBPy). Northern blot analysis revealed a 4-kilobase mRNA present in several mouse tissues and highly expressed in testis; a good level of expression was also found in brain, where CDC25Mm is exclusively expressed. Using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, we demonstrated an “in vitro” interaction between mUBPy and the N-terminal half (amino acids 1–625) of CDC25Mm. In addition “in vivo” interaction was demonstrated after cotransfection in mammalian cells. We also showed that CDC25Mm, expressed in HEK293 cells, is ubiquitinated and that the coexpression of mUBPy decreases its ubiquitination. In addition the half-life of CDC25Mm protein was considerably increased in the presence of mUBPy. The specific function of the human homolog hUBPy is not defined, although its expression was correlated with cell proliferation. Our results suggest that mUBPy may play a role in controlling degradation of CDC25Mm, thus regulating the level of this Ras-guanine nucleotide exchange factor.

We have previously cloned a mouse brain-specific Ras-GEF, called CDC25Mm (1Martegani E. Vanoni M. Zippel R. Coccetti P. Brambilla R. Ferrari C. Sturani E. Alberghina L.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4007-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or Ras-GRF1. CDC25Mm is a large protein (140 kDa) that contains a Ras-exchange domain in the C-terminal region and several different domains in the large N-terminal region, namely two PH (pleckstrin homology) domains, one DH (Dbl homology) domain, and an illimaquinone (IQ) domain (2Cen H. Papageorge A.C. Zippel R. Lowy D.R. Zhang K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4007-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In addition a coiled-coil region and a PEST sequence were identified (4Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Several evidences indicate that the large N-terminal region of CDC25Mm has a regulatory function and may interact with other cellular components. We have previously shown that the expression in mouse fibroblasts of a truncated form of CDC25Mm, lacking the Ras exchange domain, behaves as a dominant negative protein (5Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar). In addition PH domains could interact with phospholipids (6Chen R.H. Corbalan-Garcia S. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and with the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (7Touhara K. Inglese J. Pichter J.A. Shou G. Lefkowitz R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the IQ domain binds calmodulin (3Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A.

Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Further evidence that the N-terminal region of CDC25Mm protein is involved in specific protein interaction(s) also comes from the work of Kiyonoet al. (9Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in which it was shown that CDC25Mm/Ras-GRF1 was able to activate Rac1 and that for this activity a functional DH domain is required. Moreover the DH domain was required for homodimerization of Ras-GRF1 or for heterodimerization with Ras-GRF2 (10Anborgh P.H. Qian X.L. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. DeClue J.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4611-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) However, so far, only the specific interaction CDC25Mm/calmodulin has been demonstrated in vivo (3Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 8Zippel R. Gnesutta N. Matus-Leibovich N. Mancinelli E. Saya D. Vogel Z. Sturani E. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 48: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify mammalian proteins that could interact with the large N-terminal region of CDC25Mm, we used a yeast “two-hybrid” system for the screening of mouse embryo cDNA libraries (11Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Here we report that the cloning and characterization of a cDNA that was positive in this screening. This cDNA was found to encode a new deubiquitinating enzyme belonging to the ubiquitin isopeptidase family (UBPs) and was highly homologous to the recently identified human enzyme hUBPy (12Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar); therefore we called this new cDNA mouse UBPy (mUBPy). The system developed by Vojteket al. (11Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) was used for the two-hybrid screening. Two mouse embryo cDNA libraries (9.5 and 10.5 dpc) constructed in pVP16 vector (a gift of Stan Hollenberg) were used. Three bait plasmids were prepared by cloning fragments of the N-terminal region of CDC25Mm in the pBTM116 vector, which contained the Lex-A DNA binding domain (11Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). The first bait plasmid (pBTEE) contains 1877 bp of CDC25MmIV (2Cen H. Papageorge A.C. Zippel R. Lowy D.R. Zhang K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4007-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which corresponds to the first 625 amino acids; this region includes the first PH domain, the IQ motif, the Dbl homology (DH) domain, and the second PH domain. pBTES contains 1519 bp of CDC25MmIV, corresponding to the first 506 amino acids, and lacks the second PH domain, whereas pBTEP contains 436 bp, corresponding to the first 145 amino acids, and contains only the first PH domain. The yeast strain L40 (MATa, his3,trp1, leu2, ade2,LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3,URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ) was transformed with the bait vector (initially pBTEE) and with the mouse embryo cDNA libraries. Selection was performed as described by Vojteket al. (11Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) in selective minimal plates containing 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. Positive clones, obtained only by the 10.5-dpc library, were also tested for β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids were recovered from positive clones and used for a new round of screening to test their positivity. Positive clones were sequenced and then tested with the other plasmids containing reduced regions of CDC25Mm (pBTES and pBTEP). RACE reactions were done using Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) from 11.5-dpc mouse embryo and a mix of polymerases (Advantage Klen-Taq Mix,CLONTECH) suitable for amplification of long regions of DNA with high fidelity. The PCR conditions were set and performed according to the protocols given byCLONTECH. Four oligonucleotides were used, two for 3′ RACE and two for 5′ RACE using a nested PCR procedure to obtain an increased specificity. For 3′ RACE, the external primer was GSS1 (5′-GCTCAGCGAGAACCTTTGACGAGAGC-3′), and the internal one was GSS2 (5′-CCTGAAATGGCTCCTCGTCTGCACC-3′). For 5′ RACE, the external primer was GSA1 (5′-GGTGCAGACGAAGGAGCCATTTCAGG-3′), and the internal one was GSA2 (5′-GCTCTCGTCAAAGGTTCTCGCTGAGC-3′). Two oligonucleotides (i.e. GSS1 and GSA1) were also used in a control reaction to verify the presence of the specific cDNA in the pool. Positivity was revealed by a 176-bp fragment. The amplification products of 3′ and 5′ RACE were cloned in pMOSBlue (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sequenced. Three clones were sequenced both for 3′ and 5′ amplification products. Sequencing was performed on both strands using the Taq Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) with universal and walking primers and using an automated DNA sequence analyzer (Applied Biosystems 373A). The full-length cDNA was obtained by using the unique NdeI site present in the overlapping region and was subcloned in pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). pCDNA3-mUBPy-HA vector was prepared by ligation of a cDNA fragment of 2.5 kilobase pairs comprising the coding sequence of aa 542–1080 of mUBPy in pBSKSII-HA vector (Stratagene), and then aSphI-EcoRI fragment coding for a fusion between HA tag and the aa 542–1080 of mUBPy was subcloned in pCDNA3 plasmid. HA-ubiquitin vector and pCDNA3-hUBPy plasmid were obtained by G. Draetta (12Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For Northern blots, polyadenylated RNAs from mouse tissues (total mouse RNA, Ambion) were separated on agarose-formaldehyde gels (5 µg/lane), blotted to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with a digoxygenin-labeled riboprobe. Signals were detected with the Nucleic Acid Detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The probe was prepared by subcloning a fragment of mUBPy cDNA in a pGEM3z vector (Promega) and in vitrotranscription with T7 RNA polymerase and digoxygenin-labeled UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The searches for open reading frames and their conceptual translations were performed with DM software (13Mount D.W. Conrad B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The homology search was done at the BLAST (14Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59920) Google Scholar) server at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Protein alignments were done with MACAW (15Schuler D.G. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proteins. 1991; 9: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), while the search for motifs in protein was done with Profilescan at the Expasy server (www.expasy.ch/). The cDNA contained in one of the positive clones (6/12) was subcloned in the SmaI site of theEscherichia coli expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to obtain a fusion protein between GST and 119 amino acids of mUBPy corresponding to position 542 to 660 of the whole protein. E. coli DH5α cells bearing the vector for fusion protein were grown in LB broth, induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 28 °C for 3 h, and collected for protein extraction. Fusion protein was purified with glutathione-Sepharose resin as described (16Jacquet E. Vanoni M. Ferrari C. Alberghina E. Martegani E. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24181-24183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). About 1 mg of purified fusion protein (GST-mUBPy542–660) was used to immunize New Zealand rabbits. Polyclonal antibodies were then affinity-purified using a GST-coupled Affi-Gel-10 column (Bio-Rad) as described (17Ferrari C. Zippel R. Martegani E. Gnesutta N. Carrera V. Sturani E. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For pull-down experiments, the GST-mUBPy542–660 fusion protein was used, coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Tissues from adult CD1 mice (Charles River, Calco (LC), Italy) were mechanically homogenized with 4 volumes of Tris (0.125 m, pH 6.8) and SDS (7% w/v). The homogenate was further sonicated in ice and centrifuged (20,000 × g for 10 min); the solubilized proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were probed with affinity-purified anti-mUBPy polyclonal antibodies (diluted 1:1000). Bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins and revealed by the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells cultures were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in RIPA buffer (Tris-HCl, 50 mm; NaCl, 150 mm; sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% w/v; SDS, 0.1% w/v; Triton X-100, 1% w/v) containing protease inhibitors (leupeptin, 1 µm; aprotinin, 0.1 µm; sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm). Aliquots of cleared cell lysate were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-mUBPy antibodies. NIH-3T3, COS7, and Hek-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Subconfluent cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) method according to the protocol of the manufacturer. 48 h after transfection, COS7 cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in RIPA buffer or in lysis buffer (HNGT) (Hepes, 25 mm; NaCl, 50 mm; glycerol, 10% w/v; Triton X-100, 1% w/v). The buffers contained protease inhibitors. Aliquots of lysates (450 µl) were then incubated with 50 µl of glutathione-Sepharose resin loaded either with GST-mUBPy525–660 fusion protein or with GST alone for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the resin was recovered by gentle centrifugation and washed five times with the incubation buffer (RIPA or HGNT). At the end, the resin was treated with 30 µl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 min, and the recovered proteins were used for Western blot analysis. 48 h after transfection, cells (COS7 or Hek-293) were harvested and lysed in 500 µl/plate (100 mm) of an ice-cold HNGT buffer as described (18Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation from cleared lysates was performed with monoclonal anti-HA-11 antibody (BAbCO) or with anti-mUBPy polyclonal antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered with protein G-Sepharose or with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C and then resuspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Briefly 150 of cleared cell lysates and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with anti Ras-GRF1 (C-20, Santa Cruz, CA) or with polyclonal anti-mUBPy raised in our laboratory. Immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using goat anti-rabbit antiserum coupled to horseradish peroxidase as secondary antibodies (Cappel). We used a mouse testis extract as a source of ubiquitinated protein as described in Ref. 19Lin H. Yin L. Reid J. Wilkinson K.D. Wing S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20357-20363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar with minor modifications. The cleared extracts were dialyzed against Tris-HCl 50 mm, MgCl2 5 mm, and dithiothreitol 2 mm. The sample was then centrifuged and washed several times in a Centricon-3 concentrator (Amicon) to remove residualN-ethylmaleimide (12Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Aliquots (50 µg) of the proteins were then incubated with immunoprecipitates (anti-HA antibodies) from COS7 cells transfected with pCDNA3-mUBPy-HA vector at 37 °C and processed as described in Ref. 19Lin H. Yin L. Reid J. Wilkinson K.D. Wing S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20357-20363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar using anti-ubiquitin antibodies (Sigma). Hek-293 cells transfected with the different plasmids (as reported in the figure legends) were lysed in RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitation from the same amount of total protein was performed with antibodies against Ras-GRF1 or anti-HA (BAbCO). Immunocomplexes were recovered with protein G-Sepharose (for anti-HA monoclonal antibodies) or protein A-Sepharose (for Ras-GRF1 antibodies) and analyzed in Western blotting with the different primary antibodies and then revealed with the corresponding secondary antibody and the ECL system. Hek-293 cells were transiently transfected with 1 µg of pCDNA3-CDC25Mm alone and then cotransfected with 1.5 µg of pCDNA3-mUBPy or with 1.5 µg of pCDNA3-human UBPy antisense (12Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were washed two times with minimum Eagle's medium without methionine. Cells were then incubated for 2 h with minimum Eagle's medium without methionine with [35S]methionine (100 µC/60-mm dish), Hepes 25 mm, and fetal calf serum 0.1%. After the incubation, cells were washed two times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and further incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum 10%. At the appropriate time, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer, and the lysates were clarified. Immunoprecipitation from lysates was performed in the presence of Ras-GRF1 antibody (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the immunocomplexes were recovered with protein A (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Equal numbers of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts from cell extracts were immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer solution and then resuspended in 50 µl of SDS-sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The dry gels were exposed to x-ray films (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the intensity of specific bands was analyzed by densitometry with NIH-Image software. We used the N-terminal region (first 625 aa) of CDC25Mm as a bait for a yeast two-hybrid screening. This fragment comprises all the identified motifs except the catalytic one,i.e. the first PH domain, the IQ domain, and the DH-PH module, and it is the same region that, when expressed in mammalian cells, behaves as a dominant negative protein (5Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar). For the screening, we used two different mouse embryo cDNA libraries in pVP16 vector given by S. Hollenberg (11Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) After two rounds of selection, we identified three “true” positive clones, all derived from the 10.5-dpc cDNA library. These clones contained small cDNA inserts (about 400 bp), which shared a common overlapping region of ∼300 bp. The largest clone (called 6/12) was further characterized for its ability to interact in yeast with different shorter regions of CDC25Mm. A positive interaction was obtained with pBTES plasmid containing the first 506 aa of CDC25Mm and thus lacking the second PH domain, whereas no interaction was observed with pBTEP plasmid that contains only the first PH domain of CDC25Mm (not shown). On the basis of these results, we can conclude that the region of CDC25Mmbetween aa 145 and aa 506, containing the IQ motif and the DH domain, is required for this in vivo interaction. The sequence of the 6/12 clone revealed an open reading frame (3′-5′ open) encoding a short proline-rich polypeptide (119 aa) homologous to a small central region of a human gene product called hUBPy, originally reported to encode a putative deubiquitinating enzyme (20Nomura N. Nagase T. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Seki N. Kawarasabayasi Y. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and recently demonstrated to be actually a deubiquitinase (12Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The full-length mouse cDNA was cloned by RACE-PCR using a mouse embryo-cDNA (Marathon-Ready cDNA, CLONTECH) starting from this central region. Several clones were obtained both for the 3′ region and the 5′ region and were completely sequenced. The 3970-bp cDNA contains a complete open reading frame of 3240 nucleotides encoding a 1080 aa protein, 18 bp upstream the putative AUG start codon and 713 bp downstream the stop codon (Fig.1). Because the open reading frame shared a great homology (higher than 90%) with the hUBPy, we called this new mouse protein mouse UBPy (mUBPy). The homology is very high in the C-terminal region (97% identity between aa 591–1080) that contains the typical hallmarks of the UBP family of deubiquitinating enzymes, i.e. a well conserved UCH-2 domain (aa 739–1072, Profilescan) with the characteristic cysteine and histidine boxes (21Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar,22Wilkinson K.D. Tashayev V.L. O'Connor L.B. Larsen C.N. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of mUBPy also contains a highly homologous region (88% identity aa 1–346) followed by a region of lower homology (68% identity aa 346–590). A search for motifs in this N-terminal region revealed only a highly conserved Rhodanese/cdc25 fold (aa 198–311) (23Hoffman K. Bucher P. Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly the Rhodanese/cdc25 fold has been found in the noncatalytic region of several yeast ubiquitin hydrolases (yeast Ubp4, 5 and 7), in the noncatalytic domain of dual specificity MAPK-phosphatases, and in the yeast phosphotyrosine phosphate-phosphatase (23Hoffman K. Bucher P. Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Other interesting features of mUBPy protein are the presence of two long proline-rich regions (aa 300–450 and aa 560–740, respectively), which contain several PEST-like motifs, and two coiled-coil regions (aa 95–140 and 460–500). The human homolog hUBPy was initially identified as the predicted product of a cDNA found in myeloblasts (20Nomura N. Nagase T. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Seki N. Kawarasabayasi Y. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Successively, Naviglio et al. (12Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) found the protein in several human cell lines (human fibroblasts WI-38, osteosarcoma U2OS, HeLa cells, etc.). Northern blot analysis performed on RNA extracted from several mouse tissues evidenced the presence of a 4-kilobase mUBPy mRNA in most of the probed tissues (Fig.2A). As expected, this mRNA was also present in mouse embryo and in adult mouse brain; however, mUBPy mRNA was found to be particularly abundant in testis. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a GST fusion protein (containing 119 aa of mUBPy) expressed in E. coli. The antiserum was treated with immobilized GST to remove the anti-GST component and then used for Western blot experiments. An immunoscreening of mouse tissues revealed the presence of a strong specific immunoreactive band of 120 kDa (in agreement with the expected molecular size of the mUBPy open reading frame: 122,579 Da) in mouse brain and testis homogenates (Fig. 2B). A lower signal was observed in pancreas, lung, small intestine, and placenta homogenates, whereas a barely detectable signal was present in liver, spleen, kidney, and heart (Fig. 2B). These results are generally in agreement with the results obtained with Northern blot experiments. Therefore the mUBPy protein is expressed at a very low level in most of the adult mouse tissues with a strong expression in brain and testis only. Moreover, mUBPy is not an easily soluble protein because to detect it in most tissues, we needed strong detergent conditions (i.e. 7% SDS). When a mild extraction procedure (1% Triton X-100) was used, mUBPy could be detected only in brain and testis (not shown). Since the human homolog hUBPy is expressed in several cell lines (12Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), we also looked for the expression of the mUBPy protein in mouse fibroblasts; moreover we also probed two human cell lines with our antibodies. A 120-kDa band was detected in the mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts extract (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2); however, no difference was observed between proliferating and density-arrested NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. In addition a sharp 130-kDa band was detected in both Hek-293 cells and SN-K-BE neuroblastoma cells, indicating that our antibodies also recognize the human hUBPy protein. This was not unexpected because the protein region we used for the preparation of anti-mUBPy polyclonal antibodies contains a large amino acid sequence (aa 592–657 of mUBPy, see Fig. 1), which is identical in the two proteins. Since mUBPy has a high homology with hUBPy that has been demonstrated to have a UBP (ubiquitin-isopeptidase) activity (12Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), we expected that also mUBPy has an UBP activity. To verify this, we used a mouse testis protein extract, pretreated with N-ethylmaleimide, as a source of ubiquitinated proteins as reported by Lin et al. (19Lin H. Yin L. Reid J. Wilkinson K.D. Wing S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20357-20363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the addition of HA-immunoprecipitates from COS7 cells transfected with HA-tagged mUBPy (aa 542–1080) expressing vector greatly reduced the amount of ubiquitinated protein recognized by anti-ubiquitin antibodies, indicating that mUBPy can deubiquitinate ubiquitin from high molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins. We have previously identified mUBPy in a two-hybrid screening for protein interaction with the Ras-GEF CDC25Mm. It was, however, important to confirm this interaction directly in vitro and successively in an in vivo assay using mammalian cells. A GST fusion protein containing the 119 aa of the clone 6/12 found to be positive in the yeast two-hybrid screening was tested for in vitro interaction with the N-terminal region of CDC25Mm by pull-down experiments. As shown in Fig.4, a specific interaction with the CDC25Mm N-terminal fragment can be revealed. This result is in agreement with that obtained by the yeast two-hybrid system. To validate the above results, we tested the in vivointeraction between CDC25Mm and mUBPy by co-expressing the two proteins in mammalian cells. CDC25Mm and a HA-tagged mUBPy (aa 542–1080) were transfected in COS7 cells either separately or together. 48 h after transfection, lysates were prepared and processed for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies. The recovered immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted. The blots were probed with anti-Ras-GRF1 antibodies and with polyclonal antibodies raised against"

The study of the human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor saquinavir with Caco-2 cells and phospholipid membranes reveals that the compound interacts with the lipidic bilayer of model membranes with a simple hyperbolic binding profile but with Caco-2 cells in a cooperative way involving membrane receptors. Additional studies indicated that colchicine acts as a competitor ligand to saquinavir and suggests, in agreement with other reports, that the identity of the saquinavir receptor could be P-glycoprotein or the multiple drug resistance-associated protein. The modification of the magnitude of the membrane dipole potential using compounds such as cholesterol, phloretin, and 6-ketocholestanol influences the binding capacity of saquinavir. Furthermore, removal of cholesterol from the cell membrane using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin significantly decreases the binding capacity of saquinavir. Because removal of cholesterol from the cell membrane has been reported to disrupt membrane domains known as rafts, our observations imply that the membrane dipole potential plays an important role as a modulator of molecule-membrane interactions in these membrane structures. Such a role is suggested to contribute to the altered behavior of receptor-mediated signaling systems in membrane rafts."

The identification of a fucose modification on human CR within its EGF-like domain and the presence of a consensus fucosylation site within all EGF-CFC family members suggest that this is a biologically important modification in CR, which functionally distinguishes it from the EGF ligands that bind the type 1erbB growth factor receptors. A single CR point mutation, Thr-88 → Ala, results in a form of the protein that is not fucosylated and has substantially weaker activity in cell-based CR/Nodal signaling assays, indicating that fucosylation is functionally important for CR to facilitate Nodal signaling.

The EGF-CFC family members contain two conserved domains: a variant of the EGF domain (often called “EGF-like”) and a unique cysteine-rich domain, CFC, named for the founding members of the family:CR in humans (3Ciccodicola A. Dono R. Obici S. Simeone A. Zollo M. Persico M.G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1987-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), FRL-1 in Xenopus(4Kinoshita N. Minshull J. Kirschner M.W.

The EGF-like domain in EGF-CFC proteins differs from the canonical three-loop EGF structure in that loop 1 is deleted, loop 2 is truncated, and loop 3 is well conserved (6Lohmeyer M. Harrison P.M.

Studies on the zebrafish CR ortholog, one-eyed pinhead (oep), indicated that the C-terminal region of oep may contain a putative GPI anchorage site (7Zhang J. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F.

Zhang J. Cheng S. Heckscher E. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Cell. 1999; 97: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The recent characterization of murine cripto (9Minchiotti G. Parisi S. Liguori G. Signore M. Lania G. Adamson E.D. Lago C.T. Persico M.G. Mech.

Cell. 1999; 97: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) define oep as necessary for gastrulation and left-right patterning during development. These studies have defined an obligatory role for EGF-CFC proteins as “co-factors” for the correct signaling of the TGFβ family member, Nodal (reviewed in Refs. 10Shen M.M. Schier A.F.

Murine Nodal also plays a major role in gastrulation and regulating left-right asymmetry during mesoderm formation in early embryogenesis. Phenotypic similarities are exhibited by nodal and cripto null mice, suggesting that the Cripto-Nodal signaling pathway defined in zebrafish is likely to be conserved for at least a subset of Nodal activities (12Collignon J.

Thus Nodal is autoregulated. Although a specific receptor for the EGF-CFC and Nodal proteins has not yet been identified, activin type I and II receptors have been genetically implicated in zebrafish (8Gritsman K. Zhang J.

For example, O-fucosylation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator within its EGF-like module is critical for signaling through its receptor (20Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Bernier S.M. Haq M. Bolivar I.

Nature. 1995; 373: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and recent studies on the Notch-Delta/Serrate signaling system have implicated the fucosylation state of Notch as important for modulating its ability to interact more favorably with the Delta ligandversus the Serrate ligand (23Moloney D.J.

Here we identify by mass spectroscopy and peptide mapping that recombinant human CR produced as a soluble form in CHO cells is fucosylated. The modification was mapped to a 7-amino acid sequence within the EGF-like domain that fits the fucosylation consensus site (21Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This consensus site is present in all EGF-CFC proteins but not in the EGF-family member ligands that bind type I erbB growth factor receptor family members. Mutating Thr-88 of human CR to alanine blocks the addition of the fucose modification on the CR protein, and this alteration abolishes the ability of CR to function as a co-factor for Nodal. The significance of the fucosylation in modulating CR function with respect to the role of CR in development and cancer is discussed. Recombinant human CR was expressed in CHO cells as a C-terminally truncated form fused to human IgG1 hinge and Fc domain. An expression plasmid (pSGS480) was constructed by subcloning a cDNA encoding human CR residues 1–169, fused in frame after residue 169 to the Fc hinge and CH2CH3 portion of human IgG1(CR(ΔC)-Fc) into the vector pEAG1100. pEAG1100 is a derivative of plasmid pCMV-Sport-β-gal (Life Technologies, Inc.) and was made by removing the reporter gene β-galactosidase NotI fragment from the plasmid. CHO cells in serum-free medium (CD-CHO medium; Life Technologies, Inc.) were transiently transfected with plasmid pSGS480 at room temperature for 15 min using DMRIE-C (Life Technologies, Inc.) cationic lipid plus cholesterol solution. The transfected cells were grown as a suspension culture in a spinner flask for 8 days at 28 °C. The conditioned medium was clarified by centrifugation, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter, and stored at −70 °C. CR(ΔC)-Fc protein expression was assessed by Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, conditioned medium and cells from CR transfected cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels under reducing conditions and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose, and the CR protein was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (antibody 1579) raised against a CR 17-mer peptide (comprising residues 97–113 of human CR)-KLH conjugate (27Saeki T. Stromberg K. Qi C.F. Gullick W.J. Tahara E. Normanno N. Ciardiello F. Kenney N. Johnson G.R. Salomon D.S.

Sanicola, unpublished data. CR(ΔC)-Fc was purified from the conditioned medium on a protein A-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound protein was eluted with 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 2.8, 100 mm NaCl. The eluate was neutralized with 0.5 msodium phosphate, pH 8.6, analyzed for total protein content from absorbance at 280 nm (Extinction coefficient = 59181 mol−1 cm−1), and analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE. The eluted protein was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and stored at −70 °C. N-terminal sequencing was carried out on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Procise HT sequencer and run in the pulsed liquid mode equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. The EGF-like domain of human CR comprising residues 75–112 was also expressed as a Fc fusion protein. An expression plasmid (pSGS422) was constructed by subcloning a cDNA encoding human VCAM-1 signal peptide (28Hession C. Tizard R. Vassallo C. Schiffer S.B. Goff D. Moy P. Chi-Rosso G. Luhowskyj S. Lobb R. Osborn L. J. Biol.

Plasmid pSGS422 was transiently transfected into CHO cells, and the CR(EGF)-Fc protein was purified from the conditioned medium by chromatography on protein A as described above for CR(ΔC)-Fc. A C-terminally truncated form of CR (CR(ΔC)) that was not fused to Fc was generated by transiently transfecting into CHO a cDNA encoding human CR amino acid residues 1–169 as described above. The cells were grown as above, and CR(ΔC) was purified from the conditioned medium by immunoaffinity chromatography on the anti-CR mAb column A40G12.8 that was prepared by conjugating 4 mg of the anti-CR mAb A40G12.8/ml of CNBr-activated Sepahrose 4B resin. 3H. Adkins, S. Schiffer, P. Rayhorn, D. Salomon, K. P. Williams, and M. Sanicola, manuscript in preparation. Bound protein was eluted with 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 2.8, 100 mm NaCl, and the eluate was neutralized with 0.5m sodium phosphate, pH 8.6. Aliquots of CR protein (CR(ΔC)-Fc or CR(EGF)-Fc) in 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5% acetonitrile were treated with 5 milliunits of PNGase F (Glyko, Inc.) for 18 h at 37 °C. The PNGase F-treated sample in 0.5 m guanidine HCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, was reduced with 4 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. The sample was desalted on-line prior to electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis using a LC-Packings Ultimate HPLC interfaced to a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The protein was desalted on a Vydac C4 guard column at a flow rate of 50 μl/min with a 15-min 5–65% acetonitrile gradient in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The mass spectra were acquired by scanning them/z range 400–2000 in 5 s/scan. The raw data were deconvoluted using the Micromass MaxEnt program to generate zero charge mass spectra. All masses are averages unless otherwise noted. CR protein (CR(ΔC)-Fc or CR(EGF)-Fc) in phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm EDTA was reduced with 5 mm dithiothreitol for 6 h at room temperature and then treated with 150 milliunits of PNGase F (Glyko, Inc.)/mg of protein for 16 h at 37 °C. The sample was adjusted to 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 35 min at 45 °C, and then alkylated with 30 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at 20 °C. The alkylated protein was precipitated by addition of 40 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. The solution was stored at −20 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was washed twice with ice-cold ethanol. The alkylated protein was resuspended in 1m urea, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and digested with endoproteinase (Endo) Lys-C from Achromobacter lyticus (WAKO Pure Chemical Industrials, Ltd.) at a 1:10 enzyme:substrate ratio for 16 h at room temperature. Analytical scale digests were desalted on-line prior to ESI-MS analysis using a YMC C18 column (1 × 25 cm) on the Ultimate HPLC. The running conditions were a 120-min 0–45% acetonitrile gradient in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The mass spectra were acquired by scanning the m/z range 300–1900 in 2.05 s/scan. Preparative digests were analyzed by RP-HPLC using a Waters Alliance System (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) equipped with a YMC C18column (1 mm × 25 cm). Individual peaks were collected for further analysis. The molecular masses of peptides were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). Peptides were sequenced by Edman degradation on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Procise HT Protein Sequencer equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Nonreduced CR(ΔC)-Fc protein in phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm EDTA was treated with PNGase F and ethanol precipitated as described above. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 70% formic acid. Cyanogen bromide (10 m in acetonitrile) was added to a final concentration of 1 m, and the sample was incubated in the dark for 24 h at room temperature. The digest was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Peptides were separated by RP-HPLC on a Vydac C4 column using the following gradient (Solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; Solvent B, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid, 75% acetonitrile: 0–20% B from 0–10 min; 20–75% B from 10–120 min; and 75–100% B from 120–130 min), and collected fractions were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and Edman sequencing as described above. CNBr-generated CR peptides purified from this digest by RP-HPLC were reduced with 5 mm dithiothreitol and cleaved with Carboxypeptidase Y (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Portions of the digest were analyzed at 10-min intervals by MALDI-TOF MS. Mutagenesis of CR, threonine 88 to alanine (T88A), was accomplished by spliced overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (29Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar, 30Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). The following mutagenic primers (5′ to 3′) are the top and bottom strands creating the T88A mutation. The asterisks indicate the mutant (Thr to Ala) codon: 5′-GCCTGAATGGGGGAG*C*C*TGCATGCTGGGATCCTTTTGTGCCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGG- CACAAAAGGATCCCAGCATGCAG*G*C*TCCCCCATTCAGGC-3′. In addition to changing the threonine codon ACC to the codon for alanine, GCC, the same oligonucleotides also inserts a silent change to the sequence to introduce a BamHI site, changing the glycine 92 codon from GGG to GGA. This new site gave the ability to screen for the mutant clone. The T88A mutant was constructed in both the full-length CR (1) (CR T88A) in the pCS2+ vector (31Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) and in the C-terminally truncated CR (1) (CR(ΔC) T88A). The latter was purified as for wild type CR(ΔC) by immunoaffinity chromatography. Mouse teratocarcinoma F9 cripto−/− cells (9Minchiotti G. Parisi S. Liguori G. Signore M. Lania G. Adamson E.D.

The nodal enhancer ASE (n2)7 (15Saijoh Y. Adachi H. Sakuma R. Yeo C.Y. Yashiro K. Watanabe M. Hashiguchi H. Mochida K. Ohishi S. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Whitman M. Hamada H. Mol.

F9 cripto−/− cells (6.5 × 105 cells/well) were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Bethesda Research Laboratories) with equal amounts of FAST2 (15Saijoh Y. Adachi H. Sakuma R. Yeo C.Y. Yashiro K.

Total DNA transfected per well was always 1.0 μg, and control vector DNA (pEAG1100) was used to bring the total up to 1.0 μg. 48 h following transfection, the cells were lysed with LucLite (Packard Instrument Company), and luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cripto-dependent Nodal signaling was measured as described previously (16Yeo C.-Y. Whitman M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 32Faure S. Lee M.A. Keller T. ten Dijke P. Whitman M. Development. 2000; 127: 2917-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Xenopus embryos between cell stages 2 and 4 were used for injection. Synthetic mRNAs were injected into each blastomere in the animal hemisphere. Constructs were generated with the pCS2+ vector (31Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). RNAs were transcribed from the following constructs using the SP6 mMessage mMachine Kit (Ambion): pCS-Nodal (16Yeo C.-Y. Whitman M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), pSGS151-CR WT, pSGS904-CR T88A, and pSGS150-CR(ΔC). Ectodermal explants were isolated between stages 8 and 9 and were harvested when sibling uninjected embryos reached stage 10. The explants were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 2× Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 4 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 nmcalyculin A, 25 mm α-glycerophosphate, 100 mmsodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. After centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with equal volume of 4× Laemmli loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed as described (32Faure S. Lee M.A. Keller T. ten Dijke P. Whitman M. Development. 2000; 127: 2917-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used for Western blot analysis: anti-Smad1/5/8 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Smad2 mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 18; Transduction Laboratories), anti-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (clone AC-40; Sigma), and anti-phospho-Smad2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (32Faure S. Lee M.A. Keller T. ten Dijke P. Whitman M. Development. 2000; 127: 2917-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For detecting Cripto protein expression, the anti-Cripto antibody 1579 described above was used. When we expressed human CR in CHO cells as the full-length protein (comprising residues 1–188; Fig.1), it was produced as an insoluble membrane-associated form that was difficult to purify (data not shown). Others have reported similar difficulties in mammalian (33Brandt R. Normanno N. Gullick W.J. Lin J.H. Harkins R. Schneider D. Jones B.W. Ciardiello F. Persico M.G. Armenante F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17320-17328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bacterial (34Seno M. DeSantis M. Kannan S. Bianco C. Tada H. Kim N. Kosaka M. Gullick W.J. Yamada H. Salomon D.S. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) systems. We were able to express human CR as a soluble form by making a C-terminal truncated form analogous to that generated for the zebrafish oep (8Gritsman K. Zhang J. Cheng S. Heckscher E. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Cell. 1999; 97: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and murine Cripto (9Minchiotti G. Parisi S. Liguori G. Signore M. Lania G. Adamson E.D. Lago C.T. Persico M.G. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Consequently, we transiently expressed in CHO cells a C-terminally truncated form of human CR, comprising residues 1–169 (Fig. 1), as an Fc fusion protein (CR(ΔC)-Fc) that was efficiently secreted into the supernatant. CR(ΔC)-Fc was purified from the conditioned medium by chromatography on protein A-Sepharose. Edman N-terminal sequencing of CR(ΔC)-Fc identified a single N terminus that starts with Leu-31 (Fig. 1). This is consistent with predictions for processing of the signal peptide using the SIGNALP program (35Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). ESI-MS data for the purified CR(ΔC)-Fc gave a complex broad spectra that was not resolvable, suggesting a complex carbohydrate pattern. On SDS-PAGE, the purified CR(ΔC)-Fc migrated as two diffuse bands (Fig.2A) with apparent masses of 50 and 52 kDa. After treatment of the reduced protein with PNGase F, these two bands both shift to lower molecular masses with masses of ∼45 and 47 kDa (Fig. 2A), suggesting that both of these bands are N-glycosylated. The ESI-MS spectra of the PNGase F-treated CR(ΔC)-Fc (Fig. 2B) was less complex than the fully glycosylated protein but still showed a number of ions with masses ranging from 41116 to 42870 Da (TableI). Theoretical assignments for the nine most intense ions based on their observed masses are shown in Table I. Some of these species had measured masses that matched the predicted mass for CR(ΔC)-Fc starting at residue 31 and being modified withO-linked glycans (HexNAc-Hex-NeuAc). Peak A with an observed mass of 41116 Da agrees exactly with the theoretical mass for residues 31–396. Because antibodies frequently end with a lysine residue, the C-terminal lysine is often lost because of carboxypeptidase B activity in serum. For CR(ΔC)-Fc this is reflected in the protein forms ending at residues 396 (peaks A, B, D, F, G, and H; Fig. 2B and Table I). However, some of the glycosylated forms appear to end in the terminal lysine. In contrast, others had measured masses that did not agree with any available prediction, although the difference in mass of 146 Da for each species was consistent with the addition of a deoxyhexosyl group, potentially fucose with an average mass of 146.14 Da.Figure 2Characterization of the CR(ΔC)-Fc fusion protein. A C-terminally truncated form of CR (comprising resides 1–169) was expressed as a Fc fusion protein in CHO cells.

https://openalex.org/W2329591400,"Normal human melanocytes are interspersed singly among keratinocytes along the basement membrane of the epidermis, whereas melanoma cells readily adhere to each other during invasion of the dermis or distant organs. The tumorigenic and metastatic phenotype of melanoma cells often correlates with increased expression of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion receptors. Mel-CAM (MCAM, MUC 18, CD146) is a cell-cell adhesion receptor highly expressed by melanoma cells but not normal melanocytes. We show here that inhibition of Mel-CAM expression in metastatic melanoma cells using genetic suppressor elements of Mel-CAM cDNA leads to inhibition of adhesion between melanoma cells and to downregulation of the tumorigenic phenotype. Growth was not inhibited in genetic suppressor elements-transduced melanoma cells cultured in monolayers but was inhibited when cells were maintained anchorage-independently in soft agar and greatly reduced in immunodeficient mice. A three-dimensional epidermal skin equivalent model demonstrated that Mel-CAM allows melanoma cells to separate from the epidermis and invade the basement membrane zone and dermis. However, melanoma cells with little or no Mel-CAM were poorly invasive, possibly due to their loss of gap junctional communication. These results suggest the multifunctional role of a melanoma-associated cell-cell adhesion receptor in tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2033922593,"The D1 dopamine receptor, G protein γ7 subunit, and adenylylcyclase are selectively expressed in the striatum, suggesting their potential interaction in a common signaling pathway. To evaluate this possibility, a ribozyme strategy was used to suppress the expression of the G protein γ7 subunit in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the human D1 dopamine receptor. Prior in vitro analysis revealed that the γ7 ribozyme possessed cleavage activity directed exclusively toward the γ7 RNA transcript (Wang, Q., Mullah, B., Hansen, C., Asundi, J., and Robishaw, J. D. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26040–26048). In vivoanalysis of cells transfected with the γ7 ribozyme showed a specific reduction in the expression of the γ7 protein. Coincident with the loss of the γ7 protein, there was a noticeable reduction in the expression of the β1 protein, confirming their interaction in these cells. Finally, functional analysis of ribozyme-mediated suppression of the β1 and γ7 proteins revealed a significant attenuation of SKF81297-stimulated adenylylcyclase activity in D1 dopamine receptor-expressing cells. By contrast, ribozyme-mediated suppression of the β1 and γ7 proteins showed no reduction of SKF81297-stimulated adenylylcyclase activity in D5 dopamine receptor-expressing cells. Taken together, these data indicate that the structurally related D1 and D5 dopamine receptor subtypes utilize G proteins composed of distinct βγ subunits to stimulate adenylylcyclase in HEK 293 cells. Underscoring the physiological relevance of these findings, single cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the D1 dopamine receptor and the G protein γ7 subunit are coordinately expressed in substance P containing neurons in rat striatum, suggesting that the G protein γ7 subunit may be a new target for drugs to selectively alter dopaminergic signaling within the brain.

Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar). Studies suggest that imbalances between these two opposing classes lead to deficiencies in movement and cognitive performance (2Seeman P. Synapse. 1987; 1: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 3Davis K.L. Kahn R.S. Ko G. Davidson M. Am. J. Psych. 1991; 148: 1474-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). In particular, alterations in the D1-like dopamine receptors are implicated in a variety of neurologic and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome, and schizophrenia. Thus, achieving a better understanding of the D1-like dopamine receptors and the signaling pathways they activate may suggest more selective therapeutic targets in these diseases.The D1 and D5 dopamine receptors stimulate adenylylcyclase activity through their coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins (1Missale C.

Because the function of these heterotrimeric G proteins was originally ascribed to the α subunit, most research has focused on determining its identity. Of the several α subunits identified to date, reconstitution studies have shown that coupling of D1 dopamine receptors to adenylylcyclase can be mediated only by the αs and αolf subunits of the Gs subclass (4Herve D.

Although sharing 88% amino acid homology, the αs and αolf subunits show very divergent expression patterns, ranging from the ubiquitous expression of the αs subunit to the olfactory and neuron-specific expression of the αolf subunit (10Jones D.T. Reed R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 790-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation studies (11Tiberi M Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Consistent with such a role, 12 γ subunit genes have been identified that show extensive structural diversity (24Balcueva E.A. Wang Q. Hughes H. Kunsch C., Yu, Z. Robishaw J.D. Exp.

Methods Enyzymol. 2001; 344: 435-451Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This approach identified the γ7 subunit as a specific component of the G protein that couples the β-adrenergic receptor, but not the prostaglandin E1 receptor, to stimulation of adenylylcyclase in HEK 293 cells (23Wang Q. Mullah B. Hansen C. Asundi J. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26040-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types (27Cali J.J. Balcueva E.A. Rybalkin I. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol.

This pattern of expression is shared by the D1 dopamine receptor and adenylylcyclase (4Herve D. Levi-Strauss M. Marey-Semper I. Verney C. Tassin J.P. Glowinski J. Girault J.A. J.

In the present study, we used the ribozyme approach to identify a role for the γ7 subunit as a specific component of the G protein that couples the D1 dopamine receptor to activation of adenylylcyclase.DISCUSSIONA growing body of evidence suggests that the G protein βγ dimer composition is an important determinant for receptor recognition (15Phillips W.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26040-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, a ribozyme approach is used to provide further support for this hypothesis by showing that the closely related D1 and D5 dopamine receptors utilize distinct Gs proteins that vary in their βγ subunit composition.Ribozyme Suppression of the G Protein γ7SubunitRibozymes are powerful tools for suppressing gene expression and studying the functional consequences thereof. In the present study, ribozymes directed against the γ7 mRNA (23Wang Q. Mullah B. Hansen C. Asundi J. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26040-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were introduced into HEK 293 cell lines stably expressing either the D1 or the D5 dopamine receptor. After 72 h, the level of the γ7 protein was reduced to a similar extent in both cell lines transfected with the wild type γ7 ribozyme (Fig. 3). Attesting to the specificity of ribozyme action, the amount of the γ7 protein was not altered in both cell lines transfected with the mutant γ7ribozymes. Associated with the ribozyme-mediated loss of the γ7 protein, the level of the β1 protein was also reduced in both cell lines (Fig. 3). As shown previously, this occurs when there is not a sufficient amount of the γ7protein to dimerize with the β1 protein to prevent its degradation (23Wang Q. Mullah B. Hansen C. Asundi J. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26040-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Wang Q. Mullah B.K. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17365-17371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The expression of the αs proteins was only slightly reduced (Fig. 3). Presumably, this reflects a lesser dependence of the αs proteins on the presence of the β1γ7 subunit complex for stabilization. Although not directly examined, this is consistent with studies showing the α subunits contain their own membrane targeting signals (43Linder M.E. Kleuss C. Mumby S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 314-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of the wild type γ7 ribozyme to suppress the G protein γ7, β1, and αs proteins in that order.Dependence of the D1 Dopamine Receptor Subtype on the G Protein γ7 Subunit for Activation of Adenylylcyclase ActivityThe D1 dopamine receptor, the G protein γ7 subunit, and adenylylcyclase are highly expressed in striatum (4Herve D. Levi-Strauss M. Marey-Semper I. Verney C. Tassin J.P. Glowinski J. Girault J.A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2237-2248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Le Moine C. Normand E. Bloch B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4205-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 13Watson J.B. Coulter P.M., II Margulies J.E. de Lecea L. Danielson P.E. Erlander M.G. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci.

Science. 1990; 250: 1429-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar, 30Fremeau Jr., R.T. Duncan G.E. Fornaretto M.G. Dearry A. Gingrich J.A. Breese G.R. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6579-6591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these components may be involved in the same signaling pathway. This possibility is supported by the finding that the D1 dopamine receptor-expressing cells transfected with the wild type γ7 ribozyme showed a 32% reduction in SKF21897-induced cAMP accumulation (Fig. 4A). Because the reduced cAMP response was not observed in cells transfected with the two mutant γ7 ribozymes, this strongly argues that the attenuated response was due to the specific loss of the γ7 subunit and its binding partners rather than a nonspecific effect of the γ7 ribozyme. Other possible nonspecific effects of the wild type γ7 ribozyme were also ruled out. Thus, the wild type γ7 ribozyme did not reduce the D1dopamine receptor content (150 ± 8 fmol/5 × 105cells for control cells, and 205 ± 77 fmol/5 × 105 for cells transfected with wild type γ7ribozyme), indicating that there was no defect in the receptor upstream of the G protein. Moreover, the ribozyme did not alter the cAMP response to the prostaglandin receptor agonist, prostaglandin E1 (108 ± 8% of control), confirming that there was no defect in the effector downstream of the G protein (Fig.4A). Taken together, these results indicate that the G protein γ7 subunit participates in signal transduction between the D1 dopamine receptor and adenylylcyclase in this model system. Moreover, because loss of the γ7subunit was associated with a similar reduction in β1subunit, a participatory role of the β1 subunit in this same pathway is suggested.Although the present study does not directly address the role of the G protein β1 and γ7 subunits, two possible mechanisms are suggested. First, it is known from previous studies that the βγ dimer itself can regulate certain types of adenylylcyclases (44Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In this scenario, the ribozyme-mediated loss of the β1γ7 dimer might compromise the regulation of adenylylcyclase activity, thereby accounting for the attenuated cAMP response. However, the finding that HEK 293 cells do not express βγ-regulated form of adenylylcyclase appears to argue against this scenario (44Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). 2J. D. Robishaw, unpublished observations. Second, it is known from previous studies that a receptor requires the combined interaction of the G protein αβγ heterotrimer (19Figler R.A. Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Yasuda H. Linden J. Garrison J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1587-1595PubMed Google Scholar, 21Richardson M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13525-13533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this scenario, the ribozyme-mediated loss of the β1γ7 dimer would lead to reduced assembly of the required G αsβ1γ7heterotrimer. At this point, we favor this scenario. Because the G αsβ1γ7 heterotrimer is required for activation by the D1 dopamine receptor, the net effect would be to disrupt activation of adenylylcyclase activity. The question then arises as to why D1 dopamine receptor activation of adenylylcyclase was only partially attenuated. An obvious explanation relates to the transient transfection nature of these studies. Because only 70% of the cells were transfected with the γ7 ribozyme (23Wang Q. Mullah B. Hansen C. Asundi J. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26040-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the remaining 30% of the cells that were not transfected would be expected to show a normal cAMP response to SKF81297.Lack of Dependence of the D5 Dopamine Receptor Subtype on the G Protein γ7 Subunit for Activation of Adenylylcyclase ActivityBoth D1 and D5dopamine receptor-expressing cell lines contained a similar number of receptors in the plasma membrane and showed comparable levels of SKF81297-stimulated cAMP accumulation (compare Fig. 1). Nevertheless, the D5 dopamine receptor-expressing cell line transfected with the wild type γ7 ribozyme showed no attenuation of SKF21897-induced cAMP accumulation compared with the 32% reduction observed in the D1 dopamine receptor-expressing cell line (Fig. 4). That this difference is real is shown by the similar reduction in the levels of the γ7, β1, and αs proteins in both cell lines (Fig. 3) and by the the comparable attenuation in the levels of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results are most consistent with the notion that the D1 and D5dopamine receptor subtypes recruit different Gsheterotrimers to mediate this response. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the D1 dopamine receptor interacts with a form of Gs containing the β1 and γ7subunits, whereas the D5 dopamine receptor interacts with a form of Gs containing a different combination of β and γ subunits.Implications for Specificity of the D1 and D5 Dopamine Receptor Signaling Pathways in VivoThe results obtained from this heterologous expression system are intriguing because they point to intrinsic differences between the two receptor subtypes in terms of their G protein coupling properties. Future structure-function mapping of the two receptor subtypes should allow the molecular basis for this to be identified. In this regard, fluorescence energy transfer (15Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17032-17039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cross-linking (16Taylor J.M. Jacob-Mosier G.G. Lowton R.G. VanFort M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 3336-3339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar) studies have identified direct interactions between receptor and the G protein βγ dimer. Although cross-linking studies have yet to identify contact site(s) between the receptor and the γ subunit, numerous reconstitution studies have underscored the importance of the carboxyl-terminal region of the γ subunit in receptor recognition, with both primary structure and type of prenyl group contributing to the specificity (17Kisselev O.G. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25356-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Richardson M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13525-13533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, these results lay the groundwork for more precisely identifying the molecular determinants specifying the differential interaction of the D1 and D5dopamine receptors with the γ7 subunit and, ultimately, in designing tools to selectively disrupt their individual signaling pathways.On the other hand, we recognize that results obtained from a heterologous expression system do not constitute proof that the D1 dopamine receptor subtype interacts with a form of Gs containing the γ7 subunit in a native system. However, in support of this possibility, we used reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of individual, striatal neurons (31Surmeier D.J. Song W.J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6579-6591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Tkatch T. Baranauskas G. Surmeier D.J. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1935-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to show that the D1 dopamine receptor and G protein γ7 subunit are predominantly and coordinately expressed in SP containing neurons that project to the substantia nigra par reticulata. Intriguingly, the Gng7 locus encoding the G protein γ7 subunit has been localized to mouse chromosome 10 in the vicinity of several neurological mutations, such as jittery, Ames Waltzer, and mocha (13Watson J.B. Coulter P.M., II Margulies J.E. de Lecea L. Danielson P.E. Erlander M.G. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, on the basis of these findings, the G protein γ7 subunit should be considered as a candidate for these and other genetic disorders that map near this region in the future. Dopaminergic signaling in brain is mediated by five receptor subtypes that can be grouped into D1-like (D1and D5) and D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) classes based on pharmacological and physiological criteria (1Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar). Studies suggest that imbalances between these two opposing classes lead to deficiencies in movement and cognitive performance (2Seeman P. Synapse. 1987; 1: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 3Davis K.L. Kahn R.S. Ko G. Davidson M. Am. J. Psych. 1991; 148: 1474-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). In particular, alterations in the D1-like dopamine receptors are implicated in a variety of neurologic and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome, and schizophrenia. Thus, achieving a better understanding of the D1-like dopamine receptors and the signaling pathways they activate may suggest more selective therapeutic targets in these diseases. The D1 and D5 dopamine receptors stimulate adenylylcyclase activity through their coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins (1Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar, 4Herve D. Levi-Strauss M. Marey-Semper I. Verney C. Tassin J.P. Glowinski J. Girault J.A. J.

Because the function of these heterotrimeric G proteins was originally ascribed to the α subunit, most research has focused on determining its identity. Of the several α subunits identified to date, reconstitution studies have shown that coupling of D1 dopamine receptors to adenylylcyclase can be mediated only by the αs and αolf subunits of the Gs subclass (4Herve D.

Although sharing 88% amino acid homology, the αs and αolf subunits show very divergent expression patterns, ranging from the ubiquitous expression of the αs subunit to the olfactory and neuron-specific expression of the αolf subunit (10Jones D.T. Reed R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 790-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation studies (11Tiberi M Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have confirmed the interaction between the αs subunit and the D1 dopamine receptors in cells, whereas in situ hybridization (12Le Moine C.

We have observed that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is very sensitive to lithium when growing in galactose medium. In this work we show that lithium inhibits with high affinity yeast (IC50 ∼ 0.2 mm) and human (IC50 ∼ 1.5 mm) phosphoglucomutase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of glucose 1-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate. Lithium inhibits the rate of fermentation when yeast are grown in galactose and induces accumulation of glucose 1-phosphate and galactose 1-phosphate. Accumulation of these metabolites was also observed when a strain deleted of the two isoforms of phosphoglucomutase was incubated in galactose medium. In glucose-grown cells lithium reduces the steady state levels of UDP-glucose, resulting in a defect on trehalose and glycogen biosynthesis. Lithium acts as a competitive inhibitor of yeast phosphoglucomutase activity by competing with magnesium, a cofactor of the enzyme. High magnesium concentrations revert lithium inhibition of growth and phosphoglucomutase activity. Lithium stress causes an increase of the phosphoglucomutase activity due to an induction of transcription of the PGM2 gene, and its overexpression confers lithium tolerance in galactose medium. These results show that phosphoglucomutase is an important in vivo lithium target. Lithium is a drug frequently used in the treatment of manic depressive disorder.

Despite its frequent clinical use, the molecular mechanism underlying its action is poorly understood. Some of the hypotheses implicate central cellular signal transduction pathways (3Manji H.K.

Cell. 1989; 59: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Another enzyme involved in signal transduction inhibited by lithium is the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (9Klein P.S.

Additionally, other enzymes not related directly to signal transduction are known to be inhibited by lithium such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) from rabbit (20Nakashima K. Tuboi S. J. Biol.

Interestingly, it was shown that IMPases, IPPases, FBPases, and BPNases share a structural motif responsible for lithium binding (27York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5149-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an eukaryotic cell model to study mechanisms of lithium action. We have observed previously (28Masuda C.A. Ramı́rez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that lithium is very toxic to yeast cells growing in medium with galactose as the sole carbon source. Galactose is metabolized in yeast, as in humans, by the Leloir pathway (29Kosterlitz F.W. Biochem. J. 1943; 37: 322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Leloir L.F. Arch.

This pathway (Fig. 1) consists of a series of reactions catalyzed by galactokinase (GK), galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT), and UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (GALE) that transform galactose to glucose 1-phosphate (Glc-1-P). In yeast, theGAL1, GAL7, and GAL10 genes encode these enzymes, respectively (32Robichon-Szulmajster H. Science. 1958; 127: 28-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33Douglas H.C. Hawthorne D.C. Genetics. 1964; 49: 837-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then, PGM, which is encoded in yeast by the genes GAL5/PGM2 and PGM1 (34Douglas H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 52: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Oh D. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1415-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Boles E. Liebetrau W.

The genes GAL1, GAL7, GAL10, andGAL5, together with GAL2 gene, which encodes a galactose permease (37Douglas H.C. Condie F. J. Bacteriol. 1954; 68: 662-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are regulated by the transcription factor Gal4p and the transcription regulator Gal80p, being induced by galactose and repressed by glucose (35Oh D. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1415-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Johnston M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Fu L. Bounelis P. Dey N. Browne B.L. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3087-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations that affects any of these enzymes causes a growth deficiency in galactose (32Robichon-Szulmajster H. Science. 1958; 127: 28-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33Douglas H.C.

We present evidences that PGM is an in vivo target of lithium responsible for the galactose-specific lithium toxicity. We also show that human PGM activity is inhibited by lithium. Possible involvement of PGM in the mechanism of lithium action in humans is discussed. Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue was used for plasmid construction. S. cerevisiae JF291 (Matα, leu2, 3–112, his3–1, ura3–52, PGM1, PGM2) and JF645 (Matα, leu2, 3–112, his3–1, ura3–52, pgm2Δ::HIS3, pgm1Δ::KanR) (40Daran J.M. Bell W. François J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 153: 89-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) strains were a kind gift from Dr. J. M. François. FY833 (Mata, his3Δ200, ura3–52, leu2Δ1, lys2Δ202, trp1Δ63, GAL2+) was a kind gift from Dr. M. Ghislain. Expression plasmid pVRH3 (a gift from Dr. S. Verjovski-Almeida) is a multicopy plasmid with the strong promoter and the 3′-untranslated region from the yeast PMA1 gene. PGM2 open reading frame was amplified from yeast genomic DNA by PCR usingPfu DNA polymerase from 50 bp upstream of the start codon to 23 bp downstream of the stop codon using the primers PGM2f (5′-agggagctcaggatcaaccaatatttctcagt-3′) and PGM2r (5′-cgggatccaagccattagtaaatcattcgt-3′). PCR products were cloned in pBlueScript II SK+ using BamHI and SacI restriction enzyme sites introduced in the primers. The open reading frame was subcloned to pVRH3 expression vector using the same restriction enzyme sites (pPGM2). Yeast strains JF-pVRH3 and JF-PGM2 were constructed by transforming JF291 strain with plasmids pVRH3 and pPGM2, respectively, by the lithium acetate method (41Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strain XL1-Blue was grown in LB medium with or without 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Yeast strains were selected in minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base) containing 2% of either glucose or galactose and the appropriate amino acids. After selection, they were grown in rich YP medium containing 2% Bacto-peptone, 1% yeast extract, and either 2% sugars or 3% glycerol or ethanol. When solid medium was used, 2% agar was added. Lithium (LiCl) and magnesium (MgCl2) were added at the indicated concentrations. Yeast cells were grown in liquid YPGal or YPGly medium to mid-log phase and diluted toA600 of 0.3, 0.03, and 0.003. 4 μl of each dilution were dropped in the appropriate medium. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2–4 days and photographed. Extraction of metabolites was done based on previously published protocols (42Entian K.-D. Zimmermann F.K. Scheel I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 156: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 43Gonzalez B. François J. Renaud M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown as described, and aliquots of the culture were collected by rapid vacuum filtration in 0.45-μm Millipore filters. Cells were immediately transferred to 75% ethanol at 80 °C and incubated for 3 min. Samples were lyophilized, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was analyzed by high pH anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC), using a Dionex DX 500 system equipped with a CarboPac PA10 column (4 × 250 mm). Samples (25 μl) were applied and eluted with a stepwise gradient of 125 mm sodium acetate in 100 mm NaOH for 15 min and then with 180 mm sodium acetate in 100 mm NaOH for 30 min in a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For UDP-glucose measurements, metabolites were extracted as described above except that lyophilized material was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer containing 200 mm Tris, pH 8.9, 5 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm NAD+ (44Koo S.J. Neal J.C. DiTomaso J.M. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). UDP-glucose content was determined by measuringA340 before and after addition of 0.01 unit of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (Sigma) into the solution. Yeast cells were grown in YPGal to mid-log phase. Cells were harvested and washed with an equal amount of distilled water and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml chymostatin). An equal amount of 0.5 mm acid-washed glass beads was added, and cells were lysed by vortexing six times for 1 min followed by a 1-min rest on ice. The lysate was collected to another tube and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20% (v/v). Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −70 °C until use. HEK293 cells (kindly provided by Dr. H. Wolosker) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum in 100-mm dishes at 37 °C with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were scrapped from dishes and collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 600 mm sucrose, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 μg/ml amounts of each protease inhibitor (aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin). Cells were lysed in a Teflon pestle tissue homogenizer with 30 strokes on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Supernatant was collected, and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%. Aliquots were frozen at −70 °C until use. PGM and GK activity were measured using coupled systems basically as described (45Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1986Google Scholar). Briefly, for measuring PGM activity, an extract of yeast soluble proteins (50 μg/ml) was incubated at 23 °C in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm NAD+, 2 units/ml recombinant Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 1 mm MgCl2 unless otherwise stated. The reaction was started by the addition of 4 mmglucose 1-phosphate, and NADH formation was monitored by followingA340. PGM activity is represented as micromoles of Glc-6-P mg−1 min−1 (units/mg) or as percentage of the control point. GK activity was measured by incubating an extract of yeast soluble protein (50 μg/ml) at 23 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm NADH, 1 mm ATP, and 7/10 units/ml pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase enzyme mixture. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 mm galactose, and NADH oxidation was monitored by following A340. GK activity is represented as μmol of Gal-1-P mg−1 min−1 (units/mg). Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (46Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Trehalose and glycogen content were determined as described (47Parrou J.L. François J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The fermentation rate was measured by monitoring ethanol production (45Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1986Google Scholar, 48Ramı́rez J. Ramı́rez O. Saldaña C. Coria R. Peña A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase (A600 ∼ 1.0) in YPGal or YPD medium and washed twice with water. Cells were resuspended in water and incubated for another 4 h at 30 °C with shaking. Fermentation was measured by incubating cells in buffer containing 50 mmglucose or 50 mm galactose in 5 mmMES-triethanolamine, pH 6.0. Yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase (A600 ∼ 1.0) in YPGal, and 15 mmLiCl was added to the culture. Aliquots of the culture were collected at different time intervals. 10 μg of total cellular RNA (49Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar) were separated in a formaldehyde-denaturing agarose gel (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon-N+ membrane, UV-cross-linked, and pre-hybridized with 6× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Probes for PGM1, PGM2, and ACT1 genes were amplified from yeast genomic DNA by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase. Primers PGM1fc (5′-ataggcgtaaccctgaaaagg-3′) and PGM1r (5′-cgggatccggaaaattagtgcttgttcaagac-3′) were used to producePGM1 probe (+1226 bp from the ATG to +32 bp downstream the stop codon). To produce PGM2 probe (+1222 bp from ATG to +23 bp from the stop codon), primers PGM2fc (5′-aacaagcatcatccggagaac-3′) and PGM2r were used in the reaction. ACT1 probe was amplified as described previously (28Masuda C.A. Ramı́rez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Probes were labeled using random primers. Hybridization occurred at 65 °C in 6× SSPE, 0.5% SDS, and >1 × 106 cpm/ml of the corresponding probe for at least 16 h. Membranes were washed one time with 0.2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min and two times at 65 °C for 15 min and exposed to Kodak X-AR5 autoradiographic film with intensifying screen for 2–10 days at −70 °C. We have observed previously (28Masuda C.A. Ramı́rez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that lithium is more toxic to yeast cells growing in galactose medium compared with yeast growing in glucose. This result was intriguing since it was observed that ENA1 gene, which expression is one of the main determinants of lithium and sodium tolerance in yeast (51Serrano R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 165: 1-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is under glucose repression presenting a 10-fold higher level in galactose compared with glucose (52Alepuz P.M. Cunningham K.W. Estruch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this work, we have tested other repressing and non-repressing carbon sources for lithium tolerance. Wild type yeast strain JF291 was grown in rich (YP) medium containing several different carbon sources in the presence or absence of 30 mm LiCl. Fig. 2 shows that yeast cells can grow well in the presence of 30 mmLiCl in all carbon sources tested (see Fig. 2 legend), but not in galactose. This result indicates that the toxicity is galactose-specific and not related to glucose repression. It had been shown that Hal2p/Met22p, the yeast BPNase, is one of the main targets of lithium in yeast growing in glucose medium (24Murguı́a J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 53Murguı́a J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. J. Biol.

In the absence of methionine, inhibition of Hal2p by lithium causes an accumulation of its substrate 3′,5′-bisphosphoadenosine (53Murguı́a J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29029-29033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which is toxic to cells (54Dicht B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). High 3′,5′-bisphosphoadenosine concentrations inhibit RNase MRP and Xrn1p, thus inhibiting RNA processing (54Dicht B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). All these effects are reverted by addition of methionine in culture medium (54Dicht B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 55Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola R. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We observed that addition of methionine did not confer any detectable protection against lithium toxicity in galactose medium (data not shown). Thus, the galactose-specific lithium toxicity is not related to the inhibition of Hal2p/Met22p. Galactose is metabolized in yeast by the Leloir pathway (29Kosterlitz F.W. Biochem. J. 1943; 37: 322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Leloir L.F. Arch. Biochem. 1951; 33: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which converts galactose to Glc-1-P that is further converted to Glc-6-P to enter glycolysis (Fig. 1). In Fig.3A, we show an HPAEC analysis of some of the intermediate metabolites of this pathway (Gal-1-P, Glc-1-P, and Glc-6-P) extracted from a wild type yeast cell growing in YPGal medium in the absence or presence of 30 mm LiCl. Lithium induces a large accumulation of Gal-1-P and Glc-1-P and a small decrease in Glc-6-P levels. No change in the steady state levels of trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre-6-P) and mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) was detected. This result could be explained by inhibition of PGM, the enzyme that converts Glc-1-P to Glc-6-P. To test this hypothesis, we assayed the yeast PGM activity in vitro in the presence of increasing lithium concentrations. We show (Fig. 3B) that lithium inhibits with high affinity (IC50 of 200 μm in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2) the yeast PGM activity and that sodium and potassium inhibit only at very high concentrations (IC50 > 50 mm). This inhibition is not caused by Cl− anion since other Li+, Na+, and K+ salts have the same effect (data not shown). Conversion of Glc-1-P to Glc-6-P is an essential step for glycolysis when yeast cells are growing with galactose as the sole carbon source (see Fig. 1). However, when growing with glucose, glycolysis does not depend on PGM activity. We measured the fermentation rate in both carbon sources. In glucose, the fermentation rate was 66.4 ± 16.0 and 63.0 ± 15.4 (nmol ethanol/min/mg dry weight) in the absence or presence of 100 mm LiCl, respectively. In galactose, the fermentation rate was 44.6 ± 3.6 and 4.3 ± 2.2 (nmol ethanol/min/mg dry weight) in the absence or presence of 15 mm LiCl, respectively. Galactose fermentation is very sensitive to lithium, whereas glucose fermentation is not inhibited. These results indicate that lithium inhibits both in vitroand in vivo the yeast PGM activity. It had been shown that lithium inhibits rabbit PGM by displacing magnesium, a cofactor of the enzyme, from its binding site (22Ray Jr., W.J. Szymanki E.S. Ng L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 522: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Rhyu G.I. Ray Jr., W.J. Markley J.L. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As we can see in Fig.4A, increasing the magnesium concentration protects PGM activity from lithium inhibition. Fig.4B shows the Dixon plot of the same experiment that presents a pattern typical of a competitive inhibition. From this plot we can also calculate an apparent Ki for lithium of ∼60 μm. Neither the substrate Glc-1-P nor glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, an activator of the enzyme, protects PGM activity from lithium inhibition (data not shown). It was shown that high potassium concentration could protect yeast BPNase activity (Hal2p) from lithium inhibition (24Murguı́a J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, addition of 100 mmKCl in the assay medium had no effect on PGM activity in the presence of lithium (data not shown). We also show that the addition of 100 mm MgCl2to YPGal medium protects yeast cells from lithium toxicity (Fig.4C). In order to determine if the reversion of lithium toxicity conferred by magnesium is a consequence of a protection of the PGM activity in vivo, we have analyzed the intermediate metabolites of the Leloir pathway. Metabolites from wild type yeast cells grown in YPGal medium with 10 mm lithium in the presence or absence of 100 mm MgCl2 were extracted and analyzed by HPAEC. Fig. 4D shows that addition of magnesium prevents the accumulation of Gal-1-P and Glc-1-P induced by lithium. These results clearly demonstrate that adding magnesium to the growth medium is able to prevent lithium inhibition of PGM activityin vivo. Boles and co-workers (36Boles E. Liebetrau W. Hofmann M. Zimmermann F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) had shown previously that PGM activity is essential for yeast growth in galactose medium, but not in glucose or glycerol plus ethanol. We have extended this study to other carbon sources. Fig.5A shows that thepgm1pgm2 mutant grows in all carbon sources tested except galactose. This pattern is identical to that observed for wild type strains growing in the presence of 30 mm LiCl (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we have analyzed the intermediate metabolites of galactose metabolism in the pgm1pgm2 double mutant strain incubated in YPGal medium and observed higher steady-state levels of Gal-1-P and Glc-1-P compared with a wild type strain (Fig. 5B). This result is similar to that observed for yeast grown in the presence of lithium (Fig. 3A). Unlike from what we had observed with lithium, magnesium could not protect this mutant from the growth defect in galactose (data not shown). These results indicate that inhibition of PGM activity is a major cause of lithium toxicity to yeast in galactose. Yeast PGM expression is modulated by many different external stimuli such as heat shock, DNA damage (56Peng Z-Y. Trumbly R.J. Reinmann E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13871-13877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), oxidative stress (57Posas F. Clotet J. Ariño J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and carbon source (35Oh D. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell.

To address whether PGM expression is induced by lithium stress, we have analyzed the mRNA levels of the two yeast genes (PGM1and PGM2) encoding PGM by Northern blotting. Fig.6 shows that expression of thePGM2 gene is highly induced within 20 and 40 min of lithium addition. The level of PGM2 mRNA decreases after 60 min, but is still higher than that of the co"

We demonstrate that the two proteins interact using calmodulin binding regions of both proteins. A recombinant protein representing amino acids 1393–1527 (D1393–1527) of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the skeletal muscle L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel binds Ca2+, Ca2+ calmodulin, and apocalmodulin. In the absence of calmodulin, D1393–1527 binds to both RYR1 and a peptide representing the calmodulin binding site of RYR1 (amino acids 3609–3643). In addition, biotinylated R3609–3643 peptide can be used with streptavidin beads to pull down [3H]PN200–110-labeled L-type channels from detergent-solubilized transverse tubule membranes. The binding of the L-type channel carboxyl-terminal tail to the calmodulin binding site on RYR1 may stabilize the contact between the two proteins, provide a mechanism for Ca2+ and/or calmodulin regulation of their interaction, or participate directly in functional signaling between these two proteins. A unique aspect of this study is the finding that calmodulin binding sequences can serve as specific binding motifs for proteins other than calmodulin.

The interaction between these two proteins has been suggested to involve an orthograde signal, whereby the DHPR signals RYR1 to open, and a retrograde signal, whereby RYR1 prevents L-type channel inactivation (1Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The interactions between these two proteins are, however, likely to be complex, involve more than one domain, and be subject to allosteric modulations. One approach to mapping interaction sites on RYR1 and the L-type channel has been to prepare chimeras of RYR1 and RYR2 (2Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Rando T.A. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or α1Cand α1sk subunits of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (3Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This approach is based on the findings that RYR1 but not RYR2 can restore mechanical coupling in RYR1-deficient (dyspedic) myotubes (2Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Rando T.A. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and α1sk but not α1C can restore skeletal-type excitation-contraction coupling in DHPR-deficient (dysgenic) myotubes (3Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 4Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Using this approach the II-III loop of the L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunit was shown to be required for mechanical excitation-contraction coupling. A region between amino acids 1635–2636 of RYR1 was found to be required for both orthograde and retrograde signaling, whereas a second region from amino acid residues 2659–3720 of RYR1 contributed to retrograde signaling (2Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Rando T.A. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The assembly of four dihydropyridine receptors (a tetrad) above a single ryanodine receptor appears to require the region from 2659 to 3720 of RYR1 (5Fessenden J.D. Moore R.A. Wang Y. Nakai J. Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Biophysical J. 1999; 76: 394Google Scholar). It is unlikely that a chimeric approach can identify all regions of interaction between these two proteins. Multiple sites of contact between these two proteins are likely, some to stabilize the complex and others to regulate the activity of the two ion channels. Highly conserved regions that participate in these binding events would be missed in the chimeric approach. In addition, exchanging domains that alter the conformation of one or both proteins could lead to a false assignment of that region as an interaction domain. Identification of the contact sites could also be limited by the affinity of the binding events. Functional interactions would be expected to be low affinity, because this coupling would need to change rapidly in response to the transverse tubule depolarization signals. In addition, the immobilization of these two proteins to the triadic regions would serve to make the effective local concentration of each protein high. Therefore, high affinity binding would not be needed, even for stabilization of the complex. Other regions of both the L-type channel and RYR1 have been suggested to contribute to the coupling between these two proteins (6Slavik K. Wang J.P. Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Mandel F. Malouf N. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1475-C1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1487–1506 in the carboxyl terminus of the α1subunit inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal and cardiac SR membranes, and the activity of skeletal muscle SR membranes reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers (6Slavik K. Wang J.P. Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Mandel F. Malouf N. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1475-C1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest an interaction of this highly conserved carboxyl-terminal region of the DHPR α1 subunit with RYR1. Based on these findings, we chose to explore the possibility of an interaction of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the α1 subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel with RYR1. The cDNA encoding the skeletal DHPR amino acids α11393–1527 (D1393–1527) with a 5′ end EcoRV and 3′ endXhoI restriction site was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The amplified fragment was verified by DNA sequencing and then cloned in-frame intoEcoRV-XhoI sites of the pET32a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), resulting in a plasmid that encodes a His-tagged DHPR (1393–1527) fusion protein with thioredoxin. This plasmid was transformed into BL21-CodonPlusTM (DE3)-RP or RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) Escherichia coli strain. A 1-liter liquid culture of the transformed bacteria cells was grown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.5 and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 8 h. Expressed fusion protein was purified as described by Schumacher et al. (8Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bacteria were pelleted, and the pellet was resuspended in TN buffer (60 ml of 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl) containing 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme. The resuspended pellet was sonicated three times for 10 s and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was solubilized in 60 ml of TN buffer containing 1.5%N-lauroylsarcosine. The sample was then dialyzed extensively with buffer to remove the N-lauroylsarcosine detergent. The solubilized fusion protein was loaded onto a metal affinity column (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). After extensive washing, the His tag was cleaved with recombinant enterokinase (Novagen), and the D1393–1527 fragment was eluted in the column buffer. The first 20 amino acid residues of the D1393–1527 protein were verified by amino-terminal sequencing in the Protein Sequencing Core Facility at Baylor College of Medicine. The fusion protein and the cleaved D1393–1527 were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The interaction between D1393–1527 and either Ca2+CaM or R3614–43 was assessed by monitoring the changes in tryptophan fluorescence of D1393–1527. Data were collected on a SpectraMax Gemini fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Tryptophan excitation was set at 280 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 310 to 400 nm. Final fluorescence data were obtained by subtracting CaM, R3614–43, or buffer effects from those of the D1393–1527 target-protein complex. Under these conditions, the observed fluorescence is attributed to the tryptophan residues of D1393–1527. The binding of the lanthamide, terbium(III), was determined by incubating D1393–1527 (1.2 μm) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mNaCl with Chelex resin 100 (Bio-Rad) for 15 min at room temperature. The Chelex resin was removed by centrifugation before lanthanide metal ion terbium(III) binding. Fluorescence of terbium(III) binding was recorded on an ISS PCI photon counting spectrophotometer (Champaign, IL). D1393–1527 in the presence of 0, 1, or 2 mm terbium (III) chloride was excited at 280 nm (UV solar pass filter), and the emission spectra (525–575 nm) were recorded with a filter of 495 nm. SR membranes (20 μg) were incubated for 16 h at room temperature with 20 nm[3H]ryanodine in the absence or presence of 1 μm D1393–1527 in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 10 μmcold ryanodine. Bound ryanodine was separated from free ryanodine by filtering through GF/F filters. We expressed a 15.3-kDa fragment (amino acids 1393–1527 of the rabbit sequence) of the carboxyl terminus of the L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunit. This region contains the putative Ca2+ binding E-F hand (9Zuhlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), CaM binding region A (10Pitt G.S. Zuhlke R.D. Hudmon A. Schulman H. Reuter H. Tsien R.W. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). To obtain this fragment, we subcloned the DNA coding for amino acids 1393–1527 of the α1subunit of the skeletal L-type channel into a pET32a vector and expressed it in E. coli. Fig.1A shows the purified fusion protein and the protein (D1393–1527) obtained after enterokinase cleavage. Because this region of the DHPR contains a putative E-F hand, it could bind Ca2+. We examined the ability of the expressed fragment to bind Ca2+ by assessing its ability to bind terbium(III). Terbium(III), a lanthanide, is frequently found to bind to the calcium binding sites often with a much higher affinity for these sites than Ca2+ (13Brittain H.G. Richardson F.S. Martin R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 8255-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The addition of D1393–1527 significantly enhances the terbium fluorescence (Fig. 1B). Ca2+ partially inhibits this fluorescence increase. The inability of 10 mm Ca2+ to completely block terbium binding presumably reflects the much higher affinity of terbium for this binding site. These studies demonstrate that D1393–1527, in the absence of calmodulin, can bind Ca2+, presumably to the E-F hand. It should be noted, however, that Soldatov and co-workers (14Romanin C. Gamsjaeger R. Kahr H. Schaufler D. Carlson O. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have suggested that the amino acids 1601–1616 of the corresponding cardiac sequence represent a low affinity Ca2+ binding site. Calmodulin can bind and regulate both the L-type Ca2+channel (15Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H.

Three regions of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the L-type Ca2+channel α1 subunit, designated A (10Pitt G.S. Zuhlke R.D. Hudmon A. Schulman H. Reuter H. Tsien R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30794-30802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), CB (11Pate P. Mochca-Morales J. Wu Y. Zhang J.Z. Rodney G.G. Serysheva I.I. Williams B.Y. Anderson M.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39786-39792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and IQ (9Zuhlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), have been implicated in the binding of calmodulin. We assessed the ability of D1393–1527 to bind calmodulin in the nanomolar and micromolar Ca2+ concentrations. The interaction was first assessed using changes in the inherent tryptophan fluorescence. The binding of Ca2+ calmodulin to D1393–1527 produced an increase and a blue shift in the inherent tryptophan fluorescence of the expressed protein (Fig. 1C). The change in signal, however, was much less with the Ca2+-free form of CaM (apoCaM) (data not shown). This could indicate either a lack of interaction or that the tryptophans in D1393–1527 are not located near the apoCaM binding site. To determine whether apoCaM binds to D1393–1527, we developed an assay to capture apoCaM using the fusion protein, Talon beads (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and a fluorescent derivative of CaM, Alexa CaM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). As seen in Fig. 1D, D1393–1527, which lacks the IQ motif, binds both apocalmodulin and Ca2+ calmodulin. These findings suggest that at least parts of both the apoCaM and Ca2+CaM binding sites in the carboxyl tail of the L-type channel are located outside of the IQ motif. This is consistent with the results of Pitt et al. (10Pitt G.S. Zuhlke R.D. Hudmon A. Schulman H. Reuter H. Tsien R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30794-30802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the carboxyl tail of the DHPR α1subunit interacts with the intact RYR1, we analyzed the effect of D1393–1527 on [3H]ryanodine binding to SR membranes. We had shown previously that a peptide representing amino acids 1484–1509 of the L-type channel, later designated CB (11Pate P. Mochca-Morales J. Wu Y. Zhang J.Z. Rodney G.G. Serysheva I.I. Williams B.Y. Anderson M.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39786-39792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), interacted with the skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel to inhibit both channel activity and [3H]ryanodine binding (6Slavik K. Wang J.P. Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Mandel F. Malouf N. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1475-C1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence is within the D1393–1527 expressed fragment. As shown in Fig.2A, D1393–1527 also inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding to RYR1 with an IC50 of 1.9 μm. This is higher affinity than found with the CaM binding peptide representing amino acids 1484–1509 of the skeletal muscle α1 subunit L-type channel and 1627–1652 of the cardiac L-type channel alone, suggesting that other regions in this sequence, in addition to CB, are contributing to its affinity for RYR1. These data support an interaction of the carboxyl tail of the α1 subunit with the intact RYR1. The carboxyl-terminal tail of the DHPRα1 subunit is apparently able to bind to RYR1. To identify the DHPR α1carboxyl tail binding site on RYR1, we first examined some of the RYR1 synthetic peptides that we had prepared previously. Only one peptide was found to interact with the DHPR. The binding sites for both Ca2+ calmodulin and apocalmodulin in RYR1 are found in the region between amino acids 3614 and 3643 (21Moore C.P. Zhang J.-Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36831-36834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We prepared a 4.2-kDa synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 3609–3643 on RYR1 (designated R3609–3643) and tested to see whether this peptide could bind to D1393–1527 by assessing changes in tryptophan fluorescence. This is shown in Fig. 2B. The addition of R3609–3643 to D1393–1527 produced a strong enhancement and a blue shift in the tryptophan fluorescence of the D1393–1527. These traces are corrected for the intrinsic fluorescence of R3609–43. Fig. 2C shows the effect of increasing concentrations of R3609–3643 on the fluorescence. The half-maximal concentration of the peptide is 0.9 μm. These findings suggest that this region of the L-type channel may interact with RYR1 at the CaM binding site on RYR1. An interaction can also be detected at < 10 nmCa2+ concentrations (data not shown). To determine whether these interactions occur with native DHPR, we synthesized a biotinylated form of R3609–3643 (designated R3609–3643-biotin) and assessed the ability of streptavidin beads in the presence of R3609–3643-biotin to pull down [3H]PN200–110-labeled DHPR from detergent-solubilized transverse tubule membranes. The non-biotinylated peptide, R3609–3643, was used as a control. As can be seen in Fig.3A, R3609–3643-biotin can pull down the [3H]PN200–110-labeled DHPR, but R3609–3643 cannot. Fig. 3B shows a Western blot of these pulldown fractions using an antibody to the α1 subunit of the DHPR. Both R3609–3643 and the DHPR bind calmodulin. If the interaction between the peptide and the protein involve CaM binding domains, CaM should prevent their interaction. As shown in this figure, the binding of the DHPR to the beads was blocked by 50 μmcalmodulin (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 5). The interaction is also blocked by suramin (data not shown), a drug that blocks calmodulin binding to RYR1 (22Klinger M. Bofill-Cardona E. Mayer B. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Hohenegger M. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In summary, we have found that a highly conserved region of the L-type channel (amino acids 1393–1527) can interact with RYR1 in a novel fashion that utilizes regions around the calmodulin binding sites on both proteins. The CaM binding peptides from DHPR (A and CB) do not appear to interact directly with the CaM binding peptide from RYR1 (R3609–3643) (data not shown), suggesting that the CaM binding regions are each binding to additional, as yet unidentified, sites near the CaM binding sites on each protein. This type of redundancy in the role of CaM binding sequences may be a more general phenomenon. CaM kinase has overlapping autoinhibitory and CaM binding domains, such that the binding of CaM to the kinase relieves the inhibition that arises from the intramolecular interaction (reviewed in Ref. 23Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In other words, one sequence is serving two functional roles. This is similar to what we are proposing for the CaM binding domains on both RYR1 and the DHPR. A role for the CaM binding region of RYR1 in mechanical coupling is consistent with the data of Nakai et al. (2Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Rando T.A. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These workers showed that the chimera with amino acid residues 2659–3720 of RYR1 inserted into RYR2 enhanced t-tubule Ca2+ channel function and prevented L-type channel inactivation but did not restore orthograde signaling. Another conclusion of this study is that the 1393–1527 region of the L-type calcium channels α1subunit can bind Ca2+, Ca2+ calmodulin, and apocalmodulin. The IQ motif is missing in the D1393–1527 protein, confirming that the IQ motif is not the only determinant of CaM binding in the carboxyl tail of the DHPR. In skeletal muscle only every other RYR1 is coupled to a tetrad of L-type channels (24Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). One possible explanation of our findings is that CaM plays very different roles in mechanically coupled channels compared with those that are not coupled (Fig. 3C). Calmodulin increases the sensitivity of both channel activation and closing to Ca2+ (16Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 18Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B.Y. Zhang J.Z. Krol J. Pedersen S.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and this is likely to occur with the uncoupled channels. CaM could regulate Ca2+-dependent inactivation and/or facilitation in the uncoupled skeletal L-type channels, similar to that described with the cardiac L-type channels. However, the majority of the L-type channels are likely to be coupled in skeletal muscle. The binding of CaM to the uncoupled RYRs (half the population of RYRs (25Franzini-Armstrong C. Kish J.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) would enhance their Ca2+ sensitivity, consistent with the hypothesis that these channels are normally activated by Ca2+ released from the SR. Uncoupled RYR1s may play a role in the spreading of the Ca2+ signal. Coupled gating of RYRs (26Marx S.O. Ondrias K. Marks A.R. Science. 1998; 281: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) may also serve to regulate the opening of those channels that are not physically coupled to DHPRs, and calmodulin may in some way regulate the Ca2+ sensitivity of the cooperative opening. Coupled channels, however, may not ever bind calmodulin. The high effective local concentrations of the two ion channels arising from their immobilization in the triad could allow the interactions between the carboxyl terminus of the DHPR and the CaM binding domain of RYR1 to effectively prevent CaM binding to both proteins. A second possibility is that calmodulin at a sufficiently high concentration could competitively inhibit the interactions between these proteins at this site of interaction. The functional consequences of such an effect remain to be determined. Calmodulin binding sites on both RYR1 and the DHPR are highly conserved between the cardiac and the skeletal muscle isoforms. A surprising conclusion of our study is that proteins may be able to utilize CaM binding motifs to bind proteins other than CaM. The ability of a sequence to play an entirely different functional role depending on its environment would suggest that such sequences might be more accurately described as protein-protein interaction motifs rather than the more contextually specific calmodulin binding sites. This study, therefore, not only identifies new candidate regions to participate in mechanical excitation-contraction coupling but also defines a new type of protein-interaction motif."

In pursuit of the mechanism involved in this transformation, we asked whether MMP inhibitors modulate contact inhibition and cell adhesion, because the dysregulation of these events is essential for cellular transformation. Using both genetic and biochemical means, we demonstrate that MMP inhibitors regulate fibroblast cell adhesion. TIMP-1 down-regulated cells formed dense, multilayered colonies, suggesting a loss of contact inhibition.

Consequently, the effect of MMPi on both cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-cell adhesion were investigated. Upon MMPi treatment, p125FAK was redistributed, together with vinculin, to points of cell-ECM contact. Furthermore, phosphorylation of p125FAK was restored to levels similar to that of wild type. In parallel, MMPi treatment increased cadherin levels and stabilized cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. Moreover, enhanced cadherin function was evident as increased calcium-dependent cell-cell aggregation and co-localization of cadherin and β-catenin at the cell membrane. We also obtained independent evidence of altered cadherin function usingtimp-1 −/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

Our understanding of the role of this proteolytic system in cancer has evolved over the past decade. Initially linked to tumor invasion and metastasis, an MMP:TIMP imbalance is now thought to function in promoting early events of tumor development (1Chambers A.F. Matrisian L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). The current emphasis is on identifying the mechanisms underlying these early effects. A better understanding of the relationship between MMP:TIMP activity and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-cell communication is fundamental to this effort.We had reported that down-regulation of TIMP-1 expression caused an immortal fibroblast cell line to become tumorigenic (2Khokha R. Waterhouse P. Yagel S. Lala P.K. Overall C.M. Norton G. Denhardt D.T. Science. 1989; 243: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Extensive literature has since led to the knowledge that cancer involves a disrupted balance between MMPs and TIMPs. Both TIMPs and MMPs have been manipulated through genetic and biochemical approaches in tissue culture systems to demonstrate that, in general, TIMPs inhibit tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumor formation (3Albini A.

A. 1997; 94: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In addition to the classic MMP substrates (the structural ECM proteins), soluble and cell surface proteins have been recognized as novel MMP substrates. These include growth factor binding proteins (20Fowlkes J.L. Thrailkill K.M. Serra D.M. Nagase H. Endocrine. 1997; 7: 33-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), growth factor receptors (21Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar), and cell adhesion proteins (22Lochter A. Galosy S. Muschler J. Freedman N. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). These molecules are involved in cell signaling and thus expand the possible roles of pericellular proteolysis in early events of tumorigenesis.Non-transformed cells exhibit reduced proliferation at high density, and this phenomenon has been termed contact inhibition (23Wieser R.J. Oesch F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Wieser R.J. Renauer D. Schafer A. Heck R. Engel R. Schutz S. Oesch F. Environ. Health Perspect. 1990; 88: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Loss of contact inhibition is one of the early events associated with cellular transformation and cancer. Physical contacts that include both cell-ECM and cell-cell adhesion are known to influence cell fate through apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation (25Ruoslahti E. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Watton S.J. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 433-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The cell interacts with ECM through an establishment of focal adhesion contacts, typically composed of integrins and various cytoplasmic proteins that link the cytoskeleton to the ECM (27Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Cell-cell interactions, on the other hand, primarily involve cadherins (28Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The function of integrin and cadherin in cell contact and adhesion has been extensively studied, whereas the role of pericellular proteolysis in influencing physical contact has just begun to unfold.One potential mechanism by which pericellular proteolysis may influence physical contact is through the modification of integrins and cadherins. Integrins are the primary cell surface receptors for ECM molecules, and the latter are the principal substrates for MMPs. Therefore, MMP degradation of ECM molecules can indirectly affect integrin mediated focal contacts. Although direct associations of specific MMPs and cell adhesion molecules such as integrins have been reported (29Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar, 30Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), MMP-mediated cleavage of these proteins is not known to occur. In contrast to integrins, MMPs have been suggested to target cadherin cleavage. For example, overexpression of stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) leads to the release of E-cadherin ectodomain in mammary epithelial cells, whereas a synthetic MMP inhibitor or transgenic TIMP-1 inhibits this event (22Lochter A. Galosy S. Muschler J. Freedman N. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 31Lochter A. Srebrow A. Sympson C.J. Terracio N. Werb Z.

Bissell M.J. Werb Z. Cell. 1999; 98: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Similarly, MMPi has been reported to reduce VE-cadherin shedding in endothelial cells (33Herren B. Levkau B. Raines E.W. Ross R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that MMP proteolysis may process cell adhesion molecules to modify cell-cell adhesion and consequently affect cell fate.The purpose of this study was to determine whether lack of cellular contacts underlies the acquisition of tumorigenic potential of TIMP-1 down-regulated fibroblasts. Our investigation of the effects of MMP inhibitors on cell interactions with the matrix and adjacent cells revealed substantial effects on both adhesion systems. In TIMP-1-modulated fibroblast cell lines, we observed a relationship between TIMP-1 and cell density that suggested decreased TIMP-1 reduces contact inhibition. A biochemical approach using recombinant and synthetic MMP inhibitors showed that MMP inhibitors restored cell-ECM and cell-cell contacts. Moreover, laser scanning confocal microscopy identified that this rescue was due to an up-regulation of focal adhesion contacts and cadherin localization at cell-cell contacts. Subsequently, the molecules downstream of these key adhesion proteins were functionally altered, including increased FAK activation and facilitation of β-catenin localization to the cell membrane. We propose that the MMP:TIMP proteolytic axis may impact tumorigenesis through dysregulation of cell adhesion systems.DISCUSSIONHere we demonstrate that the MMP:TIMP proteolytic axis regulates cell adhesion systems and has an important influence on cell characteristics that are linked to cell transformation and tumorigenesis. Tumor cells lack contact inhibition (46Raz A. CIBA Found. Symp. 1988; 141: 109-122PubMed Google Scholar), typically observed as anchorage-independent growth and continued proliferation in confluent cultures. Effects of MMP inhibitors on cell adhesion were explored using TIMP-1 down-regulated cells, which displayed higher saturation density, growth in soft agar, and tumorigenic and metastatic potential (2Khokha R. Waterhouse P. Yagel S. Lala P.K. Overall C.M. Norton G. Denhardt D.T. Science. 1989; 243: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 34Khokha R. Waterhouse P. Lala P. Zimmer M. Denhardt D.T. Khokka R. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1991; 117: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36Denhardt D.T. Khokha R. Yagel S. Overall C.M. Parhar R.S. Birkedal-Hansen H. Werb Z. Welgus H. Van Wart H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and Inhibitors. Gustav Fischer Verlag, New York1992: 281-285Google Scholar). Physiological and synthetic MMP inhibitors altered cell morphology and cell contact and restored cell density in a dose-dependent manner, thus re-establishing the adhesion characteristics of non-transformed cells. We tracked the effects of MMPi on cell-ECM adhesion through analysis of focal contacts, and on cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Even though p125FAKprotein levels were unaffected, increased co-localization of vinculin and p125FAK were apparent in focal contacts. Subsequently, the phosphorylation of p125FAK was substantially increased in LA1 cells upon MMPi treatment. In parallel, MMPi treatment also affected cell-cell adhesion. Cadherin protein levels and localization at cell-cell contacts were increased. We further demonstrated enhanced cadherin function as increased calcium dependent cell-cell aggregation, association of β-catenin with cadherins, and β-catenin localization at the cell membrane. Moreover, independent evidence of altered cadherin function was obtained using timp-1 −/−MEFs.We propose (Fig. 6) that MMP inhibitors augment cell adhesion by two methods: first, by preventing cadherin ectodomain cleavage and thus stabilizing cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts, and their association with the actin cytoskeleton through β-catenin (44Barth A.I. Nathke I.S. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 45Knudsen K.A. Frankowski C. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1998; 31: 168-176Crossref Google Scholar); second, by inhibiting ECM degradation and thereby maintaining integrin-ECM adhesion, focal contact assembly, and activation of p125FAK via its phosphorylation. Moreover, there is increasing evidence for cross-talk between integrins and cadherins, suggesting that they functionally co-operate during cell adhesion, migration, and developmental processes. For example, the restoration of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion diminishes the motility of ras-transformed MDCK-f3 epithelial cells through ECM-activated rac signaling (47Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Also, cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts act together to revert the compact phenotype of the colorectal carcinoma cell line VACO to normal epithelial morphology (48Cowell H.E. Garrod D.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, signaling molecules are shared between N-cadherin and β1-integrins during neurite migration (49Arregui C. Pathre P. Lilien J. Balsamo J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1263-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 50Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar). Overall, the stabilizing influence of MMP inhibitors on cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts would allow optimal integration of the microenvironmental information.Following MMPi treatment, we observed enhanced cadherin/β-catenin co-localization at cell-cell contacts by laser scanning confocal microscopy, as well as an enhanced physical association between cadherin/β-catenin proteins by co-immunoprecipitation. The reduced associations between cadherin/β-catenin in TIMP-1 down-regulated cells may provide a trigger for tumorigenic potential. This idea stems from literature documenting the involvement of the cadherin/β-catenin pathway in many aspects of tumorigenesis (44Barth A.I. Nathke I.S. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 51Li H. Leung T.C. Hoffman S. Balsamo J. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1275-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 52Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that a disruption of adhesion systems can initiate neoplastic transformation and contribute a rate-limiting step to progression (53Tlsty T.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, several studies show that the down-regulation of cadherins enhance tumor development, increased cadherins reduce tumorigenic properties (54Frixen U.H. Behrens J. Sachs M. Eberle G. Voss B. Warda A. Lochner D. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar, 55Perl A.K. Wilgenbus P. Dahl U. Semb H. Christofori G. Nature. 1998; 392: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 56Vleminckx K. Vakaet Jr, L. Mareel M. Fiers W. van Roy F. Cell. 1991; 66: 107-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar), and a lack of stable E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact has even been proposed to initiate genomic instability (53Tlsty T.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One reason for the central role of cadherins in tumorigenesis is their ability to bind β-catenin. The latter is a shared target of cadherins and the Wnt signal transduction pathway. Specifically, E-cadherin and LEF-1 that is involved in Wnt signaling form mutually exclusive complexes with β-catenin, and therefore E-cadherin binding prevents β-catenin nuclear localization and transactivation of transcription (57Orsulic S. Huber O. Aberle H. Arnold S. Kemler R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A modest overexpression of β-catenin has been reported to promote cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, protect cells from anoikis, and lead to cellular transformation (37Orford K. Orford C.C. Byers S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, β-catenin signaling through the Wnt pathway may be one mechanistic link between MMP-proteolysis and cell adhesion, contact inhibition, and tumorigenesis.Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts are known to produce ECM components, mainly collagen type I (58Goldberg B. Cell. 1977; 11: 169-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Under adhesive conditions, similar to our studies, collagen production was shown to be independent of the growth state of these fibroblasts (59Dhawan J. Farmer S.R. J. Biol.

ECM components and architectureper se are involved in integrin clustering and integrin-mediated signal transduction through tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK (60Honore S. Pichard V. Penel C.

Thus, it is conceivable that MMPi treatment inhibited the degradation of integrin ligands and promoted the assembly of focal contacts that was observed as altered subcellular distribution of p125FAK and vinculin at cell-ECM contact and p125FAK phosphorylation. Alternatively, it is possible that MMP action modulated the three-dimensional collagen structure that subsequently altered p125FAK phosphorylation, such as that shown by Lauer et al. (61Lauer J.L. Gendron C.M. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Although secreted/transmembrane MMPs are proximal to cell adhesion molecules, the impact of proteolysis on multiple adhesion systems and their downstream effectors remains far from understood. In parallel, we examined the influence of MMPi on both cell-ECM and cell-cell contact. A unique observation is that, despite the lack of an effect on the p125FAK protein levels, its phosphorylation status is restored to that of wild type fibroblasts upon MMPi treatment. Although the effects of MMPi on p125FAK activity have never been reported, our findings on MMPi modulation of cadherins are consistent with the other studies that have utilized epithelial or endothelial cells. Overexpression of stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) in mammary epithelial cells altered cell morphology and reduced E-cadherin and β-catenin from cell membrane, which was inhibited by MMPi (22Lochter A. Galosy S. Muschler J. Freedman N. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). These events were proposed to promote cell invasion and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Similarly, shedding of VE cadherin from endothelial cells was blocked by MMPi treatment during apoptosis (33Herren B. Levkau B. Raines E.W. Ross R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition to altering cadherin levels in our fibroblasts, we provide novel evidence that MMPi treatment recruits β-catenin to the cell-cell contacts and functionally enhances the calcium-dependent cell adhesion in tumorigenic fibroblasts. Taken together, MMP-based proteolysis of cell adhesion molecules and their downstream pathways may be a universal mechanism for influencing cell fate of various lineages including epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblasts.It is possible that a feedback loop exists between the TIMP:MMP and cadherin/β-catenin systems, where increased proteolysis would enhance β-catenin activity, which in turn would induce MMP production. In support of this idea, it has been shown that one of the identified targets of β-catenin/LEF-1 transactivation is MMP-7 (63Brabletz T. Jung A. Dag S. Hlubek F. Kirchner T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1033-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 64Crawford H.C. Fingleton B.M. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Goss K.J. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Matrisian L.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2883-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that E-cadherin-transfected prostatic adenocarcinoma cells have reduced MMP-2 activity and display a reversion of an invasive to a stationary phenotype (65Luo J. Lubaroff D.M. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3552-3556PubMed Google Scholar), whereas E-cadherin down-regulation results in increased MMP-9 activity, motility, and metastasis of skin carcinomas cells (66Llorens A. Rodrigo I. Lopez-Barcons L. Gonzalez-Garrigues M. Lozano E. Vinyals A. Quintanilla M. Cano A. Fabra A. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1131-1142PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, TIMP-1 down-regulated cells, which also have reduced cadherin levels, form tumors in which MMP-3 mRNA is consistently expressed (34Khokha R. Waterhouse P. Lala P. Zimmer M. Denhardt D.T. Khokka R. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1991; 117: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This particular MMP has been suggested to provide a “master regulatory switch” for mammary epithelial tumorigenesis (32Sternlicht M.D. Lochter A. Sympson C.J. Huey B. Rougier J.P. Gray J.W. Pinkel D. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. Cell. 1999; 98: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that an integration of proteolytic and adhesion systems is required for optimal cell interaction and function. Once this stable link is breached, a molecular and functional cascade then initiates events conducive to tumorigenesis.Cadherins and β-catenin have primarily been studied in epithelial cells. At present, the role of cadherins/β-catenin in fibroblasts remains poorly understood. Intriguingly, a recent study showed that mutations in β-catenin occurred with the highest frequency in aggressive infiltrative fibromatosis (67Couture J. Mitri A. Lagace R. Smits R. Berk T. Bouchard H.L. Fodde R. Alman B. Bapat B. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which are considered to be the most common cause of mortality in familial adenomatous polyposis patients (68Tejpar S. Nollet F. Li C. Wunder J.S. Michils G. dal Cin P. Van Cutsem E. Bapat B. van Roy F. Cassiman J.J. Alman B.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6615-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that cadherin/β-catenin dysfunction underlies fibroblast tumorigenesis. Our current investigations focused on tumorigenic fibroblasts, and we were able to manipulate the cellular distribution and association of cadherin/β-catenin with MMPi. MMPi may additionally contribute to creating a non-permissive environment for tumor growth, because stromal contribution of MMPs is known to promote tumor progression (69Masson R. Lefebvre O. Noel A. Fahime M.E. Chenard M.P. Wendling C. Kebers F. LeMeur M. Dierich A. Foidart J.M. Basset P. Rio M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).We demonstrate that biological and synthetic MMP inhibitors promote the assembly and the stabilization of both focal and cell-cell contacts. Because p125FAK and cadherin function were restored by MMPi treatment in TIMP-1 down-regulated cells, our data provide compelling evidence for a relationship between pericellular proteolysis and activity of the key signaling molecules downstream of cell adhesion. Our data support the emerging concept that an integration of proteolysis and adhesion influence cell fate and tumorigenesis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) constitute a key system of pericellular proteolysis within the cell microenvironment. Our understanding of the role of this proteolytic system in cancer has evolved over the past decade. Initially linked to tumor invasion and metastasis, an MMP:TIMP imbalance is now thought to function in promoting early events of tumor development (1Chambers A.F. Matrisian L.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). The current emphasis is on identifying the mechanisms underlying these early effects. A better understanding of the relationship between MMP:TIMP activity and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-cell communication is fundamental to this effort. We had reported that down-regulation of TIMP-1 expression caused an immortal fibroblast cell line to become tumorigenic (2Khokha R. Waterhouse P. Yagel S. Lala P.K. Overall C.M. Norton G. Denhardt D.T. Science. 1989; 243: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Extensive literature has since led to the knowledge that cancer involves a disrupted balance between MMPs and TIMPs. Both TIMPs and MMPs have been manipulated through genetic and biochemical approaches in tissue culture systems to demonstrate that, in general, TIMPs inhibit tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumor formation (3Albini A.

https://openalex.org/W2072770020,"The serum response element (SRE) of the c-fos promoter is a convergence point for mitogenic signaling pathways. Several transcription factors regulate SRE, including serum response factor (SRF), ternary complex factors, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBPβ). C/EBPβ can interact with both SRF and the ternary complex factor family member Elk-1, but only in response to activated Ras. Transactivation of the SRE by C/EBPβ is also greatly stimulated by Ras. The Ras effectors that signal to C/EBPβ are unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that a consensus MAPK site in C/EBPβ is necessary for Ras stimulation of both C/EBPβ-SRF interaction and transactivation of the SRE by C/EBPβ. To dissect signaling pathways activated downstream of Ras, different Ras effector constructs were analyzed. We show that activated forms of Raf and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase stimulate C/EBPβ-SRF interaction. We also show a novel selectivity for the MAPK family member ERK2, where dominant-negative ERK2, but not dominant-negative ERK1, blocks Ras stimulation of C/EBPβ-SRF interaction. In addition, recombinant C/EBPβ protein is phosphorylated by ERK2, but not by ERK1, in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate a requirement for p90Rsk2 in regulation of C/EBPβ-SRF interaction. These data show that multiple Ras effectors are required to regulate C/EBPβ and SRF association.

Curran T. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1989; 1: 65-88PubMed Google Scholar). The serum response element (SRE)1 in the c-fos promoter is a convergence point for several signaling pathways that regulate induction of the c-fos gene (reviewed in Ref. 2Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The SRE is located ∼300 base pairs (bp) upstream of the transcriptional start site and is necessary for serum induction of c-fos (3Treisman R. Cell. 1986; 46: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Serum response factor (SRF) is a 67-kDa protein that was found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for serum induction of the SRE (4Treisman R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2711-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 5Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). SRF is constitutively bound to the SRE in both the absence and presence of mitogenic stimulation, as demonstrated byin vivo footprinting analysis (6Herrera R.E. Shaw P.E. Nordheim A. Nature. 1989; 340: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This suggests that it is a transcriptional complex of SRF and its accessory proteins that is regulated rather than regulation of SRF DNA binding. Both Ras- and Rho-dependent signaling pathways have been shown to regulate the SRE. Ras is a member of the family of small GTPases and is a key mediator of intracellular signaling cascades (reviewed in Ref. 7Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d887-d912Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), including the Raf and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. The Raf pathway activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), ERK1 and ERK2 (reviewed in Ref. 8English J. Pearson G. Wilsbacher J. Swantek J. Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). These two ERK isoforms are thought to have overlapping substratesin vivo and in vitro. There are some reports, however, suggesting that ERK1 and ERK2 may have distinct substratesin vivo. For example, the ERK1 knockout mouse has a defect in thymocyte maturation, even though ERK2 is expressed in the mutant thymocytes (9Pages G. Guerin S. Grall D. Bonino F. Smith A. Anjuere F. Auberger P. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1999; 286: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). This would suggest that ERK1 and ERK2 are not completely redundant in vivo. PI3K effectors include PI3K-dependent kinase, protein kinase B, Rac, Cdc42, p70S6K, and p90Rsk2. p90Rsk2 is an interesting effector of PI3K because there is evidence that full activation requires phosphorylation by PI3K-dependent kinase-1 as well as the ERKs (reviewed in Ref. 10Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ras-activated signaling cascades do not function in completely linear pathways. Extensively studied targets of the Ras pathway at the SRE are the ternary complex factors (TCFs). The TCFs are members of the Ets family of transcription factors and have a role in regulating the SRE in concert with SRF (reviewed in Ref. 11Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The TCFs are inactive in the absence of mitogenic signaling, but are activated by phosphorylation of consensus mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) sites in their C-terminal transactivation domains. This phosphorylation is accomplished by all three MAPK families: the ERKs, the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs)/stress-activated protein kinases, and p38 kinase (12Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 13Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 14Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Rho-dependent signaling pathways have also been shown to regulate the SRE independently of the TCFs. This pathway involves the Rho family members RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (15Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway is dependent on SRF binding to DNA through its own DNA-binding domain (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5421-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that this pathway is targeting an unknown accessory factor of SRF (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5421-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBPβ) is another transcription factor that has a role in regulating the c-fos SRE (18Metz R. Ziff E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 19Sealy L. Malone D. Pawlak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1744-1755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously shown that the activator isoform of C/EBPβ, p35-C/EBPβ (also known as liver-enriched activator protein (LAP)), activates an SRE-driven reporter construct, whereas the repressor isoform, p20-C/EBPβ (also known as liver-enriched inhibitory protein), represses serum stimulation of this reporter (19Sealy L. Malone D. Pawlak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1744-1755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that p35-C/EBPβ can interact with SRF and the TCF family member Elk-1 in vivo, but these interactions are dependent on the presence of activated Ras (20Hanlon M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14224-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Hanlon M. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. BMC Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is unknown, however, which signaling pathways act downstream of Ras to stimulate p35-C/EBPβ interaction with transcription factors at the SRE. This report has analyzed the signaling pathways that are activated in response to Ras to stimulate the interaction of p35-C/EBPβ with SRF and subsequently stimulate transactivation of the SRE. We show that a consensus MAPK site in C/EBPβ is necessary for Ras-stimulated C/EBPβ-SRF interaction as well as C/EBPβ transactivation of the SRE. Furthermore, we show that activated forms of Raf and PI3K can stimulate the C/EBPβ-SRF interaction. We also demonstrate that dominant-negative ERK2, but not ERK1, inhibits Ras stimulation of the C/EBPβ-SRF interaction. Recombinant C/EBPβ is also selectively phosphorylated in vitro by ERK2, but not by ERK1. We also show a requirement for p90Rsk2 in regulating the C/EBPβ-SRF interaction. We did not find a role for the Rho family of small GTPases in stimulation of the C/EBPβ-SRF interaction. These data strongly suggest that multiple Ras effectors are regulating C/EBPβ and SRF to stimulate their interaction, resulting in enhanced transactivation of the SRE. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (from American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum (Colorado Serum Co.), 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, 25 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 25 mg/ml streptomycin. NIH 3T3 transfections were performed using NovaFector (Venn Nova) or Trans-IT LT1 (PanVera) as described previously (21Hanlon M. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. BMC Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cell extracts of equivalent protein concentration were prepared and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter activity as previously described (22Mobley C.M. Sealy L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6592-6601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For drug-treated samples, SB 202190 (10 µm; Calbiochem) was added to the cells for 8 h prior to harvesting. An internal control plasmid to measure transfection efficiency could not be used because C/EBPβ alters transcription of the control plasmid, thereby making the internal control invalid. The transfections were repeated multiple times to control for variability in transfection efficiency. In addition, different stocks of DNA were used for the transfections to control for the variability in transfection efficiency between DNA preparations. The pGAL4 and pG5CAT plasmids were obtained from the mammalian MATCHMAKER two-hybrid assay kit (CLONTECH). The following were constructed as previously described: pGAL4-SRF (20Hanlon M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14224-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), TCFmut-CAT (19Sealy L. Malone D. Pawlak M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1744-1755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pRSETA-p35-C/EBPβ was constructed by digesting pRSETB-p42-C/EBPβ (23Sears R.C. Sealy L. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4855-4871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pRSETA-p35-C/EBPβ. pcDNA3-p35-C/EBPβ(P189G) was constructed in a multistep protocol. First, pRSETA-p35-C/EBPβ was cut with SmaI to release a 416-bp fragment. This fragment was inserted into a similarly digested pUC19 vector (this construct is now called pUC19-C/EBPβ(Sma)). This vector was then digested with EcoRI and NaeI to release a 72-bp fragment. The following oligonucleotides (Sigma) were used to replace the wild-type sequence (restriction enzyme sites are in lowercase; mutant sequences are underlined): top strand, 5′-aattcTCGAGCCCGGGACGGGGAGCCCCGCCGACGCCAAGGCCGCGCCCGCCGCCTGCTTCGCGGGGCCgcc-3′; and bottom strand, 5′-ggc- GGCCCCGCGAAGCAGGCGGCGGGCGCGGCCTTGGCGTCGGCGG- GGCTCCCCGTCCCGGGCTCGAg-3′. The oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted into theEcoRI/NaeI-digested vector. pUC19-C/EBPβ(Sma), now containing the mutation, was digested with SmaI to release a 416-bp fragment. This fragment was inserted into similarly digested pRSETA-p35-C/EBPβ. This generated the pRSETA-p35-C/EBPβ(P189G) mutant. To generate pcDNA3-p35-C/EBPβ(P189G), pRSETA-p35-C/EBPβ(P189G) was digested with BamHI and EcoRV to release a 916-bp fragment. This fragment was inserted into similarly digested pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pGAL4-SRFm103 was generated in a two-step protocol. First, pTL2/SRFm103 (a gift of M. Greenberg, Harvard Medical School) (28Rivera V.M. Miranti C.K. Misra R.P. Ginty D.D. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell.

The fragment was inserted into similarly digested pcDNA3 to create pcDNA3-SRFm103. Second, pcDNA3-SRFm103 was digested with EcoRI to release a 1.6-kilobase pair fragment.

Histidine-tagged C/EBPβ protein was produced in Escherichia coli by 80 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction overnight at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8), 300 mm NaCl, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors (1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride, and 0.1 µm pepstatin)). Bacteria were lysed by lysozyme incubation, followed by three rounds of sonication at setting 2 and 30% duty. After clarification by centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in equilibration buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride in 25 mm MES (pH 8) and protease/phosphatase inhibitors). The preparation was again clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography column (QIAGEN Inc.). The column was treated as described by the manufacturer for denaturing conditions. The protein was eluted from the column with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in 25 mm MES (pH 8), 100 mm EDTA, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors. The protein was dialyzed to remove guanidine hydrochloride, with final dialysis in a solution containing 25 mm MES (pH 8), 5% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Recombinant histidine-tagged p35-C/EBPβ or myelin basic protein (MBP; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was incubated with activated ERK1 (50 milliunits; Alexis Biochemicals) or ERK2 (20 milliunits; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in the presence of 80 µm ATP, 13 mm MgCl2, and 15 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were carried out in a shaking 30 °C incubator for 10 min. SDS sample buffer was added to the MBP kinase reaction and boiled for 5 min. For the p35-C/EBPβ reactions, the tagged protein was immunoprecipitated with T7 tag antibody-agarose beads (Novagen). Briefly, the beads were mixed with 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), and protease/phosphatase inhibitors). The kinase reaction was added to the beads, and the beads were incubated with the protein for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed once with immunoprecipitation buffer before adding SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were analyzed on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel, and phosphate incorporation was detected by autoradiography. Whole cell extracts from NIH 3T3 cells containing equivalent protein concentration were analyzed by electrophoresis on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was equilibrated in transfer buffer (33 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol) for 15 min before transfer of proteins to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). After transfer, immunoblotting was performed as described previously (19Sealy L. Malone D. Pawlak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1744-1755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except a 1:4000 dilution of anti-SRF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a 1:8000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used. The secondary antibody was detected using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Thr235 (numbering for the human protein) of C/EBPβ, located in a consensus MAPK phosphorylation sequence, has been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo by activated Ras and also to be phosphorylated by an MAPK preparation in vitro (30Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of Thr235 to alanine inhibits Ras stimulation of the C/EBPβ-SRF interaction in the mammalian two-hybrid assay (20Hanlon M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14224-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To confirm that a proline-directed kinase is necessary for mediating Ras stimulation, we mutated Pro189 (numbering for the rat protein) in the MAPK site (PGT188P189) to glycine. If a proline-directed MAPK was targeting C/EBPβ at this site, we hypothesized that this mutant would not be able to be phosphorylated and therefore be unresponsive to Ras. This hypothesis was tested in the mammalian two-hybrid assay. The mammalian two-hybrid assay utilizes a CAT reporter gene upstream of five copies of the Gal4 DNA-binding site driven by the E1B minimal promoter (pG5CAT). A Gal4-SRF fusion protein has been previously described (20Hanlon M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14224-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SRF is therefore brought to the DNA by binding to the Gal4 sites. As shown in Fig. 1, when the reporter construct alone or the reporter and Gal4-SRF were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells, there was no increase in CAT activity in the presence or absence of an activated Ras construct (CMV-Ras.V12). SRF has a weak transactivation domain, as has been shown before (31Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), so no increase in transcription in the presence of SRF was observed. When an expression construct encoding wild-type p35-C/EBPβ (CMV-LAP) was cotransfected with Gal4-SRF and the reporter into NIH 3T3 cells in the presence of an activated Ras construct, there was a large increase in CAT activity, with an average increase of 70-fold over basal levels. We previously showed that the transactivation domain of p35-C/EBPβ is not stimulated by Ras in this assay (20Hanlon M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14224-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the stimulation by Ras reflects stimulation of the interaction between SRF and p35-C/EPBβ. When an expression construct encoding the p35-C/EBPβ(P189G) mutant was transfected with SRF and the reporter construct, there was a 2-fold increase in CAT activity in the absence of Ras and only a 5-fold increase when Ras was cotransfected (Fig. 1). Therefore, the C/EBPβ protein that contains a mutation in the MAPK site was no longer responsive to Ras in this assay, and Ras did not stimulate the interaction of the mutant with SRF. The p35-C/EBPβ(P189G) protein was expressed in vivo as detected by Western blotting, and it also bound the SRE in vitro in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to the same extent as the wild-type protein (data not shown). Therefore, the mutation does not appear to affect protein stability or destroy the ability of the protein to fold correctly as evidenced by DNA binding. We reason that the mutant was unable to respond to Ras in this assay due to the inability of the protein to be phosphorylated by the MAPKs. Due to the fact that mutation of the MAPK site in C/EBPβ abolishes Ras stimulation of its interaction with SRF, we extended our studies to determine if the MAPK site was also necessary for transactivation of the SRE by C/EBPβ in response to Ras. To address this question, we used a CAT reporter gene driven by one copy of a TCF mutant SRE upstream of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat minimal promoter (19Sealy L. Malone D. Pawlak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1744-1755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This reporter is unable to bind the TCF family members, which are known targets of Ras. Therefore, this oblates any effect of Ras that could be signaling through the TCF family members. As shown in Fig. 2, when the TCFmut-CAT reporter construct was transfected together with an expression construct for human C/EBPβ (NFIL6), there was a 7-fold increase in CAT activity in the absence of Ras. When activated Ras was also cotransfected, this stimulated the CAT activity to 19-fold. This was expected since Ras greatly stimulates the interaction between SRF and C/EBPβ, which would result in enhanced transactivation. Interestingly, the transactivation of a mutant C/EBPβ construct containing a mutation of Thr235 in the MAPK site to alanine (NFIL6(T235A)) was not stimulated by Ras. Therefore, mutating the MAPK phosphorylation site in C/EBPβ abolished the ability of Ras to stimulate transactivation. These data also agree with a previous study showing that Ras does not stimulate the interaction of the NFIL6(T235A) mutant with SRF in the mammalian two-hybrid assay (20Hanlon M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14224-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Together, these data demonstrate that C/EBPβ Thr235 is required in mediating Ras stimulation of the C/EBPβ interaction with SRF and transactivation of the SRE. We next wanted to analyze the signaling pathways that are downstream of activated Ras in stimulating the interaction between C/EBPβ and SRF. Ras has many known effectors, but the above data suggest that Ras is stimulating an MAPK pathway to target C/EBPβ. We tested several Ras effectors to determine if they could regulate the C/EBPβ-SRF interaction in the mammalian two-hybrid assay. Fig. 3A shows that when p35-C/EBPβ was cotransfected with Gal4-SRF and the pG5CAT reporter construct into NIH 3T3 cells in the presence of an activated Ras construct, there was a large increase in CAT activity that was normalized to 100%. As also shown in Fig. 3A, activated constructs of Raf (Raf-CAAX) and PI3K (p110-CAAX), two known Ras effectors, stimulated the interaction of the two proteins. Raf was a stronger activator, stimulating to ∼70% the level of Ras. PI3K also stimulated the interaction of the proteins, to ∼35% of the level observed with Ras. There was no significant increase in CAT activity of the reporter alone or the reporter and Gal4-SRF in the presence of activated Raf or PI3K. In the presence of both PI3K and Raf, there was an additive effect on the stimulation over adding either effector alone. This suggests that the Raf and PI3K effectors are activating distinct pathways to stimulate the interaction between SRF and C/EBPβ. Members of the Rho family of small GTPases are downstream of PI3K, and the SRE is a target of RhoA-, Cdc42-, and Rac1-dependent signaling cascades (15Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Stimulation of SRE transactivation by the Rho family has been shown to be SRF-dependent, possibly targeting an unknown accessory factor (15Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5421-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We next tested members of the Rho family to determine if they regulated the interaction between SRF and p35-C/EBPβ in the two-hybrid assay (Fig.3B). Activated forms of RhoA (RhoA.V14), Cdc42 (Cdc42.V12), and Rac1 (Rac1(QL)) had no stimulatory effect on the p35-C/EBPβ-SRF interaction. Likewise, dominant-negative Rac1 (Rac1.N17) did not inhibit Ras stimulation. Rho family signaling to the SRE has been shown to be independent of the TCFs (15Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). These data show that p35-C/EBPβ is also not a target of the TCF-independent Rho pathway. Because the Ras signaling pathway appears to be working through an MAPK cascade, we tested whether inhibition of the MAPKs would inhibit Ras stimulation of the C/EBPβ-SRF interaction. To address this question, the mammalian two-hybrid assay was again used. As shown in Fig. 4, cotransfection of p35-C/EBPβ, Gal4-SRF, and the Gal4 reporter construct resulted in an average 3-fold increase in CAT activity in the absence of Ras, and Ras stimulated the C/EBPβ-SRF interaction to 95-fold over basal levels. To determine if the MAPKs play a role in this Ras stimulation, we utilized an MKP-1 construct that can inactivate all three families of MAPKs (25Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). We tested this construct's ability to inhibit Ras stimulation of the interaction between SRF and p35-C/EBPβ. When MKP-1 was transfected with Gal4-SRF, p35-C/EBPβ, and activated Ras, MKP-1 blocked Ras stimulation from 95- to 18-fold (Fig. 4). These data show that inactivation of the MAPK family members inhibits Ras stimulation of the p35-C/EBPβ-SRF interaction and suggest that MAPKs are working downstream of Ras to target C/EBPβ. Since MKP-1 inhibits all three MAPK family members, the next step in our analysis was to inhibit specific MAPKs to determine what effect this would have on the interaction between SRF and p35-C/EBPβ. We therefore tested the requirement for the three MAPK family members in stimulation of the p35-C/EBPβ-SRF interaction by Ras. We first tested the importance of the ERK family members by utilizing dominant-negative ERK1 and ERK2 constructs in the two-hybrid assay. When the pG5CAT reporter was transfected with Gal4-SRF and p35-C/EBPβ into NIH 3T3 cells, there was a large stimulation in CAT activity in the presence of activated Ras to 47-fold over basal levels (Fig.5A). When an expression vector encoding a kinase-inactive and dominant-negative (DN) ERK1 (32Frost J.A. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3844-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was cotransfected with the above constructs, there was no significant inhibition by the DN ERK1 construct. Therefore, we did not observe an inhibition by DN ERK1, as we observed with MKP-1 shown above (Fig. 4). Interestingly, when DN ERK2 (32Frost J.A. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3844-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was cotransfected with Gal4-SRF, p35-C/EBPβ, and Ras, there was a large inhibition of CAT activity, which decreased from 47- to 11-fold.

This hypothesis was investigated by analyzing the effects of tyrosine phosphorylation of villin on the kinetics of actin polymerization by reconstituting in vitrothe tyrosine phosphorylation of villin and its association with actin. Full-length recombinant human villin was phosphorylated in vitro by expression in the TKX1-competent cells that carry an inducible tyrosine kinase gene. The actin-binding properties of villin were examined using a co-sedimentation assay. Phosphorylation of villin did not change the stoichiometry (1:2) but decreased the binding affinity (4.4 μm for unphosphorylatedversus 0.6 μm for phosphorylated) of villin for actin. Using a pyrene-actin-based fluorescence assay, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation had a negative effect on actin nucleation by villin. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation enhanced actin severing by villin. Electron microscopic analysis showed complementary morphological changes. Phosphorylation inhibited the actin bundling and enhanced the actin severing functions of villin. Taken together our data show that tyrosine phosphorylation of villin decreases the amount of villin bound to actin filaments, inhibits the actin-polymerizing properties of villin, and promotes the actin-depolymerizing functions instead.

Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation may also be a common feature of this family of proteins, and phosphorylation may play an important role in the organization of the actin network by these actin-binding proteins.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of villin and its ligand binding properties suggest that in addition to its role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, villin may also be a regulatory target. Thus, villin may function as a structural scaffold for signaling proteins or participate in translating cell surface receptor-mediated biochemical reactions to the cell movement machinery. Severing of actin filaments and nucleation of actin polymerization are essential for the remodeling of the cortical actin network that accompanies nearly all types of cell activation. Precise actin cytoskeleton remodeling requires tight spatial and temporal regulation of actin filament assembly and organization.

The BRCA1-hMSH2 association involved several well-defined regions of both proteins which include the adenosine nucleotide binding domain of hMSH2. Moreover, the interaction of BRCA1 with purified hMSH2-hMSH6 appears to be modulated by adenosine nucleotide much like G protein downstream interaction/signaling is modulated by guanosine nucleotide. BARD1, another BRCA1-interacting protein, was also found to interact with hMSH2. In addition, BRCA1 was found to associate with both hMSH3 and hMSH6, the heterodimeric partners of hMSH2. These observations implicate BRCA1/BARD1 as downstream effectors of the adenosine nucleotide-activated hMSH2-hMSH6 signaling complex, and suggest a global role for BRCA1 in DNA damage processing. The functional interaction between BRCA1 and hMSH2 may provide a partial explanation for the background of gynecological and colorectal cancer in both HNPCC and BRCA1 kindreds, respectively."

Despite this high T c , the magnitude of the ordered moment at room temperatures is on the order of 10 −4 Bohr magneton per formula unit. These properties are rather similar to those of doped divalent hexaborides, such as Ca 1− x La x B 6 . The calculated electronic states also show similarity near the Fermi level between CaB 2 C 2 and divalent hexaborides. However, there is an important difference: CaB 2 C 2 crystallizes in a tetragonal structure, and there are no equivalent pockets in the energy bands for electrons and holes—in contrast with CaB 6 . Thus, the disputed threefold degeneracy, specific to the cubic structure, in the energy bands of divalent hexaborides turns out not to be essential for high-temperature ferromagnetism. It is the peculiar molecular orbitals near the Fermi level that appear to be crucial to the high- T c ferromagnetism."

https://openalex.org/W2088149423,"The MORF4-RelatedGene on chromosome 15 (MRG15) is a member of a novel family of genes originally identified in studies to reveal cell senescence-inducing factors. MRG15 contains several predicted protein motifs, including a nuclear localization signal, a helix-loop-helix region, a leucine zipper, and a chromodomain. These motifs are commonly associated with transcription factors, suggesting that MRG15 may likewise function as a transcriptional regulator. To examine the potential function(s) of MRG15, we sought to identify cellular factors associated with thisMRG family member. In this regard, we have found that both the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) and a novel nuclear protein PAM14 (Protein Associated with MRG,14 kDa) specifically associate with MRG15. We have further demonstrated that these interactions require the helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains of MRG15. Interestingly we have found all three proteins present in a multiprotein complex, suggesting that at least some of their functions may be interdependent. Although the functions of PAM14 have yet to be elucidated, Rb has several well characterized activities, including repression of E2F-activated promoters such as that of B-myb. Significantly we have demonstrated that MRG15 blocks the Rb-induced repression of this promoter, leading toB-myb promoter activation. Collectively these results suggest that MRG15 regulates transcription through interactions with a cellular protein complex containing Rb and PAM14.

Pereira-Smith O.M. Science. 1996; 273: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In studies to identify cell senescence-related genes, we cloned MORF41(MORtality Factor on chromosome 4), a novel gene that induces a senescent phenotype upon introduction into a subset of immortal human cell lines (2Bertram M.J. Pereira-Smith O.M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that MORF4 is a member of a novel gene family whose protein products share several common structural motifs, including a nuclear localization signal, a helix-loop-helix region, and a leucine zipper. As these domains are frequently found in transcriptional regulators, we hypothesized that the MORF4 family members may function similarly to regulate transcription. Consistent with this possibility we have previously established that members of this family are localized within the nucleus of cells (2Bertram M.J. Pereira-Smith O.M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Upon cloning each member of the MORF4 gene family, we found that in addition to MORF4, only two of the other family members were expressed, MRG15 and MRGX(MORF4-Related Genes found on chromosomes 15 and X, respectively) (2Bertram M.J. Pereira-Smith O.M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).MRG15 is of particular interest because it is expressed in a wide variety of human tissue types and is highly conserved across multiple species, including flies (Drosophila melanogaster), worms (Caenorhabditis elegans), yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and plants (Arabidopsis thaliana) (3Bone J.R. Kuroda M.I. Genetics. 1996; 144: 705-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cross-species conservation suggests that MRG15 possesses an activity fundamentally important to one or more cellular processes. Sequence alignment data demonstrate that MRG15 is nearly identical to MORF4 (96% amino acid similarity). UnlikeMORF4, however, MRG15 fails to induce a senescent phenotype upon introduction into immortal cell lines, andMRG15 RNA levels decline with the onset of senescence (2Bertram M.J. Pereira-Smith O.M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The most striking structural difference between MRG15 and MORF4 is that MRG15 contains an additional predicted domain at its amino terminus that codes for a region known as a chromodomain. The chromodomain is a motif identified in several proteins that function as negative or positive regulators of transcription, including proteins from D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae such as the Msl-3, polycomb, HP1, and SWI/SNF proteins (4Kennison J.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 5Koonin E.V. Zhou S. Lucchesi J.C.

These regulators do not appear to bind DNA directly but rather associate indirectly with specific sites on chromatin via interactions with transcriptional repressors or activators as well as with proteins that influence chromatin accessibility to such transcriptional regulators. The Msl-3 protein, for example, has been implicated in the regulation of dosage compensation in Drosophila by acting in a multimeric complex that binds to hundreds of specific sites on the male X chromosome and induces hypertranscription likely through modification of chromatin structure (8Bashaw G.J. Baker B.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly MRG15 exhibits sequence similarity to theDrosophila Msl-3 protein over its entirety, suggesting that MRG15 may similarly affect gene expression in cells by associating with specific transcription factors in multimeric nuclear complexes. The fact that the chromodomain and leucine zipper motifs have been implicated in protein-protein interactions suggested that MRG15 associates with one or more cellular factors. Therefore, identification of such interacting proteins is expected to provide critical insight into MRG15 function. We report here the identification of two MRG15-associated factors as a novel nuclear protein PAM14 (Protein Associated with MRG,14 kDa) and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb). Rb is known to repress the promoters of many genes, including those involved in cell cycle progression (9Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These results suggest that MRG15 forms a nuclear protein complex with PAM14 and Rb that may function to control transcription from Rb-regulated promoters. Commercially available rabbit hemagglutinin (HA) polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit polyclonal Rb (C-15) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for immunoblot analysis. The polyclonal MRG15 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with a peptide containing the sequence from the 5′-chromodomain region of the protein (DEWVPESRVLK) and was used for immunoblot analysis. Commercially available HA monoclonal antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or Rb monoclonal antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation assays. Commercially available anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Pierce) were also used. Wild-type and mutant B-mybpromoter constructs in the pGL2 luciferase reporter (wt myband mut myb) were generously provided by N. Dyson (13Lam E.W. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The mutant B-myb promoter-reporter construct contains a mutation in the E2F binding site (deletion of nucleotides −208 to −206) that eliminates Rb binding and repression. To isolate the full-lengthPAM14 cDNA, an internal primer was synthesized and used for rapid amplification of cDNA ends with the AP1 primer (CLONTECH). The resulting amplicons were directly ligated to the PCRII vector using a TA cloning strategy (Invitrogen). The inserts corresponding to the 5′-end of the PAM14cDNA were sequenced, and the following primers were used to amplify the open reading frame from a human heart library (CLONTECH): 5′-CCGAAGCTTCCACCATGCGGCCCCTGG-3′ and 5′-GGCGGATCCAGGG- TGTCAGCCAATCTC-3′. The 424-base pair product was cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of the EGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) vectors and the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) expression tag vector pGEX4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate PAM14:EGFP-N1, PAM14:pcDNA3.1, and PAM14:pGEX4T1, respectively. A HA tag was introduced at the carboxyl terminus of PAM14:pcDNA3.1 by polymerase chain reaction methods. The MRG15 cDNA was introduced into theSalI/NotI sites of pGEX4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the BamHI/SalI sites of the pGBT9 yeast two-hybrid bait vector, and the BamHI/XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1 to generate MRG15:Pgex4T1, MRG15:pGBT9, and MRG15:pcDNA3.1, respectively. A HA tag was placed at the carboxyl terminus of MRG15 in pcDNA3.1 by polymerase chain reaction methods. MRG15-GST mutants lacking the chromodomain (−CHR), helix-loop-helix (−HLH), or leucine-zipper (−LEU) domain were generated by inverse polymerase chain reaction of wild-typeMRG15 and cloned into the PstI site of pGEX4T1 to generate −CHR:pGEX4T1, −HLH:pGEX4T1, and −LEU:pGEX4T1, respectively. Primer pairs used to create the respective constructs were: −CHR 5′-GCCCTGCAGCTCAAATACGTGGACACC-3′ and −CHR 5′-GCCCTGCAGAAGAAGAGGCCCATGAAAGC-3′, −HLH 5′-AAAACTGCAGGATTCCATTCTTGATTATGC-3′ and −HLH 5′-AAAACTGCAGGGTACTGCCACCATCTCCATTTCC-3′, and −LEU 5′-GCCCTGAGGCCAGCGATTATGAAGTG-3′ and −LEU 5′-GCCTGCAGCTCATCCAGAGGTGTATA-3′. All constructs were verified by sequencing and restriction enzyme analysis. CMV-transformed human fibroblasts (CMV-MJ-Hel1), EJ bladder carcinoma-derived cells, HeLa cervical carcinoma cells, and Saos2 osteosarcoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Hanks' minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate stable clones of cells expressing HA-tagged PAM14, CMV-MJ-Hel1 and EJ cells were transfected with PAM-HA:pcDNA3.1. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, 3,000–10,000 cells/60-mm dish cells were subcultured into Earl's minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with G418 (1 mg/ml). After a 2-week incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, several clones were isolated and maintained in medium containing G418. PAM14-HA expression in each clone was verified by immunoblot analysis. CMV-MJ-Hel1 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish and transfected 24 h later with the indicated plasmids. At 24 h post-transfection the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus). For confocal microscopy, CMV-MJ-Hel1 cells stably expressing PAM14-HA were seeded at 2 × 105 cells on glass coverslips in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. Approximately 24 h post-transfection the cells were transfected with the MRG15:GFP construct. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. The cells were incubated first with rabbit HA polyclonal antibodies (1:500) and mouse monoclonal green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibodies (1:500). The cells were then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:250) (Molecular Probes) and Texas-red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (1:250) (Molecular Probes). All antibodies were diluted in IF buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl) and incubated at 37 °C. Coverslips with attached cells were rinsed briefly in a 0.5 µg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solution, and coverslips were affixed to microscope slides with mounting medium (VectorShield). Microscopy was performed using an Applied Precision DeltaVision microscope (Issaquah, WA) fitted with an Olympus IX70 microscope. Images were acquired via wide field sectioning using fluorescent light. The stacked images, usually 20–25 sections, were subjected to point spread function analysis for better image quality on Silicon Graphics software (SGI, Mountain View, CA). Magnification of all cells was maintained at 600×. PAM14-HA was seen as red, MRG15-GFP as green, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear staining as blue. A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). MRG15:pGBT9 (bait) and a human fibroblast cDNA library (a gift from J. Campisi) cloned into the activator plasmid pGAD424 were transformed into the PJ69-4A yeast strain (a gift from J. Campisi), which contains three different inducible reporter markers for adenine, histidine, and β-galactosidase synthesis. Plasmid DNA was isolated using DNA extraction buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), 0.2 ml of phenol/chloroform (1:1), and 0.3 g of glass beads. Plasmid DNA derived from each yeast colony was transformed into the DH5αEscherichia coli strain, and the DNA inserts were sequenced to determine the identity of the interacting clones. The prey plasmids identified in the screen were each retransformed with theMRG15 bait plasmid by the lithium acetate method (16Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar) and selected on plates lacking tryptophan and leucine. These yeast were streaked on plates under selection for adenine, tryptophan, and leucine synthesis where growth indicated an interaction between the two proteins that activated an inducible reporter marker. These colonies were subsequently streaked on plates lacking histidine, adenine, tryptophan, and leucine to increase the stringency in the tests for interaction. In addition, liquid β-galactosidase reporter assays (Promega) were performed to assess the strength of the protein interactions. The bacterial cell line BL21 (Stratagene) was transformed with the indicated plasmid, and expression of the GST fusion protein was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-galactoside for 3 h at 37 °C. A small aliquot was removed from the bacterial cultures, lysed in 2× sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and Coomassie-stained to verify expression of the fusion proteins. The bacterial lysates were subsequently harvested and purified on Sepharose 4B glutathione beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For GST pull-down assays with cell lysates, EJ or Saos2 cells transiently transfected with the indicated expression plasmids were harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Bead-immobilized GST-tagged proteins were incubated with the lysates for 3 h, then washed four times in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), solubilized in 2× sample buffer, run on an SDS-polyacrylamide protein gel, and either transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for immunoblot analysis or silver-stained using the Silver Stain Plus Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For GST pull-down assays within vitro transcribed/translated products, in vitro transcription/translation was performed on the indicated plasmid constructs using the T7 Single Tube Protein kit (Novagen). In vitro transcribed/translated protein products were then inoculated with the GST proteins and glutathione-Sepharose beads in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) for 2 h, then washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and developed by autoradiography. Protein A/G BioMag beads (Polysciences) were preincubated with 8 µg of HA or Rb monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts of EJ and CMV-MJ-HeL1 clones stably expressing PAM14-HA were prepared by resuspension of cells in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and higher salt extraction of proteins in the nuclear pellet in buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25% sucrose). The lysate was then incubated with the antibody-bound beads for 3 h at 4 °C, washed four times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. EJ cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids and harvested with Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), and the luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer. The data was normalized to the amount of protein in the samples as determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase assays were performed in triplicate to verify reproducibility, and protein assays were performed in duplicate. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test. MRG15 encodes several motifs implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that this protein associates with other cellular factors. Therefore, to identify potential MRG15-interacting proteins, we screened a human fibroblast cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid assay using full-length MRG15 as bait. A total of 2 × 105 transformants were screened, yielding seven colonies that grew under selection. The strength of each interaction was assessed by β-galactosidase reporter activity upon co-transfection of MRG15 and the plasmids expressing each interacting protein into yeast (data not shown), and the strongest interacting protein, PAM14, was isolated for further analysis. As further verification of this interaction, yeast co-expressing PAM14 and MRG15 or the positive controls SV40 T antigen and p53 were competent for growth under −adenine/tryptophan/leucine (−ATL) and −histidine/adenine/tryptophan/leucine (−HATL) amino acid selection, whereas yeast co-expressing the SV40 T antigen and either PAM14 or MRG15 failed to grow under selection (TableI). Thus, MRG15 and PAM14 are not intrinsic trans-activating proteins. Interestingly, unlike many leucine zipper proteins, MRG15 was not found to homodimerize in this system (Table I).Table IInteraction of PAM14 with MRG15 in yeast two-hybrid assaysGal4 DBD1-bGal4 DBD represents the bait plasmid containing the indicated gene as a fusion with the Gal4 DNA binding domain as well as a gene allowing selection on media lacking tryptophan.Gal4 TD1-cGal4 TD represents the prey plasmid containing the indicated gene as a fusion with the Gal4 transactivation domain as well as a gene allowing selection on media lacking leucine.Growth1-aGrowth on yeast plates lacking tryptophan and leucine (−TL) indicates the presence of both bait and prey plasmids in the yeast strain, whereas growth on plates also lacking adenine (−ATL) or adenine and histidine (−HATL) indicates interaction between the bait and prey proteins as this leads to activation of a Gal4 promoter and subsequent transcription of genes required for adenine and histidine synthesis.−TL−ATL−HATLp53SV40 T+++MRG15SV40 T+−−PAM14SV40 T+−−MRG15MRG15+−−MRG15PAM14+++1-a Growth on yeast plates lacking tryptophan and leucine (−TL) indicates the presence of both bait and prey plasmids in the yeast strain, whereas growth on plates also lacking adenine (−ATL) or adenine and histidine (−HATL) indicates interaction between the bait and prey proteins as this leads to activation of a Gal4 promoter and subsequent transcription of genes required for adenine and histidine synthesis.1-b Gal4 DBD represents the bait plasmid containing the indicated gene as a fusion with the Gal4 DNA binding domain as well as a gene allowing selection on media lacking tryptophan.1-c Gal4 TD represents the prey plasmid containing the indicated gene as a fusion with the Gal4 transactivation domain as well as a gene allowing selection on media lacking leucine. Open table in a new tab Cloning and sequencing of the full-length PAM14 revealed it to be a 1205-nucleotide cDNA encoding a novel 14-kDa protein of 127 amino acids (GenBankTM accession number AF116272) (Fig. 1). Secondary structure analysis (Expasy) predicts this protein primarily consists of a coiled-coil helical structure throughout its length. To physically examine the MRG15-PAM14 interaction, we performed GST pull-down assays and found that the MRG15-GST fusion protein but not GST alone bound HA-tagged PAM14 (PAM14-HA) (Fig. 2A). Likewise, in the converse experiment, PAM14-GST but not GST alone bound HA-tagged MRG15 (MRG15-HA) (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the interaction between these two cellular factors is direct as MRG15-GST retained the ability to bind in vitro transcribed and translated PAM14 (Fig. 2B).Figure 2MRG15 and PAM14 interact in vitro.A, wild-type MRG15-GST interacts with PAM14-HA.

Asterisks indicate location of each fusion protein. D, the MRG15 helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains are required for interaction with PAM14. GST pull-down assays were performed as described in A using the indicated wild-type or mutant MRG15-GST fusion proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the domain(s) of the MRG15 protein required for interaction with PAM14, we generated a panel of MRG15-GST deletion mutants lacking the predicted structural domains (Fig. 2C) and demonstrated that the wild-type and mutant GST fusion proteins were expressed to equivalent levels (Fig. 2D). In GST pull-down assays, the MRG15 mutant lacking the amino-terminal chromodomain (−CHR) bound PAM14 with similar affinity as wild-type MRG15 (Fig.2E). By contrast, the MRG15 mutants lacking either the helix-loop-helix region (-HLH) or leucine zipper (−LEU) failed to bind PAM14 (Fig. 2E). Thus, these results suggest that the helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains but not the chromodomain of MRG15 are important for interaction with PAM14. We next sought to determine the subcellular localization of PAM14 by examining cells expressing GFP-tagged PAM14 using fluorescence microscopy. Interestingly GFP-PAM14 localized to the nucleus of human cells but was excluded from the nucleoli (Fig.3A), an expression pattern similar to that previously observed for GFP-tagged MRG15. In accordance with these results, we observed co-localization of PAM14 and MRG15 in HeLa cell nuclei by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3B). Although we predict the interaction between MRG15 and PAM14 to be significant, the lack of knowledge regarding PAM14 function made it difficult to gain insight into MRG15 function based on its association with this novel protein. We therefore attempted to identify additional MRG15-associated proteins with more established cellular functions. To this end, we performed GST pull-down assays of EJ cell nuclear extracts using MRG15-GST to identify MRG15-associated cellular factors. MRG15-GST-bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining, and bands unique to the MRG15-GST pull-down assay not detected in pull-down assays with GST alone were catalogued. As an additional control, the MRG15-GST protein not incubated with lysate was examined simultaneously to identify contaminating bacterial protein bands and MRG15-GST breakdown products. Pull-down assays were performed multiple times under conditions of increasing stringency, and in each of these experiments we consistently observed a MRG15-associated protein with an approximate molecular mass of 100 kDa (p100) (Fig.4A). To identify this protein, we obtained antibodies to several known nuclear proteins of the appropriate molecular weight, including Rb (17Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar), p107 (18Classon M. Dyson N. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and p130 (18Classon M. Dyson N. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and tested them in immunoblots of MRG15-GST pull-down reactions. Using this screening approach, we succeeded in identifying Rb as a second MRG15-associated cellular factor (Fig. 4B). To confirm the identity of Rb as a MRG15-associated protein, we performed similar GST pull-down experiments using lysates from Saos2 cells, which are known to lack functional Rb (Fig. 4B). As expected, we failed to detect the 100-kDa MRG15-associated band in these experiments, further suggesting that this MRG15-interacting protein is Rb. To determine the region(s) of the MRG15 protein required for the Rb interaction, we utilized the MRG15-GST deletion mutants described above (see Fig. 2C) in GST pull-down assays. Similar to our results with PAM14, the MRG15 deletion mutant lacking the amino-terminal chromodomain bound Rb with similar strength as wild-type MRG15, whereas the MRG15 mutants lacking the helix-loop-helix or leucine zipper domains failed to bind Rb (Fig. 4C). Thus, the helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper regions are important both for the interaction of MRG15 with PAM14 as well as with Rb. Our observations that similar MRG15 domains are important for binding both PAM14 and Rb might suggest that these interactions are mutually exclusive. Therefore, to determine whether all three proteins co-exist in a multiprotein complex or whether MRG15 binds only one of the cellular factors at a time, we performed immunoprecipitations from EJ and CMV-MJ-HeL1 cell lines stably expressing PAM14-HA. Upon immunoprecipitation of PAM14-HA from nuclear extracts of these cells, we observed co-immunoprecipitation of both MRG15 and Rb, suggesting that all three proteins were present in a multiprotein complex (Fig.5, A and B). Similar results were obtained when nuclear extracts from EJ and CMV-MJ-Hel1 clones were immunoprecipitated with an Rb antibody (Fig. 5,A and B), further suggesting that MRG15 is able to simultaneously complex with PAM14 and Rb. We next wanted to examine the functional significance of the MRG15-Rb interaction. Rb has well established roles in proliferation and differentiation through its ability to regulate"
https://openalex.org/W2082669037,"We searched iron-deficient inducible cDNA, using subtraction cloning and mRNA from desferrioxamine-treated mouse macrophage Raw264.7 cells. We identified a pleomorphic adenoma gene like 2 (PLAGL2), one of PLAG superfamily proteins exhibiting antiproliferative properties on tumor cells. Mouse PLAGL2 consists of 496 amino acids with seven C2H2 zinc-fingers. PLAGL2 mRNA was induced in RAW264.7 cells, mouse erythroleukemia cells and Balb/c 3T3 cells when they were treated with desferrioxamine. Hypoxia also increased PLAGL2 mRNA. Expression of PLAGL2 in COS-7 cells led to nuclear localization. PLAGL2 had potential binding ability to GC-rich oligonucleotide and activated transcription of a gene with the binding sequence in transient reporter assay, a finding consistent with a case seen in a PLAGL2 homolog, ZAC-1. Transient co-transfection of PLAGL2 or ZAC1 cDNA and a reporter containing a lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) promoter carrying the hypoxia inducible factor-1 responsive element led to an increase in the basal transcription in Balb/c 3T3 and HepG2 cells. Activation in transcription from the LDHA promoter increased by desferrioxamine treatment or hypoxia was further enhanced when PLAGL2 was expressed. We propose that PLAGL2 is involved in the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells by regulating iron depletion- or hypoxia-inducible gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2021701623,"Sensitivity to glucocorticoid (GC)-evoked apoptosis in lymphoid cell lines correlates closely with GC-mediated suppression of c-Myc expression. To establish a functional role for c-Myc in GC-mediated apoptosis, we have stably expressed MycER(TM), the human c-Myc protein fused to the modified ligand-binding domain of the murine estrogen receptor alpha, in GC-sensitive CEM-C7-14 cells. In CEM-C7-14 cells, MycER(TM) constitutively imparts c-Myc functions. Cells expressing MycER(TM) (C7-MycER(TM)) exhibited a marked reduction in cell death after 72 h in 100 nM dexamethasone (Dex), with 10-20-fold more viable cells when compared to the parental CEM-C7-14 clone. General GC responsiveness was not compromised, as evidenced by Dex-mediated suppression of endogenous c-Myc and cyclin D3, and induction of c-Jun and the glucocorticoid receptor. MycER(TM) also blunted Dex-mediated upregulation of p27(kipI) and suppression of the Myc target p53. In comparison to parental CEM-C7-14 cells, Dex-evoked DNA strand breaks were negligible and caspase activation was delayed, but the extent of G1 cell cycle arrest was similar in C7-MycER(TM) cells. Myc-ER(TM) did not result in permanent, complete resistance to GC however, and the GC-treated cells eventually died, indicative of redundant or interactive mechanisms in the GC-evoked lytic response of lymphoid cells. Our results emphasize the importance of c-Myc suppression in GC-evoked apoptosis of CEM-C7-14 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2331264478,"Members of the Myc oncoprotein network (c-Myc, Max, and Mad) play important roles in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We expressed chimeric green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions of c-Myc, Max, and three Mad proteins in fibroblasts. Individually, c-Myc and Mad proteins localized in subnuclear speckles, whereas Max assumed a homogeneous nuclear pattern. These distributions were co-dominant and dynamic, however, as each protein assumed the pattern of its heterodimeric partner when the latter was co-expressed at a higher level. Deletion mapping of two Mad members, Mad1 and Mxi1, demonstrated that the domains responsible for nuclear localization and speckling are separable. A non-speckling Mxi1 mutant was also less effective as a transcriptional repressor than wild-type Mxi1. c-Myc nuclear speckles were distinct from SC-35 domains involved in mRNA processing. However, in the presence of co-expressed Max, c-Myc, but not Mad, co-localized to a subset of SC-35 loci. These results show that Myc network proteins comprise dynamic subnuclear structures and behave co-dominantly when co-expressed with their normal heterodimerization partners. In addition, c-Myc-Max heterodimers, but not Max-Mad heterodimers, localize to foci actively engaged in pre-mRNA transcription/processing. These findings suggest novel means by which Myc network members promote transcriptional activation or repression."
https://openalex.org/W1609754569,"The pyrG gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, encoding CTP synthase, has been cloned and sequenced. It is flanked upstream by an open reading frame showing homology to several aminotransferases and downstream by an open reading frame of unknown function. L. lactisstrains harboring disrupted pyrG alleles were constructed. These mutants required cytidine for growth, proving that in L. lactis, the pyrG product is the only enzyme responsible for the amination of UTP to CTP. In contrast to the situation in Escherichia coli, an L. lactis pyrG mutant could be constructed in the presence of a functionalcdd gene encoding cytidine deaminase. A characterization of the enzyme revealed similar properties as found for CTP synthases from other organisms. However, unlike the majority of CTP synthases the lactococcal enzyme can convert dUTP to dCTP, although a half saturation concentration of 0.6 mm for dUTP makes it unlikely that this reaction plays a significant physiological role. As for other CTP synthases, the oligomeric structure of the lactococcal enzyme was found to be a tetramer, but unlike most of the other previously characterized enzymes, the tetramer was very stable even at dilute enzyme concentrations.

This demand can be met in two ways, either by de novo synthesis of nucleotides or by exploiting nucleotides, nucleosides, and nucleobases taken up from the surroundings through the salvage pathways. The de novosynthesis of pyrimidines seems to be universal. The pathway consists of six enzymatic reactions leading to UMP, which is subsequently converted into UTP and CTP (see Fig. 1). Most prokaryotes for which the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines has been studied possess only one allele of each gene responsible for the six enzymatic reactions. In lactococci there are, however, two different pyrD genes encoding dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (1Andersen P.S. Jansen P.J. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3975-3982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the protein encoded by the pyrDb gene needs the activity of the protein encoded by the pyrK gene to be active and is organized as part of an operon, consisting also of pyrK andpyrF (2Andersen P.S. Martinussen J. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5005-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Lactococcus lactis carB gene encoding the catalytic subunit of carbamyl phosphate synthase has been cloned and was shown to be monocistronically transcribed (3Martinussen J. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4380-4386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ThepyrB gene encoding aspartate transcarbamylase and thecarA gene encoding the glutaminase subunit of carbamyl phosphate synthase are members of a four cistronic operon including the genes encoding the PyrR (pyrR) regulator and the high affinity uracil transporter (pyrP) (4Martinussen J. Schallert J. Andersen B. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of the genes pyrC encoding dihydroorotase andpyrE encoding orotate phosphoribosyltransferase has been shown, 1Jan Martinussen, unpublished results.1Jan Martinussen, unpublished results. thus establishing that the universal pathway leading to synthesis of UMP is also present in L. lactis. In most other Gram-positive bacteria the pyrimidine biosynthetic genes are organized in one large operon (5Elagöz A. Abdi A. Hubert J.C. Kammerer B. Gene. 1996; 182: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Ghim S.Y. Neuhard J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3698-3707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Li X. Weinstock G.M. Murray B.E. J.

Knowledge of the salvage pathways is important when studying the phenotype of auxotrophic pyr mutants. In contrast to thede novo synthesis of pyrimidines, the salvage pathways may vary between different organisms. However, the pathways by which uracil, uridine, deoxyuridine, cytidine, and deoxycytidine are metabolized in L. lactis seem to be quite similar to those found in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. Compared with E. coli, the only exceptions are that lactococci are unable to utilize cytosine and that L. lactisonly contain one pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase encoded bypdp (9Martinussen J. Andersen P.S. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1514-1516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Martinussen J. Hammer K. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As part of the elucidation of the salvage pathways in L. lactis, mutants blocked in various pyrimidine salvage genes have been isolated using different 5-fluoropyrimidine analogues (10Martinussen J. Hammer K. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These include mutations in genes encoding uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (upp), uridine/cytidine kinase (udk), pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (pdp), cytidine/deoxycytidine deaminase (cdd), and thymidine kinase (tdk). Furthermore, the upp gene of L. lactis has been cloned and characterized (11Martinussen J. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6457-6463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pyrimidine salvage pathways, as verified in the present in L. lactis, are shown in Fig. 1. Studies of the pathways converting UMP to other pyrimidine derivatives in lactococci were initiated with the recent description of apyrH-encoded UMP kinase as responsible for synthesis of UDP from UMP (12Wadskov-Hansen S.L. Martinussen J. Hammer K. Gene. 2000; 241: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These pathways are further elucidated with the present communication, which establishes the presence of apyrG-encoded CTP synthase (EC 6.3.4.2.) as responsible for synthesis of CTP from UTP in L. lactis. In the presence of Mg2+ the enzyme catalyzes the reaction ATP + UTP + glutamine → ADP + Pi + CTP + glutamate. The glutamine-dependent amination of UTP to CTP is activated allosterically by GTP. Our studies included cloning and sequencing ofpyrG from L. lactis and the construction of different pyrG disruption and deletion mutants as well as enzymatic characterization of the gene product. The methods described by Sambrook et al. (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) were used for the extraction and manipulation of plasmid DNA and general DNA in vitromethods. Chromosomal lactococcal DNA was prepared as described by Johansen and Kibenich (14Johansen E. Kibenich A. J. Dairy Sci. 1992; 75: 1186-1191Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DNA sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit in accordance with the protocol of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or using an ABI PRISM 310 DNA Sequencer as recommended by the supplier (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR2amplification of DNA was performed using standard methods. E. coli cells were transformed after CaCl2 treatment as described (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), and L. lactis was transformed by electroporation (15Holo H. Nes I.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 47: 195-199PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids pSH105 and pSH106 (Fig.2) were made in the following way. A 1.4-kilobase internal fragment of pyrG from L. lactis MG1363 (16Gasson M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained by PCR using the degenerate primers pyrG1a, 5′-CCCAAGCTTAYATHAAYGTNGAYCC-3′, and pyrG2b, 5′-CGGGATCCRAAYTCNGGRTGRAAYTG-3′, which were designed based on a primary sequence alignment of the CTP synthases from E. coliand B. subtilis. Subsequently the fragment was cloned in theEcoRV site of the commercial PCR cloning vector pMOSBlue T-vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). From this construct the 1.4-kilobase fragment was excised with BamHI and ligated into BamHI-digested pRC1, and the plasmid was named pSH105. pRC1 (17Le Bourgeois P. Lautier M. Mata M. Ritzenthaler P. Gene. 1992; 111: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) cannot replicate in L. lactis but contains an erm gene conferring erythromycin resistance in both E. coli and L. lactis. Plasmid pSH106 was constructed from pSH105 by deleting a 0.4-kilobase SacI fragment. Hence, pSH106 also cannot replicate in L. lactisbut is carrying the erythromycin resistance gene. The deoxy oligonucleotides PYRG LL5A, 5′-GGAATTCGAGGAGATTTAGATGTCAAC-3′, that overlap the 5′ end and PYRG LL3A, 5′-AAAACTGCAGTTATTTACTATTTTCAACAGC-3′, that overlap the 3′ end of L. lactis pyrG were used to amplify the gene by PCR using chromosomal DNA from MG1363 as a template. The sequences encoding the pyrG ribosome binding site, the start codon, and translation stop signal are indicated by italicized letters. The unique EcoRI and PstI restrictions sites of the PCR product inserted by the oligonucleotides are indicated in the sequence by underlining and were used for cloning of the pyrG fragment after the PA1 promotor (18Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar) of the vector pUHE23–2. The resultant plasmid pMW602 was verified by sequencing and transformed into SØ5393, a Leu+ derivative of the E. coli pyrG strain JF622 (19Friesen J.D. Parker J. Watson R.J. Fill N.P. Pedersen S. Pedersen F.S. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 127: 917-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which also carries an F′ with lacIQ and Tn5 in lacZ. The resulting plasmid-carrying strain SØ5399 was used for overexpression of the L. lactis pyrG. Lactococcal cultures were grown either on M17 glucose broth (20Terzaghi B.E. Sandine W.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 807-813Crossref Google Scholar) or on synthetic SA medium based on MOPS and containing 7 vitamins and 19 amino acids (21Jensen P.R. Hammer K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 4363-4366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in both cases supplied with glucose to 1% (w/v).E. coli cultures were grown either on LB medium (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) or synthetic AB medium (22Clark D.J. Maaloe O. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 23: 99-112Crossref Scopus (706) Google Scholar). L. lactis was cultured at 30 °C in filled culture flasks without aeration. E. coli in batch cultures was grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. For all plates, agar was added to 15 g liter−1. When needed, the following was added to the different media: cytidine at 20 or 50 μg ml−1, uracil at 20 μg ml−1, erythromycin at 1 μg ml−1 for lactococci, and 150 μg ml−1for E. coli, and ampicillin at 100 μg ml−1. PyrG mutants were constructed in L .lactis subsp.cremoris MG1363 (12Wadskov-Hansen S.L. Martinussen J. Hammer K. Gene. 2000; 241: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and its cdd derivative MB109 (9Martinussen J. Andersen P.S. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1514-1516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by transforming the strains with the plasmid pSH106, which contains a disrupted pyrG gene. Since the plasmid cannot replicate inL. lactis, selection for erythromycin results in transformants that harbor the nonreplicating plasmid integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination in the pyrGregion. The selections were performed using SA medium and cytidine 50 μg ml−1 and erythromycin at 1 μg ml−1. LKH 278 was derived in this way from MG1363, whereas LKH 280 was derived from MB109. Cytidine deaminase activity in crude extracts fromL. lactis was assayed at 30 °C as previously described (9Martinussen J. Andersen P.S. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1514-1516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the spectroscopic assay developed by Beck et al. (24Beck C.F. Ingraham J.L. Neuhard J. Thomassen E. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 110: 219-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pyrG gene fromL. lactis MG1363 was sequenced using the Easy Gene Walking method (25Harrison R.W. Miller J.C. D'Souza M.J. Kampo G. Biotechniques. 1997; 22: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For PCR with Chromosomal DNA from MG1363 two sets of oligonucleotides pyrG6a, 5′-GAAAAATGGTTCACGCCG-3′, pyrG7a, 5′-TGCCAACGATGTGACCG-3′, and pyrG8a, 5′-GGCAAAAAATTCTTCGTTGC-3′, and pyrG6b, 5′-GAAATATAAGCATCTGGC-3′, pyrG7b 5′-TTGGCACTTCACTGCGC-3′, and pyrG8b, 5′-TCAGTTGTTGTTGCTGC-3′, designed to anneal to each end of the internal pyrG fragment of pSH105, were used together with partly degenerate oligonucleotides containing anEcoRI (5′-NNNNNNNNNNGAATTC-3′), HindIII (5′-NNNNNNNNNNAAGCTT-3′), or Sau3AI (5′-NNNNNNNNNNGATC-3′) restriction site. Fragments covering both ends of the DNA regions flanking pyrG were obtained in combination with all three degenerate oligonucleotides. Direct sequencing of the PCR fragments was done without prior cloning to eliminate the risk of errors caused by mutations in individual PCR fragments. Based on the sequences obtained, a PCR fragment covering the entire pyrG open reading frame and adjacent sequence was made using the oligonucleotides SLLH6, 5′-ACTTTGACAAAAAAGG-3′, and SLLH7, 5′-TACAAAAGATTTTGGGC-3′, and chromosomal DNA from MG1353 as a template. The direct sequencing of this PCR fragment on both strands revealed minor errors in the sequence determined by Easy Gene Walking (less than 0.5%). By combining the sequence data, the total sequence of pyrG and flanking regions was obtained. E. coli strain SØ5399 was grown in 1 liter of LB medium with the addition of ampicillin to an OD436 of 0.8. Then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cultivation was continued for 2.5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min in a Sorvall rotor SLA3000. The cells were washed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, divided in three portions of ∼1 g of wet cell paste and stored at −-20 °C. The purification was performed at 4 °C unless otherwise noted and is described for the amount of protein obtained from about 1 g of cell paste. Cells were thawed on ice, resuspended in 15 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5 and 2 mm DTT), and opened using a Sonics Vibra-Cell ultrasonic processor. Cell debris was sedimented by centrifugation in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was made 1% (w/v) with streptomycin sulfate, and centrifugation was repeated as above. A fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation was performed by first adding 6.3 g of ammonium sulfate (∼ 35% saturated) to the supernatant while gently stirring the precipitate and centrifugation was repeated as above. To the supernatant, 4.2 g of ammonium sulfate (∼60% saturated) was added, and centrifugation was repeated as above. The precipitate (about 10–15 mg of CTP synthase) was dissolved in 10 ml of extraction buffer and loaded on to a column (2.6 × 28 cm) of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amerham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer and placed at room temperature. With a flow rate of 3 ml min−1, the column was washed with 300 ml of extraction buffer followed by an isocratic elution of the protein with a solution containing 30% ethylene glycol, 0.5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 2 mm DTT. The fractions containing CTP synthase were pooled, and 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, with 20 mm DTT was added to a final concentration of 20 mm potassium phosphate. The protein was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation and collected by centrifugation as above. The precipitate was dissolved in 5 ml of extraction buffer and loaded onto a column (2.6 × 7.5) of phenyl-Sepharose equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein started to elute after one column volume of buffer (40 ml), and the next 80 ml of eluent were collected. The CTP synthase-containing fractions were precipitated by 60% ammonium sulfate as above and redissolved in 2 ml of buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and 2 mm DTT). The protein was dialyzed against 2 × 1 liter of the same buffer for 24 h. Finally, the enzyme was loaded on a HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with the same buffer as above with a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 in portions of 1 ml, and the protein fractions were collected. The highly reproducible purification procedure presented above involving two runs of hydrophobic chromatography appears to take advantage of a hysteretic effect on the retaining capacity of phenyl-Sepharose for L. lactis CTP synthase that depends on the protein concentration of the loaded sample. CTP synthase was prepared to near homogeneity as judged from SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). The overall purification fold was not determined but could be estimated from SDS-PAGE to be about 2–3-fold due to the very high overproduction of enzyme. The protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid procedure (27Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18590) Google Scholar) with reagents provided by Pierce and with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The specific activity of the L. lactis CTP synthase ranged from 2.5 to 3 μmol min−1mg−1 when determined as described below. The enzyme could be stored frozen at -20 °C for several months without loss of activity. All chemicals were from Sigma. Enzyme activity was determined at 30 °C by following the increase in absorbance at 291 nm using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 17 UV-visible spectrophotometer (28Long C.W. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and activities were calculated using the molar extinction coefficients Δε = 1338 m−1cm−1 or Δε = 1664 m−1cm−1 (29Pappas A. Park T.S. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16671-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) for the conversion of UTP to CTP or dUTP to dCTP, respectively. The standard assay was performed in 150 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 27 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm UTP, 0.1 mm GTP, and 10 mmglutamine. When nucleotide concentrations were varied, the MgCl2 concentration was always maintained at an excess of 25 mm. CTP synthase was added to concentrations between 3 and 25 μg ml−1. All initial velocities were determined in duplicate at two different enzyme concentrations. Calculation of kinetic constants was performed by fitting the initial velocities to one of the five equations below using the computer program UltraFit (BioSoft, version 3.01). The reported standard errors are those calculated by the computer program. Equation 1 is for a two-substrate sequential mechanism where each substrate shows cooperative binding that is independent of the binding of the other. Equations 2 and 3apply to hyperbolic and sigmoid saturation kinetics, respectively, Equation 4 applies to hyperbolic activation, and Equation 5 is for cooperative inhibition.υ=VappAnABnB/(Si0.5AnAS0.5BnB+S0.5AnABnB+S0.5BnBAnA+AnABnB)Equation 1 υ=VappA/(KM+A)Equation 2 υ=VappAn/(S0.5n+An)Equation 3 υ=V1+V2A/(KA+A)Equation 4 υ=VappIC50n/(IC50n+In)Equation 5 where v is the initial velocity,Vapp is the apparent maximal velocity,Si0.5 and S0.5 are the concentrations of substrates or activators, A or B, denoted when appropriate, at apparent half-maximal velocity at infinite small or saturating concentrations of the other substrate or activator, respectively, Km and KA are the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant for substrate or activator A, respectively, n is the Hill coefficient, denoted when appropriate, V1 and V2are the velocities in the absence and in the presence of activator, respectively, IC50 is the concentration of inhibitor I at half-maximal inhibition. Unless otherwise noted, all reported kinetic velocities are in μmol of CTP min−1 mg−1. The calculation of the free Mg2+ concentration was performed using a stability constant of 73,000m−1 for the Mg2+ and nucleoside triphosphate complexes (30O'Sullivan W.J. Smithers G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 294-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For gel-filtration experiments, a prepacked Bio-Prep S.E.1000/17 column from Bio-Rad was equilibrated at room temperature with buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and 2 mm DTT). Fifty-microliter samples of (i) a calibration standard (Bio-Rad) containing thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1.35 kDa), (ii) a mix of thyroglobuline, catalase (232 kDa), and ovalbumin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or (iii) CTP synthase (13–65 μg) was loaded onto the column with a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1. Protein elution from the column was monitored at 280 nm. Furthermore, the position of elution of the individual proteins in the calibration standards was also evaluated by SDS-PAGE analysis of the collected fractions. Chemical cross-linking experiments were performed in two ways. (i) CTP synthase (0.75 mg ml−1) was incubated at room temperature in 100 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT with either 0.1% or 1% of glutaraldehyde for 30 min. Apart from the difference in glutaraldehyde concentration four incubation conditions were used that contained enzyme alone, enzyme in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2, enzyme in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm ATP, or enzyme in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm UTP. Samples were then removed and prepared for analysis by SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). (ii) CTP synthase (25 or 250 μg ml−1) was incubated in the absence of MgCl2 and nucleotides with 0.1% or 1% glutaraldehyde as above, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 200 mm. Subsequently, all samples were concentrated on Millipore ULTRAFREE-MC 30.000 NMWL filter units, and about 10 μg of protein from each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The molecular weight of the protein bands was calculated using a high range molecular weight marker from Bio-Rad. Dynamic light-scattering was performed on a DynaPro MSXTC apparatus thermostated to 30 °C, and samples were prepared in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT. Light-scattering was determined twice on 15-μl samples of CTP synthase at concentrations ranging from 5 to 0.05 mg ml−1. Each protein dilution was passed through an ULTRAFREE-MC 0.22-μm filter unit. One measurement consisted of 20 acquisitions of 10 s. Analysis of the light-scattering data was done with the software Dynamics V6 supplied with the DynaPro instrument using standard settings for a general aqueous buffer solution of protein (phosphate-buffered saline) with a refractive index at 589 nm and 20 °C of 1.33, a viscosity coefficient of 1.019 at 20 °C, a Cauchy coefficient of 3119 nm2, a solvent intensity of 0, and a temperature model for an aqueous solution. From the peaks derived from CTP synthase, the calculated hydrodynamic radii and polydispersities are reported and compared with those obtained with catalase whose tetramer has a similar molecular mass as the CTP synthase tetramer. The sequence of L. lactis PyrG was obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Southern blot analysis verified that the PCR fragment cloned into pSH105 (Fig. 2) originated from MG1363 (data not shown). Analysis of the DNA sequence using the GeneMark program (31Lukashin A.V. Borodovsky M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) indicated a consensus Shine-Dalgarno motif (GAGGAG) spaced six nucleotides upstream of the deduced translational initiation site of thepyrG reading frame (nucleotide 898–2505) encoding a 537-amino acid polypeptide with a Mr of 59,455. When the deduced amino acid sequence of the L. lactis CTP synthase was submitted to a BLAST search, it revealed identities between 36 and 77% with that of other CTP synthases. Of particular interest is maybe the E. coli sequence, which showed 47% identity with that of L. lactis CTP synthase. The lactococcal pyrG is flanked by two open reading frames. The upstream reading frame orf81 (nucleotides 1–248) encodes 81 C-terminal amino acids of a polypeptide that shows homology to several aspartate aminotransferases. The downstream open reading frame (nucleotide 2717–3052) encoding polypeptide of 116 amino acids, named orf116, is preceded with a spacing of 5 base pairs by a good ribosome binding site motif (AGGAAA). The orf116 does not show homology to any known open reading frames in the data bases. The DNA sequence was submitted to the EMBL data library and was assigned the accession number AJ010153. IfpyrG is the only functional gene encoding CTP synthase inL. lactis, a gene disruption would result in a cytidine requirement, i.e. the cell would be restricted to acquire CTP through uptake and subsequent phosphorylation of cytidine. InE. coli and Salmonella typhimurium, exogenously added cytidine is rapidly deaminated to uridine by cytidine deaminase encoded by cdd, and hence, a cdd inactivation is needed to isolate a pyrG mutant (32Beck C.F. Ingraham J.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1971; 111: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 33Weng M. Makaroff C.A. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5568-5574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, thepyrG mutation in L. lactis was established in MB109 (10Martinussen J. Hammer K. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a cdd derivative of MG1363. Plasmid pSH106 was transformed into MB109 and, by selecting for erythromycin resistance, transformants were obtained in which this nonreplicating plasmid had integrated into the chromosome. 12 transformants were tested for the ability to grow without cytidine, and all 12 were found to have a cytidine requirement, which, as expected, could not be satisfied by the addition of uracil. These results strongly indicate that the clonedpyrG gene encodes the only physiological relevant CTP synthase in L. lactis. Chromosomal DNA from one of thepyrG mutants was extracted, and the pyrG mutation due to the integration of the plasmid was verified by PCR. The strain was kept as LKH280 (Fig. 2). Next we tested whether a pyrG mutant could be established in L. lactis without an additional mutation in cdd. The wild type strain MG1363 was transformed with pSH106, and erythromycin-resistant colonies were readily obtained. Again all transformants were shown to have a cytidine requirement, thus showing that the pyrG mutation could be established inL. lactis even in the presence of a wild type cddgene. The mutated pyrG region was verified by PCR on chromosomal DNA extracted from the strain. Based on the observations made in E. coli (33Weng M. Makaroff C.A. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5568-5574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Beck C.F. Ingraham J.L. Neuhard J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 115: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we speculated that such mutants would require a high external cytidine concentration to avoid cytidine depletion due to the deamination to uridine. Hence, mutants were isolated using a cytidine concentration of 50 μg ml−1but were later proved able to grow even at a cytidine concentration of 20 μg ml−1. One of these mutants was kept as LKH278 (Fig. 2). In E. coli it has only been possible to isolate a mutant defective in pyrG if the strain also contained acdd mutation. This difference could be explained if the activity of cytidine deaminase varies between the two bacterial genera. Without added cytidine, the levels of cytidine deaminase are of the same order of magnitude in the two genera (9Martinussen J. Andersen P.S. Hammer K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1514-1516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the presence of cytidine in the medium induces the expression of cdd 30-fold in E. coli (36Hammer-Jespersen K. Munch-Petersen A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 126: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and ensures a very rapid degradation of cytidine in this organism. In fact, cytidine is the effector for the CytR repressor in E. coli (37Hammer-Jespersen K. Munch-Petersen A. Metabolism of Nucleotides, Nucle"

Here we show that whereas Ras-GRF1 activated both Ha-Ras and R-Ras in cells, Ras-GRF2 activated only Ha-Ras. The inability of Ras-GRF2 to activate R-Ras was the consequence of the GTPase being post-translationally modified, since Ras-GRF2 activated unprocessed R-Ras as effectively as unprocessed Ha-Ras when assays were performed either in vivo orin vitro. Moreover, Ras-GRF2 failed to activate fully processed R-Ras in vitro. The particular C-terminal lipid attached to the GTPases played an important role in determining signaling specificity, since R-Ras became more responsive to Ras-GRF2 when it was farnesylated instead of geranylgeranylated. Similarly, Ha-Ras became less responsive to Ras-GRF2 when it was geranylgeranylated instead of farnesylated. Analysis of chimeras between Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 demonstrated that a 30-amino acid segment embedded with their catalytic domains was responsible for recognizing the presence of different lipids on Ras proteins.

These results indicate that the specific lipid moiety attached to GTPases can contribute to signaling specificity of Ras-GEFs. farnesyl geranylgeranyl guanine nucleotide exchange factor glutathione S-transferase The Ras superfamily of GTPases are molecular switches that cycle between the active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). They couple extracellular signals to a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways. The superfamily has been divided into a number of subfamilies including, Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran. The Ras subfamily, the subject of this study, contains the Ras, TC21, R-Ras, M-Ras, Rap, Ral, Rheb, Rin, and Rit proteins. Each of the proteins of the Ras subfamily is post-translationally processed by the addition of either farnesyl (F)1 or geranylgeranyl (GG) lipid moieties, which function to anchor the proteins in cellular membranes. All Ras superfamily proteins become activated upon binding guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which promote the release of bound GDP, allowing activating GTP to take its place. GEFs for Ras subfamily GTPases have similar catalytic domains, which are homologous to the first Ras-GEF identified, yeast CDC25 (2Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 306-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, individual GEFs can differ in their ability to activate particular Ras subfamily members and to be activated by distinct extracellular signals. For example, the ubiquitous SOS1 and SOS2 Ras-GEFs become active in cells in response to signals that generate tyrosine phosphorylation at the interior of the cell surface. This signal promotes the targeting of SOS to its substrate Ras via complex formation between adaptor-bound SOS and cell surface components. Ras-GRP (3Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L.

Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) may activate Ras in response to cAMP and cGMP. Finally, Ras-GRF1 (5Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and Ras-GRF2 (6Fam N.P. Fan W.-T. Wang Z. Zhang L.-J. Chen Z. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell.

GRF1 may also become activated upon G protein-coupled receptor activation (7Shou C. Wurmser A. Suen K.L. Barbacid M. Feig L.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1887-1893PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mattingly R.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29788-29793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Until recently, it appeared that CDC25 family GEFs were specific for individual Ras family members. For example, SOS was found to activate only Ras, while Ral-GDS was found to activate only Ral-GTPases. However, newer studies have shown that this is not always the case. For example, C3G can activate both Rap and R-Ras, and Ras-GRF1 can activate Ras and R-Ras (10Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this study, we compared the GEF specificity of Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2. We found that while Ras-GRF1 can activate both Ha-Ras and R-Ras in cells, Ras-GRF2 can only activate the former in cells. Surprisingly, we found that the failure of Ras-GRF2 to activate R-Ras was due to the geranylgeranyl group present on R-Ras. COS7 cells and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 10% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum (Hyclone). 293T cells were plated at a density 5 × 105 cells per 60-mm diameter plate 1 day before transfection. Each plasmid DNA was introduced into 293 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (11Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S.D. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were plated at a similar concentration, and DNA was introduced into the cells by DEAE-dextran method (10Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). GST-Ha-Ras and GST-R-Ras expression plasmids pEBG-Ha-Ras, pEBG-R-Ras, pEBG-Ha-Ras-SAAX, and pEBG-R-Ras-SAAX were described previously (10Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). pEBG-R-Ras-F, pEBG Ha-Ras-G were constructed by polymerase chain reaction using a 3′ primer that introduced a single amino acid substitution of Ser to Leu for Ha-Ras and Leu to Ser for R-Ras. Both were cloned into the pEBG-vector described above. The catalytic domain of RasGRF2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the full-length clone (kindly provided by Dr. Moran) and inserted into the BamHI andNotI sites of pGEX-4T-1. Each GRF1 and GRF2 chimera and point mutant was constructed by overlap polymerase chain reaction (12Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar). These chimeras and point mutants were inserted into theNotI/KpnI sites of pMT3 (13Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 16: 810-816Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The sequence of all the amplified fragments described were confirmed after subcloning into pBluescript. GST fusions with Ha-Ras, R-Ras, Ras-GRF1, and Ras-GRF2 protein were purified fromEscherichia coli with glutathione beads for in vitro experiment. The nucleotide exchange reaction was carried out as described previously (14Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of a reaction buffer containing 2.0 pmol of each GTPase previously bound to [3H]GDP, an appropriate amount of Ras-GRF, and an excess amount of nonradioactive GTP were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The activities of exchange factors were measured as a decrease in the amount [3H]GDP bound to GTPase, as quantified after filtration through nitrocellulose. To generate processed Ras proteins for exchange assays in vitro, GST-Ha-Ras, GST-Ha-Ras-SAAX, GST-R-Ras, and GST-R-Ras-SAAX in pEBG mammalian expression vectors were transfected into COS7 cells. Cells were lysed with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, with 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h and washed with lysis buffer. Aliquots of these beads were preloaded with [3H]GDP as described above. These beads were then incubated with an appropriate amount of GRF and an excess amount of nonradioactive GTP at 30 °C for 20 min. After incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer several times, and radioactivity associated with the beads was quantified. Measurement of GEF activity in vivo were described previously (14Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS7 cells were transfected with expression vectors containing GST-GTPases and GEFs. The next day, cells were labeled for 4 h in phosphate and serum-free media with 0.05 mCi/ml of32PO4. GST-fused GTPases were collected by incubation of cell lysates with glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h and washed with lysis buffer. GTPase-bound 32P-labeled guanine nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography (Aldrich) and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Calcium stimulation by incubation of 293 cells with ionomycin was also described previously (11Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S.D. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 are highly similar GEFs. Both proteins have been shown to activate Ha-Ras in cells. Because Ras-GRF1 has also been shown to activate R-Ras in cells, we tested Ras-GRF2 for this activity. GST-R-Ras or GST-Ha-Ras was transfected into COS7 cells alone or together with Ras-GRF2. Two days later, cells were exposed to32PO4 to metabolically label guanine nucleotide pools. Transfected GTPases were then isolated on glutathione-agarose beads, and the ratio of labeled GTP to GDP bound to each GTPase was quantified. As described previously, the transfection of Ras-GRF1 increased the proportion of both GTP-bound Ha-Ras and GTP-bound R-Ras (Ha-Ras- from ∼4 to ∼12% GTP, R-Ras from ∼15 to ∼27% (Fig.1A). In contrast, transfection of Ras-GRF2 increased the proportion of GTP-Ha-Ras from ∼4% to ∼16% but had no detectable effect on the proportion of GTP-R-Ras (Fig. 1B). The nucleotide exchange activities of both Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 in cells are enhanced by elevated calcium levels. Treatment of cells with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, increased the ability of both Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 to activate Ha-Ras (Fig. 1C,left). However, calcium enhanced the ability of Ras-GRF1, but not Ras-GRF2, to increase the proportion of R-Ras bound to GTP in cells (Fig. 1C, right). These findings show that the GEF activity of Ras-GRF2 is more restricted than Ras-GRF1, in that the former can activate Ha-Ras but not R-Ras in cells. To begin to understand the basis for the signaling specificity differences observed between the two Ras-GRF family members, the catalytic activity of these proteins was tested in vitro. Both Ras-GRFs contain similar overall domain structure (see Fig. 6A). In particular, they contain pleckstrin homology domains in the N terminus followed by a coiled coil and then a calmodulin-binding IQ domain. Following this is a Rac-activating Dbl domain and finally a CDC25 domain responsible for activating Ras subfamily GTPases. To test catalytic activity in vitro, the C-terminal amino acids of Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2, containing the catalytic CDC25 domains, were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and tested against E. coliproduced R-Ras or Ha-Ras. The GTPases were prelabeled with [3H]GDP, and the rate of exchange with cold GTP was assessed as a function of added GEF concentration. As expected, Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 displayed similar nucleotide exchange activities against Ha-Ras (data not shown). Surprisingly, however, Ras-GRF2 was almost as effective as Ras-GRF1 in promoting nucleotide exchange on unprocessed R-Ras in this assay system (Fig. 2). These findings show that despite their clear differences when assayed in cells, the two Ras-GRFs have a similar potential to promote guanine nucleotide exchange on unprocessed Ras family GTPases.Figure 2Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 promote nucleotide exchange on R-Ras isolated from E. coli. Bacterially produced R-Ras was preloaded with [3H]GDP and then exposed to unlabeled GTP in the presence of either control buffer or buffer containing the catalytic domain of either Ras-GRF1 or Ras-GRF2. The fraction of [3H]GDP remaining bound to R-Ras was assessed as a function of added GEF. The data are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm these findings using full-length GEFs, Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 were transfected into COS cells as described in the legend to Fig. 1, except that mutant Ha-Ras and R-Ras proteins that could not be post-translationally modified in cells because of mutations in their CAAX boxes (where A indicates an alipathic amino acid) were co-transfected. Fig. 3shows that Ras-GRF2 was as efficient as Ras-GRF1 in promoting the GTP-bound state of unprocessed R-Ras. As expected both Ras-GRFs also promoted the GTP-bound state of unprocessed Ha-Ras. Thus, Ras proteins must be post-translationally modified for the differences between Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 to be observed. Post-translational processing at the C terminus of Ras family GTPases involves prenylation followed by proteolytic cleavage of the last three amino acids and then carboxymethylation of the neo-terminal cysteine (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). Ha-Ras and R-Ras differ in that the former is farnesylated, while the latter is geranylgeranylated, at the C terminus. To determine whether this difference is responsible for the differing response of Ha-Ras and R-Ras to Ras-GRF2, the CAAXbox sequences that determine specific prenylation of Ha-Ras and R-Ras were switched. Thus, CVLL in R-Ras was changed to CVLS to promote farnesylation (R-Ras-F) rather than geranylgeranylation, and CVLS in Ha-Ras was changed to CVLL to promote geranylgeranylation (Ha-Ras-G) rather than farnesylation. The altered proteins were then testedin vivo for responsiveness to Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 as described in Fig. 1. Ras-GRF1 maintained the ability to activate R-Ras-F and Ha-Ras-G, consistent with its ability to activate both processed Ha-Ras and R-Ras (Fig. 4). Strikingly, Ras-GRF2 was able to activate R-Ras-F, and it displayed reduced activity against Ha-Ras-G. The fact that geranylgeranylation of Ha-Ras did not completely block Ras-GRF2 activity suggests that there may be other determinants in the R-Ras sequence that contribute to its lack of responsiveness. Nevertheless, these findings indicate that the specific lipid moiety on R-Ras determines to a large part its responsiveness to Ras-GRF2. In particular, geranylgeranylation suppresses Ras-GRF2 activity. Geranylgeranylation of Ras proteins could contribute to signaling specificity by targeting the GTPases to a location in the cell that is accessible to Ras-GRF1 but inaccessible to Ras-GRF2. Alternatively, the existence of the lipid on the GTPase could block the catalytic activity Ras-GRF2, but not Ras-GRF1 independent of the protein's cellular localization. To distinguish between these models, processed R-Ras was used for in vitro GEFs assays. To generate processed R-Ras, a GST/R-Ras fusion construct was transfected into COS7 cells. The expressed protein was extracted from cells with Triton X-100, isolated on glutathione beads, and then used in nucleotide exchange assays with recombinant catalytic domains of Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 (Fig. 5). As a control, a GST/R-Ras SAAX box mutant that does not get processed in cells was also used. Fig. 5A shows that Ras-GRF2 promoted nucleotide exchange on unprocessed but not processed R-Ras. As expected Ras-GRF1 promoted nucleotide exchange on both processed and unprocessed R-Ras (Fig. 5B). Thus, differences in cellular localization between R-Ras and Ha-Ras cannot account for specificity differences observed. Rather, the presence of a geranylgeranyl group on R-Ras blocks the exchange activity of Ras-GRF2 but not Ras-GRF1. To identify the segment of Ras-GRF2 that prevents the protein from activating geranylgeranylated GTPases, chimeras were produced between Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2. The recombinant proteins were then tested in vivo for GEF activity on Ha-Ras or R-Ras as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The first set of chimeras were formed by fusing GRF1 and GRF2 at the beginning of the CDC25 domain. Thus, chimera A contained the first 933 amino acids of GRF1 (containing the PH, IQ, and DH domains) and the final 291 amino acids of GRF2 (containing the entire CDC25 domain). Chimera B was formed at the same site, but it had opposite contributions from GRF1 and GRF2 (Fig. 6,A and B). Chimera A lost the ability to activate R-Ras in vivo, while chimera B retained it (Fig.6C). Both chimeras retained the ability to activate Ha-Ras (Fig. 6D). This meant that the key sequences necessary for R-Ras activation resided in the CDC25 domain. The next set of chimeras were formed deeper within the CDC25 domain. Chimera C contained the first 1082 amino acids of GRF1 and the final 162 amino acids of GRF2. Chimera D was formed at the same site but had the opposite contributions from GRF1 and GRF2. Chimera C retained the ability to activate R-Ras, while chimera D lost it. This meant that the key residues responsible for the specificity difference resided between amino acids 933 and 1082 within the catalytic domain. To further refine this analysis an additional set of chimeric proteins were constructed where this region was dissected and these small segments of either GRF1 or GRF2 were inserted into the full-length counterpart sequence (Fig.7A). For example, chimera E contained all GRF1 sequences except the C-terminal half of the segment defined above (amino acids 1051–1080), which were from GRF2. Chimera F was the opposite. It was all GRF2 sequences except amino acids 1051–1080, which were from GRF1. Strikingly, chimera F activated R-Ras and Ha-Ras, like full-length GRF1, whereas chimera E activated Ha-Ras but not R-Ras like GRF2. Thus, merely exchanging amino acids 1051–1080 made GRF1 lose R-Ras activity and GRF2 gain R-Ras activity (Fig.7B). In contrast, swapping the other half of this region as shown in chimeras G and H failed to have this effect. Importantly, all the chimeras retained the ability to activate Ha-Ras (Fig.7C). These results demonstrate that amino acids 1051–1080 are sufficient to encode signaling specificity that distinguishes these two Ras-GEFs. Amino acids 1051–1080 of GRF1 lie within the core catalytic domain of the protein (Fig. 8A) between the second and third of four highly conserved regions found in all CDC25 family GTPases. The structure of one of these GEFs, SOS, has been determined. If Ras-GRFs have a similar structure, then amino acids 1051–1080 of Ras-GRF1 reside within the C-terminal end of α-helix B (where direct contacts are made with target GTPases), a loop, and the N terminus of α-helix C (Fig. 8). When the amino acids in this region of Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 were aligned with this predicted structure, the major amino acid differences between the two proteins were found to be single substitutions of Arg to Gln at position 1055 and Glu to Gln at position 1067 in helix B. In addition, three contiguous differences, RNE to NYA, at positions 1070–1072 constitute most of the loop structure (Fig. 8). To determine which of these segments is more important for retaining Ras-GRF activity against R-Ras in cells, point mutations were introduced at both sites converting GRF1 amino acids to GRF2 amino acids (Fig. 9). A double mutation of Glu to Gln (position 1067) and Arg to Asn (position 1070) completely blocked R-Ras exchange activity of Ras-GRF 1 without significantly altering its Ha-Ras exchange activity. A similar result was obtained with the triple mutation RNE to NYA (1070–1072) in the same region. The Arg to Gln mutation in the α-helix (position 1055) only partially blocked activity against R-Ras activity and did not affect activity against Ha-Ras activity. Thus, the loop segment connecting the predicted α-helixes B and C appears to contribute most of the signaling specificity differences between Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2. This study documents that Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 have different signaling specificity. Whereas Ras-GRF1 can activate both Ha-Ras and R-Ras, Ras-GRF2 can activate only Ha-Ras in cells. Surprisingly, we found that this distinction was not due to differences in intrinsic nucleotide exchange potential, because the two GEFs showed similar GEF specificity as long as the target GTPase was not geranylgeranylated. For example, Ras-GRF2 activated R-Ras as efficiently as Ras-GRF1 when assays were performed in vitro on unprocessed R-Ras orin vivo on a mutant R-Ras that was not post-translationally processed in cells. The exchange activity of Ras-GRF2 on R-Ras was also observed on an R-Ras mutant that was farnesylated rather than geranylgeranylated in cells. Finally, the activity of Ras-GRF2 on Ha-Ras was suppressed when a mutation was introduced that forced it to be geranylgeranylated rather than farnesylated. The presence GG at the C terminus of Ras GTPases could conceivably generate signaling specificity by targeting the GTPase to a place in the cell where Ras-GRF1 but not Ras-GRF2 has access. This model is consistent with the newly appreciated concept of functionally distinct subdomains of the plasma membrane (15Prior I.A. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1603-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this explanation cannot account for our observation, because the specificity differences between Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 could be recapitulated in vitro. When R-Ras was isolated in a processed form from COS7 cells rather than in an unprocessed form from E. coli, Ras-GRF2 could not promote nucleotide exchange on it while Ras-GRF1 could. This led to the conclusion that it is the presence of lipid itself that is recognized differently by Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2. While it is generally assumed that the function of prenyl groups is to anchor GTPases in cell membranes, there is growing evidence that they also contribute to protein-protein interactions. Geranylgeranyl groups on the C terminus of Rho and Rab proteins bind to Rho and Rab GDP dissociation constant proteins (16Olofsson B. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). By shielding the hydrophobic terminus of GTPases, GDP dissociation constants can transport Rho and Rab proteins from one membrane to another through the aqueous cytoplasm. Moreover, the farnesyl group at the C terminus of Ha-Ras is thought to contribute to activation of adenylate cyclase in yeast (17Shima F. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Yanagihara C. Tamada M. Okada T. Kariya K. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It also promotes Raf binding in mammalian cells through an interaction with a distinct cysteine-rich region of the kinase (18Williams J.G. Drugan J.K. Yi G.S. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22172-22179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An interaction between the farnesyl group on K-Ras and tubulin has also been documented (19Chen Z. Otto J.C. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41251-41257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In all of these cases, however, the lipid enhanced protein-protein interactions, while we have found that it inhibits Ras-GRF2 interactions with GTPases. To gain a better understanding of how Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 interact differently with geranylgeranylated GTPases, we mapped the region in the GEFs responsible for this difference by a combination of chimera production and amino acid substitutions. We found that exchanging a 30-amino acid region within the core catalytic domains of the GEFs was sufficient to confer GG sensitivity to Ras-GRF1 or remove GG sensitivity from Ras-GRF2. The structure of Ras-GRFs is not known. However, it is likely that the catalytic domains of Ras-GRFs are similar to SOS whose crystal structure has recently been solved (20Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). If so, the core catalytic domains of Ras-GRFs are made up of a series of eleven α-helices (A through K). The specificity region we have mapped would then reside within the C terminus of α-helix B, followed by a loop, and then the beginning of α-helix C (see Fig. 8). This region contains a cluster of amino acids at the beginning of α-helix B that are predicted to form direct contacts with its target GTPase (see starred amino acids in Fig. 8). Although these sequences are likely important for high affinity binding between the two proteins, they do not directly participate in nucleotide exchange process. This is thought to occur through the opening of the nucleotide-binding site of GTPases by the insertion of the hairpin between α-helices H and I of GEFs. Our point mutation analysis showed that the amino acids most important for specificity differences between Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 are in a putative loop structure distal to the site in α-helix B that directly contacts the GTPase. Thus, we suspect that the presence of a geranylgeranyl group on a GTPase is detected by the loop region of the GEF and that this region affects GEF/GTPase binding indirectly by influencing the neighboring upstream amino acids responsible for directly binding the GTPase. Interestingly, the loop between the α-helices B and C in Ras-GRF1 contains mostly charged amino acids (E..RNE), while the loop in Ras-GRF2 contains more hydrophobic amino acids (Q..NYA) (see Fig. 8). This difference raised the possibility that this hydrophobic segment in Ras-GRF2 binds the geranylgeranyl group leading to inhibition of Ras-GRF2 activity. However, upon co-transfection into cells, we have not been able to detect binding between Ras-GRF2 and R-Ras or detect GDP-dissociation constant-like activity of Ras-GRF2 (data not shown). We also attempted to directly document geranylgeranyl binding to GRF2 with an analogue of the processed C terminus of R-Ras. The prenylcysteine analogue,N-acetyl-S-all-trans-geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine has been shown to compete with processed Rho proteins for binding to putative membrane anchoring proteins (21Desrosiers R.R. Gauthier F. Lanthier J. Beliveau R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14949-14957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether this GG analogue could block Ras-GRF2 activation of unprocessed R-Ras as an indication of direct binding of the lipid to Ras-GRF2. However, we could not detect any effect that was specific for Ras-GRF2 at concentrations found previously to elute Rho proteins from cell membranes. 2T. Gotoh, X. Tian, and L. A. Feig, unpublished observation. Overall these results suggest that GG does not bind directly to Ras-GRF2. Instead GG may affect Ras-GRF2 activity indirectly by altering the conformation of the GTPase such that it fails to interact productively with the GEF. A study of the interaction of the processed C terminus of Ras with Raf also led to a similar model of prenyl group action (22Rubio I. Wittig U. Meyer C. Heinze R. Kadereit D. Waldmann H. Downward J. Wetzker R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 are found primarily in neurons with highest expression in fully mature animals. That Ras-GRFs are activated by calcium/calmodulin suggests that these GEFs play an important role in regulating multiple differentiated functions of neurons that are regulated by calcium fluxes. Ras and R-Ras are closely related GTPases with identical “effector” domains, which allow them to bind to the same set of downstream target proteins when the GTPases are activated by GEFs. For example both proteins can activate PI3 kinase (23Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, for reasons that are not yet clear, Ras but not R-Ras, can also activate Raf kinases and Ral-GEFs. Moreover, R-Ras promotes inside/out integrin signaling, while Ras can either activate or suppress it (24Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 25Sethi T. Ginsberg M.H. Downward J. Hughes P.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Kinashi T. Katagiri K. Watanabe S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Downward J. Takatsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22590-22596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An understanding of how Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 display selectivity in activation of their target GTPases will be an important component in revealing distinct neuronal functions for these related Ras-GEFs. The experiments described here document that a significant aspect of this signaling specificity derives from the prenylation state of the GTPase targets of these GEFs."
https://openalex.org/W2315357350,"Transcription factors belonging to the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) family are critical regulators of cellular proliferation and differentiation. The functional activity of these proteins can be regulated by heterodimerization through the HLH domain, as a result of formation of functional or non-functional heterodimers. The presence of a leucine zipper in bHLH-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) proteins, however, prevents such heterodimeric interactions via the HLH domain between bHLH and bHLHZip proteins. To identify cellular proteins that directly interact with and modulate transcriptional repression mediated by the bHLH protein Stra13, we carried out a yeast two hybrid screen. The bHLHZip protein USF (Upstream Stimulatory factor) was identified as a Stra13 interacting protein. We demonstrate a direct interaction between Stra13 and USF that is dependent upon the C-terminal repression domain of Stra13 and the DNA-binding domain of USF. Stra13 and USF also colocalize and functionally interact in mammalian cells. Co-expression of USF abrogates Stra13-mediated repression of target genes and conversely, Stra13 inhibits DNA-binding and USF-mediated transactivation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Stra13 and USF interact physically and functionally, and identify a novel mode of cross regulatory interaction between members of the bHLH and bHLHZip families that abrogates their functional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2315556381,"To analyse FHIT transcription patterns in cervical cancer, a series of primary cervical tumors and normal control samples were studied using RT-PCR. Full length and truncated FHIT transcripts were detectable in all samples tested. Interestingly, the expression of truncated FHIT transcripts by primary epithelial cells in vitro was associated with confluency. The breakpoints of most transcript deletions coincided with genuine splice site sequences, suggesting that they resulted from alternative splicing. These findings demonstrate that truncated FHIT transcripts are commonly detected in both normal and tumor tissues, and suggest that these altered transcripts are not causally related to tumorigenesis in cervical cancer."
