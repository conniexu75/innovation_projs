The extreme sensitivity of tubulin to calcium ions explains the failure of previous efforts to obtain polymerization and suggests a possible mechanism for regulation of microtubule polymerization in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1532356406,"Abstract Superoxide dismutase catalyzes the decay of O2-, generated by pulse radiolysis. The enzymatic reaction was first order with respect to enzyme and to O2- and the rate constant, which was 2.3 x 109 m-1 s-1 at pH 7.0 and 20–25°, was not much affected by pH, in the range 4.8 → 9.5. Boiling the enzyme or reversibly removing its copper prosthetic group caused loss of catalytic activity. EDTA had no effect on the enzyme-catalyzed dismutation of superoxide radicals, but did eliminate catalysis by Cu++."
https://openalex.org/W1594796409,"A protease was purified from the culture filtrate of Staphylococcus aureus, strain V8, by a combination of procedures, such as precipitations with ammonium sulfate and acetone, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, and preparative electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. The preparation is homogeneous by disc electrophoresis and sedimentation in the ultracentrifuge. Sedimentation velocity yields a value of s20, w0 = 2.9 S. The molecular weight of the protease is estimated to be 12,000 by sedimentation equilibrium studies, and 11,400 by acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amino acid composition indicates 115 residues, and the absence of sulfhydryl groups. Valine is the NH2-terminal amino acid of the enzyme. The protease is active in the pH range of 3.5 to 9.5 and exhibits maximum proteolytic activity at pH 4.0 and 7.8. It is inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate but not by EDTA. Studies on the substrate specificity with ribonuclease as the substrate revealed that the staphylococcal protease specifically cleaves peptide bonds on the COOH-terminal side of either aspartic acid or glutamic acid. Casein, in which all carboxyl groups had been blocked with glycine ethyl ester in amide linkage, is not hydrolyzed by the protease."

Because the potentiation occurs in hypophysectomized mice, as well as in normal mice, the phenomenon is independent of the release of thyroid stimulating hormone from the pituitary.

https://openalex.org/W1526313338,"Abstract Proinsulin C-peptides were isolated from the pancreas of the green monkey, sheep, and dog by established procedures. The amino acid sequences of these peptides have been determined using a semi-micro adaptation of the Edman degradation procedure. These sequences are compared with those of the human, bovine, porcine, and rat C-peptides. The bovine and ovine C-peptide sequences are identical, whereas the dog sequence appears to contain an 8 residue deletion near the NH2 terminus. Although the C-peptide sequences vary much more than the insulin A and B chain sequences among these species, several prominent features of the C-peptide structure have been conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1967033762,"Animals were orally immunized with horseradish peroxidase and bovine serum albumin, and absorption of these antigens was studied. In comparison with controls, a consistent and significant decrease in peroxidase uptake was noted in both germ-free and conventional rats immunized with peroxidase; a similar decrease in serum albumin uptake was also noted in animals immunized with serum albumin. There was no difference in the uptake of an unrelated macromolecule. These observations suggest that local immunization interferes specifically with the intestinal uptake of macromolecular antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2053860818,"The metabolic behavior of pure mono-, di-, tetra-, and hexachlorobiphenyl isomers in pigeons, rats, and brook trout was investigated. Excreta from these animals were extracted and examined by chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques. The results showed conversion of the 4-chloro-, 4,4'-dichloro-, and 2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl isomers into monohydroxylated derivatives by the rat and pigeon whereas no hydroxymetabolites were detected in the excreta of the brook trout. No hydroxylated products of 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl were detected in the excreta of pigeons, rats, or brook trout."
https://openalex.org/W1558857728,"The double isotope technique of Arias, Doyle, and Schimke ((1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 3303) with radioactive leucine as precursor has been modified to yield accurate values for rate constants of protein degradation. The advantages of the method are that it is both rapid and reproducible in that the protein whose half-life is being measured is isolated only once from one experimental organism and that the values obtained for the rate constants of degradation are comparable to those measured with [guanidino-14C]arginine, and that unlike the latter precursor, radioactive leucine is extensively incorporated into liver protein. The turnover of the population of total soluble proteins and six proteins isolated in homogeneous form from rat liver was studied by means of the double isotope method. The majority of liver proteins are degraded with half-lives between 2 and 8 days. There is a general correlation between subunit size and rate of degradation. The subunits of the multimeric proteins δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase, catalase, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase are degraded at the same rate as the protein in its quaternary configuration. No intermediate states in the degradation of the subunits were found in the biologically active proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1989482705,"Radioimmunoassayable prolactin rises in postpartum women during nursing and after intravenous thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Prolactin release induced by TRH can be dissociated from the postsuckling response. In addition to this, increases in endogenous prolactin secretion are followed by marked breast engorgement and milk letdown, especially after intravenous TRH. In this group of breast-feeding women, vaginal smears remained atrophic even up to 410 postpartum days. Prolactin appears to influence the production of breast milk, and the maintenance of a regular nursing pattern seems to promote the maintenance of ovarian unresponsiveness to circulating gonadotropins."

https://openalex.org/W1578073842,"Abstract A variety of techniques have been employed to investigate the penicillin-binding components of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Virtually all the binding sites in these organisms are located in the cell membrane. All the techniques which have been employed suggest that more than one binding component exists in each of these organisms, although S. aureus and E. coli both appear to have only a single major one. A particularly interesting observation was that in Bacillus subtilis one of the two major components which reacts with penicillin G does not react readily with cephalothin."

In the trained, performing animal, single cells are more responsive than in the animal that is trained but not performing in the task. In the naive monkey, evoked responses are labile and are maintained only with nonrepetitive auditory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2092151089,"Parenteral alimentation solutions free of cysteine, probably an essential amino acid for premature infants, were administered continuously to eight healthy men through catheters in the superior vena cava and through nasogastric tubes. When the preparation was administered parenterally, the plasma cystine concentration dropped markedly. When feeding was switched to the oral route, the concentration rose immediately, but returned to baseline only when a cystine-containing diet was fed. These studies indicate that the synthesis of cysteine from methionine is limited, even in the adult subject, when cystine-free diets are administered parenterally."
https://openalex.org/W1505848918,"Abstract Tryptophan oxygenase has been purified from livers of glucocorticoid and l-tryptophan-treated rats. Homogeneity of the enzyme was established by polyacrylamide electrophoresis, sedimentation experiments, and immunodiffusion. Amino acid analyses reveal 6 residues of cysteine per enzyme molecule. Analyses for heme content indicate 2 moles of heme per mole of enzyme. The sedimentation coefficient of the enzyme is 7.36 S. High speed equilibrium sedimentation experiments yield a molecular weight of 167,000. The optical spectra of the ferrienzyme as well as of the chemically reduced enzyme in the presence and absence of l-tryptophan are shown. The subunit structure of the enzyme was investigated by equilibrium sedimentation and electrophoresis at pH ≥12 and by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate at pH 7.0. These studies indicate that hepatic tryptophan oxygenase is a tetramer composed of two pairs of identical subunits of equivalent mass (α2β2), the quaternary structure of which is stabilized exclusively by noncovalent interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1553140860,"The magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) induced in the visible absorption bands of Co(II) carbonic anhydrase by a 45 kilogauss magnetic field is described. Based on a comparison to the absorption and MCD spectra of Co(II) in tetrahedral, distorted tetrahedral, and octahedral ligand fields, band assignments are made for both the active alkaline form of the Co(II) enzyme and its anion complexes. The MCD shows that all anion complexes appear to have similar if not identical molecular geometry around the cobalt ion which generates a nearly tetrahedral ligand field. It is proposed that the active alkaline form of the Co(II) enzyme is a trigonally distorted tetrahedron. The relationship of these coordination geometries to the mechanism of action is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1602176215,"Abstract The galactose-binding protein was isolated and purified from a mutant, EH3039, defective in the β-methylgalactoside transport system. The purification consisted of cold osmotic shock, ammonium sulfate precipitation, electrofocusing, Sephadex G-100 chromatography, preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and chromatography through Bio-Gel P-150. The mutant protein cross-reacts with antibodies against wild type galactose-binding protein and exhibits identical molecular weight as measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Peptide mapping of the tryptic digests shows that the mutant binding protein has changed pattern in comparison with the wild type protein, demonstrating a change in the polypeptide chain of the protein upon mutation of the wild type. The protein possesses binding affinity for d-galactose with a dissociation constant higher than 0.1 mm. The conformational change observed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the wild type binding protein upon binding of d-galactose does not occur with the mutant protein. However, it does show an increase in fluorescence at 336 nm (excitation 290 nm) in the presence of high concentrations of d-galactose, as does the wild type. The half-maximal increase of fluorescence occurs at 3.4 mm d-galactose, in contrast to the wild type value of 1 µm. d-Glucose and d-glyceryl-1-β-d-galactoside, which are active with wild type binding protein, also give rise to fluorescence increase in the mutant protein at concentrations higher than 1 mm. The mutant strain, EH3039, has been reverted to a transport-positive phenotype. The galactose-binding protein of this revertant was also purified and shown to exhibit properties characteristic for the wild type protein: binding towards galactose has a Kdiss of 0.2 µm; binding of substrate induces a conformational change resulting in an increase of electrophoretic mobility of the protein at pH 8.3; binding of substrate also increases the tryptophan fluorescence of the protein at a half-maximal substrate concentration of 1 µm. The simultaneous alteration in the structure and activity of the galactose-binding protein upon mutation of a wild type strain (W3092cy-) to a transport-negative mutant (EH3039) and its reversion to a transport-positive strain (LA39) clearly demonstrates the essential role of the galactose-binding protein in the function of the β-methylgalactoside transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1591269025,"Abstract The repair of thymine dimers induced by irradiation with ultraviolet light was detected in the DNA of human fibroblast cells, HeLa, but not in the DNA of rat glial or rat pituitary cells. Thymine dimers were detected in the DNA of bacterial and mammalian cells after irradiation with levels of light which are biologically significant, as little as 50 ergs per mm2. The detection of thymine dimers involves the use of specific antibodies to these photoproducts in a radioimmunoassay that can be performed directly on the DNA extracted from the cells. The validity of the assay in the study of repair processes in mammalian cells was first established in a well defined bacterial system. The appearance and excision of thymine dimers in DNA of Bacillus subtilis 101 (an ultraviolet-resistant strain) and B. subtilis 124 (an ultraviolet-sensitive strain which lacks the ability to excise the photoproducts after ultraviolet irradiation) was estimated serologically and was correlated with the transforming activities of the DNA extracted from the cells after irradiation and after a recovery period."
https://openalex.org/W974572515,"In the early stage of the reaction of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, a new spectral species of the enzyme having a broad absorption band with a maximum between 500 and 520 nm was observed by using a stopped flow technique. The observed spectrum was distinct from those of the enzyme or the enzyme-protoacatechuic acid complex and its formation was absolutely dependent on the simultaneous presence of both oxygen and substrate, protoacatechuic acid. The rate constant for the decomposition of the new spectral species determined by stopped flow experiments was in good agreement with the turnover number of the enzyme determined from the over-all reaction. A similar spectral species was also observed during the steady state of the reaction when enzymatically active substrate analogues such as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid were used. The rate constants for the decomposition of the new spectral species were also in accord with their turnover numbers of the enzyme. Further analysis of the detailed kinetics with these substrate analogues revealed that the rates of the over-all reaction at different time intervals were proportional to the amount of the intermediate present and the integrated amounts of the intermediate during the entire course of the reaction were also proportional to the initial concentrations of oxygen. These results indicate that the new spectral species is a ternary complex of oxygen, substrate, and enzyme, and its degradation is the rate-limiting step of the over-all reaction. The rate constants for the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex and of the ternary complex were also determined with substrate analogues. Kinetic parameters calculated from rate constants were also in good agreement with those obtained from the over-all reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1563269631,"Abstract α-Ketoglutarate synthase from the photosynthetic bacterium Chlorobium thiosulfatophilum, an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of α-ketoglutarate by a reductive carboxylation of succinyl-CoA, was purified about 120-fold by high speed centrifugation, fractionation with protamine sulfate, column chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, and sedimentation in a sucrose gradient. α-Ketoglutarate synthase is readily inactivated by oxygen; strictly anaerobic conditions are essential for preserving enzyme activity during purification, handling, and storage. The reductive synthesis of α-ketoglutarate from succinyl-CoA and bicarbonate requires reduced ferredoxin. Of several ferredoxins tested, only those from the photosynthetic bacteria C. thiosulfatophilum, Chromatium, and Rhodospirillum rubrum were effective. The ferredoxins of Clostridium pasteurianum and spinach were found to be poor substitutes for those of photosynthetic bacteria. The reversibility of the α-ketoglutarate synthase reaction was demonstrated by the use of α-ketoglutarate, CoA, and one of several electron acceptors in substrate amounts: FAD, FMN, triphenyltetrazolium chloride, or ferredoxin. NAD and NADP were ineffective. Purified preparations of α-ketoglutarate synthase show, in the presence of either CoA or reduced ferredoxin, an active 14C exchange between [14C]bicarbonate and α-ketoglutarate. α-Ketoglutarate synthase was found to be distinct from pyruvate synthase with respect to molecular size and chromatographic properties. The molecular weights and sedimentation coefficients of α-ketoglutarate synthase and pyruvate synthase were found to be, respectively, 220,000 and 9.0 S and 300,000 and 10.7 S."
https://openalex.org/W1495358285,"Abstract Fibroblasts from patients with the syndrome are deficient in a specific protein, designated Hunter corrective factor, which is required for the degradation of sulfated mucopolysaccharide. This factor has now been purified 120-fold from normal human urine by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, gel chromatography on Sephadex G-200, passage through anti-albumin Sepharose to remove albumin, a major contaminant, and finally, preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The last procedure separates two isofactors, which are probably charge isomers; both differ in charge from the factor derived from fibroblast secretions. The molecular weight of urinary factor is estimated at 65,000 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 114,000 by gel filtration. The most highly purified preparation of urinary factor shows a single protein component in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8, but can be resolved into several bands by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel. It is free of the common lysosomal glycosidases and sulfatases, as well as of factors effective in other mucopolysaccharidoses (Hurler, Scheie, Sanfilippo A and B, and Maroteaux-Lamy). The corrective factor accelerates the degradation, by fibroblasts, of dermatan sulfate labeled in the sulfate or galactosamine moieties, as well as of exogenously added proteodermatan [35S]sulfate. The effect of the factor persists in the recipient cells with a half-life of 2 days."
https://openalex.org/W1519659655,"Abstract Human galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase was purified approximately 1000-fold from post-mortem liver and from erythrocytes. Studies of pH optimum, Km values for UDP-glucose and galactose 1-phosphate, and the effect of dithiothreitol on enzyme activity gave results that do not differ significantly from those obtained with crude enzyme preparations. Molecular weight determinations by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration showed that the enzyme from individuals homozygous for the wild type, Duarte variant, and galactosemic alleles each have the same molecular size in the range of 90,000. Enzyme purified to homogeneity from the erythrocytes of wild type individuals and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis revealed a single molecular species of about 30,000 suggesting that the functional enzyme may have a trimeric structure. Rabbit antibody to the human enzyme was produced by immunization with transferase purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from liver. Liver and erythrocyte samples tested against the antibody by double immunodiffusion with the Ouchterlony technique gave precipitins of complete identity. Hemoglobin-free erythrocyte extracts from wild type, Duarte variant, and galactosemic individuals gave precipitin bands of complete identity against the antibody. The same antiserum used for double immunodiffusion experiments was found to precipitate quantitatively transferase activity from solution. The antitransferase precipitation curves for equal amounts of liver and erythrocyte transferase activity were similar. Duarte variant erythrocyte transferase, however, required twice as much antiserum for complete precipitation when compared with the wild type enzyme. Since Duarte variant erythrocytes contain half of the transferase activity found in the wild type, this finding suggests that the Duarte molecule is catalytically less efficient than the wild type. Galactosemic erythrocytes were found to contain an antigen that quantitatively absorbs the same antibody that precipitates the wild type enzyme. These observations support the hypothesis that the three alleles at the transferase locus in man code for immunologically identical proteins of similar molecular size. From this it may be concluded that the less active Duarte variant and catalytically inactive galactosemic proteins are the consequence of small structural gene mutations."

https://openalex.org/W1606739086,"Abstract Affinity chromatography has been applied to the problem of specifically removing luteinizing hormone from sera used to supplement tissue culture media. Horse or fetal calf sera, passed through a column of an anti-luteinizing hormone immunoglobulin fraction linked covalently to agarose, were specifically depleted in their content of luteinizing hormone as seen by radioimmunoassay and by their effect on cultures of ovarian cells dependant on luteinizing hormone for their growth. Affinity chromatography has also been applied to the one step isolation of luteinizing hormone from a partially purified or crude extract of ovine pituitary glands. Partially purified extracts or crude extracts of pituitary glands, passed through a column of an anti-luteinizing hormone immunoglobulin fraction linked covalently to agarose, were depleted in their luteinizing hormone content. Elution of the column by 6 m guanidine HCl pH 1.5 resulted in the recovery of the hormone which was further characterized by chemical and biological analysis as well as its electrophoretic pattern. It was demonstrated that affinity chromatography can be used to isolate preparations of highly homogeneous ovine luteinizing hormone in one step."
https://openalex.org/W1545880485,"Abstract A methyl methanesulfonate sensitive mutant of Bacillus subtilis appears to lack the enzyme DNA polymerase I. The absence of polymerase I permits the detection of a second DNA polymerizing enzyme in the mutant. This second polymerase is inhibitable by sulfhydryl antagonists, and shows maximal activity on double-stranded DNA substrates with many single strand breaks. Poly[d(A-T)] is less efficiently used as a substrate, in contrast to the substrate preferences of polymerase I. Compared to the wild type, the mutant is more sensitive to ultraviolet and x-irradiation, and is inefficient in reactivation of ultraviolet-irradiated SP01 bacteriophage, but is normal in genetic recombination."

This partially purified preparation racemizes l-alanine about half as rapidly as it racemizes l-aspartate. With l-glutamate as substrate, it exhibits no racemase activity. In the presence of dithiothreitol, the aspartate racemase is remarkably thermostable at pH 6 and pH 8 to 9, but it is thermolabile at pH 7.5. Other properties of the enzyme are described."
https://openalex.org/W1487971122,"Abstract Human IgG (immunoglobulin G) was chemically modified by citraconic anhydride and the conformational transitions were tested by measuring CD (circular dichroism), hydrodynamic properties, and immunoprecipitation reactions. It was found that mild conversion of the lysine e-amino groups (at pH 7.7 and room temperature) into the negatively charged citraconyl groups caused expansion and loss of the β structure of IgG. The positive CD band at 202 nm became negative, while the weak bands in the near-ultraviolet zone changed only slightly; the intrinsic viscosity increased, the sedimentation coefficient decreased, and the immunoresponse against goat antiserum was lost. The citraconylated IgG was reconverted to native IgG by dialysis against 0.05 m acetate of pH 4.0 for 72 hours. The reversal to the native conformation was achieved also by raising the ionic strength to about 1.1. Carbamylation of 88% of the e-amino groups of IgG did not change the CD spectrum, hydrodynamic properties, or immunoprecipitation reaction. The results indicate that the conformational change on citraconylation was caused by electrostatic repulsion of the introduced carboxylate ions into the macromolecules. Moreover, according to these results the e-amino groups of lysine residues are not essential for the immunoprecipitation reaction, whereas the native rigid conformation of the macromolecules is decisive in this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1588860107,"Abstract A bifunctional enzyme complex consisting of 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthetase and chorismate mutase in strain 168 of Bacillus subtilis has been purified to near homogeneity by conventional purification procedures. A major protein band with two minor components was observed when the final preparation was subjected to gel electrophoresis at pH 9.3 and 7.0. DAHP synthetase and chorismate mutase activity were associated only with the major band. The significant property of the bifunctional enzyme complex is its relationship to shikimate kinase, another enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway. When cell-free preparations are chromatographed on Sephadex G-200, only a trace of shikimate kinase activity is recovered. When the chorismate mutase-DAHP synthetase complex fraction is mixed with fractions which show only traces of shikimate kinase activity, full catalytic activity of shikimate kinase is restored. The activity of the reconstructed shikimate kinase activity resembles the activity observed in crude extracts in several parameters. Single site mutants which lack chorismate mutase activity also lack DAHP synthetase and shikimate kinase activities. The close association of these three enzymes in vitro as well as the isolation of such pleiotrophic mutants strongly suggests that these three enzymes are part of a multi-enzyme complex in vivo. The present data are consistent with the hypothesis that this complex functions as a unit of feedback control."

https://openalex.org/W1598083106,"Abstract The formation of aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid derivatives containing a blocked α-amino group such as the formylmethionyl ester of methionine transfer ribonucleic acid (fMet-tRNAfmet) was studied in Streptococcus faecalis R. This bacterium cannot synthesize folate, and its growth is dependent upon the presence of either added folic acid or a mixture of products of biosynthetic reactions requiring the participation of tetrahydrofolate: serine, methionine, a purine, and thymine. Only extracts prepared from S. faecalis R cells grown on medium containing folic acid catalyzed the formation of an amino acid derivative esterified to tRNA which lacked a free α-amino group; of the amino acids tested, only methionine was a substrate for the formation of such an aminoacyl-tRNA derivative containing a blocked α-amino group. The methionyl-tRNA derivative was identified as N-formylmethionyl-tRNA. Extracts prepared from S. faecalis R cells grown on folate-free medium supplemented with serine, methionine, a purine, and thymine could not catalyze the formation of any detectable aminoacyl-tRNA species containing a modified α-amino group. The in vivo level of charged tRNAmet of exponentially grown S. faecalis R was estimated to be near 100% for both folate-sufficient and folate-deficient grown cells, and the total amount of tRNAfmet was the same under both culture conditions. However, methionyl-tRNAfmet was only formylated in cells grown in the presence of folic acid. Approximately 82 to 85% of the tRNAfmet of S. faecalis R in exponential growth stage in folate-containing medium was blocked to further formylation using 10-[14C]formyltetrahydrofolate as the formyl donor, whereas none of the tRNAfmet prepared from cells grown in the absence of folic acid was blocked to formylation. These results indicate that methionyl-tRNA in S. faecalis R grown in the absence of folic acid but in the presence of the supplements is neither formylated nor contains a blocked α-amino group and provide further evidence that formylation of methionyl-tRNAfmet is not required for the initiation of protein synthesis in S. faecalis R under certain defined conditions of culture."
https://openalex.org/W1495959547,"Abstract The uptake of several dicarboxylic acids by Bacillus subtilis has been surveyed. Gratuitous conditions for induction of l-malate uptake were achieved under which the addition of l-malate to the medium resulted in increased uptake of l-malate by the cells without significantly influencing the growth rate. The specificity of induction of l-malate uptake was investigated using other dicarboxylate anions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Fumarate induced l-malate uptake with about ⅓ the efficiency of l-malate. No induction of l-malate uptake was observed in a succinic dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.1) negative mutant grown in the presence of succinate, although this strain could be fully induced for l-malate uptake by the addition of l-malate to the growth medium. l-Malate uptake in a B. subtilis mutant lacking malic dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) activity appeared constitutive, probably owing to endogenous induction caused by the accumulation of l-malate inside the cells. These data suggested that l-malate was the true inducer of the l-malate transport system, but confirmation of this notion must come from a system in which l-malate is strictly nonmetabolizable. The l-malate transport system could be catabolite repressed by d-glucose. l-Malate uptake followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics; its apparent Km was 0.4 mm and Vmax approached 400 µmoles per min per g dry weight of cells. The system was shown to be highly specific by using competitive inhibitors, of which l(+)citramalate, mesotartrate,3-fluoro-dl-malate, and d(+)-malate were most effective. 2,4-Dinitrophenol, azide, and classical uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation strongly inhibited l-malate uptake in B. subtilis. The l-malate transport system was different from the previously reported citrate uptake system: the two systems could be separately induced. Furthermore, mutants deficient in citrate uptake largely retained the ability to be induced for l-malate uptake. Fumarate uptake in B. subtilis was inducible to fairly high activities but seemed dependent on the continual removal of fumarate via the tricarboxylic acid cycle in order to exhibit maximal uptake rates. The Km for the process was 0.7 mm. Similarly, α-ketoglutarate was transported by an inducible system; the process had a high Km (6.7 mm). We were unable to demonstrate induction of a system for succinate uptake, and saturation kinetics were not observed over the 50-fold concentration range tested (0.1 to 5.0 mm). dl-Tartrate uptake could be strongly inhibited by the addition of l-malate or l(+)tartrate to the medium during growth."
https://openalex.org/W1575327874,"Abstract The purification of the N-acetylmuramic acid l-alanine amidase from Bacillus megaterium KM is described.

The enzyme has a pH optimum of 6.8 and a sharp ionic strength optimum at Γ/2 = 0.02. The enzyme has a 4- to 10-fold higher initial velocity with cell walls obtained from logarithmically growing cells than from cell walls obtained from cells in stationary phase of growth. This difference in hydrolysis rate may account, in part, for the difference in cell wall turnover previously observed between stationary and logarithmic cells."

https://openalex.org/W1568025041,"The incorporation of 14C into CO2 from ten labeled substrates: [1-14C]- and [2-14C]acetate; [1-14C]-, [3,4-14C]-, and [5-14C]glutamate; [1-14C]-, [4-14C]-, and [U-14C]aspartate, [1-14C]- and [U-14C]alanine was measured under steady state conditions in Tetrahymena pyriformis cultures at three different stages of growth. The rate of oxygen consumption and the incorporation of 14C from [1-14C]- and [2-14C]acetate into lipid and glycogen were measured under the same conditions. An isotopic and metabolic steady state model of carbon flow through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the glyoxylate cycle, and the gluconeogenic and lipogenic pathways in Tetrahymena was developed. Fitting of the model to experimental data requires separation of mitochondrial and extramitochondrial pools of aspartate, oxalacetate, malate, and acetyl-CoA, as well as two pools of phosphoenolpyruvate. These structural requirements, necessary to fit the experimental data, were independently justified by information on enzyme compartmentation. By using the data in conjunction with the model quantitative estimates of the flux rates through the major pathways of intermediary metabolism were obtained. The pattern of intracellular flow of metabolites underlying the observed changes in glycogen content and lipid content with culture age are analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W1586187474,"Abstract The presence of arginyl-tRNA protein transferase has been shown in a variety of mammalian cells in culture. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the available endogenous acceptor proteins (proteins that can be arginylated at their amino terminus by this enzyme) reveals that there are at least two such proteins (designated Peaks I and II) with the same relative migration during electrophoresis in a variety of tissues. Analysis of baby hamster kidney cells (BHK), polyoma-transformed BHK, and herpes simplex-infected BHK showed Peak II, but in the general region of Peak I there were two peaks. Other peaks, which varied in migration and appearance, were also observed in the various cell preparations. The incorporation of labeled arginine was inhibited by ribonuclease, canavanine, hemoglobin, and hemin but not by puromycin nor cycloheximide. The specificity of the enzyme from different species for exogenous acceptor proteins of various species is reported."
https://openalex.org/W2054870841,"The conformational requirements for binding of triiodothyronine to thyroxine-binding globulin were investigated with triiodothyronine analogs having restricted rotation at the ether bond. Although it has been reported that the predominant conformation of triiodothyronine carries the 3' iodine in a position proximal to the phenylalanine ring, the analog for the distal, hormonally active orientation of the 3' iodine is more effective in displacing triiodothyronine and thyroxine from thyroxine-binding globulin. The lower binding affinity of thyroxine-binding globulin for triiodothyronine as compared to thyroxine may be explained by specificity of the binding site for the less abundant conformation of triiodothyronine."
https://openalex.org/W1568390826,"Tyrosyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase was purified from two tyrS mutants of Escherichia coli. A comparison of the properties of the mutant and wild type enzymes demonstrated a striking difference in the apparent Km for tyrosine; it had been increased by these mutations several hundred-fold in both the ATP-pyrophosphate exchange and the tRNA acylation reactions. The affinity for the tyrosine analogue, tyramine, was not as drastically affected. There was little or no change in the apparent Km for tRNA in the acylation reaction, in its Ki in ATP-PPi exchange and in the apparent Km for tyrosyl-tRNA in deacylation. The apparent Km for ATP was also probably not altered by these mutations. The change in the Km for tyrosine and the heat lability of the mutationally altered enzymes establish that tyrS is the structural gene for tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. The growth of tyrS mutants that were phenotypically Tyr- was inhibited by phenylalanine. Phenylalanine inhibited the uptake of tyrosine into the cell which prevented protein synthesis in these mutants but not in the wild type strain."
https://openalex.org/W1577662563,"Abstract The d-aspartic acid-activating enzyme of Streptococcus faecalis is found both in the supernatant solution and bound to the membrane. Under the gentlest conditions of lysis, virtually all of the enzyme is on the membrane fraction. When the enzyme is prepared from the supernatant fraction, it has a higher molecular weight than when it is prepared from the membrane, but it can be disaggregated by treatment with salt. Both preparations can be rebound to saltdepleted membranes under certain conditions. Both preparations also contain d-aspartyltransferase activity which can transfer aspartic acid from β-d-aspartyl phosphate (the presumed intermediate) either to a uridine nucleotide acceptor or to a lipid intermediate in peptidoglycan synthesis. The transferase and the activating enzyme have not been separated so far."
