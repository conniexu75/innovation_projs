https://openalex.org/W2051029549,"In a Mott insulator, suppression of conductivity occurs as a result of electron interactions. Proximity to this phase causes intriguing phenomena in fermionic condensed matter systems, most notably high-temperature superconductivity. The Hubbard model, which encompasses the essential physics of the Mott insulator, can be realized with quantum gases trapped in an optical lattice. Therefore, experimental tools developed in atomic physics can be used to study this regime. However, an atomic Mott insulator has so far been realized only with a gas of bosons, which lack the rich and peculiar nature of fermions. The authors report the formation of a Mott insulator of a repulsively interacting two-component Fermi gas in an optical lattice. The results pave the way for further studies of the Mott insulator, including spin-ordering and ultimately the question of d-wave superfluidity. This paper reports the formation of a Mott insulator of a repulsively interacting two-component Fermi gas in an optical lattice. It is identified by three features: a drastic suppression of doubly occupied lattice sites, a strong reduction of the compressibility inferred from the response of double occupancy to an increase in atom number, and the appearance of a gapped mode in the excitation spectrum. The results pave the way for further studies of the Mott insulator, including spin-ordering and ultimately the question of d-wave superfluidity. Strong interactions between electrons in a solid material can lead to surprising properties. A prime example is the Mott insulator, in which suppression of conductivity occurs as a result of interactions rather than a filled Bloch band1. Proximity to the Mott insulating phase in fermionic systems is the origin of many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics2, most notably high-temperature superconductivity3. The Hubbard model4, which encompasses the essential physics of the Mott insulator, also applies to quantum gases trapped in an optical lattice5,6. It is therefore now possible to access this regime with tools developed in atomic physics. However, an atomic Mott insulator has so far been realized only with a gas of bosons7, which lack the rich and peculiar nature of fermions. Here we report the formation of a Mott insulator of a repulsively interacting two-component Fermi gas in an optical lattice. It is identified by three features: a drastic suppression of doubly occupied lattice sites, a strong reduction of the compressibility inferred from the response of double occupancy to an increase in atom number, and the appearance of a gapped mode in the excitation spectrum. Direct control of the interaction strength allows us to compare the Mott insulating regime and the non-interacting regime without changing tunnel-coupling or confinement. Our results pave the way for further studies of the Mott insulator, including spin-ordering and ultimately the question of d-wave superfluidity6,8."

https://openalex.org/W2039150795,"Long-duration γ-ray bursts (GRBs) release copious amounts of energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into the process of black hole formation from the collapse of massive stars. Previous early optical observations of even the most exceptional GRBs (990123 and 030329) lacked both the temporal resolution to probe the optical flash in detail and the accuracy needed to trace the transition from the prompt emission within the outflow to external shocks caused by interaction with the progenitor environment. Here we report observations of the extraordinarily bright prompt optical and γ-ray emission of GRB 080319B that provide diagnostics within seconds of its formation, followed by broadband observations of the afterglow decay that continued for weeks. We show that the prompt emission stems from a single physical region, implying an extremely relativistic outflow that propagates within the narrow inner core of a two-component jet. The γ-ray burst GRB 080319B, the result of the violent collapse of a massive star to form a black hole, is the most luminous optical flash so far observed in the 40-year history of γ-ray astronomy. Discovered by the Swift satellite on 19 March 2008 and briefly visible to the naked eye, it produces energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Now a reanalysis of the extraordinarily bright emissions of GRB 080319B within a few seconds of its formation, together with broadband observations of its decay over the following few weeks, provide the clearest picture yet of one of these events. The data clearly establish that the prompt optical flash was produced in the same physical region as the γ-ray burst itself. The afterglow properties cannot be explained by the standard simple models, but rather imply a multi-component jet interpretation. Long duration γ-ray bursts (GRBs) release copious amounts of energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and provide a window into the process of black hole formation from the collapse of massive stars. Observations of the extraordinarily bright prompt optical and γ-ray emission of GRB 080319B shows that the prompt emission stems from a single physical region, implying an extremely relativistic outflow that propagates within the narrow inner core of a two-component jet."
https://openalex.org/W2083992260,"In bacteria, the intracellular concentration of several amino acids is controlled by riboswitches. One of the important regulatory circuits involves lysine-specific riboswitches, which direct the biosynthesis and transport of lysine and precursors common for lysine and other amino acids. To understand the molecular basis of amino acid recognition by riboswitches, here we present the crystal structure of the 174-nucleotide sensing domain of the Thermotoga maritima lysine riboswitch in the lysine-bound (1.9 ångström (A)) and free (3.1 A) states. The riboswitch features an unusual and intricate architecture, involving three-helical and two-helical bundles connected by a compact five-helical junction and stabilized by various long-range tertiary interactions. Lysine interacts with the junctional core of the riboswitch and is specifically recognized through shape-complementarity within the elongated binding pocket and through several direct and K(+)-mediated hydrogen bonds to its charged ends. Our structural and biochemical studies indicate preformation of the riboswitch scaffold and identify conformational changes associated with the formation of a stable lysine-bound state, which prevents alternative folding of the riboswitch and facilitates formation of downstream regulatory elements. We have also determined several structures of the riboswitch bound to different lysine analogues, including antibiotics, in an effort to understand the ligand-binding capabilities of the lysine riboswitch and understand the nature of antibiotic resistance. Our results provide insights into a mechanism of lysine-riboswitch-dependent gene control at the molecular level, thereby contributing to continuing efforts at exploration of the pharmaceutical and biotechnological potential of riboswitches."
https://openalex.org/W2055018340,"Translation initiation is influenced by input from extracellular stimuli. While two eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) are known to transduce external signals to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, it was not known whether an eIF served a similar function for the large (60S) ribosomal subunit. In this study, Gandin et al. show that eIF6 communicates extracellular signals to the 60S subunit. Cells from an eIF6 heterozygous mouse show normal ribosome assembly but reduced translation, delayed cell cycle progression, and impaired transformation. This work suggests that eIF6 acts an initiation factor, in vivo, and may control growth and tumorigenesis. Although two eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) are known to transmit signals to the small ribosomal subunit, it was unknown whether an eIF served a similar function for the large ribosomal subunit. This study shows that eIF6 communicates extracellular signals to the 60S subunit. Cells from an eIF6 heterozygous mouse show normal ribosome biogenesis but reduced translation, delayed cell cycle progression, and impaired transformation. Cell growth and proliferation require coordinated ribosomal biogenesis and translation. Eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) control translation at the rate-limiting step of initiation1,2. So far, only two eIFs connect extracellular stimuli to global translation rates3: eIF4E acts in the eIF4F complex and regulates binding of capped messenger RNA to 40S subunits, downstream of growth factors4,5, and eIF2 controls loading of the ternary complex on the 40S subunit and is inhibited on stress stimuli6,7. No eIFs have been found to link extracellular stimuli to the activity of the large 60S ribosomal subunit. eIF6 binds 60S ribosomes precluding ribosome joining in vitro8,9,10. However, studies in yeasts showed that eIF6 is required for ribosome biogenesis rather than translation11,12,13,14. Here we show that mammalian eIF6 is required for efficient initiation of translation, in vivo. eIF6 null embryos are lethal at preimplantation. Heterozygous mice have 50% reduction of eIF6 levels in all tissues, and show reduced mass of hepatic and adipose tissues due to a lower number of cells and to impaired G1/S cell cycle progression. eIF6+/- cells retain sufficient nucleolar eIF6 and normal ribosome biogenesis. The liver of eIF6+/- mice displays an increase of 80S in polysomal profiles, indicating a defect in initiation of translation. Consistently, isolated hepatocytes have impaired insulin-stimulated translation. Heterozygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts recapitulate the organism phenotype and have normal ribosome biogenesis, reduced insulin-stimulated translation, and delayed G1/S phase progression. Furthermore, eIF6+/- cells are resistant to oncogene-induced transformation. Thus, eIF6 is the first eIF associated with the large 60S subunit that regulates translation in response to extracellular signals."
https://openalex.org/W1986581714,"Rapidly growing cells produce thousands of new ribosomes each minute, in a tightly regulated process that is essential to cell growth. How the Escherichia coli 16S ribosomal RNA and the 20 proteins that make up the 30S ribosomal subunit can assemble correctly in a few minutes remains a challenging problem, partly because of the lack of real-time data on the earliest stages of assembly. By providing snapshots of individual RNA and protein interactions as they emerge in real time, here we show that 30S assembly nucleates concurrently from different points along the rRNA. Time-resolved hydroxyl radical footprinting was used to map changes in the structure of the rRNA within 20 milliseconds after the addition of total 30S proteins. Helical junctions in each domain fold within 100 ms. In contrast, interactions surrounding the decoding site and between the 5', the central and the 3' domains require 2-200 seconds to form. Unexpectedly, nucleotides contacted by the same protein are protected at different rates, indicating that initial RNA-protein encounter complexes refold during assembly. Although early steps in assembly are linked to intrinsically stable rRNA structure, later steps correspond to regions of induced fit between the proteins and the rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2039931633,"Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are key negative regulators of cell death that are highly expressed in many cancers. Cell death caused by antagonists that bind to IAP proteins is associated with their ubiquitylation and degradation. The RING domain at the C terminus of IAP proteins is pivotal. Here we report the crystal structures of the cIAP2 RING domain homodimer alone, and bound to the ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme UbcH5b. These structures show that small changes in the RING domain accompany E2 binding. By mutating residues at the E2-binding surface, we show that autoubiquitylation is required for regulation of IAP abundance. Dimer formation is also critical, and mutation of a single C-terminal residue abrogated dimer formation and E3 ligase activity was diminished. We further demonstrate that disruption of E2 binding, or dimerization, stabilizes IAP proteins against IAP antagonists in vivo.

Apoptosis is a tightly controlled process that is required for normal development and homeostasis of cell number that when dysregulated contributes to disease (1Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). Amplification of the locus bearing cIAP1 and cIAP2 has been observed in liver, lung, and cervical tumors in humans, raising the possibility that inhibition of cell death by IAP proteins contributes to oncogenesis and provoking the design of drugs to antagonize IAP proteins for the treatment of cancer (3Hunter A.M. Lacasse E.C. Korneluk R.G. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1543-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). IAP proteins are characterized by the presence of one or more zinc-binding baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains that function as protein-protein interaction domains. The N-terminal BIR domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2 interact with the TRAF-N domain of tumor necrosis factor-associated factors (4Samuel T. Welsh K. Lober T. Togo S.H. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

This interaction recruits these IAP proteins to TNF-receptor complexes where they modulate receptor-mediated apoptosis. The C-terminal two BIR domains of cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP interact with, and in the case of XIAP, inhibit caspases. Proapoptotic proteins that have an N-terminal IAP-binding motif sequence, such as Smac/Diablo also bind to these BIR domains and can displace caspases, leading to their activation (2Salvesen G.S.

IAP proteins also bear a C-terminal RING domain that confers ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and is critical to their function (8Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J.

To promote apoptosis of cancer cells, compounds that resemble the N-terminal IAP-binding motif residues of Smac/Diablo have been developed to relieve caspase inhibition by XIAP. Surprisingly, experiments with these “Smac-mimetic” compounds have shown that they primarily antagonize cIAP activity (11Petersen S.L. Peyton M. Minna J. Harran P.

These studies suggest that the normal roles of cIAP1 and cIAP2 are to reduce pro-apoptotic and NF-κB activating signals from members of the TNF receptor superfamily. Consistent with this function, deletion of the gene for cIAP1 or treatment of cells with IAP antagonist compounds leads to activation of NF-κB, and in certain cell types, induction of apoptosis. IAP abundance may be critical because treatment of susceptible cells with Smac-mimetic compounds leads to rapid degradation of cIAP1 (12Varfolomeev E. Blankenship J.W. Wayson S.M. Fedorova A.V.

The RING domains of IAP proteins are required for both dimerization and E3 ligase activity (14Hu S. Yang X. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16182-16187Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Attachment of ubiquitin to proteins requires the sequential action of three enzymes: an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitinconjugating (Ubc) enzyme, and a ubiquitin E3 ligase that specifies the protein to which ubiquitin is added (16Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). The RING domain E3s, such as IAP proteins, function as molecular scaffolds bringing together E2 and target proteins, allowing direct transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the target. In some cases, autoubiquitylation of RING domain containing proteins also occurs, and this enables E3s, including IAP proteins, to regulate their own abundance as well as that of interacting proteins. All RING domains have a conserved structure with two zinc ions coordinated by invariant cysteine and histidine residues (17Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). However, RING domain sequences are variable, and it is likely that this determines their selective binding properties because each RING domain interacts with a subset of the available (∼100) E2 proteins. The structure of only one E2:RING-E3 complex has been solved (Protein data bank (PDB) code fbv) (18Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), and it is not known how the RING domain promotes ubiquitin transfer as the binding interface is distant from the E2s catalytic site. In addition, the E2 undergoes only small changes upon binding the RING domain, and allosteric activation has been proposed (19Ozkan E. Yu H. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18890-18895Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To obtain a detailed understanding of the nature and regulation of the E3 ligase activity of IAP proteins and to determine whether autoubiquitylation is necessary for the pro-apoptotic activity of Smac-mimetic compounds, we determined the structure of the cIAP2 RING domain homodimer, both alone and in complex with the E2 enzyme UbcH5b. These structures show that the cIAP2 RING domain forms symmetrical dimers and that small changes in the RING domain are associated with binding to the E2. Analysis of the E2-E3 interface reveals an invariant core interface on the RING domain that binds E2, with additional contacts likely to comprise specificity determinants. Analysis of RING domain mutants that are structurally intact suggests that in vivo, the E3 ligase activity of cIAP proteins is required for their degradation and that this depends on dimerization. Protein Expression and Purification—Proteins for in vitro experiments and crystallization were expressed from pGEX-6P-3 as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, with the exception of ubiquitin that was produced from pQE80 with an N-terminal histidine tag. Full cloning and purification details are included as supplemental data. Crystallization—Crystals of the cIAP2 RING were grown at 18 °C by the vapor diffusion method. Sitting drops (200 nl) were set up using the Mosquito robot (TTP LabTech Ltd.) and contained a 2:1 ratio of protein (∼5 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5) and crystallization buffer (0.4 m NH4(SO4)2, 1 m LiSO4, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.2). Crystals formed in 1–2 days in the space group C222 with cell dimensions of a = 34.87 Å, b = 66.47 Å, c = 77.47 Å, α = β = γ = 90.00°. The complex was prepared by mixing a 1:1 ratio of cIAP2 RING:UbcH5b and concentrating to ∼15 mg/ml. Crystals formed in 1–4 days in various conditions, with diffraction quality crystals growing from 3.3 m NaCl, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, in space group P6322, with cell dimensions a = 137.2 Å, b = 137.2 Å, c = 111.9 Å, α = β = 90.00°, γ = 120°. Structure Solution and Refinement—Diffraction data from crystals of cIAP2 RING were collected at beamline BL9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) and processed with programs from the CCP4 package (20Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The structure was solved using the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion method (see supplemental data for further details). Diffraction data from crystals of the cIAP2 RING-UbcH5b complex were collected using Cu-Kα radiation, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (21Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) and the cIAP2 RING and UbcH5b (PDB code 2esk) as search models.

Cells were lysed in DISC lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Other reagents used were 500 nm Compound A (Tetralogics), monoclonal α-cIAP1 (Vaux laboratory), 100 nm 4HT, and monoclonal α-β-actin (Sigma). Pull-downs—GST pull-down experiments were used to directly measure interaction between cIAP2 and E2 enzymes. Soluble proteins and glutathione-Sepharose immobilized proteins were mixed for 60 min at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 2 mm dithiothreitol and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2 mm dithiothreitol prior to the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. Samples were then separated on 14.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for analysis using α-His (Qiagen) antibodies. E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Assays—Ubiquitylation reactions containing 2 μm UbcH5b, 50 nm E1, and 10 μm soluble protein were incubated at 37 °C in 40 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 60 μm His-tagged ubiquitin, 5 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were removed at indicated time points, and 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added. Samples were resolved by 14.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for analysis using α-cIAP2 antibodies. To identify the site of ubiquitylation in the cIAP2 RING domain, reactions contained 70 μm of soluble cIAP2 RING. Following ubiquitylation, proteins were resolved by 16% SDS-PAGE, and bands were cut out for in-gel tryptic digest. Mass spectrometry analyses were used to identify fragments that had changed by a ubiquitin specific weight adduct in ubiquitylated samples. Ubiquitylation sites were verified by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The RING Domain of cIAP2 Mediates Autoubiquitylation—To determine the minimal requirements for autoubiquitylation of cIAP2, we used purified recombinant proteins in vitro. A construct corresponding to residues 252–604 (the BIR3, CARD, and RING domains) of cIAP2 was expressed as a GST fusion protein (Fig. 1A). Following affinity purification, cleavage from GST, and elution from resin, the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of cIAP2 BIR3-CARD-RING was apparent (Fig. 1B). No autoubiquitylation was observed when E1 was omitted from the reaction, whereas a ladder of high molecular weight products, due to autoubiquitylation of cIAP2 BIR3-CARD-RING, accumulated when all the components were included (Fig. 1B). A construct containing only the RING domain of cIAP2 (residues 535–604) yielded just a single ubiquitylated band that was not clearly resolved from ubiquitin dimers by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Analysis by mass spectrometry confirmed that a single ubiquitin chain had been added to the RING domain of cIAP2 and that Lys-563 and Lys-579 were the primary sites of ubiquitin attachment. These results indicate that the RING domain alone is both an active E3 ligase and a substrate for autoubiquitylation, but the larger BIR3-CARD-RING protein provides further target sites and a ladder of ubiquitylation products forms. Dimer Formation Depends on Residues N- and C-terminal to the RING Domain—The RING domains of cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP are highly conserved (Fig. 1C), and there is evidence to suggest that the domains are capable of forming both homodimers and heterodimers (15Silke J. Kratina T. Chu D. Ekert P.G. Day C.L. Pakusch M. Huang D.C. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16182-16187Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Silke J. Hawkins C.J.

To further investigate the mechanism of IAP autoubiquitylation and dimerization, we determined the crystal structure of the cIAP2 RING domain (ΔN535) to 2.0 Å resolution (Fig. 1D and Table 1). The core RING domain of cIAP2 bears features common to all RING domains, with two zinc ions coordinated in a cross-braced arrangement by 1 histidine and 7 cysteine residues (ligands indicated in Fig. 1, C and D). The structure was solved in space group C222, with just one RING monomer per asymmetric unit. The RING domain dimer is generated by a crystallographic two-fold symmetry axis. Size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiple angle light scattering (MALS) showed that the RING domain forms stable dimers in solution (Fig. 2C). The dimer interface involves both the core RING domain and residues C-terminal to it, including β3, as well as an N-terminal helix that packs against its dimeric partner, and in total, dimerization buries a surface area of 1018 Å2. As observed in many protein interfaces, the dimer interface is predominantly hydrophobic in nature (Fig. 1E) but is also stabilized by two electrostatic interactions between the charged residues Arg-555 and Glu-554 near the base of the N-terminal α-helix, which are conserved among IAP RINGs. Relative Orientation of Dimeric RING Domains Is Conserved—When compared with other RING domain dimers (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1), the cIAP2 RING domain structure overlays most closely (1.79 Å over 92 residues) with the crystal structure of the MDM2-MDMX RING domain heterodimer (PDB code 2vje) (23Linke K. Mace P.D. Smith C.A. Vaux D.L. Silke J. Day C.L. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The most obvious difference is due to the distinct conformation of residues N-terminal to the core RING domain. In cIAP2, these residues form a helix that constitutes a major part of the dimer interface, whereas in the MDM dimer structure, N-terminal interactions are less extensive, and this region is disordered. However, the β1-β2 loop of the MDM RING domains interacts much more closely with β3 of the adjacent monomer at the dimer interface than in cIAP2 (Fig. 2A). Despite these differences, the RING domains in the MDM and IAP dimers have a similar disposition, and interactions involving β3 at the C terminus of each RING domain dominate, a characteristic that is not seen in other structures of RING domain dimers. Instead, the C termini of both BRCA1-BARD and Bmi1-Ring1b are helical (supplemental Fig. S1) and are in close proximity to the N-terminal helix, as well as the equivalent helices of their respective dimeric partners (24Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 25Buchwald G. van der Stoop P. Weichenrieder O. Perrakis A. van Lohuizen M. Sixma T.K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Although the dimer interface is quite different, the RING domains of the cIAP2 dimer overlay well with those of the BRCA1-BARD dimer (2.71 Å over 110 residues) and the Bmi1-Ring1b dimer (3.44 Å over 99 residues). The related U-box proteins PRP19 and CHIP also overlay closely (26Vander Kooi C.W. Ohi M.D. Rosenberg J.A. Oldham M.L. Newcomer M.E. Gould K.L. Chazin W.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Zhang M. Windheim M. Roe S.M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 525-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The conserved disposition of the RING domains in distinct dimers suggests that the relative position of the domains is of functional relevance. The high degree of structural homology between the MDM and cIAP2 RING domain dimers suggested that many residues would have equivalent roles in both proteins. In MDM2, the C-terminal residues are required for dimerization and for activity, with a single aromatic residue located 3 residues from the C terminus (Tyr-489 in MDM2) having a critical role (23Linke K. Mace P.D. Smith C.A. Vaux D.L. Silke J. Day C.L. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 28Uldrijan S. Pannekoek W.J. Vousden K.H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Likewise, in IAP proteins, the C-terminal residues are required for dimer formation as deletion of the 6 C-terminal residues from cIAP1 disrupts the cIAP1-XIAP heterodimer (15Silke J. Kratina T. Chu D. Ekert P.G. Day C.L. Pakusch M. Huang D.C. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16182-16187Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To determine whether the equivalent aromatic C-terminal residue in IAP proteins is also required for E3 ligase activity, we mutated phenylalanine 602 to alanine in cIAP2 (F602A). Like MDM2, this mutation disrupts the E3 ligase activity of purified cIAP2 BIR3-CARD-RING and RING proteins, and ubiquitin ladders no longer form (Fig. 2B, data not shown). Analysis of the RING domain by MALS (Fig. 2C) showed that a shift from dimer to monomer is associated with the F602A mutation, suggesting that a stable RING dimer is required for formation of a ubiquitin ladder. The RING domains of IAP proteins are highly conserved (Fig. 1B), and we anticipate that our studies with cIAP2 provide a model for other IAP proteins. To investigate this and to show that the C-terminal aromatic is also required for activity in cells, we mutated the equivalent C-terminal residue in mouse cIAP1 (Phe-610) to alanine (supplemental Fig. S2) and expressed the full-length protein in cIAP1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 2D). The WT and mutant forms had similar levels in healthy cells. However, when an IAP antagonist compound, which has previously been shown to promote degradation of IAP proteins, was added (11Petersen S.L. Peyton M. Minna J. Harran P. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), WT cIAP1 was degraded, but the levels of the F610A mutant protein were not diminished. This shows that autoubiquitylation of IAP proteins in vivo and in vitro depends on the aromatic residue located 3 residues from the C terminus. These parallels suggest that the C-terminal residues in IAP and MDM RING domains fulfill similar functions and that ubiquitylation of target lysine residues depends upon the integrity of the C-terminal residues. The cIAP2 RING Dimer Recruits Two UbcH5b Molecules—The affinity of cIAP2 RING for UbcH5b was measured using isothermal titration calorimetry (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B) and found to be between 19 and 43 μm. The RING domains of XIAP and cIAP1 bound UbcH5b with comparable affinity in GST pull-down experiments (data not shown), suggesting that the RING domains of these IAP proteins form similar complexes with UbcH5b. This relatively high affinity interaction allowed crystallization of the complex between the cIAP2 RING domain and the E2, UbcH5b. The structure was solved to 3.4 Å resolution by molecular replacement, using the RING monomer and UbcH5b (19Ozkan E. Yu H. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18890-18895Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) as search models. A single chain of each protein in the asymmetric unit was identified, corresponding to a relatively high solvent content of ∼80%. Each RING domain interacts independently with UbcH5b, and analogous to the structure of the RING domain alone, the RING domain dimer two-fold axis coincides with a crystallographic two-fold axis. As a consequence, the cIAP2 RING homodimer, with UbcH5b bound to each RING domain, is symmetrical (Fig. 3A). Interaction between the RING domain and the E2 involves residues in the α-β3 loop of the RING domain, as well as residues in the N-terminal helix and the loop between this and β1 (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3C). Notably, three salt bridges are formed between Asp-562 and Lys-4, Glu-553 and Lys-8, and Arg-549 and Asp-12 of cIAP2 and UbcH5b, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3D). Further H-bonds are formed between Arg-5, Lys-8, and Ser-94 of UbcH5b and main-chain atoms of Val-559, Met-561, and Pro-589 of the RING domain, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). Analysis of the B-factors is consistent with these residues contributing to E2 recruitment as relative to the rest of the structure, a decrease in the B-factors of RING domain interface residues is observed in the complex. Differences in the RING Domain Associated with Binding to an E2—Comparison of the polypeptide backbone of the RING domain dimer in the presence and absence of the E2 shows localized changes. In addition to the residues that directly contact UbcH5b, the C-terminal residues are also displaced (Fig. 3B). Direct interaction with the E2 probably accounts for differences in the N-terminal helix and following loop. However, the shift in the position of the C-terminal residues is likely to be due to an indirect effect, with small differences in the α-β3 loop of one monomer, which contacts the E2, affecting the position of the C terminus of the other monomer (Fig. 3C). The altered position of the C terminus may be important for activity as the residues that move include Phe-602, which is required for E3 ligase activity (Fig. 2B). The equivalent residue is also essential for the ubiquitylation of MDMX by MDM2 and has been proposed to form part of an extended surface that mediates transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the target lysine (20Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). This is the first report of a RING domain E3 ligase structure in the presence and absence of an E2. The differences observed suggest that although binding depends on local rearrangements of interface residues to optimize interactions, ubiquitin transfer from E2 to the target lysine may depend on small changes in the RING domain, as well as the allosteric effects already documented in the E2 (19Ozkan E. Yu H. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18890-18895Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Disruption of the E2 Interface Impedes IAP Homeostasis and Antagonist Action—To probe the role of individual residues in the E2-binding surface of the RING domain (supplemental Fig. S4), site-directed mutagenesis of selected interface residues was performed. The ability of these mutants to bind UbcH5b was tested in GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the surface identified in the complex structure, three hydrophobic to alanine mutations in cIAP2 (V559A, L585A, and I590A), as well as D562A, interfered with UbcH5b binding, whereas diminished binding was observed for the mutants K558A and P589A. These residues interact with Arg-5, Pro-95, Ala-96, and Lys-4 among other UbcH5b residues (supplemental Fig. S3C). The residues in UbcH5b that interact with the RING domain of cIAP2 coincide with the interface required for interaction of the BRCA1 RING domain with E2 enzymes (29Christensen D.E. Brzovic P.S. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), suggesting that similar contacts are involved. To further investigate the link between E3 ligase activity and E2 recruitment, we mutated Val-567 in mouse cIAP1, which is equivalent to Val-559 in cIAP2 (supplemental Fig. S2), and expressed it in cIAP1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. cIAP1 containing V567A had slightly higher steady state protein levels than WT, and the levels were only marginally reduced when an IAP antagonist was added (Fig. 4B). This result shows that disrupting the E2-binding interface impedes E3 ligase activity in cells. Together, these results show that autoubiquitylation and degradation of IAP proteins following the addition of IAP antagonists depends on an intact E2-binding site. In addition, these interface mutants provide a general method of specifically knocking out the E3 ligase activity of RING domains without"

DNA microarray technologies can provide detailed raw data about chromosomal aberrations in tumor samples. Computational analysis is needed (1) to deduce from raw array data actual amplification or deletion events for chromosomal fragments and (2) to distinguish causal chromosomal alterations from functionally neutral ones. We present a comprehensive computational approach, RAE, designed to robustly map chromosomal alterations in tumor samples and assess their functional importance in cancer. To demonstrate the methodology, we experimentally profile copy number changes in a clinically aggressive subtype of soft-tissue sarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma, and computationally derive a portrait of candidate oncogenic alterations and their target genes. Many affected genes are known to be involved in sarcomagenesis; others are novel, including mediators of adipocyte differentiation, and may include valuable therapeutic targets. Taken together, we present a statistically robust methodology applicable to high-resolution genomic data to assess the extent and function of copy-number alterations in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2143416388,"Forecasting future eruptions of Vesuvius is an important challenge for volcanologists, as its reawakening could threaten the lives of 700,000 people living near the volcano. Critical to the evaluation of hazards associated with the next eruption is the estimation of the depth of the magma reservoir, one of the main parameters controlling magma properties and eruptive style. Petrological studies have indicated that during past activity, magma chambers were at depths between 3 and 16 km (refs 3-7). Geophysical surveys have imaged some levels of seismic attenuation, the shallowest of which lies at 8-9 km depth, and these have been tentatively interpreted as levels of preferential magma accumulation. By using experimental phase equilibria, carried out on material from four main explosive events at Vesuvius, we show here that the reservoirs that fed the eruptive activity migrated from 7-8 km to 3-4 km depth between the ad 79 (Pompeii) and ad 472 (Pollena) events. If data from the Pomici di Base event 18.5 kyr ago and the 1944 Vesuvius eruption are included, the total upward migration of the reservoir amounts to 9-11 km. The change of preferential magma ponding levels in the upper crust can be attributed to differences in the volatile content and buoyancy of ascending magmas, as well as to changes in local stress field following either caldera formation or volcano spreading. Reservoir migration, and the possible influence on feeding rates, should be integrated into the parameters used for defining expected eruptive scenarios at Vesuvius."

Nanomolar ABA increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from RIN-m and INS-1 cells and from murine and human pancreatic islets.

Himmelbach A. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A similar physiological role for ABA has been recently unveiled also in lower Metazoa (marine sponges and Hydroids), where autocrine production of ABA in response to environmental stimuli, temperature rise in sponges or light exposure in Hydroids, has been shown to stimulate water filtration and tissue regeneration, respectively (2Zocchi E. Carpaneto A. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14859-14864Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3Zocchi E.

The discovery of the synthesis and functional activity of a plant hormone in lower Metazoa suggested a possible role for ABA in animal cells. Indeed, most recent results indicate that ABA production occurs in human granulocytes stimulated with physical (temperature rise, latex beads) or chemical (phorbol myristate acetate) stimuli and that ABA activates several functional activities of granulocytes (including phagocytosis, migration, production of reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide) involved in their defensive function (5Bruzzone S. Moreschi I. Usai C. Guida L. Damonte G. Salis A. Scarfì S. Millo E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5759-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, ABA behaves as an endogenous pro-inflammatory hormone in human granulocytes. The remarkable conservation of the role of ABA as a stress signal from plants to humans is paralleled by the strikingly similar signal transduction pathway of the hormone in plants and animals. This pathway sequentially involves phosphorylation and activation of ADP-ribosyl cyclase (ADPRC), overproduction of the universal calcium mobilizer cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) (6Lee H.C. Walseth T.F.

In human granulocytes, ABA binding to the plasma membrane occurs through a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive receptor-G protein complex, leading to a rapid increase of the [cAMP]i, activation of protein kinase A (PKA), phosphorylation of the ADPRC CD38 with cADPR overproduction, eventually leading to an increase of the [Ca2+]i (5Bruzzone S.

The following considerations are suggested to explore whether ABA had an effect on insulin secretion from mammalian β cells: (i) acute physical stress (trauma, infections, and fever) is known to affect blood glucose levels, inducing hyperglycemia through complex mechanisms, partly involving the action of catecholamines and cortisol but also because of the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on pancreatic β cell function (10McCowen K.C.

Results obtained indicate that ABA, at nanomolar concentrations, potentiates insulin release in response to glucose in rat insulinoma cells (RIN-m and INS-1) and in human and murine pancreatic islets.

After 48 h, the culture medium was replaced, and cells were incubated for 4 h in Low Glucose medium (LG-medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5.5 mm glucose and supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). The medium was discarded, and cells were treated as follows. RIN-m cells were incubated for 15 min or for 1 h at 37°C with fresh LG-medium or High Glucose medium (HG-medium: same as LG-medium supplemented with glucose to 16.7 mm final concentration) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of ABA; INS-1 cells were incubated for 30 min in LG-KRH or HG-KRH (same composition as LG-buffer, but containing 20 mm glucose) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of ABA. The medium was recovered and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 1 min, and insulin concentration was determined by EIA (Rat Insulin Enzyme Immunoassay Kit, SpiBio, Montigny le Bretonneux, France). The human and murine islet suspensions were divided into Eppendorf tubes (100 human or 20 murine islets per determination); after islet sedimentation, supernatants were discarded, and islets were washed once by sedimentation with 0.5 ml of LG-KRH. Islets were incubated in LG-KRH (0.5 and 0.2 ml for human and murine islets, respectively) for 7, 30, or 120 min; supernatants were recovered, centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 1 min, and saved for determination of the insulin content (“basal value”). LG- or HG-KRH, with or without ABA, were then added to the islets for 7, 30, or 120 min; supernatants were recovered, centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 1 min, and saved for determination of the insulin content (“stimulated value”). Insulin concentration was determined with an EIA kit that recognizes rat, murine, and human insulin (rat insulin enzyme immunoassay kit; SpiBio). Results are expressed as Stimulation Index (SI = stimulated value/basal value). Determination of Intracellular cAMP Levels—RIN-m and INS-1 cells were seeded in 35 × 10-mm dishes (106 cells/dish). After 48 h, the medium was replaced with fresh LG-medium, and cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The medium was discarded and replaced with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). ABA (1 μm) was added (or not, control); incubations were stopped after 0, 1, 2, and 5 min by removal of HBSS and addition of 200 μl of ice-cold PCA (0.6 m). When specified, cells were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro-20-1724 (10 μm final concentration). Cell extracts were collected and centrifuged to remove proteins; the cAMP content was measured on the neutralized cell extracts (25Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) by a radioimmunoassay (GE Healthcare). The human islet suspension was divided into Eppendorf tubes (100 islets/determination); after islet sedimentation, supernatants were discarded, and islets were washed once by sedimentation with 0.5 ml of LG-KRH. Islets were incubated in LG-KRH (0.5 ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro-20-1724 (10 μm final concentration) was added during the last 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and LG-KRH, with or without 1 μm ABA, was added to the islets for 1, 5, and 15 min. Incubations were stopped by addition of PCA (0.6 m final concentration); the acid extracts were neutralized, and the cAMP content was determined by radioimmunoassay. Determination of Intracellular cADPR Levels—RIN-m cells were seeded in 35 × 10-mm dishes (106 cells/dish). After 48 h, the medium was replaced with fresh LG, and cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The medium was discarded and replaced with HBSS. ABA (1 μm) was added (or not, control); incubations were stopped after 5 min by removal of HBSS and addition of 300 μl of ice-cold PCA (0.6 m). Cell extracts were collected and centrifuged to remove proteins; the cADPR content was measured on the neutralized perchloric acid cell extracts with a highly sensitive enzymatic cycling assay (25Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The human islet suspension was divided into Eppendorf tubes (100 islets/determination); after islet sedimentation, supernatants were discarded, and islets were washed once by sedimentation with 0.5 ml of LG-KRH. Islets were incubated in LG-KRH (0.5 ml) for 30 min at 37 °C; the supernatant was discarded, and LG- or HG-KRH, with or without ABA (10 nm to 1 μm), was added to the islets for 10 min. The supernatants were then discarded; PCA (300 μl, 0.6 m) was added to the islets; the acid extracts were neutralized, and the cADPR content was determined with the enzymatic cycling assay (25Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Assays of ADP-ribosyl Cyclase Activity—RIN-m cells (5 × 106 cells) or human pancreatic islets (103 islets) were incubated in 0.5 ml of KRH at 37 °C with 0.1 mm β-NAD+, in the absence (control) or in the presence of 10 μm ABA. Aliquots (100 μl) were withdrawn at various times, and the enzymatic reactions were stopped by addition of 220 μl of 0.9 m PCA to each aliquot. The cADPR concentration was measured by enzymatic cycling (25Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Protein determination in each sample was performed according to Bradford (26Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (215700) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis of CD38—Human islets (500 islets) and RIN-m cells (105 cells) were lysed by sonication (30 s at 3 watts on ice) in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma; catalog number P8340 and P2850, respectively), and the protein concentration in the lysates was determined (26Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (215700) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the cell lysates (20 μg protein) were loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE; Western blot analysis and immunoenzymatic detection of CD38 with the anti-CD38 MoAb IB4 were performed according to instructions of the Immobilon Western kit (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). For CD38 immunopurification, lysates from human islets (containing 0.2 mg of protein) were diluted 2-fold in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.25% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and preincubated with 5 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare) for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotating plate. The resin was removed by centrifugation, and the lysates were incubated in the presence of 3 μg of anti-CD38 MoAb IB4 on a rotating plate for 3 h at 4 °C. Twenty μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were then added, and lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4°C on a rotating plate. Samples were centrifuged and supernatants were removed. The resin was washed three times with 1.5 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40). Elution of immune complexes was then obtained by adding 100 μl of a modified Laemmli sample buffer 4× (8% SDS, 0.4 g/ml sucrose, 80 μg/ml bromphenol blue, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), at 99 °C for 10 min. Samples were then centrifuged and the supernatants loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE. The subsequent Western blot analyses and immunoenzymatic detection either with the IB4 anti-CD38 MoAb or with the anti-phosphoserine MoAb (clone PSR-45; Sigma catalog number P3430) were performed according to instructions of the Immobilon Western kit (Millipore Corp.). Real Time PCR Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from 106 RIN-m cells and from 103 human islets using the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen, Milano, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quality and quantity of RNA were analyzed using NanoDrop instrumentation (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Purified total mRNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad). The cDNA was used as template for real time PCR analysis; reactions were performed in a Chromo-4 detection instrument (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The Rattus norvegicus CD38- and human CD38-specific primers (GenBank™ accession numbers NM_013127 and NM_001775, respectively) were designed by using Beacon Designer 2.0 software (Bio-Rad) and purchased from TIB-MOLBIOL (Genova, Italy); their sequences were as follows: 5′-GTGAAGAATCCTGAGCATCC-3′ (forward) 5′-TGTTAGCATTGTAGTAGAGACC-3′ (reverse) for rat CD38 and 5′-GGACACGCTGCTAGGCTACC-3′ (forward) 5′-CATCACATGGACCACATCACAGG-3′ (reverse) for human CD38. Each sample was assayed in triplicate in a 20-μl amplification reaction containing 10 ng of cDNA, 400 nm each of sense and antisense primers, and 10 μl of 2× iQ Custom Sybr Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The amplification program included an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of two steps, each comprising heating to 95 and to 61 °C, respectively. Fluorescent products were detected at the last step of each cycle. To verify the purity of the products, a melting curve was produced after each run. Values were normalized to β-actin (reference internal gene) mRNA expression. Statistical analysis of the quantitative real time PCR was obtained using the iQ5 Optical System Software version 1.0 (Bio-Rad) based on the 2–ΔΔCt method, which calculated relative changes in gene expression of the target (CD38) normalized to β-actin and relative to a calibrator. Amplification efficiencies of target and reference genes were determined by generating standard curves. Data are presented as means ± S.D. of three different experiments performed in triplicate. Detection of ABA—Human pancreatic islets (103/assay), RIN-m cells, or INS-1 cells (106/assay), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, isolated by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation (106/assay), or murine acinar cells (derived from the purification of pancreatic islets) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in LG- or HG-KRH. Cell suspensions were centrifuged (9,000 × g for 1 min), and 4 volumes of distilled methanol was added to each supernatant. Cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of deionized water and sonicated at 3 watts for 10 s; aliquots were saved for determination of protein content (26Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (215700) Google Scholar) and 2 ml of distilled methanol was added to the cell lysates. Trace amounts of [3H]ABA (3 × 103 cpm, i.e. 35 fmol) were added as an internal standard to each sample to allow calculation of the extraction yield, and ABA was extracted as described previously (2Zocchi E. Carpaneto A. Cerrano C. Bavestrello G. Giovine M. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14859-14864Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). ABA content in extracts from cells and supernatants was routinely measured by a sensitive and specific ELISA kit (Agdia, Elkhart, IN), according to the manufacturer's instructions. ABA identification was confirmed by HPLC-coupled mass spectrometry (mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectra), performed on dedicated methanol extracts of cell pellets and supernatants after HPLC purification of ABA (5Bruzzone S. Moreschi I. Usai C. Guida L. Damonte G. Salis A. Scarfì S. Millo E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5759-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—All parameters were tested by paired t test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test or Dunnett's method, as appropriate; p values <0.05 were considered significant. Effect of ABA on Insulin Secretion from RIN-m and INS-1 Cells—Preliminarily, we tested the glucose dependence of insulin release in RIN-m and INS-1 cells. In KRH containing 5.5 mm glucose (LG-buffer) or 16.7 mm glucose (HG-buffer), insulin secretion by RIN-m was 1.3 ± 0.1- or 2.2 ± 0.2-fold higher relative to that in glucose-free KRH. In the presence of 30 mm KCl in HG-buffer, inducing maximal secretion, insulin release was 3.4 ± 0.4-fold higher than in glucose-free KRH (p < 0.01 by ANOVA, comparing values in glucose-free, LG, HG, and KCl-HG, n = 3). In INS-1 cells, insulin secretion in LG-buffer, HG-buffer, or in KCl-HG buffer was 1.5 ± 0.3-, 2.3 ± 0.4-, and 6.6 ± 1.1-fold higher, respectively, relative to that in glucose-free KRH (p < 0.001 by ANOVA, comparing values in glucose-free, LG, HG, and KCl-HG, n = 3). In the presence of 5.5 mm glucose in the culture medium (LG-medium), basal insulin secretion from RIN-m cells (2.6 ± 1.3 ng insulin/106 cells/h, n = 8) was increased by ABA ∼1.6-fold relative to release in LG, with 10 nm of the hormone being as effective as 10 μm (Fig. 1A, gray bars, p < 0.001 by ANOVA, comparing insulin secretion induced by 0–104 nm ABA in LG. No significant difference was found between insulin release in 10, 102, 103, and 104 nm ABA in LG, p > 0.6, by Tukey test.). At 1 nm, ABA did not significantly stimulate insulin release from RIN-m cells neither in LG-medium (Fig. 1A, gray bar) nor in HG-medium (Fig. 1A, black bar). Insulin secretion (relative to LG) induced by 10 nm ABA in LG was similar (p = 0.49 by t test, n = 6) to that observed in a high glucose, ABA-free medium (HG-medium, 16.7 mm glucose) (Fig. 1A, gray bar at 10 nm ABA compared with black bar at 0 nm ABA). ABA also potentiated insulin secretion at high glucose concentrations, in a statistically significant manner for ABA concentrations ranging between 10 nm and 10 μm (p < 0.001 by ANOVA, n = 6) (Fig. 1A, black bars). No significant difference was observed between insulin release in 10, 102, 103. and 104 nm ABA in HG (p > 0.06 by Tukey test). Finally, at each ABA concentration tested, insulin release in HG was significantly higher than in LG (Fig. 1A, black bar compared with the gray bar at the same ABA concentration (p < 0.001 by t test)). Also in INS-1 cells, 10 nm ABA increased insulin secretion ∼2-fold in LG-buffer as well as in HG-buffer (relative to release in LG without ABA, Fig. 1B, gray bars, or to release in HG without ABA, Fig. 1B, black bars). Similarly to what was observed in RIN-m, 10 nm of the hormone was as effective as 10 μm (Fig. 1B, gray bars, p < 0.001 by ANOVA, comparing insulin secretion induced by 0–104 nm ABA in LG. No significant difference was found between insulin release at 10, 102, 103, and 104 nm ABA in LG, p > 0.6 by Tukey test.). At 1 nm, ABA slightly but significantly stimulated insulin release from INS-1 cells in LG-buffer (1.5-fold relative to LG without ABA, Fig. 1B, gray bar), as well as in HG-buffer without ABA (1.6-fold Fig. 1B, black bar). ABA at 0.1 nm was without effect at both glucose concentrations (Fig. 1B). We investigated whether ABA also increased insulin secretion in the absence of glucose. In RIN-m cells incubated in glucose-free KRH, 1 μm ABA induced insulin secretion (Fig. 1C, white bars) and also potentiated insulin secretion in LG-buffer (Fig. 1C, gray bars). Both ABA enantiomers, (+)- and (–)-cis,trans-ABA, were similarly effective in stimulating insulin release from RIN-m (Fig. 1D), in line with what was observed on the [Ca2+]i increase in human granulocytes (5Bruzzone S. Moreschi I. Usai C. Guida L. Damonte G. Salis A. Scarfì S. Millo E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5759-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The same inhibitors that were shown to target the ABA signaling pathway in granulocytes (5Bruzzone S. Moreschi I. Usai C. Guida L. Damonte G. Salis A. Scarfì S. Millo E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5759-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were tested for their ability to prevent ABA-induced insulin secretion from RIN-m cells incubated in LG-medium. Pret"

The two-step reaction catalyzed by these enzymes (substrate adenylation followed by transfer to the reactive thiol group of CoA or the phosphopantheinyl prosthetic group of peptidyl carrier proteins) has been suggested to proceed via large scale rearrangements of structural domains within the enzyme. The structures of DltA reported here reveal the determinants for d-Ala substrate specificity and confirm that the peptidyl carrier protein-activating domains are able to adopt multiple conformational states, in this case corresponding to the thiolation reaction. Comparisons of available structures allow us to propose a mechanism whereby small perturbations of finely balanced metastable structural states would be able to direct an ordered formation of non-ribosomal synthetase products.

The d-alanine-d-alanyl carrier protein ligase (DltA) catalyzes the first step of the overall reaction, i.e. the activation of d-Ala at the expense of ATP to form a high energy d-alanyl-AMP intermediate, followed by transfer of d-Ala as a thiol ester to the phosphopantheinyl prosthetic group of the d-Ala carrier protein, DltC (Scheme 1). By as yet unknown mechanisms, the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) 3The abbreviations used are: PCP, peptidyl carrier protein; A-domain, adenylation domain; NRPS, nonribosomal peptide synthetase; ACS, acetyl-CoA synthetase; LC-FACS, long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase; P-loop, phosphate binding loop; PheA, phenylalanine activating A-domain. -bound d-Ala is transported across the membrane by the membrane spanning DltB, whereupon DltD catalyzes the final step of d-Ala incorporation into lipoteichoic acid (8Debabov D.V.

Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1367-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), making this system an attractive target for potential antimicrobial agents. Indeed, direct inhibition of DltA increases the susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria to antibiotics (13May J.J. Finking R. Wiegeshoff F. Weber T.T. Bandur N. Koert U. Marahiel M.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2993-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The ATP-dependent activation of the amino acid substrate by DltA together with utilization of a carrier domain DltC for transport, closely resembles features of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). NRPSs are modular enzymes involved in the synthesis of small peptides of diverse pharmacological relevance, including antimicrobial, antiviral, immunosuppressant, and cytostatic agents (14Sieber S.A. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 715-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 15Schwarzer D. Marahiel M.A. Naturwissenschaften. 2001; 88: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Finking R. Marahiel M.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 453-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Their ability to synthesize peptides containing non-proteinogenic amino acids, lipids, or cyclized units underlies their immense pharmaceutical potential. In contrast to ribosomal peptide synthesis, individual NRPSs are dedicated to the generation of a single product (or range of differently processed products). These multienzyme complexes are organized into modules that are responsible for the specific incorporation of monomeric components into the nascent peptide. Each module is further subdivided into a series of domains 4The term “domain” is used here to describe functional units within a module. The A-domains, however, are further divided into two major structural domains, the N- and C-terminal (or large and small respectively) domains, discussed in the remainder of this manuscript. that catalyze individual steps of non ribosomal peptide synthesis. A “minimal module” consists of an adenylation (A) domain, responsible for monomer activation, a PCP or thiolation (T) domain that transfers activated monomers and intermediates between individual domains and modules, and a condensation (C) domain, which carries out peptide bond formation. As primary determinants for selection and incorporation of the monomeric components of NRPS products, A-domains have received particular attention (17Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 18Challis G.L. Ravel J. Townsend C.A. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 211-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Understanding the selectivity determinants of NRPS A-domains allows inference of potential products of unknown clusters and raises the possibility of generating novel “natural products” with potential pharmaceutical benefit, for example for expanding the repertoire of peptide antibiotics. The A-domains catalyze substrate activation at the expense of ATP to form an acyl adenylate intermediate, a reaction that places them within the broad family of adenylate-forming enzymes. In a second step, the activated substrate is transferred to an acceptor, such as tRNA (amino-acyl tRNA synthetases), the thiol group of coenzyme A (acetyl CoA synthetase) or of a PCP phosphopantheinyl cofactor (NRPSs), or to molecular oxygen in an oxidative decarboxylation reaction (firefly luciferase) (19Chang K.H. Xiang H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15650-15659Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although tRNA synthetases and NRPS A-domains catalyze similar reactions (activation of a substrate amino acid and transfer to a suitable carrier group), they show no evolutionary or structural relation to one other (20Weber T. Marahiel M.A. Structure. 2001; 9: 3-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the other hand, significant similarities are observed for several other members of the adenylate-forming superfamily. Structural data are currently available for firefly luciferase (21Conti E.

Despite low sequence identity, these enzymes exhibit very similar secondary structural elements, folding essentially into a large N-terminal domain and a small C-terminal domain, with the active site in between. The relative orientations of the large and small domains vary between the various structures, however. Five different arrangements have been reported that are thought to be associated with various stages of the reaction. Three different “open” forms, in which the active site is accessible to substrate but residues necessary for catalysis are remote from the substrate binding sites, have been observed in the absence of ligands for firefly luciferase from Photinus pyralis (21Conti E.

Nature. 2006; 440: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) reveals the substrate binding pocket almost completely isolated from bulk solvent (“closed” conformation) through close association of the two domains around the active site. Conservation of crucial residues in the vicinity of the substrate adenylate suggests that this conformation is responsible for the first half-reaction, namely the formation of the substrate adenylate (Scheme 1). The third arrangement of the two domains, observed for ACS from S. enterica (26Gulick A.M. Starai V.J. Horswill A.R. Homick K.M. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2866-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and LC-FACS (29Hisanaga Y. Ago H. Nakagawa N. Hamada K. Ida K. Yamamoto M. Hori T. Arii Y. Sugahara M. Kuramitsu S.

Zako T. Ueda H. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4389-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Branchini B.R. Southworth T.L. Murtiashaw M.H. Wilkinson S.R. Khattak N.F. Rosenberg J.C. Zimmer M.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6536-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown in crystallo that LC-FACS is able to catalyze the adenylation reaction in the “thiolation conformation” (29Hisanaga Y. Ago H. Nakagawa N. Hamada K. Ida K. Yamamoto M. Hori T. Arii Y. Sugahara M. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Miyano M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31717-31726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), whereas all NRPS A-domain structures solved to date have been observed only in the adenylation conformation both in the presence and absence of substrates (24Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 25May J.J. Kessler N. Marahiel M.A. Stubbs M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12120-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As a stand-alone adenylation domain that specifically selects and activates a d-amino acid (d-Ala) to form the corresponding aminoacyl-adenylate (5Perego M. Glaser P. Minutello A. Strauch M.A. Leopold K. Fischer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15598-15606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), DltA is particularly interesting. Nearly all NRPSs accept l-amino acids as substrates; although some A-domains are able to accept both enantiomeric forms, l-amino acid substrates are generally converted to the corresponding d-forms when necessary in situ through integral epimerization domains (33Schwarzer D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Very recently, however, a stand-alone A-domain, responsible for the initiation of the bona fide NRPS product leinamycin, has been described that activates d-Ala (34Tang G.L. Cheng Y.Q. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20273-20282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Non-proteinogenic substrates such as d-amino acids form an integral part of non-ribosome-synthesized peptides, yet no d-amino acid specific A-domain has been structurally characterized until now. Here we report the crystal structure of DltA from B. subtilis MR168, crystallized in the presence of substrates d-Ala, ATP, and MgCl2. Based on the structure, we have been able to construct a DltA variant with relaxed stereoselectivity, raising the possibility for engineering A-domains of tailored specificity. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of DltA—Cloning and expression of the dltA gene, amplified from chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis MR168 as a C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein in Escherichia coli M15, have been described previously (13May J.J. Finking R. Wiegeshoff F. Weber T.T. Bandur N. Koert U. Marahiel M.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2993-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Purification was performed as described with minor changes; the binding buffer for nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography contained 10 mm imidazole to reduce nonspecific binding of untagged proteins. Purity was estimated using 10% SDS gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The protein was concentrated to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml, determined photometrically at a wavelength of 280 nm. Mutagenesis and ATP-Pyrophosphate Exchange Assay—The following primers (Metabion) were used for site directed mutagenesis (Stratagene): 5′-CAT GCG GAC ACA TTT ATG TTT GCG GGA GAG GTT CTT CCG G-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCG GAA GAA CCT CTC CCG CAA ACA TAA ATG TGT CCG CAT G-3′ (reverse) for C268A and 5′-GAC ACA TTT ATG TTT GAC GGA GAG GTT CTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAG AAC CTC TCC GTC AAA CAT AAA TGT GTC-3′ (reverse) for C268D. Expression and purification of mutant proteins was identical to that of native DltA. The activity and specificity of both wild type and mutant DltAs were investigated using the ATP-pyrophosphate exchange assay as described (17Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Both l and d amino acids were tested as well as the non-proteinogenic l- and d-aminobutyric acid. Reaction mixtures (100 μl final volume) contained 100 pmol of enzyme in assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl), 1 mm amino acid, and 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm pyrophosphate, and 0.15 μCi of tetrasodium [32P]pyrophosphate at 37 °C. Preparation of Selenomethionine-labeled Protein—Selenomethionine-labeled protein was prepared for phase determination (35Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Expression was carried out at 37 °C in M9 medium with carbon source at 4 g/liter. At mid-log phase, the medium was supplemented with l-Lys, l-Phe, and l-Thr at 100 mg/ml, l-Ile, l-Leu, and l-Val at 50 mg/ml, and selenomethionine at 60 mg/ml before inducing with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight. The purification procedure was identical to that of the native protein except that all buffers contained 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Crystallization Conditions—Before crystallization, DltA was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of its substrates 2 mm d-Ala, 5 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2. Crystals of native DltA, grown using sitting drop vapor diffusion by mixing equal volumes of protein (20 mg/ml) and a buffer solution containing 0.1 m sodium citrate, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, pH 6.0, attained a maximum size over a period of 2 months at 25 °C. The crystals belong to space group I222, with cell constants a = 90.56, b = 94.99, and c = 132.55Å. A second crystal form, grown in the presence of DltC in a 1:1.2 ratio as well as the substrates d-Ala, Mg2+, and ATP, was obtained from a buffer solution containing 30% polyethylene glycol 1000 at pH 6.5. These crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 (a = 45.8, b = 91.4, and c = 122.4 Å). Selenomethionine-labeled DltA yielded only small crystals when crystallized under similar conditions to native protein; reasonable sizes could be obtained using 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 30% polyethylene glycol 8000 at pH 6.5. These crystals were isomorphous to the I222 native form. Data Collection and Refinement—Data were collected on beamline BW6 at DESY, Hamburg and at the PSF beam line at BESSY, Berlin, and evaluated using XDS (36Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar). Native DltA crystals (I222 form) were rapidly soaked in the reservoir solution supplemented with 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant, mounted on loops, and flash-cooled at 170 K in a nitrogen gas cryostream. The crystals diffracted to 2.28 Å resolution and contained 1 molecule per asymmetric unit. Crystals of the second form (P212121) diffracted to 2.6 Å resolution and also contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit. All attempts at molecular replacement for both crystal forms using various known A-domain structures were unsuccessful. Single wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected at the peak wavelength of λ = 0.97888 to 3 Å for the selenomethionine-labeled protein at DESY and evaluated using the HKL package (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). All 12 substituted selenium atoms could be found using the SHELX package (38Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), providing an initial interpretable electron density. Model building was performed using the program O (39Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and the structures were refined using CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The P212121 crystal form was solved by molecular replacement using the I222 structure as search model and rebuilt and refined as described above. Despite cocrystallization with DltC, the P212121 crystal form revealed neither density nor space for the carrier protein, corroborated by the specific volume of the crystal. No differences between the structures from the two crystal forms could be discerned; as a result of the higher resolution of the I222 form, only this structure will be described further. The final structure(s) consists of residues 1–508 (including 3 residues from the C-terminal His tag); residues 132–139 are poorly ordered and exhibit high temperature factors.

Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Two fixed points were used to guide the manual docking of DltC; the position of the DltC N terminus (within 20–25 Å of the C terminus of DltA (44Drake E.J. Nicolai D.A. Gulick A.M. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)) and that of the reactive site Ser36 (to allow in silico coupling of the phosphopantheinyl prosthetic group derived from the ACS structure). No attempts at energy minimization or molecular dynamics were made for any of the modeled structures. Multiple sequence alignments of A-domains of unknown structure were performed using T-Coffee (45Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5514) Google Scholar). Overall Structure of DltA and Comparison with Other Adenylation Domains—The overall structure of DltA, similar to those of previously determined members of the adenylate forming family, consists of two distinct domains, a large N-terminal domain (residues 1–395) and a small C-terminal domain (residues 400–508), with a four-residue “hinge” in between (Fig. 1). All residues are defined by electron density, although the region 132–139 is rather weak and is presumably flexible. The relative orientation of the large and the small domains is equivalent to that observed in S. enterica ACS (26Gulick A.M. Starai V.J. Horswill A.R. Homick K.M. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2866-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As described previously for luciferase (21Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), the large domain can be subdivided into three structural subdomains, A, B, and C. Subdomains A and B share a similar topology, each consisting of a β-sheet flanked on both sides by α-helices, whereas subdomain C forms a distorted β-barrel. The C-terminal small domain consists of a mixed α+β structure. Superposition of the large domain with other known adenylation domain structures reveals greatest similarity to PheA, with"
https://openalex.org/W2106954432,"Unstable lipid-rich plaques in atherosclerosis are characterized by the accumulation of macrophage foam cells loaded with cholesterol ester (CE). Although hormone-sensitive lipase and cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) have been proposed to mediate the hydrolysis of CE in macrophages, circumstantial evidence suggests the presence of other enzymes with neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (nCEH) activity. Here we show that the murine orthologue of KIAA1363, designated as neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (NCEH), is a microsomal nCEH with high expression in murine and human macrophages. The effect of various concentrations of NaCl on its nCEH activity resembles that on endogenous nCEH activity of macrophages. RNA silencing of NCEH decreases nCEH activity at least by 50%; conversely, its overexpression inhibits the CE formation in macrophages. Immunohistochemistry reveals that NCEH is expressed in macrophage foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions. These data indicate that NCEH is responsible for a major part of nCEH activity in macrophages and may be a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2074183834,"Mutations that enhance the response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) have revealed components of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway or related small RNA pathways. To explore these small RNA pathways, we screened for Caenorhabditis elegans mutants displaying an enhanced response to exogenous dsRNAs. Here we describe the isolation of mutations in two adjacent, divergently transcribed open reading frames (eri-6 and eri-7) that fail to complement. eri-6 and eri-7 produce separate pre-messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) that are trans-spliced to form a functional mRNA, eri-6/7. Trans-splicing of eri-6/7 is mediated by a direct repeat that flanks the eri-6 gene. Adenosine to inosine editing within untranslated regions of eri-6 and eri-7 pre-mRNAs reveals a double-stranded pre-mRNA intermediate, forming in the nucleus before splicing occurs. The ERI-6/7 protein is a superfamily I helicase that both negatively regulates the exogenous RNAi pathway and functions in an endogenous RNAi pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2063203910,"The human pregnane X receptor (hPXR) regulates the expression of critical drug metabolism enzymes. One of such enzymes, cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), plays critical roles in drug metabolism in hepatocytes that are either quiescent or passing through the cell cycle. It has been well established that the expression of P450, such as CYP3A4, is markedly reduced during liver development or regeneration. Numerous studies have implicated cellular signaling pathways in modulating the functions of nuclear receptors, including hPXR. Here we report that inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) by kenpaullone and roscovitine (two small molecule inhibitors of Cdks that we identified in a screen for compounds that activate hPXR) leads to activation of hPXR-mediated CYP3A4 gene expression in HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells. Consistent with this finding, activation of Cdk2 attenuates the activation of CYP3A4 gene expression. In vitro kinase assays revealed that Cdk2 directly phosphorylates hPXR. A phosphomimetic mutation of a putative Cdk phosphorylation site, Ser350, significantly impairs the function of hPXR, whereas a phosphorylation-deficient mutation confers resistance to Cdk2. Using HepG2 that has been stably transfected with hPXR and the CYP3A4-luciferase reporter, enriched in different phases of the cell cycle, we found that hPXR-mediated CYP3A4 expression is greatly reduced in the S phase. Our results indicate for the first time that Cdk2 negatively regulates the activity of hPXR, and suggest an important role for Cdk2 in regulating hPXR activity and CYP3A4 expression in hepatocytes passing through the cell cycle, such as those in fetal or regenerating adult liver.

Biol. 2008; 12: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, both protein kinase A and protein kinase C have been shown to modulate the activity of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), which is a member of the NR superfamily (6Ding X. Staudinger J.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Ding X. Staudinger J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The human PXR (hPXR) is also referred to as a “steroid and xenobiotic receptor,” or SXR (8Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 9Blumberg B. Sabbagh Jr., W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. van Meter C.M. Ong E.S. Evans R.M.

Zetterstrom R.H. Perlmann T. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). PXR is a key xenobiotic receptor regulating the metabolism and excretion of both xenobiotics and endobiotics by regulating the expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters (1Timsit Y.E. Negishi M. Steroids. 2007; 72: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 11Gong H. Sinz M.W. Feng Y. Chen T. Venkataramanan R. Xie W. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 400: 598-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This regulation is achieved through the binding of hPXR to its xenobiotic response elements present in the promoter regions of the drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. One extremely important hPXR target gene is that of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). CYP3A4 catalyzes the metabolism of over 50% of all clinically prescribed drugs (12Zhou S.F. Curr. Drug Metab. 2008; 9: 310-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Changes in the expression of CYP3A4 can affect drug metabolism, thereby altering the therapeutic or toxicologic response to a drug and possibly causing other adverse drug interactions, an important clinical problem representing a major contributor to morbidity and mortality. A plethora of structurally diverse molecules, including therapeutic drugs, directly bind to and activate hPXR to induce the expression of CYP3A4 (1Timsit Y.E. Negishi M. Steroids. 2007; 72: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Additionally, like other NRs, hPXR can be modulated by cell signaling pathways. Thus, the activity of hPXR is not only regulated by ligands but also by cell signaling pathways, such as the protein kinase pathways. Among the kinases that regulate NRs are the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), which recognize and phosphorylate a serine or threonine residue followed by a proline (13Huang H. Regan K.M. Lou Z. Chen J. Tindall D.J. Science. 2006; 314: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 14Moore N.L. Narayanan R. Weigel N.L. Steroids. 2007; 72: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For example, the activity of Cdk2 is required for the function of the progesterone receptor (PR) (15Narayanan R. Adigun A.A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 264-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and Cdk1 has been shown to phosphorylate and stabilize the androgen receptor (AR) (3Myers J.S. Zhao R. Xu X. Ham A.-J. L. Cortez D. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6685-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The activity of a Cdk requires a cyclin, which serves as a regulatory subunit for the Cdk. Different cyclin-Cdk complexes drive the cell cycle through its different phases (i.e. G1, S, G2, and M) in response to different signals, such as mitogenic signals (16Berthet C. Kaldis P. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For example, during liver regeneration, growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor and epidermal growth factor can drive the cell cycle to pass the G1/S checkpoint and stimulate DNA synthesis (17Fausto N. Campbell J.S. Riehle K.J. Hepatology. 2006; 43: S45-S53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). hPXR and CYP3A4 are primarily expressed in liver and intestine. Hepatocytes in normal adult liver are quiescent (G0 phase) and exhibit only minimal response to mitogens (17Fausto N. Campbell J.S. Riehle K.J. Hepatology. 2006; 43: S45-S53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). However, loss of liver mass because of chemical, traumatic, or infectious liver injuries can trigger a regenerative response in adult livers. Liver regeneration is mainly achieved through driving the quiescent mature adult hepatocytes to re-enter the cell cycle from the G0 phase (18Michalopoulos G.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 213: 286-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 19Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2872) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been reported that CYP3A4 expression is reduced during liver regeneration (20Favre C. Monti J.A. Scapini C. Pellegrino J. Carnovale C.E. Carrillo M.C. J. Hepatol. 1998; 28: 700-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although the mechanism responsible for this reduction is unclear. In addition, there is a high rate of hepatocyte proliferation during liver development (21Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Significant changes in the expression of the cytochrome P450 family, including CYP3A4, occur during liver development (22Hines R.N. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2007; 21: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 23Blake M.J. Gaedigk A. Pearce R.E. Bomgaars L.R. Christensen M.L. Stowe C. James L.P. Wilson J.T. Kearns G.L. Leeder J.S. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 81: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The CYP3A4 level is extremely low in fetal liver, and progressively increases shortly after birth. Reduction in drug metabolism enzymes, including CYP3A4, might have a profound effect on therapeutic efficacy and the risk of adverse drug reactions in the fetus and child, as well as adult patients with regenerating liver because of various liver injuries. However, the reason why hepatocytes passing through the cell cycle have lower CYP3A4 levels than quiescent hepatocytes remains unclear. Moreover, hPXR expression has been detected in prostate cancer (24Chen Y. Tang Y. Wang M.-T. Zeng S. Nie D. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10361-10367Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), endometrial cancer (25Masuyama H. Nakatsukasa H. Takamoto N. Hiramatsu Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and osteosarcoma (26Mensah-Osman E.J. Thomas D.G. Tabb M.M. Larios J.M. Hughes D.P. Giordano T.J. Lizyness M.L. Rae J.M. Blumberg B. Hollenberg P.F. Baker L.H. Cancer. 2007; 109: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for PXR in these actively dividing human cancer cells. Because understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for changes in enzymes involved in drug metabolism is important for designing effective therapies that prevent adverse drug interactions, and because cellular signaling pathways have been implicated in modulation of NR activities, we sought a cell-based screening approach that would identify compounds that activate hPXR-mediated gene expression. By screening a library of known bioactive compounds for small molecule hPXR activators, we identified two Cdk inhibitors, kenpaullone and roscovitine, that strongly activate the hPXR signaling pathway but only weakly bind to hPXR. Consistent with this observation, we show that activation of Cdk2 leads to the attenuation of hPXR activity. In addition, we show that Cdk2 directly phosphorylates hPXR in vitro, and that a phosphomimetic mutation of a putative Cdk phosphorylation site, Ser350, significantly impairs the function of hPXR, whereas a phosphorylation-deficient mutation confers resistance to the inhibitory effect of Cdk2. We also provide evidence that inhibition of hPXR activity occurs in the S phase of the cell cycle. Our data suggest that the activity of hPXR is negatively regulated by Cdk2. To our knowledge, this is the first report that links the activity of hPXR to Cdks and the cell cycle. Materials—HepG2 liver carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). G418 and other cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Anti-V5 was obtained from AbCam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-FLAG M2, anti-β-actin, DMSO, histone H1, thymidine, kenpaullone, rifampicin, and SR-12813 were obtained from Sigma. Roscovitine was purchased from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ). Purified Cdk2-cyclin E complex was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Purified Cdk2-cyclin A complex was obtained from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Purified hPXR protein was obtained from Origene Tech (Rockville, MD). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Alamar blue was purchased from BioSource (Camarillo, CA). Charcoal/dextran-treated FBS was purchased from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Transfection—All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HepG2 was maintained in modified Eagle's minimal essential medium from ATCC with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The pcDNA3-hPXR construct was prepared following a method described previously (27Luo G. Cunningham M. Kim S. Burn T. Lin J. Sinz M. Hamilton G. Rizzo C. Jolley S. Gilbert D. Downey A. Mudra D. Graham R. Carroll K. Xie J. Madan A. Parkinson A. Christ D. Selling B. LeCluyse E. Gan L.-S. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The FLAG-hPXR, a construct expressing a FLAG-tagged hPXR with the FLAG epitope (N-DYKDDDDK-C) fused to the N terminus of hPXR, was prepared by subcloning a fragment containing hPXR into pcDNA3-FLAG. The pcDNA3-FLAG was prepared by annealing oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGGACCA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGGTCCCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCATGGTGGC-3′ and ligating the resulting fragment into HindIII-cleaved pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Plasmids for amino acid substitution mutants of hPXR (FLAG-hPXRS350A and FLAG-hPXRS350D) were generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and appropriately mutated primers. Mutations were verified through nucleotide sequencing. The CYP3A4-luciferase reporter was constructed in pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) following a method described previously (28Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The resulting reporter, designated CYP3A4-luc, contained the following CYP3A4 promoter regions: -7836 to -7208 and -362 to +53. Cyclin A construct was a gift from Dr. Nancy Weigel. V5-cyclin E and V5-Cdk2 constructs were gifts from Dr. Haojie Huang. CMV-Renilla luciferase plasmid was obtained from Promega. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transient transfection, HepG2 cells were first transfected. Forty eight hours post-transfection, the cells were treated with compounds for an additional 24 h before luciferase assay. To select stable clones, the transfected cells were selected in medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 and maintained in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Single colonies were isolated, expanded, and tested for expression of hPXR and response to rifampicin. One of such stable clones, clone 1, was used in this study. hPXR Transactivation Assay—The methodology, as reported previously, was followed with minor modifications (29Zhu Z. Kim S. Chen T. Lin J.H. Bell A. Bryson J. Dubaquie Y. Yan N. Yanchunas J. Xie D. Stoffel R. Sinz M. Dickinson K. J. Biomol. Screen. 2004; 9: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, compounds were added to the wells of 384-well plates containing either transiently transfected or stable HepG2 cells (final DMSO concentration was 0.1%) in phenol red-free medium containing 5% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS and incubated for 6 or 24 h at 37 °C before luciferase assay. DMSO was used as a negative control for compound treatment. In the compound screening (see below for details), rifampicin (10 μm), a well known hPXR agonist, was used as a positive control. The data were expressed as a percentage of activation (% Act = 100% × (compound signal - DMSO signal)/(10 μm rifampicin signal - DMSO signal)). Curve-fitting software (GraphPad Prism 4.0; Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used to generate the curves and to determine the EC50 values. Consistent with data reported previously (30Sinz M. Kim S. Zhu Z. Chen T. Anthony M. Dickinson K. Rodrigues A.D. Curr. Drug Metab. 2006; 7: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), rifampicin had an EC50 of ∼1.3 μm in this assay. In the transient transfection studies, a CMV-Renilla plasmid was co-transfected, and the activities of the reporters were measured using the Dual-glo luciferase kit from Promega, according to the manufacturer's instructions. HepG2 cells in a T-25 tissue culture flask containing ∼3 million cells (70–80% confluency) were transfected with 2.5 μg of total plasmids. To prepare the plasmid mix, 0.3 μg of CMV-Renilla, 1.9 μg of CYP3A4-luc, 0.1 μg of FLAG-hPXR, 0.5 μg of V5-Cdk2, and/or cyclin constructs (V5-cyclin E or cyclin A) were mixed with 9 μl of FuGENE 6 diluted in 300 μl of serum-free medium. Then 250 μl of the mixture was used to transfect HepG2 cells in a T-25 flask. Where Cdk2 or cyclin constructs were not used, a pcDNA3 vector was used to bring the total amounts of plasmid to 3.3 μg. At 24 h post-transfection, 5,000 transfected cells per well (25 μl per well) were seeded into 384-well tissue culture-treated solid white plates. Twenty four hours later, the cells were treated with compounds for another 24 h prior to luciferase assay. Relative luciferase units in transient transfections were determined by normalizing the CYP3A4-luc activity with the activity of the Renilla reporter. In the cell cycle studies, unsynchronized or thymidine-synchronized HepG2 cells (clone 1; 20,000 cells per well, 100 μl per well) were seeded into 96-well tissue culture-treated solid white plates and treated with either DMSO or 10 μm rifampicin prior to luciferase assay. The cell number in each assay well was determined using Alamar blue prior to luciferase assay, as described previously (30Sinz M. Kim S. Zhu Z. Chen T. Anthony M. Dickinson K. Rodrigues A.D. Curr. Drug Metab. 2006; 7: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 10 μl of Alamar blue was added to each well 3 h prior to the measurement of signal. The fluorescence intensity of Alamar blue was determined using an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation 492-nm and emission 590-nm filters. Luminescence signal from the luciferase reporter was subsequently determined from the same plate. Luminescence signals from all luciferase assays were determined using an Envision plate reader. Normalized luciferase units in the cell cycle studies were determined by normalizing the CYP3A4-luc activity with the Alamar blue activity. Screening for Small Molecules That Activate the hPXR Signaling Pathway—Clone 1 cells at 5,000 cells per well (25 μl per well) were seeded into 384-well tissue culture-treated solid white plates 24 h prior to compound treatment. Then 25 nl of compound (10 mm in DMSO) was added to the wells (final concentration was 10 μm), and the plates were incubated for 24 h before luciferase assay. In total, 5,600 compounds representing drugs, drug candidates, known toxic compounds, and other molecules with characterized biological activities from Sigma (1,280 compounds), Microsource (Gaylordsville, CT; 3,200 compounds), and Prestwick (Illkirch, France; 1,120 compounds) were screened. PXR Binding Assay—The time-resolved fluorescence resonance transfer hPXR competitive binding assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) with minor modifications. Briefly, the binding assays were performed in 384-well low volume (20 μl per well) solid black plates with 5 nm GST-hPXR ligand-binding domain, 40 nm fluorescent-labeled hPXR agonist (Fluormore PXR Green, also referred to as a “tracer”), 5 nm terbium-labeled anti-GST antibody, and test compound at a variety of concentrations. DMSO was used as a negative control. A potent hPXR agonist, SR-12813, was used as a positive control. In the reaction mixture, GST-hPXR forms a complex with the terbium-labeled anti-GST antibody and the tracer. Excitation of terbium (the donor) using a 340-nm excitation filter results in energy transfer to the fluorophore of the tracer. This energy transfer is detected by an increase in the fluorescence emission of the tracer at 520 nm and a decrease in the fluorescence emission of terbium at 495 nm. The FRET ratio was calculated by dividing the emission signal at 520 nm by the emission signal at 495 nm. A competitor compound such as SR-12813 replaces the tracer from the complex and decreases the FRET ratio accordingly. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min before measuring the fluorescent emission of each well at 495 and 520 nm using a 340-nm excitation filter, 100-μs delay time, and 200-μs integration time, on a PHERAStar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Durham, NC). The curve-fitting software GraphPad Prism 4.0 was used to generate the curves and determine the IC50 values. SR-12813 has an IC50 of 49 nm in this assay. In Vitro Cdk Kinase Assay—In the in vitro kinase assays, 20 units of Cdk2/cyclin A or 20 ng of Cdk2/cyclin E were used per reaction. Kinase assays were performed in 25-μl reactions with ∼1 μg of substrate protein, 0.5 μmol/liter of cold ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). GST was expressed and purified using pGex-4T-1 (GE Healthcare) in Escherichia coli BL21. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then loaded to SDS-PAGE. To visualize the amount of the samples used, the gel was stained using SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen). Afterward, the stained gel was desiccated using the Labconco gel dryer (Labconco, Kansas City, MO). The dried gel was then subjected to overnight exposure in the Storage Phosphor Screen (GE Healthcare). Phosphorimages were obtained using the Storm scanner (GE Healthcare). Western Blotting Analysis—The cells were rinsed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Protein levels were determined using a NanoDrop Spectrometer (Fisher). Equal amounts of lysates were loaded into each lane on an SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane prior to being analyzed using Western blotting. Western blotting was performed as described previously (31Chen T. Cho R.W. Stork P.J.S. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 213-218PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analysis—Clone 1 cells were plated in modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. To synchronize the cells at the beginning of the S phase, we followed methodology using a high concentration of thymidine as reported previously by others (32Whitfield M.L. Zheng L.-X. Baldwin A. Ohta T. Hurt M.M. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4188-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 33Whitfield M.L. Sherlock G. Saldanha A.J. Murray J.I. Ball C.A. Alexander K.E.

Two synchronization protocols were used, and similar results were obtained. In the first protocol, the cells were treated for 48 h with 2 mm thymidine. In the second protocol, the cells were treated for 24 h with 2 mm thymidine, released for 6 h by washing out the thymidine, and then blocked again with 2 mm thymidine for 48 h. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and resuspended in culture medium (1 × 106/ml), and either processed for fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis or plated into assay plates and treated with either DMSO or 10 μm of rifampicin for 6 h prior to luciferase assays or protein level determination. Cell cycle distribution was determined using flow cytometry. FACS analysis was performed at the time of harvesting for various treatments. FACS profiles are shown. Because the two blocking protocols produced similar results, we only present data generated using the first protocol in this study. Inhibition of Cdks Leads to Activation of hPXR-mediated Gene Expression—Small molecule activators of the hPXR signaling pathway were sought using a cell-based screening assay based on the rationale that hPXR can be activated either by agonists or by modulators of signaling pathways that cross-talk with the hPXR signaling pathway. A total of 5,600 compounds, including drugs, drug candidates, known toxic compounds, and other molecules with characterized biological activities, were tested. The screen was carried out in HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells stably transfected with hPXR (pcDNA3-hPXR) and CYP3A4-luc, in which the expression of luciferase was controlled by the hPXR-regulated CYP3A4 promoter. One of such stable clones, clone 1, was used in this study. The HepG2 cell line has been commonly used to study hPXR regulation. Although endogenous hPXR in HepG2 is undetectable using Western blotting, stable expression of hPXR from pcDNA3-hPXR in clone 1 was confirmed using Western blotting (data not shown). Clone 1 cells were plated into 384-well plates, incubated with compounds 24 h post-plating, and assayed for luciferase activity at 24 h after compound treatment. As shown for clone 1 in Fig. 1A, rifampicin, an hPXR agonist used as a positive control in the screen, induces CYP3A4 promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner (with an EC50 of 1.3 μm). Two Cdk inhibitors, kenpaullone and roscovitine, strongly activated the CYP3A4 promoter, with an EC50 of 824 and 197 nm for kenpaullone and roscovitine, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C, and Table 1).TABLE 1Comparison of compound activities from various assaysCompoundEC50 (hPXR reporter assay)IC50 (hPXR binding assay)IC50 (Cdk inhibition) (34Zaharevitz D.W.

Compounds that involve both direct hPXR binding and signal cross-talk do exist. Forskolin is such a compound that not only binds to hPXR but also activates protein kinase A, which in turn phosphorylates and potentiates hPXR activation (6Ding X. Staudinger J.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Forskolin was identified as a strong hPXR activator in our screen (data not shown). To elucidate the mechanism of these Cdk inhibitors on activating hPXR, we first asked whether these compounds bind to hPXR. Fig. 2 shows the various binding activities of SR-12813, kenpaullone, and roscovitine in a competitive binding assay (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Table 1 compares the activity of these compounds in the cell-based reporter assay versus the binding assay. SR-12813, a potent hPXR agonist, strongly binds to hPXR ligand-binding domain (IC50 = 49 nm). The binding affinity of SR-12813 to hPXR in the binding assay is consistent with its activity in the reporter assay (EC50 = 87 nm). Although roscovitine binds to the hPXR ligand-binding domain with moderate affinity (IC50 = 3,410 nm), kenpaullone is a much weaker hPXR binder (IC50 = 39,270 nm). However, both kenpaullone and roscovitine activated hPXR in the cell-based reporter assay with moderate potency (EC50 = 824 and 197 nm, respectively). Although the ratio of IC50 (binding) to EC50 (cell-based) for SR-12813 is ∼0.6, the ratio for kenpaullone and roscovitine is 47.7 and 17.3, respectively. Therefore, Cdk inhibitors kenpaullone and roscovitine activate PXR with moderate potency but bind to hPXR with lower affinity. These findings suggest that direct hPXR binding is not entirely responsible for the activation of hPXR by the Cdk inhibitors and led us to hypothesize that inhibition of the Cdk pathway is involved in the re"
https://openalex.org/W2106760703,"Mammary gland homeostasis and the lactation-to-involution switch are regulated by serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)). Mammary epithelial tight junctions are physiological targets of 5-HT, and their disruption marks an early stage of mammary gland involution. In these studies, we have identified signal transduction mechanism employed by 5-HT during regulation of mammary gland transepithelial resistance. Transepithelial electrical resistance and tight junction protein architecture were studied in cultures of MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells. Serotonin had biphasic effects on mammary epithelial resistance. At lower concentrations and earlier time points, 5-HT potentiated epithelial transmembrane resistance, whereas at higher concentrations and later time points, 5-HT decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and disrupted tight junctions. Both the early and delayed actions of 5-HT were mediated by the 5-HT7 receptor through activation of G(s)/cAMP. 5-HT induced the activities of both protein kinase A and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase abrogated 5-HT-induced disruption of mammary epithelial tight junctions (the delayed effect). In contrast, inhibition of protein kinase A prevented the increased epithelial resistance in response to 5-HT (the transient effect). These studies imply an integrated set of mechanisms whereby transient, modest activation of 5-HT7 promotes tight junction integrity, and sustained 5-HT7 activation drives involution by disrupting tight junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2073368842,"Very massive stars shed much of their mass in violent precursor eruptions as luminous blue variables (LBVs) before reaching their most likely end as supernovae, but the cause of LBV eruptions is unknown. The nineteenth-century eruption of eta Carinae, the prototype of these events, ejected about 12 solar masses at speeds of 650 km s(-1), with a kinetic energy of almost 10(50) erg (ref. 4). Some faster material with speeds up to 1,000-2,000 km s(-1) had previously been reported but its full distribution was unknown. Here I report observations of much faster material with speeds up to 3,500-6,000 km s(-1), reaching farther from the star than the fastest material in previous reports. This fast material roughly doubles the kinetic energy of the nineteenth-century event and suggests that it released a blast wave now propagating ahead of the massive ejecta. As a result, eta Carinae's outer shell now mimics a low-energy supernova remnant. The eruption has usually been discussed in terms of an extreme wind driven by the star's luminosity, but the fast material reported here indicates that it may have been powered by a deep-seated explosion rivalling a supernova, perhaps triggered by the pulsational pair instability. This may alter interpretations of similar events seen in other galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W2141405640,"Hepsin, a cell surface protease, is widely reported to be overexpressed in more than 90% of human prostate tumors. Hepsin expression correlates with tumor progression, making it a significant marker and target for prostate cancer. Recently, it was reported that in a prostate cancer mouse model, hepsin up-regulation in tumor tissue promotes progression and metastasis. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain largely uncharacterized. Hepsin transgenic mice displayed reduced laminin-332 (Ln-332) expression in prostate tumors. This is an intriguing cue, since proteolytic processing of extracellular matrix macromolecules, such as Ln-332, is believed to be involved in cancer progression, and Ln-332 expression is lost during human prostate cancer progression. In this study, we provide the first direct evidence that hepsin cleaves Ln-332. Cleavage is specific, since it is both inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by a hepsin inhibitor (Kunitz domain-1) and does not occur when catalytically inactive hepsin is used. By Western blotting and mass spectrometry, we determined that hepsin cleaves the β3 chain of Ln-332. N-terminal sequencing identified the cleavage site at β3 Arg245, in a sequence context (SQLR245↓LQGSCFC) conserved among species and in remarkable agreement with reported consensus target sequences for hepsin activity. In vitro cell migration assays showed that hepsin-cleaved Ln-332 enhanced motility of DU145 prostate cancer cells, which was inhibited by Kunitz domain-1. Further, hepsin-overexpressing LNCaP prostate cancer cells also exhibited increased migration on Ln-332. Direct cleavage of Ln-332 may be one mechanism by which hepsin promotes prostate tumor progression and metastasis, possibly by up-regulating prostate cancer cell motility.

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States; according to the American Cancer Society, 186,320 new prostate cancer cases and 28,660 deaths from prostate cancer are projected to occur in 2008 (1Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Hao Y. Xu J. Murray T. Thun M.J. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2008; 58: 71-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (10213) Google Scholar). This high rate of mortality is largely due to metastasis of the primary tumor (2Mundy G.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 584-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). For metastasis to occur, primary tumor cells must breach the basement membrane (BM) 3The abbreviations used are: BM, basement membrane; ECM, extracellular matrix; EGR-cmk, Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone; KD1, Kunitz domain-1; Ln, laminin; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase(s); pAb, polyclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGR-hepsin, EGR-cmk-inactivated hepsin; Ctrl-hepsin, control hepsin for EGR-hepsin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. by degrading extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules to initiate the invasion process (3Gupta G.P. Massague J. Cell. 2006; 127: 679-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar). Escaped tumor cells interact with neighboring ECM molecules to promote this activity. This interaction sometimes promotes remodeling of the ECM to create a more conducive environment for tumor cell migration and invasion and thereby aids in cancer progression (4Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). The remodeling of certain ECM molecules has been reported to occur as a direct result of protease processing, which results in increased tumor cell migration and invasion (5Woodward J.K. Holen I. Coleman R.E. Buttle D.J. Bone. 2007; 41: 912-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Noel A. Gilles C. Bajou K. Devy L. Kebers F. Lewalle J.M. Maquoi E. Munaut C. Remacle A. Foidart J.M.

Laminin-332 (Ln-332; previously known as laminin-5), an ECM molecule, is an important component of BM (8Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). It is a trimeric glycoprotein consisting of disulfide-bonded subunits: α3, β3, and γ2 polypeptide chains (9Aumailley M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Carter W.G. Deutzmann R. Edgar D. Ekblom P. Engel J. Engvall E. Hohenester E. Jones J.C. Kleinman H.K. Marinkovich M.P. Martin G.R. Mayer U. Meneguzzi G. Miner J.H. Miyazaki K.

Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The importance of Ln-332 in BM assembly was established by the discovery of the occurrence of a lethal skin blistering disorder, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, which is due to mutation in any of the three chains of Ln-332 (10Meneguzzi G. Marinkovich M.P. Aberdam D. Pisani A. Burgeson R. Ortonne J.P. Exp. Dermatol. 1992; 1: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Ln-332 also plays an important role in development, wound healing, and tumorigenesis (11Ryan M.C. Christiano A.M. Engvall E. Wewer U.M. Miner J.H. Sanes J.R. Burgeson R.E. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Ln-332 is overexpressed in several tumor types, such as esophageal, cutaneous, oral, laryngeal, colon, tracheal, and cervical cancers (12Marinkovich M.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); however, interestingly, there is loss of Ln-332 in prostate cancer (13Hao J. Jackson L. Calaluce R. McDaniel K. Dalkin B.L.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 366-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), sometimes as a means of motility regulation of cells (18Hintermann E. Quaranta V. Matrix. Biol. 2004; 23: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of Ln-332 γ2 chain by several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been reported to increase cell migration; our laboratory previously reported Ln-332 γ2 cleavage by MMP2 and MT1-MMP (19Koshikawa N.

The β3 chain of Ln-332, believed to be relatively resistant to proteolytic processing, has also been reported to be processed by both MT1-MMP (26Udayakumar T.S. Chen M.L. Bair E.L. Von Bredow D.C. Cress A.E. Nagle R.B. Bowden G.T. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2292-2299PubMed Google Scholar) and matrilysin (27Remy L. Trespeuch C. Bachy S. Scoazec J.Y. Rousselle P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11228-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Another study reported that β3 chain of Ln-332 is cleaved at its N terminus by endogenous proteinase(s) in human keratinocytes and other cell lines (28Nakashima Y. Kariya Y. Yasuda C. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 138: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); however, the authors did not indicate the specific protease involved in the cleavage. Clearly, these studies have established that proteolytic processing of Ln-332 occurs physiologically and can alter cellular behavior, at least in terms of motility. During the progression of prostate cancer, various genetic and epigenetic changes occur (29Morrissey C. True L.D. Roudier M.P. Coleman I.M. Hawley S. Nelson P.S. Coleman R. Wang Y.C. Corey E.

Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 811-815PubMed Google Scholar), as well as up-regulation or overexpression of various genes, has been reported (32Jenkins R.B. Qian J. Lieber M.M. Bostwick D.G.

Anticancer Ther. 2008; 8: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One of the genes found to be up-regulated in more than 90% of human prostate cancer cases is the cell surface protease, hepsin (35Landers K.A. Burger M.J. Tebay M.A. Purdie D.M. Scells B. Samaratunga H. Lavin M.F. Gardiner R.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 114: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 36Stephan C. Yousef G.M. Scorilas A. Jung K. Jung M. Kristiansen G. Hauptmann S. Kishi T. Nakamura T. Loening S.A. Diamandis E.P. J. Urol. 2004; 171: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, a prostate cancer mouse model demonstrated that hepsin overexpression causes disorganization of BM and promotes prostate cancer progression and metastasis (37Klezovitch O. Chevillet J. Mirosevich J. Roberts R.L. Matusik R.J. Vasioukhin V. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The mechanism involved in this disorganization of BM was not revealed; however, the authors did report that prostate tissues from hepsin-overexpressing mice exhibited weaker immunohistochemical staining of Ln-332 compared with wild type mice. Decreased staining of Ln-332 in hepsin-overexpressing mice led us to hypothesize that Ln-332 is processed by hepsin, which may be a key step in the progression of prostate cancer. Hepsin is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family. The physiological function of hepsin remains unclear (38Wu Q. Parry G. Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 5052-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have identified blood coagulation factors as substrates of hepsin (39Kazama Y. Hamamoto T. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 66-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Prohepatocyte growth factor and prourokinase-type plasminogen activator are also substrates for hepsin (40Moran P. Li W. Fan B. Vij R. Eigenbrot C. Kirchhofer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30439-30446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 41Kirchhofer D. Peek M. Lipari M.T. Billeci K. Fan B. Moran P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1945-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The role of hepsin in prostate cancer remains of great interest, since it overexpressed in more than 90% of human prostate cancer, and its expression correlates with progression of the disease (42Xuan J.A. Schneider D. Toy P. Lin R. Newton A. Zhu Y. Finster S. Vogel D. Mintzer B. Dinter H. Light D. Parry R. Polokoff M. Whitlow M. Wu Q. Parry G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3611-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In summary, a role for either Ln-332 or hepsin in prostate cancer progression is supported by several studies. However, the roles of these two molecules have been studied separately, and they have not been previously linked to date. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that hepsin cleaves Ln-332. Using Western blot analysis and mass spectrometry, we identified that cleavage occurs specifically in the β3 chain. Further, N-terminal sequencing identified the hepsin cleavage site between the Arg245 and Leu246 residues in the β3 chain. Cleavage of Ln-332 was inhibited by a known hepsin inhibitor (KD1) and did not occur in the presence of catalytically inactive hepsin, confirming specificity. We also report increased migration of DU145 prostate cancer cells on hepsin-cleaved Ln-332, which was also inhibited in the presence of KD1. Similarly, we show that hepsin-overexpressing LNCaP-34 cells exhibit enhanced motility on Ln-332, compared with low hepsin-expressing LNCaP-17 cells. This study suggests a physiological role for hepsin in proteolytic cleavage of Ln-332 and gives new insight into possible mechanisms for hepsin in prostate cancer progression. Cell Culture—Prostate cancer cell line DU145 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and 804G bladder squamous cell carcinoma cells (previously described by Falk-Marzillier et al. (43Falk-Marzillier J. Domanico S.Z. Pelletier A. Mullen L. Quaranta V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini, Irvine, CA) and 1% glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics (Invitrogen) in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. LNCaP-17 (low hepsin-expressing) and LNCaP-34 (hepsin-overexpressing) prostrate cancer cells were created as previously described by Moran et al. (40Moran P. Li W. Fan B. Vij R. Eigenbrot C. Kirchhofer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30439-30446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen), 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), and 1% glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin and incubated with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Purification of Rat Ln-332—Rat Ln-332 was purified from spent medium of 804G bladder squamous cell carcinoma cells. Briefly, 804G cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in a 150-mm dish. Cells were then washed with PBS twice and cultured in serum-free conditioned medium for 2 days in roller bottles. The serum-free conditioned medium was collected and concentrated by ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.005% Brij-35 (TNB buffer). The concentrated serum-free conditioned medium was then used for immunoaffinity chromatography. The Protein A-Sepharose column (0.8 × 4.0 cm; Bio-Rad) chemically conjugated with nonfunctional Ln-332 mouse antibody, TR-1 (44Plopper G. Falk-Marzillier J. Glaser S. Fitchmun M. Giannelli G. Romano T. Jones J.C. Quaranta V. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1965-1973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was equilibrated with TNB buffer at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. The concentrated and dialyzed sample was applied to the TR1 column. The column was then washed with TNB, and absorbed Ln-332 was eluted with 10 ml of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.5. The eluted fractions were neutralized by 300 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then 1% CHAPS was added to each fraction. Cleavage of Ln-332—The cleavage of rat Ln-332 was studied with human recombinant hepsin, consisting of the entire extracellular domain (40Moran P. Li W. Fan B. Vij R. Eigenbrot C. Kirchhofer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30439-30446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To study the cleavage of Ln-332 by hepsin, purified rat Ln-332 (0.2 μm) was incubated with the recombinant protease domain of hepsin (at both 0.13 and 1.3 μm) and reaction buffer containing 250 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. For the time course experiment, Ln-332 (0.8 μm) was incubated with hepsin (5.2 μm) and reaction buffer containing 250 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 0, 2, and 6 h at 37 °C. After incubation, hepsin and Ln-332 reaction mixture was electrophoresed on 4–12% precast SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel under reducing/nonreducing (as indicated) conditions and then stained with SimplyBlue™ Safe Coomassie Blue stain (Invitrogen). A standard marker (identified as M in the figures; Precision Plus™ protein dual color standard; Bio-Rad) was also run for comparison. Western blot analysis was performed after transferring the untreated and treated protein on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), from reducing gel. Polyclonal antibody (pAb; 1:500) against the C terminus of Ln-332 β3 chain (sc-20775; H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)) and secondary anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase monoclonal antibody (1:5000; GE Healthcare) were used for Western blot. Protein bands were visualized with the ECL+ plus system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mass Spectrometry—The cleaved product of Ln-332 by hepsin was further identified using mass spectrometry analysis performed by the Mass Spectrometry Research Center at Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN). After digestion, the proteins in the reaction mixture were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and visualized using Coomassie Blue stain. The protein bands of interest were excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then equilibrated in 100 mm NH4HCO3, reduced with 3 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C for 15 min. Alkylation was carried out with iodoacetamide (6 mm in 100 mm NH4HCO3 for 15 min). After destaining, the gel slices were dehydrated with 50% acetonitrile in 50 mm NH4HCO3, followed by 100% acetonitrile. Gel slices were rehydrated with 15 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 containing 0.01 μg/μl modified trypsin. Trypsin digestion was performed for 2 h at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted with 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and reconstituted in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After desalting, peptides were concentrated into 2 μl of 60% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid using ZipTipC18 pipette tips. For the preparation of sample for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), 0.4 μl of the sample was applied to a target plate and overlaid with 0.4 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (10 mg/ml in 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). MALDITOF MS and tandem TOF/TOF MS/MS were performed using a Voyager 4700 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). TOF/TOF fragmentation spectra were acquired in a data-dependent fashion based on the MALDI-TOF peptide mass map for the protein. Both types of mass spectral data were collectively used to examine the protein data bases to generate statistically significant candidate identification using GPS Explorer software (Applied Biosystems) running the MASCOT data base search algorithm (Matrix Science). Searches were performed against the SWISS PROT and the NCBI databases. Edman Degradation Sequencing—NH2-terminal sequencing of the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane containing the cleaved protein was carried out on an Applied Biosystems Procise® 494 cLC protein sequencer at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (New Haven, CT). Enzyme Inhibition Assay—We used hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1-derived Kunitz domain inhibitor (KD1) to inhibit hepsin activity (45Shia S. Stamos J. Kirchhofer D. Fan B. Wu J. Corpuz R.T. Santell L. Lazarus R.A. Eigenbrot C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1335-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As described above under “Cleavage of Ln-332,” purified rat Ln-332 (0.2 μm) was incubated alone or with recombinant hepsin (1.3 μm) and reaction buffer with or without KD1 inhibitor (5.6 or 11.2 μm) at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on 4–12% precast gradient gel under reducing conditions and then stained with Coomassie Blue. Inactivation of Hepsin Enzymatic Activity by Glu-Gly-Arg Chloromethyl Ketone (EGR-cmk)—Purified recombinant hepsin as described (40Moran P. Li W. Fan B. Vij R. Eigenbrot C. Kirchhofer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30439-30446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was incubated either with 10-fold molar excess of an irreversible covalent inhibitor, EGR-cmk (Hematological Technologies, Essex Junction, VT) or buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl (for Ctrl-hepsin) for 3 h at room temperature. EGR-cmk-inactivated hepsin (EGR-hepsin) complex was separated from unreacted EGR-cmk by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex S-200 column (GE Healthcare Inc.) with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. Ctrl-hepsin was also subjected to size exclusion chromatographic purification as described above. Relative to Ctrl-hepsin, EGR-hepsin had lost >99% of its catalytic activity, as assessed by the rate of substrate hydrolysis with a small synthetic substrate, S2366 (Diapharma, West Chester, OH). EGR-hepsin Assay—EGR-hepsin was used to further examine the specificity of Ln-332 cleavage by hepsin. As with earlier assays, 0.2 μm purified rat Ln-332 was incubated with reaction buffer alone or with recombinant EGR-hepsin (1.3 μm), Ctrl-hepsin (1.3 μm), or the recombinant hepsin (1.3 μm) used for the initial cleavage reactions at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on 4–12% precast gradient gel under reducing conditions and then stained with Coomassie Blue. Transwell Migration Assays—Cell migration assays were performed using 8.0-μm pore size Transwell™ permeable supports (Corning Costar, Lowell, MA). The undersides of the filters were coated with either untreated or hepsin-treated rat Ln-332 (1 μg/ml), Ln-332 coincubated with hepsin and KD1, PBS, hepsin (1.3 μm), or KD1 (5.6 μm) overnight at 4 °C. Transwells were then blocked with 5% milk in PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 for 1 h. DU145 or LNCaP cells were trypsinized, resuspended in serum-free medium, and washed twice with serum-free medium, and cells (20,000 or 50,000, respectively) were seeded in the upper chamber of inserts. After 5 h (DU145) or 24 h (LNCaP) incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, cells remaining on the upper filter were scraped off gently using a cotton swab, and the inserts were gently washed with PBS. Those cells that migrated to the lower chamber were fixed with 400 μl of fixation solution (Hema-3® stain kit, catalog number 122-911; Fisher) for 10 min, stained with 400 μl of staining solution for 20 min, and imaged with a Zeiss LSM-510 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss). Five representative images (×10 magnification) were randomly captured for each insert and used to manually count the number of cells present. Results are presented as mean number of cells per field ± S.D. Student's t tests (α = 0.05) were performed on final data to test significance of effects. Cell-mediated Cleavage of Ln-332—LNCaP-17 (low hepsin-expressing) or LNCaP-34 (hepsin-overexpressing) cells (9.0 × 104) in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 were incubated with either 100 μg/ml Ln-332 or PBS for 12 h at 37 °C. After 12 h, Ln-332 solution with medium and cells was collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 rpm, and supernatant was collected. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed under reducing conditions, and protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. A pAb against the C terminus of Ln-332 β3 chain (1:200; sc-20775; H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the secondary anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:5000) was used for visualization in Western blot. Protein bands were visualized with the ECL+ plus system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Processing of Ln-332 by Hepsin—To determine whether hepsin cleaves Ln-332, purified rat Ln-332 was incubated with recombinant hepsin at different concentrations in reaction buffer for 1.5 h with an enzyme/substrate (i.e. hepsin/Ln-332) molar ratio of 1.0:1.5 and 1.0:0.15 (latter ratio used in all follow-up experiments), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After incubation, protein samples were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1A). We observed a unique band at ∼100 kDa in the lanes containing Ln-332 incubated with hepsin at both concentrations tested (solid arrow; lanes 2 and 3) but not in untreated samples (lane 1). The intensity of the cleaved band correlated with increasing hepsin concentration (lane 3). Additionally, lanes 2 and 3 produced a unique band at ∼30 kDa (open arrow), which corresponds to the protease domain of hepsin. Lane 4, which includes hepsin alone, also revealed this ∼30 kDa band. Ln-332, both in the absence and presence of hepsin, was also electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions (supplemental Fig. 1). Under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, Ln-332 appeared proteolytically degraded by hepsin on SDS-PAGE; however, under nonreducing conditions, the bands appeared less defined, which was due to the absence of the reducing agent (dithiothreitol). This electrophoretic behavior under nonreducing conditions is consistent with the presence of disulfide bonds between the Ln-332 chains, as mentioned in the Introduction. In a time course experiment, we incubated Ln-332 and hepsin in reaction buffer for 0, 2, or 6 h (Fig. 1B). As expected, no cleavage product of Ln-332 was observed at 0 h (lane 2), whereas the intensity of the ∼100 kDa band increased from 2 h (lane 4) to 6 h(lane 6) (closed arrow). As shown in Fig. 1B, those treatments including hepsin (lanes 2, 4, and 6) also showed the ∼30 kDa hepsin band (open arrow). These results confirmed that untreated Ln-332 resolved as bands corresponding to α3 (190 kDa), β3 (145 kDa), and γ2 chains (155 and 80 kDa) and that no cleavage band was detectable in the absence of hepsin (lanes 1, 3, and 5). These results suggest that the ∼100 kDa band is a unique product of hepsin cleavage. Ln-332 Is Specifically Cleaved by Hepsin—In order to confirm that Ln-332 was cleaved by hepsin specifically and not by another contamination protease, we performed an enzyme inhibition assay. We added a specific inhibitor of hepsin, KD1, in the cleavage reaction with Ln-332 and hepsin during incubation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Hepsin-treated Ln-332, as expected, contained a ∼100 kDa band (solid arrow; lane 2) not present in untreated Ln-332 (lane 1). However, the addition of the hepsin inhibitor KD1 nearly abolished this band (lanes 3 and 4). Those lanes with hepsin treatment (lanes 2–4) again revealed ∼30 kDa protease domain bands (open arrow). Additionally, those treatments with KD1 inhibitor (lanes 3 and 4) produced a band at ∼10 kDa (double arrow). This experiment indicates that the ∼100 kDa band is a product of cleavage of Ln-332 by hepsin. Inactive Hepsin Does Not Cle"

Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17381-17384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High levels of PAF are responsible for a variety of human diseases such as inflammation, asthma, necrotizing enterocolitis, and sepsis (2Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 419-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The enzyme PAF-AH (EC 3.1.1.47) was first identified from the plasma by its ability to hydrolyze and therefore inactivate PAF (3Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Le Trong H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The enzyme plasma PAF-AH has been classified as group VIIA phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (4Schaloske R.H. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 1246-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), and it hydrolyzes the ester bond at the sn-2 position of phospholipid substrates with a short sn-2 chain. In addition to its role in reducing PAF levels, PAF-AH functions by hydrolyzing other pro-inflammatory agents, such as oxidized lipids of LDL particles (5Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11095-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Davis B. Koster G. Douet L.J. Scigelova M. Woffendin G. Ward J.M. Smith A. Humphries J. Burnand K.G.

Many of these oxidized phospholipids have an oxidatively fragmented sn-2 chain that would orient away from the hydrophobic portion of an LDL particle. These oxidized phospholipid species are present at elevated levels at atherogenic lesions, and the PAF-AH hydrolysis of these species has attracted considerable attention recently as a potential therapeutic target (6Davis B. Koster G. Douet L.J. Scigelova M. Woffendin G. Ward J.M. Smith A. Humphries J. Burnand K.G. Macphee C.H. Postle A.D. J. Biol.

Physiologically, plasma PAF-AH is associated to both LDL and HDL particles and therefore functions on the lipid-aqueous interface and can be considered a peripheral membrane protein. Another generally used name for plasma PAF-AH is lipoprotein-associated PLA2 (7Macphee C.H. Nelson J.J. Eur. Heart J. 2005; 26: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies have shown that although PAF-AH binds to interfaces, such as LDL particles and vesicles, this binding is not necessary for catalysis (11Min J.H. Jain M.K. Wilder C. Paul L. Apitz-Castro R. Aspleaf D.C. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12935-12942Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Min J.H. Wilder C. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Paul L. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4539-4549Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the 14-kDa secreted PLA2 enzymes that are allosterically activated upon interface binding (13Gelb M.H. Min J.H. Jain M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The plasma PAF-AH and the homologous (42% identity) intracellular type II PAF-AH (also known as group VIIB PLA2) enzymes are calcium-independent and contain a GXSXG motif that is characteristic of neutral lipases and serine esterases (14Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Structurally distinct from the 44-kDa plasma PAF-AH and type II PAF-AH enzymes is a 26-kDa intracellular brain catalytic domain that has been designated type I PAF-AH or more commonly PAF-AH-Ib (15Arai H. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the structure of PAF-AH-Ib has been reported (16Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda U. Serre L.

Neuron. 2004; 44: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), there is no sequence homology to the other PAF-AH enzymes. Additionally, the PAF-AH-Ib enzyme has been suggested to have a physiological function other than as a true PAF-AH enzyme (18Derewenda Z.S. Colloids Surfaces B: Biointerfaces. 2002; 26: 31-35Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 19Epstein, T. M. (2005) Structural and Kinetic Studies of Two Enzymes Catalyzing Phospholipase A2 Activity. Ph.D. thesis, University of Delaware, Newark, DEGoogle Scholar). Although a structure has been determined for a distantly related lipase from Streptomyces exfoliatus (20Wei Y. Swenson L. Castro C.

Structure. 1998; 6: 511-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the extent of sequence overlap between this enzyme and the mammalian plasma PAF-AH enzyme is limited to 19% identity over a subset of 228 aligned residues. Hence, a crystal structure of a mammalian PAF-AH was required to understand the relationship between structure and function. Following identification of the enzyme in the plasma, it had been subjected to extensive biochemical characterization, including the determination of the limits of N- and C-terminal truncations that preserve native functions (14Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol.

Here, we report a 1.5-Å ligand-free crystal structure and a 2.1-Å diethyl phosphoryl (DEP) complex crystal structure of a 43.4-kDa construct (residues 47–429) of PAF-AH. This construct represents a form of the enzyme with native-like enzyme activity (14Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) toward the substrate PAF, as well as native-like LDL binding properties (12Min J.H. Wilder C. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Paul L. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4539-4549Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Protein Preparation and Crystallization—We obtained 160 mg of pure human plasma PAF-AH (PAFase, residues 47–429, NCBI accession Q13093) overexpressed from Escherichia coli from ICOS Corporation. Details of the protein preparation and initial crystallization of the ligand-free form of human PAF-AH have been reported (21Samanta, U., Wilder, C., and Bahnson, B. J. (2008) Protein Peptide Lett., in pressGoogle Scholar) and will be summarized briefly. Prior to crystallization, PAF-AH samples were suspended in appropriate buffer/detergent solutions (see below). PAF-AH was assayed for kinetic activity using the ester substrate p-nitrophenyl acetate, and the reaction was followed by UV absorbance at 402 nm (ϵ402 nm = 17,700 m-1cm-1). Ligand-free PAF-AH Crystals—Our best crystals of ligand-free PAF-AH were obtained at 20 °C starting from a protein solution at 4 mg/ml that contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, 6 mm sodium citrate, 3% (w/v) sucrose, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 27 mmn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 0.04% (w/v) Pluronic F68, 0.002% (w/v) Tween 80, pH 6.7. The crystallization reservoir solution contained 98.5 mm MOPS buffer, pH 6.6, 44.3% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4, 0.394 m Li2SO4, 0.985 m sodium acetate, and 1.48% (v/v) 1,4-butanediol. Aliquots of 1.5 μl of protein and crystallization solutions were mixed to form each hanging drop, and protein crystals formed in 3–4 weeks. To obtain phase information, the ligand-free crystals of PAF-AH were directly soaked with MeHgCl by adding a small grain of solid powder to the hanging drop and incubating it in the drop for 24 h. Derivative crystals were then flash cooled in liquid nitrogen, stored, and transported to the synchrotron for data collection. Paraoxon Inhibited PAF-AH—PAF-AH protein received from ICOS Corp. was exchanged with the detergent Triton DF16 (0.01% w/v) using a Q-Sepharose column as described previously (21Samanta, U., Wilder, C., and Bahnson, B. J. (2008) Protein Peptide Lett., in pressGoogle Scholar). The protein was then incubated overnight with the organophosphate compound paraoxon (ChemService) to covalently react with the enzyme active site Ser273. Protein was dialyzed to remove salt and excess paraoxon, and finally it was assayed to confirm a complete loss of enzyme activity. The protein sample was concentrated by centrifugal concentration using a Centricon 30 membrane (Millipore) at slow speed (2000 rpm) to avoid aggregation and precipitation. The protein component contained 3 mg/ml protein, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 27 mmn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The crystallization solution contained 41% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4, 400 mm Li2SO4, 800 mm sodium formate, pH 7.0, 1.24% (w/v) 1,4-butanediol. Aliquots of 1.5 μl of the protein and crystallization solutions were mixed and set as hanging drops. The crystals grew (150 × 120 × 90 μm) within 2 weeks. X-ray Data Collection—Native and mercury-derivative data sets were collected at synchrotron beamlines using crystals frozen in liquid nitrogen; additional cryo-protectant was not required. The single- and multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion data sets were collected at Beamline 19ID of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago, IL). The data sets for native ligand-free and paraoxon inhibited crystals were collected at Beamline X29 of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY). The diffraction data were indexed and processed using the program HKL2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). Crystal Structure Solution—A single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set to a resolution of 2.71 Å of a MeHgCl derivative of PAF-AH was used to phase the structure. Eight mercury sites in the crystallographic asymmetric unit were identified and used to generate initial phases using the programs SOLVE and RESOLVE (23Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Two subunits of PAF-AH are in the asymmetric unit. A noncrystallographic symmetry axis was identified from six of the mercury sites, with three similar sites per protein subunit. The noncrystallographic symmetry axis was used to improve initial electron density maps using the CCP4 suite program Dm (24CCP4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). These medium resolution electron density maps, which contained regions of well defined α-helices and β-sheets, allowed the initial model building of roughly half the 766 amino acids/asymmetric unit with the program COOT (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar). The partial model was then refined in the nonisomorphous native data set using data to a resolution of 2.6 Å. The partial model was next used as initial phases together with the native data set to a resolution of 1.5 Å for the automated program ARP/wARP (26Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). Within 60 cycles, the program had traced and auto-built side chains for 97% of the model. Refinement was initially carried out with the program REFMAC5 (24CCP4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) and was finished using the program SHELXL (27Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Structure of PAF-AH-DEP Complex—A single subunit of the ligand-free PAF-AH structure was used as a search model. Molecular replacement was performed using the program MOLREP (24CCP4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) to solve the structure of the PAF-AH-DEP complex, which had been crystallized using paraoxon inhibited PAF-AH. The structure of the PAF-AH-DEP complex was refined using the program REFMAC5 (24CCP4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). A CIF parameter file for the DEP group, which is covalently attached to Ser273, was prepared using the monomer library sketcher module of the program CCP4 (24CCP4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). Overall Structure of PAF-AH—We have solved the crystal structures of human plasma PAF-AH in a ligand-free form and as a complex with the organophosphate compound paraoxon reacted with the active site Ser273 (Fig. 1). The protein displays a classic α/β-hydrolase fold, typical of other GXSXG lipases. The structure of plasma PAF-AH was submitted to the DALI website to obtain structural homologues (28Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar); the S. exfoliatus lipase structure (20Wei Y. Swenson L. Castro C. Derewenda U. Minor W. Arai H. Aoki J. Inoue K.

The topology diagram of the PAF-AH structure is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. In both of the crystal structures reported here, there are two protein subunits in the asymmetric unit.

The Ramachandran plots of the ligand-free complex and the DEP complex had 91.6 and 89.5% of residues in the most favored region, respectively. Only residue Ser273, which is the active site nucleophile, was observed to be outside of the generously allowed region (phi, 65; psi, -116). The electron density of this region, as shown for the DEP complex structure in Fig. 1D, is very distinct, supporting its proper modeling. The same holds true for the electron density difference map of the 1.5 Å ligand-free structure. The strained conformation of this serine is consistent with other α/β hydrolase enzymes that have nucleophilic serines in a strained ϵ-conformation (29Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). The overall B-factor and deviations from ideal geometry are likewise slightly smaller in the ligand-free structure. One other noteworthy outlier in each subunit of both structures reported is the presence of a cis-peptide bond between Phe72 and Asp73. The electron density of this region is very distinct, thereby supporting the presence of this unusual cis-peptide bond. Disordered Residues and Side Chains—The N- and C-terminal limits of ordered residues observed in our crystal structures are consistent with functional observations of the protein. Plasma PAF-AH functions as a 43-, 44-, or 45-kDa protein with a heterogeneous N terminus starting at residue Ser35, Ile42 or Lys55 (14Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In our structures, seven residues (positions 47–53) are missing from the N terminus in each subunit of both the ligand-free and DEP-bound structures. In each case, our structures begin with residue 54, which is close to the endogenous N-terminal start site at Lys55. In previous studies, the limits of N- and C-terminal truncations had been characterized that still ensure the presence of the full native functions of the enzyme (14Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In our crystal structures, the C terminus has several disordered residues in the ligand-free structure (A, 426–429; B, 428–429) and DEP complex (A, 427–429; B, 424–429). The ordered C-terminal end of our structures is close to the functional limit tolerated by C-terminal truncation. A subtle difference exists between the two subunits of the ligand-free crystal structure in the crystallographic dimer. In subunit B the electron density of residues 88–92 was weak; therefore their side chain atoms have been truncated to correspond to an alanine side chain. Similarly His114 and Trp115 are missing in subunit A and Trp115 and Leu116 are missing in subunit B; therefore each of these side chains have been truncated as well. In addition to these residues mentioned above, several other surface-accessible and polar side chains from the ligand-free crystal structure were disordered and therefore not modeled. In contrast, the DEP-bound crystal structure had well ordered side chain positions for all residues modeled, including residues His114–Leu116. Interface Binding Surface of PAF-AH—The disorder of the residues His114–Leu116, described above, can be explained because of the flexibility of these residues on the surface of the protein. Additionally, these residues are on an α-helix (114–126) that is predicted to be a component of the interfacial binding surface of the protein that accesses the lipoprotein particle. Specific residues shown to be important for binding to LDL by site-directed mutagenesis were Tyr205, Trp115, Leu116, and to a lesser extent Met117 (30Stafforini D.M. Tjoelker L.W. McCormick S.P.

A second short helix (residues 362–369) has hydrophobic residues positioned to insert into the hydrophobic portion of the aqueous-lipid interface. Recently, residues near this helix were predicted to be important for HDL binding (31Gardner A.A. Reichert E.C. Topham M.K. Stafforini D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17099-17106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The predicted interfacial-binding residues of PAF-AH are displayed in Fig. 1B relative to the active site. Active Site of PAF-AH—As originally predicted (14Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 32Derewenda Z.S. Derewenda U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) the active site of PAF-AH contains a catalytic triad of Ser273, His351, and Asp296. Ser273 is located at the N terminus of an α-helix and on the conserved GXSXG motif found in other lipases (14Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The amide nitrogens of Phe274 and Leu153 are well poised to stabilize the negative charge of a tetrahedral intermediate of the reaction mechanism, thereby acting as the oxyanion hole of the enzyme. The other two catalytic triad residues are appropriately positioned to activate the nucleophilic Ser273 for catalysis; Asp296 is located on the C-terminal end of a β-sheet, and His351 is located at the N terminus of an α-helix. Like other lipases, the catalytic triad lies within a hydrophobic pocket that is oriented toward its substrate (Fig. 1, B and C). Notably, the orientation of the catalytic triad and hydrophobic residues Leu153 and Phe274 were previously predicted based on modeling from the distantly related S. exfoliatus lipase structure (32Derewenda Z.S. Derewenda U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). From previous functional and kinetic characterization of PAF-AH, it was suggested that the active site would allow substrates to enter from lipoproteins and the aqueous phase (11Min J.H. Jain M.K. Wilder C. Paul L. Apitz-Castro R. Aspleaf D.C. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12935-12942Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Min J.H. Wilder C. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Paul L. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4539-4549Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The placement of the active site observed in the structure is consistent with these previous findings. DEP Complex of PAF-AH—To gain insights into the active site properties of PAF-AH, we solved the crystal structure of a covalent complex with the organophosphate compound paraoxon. The enzyme was quickly inactivated by paraoxon, as determined by enzymatic assay. Crystal set-ups led to crystals in the C2 space group, just as with the ligand-free structure, but with slightly different cell dimensions (Table 1). An overall alignment of the ligand-free and DEP complex crystal structures shows only subtle differences of side chain positions. A comparison of the ligand-free and DEP complex structures shows an overall Cα RMSD of 0.3 Å. The active site residues are virtually unchanged, aside from the covalent attachment of DEP to Ser273 as depicted in Fig. 2; the complex with DEP-bound (panel A) serves as a mimic of the tetrahedral intermediate of the esterolysis reaction (panel B). The catalytic triad residues and neighboring active site residues are positioned around the PAF-AH-DEP complex in a manner consistent with a tetrahedral intermediate complex (Fig. 1D). Contact distances between active site residues and the bound DEP group are shown in Table 2. Notably, the amide nitrogens of Phe274 and Leu153 make H-bonds with the O-3 oxygen of the DEP moiety, which would correspond with the enolate oxygen of a tetrahedral intermediate. The positions of the two ethoxy groups of the bound DEP group are well ordered, as shown in the electron density maps shown in Fig. 1D. A view of these two groups are shown relative to the active site pocket, which is rendered with a space filling electrostatic surface in Fig. 1C. This complex will be further discussed below, as a means to begin to understand how substrates bind to PAF-AH.TABLE 2DEP and surrounding active site residue contacts within 4 Å Hydrogen bond contacts are shown in italics.DEP atomResidueAtom typeDistanceÅPHis351NE23.74O-1Trp298CE33.41O-2His351NE23.08O-3Gly152C3.58Leu153N2.65Phe274N2.90C-1Phe322CZ3.62C-2Trp298CE23.69C-3Leu153O3.18His3"
https://openalex.org/W2132856536,"SUMOylation is a form of post-translational modification shown to control nuclear transport. Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is an important mediator of cell proliferation and is primarily localized to the nucleus. Here we show that mouse KLF5 is SUMOylated at lysine residues 151 and 202. Mutation of these two lysines or two conserved nearby glutamates results in the loss of SUMOylation and increased cytoplasmic distribution of KLF5, suggesting that SUMOylation enhances nuclear localization of KLF5. Lysine 151 is adjacent to a nuclear export signal (NES) that resembles a consensus NES. The NES in KLF5 directs a fused green fluorescence protein to the cytoplasm, binds the nuclear export receptor CRM1, and is inhibited by leptomycin and site-directed mutagenesis. SUMOylation facilitates nuclear localization of KLF5 by inhibiting this NES activity, and enhances the ability of KLF5 to stimulate anchorage-independent growth of HCT116 colon cancer cells. A survey of proteins whose nuclear localization is regulated by SUMOylation reveals that SUMOylation sites are frequently located in close proximity to NESs. A relatively common mechanism for SUMOylation to regulate nucleocytoplasmic transport may lie in the interplay between neighboring NES and SUMOylation motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2067791475,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a latent transcription factor mainly activated by the interleukin-6 cytokine family. Previous studies have shown that activated STAT3 recruits p300, a coactivator whose intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity is essential for transcription. Here we investigated the function of the STAT3 NH2-terminal domain and how its interaction with p300 regulates STAT3 signal transduction. In STAT3-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, a stably expressed NH2 terminus-deficient STAT3 mutant (STAT3-ΔN) was unable to efficiently induce either STAT3-mediated reporter activity or endogenous mRNA expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to determine whether the NH2-terminal domain regulates p300 recruitment or stabilizes enhanceosome assembly. Despite equivalent levels of STAT3 binding, cells expressing the STAT3-ΔN mutant were unable to recruit p300 and RNA polymerase II to the native socs3 promoter as efficiently as those expressing STAT3-full length. We previously reported that the STAT3 NH2-terminal domain is acetylated by p300 at Lys-49 and Lys-87. By introducing K49R/K87R mutations, here we found that the acetylation status of the STAT3 NH2-terminal domain regulates its interaction with p300. In addition, the STAT3 NH2-terminal binding site maps to the p300 bromodomain, a region spanning from amino acids 995 to 1255. Finally a p300 mutant lacking the bromodomain (p300-ΔB) exhibited a weaker binding to STAT3, and the enhanceosome formation on the socs3 promoter was inhibited when p300-ΔB was overexpressed. Taken together, our data suggest that the STAT3 NH2-terminal domain plays an important role in the interleukin-6 signaling pathway by interacting with the p300 bromodomain, thereby stabilizing enhanceosome assembly.

Immunol. 2007; 178: 2623-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The classic signaling pathway initiated by the IL-6 cytokine family is via ligand binding to cognate high affinity α chain receptors, e.g. IL-6Rα or OSMRα (3Hou T. Tieu B.C. Ray S. Recinos A. Cui R. Tilton R.G. Brasier A.R. Curr. Cardiol. Rev. 2008; 4: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), that then complex with the ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein gp130 β-subunit. The ligand·Rα·gp130 complex activates the cytoplasmic Janus and Tyk tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of gp130, thereby providing docking sites for STAT1 and STAT3 isoforms (1Heinrich P.C.

The recruited STATs are then phosphorylated by the same Janus/Tyk kinases at a specific tyrosine on the COOH-terminal transactivation domain (TAD), inducing their subsequent dimerization, nuclear translocation, and specific binding to IL-6 response elements (6Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). After the nuclear translocation of hetero- or homodimeric STATs, the magnitude of IL-6 signaling is further regulated by the recruitment of coactivators with histone acetyltransferase activity.The crucial role of histone acetyltransferases in inducing chromatin remodeling and transcription activation has long been recognized (7Bayle J.H.

The COOH-terminal TAD contains a conserved single tyrosine residue that is phosphorylated in STAT activation and facilitates transcriptional activation (32Lutticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P. Horn H. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The function of the NH2-terminal domain in STAT3, however, is poorly understood. In this study we investigated the STAT3 NH2-terminal function by stably expressing an NH2 terminus-deleted mutant (STAT3-ΔN) in STAT3-/- MEFs. Both OSM-inducible γ-FBG reporter gene and endogenous mRNA expression including socs3, c-fos, and p21 were significantly reduced in response to STAT3-ΔN expression. Because the STAT3 NH2-terminal domain is involved in p300 binding, the defective activity observed in STAT3-ΔN is probably caused by the reduced cooperation between STAT3 and p300. This hypothesis was then tested in native chromatin by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays that revealed a reduction in OSM-inducible p300 recruitment to the socs3 promoter in MEFs stably expressing STAT3-ΔN. At the same time, there was a decrease in RNA pol II binding to the socs3 promoter, indicating the STAT3 NH2-terminal domain not only stabilizes coactivator association but also facilitates the assembly of transcription preinitiation complex.Recent studies identified STAT3 not only as a binding partner of p300 but also as a substrate for its acetylation where p300 modifies STAT3 at multiple sites. A single acetylation on Lys residue Lys-685 localized in the COOH-terminal TAD is required for STAT3 dimerization and the subsequent DNA binding activity (26Yuan Z.L. Guan Y.J. Chatterjee D. Chin Y.E. Science. 2005; 307: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Our laboratory independently identified two other Lys residues, Lys-49 and Lys-87, in the STAT3 NH2-terminal domain that are also inducibly acetylated by p300 in response to IL-6 and OSM (25Ray S. Boldogh I. Brasier A.R. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1616-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although these NH2-terminal acetylations have no effect on STAT3 DNA binding activity, they are essential for STAT3-dependent transcription because K49R/K87R substitutions significantly inhibit STAT3 target gene expression (25Ray S. Boldogh I. Brasier A.R. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1616-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We also noticed that the K49R/K87R mutations decrease the association between p300 and STAT3, indicating that the inducible NH2-terminal acetylations may augment STAT3-p300 interaction. In this study, we further investigated the interaction between the STAT3 NH2-terminal domain and p300 and found that the acetyl-Lys mimic substitutions (K49Q/K87Q) increase the STAT3 NH2-terminal binding to p300, confirming the hypothesis that the NH2-terminal acetylations stabilize the STAT3-p300 interaction. We also discovered that the STAT3 NH2-terminal binding site maps to the p300 bromodomain. The deletion of the bromodomain in p300 molecule decreased its ability to cooperate with STAT3. In addition, the bromodomain-deficient p300 mutant (p300-ΔB) exhibited weaker chromatin binding. Taken together, we propose a model in which the IL-6- or OSM-inducible acetylations of STAT3 on Lys residues 49 and 87 trigger the recognition of the NH2-terminal domain by the p300 bromodomain, resulting in a strengthened recruitment of p300 to the promoter of the STAT3 target gene, thereby facilitating subsequent enhanceosome assembly.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Polyclonal antibodies of p300 (N-15), STAT3 (c-20), and RNA pol II (N-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies against V5 and FLAG were obtained, respectively, from Invitrogen and Sigma. Recombinant mouse OSM was provided by R&D Systems.Cell Cultures—The human HepG2 and HEK 293 cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured as described before (25Ray S. Boldogh I. Brasier A.R. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1616-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 33Hou T. Ray S. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37091-37102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). STAT3+/- and STAT3-/- MEFs were generous gifts from Dr. Stephanie Watowich at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were serum-starved for at least 16 h before treatment with OSM (20 ng/ml) or IL-6 (10 ng/ml).Plasmid Construction—The γ-FBG-LUC reporter and pEFF6-V5-STAT3 expression vectors including full length (FL), STAT3-ΔN (aa 133–770), and V5-STAT3-130 (aa 1–130) were constructed as described previously (33Hou T. Ray S. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37091-37102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged WT-124, KR-124, and KQ-124 were produced by PCR using pEFF6-V5-STAT3-WT, STAT3-K48R/K87R, and STAT3-K48Q/K87Q (25Ray S. Boldogh I. Brasier A.R. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1616-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) as templates, respectively. The primers used for this purpose were: sense primer 5′-CATCGATGGATCCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAGGCCCAATGGAATCAGCTACAG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CGTACCTCTAGACTACTGGGCCGCAGTGGCTGCAGTCTG-3′. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and XbaI endonucleases, gel-purified, and cloned into pECFP-Nuc (Clontech) restricted with the same endonucleases.The expression vector used for PXFS-FLAG-p300 constructs was described previously (33Hou T. Ray S. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37091-37102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The full-length p300 cDNA was amplified from pCMVβ p300 (34Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) using the following primers: sense 5′-CAGTCTAGACGTAAGCTTGCCGAGAATGTGGTGGAACCGG-3′ and antisense 5′-CTCGTAGATATCCTAGTGTATGTCTAGTGTACTC-3′. The PCR product was restricted with HindIII and EcoRV and cloned into the PXFS-FLAG vector. The four NH2 terminus-deleted truncations (p300-ΔN1, p300-ΔN2, p300-ΔN3, and p300-ΔN4) were produced from p300-FL by PCR using the same antisense primer, 5′-CATGAACTACTCTAACAGTGACC-3′, and different sense primers as follows: sense 5′-GGTTCTGGAGCAAAGCTTGCTGATCCAGAGAAGCGCAAGCTCATCC-3′ for p300-ΔN1, sense 5′-CCATCCACTACTAAGCTTCGGAAACAGTGGCACGAAGATATTAC-3′ for p300-ΔN2, sense 5′-GTCAAAGAAAAAGCTTTTCAAACCCAGAAGAACTACGACAG-3′ for p300-ΔN3, and sense 5′-GCGGAAGAAAGATGAAGCTTATCTGTGTCCTTCACCATGAGATC-3′ for p300-ΔN4. All the PCR fragments were restricted by HindIII and XbaI and cloned into the PXFS-FLAG plasmid restricted with the same endonucleases. The two COOH terminus-deleted truncations (p300-ΔC1 and p300-ΔC2) were amplified from p300-FL using the same sense primer as for p300-FL, 5′-ACGTCTAGACGTAAGCTTGCCGAGAATGTGGTGGAACCGG-3′, and antisense primer 5′-GATATCCTAGATCTCATGGTGAAGGACACAG-3′ for p300-ΔC1 or antisense primer 5′-GATATCCTACGGAGATGACTGGGTAGCT-3′ for p300-ΔC2. The PCR products were digested with HindIII and EcoRV and ligated into the PXFS-Straw-FLAG plasmid restricted with the same endonucleases. p300-ΔB mutant was generated by two steps. First the fragment containing the sequences encoding aa 1–994 was produced by using the primer set sense 5′-CAGTCTAGACGTAAGCTTGCCGAGAATGTGGTGGAACCGG-3′ and antisense 5-CTGAAATAAGCTTCGGCTGAGTATCTGCTGG-3′ from p300-FL, producing a PCR product overhang with a HindIII site on both the 5′- and 3′-ends. This PCR product was then restricted with HindIII and fused into pXFS-FLAG-ΔN4 upstream of the sequences encoding aa 1255 of p300, finally producing a plasmid encoding p300 mutant with the internal region spanning from aa 995 to aa 1255 deleted (p300-ΔB).Transient Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—Transient transfection using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) was performed in triplicate plates according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the reporter assay, cells were plated into 6-well plates and cotransfected with the γ-FBG-LUC reporter gene, the indicated expression vectors, and the transfection efficiency control plasmid pSV2PAP. 24 h later, cells were stimulated with OSM or IL-6. Both luciferase and alkaline phosphatase activities were measured 48 h after transfection. For the co-immunoprecipitation assay, the indicated expression plasmids were cotransfected into 10-cm2 dishes using the same protocol, and cells were harvested for protein extraction 24 h after transfection.Preparation of Subcellular Extracts—Sucrose cushion-purified nuclear extract (NE) was prepared as described before (25Ray S. Boldogh I. Brasier A.R. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1616-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged. Pellets were resuspended in a double cell volume of solution A and centrifuged to obtain the supernatants as cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellets were purified in solution B and lysed in solution C. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatants were saved as NE. The protein concentrations were measured by Coomassie dye binding (protein reagent, Bio-Rad).Western Immunoblot—Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk for 0.5–1 h and incubated with indicated primary Ab at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with secondary Ab at 20 °C for 1 h. Signals were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) or visualized by the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. β-Actin was used as a loading control.Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—1–2 mg of protein was precleared with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of 5 μg of the indicated primary Ab at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were captured by adding 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% slurry) and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. After the supernatant was discarded, protein A-Sepharose beads were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline four to five times, and immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE.Two-step ChIP Assay—Two-step ChIP was performed as described previously (35Nowak D.E. Tian B. Brasier A.R. BioTechniques. 2005; 39: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In brief, 4–6 × 106 MEFs cells/100-mm dish were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline after stimulation. Protein-protein cross-linking was first performed with disuccinimidyl glutarate (Pierce) followed by protein-DNA cross-linking with formaldehyde. After cells were washed and collected in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pellets were lysed by SDS lysis buffer and sonicated four times for 15 s each at setting 4 with a 10-s break on ice until DNA fragment lengths were between 200 and 1000 bp. Equal amounts of DNA were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of the indicated Abs in ChIP dilution buffer. Immunoprecipitates were collected with 40 μl of protein A magnetic beads (Dynal Inc., Brown Deer, WI) and washed sequentially with ChIP dilution buffer, high salt buffer, LiCl wash buffer, and finally in 1× Tris-EDTA buffer. DNA was eluted in 250 μl of elution buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were decross-linked in decross-linking mixture at 65 °C for 2 h. DNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted, precipitated by 100% ethanol, and used for real time PCR.Quantitative Real Time PCR (Q-RT-PCR)—Total cellular RNA was extracted by Tri Reagent (Sigma). 2 μg of RNA was used for reverse transcription using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System from Invitrogen. 2 μl of cDNA products was amplified in a 20-μl reaction system containing 10 μl of iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and 400 nm primer mixture. The primers were designed by PrimerExpress v2.0 and are shown in Table 1. All the reactions were processed in a MyiQ Single Color Real-Time PCR thermocycler using a two-step plus melting curve program, and the results were analyzed by the iQ5 program (Bio-Rad). The -fold change of mRNA expression was calculated by normalizing the absolute amount to internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and comparing with untreated cells.TABLE 1Primer sets used for Q-RT-PCRTarget genesSenseAntisensesocs35′-CCGCGGGCACCTTTC-3′5′-TTGACGCTCAACGTGAAGAAGT-3′c-fos5′-CCTGCCCCTTCTCAACGA-3′5′-TCCACGTTGCTGATGCTCTT-3′p215′-TTCCGCACAGGAGCAAAGT-3′5′-CGGCGCAACTGCTCACT-3′ Open table in a new tab For quantitative real time genomic PCR, the primer set used for the ChIP assay was first tested by performing quantitative PCR on serial dilutions of mouse genomic DNA (from 40 ng to 25 μg) isolated from MEFs. A standard curve was generated by plotting the logarithm of the genomic DNA concentration versus the threshold cycle (Ct value). This standard curve confirmed that ChIP-quantitative PCR results were within the linear range of amplification (not shown). The -fold change of DNA in each immunoprecipitate was determined by the comparative Ct method. First the Ct value of each sample was normalized to the corresponding input DNA reference, producing the ΔCt value (ΔCt = Ctsample - Ctinput). Next the signals in OSM-treated samples were compared with those of untreated samples by calculating the ΔΔCt value (ΔΔCt = ΔCttreated - ΔCtuntreated). Here ΔCttreated was the Ct value of OSM-treated samples normalized to input DNA, and ΔCtuntreated represented the Ct value of OSM-untreated samples normalized to input DNA. Finally we calculated the -fold change relative to that amount in unstimulated cells as 2-ΔΔCt. The primer set used for quantitative real time genomic PCR to amply the STAT3 binding sites on the socs3 promoter included sense primer 5′-CGCGCACAGCCTTTCAGT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CCCCCGATTCCTGGAACT-3′.RESULTSThe STAT3 NH2-terminal Domain Is Required for OSM-inducible Transcription—Based on our findings that the STAT3 NH2-terminal domain may play an important role in STAT3 function, we generated a V5 epitope-tagged STAT3 mutant (V5-STAT3-ΔN) in which the entire NH2-terminal region (aa 1–133) was deleted and tested its transcriptional activity in luciferase reporter assays. For this purpose, STAT3-/- MEFs were used to avoid the interference from endogenous STAT3. First the loss of STAT3 in STAT3-/- MEFs was confirmed by Western immunoblot (Fig. 1A, left panel). STAT3-/- MEFs were then transiently transfected with V5-STAT3-FL or V5-STAT3-ΔN, and ectopically expressed STAT3 was measured by Western immunoblot with anti-V5 Ab. As seen in Fig. 1A, right panel, the expression of V5-STAT3-ΔN was not affected by the removal of the NH2-terminal domain.Different doses of V5-STAT3-FL or V5-STAT3-ΔN were then cotransfected with the reporter gene γ-FBG-LUC, which contains the three native STAT3 binding sites from the γ-FBG gene. Because MEFs express low levels of IL-6Rα and OSM has been shown to induce STAT3-p300 cooperation in STAT3-/- MEFs (36Sun W. Snyder M. Levy D.E. Zhang J.J. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5880-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), OSM was used in these experiments to activate STAT3 signal transduction. Reporter activity was measured in the presence or absence of OSM. As little as 0.25 μg of V5-STAT3-FL was able to increase γ-FBG-LUC activity by about 3-fold, and a further increase to 5-fold was observed when the amount of V5-STAT3-FL expression vector was increased (Fig. 1B).

We have previously shown that peroxisomes share some components of their division machinery with mitochondria. hFis1, a tail-anchored membrane protein, regulates the membrane fission of both organelles by DLP1/Drp1 recruitment, but nothing is known about the mechanisms of the dual targeting of hFis1. Here we demonstrate for the first time that peroxisomal targeting of hFis1 depends on Pex19p, a peroxisomal membrane protein import factor. hFis1/Pex19p binding was demonstrated by expression and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Using mutated versions of hFis1 an essential binding region for Pex19p was located within the last 26 C-terminal amino acids of hFis1, which are required for proper targeting to both mitochondria and peroxisomes. The basic amino acids in the very C terminus are not essential for Pex19p binding and peroxisomal targeting, but are instead required for mitochondrial targeting. Silencing of Pex19p by small interference RNA reduced the targeting of hFis1 to peroxisomes, but not to mitochondria. In contrast, overexpression of Pex19p alone was not sufficient to shift the targeting of hFis1 to peroxisomes. Our findings indicate that targeting of hFis1 to peroxisomes and mitochondria are independent events and support a direct, Pex19p-dependent targeting of peroxisomal tail-anchored proteins.

In recent years it has become apparent that peroxisomes and mitochondria are two organelles having more in common than previously assumed (1Schrader M. Yoon Y. BioEssays. 2007; 29: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Besides their metabolic interplay, for example in fatty acid β-oxidation, lipid homeostasis, and reactive oxygen species metabolism, an overlap in the division machinery of both organelles was also discovered (2Schrader M.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4141-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We and others have recently demonstrated that hFis1 also localizes to the peroxisomal membrane and that it is likewise mediating peroxisomal fission by recruiting DLP1/Drp1 to peroxisomes (18Koch A. Yoon Y. Bonekamp N.A. McNiven M.A. Schrader M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 19Kobayashi S. Tanaka A. Fujiki Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 1675-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Increasing the amount of hFis1 on peroxisomes and mitochondria has been shown to promote peroxisomal and mitochondrial division (4Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2005; 16: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Apparently, both organelles have to compete for DLP1, and thus, hFis1 has a key function in recruiting DLP1 to peroxisomes and mitochondria. A function of yeast Fis1p in peroxisomal division has also been reported (20Kuravi K. Nagotu S. Krikken A.M. Sjollema K. Deckers M. Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3994-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). So far, hFis1 is one of the few membrane proteins known to be targeted to both peroxisomes and mitochondria (2Schrader M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, it is currently not understood how this dual targeting is achieved. Very recently, another tail-anchored protein, Mff, has been identified, which is targeted to both peroxisomes and mitochondria, and is supposed to play a role in organelle division/dynamics as well (21Gandre-Babbe, S., and van der Bliek, A. M. (2008) Mol. Biol. CellGoogle Scholar). Due to the proximity of the transmembrane domain to the C terminus, TA proteins show a particular mode of biogenesis and have to be inserted into their target membranes post-translationally (for a recent review see Ref. 22Borgese N. Brambillasca S. Colombo S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The targeting signals of TA proteins for the sorting to and insertion into the respective membranes are generally encoded in their C termini, including the transmembrane domain (22Borgese N.

The import signal of mitochondrial TA proteins is in the main a transmembrane domain with moderate length and hydrophobicity, flanked by basic amino acids (22Borgese N. Brambillasca S. Colombo S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although the TOM complex mediates the import of most mitochondrial membrane proteins (25Rapaport D.

Biochem. 2007; 76: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar), there is evidence that the targeting of mitochondrial TA proteins is independent of this complex (27Setoguchi K. Otera H.

Thus, delivery of membrane (and TA) proteins to peroxisomes per se can be mediated by direct insertion from the cytosol, by transit through the ER (or a subdomain) (35Van Ael E. Fransen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1629-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and via mitochondria by a population of MDVs. However, most peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) are likely to be inserted into peroxisomes directly from the cytosol. This process requires Pex19p, a mainly cytosolic protein that acts as chaperone and/or import factor for most PMPs (36Sacksteder K.A. Jones J.M. South S.T. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J.

In a recent study, it has been reported that the peroxisomal TA proteins Pex26p and yeast Pex15p utilize the regular machinery for the import of PMPs and are targeted by binding of Pex19p (33Halbach A.

In this study we have investigated the membrane targeting of mammalian hFis1. We show that the C-terminal domain of hFis1 contains a Pex19p binding site, and that Pex19p is required for peroxisomal targeting of hFis1. Pex19p binding is independent of basic amino acid residues in the C terminus of hFis1, which are instead required for mitochondrial targeting. We provide first evidence for a direct, Pex19p-dependent targeting of tail-anchored hFis1 to peroxisomes. cDNAs and Antibodies—hFis1 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), or the Myc epitope tag (GFP-hFis1 and Myc-hFis1), the C-terminally truncated hFis1 constructs (Myc-hFis1-ΔC and Myc-hFis1-ΔTM/C), and a construct encoding the C-terminal 26 amino acids of hFis1 tagged to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (hFis1-YFP-TM/C) were described previously (4Yoon Y.

Constructs encoding hFis1 carrying point mutations and fused to GFP (GFP-hFis1K149A, GFP-hFis1K151A, and GFP-hFis1K149/151A) were kindly provided by M. T. Ryan (LaTrobe University, Melbourne, Australia (12Stojanovski D. Koutsopoulos O.S. Okamoto K. Ryan M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1). Pex19 fused to YFP or the HA epitope tag (YFP-Pex19 and HA-Pex19) was a gift from P. U. Mayerhofer (Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany). Pex11pβ C-terminally fused to the Myc epitope tag (Pex11pβ-Myc) was described previously (46Schrader M. Reuber B.E. Morrell J.C. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Obie C. Stroh T.A. Valle D. Schroer T.A. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29607-29614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Human cDNA was produced from mRNA isolated from HepG2 cells. The following primer sequences (MWG, Martiensried, Germany) were used to amplify the coding sequence of hsPex11pα (accession number NM_003847) from this cDNA by nested PCR: 5′-CCAGAGGACCCACGCCTGAGCC-3′ (outer forward primer), 5′-ATGTCTGTCCCACCAAGAGGCC-3′ (outer reverse primer), 5′-TTGAATTCATGGACGCCTTCACCCGCTTC-3′ (inner forward primer) and 5′-GAAGATCTCGGGTCTTCAGCTTCATCG-3′ (inner reverse primer). Using the restriction sites for EcoRI and BglII at the ends of the final PCR product (underlined) Pex11α cDNA was inserted in-frame into the pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) using EcoRI and BamHI and verified by sequencing (MWG). Rabbit anti-PMP70 antibody was kindly provided by A. Völkl (University of Heidelberg, Germany), and rabbit anti-hTom22C antibody was a gift from M. T. Ryan (La Trobe University). Rabbit anti-hFis1 (a kind gift from Y. Yoon, University of Rochester) and anti-GFP (Invitrogen; recognizes also YFP) antibodies were used for immunoblotting, as well as mouse anti-Pex19p antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and mouse anti-VDAC1 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Clontech; recognizes also YFP) and rabbit anti-Fis1 (Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland) were used for immunoprecipitation studies, monoclonal anti-HA epitope antibody (Covance, Princeton, NJ), anti-Myc epitope 9E10 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-Tom20 antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) were used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Specific anti-IgG antibodies conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine 5-isothiocyanate (TRITC) or to Alexa488 were obtained from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany), Invitrogen, and MoBiTec (Göttingen, Germany). Cell Culture, RNA Interference, and Transfection Experiments—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (47Schrader M. King S.J. Stroh T.A. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For morphological studies the cells were transfected with DNA constructs by incubation with polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich) or via electroporation (46Schrader M. Reuber B.E. Morrell J.C.

Li Y. Elsasser H.P. Kissel T. Pharm. Res. 1999; 16: 1273-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation studies the cells were transfected with DEAE-dextran (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). To knock down the expression of Pex19p (accession number NM_002857) by RNA interference, 21-nucleotide small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected into the cells by electroporation (49Boll A. Schrader M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2005; 53: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Pex19-specific siRNA oligonucleotides were obtained as pre-designed siRNAs from Ambion (Austin, TX) (5′-GGAGAUCACAGAAAAGUAUtt-3′,5′-GGAGACACUGCCAAAGAUGtt-3′, and 5′-GGAACUAUUCGACAGUGAAtt-3′) and adopted from Jones et al.

As controls, cells were either transfected with buffer or with non-targeting siRNA. 48 h after transfection with siRNA the cells were transfected by electroporation with DNA encoding for GFP-hFis1 or Pex11pβ-Myc and morphologically assayed for peroxisomal import after 3, 6, and 24 h. Immunofluorescence and Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 or 25 μg/ml digitonin and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies as described (46Schrader M. Reuber B.E. Morrell J.C. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Obie C. Stroh T.A. Valle D. Schroer T.A. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29607-29614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were processed for immunofluorescence 3, 6, 24, or 48 h after transfection. Samples were examined using an Olympus IX81 microscope (Olympus Optical, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a PlanApo 100×/1.40 oil objective. Fluorescence images were acquired with an F-view II CCD camera (Soft Imaging System GmbH, Münster, Germany) driven by Soft imaging software. Confocal images were acquired on an LSM-510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using a ×100 objective. Digital images were optimized for contrast and brightness using appropriate software. For quantitative analysis of peroxisomal morphology, 100-200 cells per coverslip were examined and categorized as cells with spherical (0.1-0.3 μm) or tubular (2-5 μm in length) peroxisomes as described previously (50Schrader M. Burkhardt J.K. Baumgart E. Luers G. Spring H. Volkl A. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 24-35PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities were determined on digital images by encircling single peroxisomes (or mitochondria), and the GFP/TRITC ratio was calculated. Images were processed and quantified using LSM-510 software (Carl Zeiss Micro-Imaging, Inc.). Usually two coverslips per preparation were analyzed and three to five independent experiments were performed. Significant differences between experimental groups were detected by analysis of variance for unpaired variables using Microsoft Excel software. Data are presented as means ± S.D., with an unpaired t test used to determine statistical differences. p values <0.05 were considered as significant, and p values <0.01 were considered as highly significant. Immunoprecipitations—To study the interaction of Pex19p and hFis1, COS-7 cells were transfected with different hFis1 and Pex19p constructs or not transfected for detection of endogenous interactions. To stabilize potentially transient or weak interactions, in some experiments whole cells were subjected to chemical cross-linking by incubation with the cleavable cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP, Pierce) as described (4Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5409-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 18Koch A. Yoon Y. Bonekamp N.A. McNiven M.A. Schrader M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed after 48 h by adding lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton-X-100) containing a protease inhibitor mixture, passed through a 26.5-gauge syringe needle ten times and incubated by mixing at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min). In case of immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-GFP/YFP or anti-Fis1 antibodies, a preclearing with 30 μl of Protein-A-Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich) was performed. The cleared lysates were afterward preincubated with the respective antibodies for 1 h. IP was performed by adding 50 μl of Protein-A-Sepharose or 25 μl of a 25% slurry of anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibodies conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubation with mixing at 4 °C overnight. The beads were extensively washed with wash buffer 1 (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), followed by wash buffer 2 (500 mm NaCl, 125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton-X-100), one time with phosphate-buffered saline and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, which also cleaves the cross-linker DSP. The immunoprecipitated proteins and the corresponding input (load) were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. To study the association of endogenous hFis1 with peroxisomes, peroxisomal membranes were immunoprecipitated according to a previous study (6Li X. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17012-17020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells expressing Pex11pα-YFP were homogenized in homogenization buffer (5 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture) by passing gently through a 26.5-gauge syringe needle. The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min), and peroxisomes were subfractionated by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 25 min. The organelle pellet was then gently resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA), and the peroxisomal membranes were immunoprecipitated by preincubation for 1 h with anti-GFP/YFP antibodies, followed by overnight incubation with Protein-A-Sepharose. The beads were extensively washed with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) (6Li X. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17012-17020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-hFis1 antibody. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose using a semidry apparatus, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblots were processed using specific primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad), and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). For quantification, immunoblots were scanned with a Bio-Rad GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer and processed using Bio-Rad Laboratories Quantity One software. Interaction of Pex19p and hFis1—Pex19p is a chaperone involved in the targeting of peroxisomal membrane proteins (39Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 51Heiland I. Erdmann R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2362-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 52Schliebs W. Kunau W.H. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 397-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that Pex19p functions as a targeting factor for the peroxisomal TA protein Pex26p (33Halbach A. Landgraf C. Lorenzen S. Rosenkranz K. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Rottensteiner H. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2508-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To examine if Pex19p is also involved in peroxisomal targeting of hFis1, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation studies. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with Myc-hFis1 and YFP-Pex19p constructs (Figs. 1, 2, and 3). After 48 h cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitations with anti-Myc as well as anti-GFP/YFP antibodies were performed. Myc-hFis1 was observed to co-precipitate with YFP-Pex19p (Fig. 2A, upper panel, left). Furthermore, YFP-Pex19p was found to co-precipitate with Myc-hFis1 (Fig. 3A, lane a). These results strongly suggest that Pex19p and hFis1 are part of the same complex.FIGURE 3The Pex19p binding region is located in the C terminus of hFis1 and does not require basic amino acids. A, co-transfection of COS-7 cells with YFP-Pex19p and Myc-hFis1 (lane a), Myc-hFis1-ΔC(lane b), or Myc-hFis1-ΔTM/C (lane c) followed by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Myc antibodies conjugated to agarose beads. The analysis of the samples was performed by immunoblotting using anti-GFP/YFP antibodies. Note that Pex19p binding to hFis1 is impaired after removal of the C-terminal tail or the transmembrane domain of hFis1 (lanes b and c). To exclude unspecific co-precipitations control experiments were performed with cytosolic YFP (pEYFP-N1) and Myc-hFis1 (lane d). B, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with HA-Pex19p and GFP-hFis1 (lane a), hFis1-YFP-TM/C (lane b), GFP-hFis1K149/151A (lane c), or cytosolic GFP as negative control (pEGFP-N1; lane d). IPs were performed by adding anti-GFP/YFP antibodies and Protein A-Sepharose. The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. Note that the C-terminal domain of hFis1 (TM/C, 26 amino acids) fused to YFP is sufficient to co-precipitate HA-Pex19p (lane b) and that mutations of the basic amino acids in the very C terminus of hFis1 do not abolish binding to HA-Pex19p (lane c). C, amino acid sequence of the C terminus (amino acids 122-152) of hFis1. The transmembrane domain is boxed, and basic amino acids (Lys-149 and Lys-151) are in bold.

For all other immunoprecipitations (e.g. with GFP-hFis1 or Pex11pβ-Myc), cross-linking could be omitted, and DSP was no longer used. As a positive control for our assay, we verified that Pex11pβ-Myc, which was previously shown to bind Pex19p (39Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J.

https://openalex.org/W1987827373,"Epigenetic changes are thought to lead to alterations in the property of cells, such as differentiation potential. Neural precursor cells (NPCs) differentiate only into neurons in the midgestational brain, yet they become able to generate astrocytes in the late stage of development. This differentiation-potential switch could be explained by epigenetic changes, since the promoters of astrocyte-specific marker genes, glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap) and S100beta, have been shown to become demethylated in late-stage NPCs prior to the onset of astrocyte differentiation; however, whether demethylation occurs generally in other astrocyctic genes remains unknown. Here we analyzed DNA methylation changes in mouse NPCs between the mid-(E11.5) and late (E14.5) stage of development by a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling method using microarrays and found that many astrocytic genes are demethylated in late-stage NPCs, enabling the cell to become competent to express these genes. Although these genes are already demethylated in late-stage NPCs, they are not expressed until cells differentiate into astrocytes. Thus, late-stage NPCs have epigenetic potential which can be realized in their expression after astrocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2108376995,"Ankyrin-B targets ion channels and transporters in excitable cells. Dysfunction in ankyrin-B-based pathways results in defects in cardiac physiology. Despite a wealth of knowledge regarding the role of ankyrin-B for cardiac function, little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying ankyrin-B regulation. Moreover, the pathways underlying ankyrin-B targeting in heart are unclear. We report that alternative splicing regulates ankyrin-B localization and function in cardiomyocytes. Specifically, we identify a novel exon (exon 43') in the ankyrin-B regulatory domain that mediates interaction with the Rho-GEF obscurin. Ankyrin-B transcripts harboring exon 43' represent the primary cardiac isoform in human and mouse. We demonstrate that ankyrin-B and obscurin are co-localized at the M-line of myocytes and co-immunoprecipitate from heart. We define the structural requirements for ankyrin-B/obscurin interaction to two motifs in the ankyrin-B regulatory domain and demonstrate that both are critical for obscurin/ankyrin-B interaction. In addition, we demonstrate that interaction with obscurin is required for ankyrin-B M-line targeting. Specifically, both obscurin-binding motifs are required for the M-line targeting of a GFP-ankyrin-B regulatory domain. Moreover, this construct acts as a dominant-negative by competing with endogenous ankyrin-B for obscurin-binding at the M-line, thus providing a powerful new tool to evaluate the function of obscurin/ankyrin-B interactions. With this new tool, we demonstrate that the obscurin/ankyrin-B interaction is critical for recruitment of PP2A to the cardiac M-line. Together, these data provide the first evidence for the molecular basis of ankyrin-B and PP2A targeting and function at the cardiac M-line. Finally, we report that ankyrin-B R1788W is localized adjacent to the ankyrin-B obscurin-binding motif and increases binding activity for obscurin. In summary, our new findings demonstrate that ANK2 is subject to alternative splicing that gives rise to unique polypeptides with diverse roles in cardiac function."
https://openalex.org/W2051707340,"Synaptotagmin (syt) 1 is localized to synaptic vesicles, binds Ca2+, and regulates neuronal exocytosis. Syt 1 harbors two Ca2+-binding motifs referred to as C2A and C2B. In this study we examine the function of the isolated C2 domains of Syt 1 using a reconstituted, SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor)-mediated, fusion assay. We report that inclusion of phosphatidylethanolamine into reconstituted SNARE vesicles enabled isolated C2B, but not C2A, to regulate Ca2+-triggered fusion. The isolated C2B domain had a 6-fold lower EC50 for Ca2+-activated fusion than the intact cytosolic domain of Syt 1 (C2AB). Phosphatidylethanolamine increased both the rate and efficiency of C2AB- and C2B-regulated fusion without affecting their abilities to bind membrane-embedded syntaxin-SNAP-25 (t-SNARE) complexes. At equimolar concentrations, the isolated C2A domain was an effective inhibitor of C2B-, but not C2AB-regulated fusion; hence, C2A has markedly different effects in the fusion assay depending on whether it is tethered to C2B. Finally, scanning alanine mutagenesis of C2AB revealed four distinct groups of mutations within the C2B domain that play roles in the regulation of SNARE-mediated fusion. Surprisingly, substitution of Arg-398 with alanine, which lies on the opposite end of C2B from the Ca2+/membrane-binding loops, decreases C2AB t-SNARE binding and Ca2+-triggered fusion in vitro without affecting Ca2+-triggered interactions with phosphatidylserine or vesicle aggregation. In addition, some mutations uncouple the clamping and stimulatory functions of syt 1, suggesting that these two activities are mediated by distinct structural determinants in C2B."
https://openalex.org/W2002066954,"Background A number of different malaria vaccine candidates are currently in pre-clinical or clinical development. Even though they vary greatly in their characteristics, it is unlikely that any of them will provide long-lasting sterilizing immunity against the malaria parasite. There is great uncertainty about what the minimal vaccine profile should be before registration is worthwhile; how to allocate resources between different candidates with different profiles; which candidates to consider combining; and what deployment strategies to consider. Methods and Findings We use previously published stochastic simulation models, calibrated against extensive epidemiological data, to make quantitative predictions of the population effects of malaria vaccines on malaria transmission, morbidity and mortality. The models are fitted and simulations obtained via volunteer computing. We consider a range of endemic malaria settings with deployment of vaccines via the Expanded program on immunization (EPI), with and without additional booster doses, and also via 5-yearly mass campaigns for a range of coverages. The simulation scenarios account for the dynamic effects of natural and vaccine induced immunity, for treatment of clinical episodes, and for births, ageing and deaths in the cohort. Simulated pre-erythrocytic vaccines have greatest benefits in low endemic settings (<EIR of 10.5) where between 12% and 14% of all deaths are averted when initial efficacy is 50%. In some high transmission scenarios (>EIR of 84) PEV may lead to increased incidence of severe disease in the long term, if efficacy is moderate to low (<70%). Blood stage vaccines (BSV) are most useful in high transmission settings, and are comparable to PEV for low transmission settings. Combinations of PEV and BSV generally perform little better than the best of the contributing components. A minimum half-life of protection of 2–3 years appears to be a precondition for substantial epidemiological effects. Herd immunity effects can be achieved with even moderately effective (>20%) malaria vaccines (either PEV or BSV) when deployed through mass campaigns targeting all age-groups as well as EPI, and especially if combined with highly efficacious transmission-blocking components. Conclusions We present for the first time a stochastic simulation approach to compare likely effects on morbidity, mortality and transmission of a range of malaria vaccines and vaccine combinations in realistic epidemiological and health systems settings. The results raise several issues for vaccine clinical development, in particular appropriateness of vaccine types for different transmission settings; the need to assess transmission to the vector and duration of protection; and the importance of deployment additional to the EPI, which again may make the issue of number of doses required more critical. To test the validity and robustness of our conclusions there is a need for further modeling (and, of course, field research) using alternative formulations for both natural and vaccine induced immunity. Evaluation of alternative deployment strategies outside EPI needs to consider the operational implications of different approaches to mass vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W1987588732,"Phenotypically distinct clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are capable of altering the balance that exists between the pathogen and human host and ultimately the outcome of infection. This study has identified two M. tuberculosis strains (i.e. HN885 and HN1554) among a bank of clinical isolates with a striking defect in phagocytosis by primary human macrophages when compared with strain Erdman, a commonly used laboratory strain for studies of pathogenesis. Mass spectrometry in conjunction with NMR studies unequivocally confirmed that both HN885 and HN1554 contain truncated and more branched forms of mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) with a marked reduction of their linear arabinan (corresponding mainly to the inner Araf-α(1→5)-Araf unit) and mannan (with fewer 6-Manp residues and more substitutions in the linear Manp-α(1→6)-Manp unit) domains. The truncation in the ManLAM molecules produced by strains HN885 and HN1554 led to a significant reduction in their surface availability. In addition, there was a marked reduction of higher order phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides and the presence of dimycocerosates, triglycerides, and phenolic glycolipid in their cell envelope. Less exposed ManLAM and reduced higher order phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides in strains HN885 and HN1554 resulted in their low association with the macrophage mannose receptor. Despite reduced phagocytosis, ingested bacilli replicated at a fast rate following serum opsonization. Our results provide evidence that the clinical spectrum of tuberculosis may be dictated not only by the host but also by the amounts and ratios of surface exposed mycobacterial adherence factors defined by strain genotype.

Tuberculosis causes immense morbidity and mortality worldwide (1World Health OrganizationGlobal Tuberculosis control surveillance, planning, and financing. World Health Organization Press, Geneva, Switzerland2007Google Scholar). The causative bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is phagocytosed by and grows within host macrophages. Our recent studies (2Kang P.B. Azad A.K. Torrelles J.B. Kaufman T.M. Beharka A. Tibesar E. Desjardin L.E. Schlesinger L.S. J. Exp.

Linehan S.A. Taylor P.R. Gordon S. Immunobiology. 2001; 204: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).

ManLAM and higher order PIMs (i.e. PIM5 and PIM6) have exposed Man-α(1→2)-Man nonreducing termini that engage the mannose receptor (MR) on human macrophages during phagocytosis (3Torrelles J.B.

To date, studies of M. tuberculosis phagocytosis have focused largely on use of the common laboratory virulent strains Erdman and H37Rv and the attenuated strain H37Ra. Recently, banks of clinical isolates have been characterized in an attempt to link epidemiology and genetic analyses in order to better understand the pathogenesis of the tuberculosis (8Sreevatsan S.

These population studies classified M. tuberculosis into three distinct genetic groups, designated principal genetic group 1, 2, and 3 (PGG-1, -2, and -3), based on allelic variation in genes encoding gyrase and catalase-peroxidase (8Sreevatsan S. Pan X. Stockbauer K.E. Connell N.D. Kreiswirth B.N. Whittam T.S. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Studies using this bank of clinical isolates showed that different M. tuberculosis clinical isolates within the PPGs vary in their ability to cause disease in humans and are capable of inducing different immunologic responses in the host. In particular, M. tuberculosis HN878 is associated with an unusually high proportion of active cases of disease and a high frequency of extrapulmonary disease (10Manca C. Tsenova L. Bergtold A. Freeman S. Tovey M. Musser J.M. Barry III, C.E. Freedman V.H. Kaplan G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5752-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). This has been attributed to immune subversion (14Reed M.B. Domenech P. Manca C. Su H. Barczak A.K. Kreiswirth B.N. Kaplan G. Barry III, C.E. Nature. 2004; 431: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In contrast, the M. tuberculosis clinical isolate CDC1551 caused a low number of cases of active disease, followed by an unusually high rate of seroconversion, and it has been found to induce a more rigorous immunologic response (9Manca C. Tsenova L. Barry III, C.E. Bergtold A. Freeman S. Haslett P.A. Musser J.M. Freedman V.H. Kaplan G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6740-6746PubMed Google Scholar, 11Valway S.E. Sanchez M.P.C. Shinnick T.F.

Here we randomly selected M. tuberculosis strains from the bank of PGG-1, -2, and -3 M. tuberculosis isolates described above to screen for alterations in bacterial association with primary human macrophages in order to better characterize microbial determinants important in this process. We discovered that two phylogenetically related PGG-1 strains are significantly reduced in macrophage association and phagocytosis and demonstrate increased intracellular growth following serum opsonization. These strains contain a truncated form of ManLAM buried within their cell envelope and a reduction in higher order PIMs; thus, they do not engage the MR during phagocytosis. They also contain phenolic glycolipid (PGL), triglycerides and dimycocerosates, all known virulence factors (14Reed M.B. Domenech P. Manca C. Su H. Barczak A.K. Kreiswirth B.N. Kaplan G.

We propose a model for how distinct M. tuberculosis strains differ fundamentally in their macrophage interaction, a factor that may contribute to the increased representation of specific M. tuberculosis clones globally that impact the spectrum of human infections and disease. Chemical Reagents and Antibodies—All chemical reagents were of the highest grade from Sigma unless otherwise specified. CS-35 and CS-40 murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were kindly provided by both the Tuberculosis Research Materials and Vaccine Testing contract (NOI-AI-75320) and Leprosy Research Support contract (NOI-AI-25469). Growth Conditions of M. tuberculosis Strains—Randomly selected M. tuberculosis clinical isolates (HN731, HN804, HN885, HN1390, HN1538, and HN1554 from PGG-1; HN657, HN703, and HN810 from PGG-2; and HN362 from PGG-3) were recovered from patients in Houston, TX, and characterized as described (8Sreevatsan S. Pan X. Stockbauer K.E. Connell N.D. Kreiswirth B.N. Whittam T.S. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9869-9874Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 17Sreevatsan S.

Microbiol. 1996; 34: 2007-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis Erdman (ATCC 35801, within PGG-2) and H37Rv (ATCC 27294, within PGG-3) laboratory strains were also studied. Working stocks of all M. tuberculosis strains were grown on 7H11 plates and used as single suspensions, as described (18Schlesinger L.S. Bellinger-Kawahara C.G. Payne N.R. Horwitz M.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2771-2780PubMed Google Scholar). Single cell suspensions were confirmed by high power light microscopy, repeating colony-forming unit (CFU) assays several times to correlate the numbers of bacteria counted in the Petroff-Hausser chamber with CFUs and performing tissue culture assays to ensure that the different clinical isolates settled comparably (similar buoyancies). Isolation and Preparation of Human Macrophages—Monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) monolayers were prepared from healthy tuberculin-negative human volunteers, as described (19Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2920-2930PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayers (2 × 105 MDMs) for microscopy and CFUs were obtained by adherence to acid-washed glass coverslips or directly to plastic, respectively, in 24-well tissue culture plates for 2 h at 37 °C. Assay of M. tuberculosis Association with MDMs—M. tuberculosis association assays with human MDM monolayers were performed as previously described (19Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2920-2930PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MDM monolayers on coverslips in RPMI (BD Biosciences) containing 20 mm Hepes (RH) and 2.5% autologous human serum or RPMI containing 20 mm Hepes and 1 mg/ml human serum albumin (RHH) were incubated with M. tuberculosis single suspensions (2 × 106 bacilli) for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. MDM monolayers were washed to remove nonassociated bacilli, fixed in 10% formalin, and washed again, and then associated M. tuberculosis bacilli were stained with auramine-rhodamine. The mean ± S.E. of cell-associated bacilli/MDM on triplicate coverslips was determined by counting ≥300 consecutive MDMs per coverslip using phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy (19Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2920-2930PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, MDMs were preincubated with anti-MR antibody (AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC) at 10 μg/ml for 20 min at 37 °C to block the activity of the MR, as previously described (2Kang P.B. Azad A.K. Torrelles J.B. Kaufman T.M. Beharka A. Tibesar E. Desjardin L.E. Schlesinger L.S. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 3Torrelles J.B. Azad A.K. Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For association with CR3 (complement receptor 3), CHO CR3 cells (1 × 105; provided by Douglas Golenbock, University of Massachusetts Medical School) were adhered to glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Washed monolayers were incubated with either M. tuberculosis strain Erdman or HN885 in either RH containing 2.5% human serum or RHH at 37 °C for 2 h. Infected monolayers were washed, fixed, and stained, and bacteria/cell was assessed as described above. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of Strains Erdman and HN885 in Macrophages—M. tuberculosis bacilli (1 × 106) were added to MDM monolayers on glass coverslips and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Without washing, monolayers were fixed with 2.5% gluteraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 10 min, followed by 1 h in fresh fixative. Coverslip staining and TEM analysis of attachment and internalization of strains HN885 and Erdman by the macrophage was performed as previously described (19Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2920-2930PubMed Google Scholar) using a Hitachi H-7000 transmission electron microscope. Five grids for each sample were analyzed by counting a total of 250–300 consecutive bacilli (∼50 MDM cross-sections), and the ratio of intracellular versus extracellular surface-attached M. tuberculosis was determined. Whole Cell ELISA for ManLAM on the M. tuberculosis Surface—Live M. tuberculosis single cell suspensions (5 × 105) were added to each well (triplicate wells) of a 96-well tissue culture plate and dried. Wells were blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated in either anti-LAM CS35 or CS40 mAb in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at room temperature. Then wells were washed and incubated with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad) in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed and developed using a peroxidase substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Reactions were stopped with 1% oxalic acid, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Three independent experiments were performed. Total Lipid, ManLAM Purifications, Electrophoresis, Western Blotting, and Size Fractionation—Extraction of total lipids and ManLAM purifications were performed as previously reported (20Torrelles J.B. Khoo K.H. Sieling P.A. Modlin R.L. Zhang N. Marques A.M. Treumann A. Rithner C.D. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol.

Pure ManLAM fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis using 10–20% gradient Tris/Tricine gels followed by periodic acid-silver staining. Sample concentrations were 0.5 μg/μl sample buffer.

Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using a chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Deacylation of ManLAMs and sizing chromatography using a 1 × 120-cm Bio-Gel P-100 (Bio-Rad) column were performed as previously described (24Berg S. Starbuck J. Torrelles J.B. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5651-5663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fractions were dried, and carbohydrate content was determined following the Dubois method (25Dubois M. Gilles K. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Nature. 1951; 168: 167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Monosaccharide Composition and High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography (HPAEC) Analyses—Samples were hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid and converted to alditol acetates using scyllo-inositol as internal standard. Gas chromatography (GC) was performed as described (20Torrelles J.B. Khoo K.H. Sieling P.A. Modlin R.L. Zhang N. Marques A.M. Treumann A. Rithner C.D. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41227-41239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For HPAEC analyses, mixtures of ManLAM/LM from each strain were digested with endorabinanase and analyzed as previously described (20Torrelles J.B. Khoo K.H. Sieling P.A. Modlin R.L. Zhang N.

Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS Analyses—Analyses by MALDI-TOF MS were carried out on a Bruker Daltonic Reflex III (Bruker Daltonic) mass spectrometer. ManLAMs (0.5 μl of 10 μg/μl) were mixed with 0.5 μl of matrix solution (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB; 10 μg/μl) in a mixture of water/ethanol (1:1, v/v) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and air-dried. MALDI-TOF spectra were acquired in negative linear mode detection between 10,000 and 25,000 m/z and using a 300-ns time delay with a grid voltage of 80% of full accelerating voltage (25 kV) and guide wire voltage of 0.15%. For PIMs, MALDI-MS analyses were performed as previously described in positive mode (26McCarthy T.R. Torrelles J.B. Macfarlane A.S. Katawczik M. Kutzbach B. Desjardin L.E. Clegg S. Goldberg J.B. Schlesinger L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 774-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). NMR Spectrometry of ManLAMs—Two-dimensional 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker 600-MHz NMR spectrometer using the supplied Bruker pulse sequences. ManLAM samples were dissolved at 15 mg/ml in 100% D2O as analytically quantified by GC analyses and lyophilized several times prior to experiments. HSQC data were acquired with a 7-kHz window for protons in F2 and a 15-kHz window for carbon in F1 with a total cycle time of 1.65 s between transients, as previously reported (20Torrelles J.B. Khoo K.H. Sieling P.A. Modlin R.L. Zhang N. Marques A.M. Treumann A. Rithner C.D. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41227-41239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Adiabatic decoupling was performed to carbon during proton acquisition. The final resolution was 3.5 Hz/point in F2 and 15 Hz/point in F1. Intracellular Growth of Strains Erdman and HN885 in Macrophages—For measurements of intracellular growth in macrophages, 12-day-old MDM monolayers were washed, and M. tuberculosis bacilli were added to MDMs (multiplicity of infection 1:1; duplicate wells) in either RH containing 2.5% serum or RHH and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (27Olakanmi O. Britigan B.E. Schlesinger L.S. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5619-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Infected monolayers were washed and either repleted with RH containing 1% human autologous serum and further incubated for 24, 48, or 72 h or lysed (0 h time point) as described (27Olakanmi O. Britigan B.E. Schlesinger L.S. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5619-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). After the 0 time point, the supernatant (containing detached infected MDMs) and monolayers were lysed separately and then pooled. Lysed samples were diluted, and then duplicates of three dilutions for each group were plated on 7H11 agar plates for 2–6 weeks (colony counts were identical within this interval). CFUs and doubling times were determined. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (available on the World Wide Web). Association of M. tuberculosis Clinical Isolates with Primary Human Macrophages—We generated single cell suspensions (18Schlesinger L.S. Bellinger-Kawahara C.G. Payne N.R. Horwitz M.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2771-2780PubMed Google Scholar), and using the same multiplicity of infection (10:1), we evaluated the macrophage association patterns of randomly selected strains from each of the three PGGs in the presence or absence of fresh nonimmune autologous serum. Fig. 1A shows a representative experiment for the association of HN885 and HN1554 clinical isolates versus the Erdman strain in the presence (solid bars) or absence (open bars) of serum. Our results showed that only strains HN885, HN1554, and, to a lesser extent, HN1538 were significantly reduced in macrophage association with or without serum relative to the control strain Erdman (Fig. 1B). Regardless of the PGG, all clinical isolates analyzed had a greater association (2–3-fold) with human MDMs in the presence of serum relative to the no serum condition (Fig. 1B), as previously shown for M. tuberculosis strains Erdman, H37Rv and H37Ra (19Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2920-2930PubMed Google Scholar). To further analyze the result for the HN885 and HN1554 strains, we determined that the reduced association was observed regardless of the age of the bacterial culture used (standard 9 days versus 3 weeks) and the multiplicity of infection. Also, we determined that there was no difference in the degree of bacterial clumping or the stability of the bacterial phenotype (several serial passages on plates) (data not shown). Under all conditions, the reduction in bacterial association was greatest for strain HN885. Receptor-mediated Phagocytosis for Strains Erdman, HN885, and HN1554—A highly expressed pattern recognition receptor on alveolar macrophages is the MR (28Wileman T.E. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Proc.

We previously showed that the MR directly participates in the phagocytosis of virulent M. tuberculosis strains, defining a unique pathway for their intracellular trafficking (2Kang P.B. Azad A.K.

Immunol. 1993; 150: 2920-2930PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we tested if the low association with human macrophages observed for HN885 and HN1554 was due to a deficiency in the recognition by the MR by using an anti-MR mAb (2Kang P.B. Azad A.K. Torrelles J.B. Kaufman T.M. Beharka A. Tibesar E. Desjardin L.E. Schlesinger L.S. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 3Torrelles J.B. Azad A.K. Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1805-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 2A show a representative experiment in the absence (open bars) or presence (solid bars) of anti-MR mAb, and results in Fig. 2B show combined data from three independent experiments. Whereas the association of strains Erdman and H37Rv with macrophages was significantly reduced when MDMs were pretreated with MR mAb (40.3 ± 8.4 and 47.8 ± 7.2%, respectively), the association of strains HN885 and HN1554 was minimally reduced in the presence of MR mAb (13.3 ± 8.2 and 5.1 ± 3.7%, respectively). Taken together, these data provide evidence that whereas strains Erdman and H37Rv engage the macrophage MR to optimize association with the macrophage (19Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2920-2930PubMed Google Scholar), strains HN885 and HN1554 do not. The results suggested that these clinical isolates have an alteration(s) in their mannosylated cell wall molecules (i.e. reduction of ManLAM and higher order PIMs, both known MR ligands) that impaired their recognition by the MR. CR3 is also a major receptor involved in M. tuberculosis phagocytosis by human macrophages in both the absence and presence (via C3 deposition) of serum (18Schlesinger L.S. Bellinger-Kawahara C.G. Payne N.R. Horwitz M.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2771-2780PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that there is no difference in the magnitude or nature of C3 fragment deposition on strains Erdman and HN885 or in the association with CR3 (supplemental Fig. 1). We next studied whether the low association with macrophages observed for HN885 also translated into a defect in macrophage internalization (phagocytosis) of bacilli. Using TEM (19Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2920-2930PubMed Google Scholar), we found that only under nonopsonic conditions (data for the opsonic condition is not shown) was there a significant difference (*, p < 0.05, n = 3) between Erdman and HN885 strains in that 89.6 ± 0.6% of strain Erdman was internalized after 2 h of infection, whereas only 58.0 ± 10.6% of strain HN885 was internalized (Fig. 2C). This result indicated that the defect in association observed for HN885 was also accompanied by a defect in phagocytosis under nonopsonic conditions, where the difference between strains HN885 and Erdman is in use of the MR by the latter strain. Analysis of ManLAM on the Surface of Strains HN885 and HN1554—Since ManLAM is the major M. tuberculosis cell envelope ligand for the MR, we next assessed whether strains HN885 and HN1554 are deficient in cell surface exposure of ManLAM. ELISA and flow cytometry experiments were performed using anti-LAM mAbs (CS-35 and CS-40) (21Kaur D. Lowary T.L. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Chatterjee D. Lowell K. Rivoire B. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6234-6239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The whole cell ELISA results using CS-35 and CS-40 (Fig. 2D) showed a significant reduction in the recognition of surface ManLAM on strains HN885 and HN1554 (p < 0.0001), a result confirmed by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. 2). Analysis of cell lysates by SDS-PAGE and Western blot based on loading protein equivalents demonstrated that the ManLAM content was equivalent among all strains (data not shown). Thus, the reduced exposure of ManLAM observed on the surface of HN885 and HN554 appeared to be due to an alteration in their ManLAM structure and/or location. Size and Molecular Composition of ManLAMs from Strains HN885 and HN1554—To examine for structural alterations present in ManLAMs from strains HN885 and HN1554, these were extracted and purified by size exclusion chromatrography as we previously described (20Torrelles J.B.

https://openalex.org/W2159431004,"Claudin family transmembrane proteins play an important role in tight junction structure and function in epithelial cells. Among the 24 isoforms identified in mice and humans, claudin-4 and -3 serve as the receptor for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (Cpe). The second extracellular loop (Ecl2) of claudin-4 is responsible for the binding to the C-terminal 30 amino acids of Cpe (Cpe30). To define the structural constraints for the claudin-4/Cpe30 interaction, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method was developed. GST fusions with claudin-4 revealed that Ecl2 with the downstream transmembrane domain of claudin-4 reconstituted the basic structural requirement for optimal binding activity to Cpe30, with affinity in the nanomolar range. Two 12-mer peptides selected by phage display against claudin-4-transfected CHO cells and a 12-mer Cpe mutant peptide also showed significant affinity for claudin-4 with this SPR assay, suggesting that a short peptide can establish stable contact with Ecl2 with nanomolar affinity. Alignment of these short peptides unveiled a common Ecl2 binding motif: <XX(Y/W)(X)(3 or 4)Y(Y/X)(L/I)XX>. Whereas the short peptides bound native claudin-4 on transfected CHO cells in pull-down assays, only the larger Cpe30 peptide affected trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TER) in peptide-treated Caco-2BBe monolayers. Importantly, Cpe30 retained its binding to claudin-4 when fused to the C terminus of influenza hemagglutinin, demonstrating that its binding activity can be maintained in a different biochemical context. These studies may help in the design of assays for membrane receptor interactions with soluble ligands, and in applying new targeting ligands to delivering attached ""cargo"" proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1989324958,"Nitric oxide and nitrovasodilators induce vascular smooth muscle cell relaxation in part by cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (PKG-Ialpha)-mediated activation of myosin phosphatase (MLCP). Mechanistically it has been proposed that protein-protein interactions between the N-terminal leucine zipper (LZ) domain of PKG-Ialpha ((PKG-Ialpha(1-59)) and the LZ and/or coiled coil (CC) domain of the myosin binding subunit (MBS) of MLCP are localized in the C terminus of MBS. Although recent studies have supported these interactions, the critical amino acids responsible for these interactions have not been identified. Here we present structural and biophysical data identifying that the LZ domain of PKG-Ialpha(1-59) interacts with a well defined 42-residue CC motif (MBS(CT42)) within the C terminus of MBS. Using glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments, chemical cross-linking, size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism, and isothermal titration calorimetry we identified a weak dimer-dimer interaction between PKG-Ialpha(1-59) and this C-terminal CC domain of MBS. The K(d) of this non-covalent complex is 178.0+/-1.5 microm. Furthermore our (1)H-(15)N heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR data illustrate that this interaction is mediated by several PKG-Ialpha residues that are on the a, d, e, and g hydrophobic and electrostatic interface of the C-terminal heptad layers 2, 4, and 5 of PKG-Ialpha. Taken together these data support a role for the LZ domain of PKG-Ialpha and the CC domain of MBS in this requisite contractile complex."
https://openalex.org/W1990137851,"The number of distinct signaling pathways that can transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a single cell type is unclear. Using a single strain of human mammary epithelial cells, we found that a wide variety of agonists, such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), uridine triphosphate, growth hormone, vascular endothelial growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, require EGFR activity to induce ERK phosphorylation. In contrast, hepatocyte growth factor can stimulate ERK phosphorylation independent of the EGFR. EGFR transactivation also correlated with an increase in cell proliferation and could be inhibited with metalloprotease inhibitors. However, there were significant differences with respect to transactivation kinetics and sensitivity to different inhibitors. In particular, IGF-1 displayed relatively slow transactivation kinetics and was resistant to inhibition by the selective ADAM-17 inhibitor WAY-022 compared with LPA-induced transactivation. Studies using anti-ligand antibodies showed that IGF-1 transactivation required amphiregulin production, whereas LPA was dependent on multiple ligands. Direct measurement of ligand shedding confirmed that LPA treatment stimulated shedding of multiple EGFR ligands, but paradoxically, IGF-1 had little effect on the shedding rate of any ligand, including amphiregulin. Instead, IGF-1 appeared to work by enhancing EGFR activation of Ras in response to constitutively produced amphiregulin. This enhancement of EGFR signaling was independent of both receptor phosphorylation and PI-3-kinase activity, suggestive of a novel mechanism. Our studies demonstrate that within a single cell type, the EGFR autocrine system can couple multiple signaling pathways to ERK activation and that this modulation of EGFR autocrine signaling can be accomplished at multiple regulatory steps."
https://openalex.org/W2055432250,"Given the difficulty of testing evolutionary and ecological theory in situ, in vitro model systems are attractive alternatives; however, can we appraise whether an experimental result is particular to the in vitro model, and, if so, characterize the systems likely to behave differently and understand why? Here we examine these issues using the relationship between phenotypic diversity and resource input in the T7-Escherichia coli co-evolving system as a case history. We establish a mathematical model of this interaction, framed as one instance of a super-class of host-parasite co-evolutionary models, and show that it captures experimental results. By tuning this model, we then ask how diversity as a function of resource input could behave for alternative co-evolving partners (for example, E. coli with lambda bacteriophages). In contrast to populations lacking bacteriophages, variation in diversity with differences in resources is always found for co-evolving populations, supporting the geographic mosaic theory of co-evolution. The form of this variation is not, however, universal. Details of infectivity are pivotal: in T7-E. coli with a modified gene-for-gene interaction, diversity is low at high resource input, whereas, for matching-allele interactions, maximal diversity is found at high resource input. A combination of in vitro systems and appropriately configured mathematical models is an effective means to isolate results particular to the in vitro system, to characterize systems likely to behave differently and to understand the biology underpinning those alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W2019478986,"Irga6, a myristoylated, interferon-inducible member of the immunity-related GTPase family, contributes to disease resistance against Toxoplasma gondii in mice. Accumulation of Irga6 on the T. gondii parasitophorous vacuole membrane is associated with vesiculation and ultimately disruption of the vacuolar membrane in a process that requires an intact GTP-binding domain. The role of the GTP-binding domain of Irga6 in pathogen resistance is, however, unclear. We provide evidence that Irga6 in interferon-induced, uninfected cells is predominantly in a GDP-bound state that is maintained by other interferon-induced proteins. However, Irga6 that accumulates on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane after Toxoplasma infection is in the GTP-bound form. We demonstrate that a monoclonal antibody, 10D7, specifically detects GTP-bound Irga6, and we show that the formation of the 10D7 epitope follows from a GTP-dependent conformational transition of the N terminus of Irga6, anticipating an important role of the myristoyl group on Irga6 function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2024175809,"The production of fully immunologically competent humanized mice engrafted with peripheral lymphocyte populations provides a model for in vivo testing of new vaccines, the durability of immunological memory and cancer therapies. This approach is limited, however, by the failure to efficiently engraft human B lymphocytes in immunodeficient mice. We hypothesized that this deficiency was due to the failure of the murine microenvironment to support human B cell survival. We report that while the human B lymphocyte survival factor, B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS/BAFF) enhances the survival of human B cells ex vivo, murine BLyS has no such protective effect. Although human B cells bound both human and murine BLyS, nuclear accumulation of NF-kappaB p52, an indication of the induction of a protective anti-apoptotic response, following stimulation with human BLyS was more robust than that induced with murine BLyS suggesting a fundamental disparity in BLyS receptor signaling. Efficient engraftment of both human B and T lymphocytes in NOD rag1(-/-) Prf1(-/-) immunodeficient mice treated with recombinant human BLyS is observed after adoptive transfer of human PBL relative to PBS treated controls. Human BLyS treated recipients had on average 40-fold higher levels of serum Ig than controls and mounted a de novo antibody response to the thymus-independent antigens in pneumovax vaccine. The data indicate that production of fully immunologically competent humanized mice from PBL can be markedly facilitated by providing human BLyS."
https://openalex.org/W1986372661,"Primary hyperoxaluria type I is a severe kidney stone disease caused by mutations in the protein alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT). Many patients have mutations in AGT that are not deleterious alone but act synergistically with a common minor allele polymorphic variant to impair protein folding, dimerization, or localization. Although studies suggest that the minor allele variant itself is destabilized, no direct stability studies have been carried out. In this report, we analyze AGT function and stability using three approaches. First, we describe a yeast complementation growth assay for AGT, in which we show that human AGT can substitute for function of yeast Agx1 and that mutations associated with disease in humans show reduced growth in yeast. The reduced growth of minor allele mutants reflects reduced protein levels, indicating that these proteins are less stable than wild-type AGT in yeast. We further examine stability of AGT alleles in vitro using two direct methods, a mass spectrometry-based technique (stability of unpurified proteins from rates of H/D exchange) and differential scanning fluorimetry. We also examine the effect of known ligands pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and aminooxyacetic acid on stability. Our work establishes that the minor allele is destabilized and that pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and aminooxyacetic acid binding significantly stabilizes both alleles. To our knowledge, this is the first work that directly measures relative stabilities of AGT variants and ligand complexes. Because previous studies suggest that stabilizing compounds (i.e. pharmacological chaperones) may be effective for treatment of primary hyperoxaluria, we propose that the methods described here can be used in high throughput screens for compounds that stabilize AGT mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2010061088,"During human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, there is a strong positive correlation between CCL2 levels and HIV viral load. To determine whether CCL2 alters HIV-1 infection of resting CD4(+) T cells, we infected purified resting CD4(+) T cells after incubation with CCL2. We show that CCL2 up-regulates CXCR4 on resting CD4(+) T cells in a CCR2-dependent mechanism, and that this augmentation of CXCR4 expression by CCL2 increases the ability of these cells to be chemoattracted to CXCR4 using gp120 and renders them more permissive to X4-tropic HIV-1 infection. Thus, CCL2 has the capacity to render a large population of lymphocytes more susceptible to HIV-1 late in the course of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2024499827,"Mucosal epithelial cells in the respiratory tract act as the first line of host innate defense against inhaled microbes by producing a range of molecules for clearance. In particular, epithelial mucins facilitate the mucociliary clearance by physically trapping the inhaled microbes. Up-regulation of mucin production thus represents an important host innate defense response against invading microbes. Excess mucin production, however, overwhelms the mucociliary clearance, resulting in defective mucosal defenses. Thus, tight regulation of mucin production is critical for maintaining an appropriate balance between beneficial and detrimental outcomes. Among various mechanisms, negative regulation plays an important role in tightly regulating mucin production. Here we show that the PAK4-JNK signaling pathway acted as a negative regulator for Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin-induced MUC5AC mucin transcription. Moreover pneumolysin also selectively induced expression of MKP1 via a TLR4-dependent MyD88-TRAF6-ERK signaling pathway, which inhibited the PAK4-JNK signaling pathway, thereby leading to up-regulation of MUC5AC mucin production to maintain effective mucosal protection against S. pneumoniae infection. These studies provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the tight regulation of mucin overproduction in the pathogenesis of airway infectious diseases and may lead to development of new therapeutic strategies."

Our analysis presents a complete model of glycoprotein recognition and provides a basis for the structure-based design of novel Streptococcus vaccines and therapeutics. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive human commensal that typically colonizes the respiratory epithelium. Carriage of the bacterium, although potentially asymptomatic, often progresses to a pathogenic state causing otitis media, pneumonia, septicaemia, and/or meningitis. Worldwide, S. pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality; pneumococcal infections have been estimated to result in over one million pneumonia-related deaths per year (1Bogaert D. de Groot R. Hermans P.W.M. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2004; 4: 144-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Polysaccharide-based vaccines are only relatively effective; poor efficacy in young and immunodeficient patients, the large number (>90) of S. pneumoniae serotypes, and the increased prevalence of non-vaccine serotypes complicates vaccination strategies. Furthermore, the emergence of increased antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae raises the specter of an increasing public health threat (2Adam D. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2002; 50: S1-S5Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3Levy S.B. Marshall B. Nat.

The ability to degrade extracellular glycoproteins may aid colonization in at least two ways. Firstly, the destruction of the mucin barrier may aid persistence, and secondly, the utilization of liberated glycans as a fermentable carbon source may improve the growth conditions for this pathogen (4Burnaugh A.M.

SpGH101 is exported to the extracellular environment by virtue of a YSIRK-G/S motif containing secretion signal. Although the enzyme has been observed as a soluble protein in the culture medium after growth in vitro (6Glasgow L.R. Paulson J.C. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8615-8623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has also been shown to be localized at the S. pneumoniae cell surface by cell surface staining and opsonophagocytic killing assays (7Giefing C.

Med. 2008; 205: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The cell surface localization is presumably a consequence of the C-terminal LPXTG sortase signal. This motif, followed by a predicted transmembrane domain and a charged C terminus, is indicative of covalent anchoring of the enzyme to the peptidoglycan cell wall (8Desvaux M. Dumas E. Chafsey I.

Further, the identity of catalytically important amino acids was inferred by mutagenesis of conserved aspartic and glutamic acid residues; mutation of Asp-682, Asp-789, and Glu-822 (corresponding to Asp-658, Asp-764, and Glu-796 in SpGH101) induced a significant reduction in enzymatic activity.

Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the spgh101/pCWori+ construct were grown in M9 medium supplemented with 50 mg·dm–3 l-selenomethionine and containing 100 μg·ml–1 ampicillin.SpGH101-(40–1567) was purified by sequential use of Ni2+ affinity, anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and size exclusion chromatography to >95% purity, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. The His6 tag was removed by cleavage of the fusion protein with thrombin prior to the anion exchange step. The activity of SpGH101-(40–1567) was confirmed by using a UV spectrophotometric assay to monitor the release of 2,4-dinitrophenol from Galβ(1,3)GalNAcαDNP.Crystallization—Crystals of SeMet-substituted SpGH101-(40–1567) were grown by using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Drops consisted of 1 μl of protein (10 mg·ml–1) and 1 μl of reservoir solution (29% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000, 0.2 m lithium citrate, and 0.1 m ammonium acetate) and were equilibrated at 21 °C.Data Collection and Structure Determination—Cryoprotection was accomplished by sequential transfer into solutions of 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m lithium citrate, and 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, containing 5% (v/v) glycerol and 10% (v/v) glycerol.

Open table in a new tab The final model contains residues 119–307, 319–1439, and 1451–1476 (chain A) and 122–222, 226–307, and 318–1481 (chain B). The electron density for domains 1–6 is, in general, of better quality in chain A. Notably, the electron density for domain 7 is of better quality in chain B, although this domain exhibits electron density of lower quality than the remainder of the structure. With the exception of domain 7, our analysis is based on the structure of chain A. Four features in the electron density were modeled as Ca2+ ions based upon coordination geometry and distance (21Harding M.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Additional features were modeled as Na+ ions, based upon the same criteria, and glycerol molecules, although we note the electron density in these regions is not definitive, and these assignments should be regarded as provisional. Both chain A and chain B exhibited an unidentified peak of electron density at the periphery of the protein, distant from the active site, near Ser-1127, that was unmodeled. We also note that short sections of electron density in the 308–318 linker region and areas of domain 7, although visible, were ambiguous and therefore were not modeled.Model validation was performed using MolProbity (22Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

Ramachandran analysis indicates the final model contains 96.2, 3.7, and 0.1% of residues in favored, allowed, and disallowed regions, respectively. The figures were prepared using PyMOL (23DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Version 1, DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar), and electrostatic potentials were calculated using APBS (24Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This model was manually positioned in the active site of SpGH101-(40–1567) using the superposed Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 α-amylase in complex with a substrate (2D0H (26Abe A. Yoshida H. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. Kamitori S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6145-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)) as a template. The Galβ(1,3)GalNAcαThr coordinates were then subjected to energy minimization using CNS (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe structure of SpGH101-(40–1567) can be traced between residues 119 and 1481 with a break in a linker region from residues 308 to 317. The overall architecture of SpGH101-(40–1567) (Fig. 1 and supplemental movie 1) comprises seven distinct domains. The N-terminal domain, residues 124–306, is a twisted β-sandwich composed of two sheets of six and seven antiparallel β-strands. The domain is structurally similar to the legume lectin-type fold (Dali Z-scores (28Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar): 2RHP (29Carlson C.B.

Biol. 2008; 161: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), 11.5), although notably, the extended metal and carbohydrate-binding loops appear to be missing. The absence of these loop regions exposes a deeper channel similar to the active site of the alginate lyases of polysaccharide lyase family PL7 (Dali Z-scores: 2ZAA, 11.1; 1VAV (33Yamasaki M. Moriwaki S. Miyake O. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Mikami B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31863-31872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), 10.9). At the base of the cleft, four phenylalanine residues are exposed to solvent and may play a role in carbohydrate recognition. In the crystallized structure, domain 1 is positioned directly over the active site of the glycoside hydrolase domain (domain 3). The extended linker (residues 307–329) between domains 1 and 2 and the poor ordering of domain 1 in chain B implies that this orientation is most likely a crystallographic artifact. Based upon these observations, it is possible that domain 1 may function as a non-catalytic carbohydrate-binding module. Via the linker, this may anchor the main body of the enzyme in the mucin layer of the respiratory epithelium in a manner analogous to that proposed for the structurally similar legume lectin-type domains of the Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (34Crennell S. Garman E. Laver G. Vimr E. Taylor G. Structure (Camb.). 1994; 2: 535-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Domain 2, residues 330–597, comprises a supersandwich fold of two antiparallel sheets. This exhibits the strongest structural similarity to the galactose mutarotase-like fold; however, comparison with a galactose mutarotase (Dali Z-score: 1SO0 (35Thoden J.B. Timson D.J. Reece R.J. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23431-23437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), 12.7) reveals that the loops constituting the active site are absent and that the active site residues are not conserved. In place of the defined galactose mutarotase active site pocket, domain 2 exhibits a channel along the concave surface of the supersandwich fold similar to the proposed substrate-binding cleft in the periplasmic domain of YidC (Dali Z-score: 3BS6 (36Ravaud S. Stjepanovic G. Wild K. Sinning I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9350-9358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), 13.0). Although the function of this domain remains unclear in SpGH101, structurally similar domains are found in a number of glycoside hydrolases where they may confer stability to the multidomain architectures and/or be a relic of multifunctional ancestry.The catalytic glycoside hydrolase domain (domain 3), residues 602–893, displays a distorted (β/α)8 barrel fold with three helices and strands replaced by a complex arrangement of loops. Overall, the domain displays the strongest structural similarity to the catalytic domains of the glycoside hydrolases of family GH13 (Dali Z-scores: 1GVI (37Lee H.-S. Kim M.-S. Cho H.-S. Kim J.-I.

Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. Kamitori S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6145-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), 15.2; 1VB9 (38Mizuno M. Tonozuka T. Uechi A. Ohtaki A. Ichikawa K. Kamitori S. Nishikawa A. Sakano Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2530-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), 15.1). Notably, the catalytic domain is most similar to the α-amylases, enzymes that also catalyze the hydrolysis of α-linked carbohydrates via a double displacement mechanism. The catalytic domain of SpGH101 possesses a subdomain, residues 699–733, in common with many α-amylases. This decoration, apparently lacking the typical structural Ca2+-binding site, defines one extremity of the active site cleft. Significant further insight can be gained by superposing the catalytic domain with the structure of the α-amylase from T. vulgaris R-47 in complex with a substrate (2D0H, supplemental Fig. S1a) (26Abe A. Yoshida H. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. Kamitori S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6145-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The α-amylase nucleophile and general acid/base catalytic residues, Asp-356 and Glu-396, respectively, superpose directly with residues Asp-764 and Glu-796 of SpGH101. The third residue implicated in SpGH101 catalysis, Asp-658, superposes with Tyr-223 of the α-amylase, a residue proposed to facilitate hydrophobic interactions with the carbohydrate bound in the –1 subsite. The active site (Fig. 2) appears negatively charged and possesses numerous polar residues capable of interacting with the substrate carbohydrate hydroxyl groups. The size of the well defined active site pocket in the enzyme surface, its extremities delimited on one side by Trp-724 and Trp-726, is consistent with the observed disaccharide substrate specificity. The opposite side of the cleft is bordered by a loop (Trp-867 and Gln-868) that appears less ordered, the flexibility of which may aid substrate binding.FIGURE 2A stereo representation of the SpGH101 active site. The modeled Galβ(1,3)GalNAcαThr substrate is shown as a ball-and-stick representation in yellow, surrounded by its ligands in the active site of SpGH101.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using the superposed α-amylase-substrate complex as a template, we have modeled the Galβ(1,3)GalNAcαThr substrate in the active site of SpGH101 (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). The postulated nucleophile and general acid/base residues, Asp-764 and Glu-796 respectively, are positioned well with respect to their catalytic roles. This model is consistent with the observed substrate specificity of the B. longum endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (5Fujita K. Oura F. Nagamine N. Katayama T. Hiratake J. Sakata K. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37415-37422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and the residues surrounding the active site show a high level of sequence identity (supplemental Fig. S2). Asp-658 is well placed to interact with the GalNAc 4-hydroxyl in this model, a binding contribution that may explain the significant loss of activity upon mutation of this residue and the observed intolerance of GlcNAc in the –1 subsite. Although our model provides insight into the carbohydrate-binding site, the seemingly fortuitous positioning of domain 1 provides a model of potential interaction with the substrate protein moiety.The domain neighboring the catalytic domain (domain 4), residues 894–1043, constitutes an extensive antiparallel β-sheet structure that effectively shields one side of the catalytic domain from solvent. Analogous, albeit structurally dissimilar, β-sheet domains are also observed in comparable locations with respect to the catalytic domain in α-amylase structures. These domains have been proposed to stabilize the catalytic domain, in particular the secondary structural elements influencing the active site. It seems feasible that domain 4 of SpGH101 could serve a similar purpose.Domains 5 and 6, residues 1058–1213 and 1214–1417, respectively, possess comparable β-sandwich jelly roll folds comprised of two sheets of five antiparallel β-strands. Although the core jelly roll fold of both domains is similar and both domains present a concave solvent exposed surface, domain 6 possesses more extensive loop regions interconnecting the β-strands. Domain 5 exhibits structural similarity to the carbohydrate-binding modules (for review, see Ref. 39Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar) of families CBM16 (Dali Z-score: 2ZEY (40Bae B. Ohene-Adjei S. Kocherginskaya S. Mackie R.I. Spies M.A. Cann I.K.O. Nair S.K. J.

Kilburn D.G. Davies G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), 11.5; 1K42 (42Simpson P.J. Jamieson S.J. Abou-Hachem M. Nordberg Karlsson E. Gilbert H.J. Holst O. Williamson M.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5712-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), 10.5). The shallow cleft of SpGH101 domain 5 most closely resembles that of the CBM16 protein. The extended loops that form the more prominent substrate-binding clefts of the CBM4 proteins are absent. The putative binding site in domain 5 is lined predominantly by hydrophilic residues and is devoid of the aromatic side chains that are commonly associated with carbohydrate recognition. Domain 5 also displays structural similarity to the carbohydrate-binding domain of the F-box protein of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Fbs1, Dali Z-score: 2E32 (43Mizushima T. Yoshida Y. Kumanomidou T. Hasegawa Y. Suzuki A. Yamane T. Tanaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5777-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), 11.1). The Fbs1 carbohydrate-binding domain displays a significantly different mode of substrate binding to the proteins of families CBM16 and CBM4; solvent-exposed aromatic residues in loop regions distant to the CBM16 and CBM4 clefts provide a shelf for carbohydrate recognition. This mode of substrate binding appears unlikely in domain 5 of SpGH101; however, as such aromatic residues are absent. Domain 6 is structurally similar to the carbohydrate-binding modules of families CBM22 and CBM16 (Dali Z-scores: 1H6X (44Xie H. Gilbert H.J. Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Williamson M.P. Simpson P.J.

It is, however, unclear as to whether the extended loops in domain 6 could form a similar substrate-binding site, as has been found with these structurally similar carbohydrate-binding modules. Indeed, the formation of a defined surface cleft would require flexibility of at least one loop, and such a movement would expose a number of hydrophobic residues to solvent. Notably, the calcium-binding site observed in these CBMs is conserved in SpGH101 domain 6. Domains 5 and 6 may therefore act as carbohydrate recognition domains, but in the absence of binding data, we note that it is also possible that these β-sandwich domains have no role in carbohydrate binding as has been previously observed (46Sulzenbacher G. Bignon C. Nishimura T. Tarling C.A. Withers S.G. Henrissat B. Bourne Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13119-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is possible that these domains serve entirely structural functions to stabilize the overall protein architecture.The final domain in the structure, residues 1421–1481, is a helical bundle comprising three α-helices that forms an interface between symmetry-related molecules. In addition to the seven domains described by our structural studies, a further domain (residues 1497–1622) is predicted between domain 7 and the cell wall anchor that, from primary sequence analysis, is predicted to be a member of carbohydrate-binding module family CBM32. Overall therefore, SpGH101 possesses four potential carbohydrate-binding modules. These domains may serve to either position the enzyme on the cell wall or within the Streptococcus polysaccharide capsule or enable multivalent binding of the enzyme, and thus bacterium, to the epithelial mucin layer.The vaccines currently clinically available against S. pneumoniae offer only partial protection against pneumococcal diseases across both developed and developing countries. The 23-valent capsular polysaccharide-based vaccine is limited by its low efficacy in children under 2 years of age and in immunodeficient patients, whereas the 7-valent conjugate vaccine, although showing greater efficacy in young children, is limited by its narrow serotype coverage (47Bogaert D.

The expanding use of synthetic dyes such as triphenylmethane, azo, and anthraquinone is alarming, given that the release of colored compounds into the environment may cause substantial ecological damage, not only due to their color, which may have an impact on photosynthesis in aquatic plants, but also because many dyes and their breakdown products may be toxic and/or mutagenic to living organisms (1Weisburger J.H.

Partial biochemical studies of the decolorization of triphenylmethane dyes have been carried out in fungi. These studies revealed that the laccase, peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase enzymes from fungi are involved in the decolorization of dyes (10Tekere M. Mswaka A.Y. Zvauya R. Read J.S. Enzyme Microb.

Recently, a novel dye-decolorizing strain of bacteria, Citrobacter sp., was isolated from effluent-treated plant soil at a textile and dyeing industrial site. The extracellular culture filtrate of this strain showed a broad-spectrum decolorization efficiency for azo and triphenylmethane dyes (12An S.Y. Min S.K. Cha I.H. Choi Y.L. Cho Y.S. Kim C.H. Lee Y.C. Biotechnol. Lett. 2002; 24: 1037-1040Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The enzyme that was responsible for the decolorization of triphenylmethane dyes was purified and biochemically characterized, and the gene encoding the enzyme was cloned (13Jang M.S. Lee Y.M.

Based on biochemical analysis, the enzyme, designated TMR, 3The abbreviations used are: TMR, triphenylmethane reductase; TEV, tobacco etch virus; rTEV, recombinant TEV protease; SeMet, selenomethionine; PAL, Pohang Accelerator Laboratory; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase. catalyzes the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of triphenylmethane dyes as a homodimer in solution, and has a substrate specificity that is dependent on the chemical structures of triphenylmethane dyes. The tmr gene encodes a 287-amino acid protein, and sequence analysis revealed the presence of a dinucleotide-binding motif (GXXGXXG) in the N terminus. Recently, using a transformation-based approach, a 60-kb plasmid, pGNB1, containing a triphenylmethane reductase gene and encoding a protein that is 99.7% identical to TMR, was isolated from a bacterial community in the activated sludge compartment of a wastewater treatment plant. Escherichia coli carrying pGNB1 showed a very similar dye-decolorization spectrum as TMR (14Schlüter A. Krahn I. Kollin F. Bönemann G. Stiens M. Szczepanowski R. Schneiker S. Pühler A. Appl.

Although efforts aimed at expanding the bioremediation of dye pollutants have made some progress, research into the development of bioremediation technologies have generally focused on the isolation and characterization of microorganisms able to decolorize synthetic dyes. Key information on the molecular mechanisms underlying the degradation of dye pollutants remains to be elucidated. In this study, we attempted to extend our knowledge of bioremediation using a structural approach. We crystallized TMR using the introduction of surface entropy reduction method, and solved the TMR structure at a resolution of 2.0 Å. We describe the three-dimensional structure of TMR in complex with the cofactor NADP+. Structural inspection of TMR reveals that, although it exhibits a typical SDR fold, the functional signatures of this family of proteins are not conserved. On the basis of the crystal structure and supporting mutagenesis data, we propose a catalytic mechanism for triphenylmethane dye-decolorization by TMR.

Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 7955-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) by PCR. The gene was subcloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of the expression vector pHis-Parallel1 (17Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), a hexahistidine (His6) fusion protein expression vector containing a recombinant TEV protease (rTEV) cleavage site, to generate the overexpression plasmid pHisP-TMR. Mutations were introduced into pHisP-TMR using QuikChange (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's protocol. E. coli Rosetta-gami (DE3) (Novagen) harboring the overexpression plasmid was grown in LB-ampicillin medium at 37 °C until the cultures reached an A600 between 0.6 and 0.8. The temperature was lowered to 25 °C, and protein expression was induced by treatment with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 14 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl), and the cell suspensions were ultrasonicated. The crude cell extracts were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysate containing His6-tagged protein was loaded onto a 10 ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) column that was pre-equilibrated with buffer A at 4 °C. The resin was washed with buffer A, and bound protein was eluted with buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole. The His6 tag was then released from the protein by incubation with rTEV (Amersham Biosciences), followed by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose and size exclusion chromatography. After purification, the recombinant protein contained a seven-residue cloning artifact (GAMDPEF) in its N terminus. The homogeneity of the protein was assessed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Purified protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, concentrated to 15 mg/ml using a YM-10 membrane (Amicon), and stored at -80 °C until use. Enzyme assays and kinetic analysis were performed with purified His6-tagged protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Gel-filtration analysis was carried out on a Superdex-75 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was calibrated using the following molecular mass standards: ribonuclease (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa). Crystallization—A Leu-21 to methionine (L21M)/L235M double mutation was introduced into TMR to facilitate selenomethionine (SeMet) incorporation, because there are no naturally occurring methionines in the protein other than the first and last residues. However, we were unable to successfully crystallize this mutant as an x-ray diffraction quality crystal, despite extensive efforts. Therefore, surface entropy reduction (18Cooper D.R. Boczek T. Grelewska K. Pinkowska M. Sikorska M. Zawadzki M. Derewenda Z. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was carried out to improve the crystal quality of the mutant protein. Lys-22 and Lys-23 were replaced with alanine, and the SeMet-labeled L21M/K22A/K23A/L235M mutant protein was expressed in the methionine auxotroph strain E. coli B834(DE3) (Novagen), which was grown in minimal medium supplemented with 50 mg/ml SeMet under the same conditions as the cells containing the native plasmid. The purification procedure for the SeMet-substituted protein was identical to that of the native protein, except for the addition of 5 mm methionine to all of the buffers. All of the crystallization trials were carried out using the sitting-drop technique at 21 °C. The initial trials were performed using the commercially available sparse-matrix screening kits Crystal Screen I and II from Hampton Research, and Wizard I and II from Emerald Biostructures. Initial crystals of native TMR were produced using 0.05 m KH2PO4 and 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, and x-ray diffraction-quality crystals appeared in the presence of 0.05 m KH2PO4 and 18% polyethylene glycol 8000 in 1 week. Striking results were obtained with the surface entropy reduced L21M/K22A/K23A/L235M mutant protein. The mutant yielded crystal hits under four different screening conditions during the initial screening stage (data not shown). The best crystals of the SeMet-substituted mutant were obtained using 0.28 m NaH2PO4/1.12 m K2HPO4, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.1 m imidazole, pH 8.0, in 1 day. Kinetic Analysis—The enzyme assay was performed as described previously by Jang et al. (13Jang M.S. Lee Y.M. Kim C.H. Lee J.H. Kang D.W. Kim S.J. Lee Y.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 7955-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Typical assay mixtures contained 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 μm basic fuchsin, 0.1 mm NADH, and a suitable amount of the enzyme in a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme at 30 °C and spectrophotometrically monitored at 544 nm. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce 1 μmol of basic fuchsin per minute using a molar absorption coefficient of 116,000 m-1 cm-1. Kinetic parameters for basic fuchsin were collected at a concentration range of 2 to 80 μm with a constant concentration of NADH (0.1 mm). The kinetic constants for NADPH were determined in the concentration range of 40 to 200 μm in the presence of a fixed concentration of basic fuchsin (40 μm) at 340 nm using a molar absorption coefficient of 6,220 m-1 cm-1. At least three independent determinations were performed for each kinetic constant. All of the kinetic results were analyzed using SigmaPlot Version 8.0 software (SPSS Inc.). Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—The structure of the L21M/K22A/K23A/L235M mutant was determined using the phases obtained from a single-wavelength anomalous diffraction experiment, with data collected at the selenium peak wavelength. Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data for the SeMet-substituted mutant was collected at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) beam line 6C at 2.5-Å resolution at -173 °C using crystals that were frozen in a cryosolution consisting of 0.32 m NaH2PO4/1.28 M K2HPO4, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m imidazole, pH 8.0, and 35% glycerol. The data for native TMR was collected at beam line 4A at PAL at 2.0-Å resolution, using crystals that were frozen in a cryo-solution consisting of 0.05 m KH2PO4, 25% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 10% glycerol. All of the x-ray diffraction data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 software package (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The SeMet-mutant crystal belongs to the space group P212121. There are four molecules in the asymmetric unit with a packing density of 3.17 Å3/Da, corresponding to an estimated solvent content of 61%. Anomalous differences from the selenium peak data set were used to locate the 12 selenium atoms using the program SOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystllogr. D Biol. Crtstallogr. 1997; 53: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Density modification and subsequent automated model building were performed using the program RESOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystllogr. D Biol. Crtstallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The initial RESOLVE model was used as a guide to manually build the remainder of the protein into density-modified maps with the programs COOT (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystllogr. D Biol. Crtstallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and O (23Jones A.T. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The final cycles of refinement included translation-liberation-screw refinement of the isotropic displacement parameters performed with REFMAC5 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The cycles of manual rebuilding and refinement resulted in Rfree and Rcryst factors of 23.9% and 19.0%, respectively. The model contains 1140 amino acid residues, including a cloning artifact (phenylalanine) at the N terminus of the molecule, and 242 water molecules. There are two missing amino acids (Lys-286 and Met-287) in the C terminus of each chain. The native TMR crystal belongs to the space group C2221. There is a single molecule in the asymmetric unit with a packing density of 2.51 Å3/Da, corresponding to an estimated solvent content of 51%. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the refined model of the SeMet crystal with the program MOLREP (25Vagin A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar). The refinement included the translation-liberation-screw procedure. Refinement resulted in Rfree and Rcryst values of 24.2% and 20.0%, respectively. No density was visible for the seven-residue cloning artifact at the N terminus and two amino acid residues at the C terminus. The model contains 284 amino acid residues, a molecule of NADP+, and 136 water molecules. Both native and SeMet TMR models satisfied the quality criteria limits of the program PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The crystallographic data statistics are summarized in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab Molecular Modeling of the Ternary Protein/Cofactor/Substrate Complex—Molecular docking of the substrate malachite green was performed using the structure of the TMR/NADP+ complex. Malachite green was automatically docked into the putative active site of the TMR/NADP+ complex by the program DS Flexible Docking in Discovery Studio, and the docked model was energy-minimized using the program CDOCKER in Discovery Studio 2.0 (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA). The active site was defined with a 6-Å radius sphere from the putative catalytic site of TMR. Overall Structure of TMR—Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of TMR using a publicly available program failed to reveal any structure-related functional information. Consequently, we generated crystals of a SeMet-incorporated variant of TMR (L21M/K22A/K23A/L235M) and used these crystals to solve the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Similarly, the structure of native TMR was determined, using the structure of SeMet-TMR as a model. The overall TMR structure consists of two domains. The large N-terminal domain is comprised of a Rossmann fold with a central core of parallel β-sheets (β1-β6 and β8) flanked by seven α helices (α1-α5, α7, and α11) and two 310 helices on both sides. The Rossmann fold generates an NAD(P)H-binding domain with a dinucleotide-binding motif (7GXXGXXG13). Typically, the Rossmann fold is composed of three parallel β strands linked by two α helices in the topological order βαβαβ, and binds one nucleotide. Thus, the binding domain for dinucleotides such as NAD(P)H consists of two paired Rossmann folds that each bind one nucleotide moiety of the cofactor molecule. The cofactor-binding domain of TMR has three additional α-helices (α3, α7, and α11) and a β-strand (β8) that disrupt the symmetry of the Rossman folds. The small C-terminal domain contains a parallel β-sheet (β7 and β9), five α helices (α6, α8-α10, and α12) and a 310 helix. This domain is assumed to function in substrate binding. The α10 and 310 helices, together with the last α helix (α5) of the Rossman fold domain form a hydrophobic pocket that is immediately adjacent to the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor (Figs. 1a, 3a, and 3c, also see below).FIGURE 3Model of the ternary TMR/NADP+/malachite green complex structure.a, the substrate malachite green was docked into the putative substrate binding site of the TMR·NADP+ complex structure (PDB code 2VRB).

Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) revealed that TMR is structurally related to the SDR fold family of proteins (29Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jörnvall H.

This structural similarity would not have been readily inferred from sequence data alone, because the pairwise sequence identities of these proteins with TMR are very low (<19%). Key topological features in all of these proteins, however, are conserved, although the secondary structure content in the small C-terminal domain varies among the proteins (Fig. 1b). These differences in the C-terminal regions might lead to different substrate specificities, indicating that the SDR family is a functionally heterogeneous family of proteins. The most closely related structure to TMR appeared to be the NADP+-binding restructured HSCARG protein, with a root mean square deviation of 2.6 Å for 268 equivalent residues. Quaternary Structure of TMR—Most of the SDR enzymes are dimers or tetramers in their active conformation (35Joernvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Although size exclusion chromatography revealed that native TMR behaves as a dimer in solution (data not shown), the crystal structure of native TMR has a single molecule in the asymmetric unit with the dimensions 58.8 × 141.7 × 37.8 Å. The crystal packing, however, reveals how the molecule generates a dimer contact with one other protein monomer. In addition, SeMet-TMR (L21M/K22A/K23A/L235M) contains four molecules in the asymmetric unit, which are arranged as a dimer of homodimers. A dimer with a 2-fold pseudosymmetry axis binds to another dimer with a second 2-fold pseudosymmetric axis perpendicular to the first axis. The long helices α4 and α5 (residues 79-97 and 116-132) in the large domain of each monomer pack against one another to form an antiparallel four-helix bundle at the subunit interface (Fig. 1c). Hydrophobic interactions by nonpolar residues are prominent at the interface, and a few hydrogen bonds also appear to play a major role in dimer stability. Residues involved in hydrophobic interactions at the interface are Thr-81, Leu-82, Ile-84, Val-85, Ala-88, Lys-92, His-119, Leu-122, Ala-123, Ala-127, and Thr-130. Hydrogen bonding side chains at the interface include Asp-79, Thr-81, Arg-95, and Thr-130. Asp-79 and Arg-95 also form salt bridges with each other. This dimer arrangement is consistent with the results of PISA (36Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6929) Google Scholar). The monomer surface area buried in the dimer interface is as large as 917 Å2, whereas the next largest interface buries only 555 Å2 of surface area. This interface has the highest possible PISA complexation significance score (CSS = 0.76), compared with a CSS of 0 for all other possible interfaces. These results suggested that the dimer structure arranged by the antiparallel four-helix bundle represents the active conformation of TMR (Fig. 1d). Cofactor Binding to TMR—Although no additional cofactor was added during expression, purification, or crystallization, early in the refinement of native TMR, it became evident that the protein contained a molecule of NADP(H). The cofactor groups were well defined by their electron density, with the exception of the nicotinamide moiety, which appeared to have a somewhat poorly defined electron density, particularly at positions C2, C4, and C5, in comparison to the rest of the cofactors (Fig. 2a). The cofactor appeared to be in the oxidized form according to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis (see supplemental data). We co-crystallized native TMR with 10 mm NADP+ under the same crystallization conditions as native TMR to improve the quality of the electron density map of the cofactor. Under these conditions, the crystal diffracted to a 1.96-Å resolution, and the refined model is essentially the same as that of native TMR. The phenylalanine cloning artifact in the N terminus and two amino acid residues (Lys-286 and Met-287) in the C terminus are included in the model. There are also five glycerols in the model. The overall quality of the electron density of the cofactor was improved, but the nicotinamide ring was still poorly defined (Fig. 2b). These results suggest that there is flexibility at the C4 position in the catalytic cycle. The crystallographic data statistics for the model (PDB code 2JL1) are summarized in Table 1.

https://openalex.org/W2021579813,"Defects in frataxin result in Friedreich ataxia, a genetic disease characterized by early onset of neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes. Frataxin is a conserved mitochondrial protein that controls iron needed for iron-sulfur cluster assembly and heme synthesis and also detoxifies excess iron. Studies in vitro have shown that either monomeric or oligomeric frataxin delivers iron to other proteins, whereas ferritin-like frataxin particles convert redox-active iron to an inert mineral. We have investigated how these different forms of frataxin are regulated in vivo. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, only monomeric yeast frataxin (Yfh1) was detected in unstressed cells when mitochondrial iron uptake was maintained at a steady, low nanomolar level. Increments in mitochondrial iron uptake induced stepwise assembly of Yfh1 species ranging from trimer to >24-mer, independent of interactions between Yfh1 and its major iron-binding partners, Isu1/Nfs1 or aconitase. The rate-limiting step in Yfh1 assembly was a structural transition that preceded conversion of monomer to trimer. This step was induced, independently or synergistically, by mitochondrial iron increments, overexpression of wild type Yfh1 monomer, mutations that stabilize Yfh1 trimer, or heat stress. Faster assembly kinetics correlated with reduced oxidative damage and higher levels of aconitase activity, respiratory capacity, and cell survival. However, deregulation of Yfh1 assembly resulted in Yfh1 aggregation, aconitase sequestration, and mitochondrial DNA depletion. The data suggest that Yfh1 assembly responds to dynamic changes in mitochondrial iron uptake or stress exposure in a highly controlled fashion and that this may enable frataxin to simultaneously promote respiratory function and stress tolerance.

The crystal structure of yeast frataxin trimer has suggested that this form of the protein may be able to perform both iron delivery and iron detoxification (9Karlberg T. Schagerlof U. Gakh O.

Electron microscopy reconstructions of a 24-subunit oligomer of yeast frataxin have further revealed that trimer is the building block of larger frataxin oligomers, which have a hollow cavity where an iron core can be progressively accumulated (10Schagerlöf U. Elmlund H. Gakh O. Nordlund G. Hebert H. Lindahl M. Isaya G. Al-Karadaghi S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4948-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). There are striking similarities in the structural organization of frataxin oligomers and ferritin, consistent with functional similarities between these two iron-storage proteins (2Park S. Gakh O.

Accordingly, expression of mitochondrial ferritin can rescue the phenotype of frataxin-depleted yeast and human cells (11Campanella A. Isaya G. O'Neill H. Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Arosio P. Levi S.

The ability to bind Fe2+ and deliver it to such proteins as the ISC scaffold IscU/Isu1, aconitase, and ferrochelatase can account for the roles played by frataxin in ISC enzyme biogenesis (13Muhlenhoff U.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 8-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Similarly, frataxin appears to use self-assembly to deliver iron to other proteins or detoxify excess iron. However, little is still known about this process. Assembly of the yeast frataxin homologue (Yfh1) in vitro requires the presence of Fe2+ and proceeds in an iron concentration-dependent manner, according to the progression α → α3 → α6 → α12 → α24 → α48 (36Adamec J.

Andrew A. Craig E.A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we later showed that mutations affecting Yfh1 assembly are asymptomatic in unstressed cells but become harmful during stress exposure and cause synthetic lethality in cells lacking copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (34Gakh O. Park S. Liu G. Macomber L. Imlay J.A. Ferreira G.C. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Iron-dependent assembly has also been characterized for the Escherichia coli orthologue, CyaY, and shown to be required for interaction of CyaY with the ISC assembly proteins IscU and IscS in vitro (8Layer G.

Laue T.M. Chasteen N.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Unlike the yeast or E. coli orthologues, human frataxin assembles at physiological iron concentrations during expression in E. coli or in human heart but not in vitro (40O'Neill H.A. Gakh O. Isaya G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Adinolfi S. Trifuoggi M. Politou A.S. Martin S. Pastore A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), indicating that different mechanisms govern frataxin assembly in different species. In the monocellular eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, frataxin most likely carries out iron delivery and detoxification concurrently, and indeed these functions are interdependent and difficult to separate (34Gakh O.

We therefore used S. cerevisiae as a model to begin to elucidate regulation of frataxin assembly in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESS. cerevisiae Expression Constructs and Strains—The mutant yfh1-Y73A and yfh1-T118A/V120A alleles were created by PCR, cloned into low copy plasmid YCplac22-YFH1 (34Gakh O.

Genet. 2006; 15: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) under the control of the natural YFH1 promoter, and sequenced completely. The YFH1, yfh1-Y73A, and yfh1-T118A/V120A alleles were also cloned in the EcoRI-SalI sites of a TRP1-based pRS404 integration vector under the control of the strong glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) promoter (43Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar) yielding plasmids pRSGPD-YFH1, pRSGPD-YFH1[Y73A], and pRSGPD-YFH1[T118A/V120A]. Strain yfh1Δ[YFH1][ρ+] (MATα ura3-52 lys2–801amber ade2-101ochre trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 yfh1Δ::HIS3 + YCp50-YFH1-URA3 [ρ+]) is a fully complemented derivative of strain yfh1Δ (34Gakh O. Park S. Liu G. Macomber L. Imlay J.A. Ferreira G.C. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Strains wild type (WT), Y73A, and T118A/V120A were obtained by transformation of strain yfh1Δ[YFH1][ρ+] with vectors YCplac22-YFH1, YCplac22-YFH1[Y73A], or YCplac22-YFH1[T118A/V120A], whereas strains WT*, Y73A*, and T118A/V120A* were obtained by transformation of strain yfh1Δ[YFH1][ρ+] with vectors pRSGPD-YFH1, pRSGPD-YFH1[Y73A], or pRSGPD-YFH1[T118A/V120A], followed by counter selection with 5′-fluoroorotic acid to eliminate the YCp50-YFH1-URA3 plasmid (34Gakh O.

Genet. 2006; 15: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).Mitochondria Isolation and Fractionation Procedures—The cells were preconditioned at 30 °C in 50 ml of YPGal medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose, 0.5% glucose) or 160 ml of SD medium (6.7% bacto-yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, supplemented with amino acids and other growth requirements) for ∼12 h. These cultures were used to inoculate larger cultures (500 ml at an A600 = 0.4 for YPGal cultures, and 1,500 ml at an A600 = 0.1 for SD cultures), and the incubation was continued at 30 °C. After 5 h of growth, iron (100 or 500 μm from a 100 mm FeCl3 stock solution) was added, and growth continued at 30 or 37 °C as required. Aerobic conditions were maintained by using a culture volume ≤⅕ of the volume of the culturing flask and by shaking the culture at 225 rpm (34Gakh O. Park S. Liu G. Macomber L. Imlay J.A. Ferreira G.C. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, washed with 500 ml of ice-cold water, and resuspended in 16 ml of MST buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 1 tablet/50 ml of complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and aliquoted into two 50-ml tubes. About 4 ml of 425–600 μm acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) were added to each tube, and the cells were lysed by vortexing three times for 2 min with 2-min intervals on ice. All of the subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Glass beads and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min, and mitochondria were isolated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in 800 μl of HN100 buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, with protease inhibitors) and immediately frozen in dry ice/ethanol. For size exclusion chromatography, each mitochondrial preparation was thawed on ice and immediately sonicated on ice, six times for 10 s with a Branson Sonifier 250 (with output control set at 5 and duty cycle at 50%), with a 1-min interval after each 10-s period. This step was immediately followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (typically 250 μl at a protein concentration of ∼20 mg/ml for YPGal cultures or ∼5 mg/ml for SD cultures) immediately loaded on a 10 mm × 30 cm column packed with Superdex 75 support (GE Healthcare). Fractions (0.5 ml) from the column were collected, and aliquots (20 and 35 μl from YPGal and SD cultures, respectively) were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and Western blotting. In some experiments, the mitochondria were disrupted by sonication as described above and diluted in HN100 buffer to a protein concentration of 4.5 mg/ml. The samples of these disrupted mitochondria were treated with 100 mm sodium carbonate, 1% dodecyl maltoside, or 1% Triton X-100 in HN100 buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Each sample was subsequently centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was carefully transferred to a new tube, and the sediment was resuspended in an equal volume of Laemmli buffer. The sediment was further heated at 100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged for 1 min at 20,800 × g. Equal volumes of the total, supernatant, and sediment samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For blue native PAGE, the samples of disrupted mitochondria were incubated in HN100 buffer in the presence of 1% dodecyl maltoside for designated times. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was analyzed by blue native PAGE on 3–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's protocol and subsequently detected by Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-Yfh1 antibody. In other experiments, the samples of disrupted mitochondria were incubated in the presence of 0.01–0.1% SDS and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were analyzed by native PAGE (3–12% Bis-Tris) followed by Western blotting or Prussian blue staining. Polyclonal antisera against recombinant purified forms of Yfh1, Nfs1, and Isu1 were generated in rabbits; anti-Aco1 polyclonal antiserum was a generous gift of A. L. Bulteau (Université Paris, Paris, France).Aconitase Activity, Protein Carbonylation, and Mitochondrial Iron Content—Mitochondria were suspended in MST buffer at a protein concentration of 25 mg/ml. Aliquots of these samples were frozen immediately, whereas additional aliquots were first subject to a 15-min aerobic incubation or a 5-min treatment with 100 μm H2O2 (from a 8.8 m solution) (Sigma) at room temperature and immediately frozen. These samples were subsequently used for (i) detection of protein carbonyls (100 μg and total protein) using an OxiBlot kit (Chemicon) per manufacturer's protocol; (ii) in-gel aconitase activity assays (150 μg of total protein) (44Tong W.H. Rouault T.A. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar); and (iii) measurement of mitochondrial iron content (10–600 μg of total protein, depending on growth conditions) (45Molik S. Lill R. Muhlenhoff U. Methods Cell Biol. 2007; 80: 261-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the BCA kit (Pierce).Measurements of Petite Formation and Cell Viability—All of the experiments were started with freshly streaked frozen stocks grown on YPD plates (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% dextrose) for 5 days (34Gakh O. Park S. Liu G. Macomber L. Imlay J.A. Ferreira G.C. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The incubations were carried out aerobically as described above. The cultures were initially synchronized to late logarithmic phase (A600 =∼1) in SD medium at 30 °C and diluted in fresh SD to A600 = 0.1. The cultures were allowed to reach A600 = 0.3 (∼5 h), at which point 100 μm FeCl3 or 500 μm H2O2 was added, and incubation continued at 37 °C. After plating on YPD and YPG (like YPD but with 2% glycerol instead of dextrose), the cells were scored for viability or respiratory capacity (33Karthikeyan G. Santos J.H. Graziewicz M.A. Copeland W.C. Isaya G. van Houten B. Resnick M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3331-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).RESULTSMutations That Enhance Yfh1 Oligomerization Hinder Yfh1 Precursor Maturation—A previous study identified amino acid substitutions (Y73A, H74A, D78A, V108A/T110A, and T118A/V120A) that enabled the Yfh1 monomer to form stable trimer at physiological iron concentrations during expression in E. coli (9Karlberg T. Schagerlof U. Gakh O. Park S. Ryde U. Lindahl M. Leath K. Garman E. Isaya G. Al-Karadaghi S. Structure. 2006; 14: 1535-1546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In an attempt to genetically manipulate the oligomeric state of frataxin in yeast, we expressed two Yfh1 proteins with stabilizing mutations, Yfh1-Y73A and Yfh1-T118A/V120A, in a yeast frataxin knock out strain (yfh1Δ). Frataxin is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a precursor polypeptide that is imported by mitochondria and processed to mature form by mitochondrial processing peptidase (46Branda S.S. Cavadini P. Adamec J. Kalousek F. Taroni F. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22763-22769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The precursor forms of the Yfh1-Y73A and Yfh1-T118A/V120A proteins were initially expressed by use of a low copy plasmid and the natural YFH1 promoter to yield strains Y73A and T118A/V120A. The ∼20-kDa mature form of Yfh1 was nearly undetectable by Western blotting in these strains, whereas it was readily detected in an isogenic WT strain (not shown). Unlike the yfh1Δ strain, however, Y73A and T118A/V120A grew nearly as well as WT on solid rich medium supplemented with fermentable or nonfermentable carbon sources at 30 °C (Fig. 1B), indicating that despite being present at very low levels, the Yfh1-Y73A and Yfh1-T118A/V120A proteins were functional. Analyses with purified yeast mitochondrial processing peptidase or isolated yeast mitochondria showed that the precursor form of the Yfh1-Y73A protein was proteolytically cleaved with slower kinetics as compared with the wild type Yfh1 precursor (supplemental Fig. S1). However, the mature forms derived from the wild type and mutant precursors were equally stable over time in isolated mitochondria (supplemental Fig. S1). This suggested that improving processing kinetics might be sufficient to increase the steady-state levels of mature Yfh1-Y73A. We therefore expressed mutant and wild type Yfh1 precursors under the control of the strong GPD promoter (43Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). A yfh1Δ strain bearing one chromosomally integrated copy of the yfh1-Y73A allele (strain Y73A*) contained levels of mature Yfh1 comparable with those present in WT, whereas strains bearing one integrated copy of wild type YFH1 or the yfh1-T118A/V120A allele (strains WT* and T118A/V120A*) contained ∼ 5 and ∼2 times more mature Yfh1 protein than WT (Fig. 1, C–F). The WT*, Y73A*, and T118A/V120A* strains were indistinguishable from WT on solid rich medium supplemented with fermentable or nonfermentable carbon sources (Fig. 1B).Oligomerization of Yfh1 Can Be Genetically Manipulated in Vivo—To analyze the assembly state of Yfh1 in conditions of low mitochondrial iron uptake, the strains described above were grown in liquid rich medium supplemented with galactose (YPGal), a fermentable carbon source that does not repress mitochondrial biogenesis and allows yeast to use respiration (47Velagapudi V.R. Wittmann C. Lengauer T. Talwar P. Heinzle E. Process Biochem. 2006; 41: 2170-2179Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The YPGal medium prepared in our laboratory normally contains ∼12 μm iron, a concentration sufficient to partially repress the plasma membrane high affinity iron transport system and limit cellular iron influx (48Felice M.R. De Domenico I. Li L. Ward D.M. Bartok B. Musci G. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22181-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cultures were preconditioned in YPGal for 12 h, diluted into fresh YPGal, and harvested after ∼20 h, corresponding to the early exponential phase of growth. The mitochondria were isolated, and the total mitochondrial iron content was determined as a measure of mitochondrial iron uptake. Mitochondria consistently contained ∼3 nmol of iron/mg of protein (Table 1). To assess the assembly state of Yfh1, the soluble mitochondrial fraction (100,000 × g supernatant) was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography followed by Western blotting. Monomer was the only species detected in WT (Fig. 1C). Similarly, monomer was the predominant species detected in WT*, although lower levels of trimer and larger oligomers were also present in this strain (Fig. 1D). In contrast, trimer was the predominant form present in Y73A*, whereas monomer could not be detected (Fig. 1E).

https://openalex.org/W2005645394,"It has been demonstrated that c-Fos has, in addition to its well recognized AP-1 transcription factor activity, the capacity to associate to the endoplasmic reticulum and activate key enzymes involved in the synthesis of phospholipids required for membrane biogenesis during cell growth and neurite formation. Because membrane genesis requires the coordinated supply of all its integral membrane components, the question emerges as to whether c-Fos also activates the synthesis of glycolipids, another ubiquitous membrane component. We show that c-Fos activates the metabolic labeling of glycolipids in differentiating PC12 cells. Specifically, c-Fos activates the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (GlcCerS), the product of which, GlcCer, is the first glycosylated intermediate in the pathway of synthesis of glycolipids. By contrast, the activities of GlcCer galactosyltransferase 1 and lactosylceramide sialyltransferase 1 are essentially unaffected by c-Fos. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cells co-transfected with c-Fos and a V5-tagged version of GlcCerS evidenced that both proteins participate in a physical association. c-Fos expression is tightly regulated by specific environmental cues. This strict regulation assures that lipid metabolism activation will occur as a response to cell requirements thus pointing to c-Fos as an important regulator of key membrane metabolisms in membrane biogenesis-demanding processes."

Additionally, sequence analysis of the viral genome provides information about patterns of genetic divergence that may have occurred during viral evolution.In this study we have analyzed the subtypes of Human Immunodeficiency Virus -1 (HIV-1) circulating in a diverse sample population of Nairobi, Kenya.69 blood samples were collected from a diverse subject population attending the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Total DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and used in a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify the HIV gag gene. The PCR amplimers were partially sequenced, and alignment and phylogenetic analysis of these sequences was performed using the Los Alamos HIV Database.Blood samples from 69 HIV-1 infected subjects from varying ethnic backgrounds were analyzed. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed 39 isolates to be subtype A, 13 subtype D, 7 subtype C, 3 subtype AD and CRF01_AE, 2 subtype G and 1 subtype AC and 1 AG. Deeper phylogenetic analysis revealed HIV subtype A sequences to be highly divergent as compared to subtypes D and C.Our analysis indicates that HIV-1 subtypes in the Nairobi province of Kenya are dominated by a genetically diverse clade A. Additionally, the prevalence of highly divergent, complex subtypes, intersubtypes, and the recombinant forms indicates viral mixing in Kenyan population, possibly as a result of dual infections."
https://openalex.org/W1976091081,"The folding of many proteins depends on the assistance of chaperonins like GroEL and GroES and involves the enclosure of substrate proteins inside an internal cavity that is formed when GroES binds to GroEL in the presence of ATP.

Strikingly, assembly of the folding-active GroEL-GroES complex appears to involve a strategic delay in ATP hydrolysis that is coupled to disassembly of the old, ADP-bound GroEL-GroES complex on the opposite ring. To fold, many essential proteins require the assistance of specialized molecular chaperones known as chaperonins (1Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). The GroELS chaperonin system of Escherichia coli is one of the best-studied examples of the chaperonin class of molecular chaperones (for review see Refs. 2Lin Z. Rye H.S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

GroEL is a tetradecamer of fourteen identical 57-kDa subunits arranged into two heptameric rings (4Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Each ring contains a large, central, open cavity, and the two rings are stacked back-to-back to create a double toroid. Maximally efficient folding of most proteins that possess a strict dependence on GroEL (so-called stringent substrate proteins) requires that they be encapsulated within a closed chamber formed by a GroEL ring and the separate co-chaperonin GroES (5Rye H.S.

Binding of the GroES lid over a captured substrate protein seals the GroEL cavity and releases the non-native protein into the confined space of the GroEL-GroES chamber (the cis complex). Protein folding proceeds in this isolated space for several seconds until the GroEL-GroES complex is dismantled and the substrate protein, folded or not, is ejected into free solution (5Rye H.S.

Binding of ATP to a GroEL ring drives a large-scale rearrangement of the GroEL subunits, resulting in a dramatic elevation and rotation of the GroEL apical domains away from the central cavity (14Xu Z.

However, despite a wealth of structural and biophysical information, precisely how assembly of the GroEL-GroES cis complex leads to substrate protein encapsulation, release, and folding remains poorly understood. Because they bind to the same part of a GroEL ring, how does GroES binding lead to substrate protein encapsulation before the non-native protein escapes into solution? In addition, how is substrate protein release and folding coordinated with ATP hydrolysis? Large, stringent substrate proteins not only bind to sites on the GroEL apical domains that overlap with the binding sites for GroES but are also likely to fill and spill out of the open GroEL ring (14Xu Z.

This raises a serious issue: how does GroES locate and bind to its binding sites on a GroEL ring without the substrate protein prematurely escaping into solution? In fact, ATP must bind before GroES, and the same, highly cooperative structural rearrangements of the GroEL ring that lead to GroES binding also weaken the interaction between the substrate protein and the GroEL ring (13Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 23Badcoe I.G. Smith C.J. Wood S. Halsall D.J. Holbrook J.J. Lund P.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Based on a detailed examination of changes in Trp fluorescence of an engineered GroEL mutant, it has been suggested that GroES loading and substrate encapsulation could occur prior to substrate protein release (25Cliff M.J. Limpkin C. Cameron A. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21266-21275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this case, however, a small and non-stringent substrate protein was employed and conformational changes in the substrate during encapsulation could not be assessed. Other work has suggested that premature substrate release is prevented by a secondary timer within the assembled GroEL-GroES complex, implying that the initiation of ATP hydrolysis and substrate release is tightly coupled (26Ueno T. Taguchi H. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here we have examined these questions using a novel, chemically modified mutant of GroEL that has a small organic probe attached to an engineered Cys residue at the bottom of the GroEL cavity. Designated EL43Py, this modified GroEL variant displays a much higher rate of steady-state ATP hydrolysis than wild-type GroEL (wtGroEL) 3The abbreviations used are: wtGroEL, wild-type GroEL; Rubisco, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; AEDANS, 5-(2-acetoamidoethyl)aminonaphthalene 1-sulfonate. but is dramatically compromised in its ability to fold stringent GroEL substrate proteins. We demonstrate that EL43Py populates, but fails to efficiently exit, a key intermediate allosteric state of the GroEL ring. We show that the ATP-driven formation of this intermediate conformation of the GroEL ring is necessary not only for GroES binding, but also for the forced unfolding of the non-native substrate protein. Premature escape of a large, non-native substrate protein from the GroEL ring is inhibited through the formation of this intermediate allosteric state, which can simultaneously bind both substrate protein and GroES with high affinity. Additionally, even though population of this allosteric state is sufficient to commit the bound ATP to hydrolysis, ATP turnover is delayed during a normal GroEL folding cycle. This slowing in ATP hydrolysis is linked to the disassembly of the ADP-bound GroEL-GroES complex on the opposite ring and ensures that GroES binding and substrate encapsulation are complete prior to the initiation of ATP hydrolysis. Proteins—The GroEL variants containing single Cys residues S43C (EL43C), A529C (EL529C), A535C (EL535C), and E315C (EL315C) were created using standard site-directed mutagenesis techniques in the background of a cysteine-free version of GroEL (27Rye H.S.

All GroEL variants were expressed and purified using a combination of previously described methods (5, 27, 28; see also supplemental “Methods”). Wild-type GroES, GroES98C, wild-type Rubisco and the various Rubisco Cys mutants were expressed and purified as previously described (5Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B.

Hexokinase, creatine kinase, rabbit pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and protease K were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Labeling of GroEL and Rubisco with Fluorescent Dyes—Labeling of GroEL and Rubisco variants was performed as previously described (27Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R.

All dyes were obtained from Invitrogen and were prepared fresh from dry powder in anhydrous dimethylformamide immediately prior to use. Following separation from unreacted dye, EL43Py was further purified over a Sephacryl-300 column. The extent and specificity of dye conjugation was examined as previously described (29Lin Z. Rye H.S.

Unless otherwise stated, the extent of dye conjugation to specific Cys residues was between 95 and 100% for GroEL and Rubisco variants. The labeling efficiency of ES98F was ∼15% (∼1 dye/heptamer). Refolding and Enzymatic Assays—The refolding of Rubisco and rhodanese was assayed essentially as previously described (2Lin Z. Rye H.S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

The measurement of steady-state ATP hydrolysis was conducted using a coupled enzymatic assay (28Poso D. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. J. Mol.

The change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured at 25 °C using an Amersham Biosciences Pharmacia Ultrospec 3100 pro spectrophotometer. Pre-steady-state measurements of ATP hydrolysis were conducted with a rapid-mixing, quench-flow apparatus (KinTek, Austin, TX) using [γ-32P]ATP. Time points were quenched with 4 m formic acid, and samples were analyzed and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences Storm 860, Sunnyvale, CA) following TLC separation of free phosphate, ADP, and ATP (33Jeong Y.J.

Asymmetric GroEL-GroES Complex Formation and Protease Protection—The binding of Rubisco to the trans ring of a GroEL-GroES complex was conducted by first creating an asymmetric GroEL-ADP-GroES complex (see supplemental “Methods”). For protease protection experiments, the asymmetric GroEL-ADP-GroES complex was mixed (100 nm GroEL and 350 nm GroES, final) with acid-urea-denatured fluorescein-labeled Rubisco (Rub454F, 100 nm). The sample was then supplemented with either buffer or ATP (1 mm) and rapidly mixed (within ∼5 s) with hexokinase (0.05 unit/μl) and glucose (20 mm). Protease K (0.05 μg/ml) was added to each sample, aliquots at each time point were removed, and the protease was deactivated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mg/ml). Samples were then run on SDS-PAGE, and the level of undigested Rubisco was determined by quantifying the amount of intact and fluorescent Rubisco using a Storm 860 system. For the protease experiments shown in Fig. 3C, GroES binding was blocked at different times following the addition of ATP (1 mm) with excess SR1 (600 nm). In all cases, the ATP was depleted after 5 s with hexokinase and glucose. Samples were supplemented with proteinase K (0.9 μg/ml) for 2 min, and then separated and quantified. Gel Filtration—Analytical gel filtration of chaperonin complexes was conducted with a Superose 6 (GE Healthcare Systems) column connected to a high-performance liquid chromatograph (Waters, Milford, MA) configured with an in-line fluorescence detector. All component mixing was performed in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 10 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm dithiothreitol (Buffer A). For experiments examining the dissociation rate of GroES, the column running buffer was 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 200 μm ADP, 2 mm dithiothreitol. For both wtGroEL and EL43Py, excess unlabeled GroES (4 μm) was added to mixtures of each chaperonin containing fluorescently labeled GroES and ATP after 2 min of steady-state cycling. At various times, the ATP was rapidly quenched with hexokinase and glucose, and the samples were loaded onto the Superose gel-filtration column. The amount of free and chaperonin-bound fluorescent GroES was then measured. ADP Release—ADP bullets with radiolabeled ADP in the cis ring were made by mixing GroEL (7 μm), GroES (14 μm), and radiolabeled ATP (245 μm, and 20 μCi of [α-32P]ATP) in Buffer A. The mix was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C to form ADP bullets (see supplemental “Methods”). The ADP bullets were then diluted to 100 nm and mixed with denatured Rubisco (100 nm) and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min to allow non-native Rubisco binding to the trans ring. Cold ATP (1 mm) or buffer was then added, and at varying times the solution was applied to a Zeba micro spin desalting column (Pierce) and centrifuged at maximum speed (16 × 103 relative centrifugal force) in a table-top microcentrifuge for 4 s. The sample flow-through was analyzed with a scintillation counter (Wallac). Stopped-flow Fluorescence and Data Analysis—Stopped-flow experiments were performed essentially as previously described (29Lin Z. Rye H.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 23-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), using an SFM-400 rapid mixing unit (BioLogic, Claix, France) equipped with a custom designed, two-channel fluorescence detection system. The time-dependent change in donor-side FRET efficiency of the labeled Rubisco monomer was extracted from matched sets of donor-only and donor-acceptor stopped flow experiments as previously described (29Lin Z. Rye H.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 23-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fitting of experimental data were accomplished with either Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR) or Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). EL43Py Is a Fully Productive, but Slow, Protein-folding Machine—We recently carried out a targeted screen for amino acid positions at the base of the GroEL cavity that could be used to attach small fluorescent probes. We introduced a series of conservative Cys mutations into a cysteine-less GroEL background (27Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) at locations around the bottom of the GroEL cavity (Fig. 1A). Labeling one of these GroEL mutants (S43C) with the organic fluorophore N-1-pyrenemaleimide (Fig. 1B) serendipitously resulted in a GroEL variant (EL43Py) that demonstrated unexpected alterations in assisted protein folding. While EL43Py productively folds substrate proteins like Rubisco (Fig. 1C) and rhodanese (Fig. 1D), it does so much more slowly than wtGroEL. We reasoned that a modified chaperonin like EL43Py might represent a powerful new tool for studying the mechanism of GroEL-mediated protein folding, especially given the ongoing debate about the importance of the GroEL C-terminal tails, which are located in a similar region at the base of the GroEL cavity (35Machida K. Kono-Okada A. Hongo K. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6886-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl.

Cell. 2006; 125: 903-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To establish the utility of EL43Py, we therefore examined whether the folding deficiency of EL43Py can be explained by a trivial and inhibitory interaction between exogenous dyes localized at the bottom of the GroEL cavity and non-native folding intermediates. We employed two strategies for this analysis: 1) conjugation of different, modestly hydrophobic dyes to the same EL43C position and 2) development of additional GroEL variants with labeled Cys residues at nearby but distinct positions within the GroEL cavity. When we attached a range of chemically and physically dissimilar substituents to position 43, most showed little or no alteration in assisted protein folding (see supplemental “Methods”). For example, modification of the 43C position with the moderately hydrophobic dye AEDANS (Fig. 1B), results in a GroEL variant (EL43Ed) that displays no significant alteration in Rubisco folding (Fig. 1C). More importantly, conjugation of pyrene to unique Cys residues at positions 529 and 535 results in chaperonins (EL529Py and EL535Py) that, while possessing pyrene dye rings at the base of the GroEL cavity similar to EL43Py, show no significant perturbation in Rubisco folding (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1). EL43Ed and EL529Py do display a somewhat reduced capacity to refold rhodanese (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the presence of the dyes can have a modest influence on the folding of certain proteins. However, this effect is relatively small in comparison to the more dramatic effects observed with EL43Py. Overall, these observations strongly suggest that the perturbed folding behavior displayed by EL43Py is not primarily caused by inhibitory interactions between the pyrene dyes and a substrate protein. EL43Py Executes a Full Hydrolytic Reaction Cycle More Quickly Than GroEL—Because efficient protein folding by GroEL depends upon a carefully coordinated, ATP-driven reaction cycle (Fig. 2), we next examined how EL43Py binds and hydrolyzes ATP. Unexpectedly, EL43Py demonstrates a substantially elevated rate of steady-state ATP hydrolysis, both in the presence and absence of GroES (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S2). Another EL43C variant, in this case labeled with fluorescein (EL43Fl), also displays a clear linkage between reduced folding and enhanced ATP hydrolysis (supplemental Fig. S1). By contrast, labeled variants of EL43C that show little or no perturbation in facilitated protein folding show wild-type rates of steady-state ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S1). Thus the reduction in protein folding observed with EL43Py appears to be linked to a substantial increase in steady-state ATP hydrolysis. Interestingly, EL43Py displays an allosteric response to ATP that is very similar to that exhibited by wtGroEL (supplemental Fig. S3). At low ATP concentrations, where ATP binding occurs to only one ring of the tetradecamer complex (38Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 39Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 40Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), EL43Py displays a positive cooperative transition that is very similar to wtGroEL. EL43Py also displays changes in ATP hydrolysis at higher concentrations of ATP that are similar to wtGroEL (supplemental Fig. S3), whereas EL43Py displays a consistently higher steady-state rate of ATP turnover at high ATP concentrations. Overall, these observations suggest that ATP binding, and the attendant structural changes that lead to hydrolysis, are similar in EL43Py and wtGroEL, but that EL43Py completes a cycle of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2, Phase II) more quickly than wtGroEL. The elevated rate of steady-state ATP hydrolysis by EL43Py implies that the rate-limiting step of the EL43Py reaction cycle is different from that exhibited by wtGroEL (Fig. 2). To establish the nature of this difference, we first examined the intrinsic, single-turnover rate of ATP within the EL43Py-GroES cis complex. Using a rapid mixing, quench-flow apparatus, we directly measured the rate of ATP turnover for both the EL43Py-GroES and wtGroEL-GroES complex (Fig. 3B), employing only enough ATP to support one round of GroES binding and ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2, Phase I). Remarkably, the kcat values observed for the EL43Py and GroEL cis complexes are essentially identical (0.11-0.13 s-1 per active subunit) and are well matched to the values obtained from the steady-state hydrolysis data in supplemental Fig. S3, as well as measurements from other studies (5Rye H.S.

Thus, the increase in steady-state ATP turnover by EL43Py cannot be due to a stimulation of intrinsic ATP hydrolysis within the cis complex. We next examined the pre-steady-state ATP hydrolysis kinetics of EL43Py and wtGroEL, in the presence of GroES, and at levels of ATP sufficient to allow multiple rounds of GroES association and release (Fig. 3C). With wtGroEL, we observe a burst of ATP hydrolysis followed by a linear, steady-state reaction phase. The burst is a direct consequence of the rapid formation of a committed, GroEL-ATP-GroES cis complex (Fig. 2, Phase I), followed by the slow decay of the post-hydrolysis GroEL-ADP-GroES complex upon ATP binding to the trans ring and initiation of the steady-state cycle (Fig. 2, Phase II (9Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 27Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L.

Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The pre-steady-state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by EL43Py are distinct from wtGroEL. Although EL43Py also displays a burst of ATP hydrolysis that is followed by a linear steady-state reaction, the amplitude of the burst from EL43Py is smaller than that observed with wtGroEL while the linear phase is significantly faster (Fig. 3C). In the context of a simple two-step kinetic model that describes the pre-steady-state hydrolysis burst of GroEL (see supplemental “Methods”), these observations suggest that the rate-limiting transition that controls cis complex disassembly (Fig. 2, rate-limiting step) proceeds much more quickly with EL43Py than wtGroEL. This conclusion further predicts that EL43Py should release GroES more rapidly than wtGroEL in the course of a steady-state reaction cycle. We tested this prediction using an assay capable of tracking the dissociation rate of GroES during the course of a steady-state GroEL hydrolysis reaction (Fig. 3D). In strong support of our model, the rate of GroES release from EL43Py is 2.6-fold faster than that observed with wtGroEL, an increase that is very similar to the 2.3-fold increase in the steady-state hydrolysis rate of EL43Py in the presence of GroES. EL43Py Fully Supports Protein Capture and Encapsulation Beneath GroES—EL43Py thus displays two key characteristics: 1) a considerably faster hydrolytic cycle and 2) a substantially slower rate of assisted protein folding. The behavior of EL43Py could thus be interpreted as satisfying a key prediction of one model of GroEL action, in which the primary stimulatory action provided by GroEL derives from substrate protein confinement within the GroEL-GroES cavity. A faster reaction cycle in this model should result in a reduced cis-cavity lifetime and therefore slower folding. The strength of this conclusion, however, rests upon whether EL43Py: 1) captures non-native substrate protein, 2) encapsulates the substrate protein beneath GroES, and 3) releases the substrate protein into the GroEL-GroES cavity as efficiently as wtGroEL. We therefore examined whether EL43Py correctly binds non-native substrate protein. Because the open trans ring of a GroEL-ADP-G"

However, the molecular mechanism underlying ischemic cell death is not well defined. To examine the function of apoptosis repressor with a caspase recruitment domain (ARC) in the ischemic/hypoxic damage of cardiomyocytes, we generated cardio-specific ARC transgenic mice using a mouse α-myosin heavy chain promoter. Compared with the control, the hearts of ARC transgenic mice showed a 3-fold overexpression of ARC. Langendoff preparation showed that the hearts isolated from ARC transgenic mice exhibited improved recovery of contractile performance during reperfusion. The cardiomyocytes cultured from neonatal ARC transgenic mice were significantly resistant to hypoxic cell death. Furthermore, the ARC C-terminal calcium-binding domain was as potent to protect cardiomyocytes from hypoxic cell death as ARC. Genome-wide RNA expression profiling uncovered a list of genes whose expression was changed (>2-fold) in ARC transgenic mice. Among them, expressional regulation of developmentally regulated RNA-binding protein 1 (Drbp1) or the dimethylglycine dehydrogenase precursor (pMe2GlyDH) affected hypoxic death of cardiomyocytes.

Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is an evolutionarily conserved process that plays a critical role in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. In humans and mice, dysregulated apoptosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer and in autoimmune, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). Recently, apoptosis of cardiomyocytes has been recognized as a cellular mechanism of ischemic injury in the heart. Furthermore, a large body of research has focused on identifying the signaling molecules that might protect the myocardium from ischemic damage (2Bishopric N.H. Andreka P. Slepak T. Webster K.A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For example, signaling molecules enhance apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, such as p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, tumor necrosis factor-α, p53, β-adrenergic receptors, and nitric oxide (2Bishopric N.H.

In contrast, other signaling pathways have been demonstrated to protect the heart from apoptosis, such as cardiotrophin-1 through the gp130 receptor, p38β, insulin-like growth factor-1, Akt/protein kinase B, protein kinase C, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (2Bishopric N.H.

Thus, an increased understanding of the signaling pathways that are regulated during ischemia/reperfusion is important for the development of effective therapies (10Hamacher-Brady A. Brady N.R.

(apoptosis repressor with CARD) is a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) protein that is expressed almost exclusively in long-lived tissues, such as heart, skeletal muscles, and brain. ARC selectively interacts with the initiator caspases-2 and -8, and significantly attenuates death receptor-induced apoptosis dependent on the activation of these caspases (11Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In the H9c2 cell line, ectopic expression of ARC suppressed apoptosis, the protection being mediated, in total or in part, through the blockade of hypoxia-induced cytochrome c released from the mitochondria (12Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius 3rd, F.C. Nunez G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: e70-e77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, specific interference with both receptor and mitochondria death pathways, as well as its high cardiac expression, makes ARC a unique and central cardiac death repressor. This supposition is supported by the observation that viral gene transfer or TAT-mediated transduction of ARC reduces infarct size after the ischemia/reperfusion injury of isolated rat hearts and blocks the development of post-ischemic cardiomyopathy (13Chatterjee S. Bish L.T. Jayasankar V. Stewart A.S. Woo Y.J. Crow M.T. Gardner T.J. Sweeney H.L. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc.

Willenbockel C. Al-Saadi N. Gross V. Willnow T. Bader M. Martin U. Bauersachs J. Wollert K.C. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Circulation. 2006; 113: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the detailed function of ARC as a suppressor of ischemic damage in the heart needs to be clarified. In this study, by generating cardio-specific ARC transgenic (Tg) mice and global gene expression analysis, we found that ARC protects cardiomyocytes from ischemic/hypoxic damages via its C-terminal Pro/Glu-rich region and expressional regulation of Drbp1 and pMe2GlyDH. Plasmid Construction and shRNA Analysis—The mouse ARC cDNA was subcloned into an expression vector under the control of a cardio-specific mouse α-myosin heavy chain (αMHC) promoter (16Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARC, NARC-(1–98), and CARC-(99–208) were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and pEGFP (Clontech) (17Jo D.G. Lee J.Y. Hong Y.M. Song S. Mook-Jung I. Koh J.Y. Jung Y.K. J.

Generation of ARC Tg Mice—The mouse ARC expression construct was injected into embryos and positive F0 mice were identified by PCR analysis using a synthetic oligonucleotide (forward, 5′-CCACA TTCTT CAGGA TTCTC-3′) corresponding to the MHC promoter and a oligonucleotide (reverse, 5′-CTTCT GGCGT CCAGT GG-3′) of ARC cDNA (Macrogen Inc., Korea). Three independent founder lines were identified and mated to FVB wild type (WT) mice to generate a pure FVB genetic background WT for the F2 generation, and then F3 Tg offspring were then backcrossed to Balb/c 3T3 mice under a 12:12 h light:dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum. The animal protocols were approved by the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology and Seoul National University Standing Committees on Animals. Genomic DNA PCR and Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)—Genomic DNA PCR from the tails of Tg mice and RT-PCR from the whole tissues of Tg mice were carried out as described previously (18Tian R.

Western Blot Analysis—Samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO3, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and the amounts of protein were determined using the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Total 30–50 μg of cell extracts in a buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the Semi-Dry Transfer system (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Proteins were then visualized using Enhanced Chemiluminescence. Anti-ARC antibody was purified by ARC affinity chromatography. Mouse anti-FADD and anti-poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase antibody were purchased from Pharmingen. Histological Analysis and Immunohistochemistry—After perfusion, the hearts were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, embedded, and thin-sectioned, followed by deparaffinization and rehydration. The paraffin sections were blocked in 5% rabbit serum and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-ARC antibody. For the preparation of frozen sections, hearts were isolated after perfusion and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled OCT embedding medium (Tissue-Tek). The frozen sections were cut to a 5-μm thickness and mounted on silane-coated slides. Langendoff Preparation of Isolated Mouse Hearts—The mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) and their hearts were excised and perfused with oxygenated buffer (21Yet S.F.

The hearts were retrogradely perfused on a Langendoff apparatus with Krebs-Henseleit solution (118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES) with a gas mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Through a left atrial incision, a latex balloon connected to a pressure transducer was inserted into the left ventricular (LV) cavity for the measurement of the LV isovolumic pressure. The LVEDp was identified as the lowest value from the LV pressure curve. The LVDp and heart rate were continuously monitored using a polygraph and a computer analysis system (PolyView, GRASS Co.). Induction of Myocardial Infarction—After 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion, the left anterior descending coronary artery was reoccluded, and 1 ml of 1.0% Evans blue was injected into the apex of each heart to stain nonischemic tissue. The hearts were then excised, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, embedded in agarose, and cut into five transverse slices for 15 min of incubation at room temperature with 1.5% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride to measure viable myocardium (red staining). Slices were photographed (each side) under a microscope and the left ventricular area, the area at risk, and the infarct area were determined by digital planimetry (14Gustafsson A.B. Sayen M.R. Williams S.D. Crow M.T. Gottlieb R.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). TUNEL Assay—Accumulated internucleosomal DNA fragments (apoptosis) were detected using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Percentages of positively stained cells were determined by counting the numbers of labeled cells and total cells in cross-sections (15Donath S. Li P. Willenbockel C. Al-Saadi N. Gross V. Willnow T.

Isolation of Neonatal Cardiomyocytes and DNA Transfection—ARC homozygous Tg mice for this study were produced by mating heterozygous ARC Tg mice in the Balb/c 3T3 background to heterozygous ARC Tg mice and used for primary culture. A procedure for culturing ventricular cardiomyocytes from neonatal mice was modified (23Nakamura T.Y. Goda K. Okamoto T. Nakamura T. Goshima K. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 758-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For transfection, cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal ARC Tg mice were allowed to stabilize for 3 days and then transfected with plasmids using PolyFectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen). In Vitro Hypoxia of Cultured Cardiomyocytes and Cell Death Assays—Cardiomyocytes were cultured in fetal bovine serum/minimal essential medium. Hypoxia was simulated by incubating cells in a hypoxic buffer (125 mm NaCl, 8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 6.25 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm 2-deoxyglucose, 5 mm sodium lactate, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.6) and by placing the cells under hypoxic pouches (GasPak™ EZ, BD Biosciences) at 37 °C (10Hamacher-Brady A.

Cell death assays were performed using the Live/Dead cell viability kit (Molecular Probes). Microarray Using GenePix 4000B Gene Expression Profiling— Total RNA samples were prepared from the hearts of 3- and 30-week-old mice by using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA samples (30 μg) were labeled with cyanine (Cy3) or cyanine (Cy5)-conjugated dCTP (Amersham) by a reverse transcription reaction using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). The labeled cDNA mixture was resuspended and mixed in 10 μl of hybridization solution (GenoCheck, Korea) and placed on an OpArray mouse genome 35K (OPMMV4, Operon Biotechnologies, GmbH). The hybridized slides were washed in a buffer (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 min, 1× SSC for 3 min, and then 0.2× SSC for 2 min) at room temperature. Microarray Data Analysis—Microarray data analysis was carried out as described previously (24Irizarry R.A. Warren D. Spencer F. Kim I.F. Biswal S. Frank B.C. Gabrielson E. Garcia J.G. Geoghegan J.

Statistical Analyses—All statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by SigmaStat software. Generation of Tg Mice Overexpressing ARC in the Heart—To examine the molecular function of ARC in the hypoxic injury of heart, we generated cardio-specific Tg mice overexpressing mouse ARC using the promoter of mouse MHC gene (Fig. 1). ARC Tg mice were born normal and grew to adulthood without any abnormalities in their health and appearance. Compared with WT, an analysis of tissue extracts using Western blotting (Fig. 1A) and polymerase chain reaction (Fig. 1B) demonstrated an increased level of ARC protein and RNA with about 3-fold in the whole heart tissues of ARC Tg mice, but not in the kidney as well as in liver and brain. 4J.-O.

In ARC Tg mice, strong immunoreactivity against ARC was restricted to ∼40% of individual cardiomyocytes, which is consistent with the previous report demonstrating the expression pattern of heme oxygenase-1 under the control of MHC promoter (21Yet S.F. Tian R. Layne M.D. Wang Z.Y. Maemura K. Solovyeva M. Ith B. Melo L.G. Zhang L. Ingwall J.S. Dzau V.J. Lee M.E. Perrella M.A. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Although histological examination with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining revealed no severe cardiac morphological defects, cardiac remodeling was evident in the hearts of ARC Tg mice with the relative increase in cell numbers (Fig. 1D). Comparison of heart sizes revealed that under resting conditions, the hearts of ARC Tg mice were apparently larger than those of age-matched WT mice (Fig. 1F). There was a 20% difference in the ratios of heart/body weights between 8-week-old ARC Tg and WT mice, whereas no detectible difference was observed with respect to kidney weight (Fig. 1E). In addition, examination of the expression of hypertrophic markers, such as atrial natriuretic factor and β-MHC, and MMP2, the sign of fibrosis, with RT-PCR analysis revealed no obvious increase in the hearts of ARC Tg mice (Fig. 1G). These findings suggest that heart enlargement observed in ARC Tg mice may result from the principal cause of the increased cell numbers. Hemodynamic Function of the Isolated Hearts of ARC Tg Mice—Under normal living conditions, ARC Tg mice displayed no apparent failure of the heart after a 12-month follow-up. To investigate the cardiac function of ARC, the hemodynamic parameters were recorded for 50 min of reperfusion after global ischemia. The baseline heart rates were similar between two groups, WT and ARC Tg mice.4 Compared with WT mice, however, the left ventricular development pressure (LVDp) and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDp) were significantly improved in the hearts of ARC Tg mice (Fig. 2, A and B). These findings indicate that ARC functions to suppress ischemia/reperfusion-induced deterioration of the Langendoff preparation exhibiting cardiac dysfunction and overt heart failure. We then assessed the myocardial infarct after occluding left anterior descending coronary artery followed by reperfusion for 24 h. Total left ventricular area, the area at risk, and the infarct area were measured. Large infarcts were observed in the hearts of WT mice (Fig. 2C). Infarct size (infarct/risk area) was significantly reduced in Tg mice compared with WT mice (about 40%).4 This was accompanied by a significant decrease in apoptosis as measured with proteolytic cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase, a hallmark of apoptosis (Fig. 2D). Similarly, an evaluation of death rates using the TUNEL assay revealed reduced cell death (5.2-fold decrease) in the hearts of ARC Tg mice compared with WT mice during ischemic damages (Fig. 2E). Suppression of Hypoxia-induced Cell Death by ARC in Cardiomyocytes—We then addressed sensitivity of the primary cardiomyocytes isolated from ARC Tg mice to hypoxia-induced cell death. Although the incubation of control cardiomyocytes in the hypoxic conditions induced 42% of cell death at 36 h, the hypoxic death rate in the same condition decreased to 20% in the cardiomyocytes prepared from ARC Tg mice (Fig. 3, A and B). These results show that the primary cardiomyocytes expressing ARC derived from ARC Tg mice are resistant to hypoxic cell death in vitro. Previously, we found that ARC may be a calcium-binding protein (25Jo D.G. Jun J.I. Chang J.W. Hong Y.M. Song S. Cho D.H. Shim S.M. Lee H.J. Cho C. Kim D.H. Jung Y.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 22: 9763-9770Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, we addressed whether ARC affects calcium overload-induced cell death of the primary cardiomyocytes. Incubation with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPase in the endoplasmic reticulum, induced 67% of cell death in WT cardiomyocytes but 30% in the cardiomyocytes cultured from the neonatal ARC Tg mice, indicating that ARC suppresses calcium overload-induced death of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3, C and D). We then analyzed the domain(s) of ARC responsible for the anti-hypoxic cell death activity using its deletion mutants (Fig. 4). The primary cardiomyocytes transiently transfected with ARC or ARC C terminus rich in proline and glutamate (Pro/Glu-rich domain) (CARC, amino acid residues, 99–208) were resistant to hypoxic cell death to a degree comparable with that of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, whereas the ARC N terminus (CARD domain) (NARC, amino acid residues, 1–98) failed to show such inhibitory effects on hypoxic cell death (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicate that ARC exhibits anti-hypoxic cell death activity in cardiomyocytes through its C-terminal Pro/Glu-rich region, a calcium-binding region. Altered Profiles of Gene Expression in the Heart of ARC Tg Mice—Given the vast number of effectors that might potentially influence the survival versus the apoptotic decision of myocardial cells after ischemia-reperfusion injury, we performed a large-scale genomic screening for altered gene expression. Specifically, hearts harvested from 3- and 30-week-old control and ARC Tg mice were analyzed for gene expression profiling using the GenePix 4000B array. This array contains all of the genes in the murine Unigene data base that have been functionally characterized (∼40,000). Heart samples were cross-compared between WT and ARC Tg mice, resulting in 170 genes being significantly detected in one or more groups after internal normalization. Of these genes, 39 genes exhibited significantly altered expression between the hearts of ARC Tg and WT mice (Table 1).TABLE 1Relative expression ratios of the selected groups of genes assessed by RNA microarray analysis Cardiac RNA was collected from two wild type and two ARC Tg mice (Tg 1, 3-week-old; Tg 2, 30-week-old) and subjected to expression profiling using the GenePix 4000B array. –Fold change filters include the requirement that the genes be present in at least 200% of the controls for up-regulated genes and in less than 50% of the controls for down-regulated genes.

OCIL was originally identified as an osteoblast-derived inhibitor of osteoclast formation in vitro. To determine the physiological function(s) of OCIL, we generated ocil-/- mice. These mice appeared healthy and were fertile, with no apparent immune function defect, and phenotypic abnormalities were limited to bone. Histomorphometric analysis revealed a significantly lower tibial trabecular bone volume and trabecular number in the 10- and 16-week-old male ocil-/- mice compared with wild type mice. Furthermore, ocil-/- mice showed reduced bone formation rate in the 10-week-old females and 16-week-old males while Static markers of bone formation showed no significant changes in male or female ocil-/- mice. Examination of bone resorption markers in the long bones of ocil-/- mice indicated a transient increase in osteoclast number per unit bone perimeter. Enhanced osteoclast formation was also observed when either bone marrow or splenic cultures were generated in vitro from ocil-/- mice relative to wild type control cultures. Loss of ocil therefore resulted in osteopenia in adult mice primarily as a result of increased osteoclast formation and/or decreased bone formation. The enhanced osteoclastic activity led to elevated serum calcium levels, which resulted in the suppression of circulating parathyroid hormone in 10-week-old ocil-/- mice compared with wild type control mice.

https://openalex.org/W2105170774,"The Escherichia coli disulfide isomerase, DsbC is a V-shaped homodimer with each monomer comprising a dimerization region that forms part of a putative peptide-binding pocket and a thioredoxin catalytic domain. Disulfide isomerases from prokaryotes and eukaryotes exhibit little sequence homology but display very similar structural organization with two thioredoxin domains facing each other on top of the dimerization/peptide-binding region. To aid the understanding of the mechanistic significance of thioredoxin domain dimerization and of the peptide-binding cleft of DsbC, we constructed a series of protein chimeras comprising unrelated protein dimerization domains fused to thioredoxin superfamily enzymes. Chimeras consisting of the dimerization domain and the alpha-helical linker of the bacterial proline cis/trans isomerase FkpA and the periplasmic oxidase DsbA gave rise to enzymes that catalyzed the folding of multidisulfide substrate proteins in vivo with comparable efficiency to E. coli DsbC. In addition, expression of FkpA-DsbAs conferred modest resistance to CuCl2, a phenotype that depends on disulfide bond isomerization. Selection for resistance to elevated CuCl2 concentrations led to the isolation of FkpA-DsbA mutants containing a single amino acid substitution that changed the active site of the DsbA domain from CPHC into CPYC, increasing the similarity to the DsbC active site (CGYC). Unlike DsbC, which is resistant to oxidation by DsbB-DsbA and does not normally catalyze disulfide bond formation under physiological conditions, the FkpA-DsbA chimeras functioned both as oxidases and isomerases. The engineering of these efficient artificial isomerases delineates the key features of catalysis of disulfide bond isomerization and enhances our understanding of its evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1984931879,"We have previously shown that caspase-mediated cleavage of Cyclin E generates p18-Cyclin E in hematopoietic tumor cells. Its expression can induce apoptosis or sensitize to apoptotic stimuli in many cell types. However, p18-cyclin E has a much shorter half-life than Cyclin E, being more effectively ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. A two-step process has emerged that regulates accelerated degradation of Cyclin E, with a caspase-mediated cleavage followed by enhanced proteasome-mediated degradation. We show that recognition of p18-Cyclin E by the Skp1-Cul1-Fbw7 (SCF) complex and its interaction with the Fbw7 protein isoforms can take place independently of phosphorylation of p18-Cyclin E at a C-terminal phosphodegron. In addition to the SCF(Fbw7) pathway, Ku70 binding that facilitates Hdm2 recruitment may also be implicated in p18-Cyclin E ubiquitination. Blocking p18-Cyclin E degradation with proteasome inhibitors increases levels of p18-Cyclin E and enhances its association with Ku70, thus leading to Bax release, its activation, and apoptosis. Moreover, cells expressing p18-Cyclin E are more sensitive to treatment with proteasome inhibitors, such as Bortezomib. By preventing its proteasomal degradation, p18-Cyclin E, but not Cyclin E, may become an effective therapeutic target for Bortezomib and apoptotic effectors in hematopoietic malignancies."

The best understood family members are the eukaryal RNA triphosphatases, which catalyze the initial step in mRNA capping. The RNA triphosphatases characteristically hydrolyze nucleoside 5′-triphosphates in the presence of manganese and are inept at cleaving inorganic tripolyphosphate. We recently identified a TTM protein from the bacterium Clostridium thermocellum (CthTTM) with the opposite substrate preference. Here we report that CthTTM catalyzes hydrolysis of guanosine 5′-tetraphosphate to yield GTP and Pi (Km = 70 μm, kcat = 170 s-1) much more effectively than it converts GTP to GDP and Pi (Km = 70 μm, kcat = 0.3 s-1), implying that a nucleoside interferes when positioned too close to the tunnel entrance. CthTTM is capable of quantitatively cleaving diadenosine hexaphosphate but has feeble activity with shorter derivatives diadenosine tetraphosphate and diadenosine pentaphosphate. We propose that the tunnel opens to accommodate the dumbbell-shaped diadenosine hexaphosphate and then closes around it to perform catalysis. We find that CthTTM can exhaustively hydrolyze a long-chain inorganic polyphosphate, a molecule that plays important roles in bacterial physiology. CthTTM differs from other known polyphosphatases in that it yields a ∼2:1 mixture of Pi and PPi end products. Bacterial/archaeal TTMs have a C-terminal helix located near the tunnel entrance. Deletion of this helix from CthTTM exerts pleiotropic effects.

The signature biochemical property of this branch of the TTM superfamily is the ability to hydrolyze NTPs to NDPs and Pi in the presence of manganese. The crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase Cet1 bound to manganese and sulfate (a proposed mimetic of the product complex with phosphate) revealed what was then a novel tertiary structure in which the active site is situated within a topologically closed tunnel composed of eight antiparallel β strands (2Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The Cet1-like TTM fold is conserved in the crystal structure of mimivirus RNA triphosphatase, which has an acetate anion bound in its tunnel (21Benarroch D. Smith P. Shuman S. Structure. 2008; 16: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A plausible mechanism has been proposed whereby Cet1-like proteins catalyze direct attack of a nucleophilic water on the γ-phosphorus of NTP or pppRNA substrates (4Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The putative water nucleophile is oriented by an essential glutamate contributed by the fifth β strand of the tunnel wall. A proposed pentacoordinate transition state is stabilized by interactions of the γ-phosphate oxygens with the divalent cation and a layer of essential lysine and arginine side chains that emanate from the third and sixth β strands of the tunnel walls. The octahedral metal coordination complex is formed by a set of essential conserved glutamates from strands β1 and β8 and an aspartate from β7 that are clustered on the floor of the tunnel. The tertiary structure and active site architecture of yeast and mimivirus RNA triphosphatases are recapitulated in the crystal structures of several archaeal and bacterial proteins, of mostly unknown biochemical function, that have been solved as a part of structural genomics initiatives; these include proteins from Pyrococcus (Protein Data Bank codes 1YEM, 2DC4, and 2EEN), Vibrio (2ACA), Nitrosomonas (2FBL), and Yersinia (2FJT) (3Gong C.

Given that bacterial and archaeal RNAs do not have 5′ caps, it is reasonable to think that members of this clade might play novel and diverse roles in prokaryotic physiology, to which insights might be gained by examining the activity and substrate specificity of exemplary family members. This theme is underscored by the identification and structural characterization of a mammalian enzyme, thiamine triphosphatase, as a TTM protein with extreme specificity for metal-dependent hydrolysis of thiamine triphosphate to thiamine diphosphate and Pi (Protein Data Bank codes 3BHD and 2JMU) (24Lakaye B. Makarchikov A.F. Antunes A.F. Zorzi, W. Coumans B. DePauw E. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorf L. J. Biol.

Here we focus our attention on Clostridium thermocellum TTM (CthTTM), the first bacterial TTM-type phosphohydrolase to be subjected to detailed biochemical and structure-function analysis (26Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant CthTTM is a vigorous inorganic tripolyphosphatase that converts PPPi to PPi plus Pi in the presence of manganese or magnesium. In fact, CthTTM is 2 orders of magnitude more active in cleaving PPPi than it is in hydrolyzing the β-γ phosphoanhydride of ATP (26Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). By contrast, the Cet1-like RNA triphosphatases are much more active with ATP than PPPi. Indeed, PPPi is a potent competitive inhibitor of their ATPase activity (11Gong C. Martins A. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50843-50852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Gong C. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15317-15324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We are interested in understanding the basis for the distinctive substrate preference of CthTTM and have been guided in this effort by crystal structures of homologous TTM proteins. The primary structure of the 156-amino acid CthTTM protein is aligned in Fig. 1A to two related prokaryotic TTM proteins, from Nitrosomonas europea (NeuTTM; 151 amino acids) and Pyrococcus horikoshii (PhoTTM; 165 amino acids), for which crystal structures have been solved (Fig. 1B), albeit without any functional characterization. As expected, the positions of side chain identity/similarity in the three proteins (indicated by dots) are located within the eight β strands that comprise the triphosphate tunnel of PhoTTM (Fig. 1A). The NeuTTM fold is distinguished by the fact that its antiparallel β barrel is not a closed tunnel, as in PhoTTM, but rather an open C-shaped “cup” that is prevented from closing by virtue of the insertion of a C-terminal helix into one end of the tunnel (Fig. 1B). In the open state, the essential amino acid side chains that comprise the active site are displaced from the catalytically active arrangement seen in the Cet1-Mn2+/SO42− complex (2Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We speculated previously that binding of the polyanionic substrate to the open conformation of the bacterial/archaeal-type TTM apoenzyme might trigger closure of the tunnel and the formation of a proper Michaelis complex (26Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similar inferences regarding substrate-induced conformational changes have been drawn for mammalian thiamine triphosphatase (25Song J. Bettendorf L. Tonelli M. Markley J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10939-10948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), based on documentation of alternative atomic structures analogous to the open and closed states depicted in Fig. 1B. By contrast, Cet1 has a topologically closed “O-shaped” tunnel that cannot open, because the crossover strands of the Cet1 tunnel penetrate into a globular pedestal domain upon which the tunnel rests (2Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, because no TTM protein structure has been solved with a true substrate (NTP, RNA, or thiamine triphosphate) bound at the active site, we cannot confidently know the orientation of the substrate and the site of asymmetric hydrolysis of the phosphoanhydride linkage. Nevertheless, many TTM structures have been solved with anionic ligands in the tunnel (e.g. sulfate, phosphate, citrate, acetate, or chloride). In this respect, it is striking that the closed tunnel conformation in the PhoTTM structure correlates with the presence of a linear array of three chloride anions in the tunnel cavity (Fig. 1B), which are putative mimetics of three phosphates of the enzyme's substrate. A detailed stereo view of the PhoTTM tunnel is shown in Fig. 1C (albeit with the conserved amino acids of the tunnel numbered according to their positions in CthTTM). The tunnel is oriented in Fig. 1 so that the chloride anion closest to the viewer corresponds to the sulfate in Cet1; thus, we regard this atom as a potential analog of the γ-phosphate and, by extension, the two other chlorides serially deeper in the tunnel as rough analogs of the β- and α-phosphates, respectively. Many of the conserved polar side chains surrounding the chlorides have been shown by mutational analysis to be essential for CthTTM triphosphatase activity (26Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is critical to note that the C-terminal α helix of PhoTTM sterically occludes the back opening of the tunnel even after closure has occurred (Fig. 1, B and C). This C-terminal “plug” helix is a conserved feature of all of the structurally characterized bacterial and archaeal TTM proteins as well as mammalian thiamine triphosphatase. By contrast, a plug helix is conspicuously absent from yeast and mimivirus RNA triphosphatases, which have unobstructed “entrance” and “exit” sides to their tunnels (2Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Benarroch D. Smith P. Shuman S. Structure. 2008; 16: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The plug helix in PhoTTM blocks the side corresponding to the putative entrance to the Cet1 tunnel; the open side closer to the viewer in Fig. 1C corresponds to the putative exit side of the Cet1 tunnel. We envision that the plug helix must move away from the tunnel entrance in order for an NTP to bind productively and for efficient hydrolysis and product release. This idea was supported by the initial finding that an alanine mutation of CthTTM residue Lys8, which in Pho-TTM tethers the plug helix to the tunnel opening via a hydrogen bond to the main chain of the plug helix (Fig. 1C), stimulated the ATPase activity of CthTTM (26Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we delve further into the catalytic repertoire of CthTTM by studying its ability to cleave longer nucleotide 5′-polyphosphate and inorganic polyphosphate substrates. Our results suggest that opening of the tunnel is relevant to productive substrate binding, and they underscore the role of the C-terminal helix as a substrate filter. Materials—Guanosine 5′-tetraphosphate (Gpppp), P1,P4-di(adenosine-5′) tetraphosphate (AppppA), P1,P5-di(adenosine-5′) pentaphosphate (ApppppA), P1,P6-di(adenosine-5′) hexaphosphate (AppppppA), and Crotalus adamanteus nucleotide pyrophosphatase were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Calf intestine phosphatase (CIP) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was purchased from Qiagen. Malachite green reagent was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories. Polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cellulose TLC plates were from Baker. Recombinant CthTTM—Full-length CthTTM and the C-terminal truncation mutant CthTTM-(1-137) were produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as N-terminal His10-tagged fusions and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by sequential Ni2+-agarose and DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography steps, as described previously (26Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The yields of CthTTM and CthTTM-(1-137) from a 250-ml bacterial culture were 11 and 9 mg, respectively. The protein preparations were stored at -80 °C. Recombinant Polyphosphate Kinase (PPK)—The E. coli ppk open reading frame was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA with primers that introduced an NdeI site at the start codon and a BamHI site immediately after the stop codon. The ppk gene was inserted into pET16B so as to fuse the coding sequence to a 5′ leader encoding a His10 tag. The pET-PPK plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). A 500-ml culture derived from a single transformant was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached ∼0.6, at which time the culture was adjusted to 2% ethanol and 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The culture was then incubated at 17 °C for 16 h with continuous shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at -80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 50 ml of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 1 mg/ml, 0.2 mm, and 0.1%, respectively. The lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extract was applied to a 5-ml column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100). The column was washed with 15 ml of the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 2-ml aliquots of 50, 100, 200, and 500 mm imidazole in buffer A. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant His10-PPK polypeptide was recovered predominantly in the 500 mm imidazole fraction, which was then dialyzed against 200 mm NaCl in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100). The yield was 0.2 mg of PPK from a 500-ml bacterial culture. The PPK preparation was stored at -80 °C. Preparation of [32P]Polyphosphate—A reaction mixture (0.5 ml) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 18 pmol of E. coli PPK was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 50 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Conversion of ATP to polyphosphate was gauged by PEI-cellulose TLC analysis of aliquots of the reaction mixture with or without PPK. Ascending TLC with 0.75 m LiCl, 1 m HCOOH separated the free radiolabeled ATP from the polymeric PPK reaction product that remained at the origin. Approximately 20% of input [γ-32P]ATP was converted to polyphosphate via this procedure. The [32P]polyphosphate was purified as described by Keasling et al. (27Keasling J.D. Bertsch L. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7029-7033Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), with some modifications. The quenched reaction mixture was extracted once with an equal volume of phenol-CHCl3 and then twice with CHCl3. Isopropyl alcohol (0.7 volume) was then added to the aqueous phase, and the solution was left at room temperature for 1 h. The mixture was microcentrifuged at 15,000 rpm, and the supernatant was discarded. Cold 100% ethanol was added to the polyphosphate-containing precipitate, and the tube was kept on dry ice for 30 min. This was followed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded again, and the precipitate was rinsed with cold 70% ethanol. After repeat centrifugation and removal of the ethanol supernatant, the precipitated [32P]polyphosphate was dried and then dissolved in water. PEI-cellulose TLC confirmed that all free radiolabeled ATP had been removed. The total phosphate concentration of the polyphosphate preparation was determined by digestion with CIP, which quantitatively liberated the radiolabel as 32Pi, as verified by TLC. The phosphate content of the CIP hydrolysate was determined colorimetrically with the malachite green reagent. The concentrated [32P]polyphosphate preparation (11.7 mm phosphate) was stored at -20 °C and diluted prior to use in polyphosphatase assays. Nucleoside Tetraphosphatase Activity of CthTTM—Prompted by our initial finding that CthTTM was ∼150-fold more active with PPPi than ATP (26Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we speculated that the nucleoside might sterically hinder productive substrate binding in the active site. This hypothesis engenders a prediction that CthTTM should regain activity if the interfering nucleoside moiety were shifted away from the terminal phosphoanhydride linkage that undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis. Thus, we queried whether CthTTM could catalyze phosphate release from a nucleoside 5′-tetraphosphate substrate, Gpppp. We found that CthTTM did cleave 100 μm Gpppp in the presence of 200 μm manganese and that the extent of Pi release as a function of input enzyme was acutely biphasic (Fig. 2A). Pi release was steeply proportional to the amount of enzyme added up to 1 ng of CthTTM, at which point the molar yield of phosphate was equal to the initial amount of Gpppp substrate. Further phosphate release displayed a much shallower dependence on increasing CthTTM from 50 to 400 ng. The specific activities calculated from the slope of the steep and shallow phases corresponded to turnover numbers of 150 and 0.07 s-1, respectively. We ascribe the initial steep phase to efficient and quantitative conversion of Gpppp to GTP and Pi at low enzyme concentrations, followed by a shallow phase of inefficient conversion of GTP to GDP and Pi at higher enzyme concentrations. Indeed, the enzyme dependence of Pi release from 100 μm GTP substrate under the same reaction conditions was 0.06 s-1 (Fig. 2A), a value virtually identical to that of the shallow phase of the Gpppp titration profile. Thus, CthTTM is 2100-fold more active on a nucleoside 5′-tetraphosphate than on a standard NTP under these conditions. A different profile of enzyme dependence was observed when CthTTM was reacted with 100 μm Gpppp in the presence of magnesium (Fig. 2B). Here, Pi release was monophasic and proportional to enzyme (estimated turnover number 70 s-1). The reaction attained an insurmountable plateau when 1 mol of phosphate was released/mol of input Gpppp substrate, presumably corresponding to quantitative conversion of Gpppp to a GTP product. To verify this interpretation, the fate of the Gpppp nucleotide moiety in the presence of CthTTM and magnesium was monitored by PEI-cellulose TLC in buffer containing 1.25 m LiCl, 1 m HCOOH. This procedure revealed complete conversion of Gpppp to GTP, with no detectable GDP formation (not shown). Moreover, a parallel titration experiment with GTP as the substrate verified that the enzyme was unable to catalyze release of Pi from GTP in the presence of magnesium (Fig. 2B). These results agree with previous findings (26Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that CthTTM performs ATP hydrolysis with manganese but not magnesium. Further characterization of the tetraphosphatase showed that Pi accumulated steadily with time and that the rate of release of Pi from Gpppp was proportional to enzyme concentration with either manganese or magnesium as the cofactor (Fig. 2, C and D). Hydrolysis of Gpppp by CthTTM required divalent metal ion and was optimal in Tris buffer at pH 8.5 with either manganese or magnesium (not shown). Various divalent metal ions were tested at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 20 mm. As noted above, manganese supported the highest specific activity (150 s-1) at its optimal concentration of 200 μm, whereas magnesium was half as effective (70 s-1) at its optimum concentration of 20 mm. Cobalt supported much lower activity (5 s-1) at its optimum of 200 μm. We detected no tetraphosphatase activity with calcium, cadmium, copper, nickel, or zinc. The extent of Pi release in the presence of 0.2 mm manganese displayed a hyperbolic dependence on Gpppp concentration (not shown). From a double-reciprocal plot of the data, we calculated a Km of 70 μm Gpppp and a kcat of 170 s-1. The steadystate kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and Pi under optimal reaction conditions (pH 8.0; 2 mm MnCl2) were as follows: Km = 70 μm GTP and kcat = 0.3 s-1. Thus, CthTTM discriminated between the nucleoside tetraphosphate and triphosphate by a factor of 570 at the level of reaction chemistry rather than initial substrate binding. The kinetic parameters for Gpppp hydrolysis in 20 mm magnesium were as follows: Km = 86 μm Gpppp and kcat = 96 s-1. The turnover number for magnesium-dependent Gpppp hydrolysis was similar to the value of 63 s-1 reported for magnesium-dependent hydrolysis of PPPi (26Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The failure of CthTTM to hydrolyze GTP in the presence of magnesium was at least partly reflective of weak substrate binding, insofar as the addition of excess GTP had only a weak inhibitory effect on magnesium-dependent hydrolysis of Gpppp. Specifically, the extents of Pi release from 0.2 mm Gpppp in the presence of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 mm GTP were 98, 90, 85, and 78% of the control reaction lacking GTP (not shown). Effects of Alanine Mutations on CthTTM Tetraphosphatase Activity—We surveyed a collection of alanine mutants of CthTTM (26Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) for their ability to hydrolyze Gpppp (Fig. 3). Mutants E6A, R39A, R41A, K52A, E62A, K87A, R89A, and E117A were shown previously to have <1% of the specific activity of wild-type CthTTM in manganese-dependent ATP hydrolysis; mutants E4A and E115A were 3% as active as wild-type CthTTM in ATP hydrolysis (26Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we find that each of these changes, involving amino acids in the tunnel active site (Fig. 1C), had similarly severe effects on the hydrolysis of Gpppp, no matter what the divalent cation cofactor (Fig. 3). E64A, shown previously to have 3% of wild-type ATPase activity and 7% of wild-type tripolyphosphatase activity in the presence of manganese (26Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was found here to be 12% (Mn2+) or 17% (Mg2+) as active as wild-type CthTTM in hydrolyzing guanosine tetraphosphate (Fig. 3).

When protein S was added to phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (PC/PS, 4:1) vesicle-bound DEGR-fXa(i), the anisotropy of the dansyl moiety was altered from 0.219 +/- 0.002 to 0.245 +/- 0.003. This change in dansyl anisotropy was not observed when DEGR-Xa(i) was titrated with protein S in the absence of PC/PS vesicles, or in the presence of 100% PC vesicles, or when PC/PS vesicle-bound DEGR-fXa(i) was titrated with thrombin-cleaved protein S. The protein S-dependent dansyl fluorescence change was specific for fXa because it was not observed for two homologous and similarly labeled DEGR-fIXa(i) and DEGR-fVIIa(i). Furthermore, protein S specifically and saturably altered the fluorescence anisotropy of PC/PS-bound active site-labeled LWB-FPR-fXa(i) (Kd = 33 nm) and was photocross-linked to PC/PS-bound LWB-FPR-fXa(i) analog, independently confirming the above results. Chemically synthesized microprotein S, comprising residues 1-116 of protein S and including the gamma-carboxyglutamic-rich domain, the thrombin-sensitive region (TSR), and the first epidermal growth factor-like domain (EGF1) of protein S, altered the anisotropy of PC/PS-bound DEGR-fXa(i) from 0.219 to 0.242, similar to the effect of the protein S titration (Kd = 303 nm), suggesting that microprotein S binds to DEGR-fXa(i). To identify individual protein S domain(s) that binds DEGR-fXa(i), the EGF1 and TSR domains were chemically synthesized and studied. The TSR altered the anisotropy of DEGR-fXa(i) by approximately 16% (Kd = 3.9 microm), but the EGF1 domain had no effect on the signal. In controls, the TSR domain did not alter the anisotropy of DEGR-fIXa(i) and DEGR-fVIIa(i), respectively. These data demonstrate that membrane-bound fXa binding to protein S involves the TSR of protein S."
https://openalex.org/W2089109139,"Fat accumulation has been classically considered as a means of energy storage. Obese people are theorized as metabolically ‘thrifty’, saving energy during times of food abundance. However, recent research has highlighted many neuro-behavioral and social aspects of obesity, with a suggestion that obesity, abdominal obesity in particular, may have evolved as a social signal. We tested here whether body proportions, and abdominal obesity in particular, are perceived as signals revealing personality traits. Faceless drawings of three male body forms namely lean, muscular and feminine, each with and without abdominal obesity were shown in a randomized order to a group of 222 respondents. A list of 30 different adjectives or short descriptions of personality traits was given to each respondent and they were asked to allocate the most appropriate figure to each of them independently. The traits included those directly related to physique, those related to nature, attitude and moral character and also those related to social status. For 29 out of the 30 adjectives people consistently attributed specific body forms. Based on common choices, the 30 traits could be clustered into distinct ‘personalities’ which were strongly associated with particular body forms. A centrally obese figure was perceived as “lethargic, greedy, political, money-minded, selfish and rich”. The results show that body proportions are perceived to reflect personality traits and this raises the possibility that in addition to energy storage, social selection may have played some role in shaping the biology of obesity."
