https://openalex.org/W2091876286,"We have investigated the structures formed by oligonucleotides composed of two or four repeats of the telomeric sequences from Oxytricha and Tetrahymena. The Oxytricha four-repeat molecule (d(T4G4)4 = Oxy-4) forms structures with increased electrophoretic mobility in nondenaturing gels containing Na+, K+, or Cs+, but not in gels containing Li+ or no added salt. Formation of the folded structure results in protection of a set of dG's from methylation by dimethyl sulfate. Efficient UV-induced cross-links are observed in Oxy-4 and the related sequence from Tetrahymena (d(T2G4)4 = Tet-4), and join thymidine residues in different repeats. Models proposed to account for these data involve G-quartets, hydrogen-bonded structures formed from four guanosine residues in a square-planar array. We propose that the G-quartet structure must be dealt with in vivo by the telomere replication machinery."

https://openalex.org/W2042489614,"Hematogenous metastasis requires the arrest and extravasation of blood-borne tumor cells, possibly involving direct adhesive interactions with vascular endothelium. Cytokine activation of cultured human endothelium increases adhesion of melanoma and carcinoma cell lines. An inducible 110-kD endothelial cell surface glycoprotein, designated INCAM-110, appears to mediate adhesion of melanoma cells. In addition, an inducible endothelial receptor for neutrophils, ELAM-1, supports the adhesion of a human colon carcinoma cell line. Thus, activation of vascular endothelium in vivo that results in increased expression of INCAM-110 and ELAM-1 may promote tumor cell adhesion and affect the incidence and distribution of metastases."

https://openalex.org/W2063664890,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was originally characterized as a survival factor for chick ciliary neurons in vitro. More recently, it was shown to promote the survival of a variety of other neuronal cell types and to affect the differentiation of E7 chick sympathetic neurons by inhibiting their proliferation and by inducing the expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide immunoreactivity (VIP-IR). In cultures of dissociated sympathetic neurons from newborn rats, CNTF induces cholinergic differentiation as shown by increased levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). This increase is paralleled by a reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity. Moreover, CNTF promotes the differentiation of bipotential 02A progenitor cells to type-2-astrocytes in vitro. To help establish which, if any, of these functions CNTF exerts in vivo, it is necessary to determine its primary structure, cellular expression, developmental regulation and localization. The complementary DNA-deduced amino-acid sequence and subsequent expression of cDNA clones covering the entire coding region in HeLa-cells indicate that CNTF is a cytosolic protein. This, together with its regional distribution and its developmental expression, show that CNTF is not a target-derived neurotrophic factor. CNTF thus seems to exhibit neurotrophic and differentiation properties only after becoming available either by cellular lesion or by an unknown release mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2012621186,"Nucleotide sequences of a large number of V-(D)-J junctions of T cell receptor (TCR) γ and δ genes show that most fetal thymocytes express on their surface one of just two γδ TCRs known to be expressed by epidermal γδ T cells (s-IEL) or intraepithelial γδ T cells associated with female reproductive organs (r-IEL). In contrast, γδ TCRs expressed on adult thymocytes are highly diverse as a result of multiple combinations of gene segments as well as junctional deletions and insertions, indicating that developmental time- and cell lineage-dependent mechanisms exist that control the extent of γδ TCR diversity. In addition, this study revealed a new type of junctional insertion (P nucleotides), which led to a new model of V-(D)-J joining generally applicable to immunoglobulin and TCR genes."
https://openalex.org/W2040385763,"The minimal DNA sequence required for the formation of a stable complex with Drosophila heat shock factor (HSF) in vitro is an inverted repeat of a 5 bp recognition unit, -GAA-. Surprisingly, both permutations of this 5 bp unit, head-to-head and tail-to-tail, bind to HSF with similar affinity and with striking 2-fold symmetry. HSF also binds to longer arrays of inverted 5 bp units, and the size of the HSF footprint increases with the addition of each 5 bp unit to these arrays. However, the electrophoretic mobility of the HSF-DNA complexes decreases most distinctly with the addition of every three 5 bp units. Cross-linking of purified HSF in the absence of DNA generates complexes with the sizes expected of HSF trimers. We propose that trimers of HSF bind to DNA and that the number of HSF subunits in direct contact with DNA is determined by the number of correctly positioned 5 bp recognition units."
https://openalex.org/W2057835832,Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is one of a small number of proteins with neurotrophic activities distinct from nerve growth factor (NGF). CNTF has now been purified and cloned and the primary structure of CNTF from rabbit sciatic nerve has been determined. Biologically active CNTF has been transiently expressed from a rabbit complementary DNA clone. CNTF is a neural effector without significant sequence homologies to any previously reported protein.
https://openalex.org/W4235925468,"The human retinoblastoma gene (RB1) encodes a protein (Rb) of 105 kilodaltons that can be phosphorylated. Analysis of Rb metabolism has shown that the protein has a half-life of more than 10 hours and is synthesized at all phases of the cell cycle. Newly synthesized Rb is not extensively phosphorylated (it is ""underphosphorylated"") in cells in the G0 and G1 phases but is phosphorylated at multiple sites at the G1/S boundary and in S phase. HL-60 cells that were induced to terminally differentiate by various chemicals lost their ability to phosphorylate newly synthesized Rb at multiple sites when cell growth was arrested. These findings suggest that underphosphorylated Rb may restrict cell proliferation."

A 1,25(OH)2D3-responsive element (VDRE), which is within the promoter for osteocalcin [a bone protein induced by 1,25(OH)2D3] is unresponsive to other steroid hormones, can function in a heterologous promoter, and contains a doubly palindromic DNA sequence (TTGGTGACTCACCGGGTGAAC; -513 to -493 bp), with nucleotide sequence homology to other hormone responsive elements. The potent glucocorticoid repression of 1,25(OH)2D3 induction and of basal activity of this promoter acts through a region between -196 and +34 bp, distinct from the VDRE."
https://openalex.org/W2027076688,"The functional, high affinity form of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) is composed of two receptor components, the IL-2R alpha (p55) and IL-2R beta (p70-75) chains. Unlike the IL-2R alpha chain, the IL-2R beta chain contains a large cytoplasmic domain that shows no obvious tyrosine kinase motif. In the present study, we report the establishment of a system in which the cDNA-directed human IL-2R beta allows growth signal transduction in a mouse pro-B cell line. This system enabled us to identify a unique region within the cytoplasmic domain of the human IL-2R beta chain essential for ligand-mediated signal transduction. We also demonstrate that certain cytoplasmic deletion mutants in the IL-2R beta chain, although deficient in signal transduction, can still form high affinity IL-2R in conjunction with endogenous mouse IL-2R alpha chain; the mutants are still able to internalize the ligand as well."
https://openalex.org/W1482472937,"Abstract The present study has examined the effect of elevated glucose levels on membrane lipid peroxidation and osmotic fragility in human red blood cells (RBC). Defibrinated whole blood or RBC were incubated with varying concentrations of glucose at 37 degrees C for 24 h. RBC incubated with elevated levels of glucose showed a significantly increased membrane lipid peroxidation when compared with control RBC. A significant positive correlation was observed between the extent of glucose-induced membrane lipid peroxidation and the osmotic fragility of treated RBC. Glucose-induced membrane lipid peroxidation and osmotic fragility were blocked when RBC were pretreated with fluoride, an inhibitor of glucose metabolism; with vitamin E, an antioxidant; with para-chloromercurobenzoate and metyrapone, inhibitors of the cytochrome P-450 system; or with dimethylfurane, diphenylamine, and thiourea, scavengers of oxygen radicals. RBC treated with elevated glucose concentrations also showed an increase in NADPH levels. Exogenous addition of NADPH to normal RBC lysate induced membrane lipid peroxidation similar to that observed in the glucose-treated RBC. These data suggest that elevated glucose levels can cause the peroxidation of membrane lipids in human RBC."

https://openalex.org/W2121986819,"Mutations in the BicaudalD (BicD) gene lead to a global reorganization of the Drosophila body pattern such that the head, thoracic, and anterior abdominal segments are replaced by posterior abdominal segments and terminalia. We first provide evidence that the primary cause of this phenotype is the inhibition of two anterior factors, bicoid and hunchback, by mislocalized activity of the posterior determinant nanos. We then describe the isolation of the BicD gene and show that it encodes a coiled-coil protein similar to the carboxy-terminal portion of the myosin heavy chain. Finally, we find that BicD protein is uniformly distributed throughout wild-type oocytes but is concentrated at the anterior pole of BicD mutant oocytes together with ectopic nanos activity. Taken together, these results suggest that BicD encodes a cytoskeleton-like protein involved in transporting or anchoring the nanos morphogen within the oocyte cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W1549183351,"Abstract The ability of plasma proteinase inhibitors to inactivate human chymase, a chymotrypsin-like proteinase stored within mast cell secretory granules, was investigated. Incubation with plasma resulted in over 80% inhibition of chymase hydrolytic activity for small substrates, suggesting that inhibitors other than alpha 2-macroglobulin were primarily responsible for chymase inactivation. Depletion of specific inhibitors from plasma by immunoadsorption using antisera against individual inhibitors established that alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (alpha 1-AC) and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI) were responsible for the inactivation. Characterization of the reaction between chymase and each inhibitor demonstrated in both cases the presence of two concurrent reactions proceeding at fixed relative rates. One reaction, which led to inhibitor inactivation, was about 3.5 and 4.0-fold faster than the other, which led to chymase inactivation. This was demonstrated in linear titrations of proteinase activity which exhibited endpoint stoichiometries of 4.5 (alpha 1-AC) and 5.0 (alpha 1-PI) instead of unity, and SDS gels of reaction products which exhibited a banding pattern indicative of both an SDS-stable proteinase-inhibitor complex and two lower Mr inhibitor degradation products which appear to have formed by hydrolysis within the reactive loop of each inhibitor. At inhibitor concentrations approaching those in plasma where inhibitor to chymase concentration ratios were in far excess of 4.5 and 5.0, the rate of chymase inactivation by both serpin inhibitors appeared to follow pseudo-first order kinetics. The apparent second order rate constants of inactivation determined from these data were about 3000-fold lower than the rate constants reported for human neutrophil cathepsin G and elastase with alpha 1-AC and alpha 1-PI, respectively. This suggests that chymase would be inhibited about 650-fold more slowly than these proteinases when released into plasma. These studies demonstrate that although chymase is inactivated by serpin inhibitors of plasma, both inhibitors are better substrates for the proteinase than they are inhibitors. This finding along with the slow rates of inactivation indicates that regulation of human chymase activity may not be a primary function of plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1508904325,"In eukaryotic cells, chromatin is organized as domains or loops that are generated by periodic attachment of the chromatin fiber to protein components of a nuclear matrix, or scaffold. These chromosomal loops may have a function in gene regulation. The length of the chromatin domain encompassing the human apolipoprotein B gene was studied by determining the locations of nuclear matrix attachment sites as well as the boundaries of the DNase I-sensitive domain in cells that express the gene (such as HepG2 and CaCo-2 cells) and in those that do not (HeLa cells). Three nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs) of the human apolipoprotein B gene have been localized: a 3' -proximal MAR, between nucleotides +43,186 and +43,850; a 5' -proximal MAR, between nucleotides -2,765 and -1,801; and a 5' -distal MAR, between nucleotides -5,262 and -4,048. Both the 3' -proximal and the 5' -distal MARS were present in cells that express the gene (HepG2 and CaCo-2 cells) as well as in cells that do not (HeLa cells), whereas the 5' -proximal MAR was detected only in HepG2 cells. These MARs were located at the bases of chromosomal loops in histone-extracted nuclei in all three cell lines. Various classes of A/T-rich sequences resembling the recognition site for topoisomerase II were present within the MAR-containing fragments. The boundaries of the DNase I-sensitive domain coincide with the positions of the 3' -proximal and 5' -distal matrix attachment sites. These results suggest the existence of a 47.5-kilobase domain that represents a topologically sequestered functional unit containing the coding region and all known cis-acting regulatory elements of the human apolipoprotein B gene."
https://openalex.org/W1533065115,"A serum-free primary culture system for chicken growth plate chondrocytes has been developed which consistently undergoes mineral deposition. Upon attainment of confluency, the chondrocytes develop locally into multilayer cellular nodules leading to matrix calcification. Mineralization first occurs in matrix vesicles (MV) that are abundant in the extraterritorial matrix between the hypertrophic cells. Studies with 45Ca reveal that significant accumulation of Ca2+ occurs as early as day 12, continuing progressively throughout the culture period. By day 24, the nodules become densely calcified. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals the mineral to be similar to apatite, with features essentially identical to those of mineral formed by MV in vitro. The presence of ascorbate is critical to the culture system; in its absence, calcification is rarely observed. Ascorbate stimulates MV formation and synthesis of cellular protein, alkaline phosphatase, and especially types II and X collagens. In addition, there is strong evidence that the types II and X collagens are associated with MV. 1) Electron microscopy reveals MV embedded in a type II collagenous network; 2) Western blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of MV using monospecific antibodies to types X and II collagen indicate that both collagens are present in specific MV fractions; 3) sucrose gradient purification of MV does not remove associated collagens; 4) graded salt extraction selectively releases type II collagen from MV; and 5) incubation of radiolabeled types II and X collagens with MV leads to their cosedimentation upon subsequent centrifugation. Taken together, the data suggest that coordinated synthesis of the collagens, alkaline phosphatase, MV formation, and Ca2+ accumulation by the cultures combine to induce mineral deposition in the multilayer nodules."
https://openalex.org/W1483199141,"Abstract A number of different protein kinases phosphorylate purified heavy chains or the 20-kDa light chain of smooth muscle myosin. The physiological significance of these phosphorylation reactions has been examined in intact smooth muscle. Myosin heavy chain was slightly phosphorylated (0.08 mol of phosphate/mol) under control conditions in bovine tracheal tissue. Treatment with carbachol, isoproterenol, or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate resulted in no significant change. In contrast, heavy chain was phosphorylated to 0.30 mol of phosphate/mol of heavy chain in tracheal smooth muscle cells in culture. This value increased significantly with ionomycin treatment. In control tissues, 9% of the light chain was monophosphorylated with 32P in the serine site phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase. Carbachol (0.1 microM) alone resulted in contraction and 42% monophosphorylated light chain with 32P only in the serine site phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase. Similarly, stimulation with histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or KCl resulted in 32P incorporation into only the myosin light chain kinase serine site. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (1 microM) alone resulted in 22% monophosphorylated light chain. However, only 25% of the 32P was in the myosin light chain kinase serine site, whereas 75% was in a serine site phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate plus carbachol resulted in 27% monophosphorylated light chain; 75% of the 32P was in the myosin light chain kinase serine site, with the remainder in the protein kinase C serine site. These results indicate that phorbol esters act to increase phosphorylation of myosin light chain by protein kinase C. However, receptor-mediated stimulation or depolarization leading to tracheal smooth muscle contraction results in phosphorylation of myosin light chain by myosin light chain kinase alone."
https://openalex.org/W1581342205,"The diasteromers of 5,10-dideaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (DDATHF) differing in chirality about carbon 6 were resolved and studied as inhibitors of folate-dependent processes in mouse leukemia cells. Both diastereomers of DDATHF were found to be potent inhibitors of leukemia cell growth due to effects on de novo purine synthesis. Cell growth inhibition by these compounds was prevented by 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in a dose-dependent manner. This indicated that the effects of the DDATHF diastereomers were due to inhibition of folate-dependent processes. Metabolite reversal experiments indicated that 5‵-phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase was the major site of action of these compounds in mouse cells. Another site in de novo purine synthesis was affected at higher concentrations of diastereomer B in L1210 cells. Low concentrations of both diastereomers were found to inhibit pure L1210 5‵-phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase competitively with the folate substrate. The two diastereomers were also efficient substrates for mouse liver folylpolyglutamate synthetase. We conclude that the 6R- and 6S-diastereomers of DDATHF are remarkably similar and equiactive antimetabolites inhibitory to de novo purine synthesis and that the biochemical processes involved in their cytotoxicity display little stereochemical specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1602807911,"Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that Sertoli cell-enriched culture medium contained two immunologically and structurally related proteins designated CMB-22 and CMB-23 with Mr of 37,000 and 40,000, respectively. We have now demonstrated that both CMB-22 and CMB-23 are monomeric proteins with the following NH2-terminal amino acid sequences: CMB-22, NH2-TPDPSLDVEWNEWRTKHGKTYNMNEERLKR; CMB-23, NH2-XAPXPDPSLDVEXNEXRTK. These sequences are virtually identical except that CMB-23 has three extra NH2 terminus amino acids of X-A-P. Comparison of these sequences with those in the Protein Identification Resource revealed that they are unique proteins. CMB-22 and CMB-23 are highly concentrated in testes and their levels in this tissue increase with age. Studies using [35S]methionine incorporation and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Sertoli cells synthesize and secrete these proteins in vitro. Because they seem not to have been isolated previously, are concentrated in and synthesized by the testes, and are structurally related, we propose that CMB-22 and CMB-23 be designated testin I and testin II, respectively. The distribution of these proteins in biological fluids were compared with those of testibumin and rat androgen binding protein (rABP), two other Sertoli cell proteins. The results suggest that testins, unlike testibumin and rABP, are not transported to the epididymis. Although the amount of testins secreted by Sertoli cells in vitro is similar to that of testibumin and rABP, the concentrations in testis and rete testis fluid are several orders of magnitude less than that of testibumin and rABP. These observations suggest that the secretion of these proteins in vivo might be suppressed by germ cells. The fact that 10 times more testins are secreted by tubules from immature rats than by those from adult rats and that there is an increase in the testicular content of testins following a single dose of busulfan, which depleted the germ cells from the seminiferous epithelium, supports this hypothesis. Thus, the secretion of testins by Sertoli cells appears to be tightly coupled to the presence of germ cells; there is an inverse relationship between the amount of testins in the testis and the number of germ cells. These results suggest that testins are unique testicular proteins that can be used to study Sertoli cell-germ cell interactions in the seminiferous epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1964983642,"The mature T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is the result of selection events during T cell development. Previous assessment of TCR β-chain selection with serologic and molecular probes demonstrated both positive and negative selection. Although this work suggested a critical role for the thymus, no direct assessment has been made of the requirement for a thymus in TCR Vβ selection. A comparison of TCR Vβ expression in four different congenic pairs of normal and nu/nu (athymic) mice indicated that the normal Vβ deletions associated with tolerance to self minor lymphocyte stimulating (Mlsc) antigens or to self major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded EαEβ products did not occur in most athymic mice. Thus, the thymus has a critical role in mediating self tolerance by negative selection."
https://openalex.org/W2064348378,"Although most animals reproduce sexually, a number of all-female groups exist. Triploid hybrid salamanders appear to maintain themselves by using a male's sperm to activate their eggs, after which the sperm nucleus is eliminated (gynogenesis). The incidence of sperm nuclear incorporation in eggs of these salamanders depends on temperature. Triploid offspring derived gynogenetically are more frequent at lower temperature, whereas tetraploid offspring derived sexually are far more frequent at higher temperatures. Temperature-dependent variability in sperm nuclear incorporation helps explain the variability in reproductive modes reported for hybrid salamanders."
https://openalex.org/W2101740285,"Microtubules are fibers of the cytoskeleton involved in the generation of cell shape and motility. They can be highly dynamic and are capable of temporal oscillations in their state of assembly. Solutions of tubulin (the subunit protein of microtubules) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP, the cofactor required for microtubule assembly and oscillations) can generate various dissipative structures. They include traveling waves of microtubule assembly and disassembly as well as polygonal networks. The results imply that cytoskeletal proteins can form dynamic spatial structures by themselves, even in the absence of cellular organizing centers. Thus the microtubule system could serve as a simple model for studying pattern formation by biomolecules in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1569035747,"The crystal structure of the cooperative dimeric hemoglobin from the arcid clam, Scapharca inaequivalvis, has been determined in the carbonmonoxy state. The phase problem was solved for reflections with Bragg spacings greater than 3 A using anomalous scattering from the porphyrin iron atoms measured at a single wavelength in combination with molecular averaging. The model built into this electron density map has been refined at 2.4 A resolution by means of stereochemically restrained least squares minimization to a conventional R-value of 0.156. The root mean square deviation from ideal bond lengths and angles are 0.013 A and 1.7 °, respectively. In addition to the 2336 hemoglobin atoms, 214 water molecules have been incorporated into the model. This structure reveals the details of an assemblage of two identical myoglobin-like subunits that is radically different from vertebrate hemoglobins. The subunit interface is formed by direct apposition of the E and F helices, whereas these surfaces are external in vertebrate hemoglobins. The interface has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic character. Two symmetrically related hydrophobic regions are formed between subunits. Six residues are involved in each of these regions that pack tightly enough to exclude water but have only a few atoms in close van der Waals contact. A number of ordered water molecules line the interface and form bridging hydrogen bonds between subunits. Four intersubunit ionic interactions are formed, two of which involve negatively charged propionate groups of the porphyrin. In contrast to cooperative vertebrate hemoglobins, a hydrogen bond network provides a direct route for communication between the two heme groups."
https://openalex.org/W1660569653,"Several proteins involved in transmembrane signaling have been shown previously to be modified covalently by long-chain fatty acids. Using the BC3H1 cell line, which contains a broad array of fatty acylated proteins, we have examined the possibility that acylation of certain proteins is modulated in response to mitogenic stimulation. In the present study, we describe a 64-kDa palmitoylated protein, referred to as p64, that is deacylated following stimulation of quiescent cells with fetal bovine serum, fibroblast growth factor, and phorbol dibutyrate. Western blot analysis of membrane and soluble fractions using a polyclonal antibody against p64 revealed that approximately 70% of p64 in unstimulated cells is present in the cytosol in a non-acylated form, whereas palmitoylated p64 is found exclusively in the membrane fraction. Extraction of membranes with 0.5 M sodium chloride, 0.2 M sodium pyrophosphate, or 0.2 M sodium carbonate failed to release p64, suggesting that the acylated form of this protein is tightly associated with membranes. Pulse labeling of proteins in quiescent cells with [3H] palmitate and subsequent chasing in medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, fibroblast growth factor, or phorbol dibutyrate revealed that the fatty acid associated with p64 undergoes mitogen-stimulated turnover, whereas turnover of fatty-acid on other acylated proteins is not observed. Palmitate is the predominant fatty acid associated with p64; however, small amounts of covalent myristate are also detected. Both fatty acids are attached post-translationally to p64 through a hydroxylamine-sensitive linkage, suggesting that acylation of this protein is catalyzed by a palmitoyl transferase with relaxed specificity for fatty acid substrates. Together, these results suggest that palmitoylation may participate in the association of p64 with the plasma membrane and that mitogen-dependent deacylation might alter interactions between this protein and other membrane components."
https://openalex.org/W2142436423,"Abstract The primary structure of a soluble form of the CD4 receptor (sCD4) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells has been confirmed by mass spectrometric peptide mapping and and tandem mass spectrometry. These studies corroborated 95% of the 369-amino acid-long sequence and established the fidelity of translation of the NH2 and COOH terminal including the absence of ragged ends. The arrangement of the three disulfide bonds in recombinant sCD4 was also established by mass spectrometry and comparative high performance liquid chromatography mapping and shown to be identical to that expected from previous studies of intrachain disulfide bonding in T4 antigens derived from sheep and mouse. No other arrangements of disulfides were detected. Carbohydrate mapping by mass spectrometry was used to establish that both potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites in sCD4 (Asn271 and Asn300) have oligosaccharides attached. Structural characterization by mass spectrometry and methylation analysis of the heterogeneous family of oligosaccharides at each of the specific attachment sites indicates that the major components of both families of oligosaccharides have the following biantennary structures: (Formula, see text) where m + n = 0-2, and x = 0,1. Minor carbohydrate components having three N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) groups and an additional hexose-hexosamine unit were detected by high performance anion-exchange chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1606674124,"Abstract The interaction of human platelet thrombospondin (TSP) with human platelet glycoproteins GPIIb-IIIa was studied using a solid-phase binding assay. Polystyrene test tubes were coated with TSP, and 125I-labeled GPIIb-IIIa was added, allowed to bind, and the bound radioactivity was measured. After 90 min, the binding became time independent, and in most experiments, more than 10% of the exogenously added radioactivity was bound to the tube. Analysis of the bound radioactivity by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography indicated that it was from labeled GPIIb-IIIa. Several lines of evidence indicate that the binding of GPIIb-IIIa to TSP was specific. (a) TSP immobilized on plastic or Sepharose bound 3-10-fold more GPIIb-IIIa than immobilized bovine serum albumin. (b) Addition of unlabeled excess GPIIb-IIIa reversed the binding of 125I-labeled GPIIb-IIIa to immobilized TSP. (c) Addition of EDTA inhibited the binding of GPIIb-IIIa to TSP by more than 90%, whereas addition of 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2 potentiated the binding by more than 100%. (d) Monoclonal antibodies against TSP and GPIIb-IIIa inhibited the binding by 30-70% as compared with control and polyclonal anti-fibrinogen anti-serum. (e) A plot of GPIIb-IIIa bound versus GPIIb-IIIa added was best described as a rectangular hyperbola by regression analysis with half-saturation at 60 ng/ml GPIIb-IIIa. Similar results were obtained when labeled TSP was added to tubes coated with GPIIb-IIIa. These results show that TSP and GPIIb-IIIa can specifically interact in vitro and suggest that GPIIb-IIIa may function as a platelet TSP receptor during platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1564784842,"Abstract The increase in acid-insoluble collagen (AIC) from tail tendons of streptozotocin-diabetic rats was measured and compared with that for control rats. AIC increased from 10% initially to 75% after 12 weeks of diabetes. It then increased slowly to 85% after 45 weeks. AIC for control rats was constant for the first 12 weeks and then increased slowly to 40% after 45 weeks. These data are consistent with an increase in the number of acid-stable cross-links in the collagen due to diabetes. The quantity of collagen solubilized by pepsin at 4 degrees C was unaltered due to diabetes, strong evidence that formation of diabetes-induced cross-links between helical regions of collagen molecules cannot explain the increase in AIC observed. Non-enzymatic glycation (NEG) increased linearly over 45 weeks, but the rate of NEG was much slower than the rate of increase in AIC observed for diabetics. The level of NEG for diabetics was about three times that for controls at a given time, but there was still less than 1 mol of glucose detected/mol of collagen at near maximum acid insolubility. Fluorescence associated with tail tendons was measured to test the hypothesis that fluorescent cross-links form as a consequence of NEG and result in decreased collagen solubility. Fluorescence (lambda ex 370; lambda em 430) increased slowly with age but was similar for control and diabetic tendons of the same age. Fluorescence was not increased in AIC compared with acid-soluble collagen derived from a given tendon sample. NEG of collagen reached near-diabetic levels in non-diabetic rats whose growth was inhibited by restricted feeding, but there was no associated increase in AIC. These data suggest that NEG and the subsequent formation of fluorescent cross-links do not contribute significantly to the rapid increase in AIC in the streptozotocin-rat model of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1500250259,"The distribution, primary structure, and relative biological activity of neuromedin U has been determined from the frog Rana temporaria. Following sequential column chromatography of a gastrointestinal extract, the peptide was sufficiently pure to enable characterization by micro-sequence analysis. The entire sequence was found to be an icosapentapeptide which displays marked sequence similarity to both porcine and rat neuromedin U. The sequence of the biologically active, COOH-terminal region is almost completely conserved across all species. Synthetic, COOH-terminally amidated amphibian neuromedin U, like the porcine and rat peptides, stimulates rat uterine contraction in vitro thereby fulfilling the criterion upon which the nomenclature of this peptide family is based. In addition, the peptide demonstrates parallel pressor effects when infused systemically into rats. The high degree of amino acid sequence conservation is indicative of strong evolutionary pressure acting to retain the presence of this possibly physiologically important peptide across the vertebrate subphylum."
https://openalex.org/W1529333804,"Numerous reports have described a phosphoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 68-87 kDa, often referred to as the 80K protein, which serves as a major specific substrate for protein kinase C in a wide variety of cell types. This protein has been shown to be myristoylated in macrophages, apparently in a stimulus-dependent manner. In the present study, we have defined the kinetics for myristoylation of the 80K protein in BC3H1 myocytes and have examined the subcellular distribution of the [3H]myristate and 32P-labeled forms of the protein before and after activation of protein kinase C by phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu). The 80K protein was identified in BC3H1 myocytes by apparent molecular mass of 68 kDa (consistent with the previously reported size of the murine homologue), isoelectric point of 4.6-4.8, PDBu-inducible phosphorylation, peptide mapping, and labeling with [3H]myristate. Incorporation of [3H]myristate by this protein occurred through an amide linkage and was abolished completely by cycloheximide. Pulse labeling of quiescent cells with [3H]myristate revealed no alteration in myristoylation of the 80K protein in either the crude membrane or soluble fractions after PDBu-induced phosphorylation. The subcellular distribution of this protein (approximately 80% membrane, approximately 20% cytosol) also was the same in control and PDBu-stimulated cells. Phosphorylation of both the membrane-bound and soluble forms was increased approximately 6-fold upon stimulation of cultures with PDBu; the soluble form was phosphorylated to a 4-fold higher stoichiometry than its membrane-bound counterpart. Together, these data demonstrate that the 80K protein is myristoylated cotranslationally in BC3H1 cells and that protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of the 80K protein does not alter its subcellular distribution or degree of myristoylation. The fact that 20% of total myristoylated 80K protein resides in the cytosol also indicates that myristoylation alone is not sufficient to target this protein to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1482306189,"Using the technique of delayed oligonucleotide migration through polyacrylamide gels, we have demonstrated that cell-free extracts of the human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji contain proteins which can recognize and bind to mismatched single base pairs in short fragments of DNA. One of these binding proteins resembles an activity previously reported in HeLa cells (Jiricny, J., Hughes, M., Corman, N., and Rudkin, B. B. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 8860-8864) and recognizes DNA containing G.T mismatches. Extracts of Raji cells contain an additional activity which recognizes A.C, T.C, or T.T mismatches in DNA. This second binding protein can be distinguished from the G.T binding activity by its size, substrate specificity, and its fractionation properties. In addition to Raji cells, the new mismatch binding protein is present in extracts of human lymphoblastoid cell lines from a normal individual and a xeroderma pigmentosum patient as well as the SV40-transformed human fibroblast cell line MRC5V1. It seems likely that this novel activity is involved in a broad specificity DNA repair pathway for the correction of single base mismatches in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1582922608,"We have characterized the binding of trans-1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-2-methyl-2- propen- 1-one (MDL 27048) to purified procine brain tubulin, and the inhibition of microtubule assembly by this compound in vitro and using cultured cells. Binding measurements were performed by difference absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. MDL 27048 binds to one site/tubulin heterodimer with an apparent equilibrium constant Kb = (2.8 +/- 0.8) X 10(6) M-1 (50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, 1 mM [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM GTP buffer, pH 6.7, at 25 degrees C). Podophyllotoxin displaced the binding of MDL 27048, suggesting an overlap with the colchicine-binding site. Assembly of purified tubulin into microtubules was inhibited by substoichiometric concentrations of MDL 27048, which also induced a slow depolymerization of preassembled microtubules. The cytoplasmic microtubules of PtK2 cells were disrupted in a concentration and time-dependent manner by MDL 27048, as observed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Maximal depolymerization took place with 2 X 10(-6) M MDL 27048 in 3 h. When the inhibitor was washed off from the cells, fast microtubule assembly (approximately 8 min) and complete reorganization of the cytoplasmic microtubule network (15-30 min) were observed. MDL 27048 also induced mitotic arrest in SV40-3T3 cell cultures. Due to all these properties, this anti-tumor drug constitutes a new and potent microtubule inhibitor, characterized by its specificity and reversibility."
https://openalex.org/W1605696021,"Termination of transcription in vitro by purified vaccinia virus RNA polymerase occurs downstream of a cis-acting signal UUUUUNU in the nascent RNA strand and requires a trans-acting termination factor, VTF, that is associated with the viral mRNA capping enzyme. Factor-dependent termination can be inhibited specifically by incorporation of BrUMP (from BrUTP) into nascent RNA in place of UMP. The relevance of VTF action to early vaccinia mRNA biogenesis was demonstrated in the present study of the effects of BrUTP on mRNA synthesis and release by permeabilized vaccinia virions. BrUMP incorporation inhibited the release of newly made transcripts from the virus particle, resulting in the accumulation of transcripts within virus cores. This effect was observed also with IUMP, but not with BrCMP or IMP incorporation. Transcripts synthesized in the presence of BrUTP were heterogeneous in size and severalfold larger than transcripts made in the presence of UTP. The progressive increase in the size of the core-associated, BrUMP-containing transcripts indicated that they were still engaged by elongating RNA polymerase. These results are consistent with a predominant pathway of mRNA 3′-end formation by virions that involves VTF-dependent transcription termination. These data do not support an alternative model of 3′-end formation by endonucleolytic cleavage of larger RNA precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1522697601,"We report here a potentially useful signature of branched DNA structures. The base 5' to the branch and the five bases flanking the 3' side of the branch site are protected from cleavage by DNase I in both three- and four-arm branched DNA molecules. Our procedure is to measure the cleavage profile for each 5' -labeled strand in a control duplex and compare this with that of the same strand in a branched structure under conditions yielding less than one cut per strand. The resulting cleavage pattern in an immobile four-arm junction is roughly 2-fold symmetric, consistent with the pattern of Fe(II).EDTA-induced cleavage that has been observed previously. In the three-arm junction, the DNase I cleavage pattern is asymmetric, indicating lack of 3-fold symmetry. A variable pattern of protection occurs to the 5' side of the branch in some strands only for both three- and four-arm junctions, extending 2-4 residues 5' to the branch."
https://openalex.org/W1556624764,"The broad host range streptococcal plasmid pLS1 encodes for a 5.1-kDa repressor protein, RepA. This protein has affinity for DNA (linear or supercoiled) and is translated from the same mRNA as the replication initiator protein RepB. By gel retardation assays, we observed that RepA shows specificity for binding to the plasmid HinfID fragment, which includes the target of the protein. The target of RepA within the plasmid DNA molecule has been located around the plasmid single site ApaLI. This site is included in a region that contains the promoter for the repA and repB genes and is contiguous to the plasmid ori(+). A complex sequence-directed DNA curvature is observed in this region of pLS1. Upon addition of RepA to plasmid linear DNA or to circularly permuted restriction fragments, this intrinsic curvature was greatly enhanced. Thus, a strong RepA-induced bending could be located in the vicinity of the ApaLI site. Visualization of the bent DNA was achieved by electron microscopy of complexes between RepA and plasmid DNA fragments containing the RepA target."
https://openalex.org/W1578318816,"Abstract This laboratory previously reported that 5-fluorouracil (FUra) increases dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) levels relative to DHFR mRNA levels in a methotrexate-resistant KB cell line; these data suggested that incorporation of FUra into RNA may, in part, lead to cell death through the inhibition of mRNA processing (Will, C. L., and Dolnick, B.J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5433-5436). Utilizing a methotrexate-resistant KB cell line designated 1BT, we now report the kinetic basis for altered levels of DHFR RNA observed in FUra-treated cells. Long-term exposure to FUra had no effect on the steady-state level of DHFR pre-mRNA containing intron V or I. However, steady-state levels of total DHFR mRNA decreased 2.0-fold on a per cell basis in cells exposed to 1.0 microM FUra. No significant change in the half-life of total DHFR mRNA or pre-mRNA was observed in cells exposed to FUra (t1/2 = approximately 11.5 h and 50 min, respectively). Nuclear/cytoplasmic RNA labeling experiments demonstrated that the rate of nuclear DHFR RNA conversion to cytoplasmic DHFR mRNA decreased approximately 1.8-fold in FUra-treated cells. These results provide further evidence the FUra may inhibit processing of mRNA precursors and/or affect the stability of nuclear DHFR mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2028944177,"Abstract Aggregation and autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor-protein kinase, from cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, were studied in the presence of cationic polyamino acids. Poly-L-lysine and poly-L-arginine produced the following effects with the purified receptor: first, the autophosphorylation rate was increased by polycations. Half-maximal stimulation was proportional to polymer length. The rate enhancement was greater at lower ATP concentrations. Second, near-endpoint (equilibrium) autophosphorylation was greater in the presence of the polycations. Polycations inhibited the reverse reaction: ADP + phosphoreceptor yielding ATP + aporeceptor. Third, the [32P]phosphopeptides generated by trypsin digestion of the 32P-beta-subunit, showed that no new autophosphorylation sites resulted from the presence of polycations. Fourth, the polycations, but not insulin, promoted receptor aggregation, and phosphoreceptor aggregated more readily than aporeceptor. Insulin receptor enriched through the wheat germ agglutinin eluate step was compared with purified receptor. Higher concentrations of poly-L-arginine were required to stimulate autophosphorylation and to promote aggregation. Finally, several polycation-dependent substrates present in the wheat germ agglutinin eluate co-aggregated with the insulin receptor. Polycation-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation is linked to a lower KM,app for ATP, but substrate phosphorylation may require the aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1524896367,"Factor IX BM Nagoya (IX Nagoya) is a natural mutant of factor IX responsible for severe hemophilia B. A patient with this mutant is characterized by a markedly prolonged ox brain prothrombin time. IX Nagoya was purified from the patient's plasma by immunoaffinity chromatography with an anti-factor IX monoclonal antibody column. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that treatment of IX Nagoya with factor XIa/Ca2+ resulted in cleavage only at the Arg145-Ala146 bond. Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography of a trypsin digest of IX Nagoya showed an aberrant peptide, which was further digested with proteinase Asp-N. Primary structure analysis of one of the Asp-N peptides revealed that Arg180 is replaced by Trp. An essentially complete (99%) amino acid sequence of IX Nagoya was obtained by sequencing fragments derived from a lysyl endopeptidase digest in which no other substitutions in the catalytic triad or substrate binding site were found. We also found that IX Nagoya is activated by α-chymotrypsin or rat mast cell chymase by monitoring the rate of factor X activation using a fluorogenic peptide substrate in the presence of factor VIII, phospholipids, and Ca2+. These results indicate that the substitution of Arg180 by Trp impairs the cleavage by factor XIa required for activation of this zymogen and that the substitution causes hemophilia BM."
https://openalex.org/W2112660114,"The acid solubility of Type I collagen from rat tail tendons decreases due to diabetes. This finding has been taken as evidence that collagen from diabetics may be more cross-linked than normal. We compared CNBr peptide maps prepared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for [3H] NaBH4-reduced tail tendons from streptozotocin-diabetic rats with maps from age-matched control rats. At least through 30 weeks of diabetes, the distribution of mass of both cross-linked and uncross-linked CNBr peptides was identical in diabetic and control tendons. Therefore, the number of cross-linked peptides did not increase due to diabetes. We analyzed the 3H-cross-linking compounds present on the CNBr peptides and found that the 3H content of peptides cross-linked in control tendons through the bivalent, reduced cross-links hydroxylysinonorleucine and lysinonorleucine was diminished on corresponding peptides from diabetic tendons as a function of duration of diabetes. The cross-linked peptides, however, persisted. Therefore, we conclude that a larger fraction of these bivalent cross-links is found in an unknown, non-reducible form in tendons from diabetic compared with control rats. This resembles a phenomenon normally associated with maturation and/or aging where the non-reducible form of the cross-links is acid-stable. An increase in the fraction of the cross-links that is non-reducible and acid-stable would explain, at least in part, the decrease in acid solubility of the collagen. Non-enzymatic glycation (NEG) was not very specific, since most CNBr peptides bound some glucose. However, peptides from the α2-chain seemed to be preferential targets for NEG. While NEG clearly increased due to diabetes, we found no evidence that increased NEG led to an increased number of cross-links in tail tendon collagen from streptozotocin diabetic rats."
https://openalex.org/W1555873408,"Abstract The two long chain fatty acids common in marine demosponges, (5Z, 9Z)-5,9-hexacosadienoic (delta 5,9-26:2) and (5Z, 9Z, 19Z)-5,9,19-hexacosatrienoic (delta 5,9,19-26:3) acids), were identified also as the major phospholipid components in the freshwater sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis. Whereas the typical marine sponge Microciona prolifera biosynthesizes the delta 5,9,19-26:3 acid solely by homologation of exogenous palmitoleic acid (delta 9-16:1) and subsequent desaturation at positions 5 and 9, it was found that the freshwater sponge could further desaturate the delta 5,9-26:2 acid to the triene, indicating for the first time the existence of delta 19 -desaturase activity in a living organism."
https://openalex.org/W1656770265,"Abstract The homodimeric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis has an unusual spatial arrangement of the subunits (Royer, W.E., Jr., Love, W.E., and Fenderson, F.F. (1985) Nature 316, 277-280). The time course of oxygen and nitric oxide rebinding to this protein following flash photolysis has been measured on a nanosecond time scale. A large amplitude is observed with a half-time of 20 ns (NO). With oxygen the half-time decreases from 70 ns at low fractional photolysis to 30 ns at large breakdown. The second order rate of NO binding is 1.6 x 10(7)/MS, and is the same as that for oxygen. Analysis of the geminate data suggests that oxygen and nitric oxide react more rapidly with the heme than in myoglobin, but also escape much more rapidly from its vicinity."
https://openalex.org/W1527742521,"Abstract A differentiation-competent mouse muscle cell line containing 50-100-times the diploid number of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) genes was used to study regulation of DHFR mRNA levels during myogenic withdrawal from the cell cycle. Quantitative RNase protection assays showed DHFR mRNA levels decreased 15-fold during commitment; DHFR pre-mRNA levels decreased 7-fold. Concomitantly, transcription products were analyzed by hybridization to Southern blots of dhfr-containing plasmids. Control run-on assays performed on nonamplified parental cells indicated that run-on signals measured in amplified cells were dhfr amplicon-specific. Run-on signals were sensitive to alpha-amanitin, indicating RNA polymerase 2 specificity, and did not hybridize to pBR322 sequences, demonstrating hybridization stringency. Comparison of run-on signals hybridizing to DNA fragments representing either the 5' end of the gene or the entire gene showed that transcriptional repression occurred within the first 660 bases of the 30-kilobase gene, consistent with regulation at the level of either initiation or early pretermination. In contrast to the DHFR gene, DNA 5' to all but the first few bases of the DHFR coding region (between -1000 and +60 base pairs from the preferred cap site) showed strong run-on transcription in both proliferative and committed cells. Northern blot analysis using a probe complementary both to the dhfr coding region and the upstream region showed a uniform decrease in all detectable transcripts. No commitment-dependent changes in dhfr cap site usage, splicing, or polyadenylylation site usage were detected. Our results support a transcriptional model for regulation of DHFR mRNA levels."
