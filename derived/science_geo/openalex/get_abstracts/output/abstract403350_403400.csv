https://openalex.org/W2072652550,"Severe behavioural deficits in psychiatric diseases such as autism and schizophrenia have been hypothesized to arise from elevations in the cellular balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) within neural microcircuitry. This hypothesis could unify diverse streams of pathophysiological and genetic evidence, but has not been susceptible to direct testing. Here we design and use several novel optogenetic tools to causally investigate the cellular E/I balance hypothesis in freely moving mammals, and explore the associated circuit physiology. Elevation, but not reduction, of cellular E/I balance within the mouse medial prefrontal cortex was found to elicit a profound impairment in cellular information processing, associated with specific behavioural impairments and increased high-frequency power in the 30-80 Hz range, which have both been observed in clinical conditions in humans. Consistent with the E/I balance hypothesis, compensatory elevation of inhibitory cell excitability partially rescued social deficits caused by E/I balance elevation. These results provide support for the elevated cellular E/I balance hypothesis of severe neuropsychiatric disease-related symptoms."

https://openalex.org/W2003262666,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are the two most common non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Here we sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from 13 DLBCL cases and one FL case to identify genes with mutations in B-cell NHL. We analysed RNA-seq data from these and another 113 NHLs to identify genes with candidate mutations, and then re-sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from these cases to confirm 109 genes with multiple somatic mutations. Genes with roles in histone modification were frequent targets of somatic mutation. For example, 32% of DLBCL and 89% of FL cases had somatic mutations in MLL2, which encodes a histone methyltransferase, and 11.4% and 13.4% of DLBCL and FL cases, respectively, had mutations in MEF2B, a calcium-regulated gene that cooperates with CREBBP and EP300 in acetylating histones. Our analysis suggests a previously unappreciated disruption of chromatin biology in lymphomagenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2029835563,"Plants generate effective responses to infection by recognizing both conserved and variable pathogen-encoded molecules. Pathogens deploy virulence effector proteins into host cells, where they interact physically with host proteins to modulate defense. We generated an interaction network of plant-pathogen effectors from two pathogens spanning the eukaryote-eubacteria divergence, three classes of Arabidopsis immune system proteins, and ~8000 other Arabidopsis proteins. We noted convergence of effectors onto highly interconnected host proteins and indirect, rather than direct, connections between effectors and plant immune receptors. We demonstrated plant immune system functions for 15 of 17 tested host proteins that interact with effectors from both pathogens. Thus, pathogens from different kingdoms deploy independently evolved virulence proteins that interact with a limited set of highly connected cellular hubs to facilitate their diverse life-cycle strategies."

The former can readily undergo one-electron oxidation to give radical cations, whereas the latter are easily reduced to afford radical anions. Here, we report the synthesis of a neutral tricoordinate boron derivative, which acts as a Lewis base and undergoes one-electron oxidation into the corresponding radical cation. These compounds can be regarded as the parent borylene (H-B:) and borinylium (H-B(+.)), respectively, stabilized by two cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes. Ab initio calculations show that the highest occupied molecular orbital of the borane as well as the singly occupied molecular orbital of the radical cation are essentially a pair and a single electron, respectively, in the p(π) orbital of boron."

We isolated bulk quantities of such a molecule by first synthesizing an open-cage C(60) derivative whose opening can be enlarged in situ at 120°C that quantitatively encapsulated one water molecule under the high-pressure conditions. The relatively simple method was developed to close the cage and encapsulate water. The structure of H(2)O@C(60) was determined by single-crystal x-ray analysis, along with its physical and spectroscopic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1976111921,"The magnesium ion, Mg2+, is essential for all life as a cofactor for ATP, polyphosphates such as DNA and RNA, and metabolic enzymes, but whether it plays a part in intracellular signalling (as Ca2+ does) is unknown. Here we identify mutations in the magnesium transporter gene, MAGT1, in a novel X-linked human immunodeficiency characterized by CD4 lymphopenia, severe chronic viral infections, and defective T-lymphocyte activation. We demonstrate that a rapid transient Mg2+ influx is induced by antigen receptor stimulation in normal T cells and by growth factor stimulation in non-lymphoid cells. MAGT1 deficiency abrogates the Mg2+ influx, leading to impaired responses to antigen receptor engagement, including defective activation of phospholipase Cγ1 and a markedly impaired Ca2+ influx in T cells but not B cells. These observations reveal a role for Mg2+ as an intracellular second messenger coupling cell-surface receptor activation to intracellular effectors and identify MAGT1 as a possible target for novel therapeutics. The magnesium ion is the most abundant divalent cation in mammalian cells and is an essential cofactor for ATP, nucleic acids and numerous enzymes in animals and plants. Whether it serves as a second messenger in intracellular signalling — like calcium — has been controversial. New evidence suggests that it does. Li et al. identify mutations in the plasma membrane magnesium transporter MAGT1 in a novel X-linked immunodeficiency, and show that Mg2+ acts as a second messenger in responses triggered by T-cell receptors and EGF receptors. This identifies MAGT1 as a possible target for novel therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1963635975,"The EBI2 receptor (Epstein–Barr virus-induced gene 2, also known as GPR183) was recently shown to be linked to autoimmune disease, and is a critical regulator of the humoral immune response. It is a G-protein-coupled receptor, and its natural ligand has been unknown. Two groups now bring an end to the 'orphan' status of this receptor with identification of specific oxysterols as its natural ligands. The most potent ligand and activator is 7a,25-dihydroxycholesterol, and the EBI2–oxysterol signalling pathway has an important role in the adaptive immune response. Epstein–Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2, also known as GPR183) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is required for humoral immune responses; polymorphisms in the receptor have been associated with inflammatory autoimmune diseases1,2,3. The natural ligand for EBI2 has been unknown. Here we describe the identification of 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (also called 7α,25-OHC or 5-cholesten-3β,7α,25-triol) as a potent and selective agonist of EBI2. Functional activation of human EBI2 by 7α,25-OHC and closely related oxysterols was verified by monitoring second messenger readouts and saturable, high-affinity radioligand binding. Furthermore, we find that 7α,25-OHC and closely related oxysterols act as chemoattractants for immune cells expressing EBI2 by directing cell migration in vitro and in vivo. A critical enzyme required for the generation of 7α,25-OHC is cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H)4. Similar to EBI2 receptor knockout mice, mice deficient in CH25H fail to position activated B cells within the spleen to the outer follicle and mount a reduced plasma cell response after an immune challenge. This demonstrates that CH25H generates EBI2 biological activity in vivo and indicates that the EBI2–oxysterol signalling pathway has an important role in the adaptive immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2043955468,"Many of the cognitive deficits of normal ageing (forgetfulness, distractibility, inflexibility and impaired executive functions) involve prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction. The PFC guides behaviour and thought using working memory, which are essential functions in the information age. Many PFC neurons hold information in working memory through excitatory networks that can maintain persistent neuronal firing in the absence of external stimulation. This fragile process is highly dependent on the neurochemical environment. For example, elevated cyclic-AMP signalling reduces persistent firing by opening HCN and KCNQ potassium channels. It is not known if molecular changes associated with normal ageing alter the physiological properties of PFC neurons during working memory, as there have been no in vivo recordings, to our knowledge, from PFC neurons of aged monkeys. Here we characterize the first recordings of this kind, revealing a marked loss of PFC persistent firing with advancing age that can be rescued by restoring an optimal neurochemical environment. Recordings showed an age-related decline in the firing rate of DELAY neurons, whereas the firing of CUE neurons remained unchanged with age. The memory-related firing of aged DELAY neurons was partially restored to more youthful levels by inhibiting cAMP signalling, or by blocking HCN or KCNQ channels. These findings reveal the cellular basis of age-related cognitive decline in dorsolateral PFC, and demonstrate that physiological integrity can be rescued by addressing the molecular needs of PFC circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2076613851,"The ocean is an important global source of nitrous oxide (N(2)O), a greenhouse gas that contributes to stratospheric ozone destruction. Bacterial nitrification and denitrification are thought to be the primary sources of marine N(2)O, but the isotopic signatures of N(2)O produced by these processes are not consistent with the marine contribution to the global N(2)O budget. Based on enrichment cultures, we report that archaeal ammonia oxidation also produces N(2)O. Natural-abundance stable isotope measurements indicate that the produced N(2)O had bulk δ(15)N and δ(18)O values higher than observed for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria but similar to the δ(15)N and δ(18)O values attributed to the oceanic N(2)O source to the atmosphere. Our results suggest that ammonia-oxidizing archaea may be largely responsible for the oceanic N(2)O source."

https://openalex.org/W1993608941,"Physiological homeostasis is essential for organism survival. Highly responsive neuronal networks are involved, but their constituent neurons are just beginning to be resolved. To query brain serotonergic neurons in homeostasis, we used a neuronal silencing tool, mouse RC::FPDi (based on the synthetic G protein-coupled receptor Di), designed for cell type-specific, ligand-inducible, and reversible suppression of action potential firing. In mice harboring Di-expressing serotonergic neurons, administration of the ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) by systemic injection attenuated the chemoreflex that normally increases respiration in response to tissue carbon dioxide (CO(2)) elevation and acidosis. At the cellular level, CNO suppressed firing rate increases evoked by CO(2) acidosis. Body thermoregulation at room temperature was also disrupted after CNO triggering of Di; core temperatures plummeted, then recovered. This work establishes that serotonergic neurons regulate life-sustaining respiratory and thermoregulatory networks, and demonstrates a noninvasive tool for mapping neuron function."

https://openalex.org/W2096353907,"Physical laws are believed to be invariant under the combined transformations of charge, parity and time reversal (CPT symmetry). This implies that an antimatter particle has exactly the same mass and absolute value of charge as its particle counterpart. Metastable antiprotonic helium ($\bar{p}{\rm He}^+$) is a three-body atom consisting of a normal helium nucleus, an electron in its ground state and an antiproton ($\bar{p}$) occupying a Rydberg state with high principal and angular momentum quantum numbers, respectively $n$ and $\ell$, such that $n\sim\ell\sim 38$. These atoms are amenable to precision laser spectroscopy, the results of which can in principle be used to determine the antiproton-to-electron mass ratio and to constrain the equality between the antiproton and proton charges and masses. Here we report two-photon spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium, in which $\bar{p}{\rm ^3He^+}$ and $\bar{p}{\rm ^4He^+}$ isotopes are irradiated by two counter-propagating laser beams. This excites nonlinear, two-photon transitions of the antiproton of the type $(n,\ell)\rightarrow (n-2,\ell-2)$ at deep-ultraviolet wavelengths ($\lambda$=139.8, 193.0 and 197.0nm), which partly cancel the Doppler broadening of the laser resonance caused by the thermal motion of the atoms. The resulting narrow spectral lines allowed us to measure three transition frequencies with fractional precisions of 2.3-5 parts in $10^9$. By comparing the results with three-body quantum electrodynamics calculations, we derived an antiproton-to-electron mass ratio of 1,836.1526736(23), where the parenthetical error represents one standard deviation. This agrees with the proton-to-electron value known to a similar precision."

https://openalex.org/W2013445415,"Membrane-bound receptors often form large assemblies resulting from binding to soluble ligands, cell-surface molecules on other cells and extracellular matrix proteins. For example, the association of membrane proteins with proteins on different cells (trans-interactions) can drive the oligomerization of proteins on the same cell (cis-interactions). A central problem in understanding the molecular basis of such phenomena is that equilibrium constants are generally measured in three-dimensional solution and are thus difficult to relate to the two-dimensional environment of a membrane surface. Here we present a theoretical treatment that converts three-dimensional affinities to two dimensions, accounting directly for the structure and dynamics of the membrane-bound molecules. Using a multiscale simulation approach, we apply the theory to explain the formation of ordered, junction-like clusters by classical cadherin adhesion proteins. The approach features atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations to determine interdomain flexibility, Monte Carlo simulations of multidomain motion and lattice simulations of junction formation. A finding of general relevance is that changes in interdomain motion on trans-binding have a crucial role in driving the lateral, cis-, clustering of adhesion receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2066346185,"Recent studies suggest that a small subpopulation of malignant cells with stem-like properties is resistant to chemotherapy and may be responsible for the existence of residual cancer after treatment. We have isolated highly tumorigenic cancer cells with 100-fold increase in tumor initiating capacity from the tumor xenografts of human glioblastoma U87 cells in mice. These cells exhibit stem-like properties and show unique energy metabolic characteristics including low mitochondrial respiration, increased glycolysis for ATP generation, and preference for hypoxia to maintain their stemness and tumor forming capacity. Mechanistically, mitochondrial depression in the highly tumorigenic cells occurs mainly at complex II of the electron transport chain with a down-regulation of the succinate dehydrogenase subunit B, leading to deregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors. Under hypoxia, the stem-like cancer cells are resistant to conventional anticancer agents but are sensitive to glycolytic inhibition. Furthermore, combination of glycolytic inhibition with standard therapeutic agents is effective in killing the tumor-initiating cells in vitro and inhibits tumor formation in vivo. Our study suggests that stem-like cancer cells prefer a low oxygen microenvironment and actively utilize the glycolytic pathway for ATP generation. Inhibition of glycolysis may be an effective strategy to eradicate residual cancer stem cells that are otherwise resistant to chemotherapeutic agents in their hypoxic niches."

There is a strong correlation between urbanization and economic development across countries, and within-country evidence suggests that productivity rises in dense agglomerations. But urban economic advantages are often offset by the perennial urban curses of crime, congestion and contagious disease. The past history of the developed world suggests that these problems require more capable governments that use a combination of economic and engineering solutions. Though the scope of urban challenges can make remaining rural seem attractive, agrarian poverty has typically also been quite costly."

We found that mouse hair cells and supporting cells express the immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules nectin-1 and -3, respectively, and that their interaction mediates the heterotypic adhesion between these two cell types. Genetic removal of nectin-1 or -3 disrupted the checkerboard-like pattern, inducing aberrant attachment between hair cells. When cells expressing either nectin-1 or -3 were cocultured, they arranged themselves into a mosaic pattern. Thus, nectin-1 and -3 promote the formation of the checkerboard-like pattern of the auditory epithelia."

https://openalex.org/W2056293703,"Parkinson disease (PD), a prevalent neurodegenerative motor disorder, is characterized by the rather selective loss of dopaminergic neurons and the presence of α-synuclein-enriched Lewy body inclusions in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Although the etiology of PD remains incompletely understood, emerging evidence suggests that dysregulated iron homeostasis may be involved. Notably, nigral dopaminergic neurons are enriched in iron, the uptake of which is facilitated by the divalent metal ion transporter DMT1. To clarify the role of iron in PD, we generated SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing DMT1 either singly or in combination with wild type or mutant α-synuclein. We found that DMT1 overexpression dramatically enhances Fe2+ uptake, which concomitantly promotes cell death. This Fe2+-mediated toxicity is aggravated by the presence of mutant α-synuclein expression, resulting in increased oxidative stress and DNA damage. Curiously, Fe2+-mediated cell death does not appear to involve apoptosis. Instead, the phenomenon seems to occur as a result of excessive autophagic activity. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy reverses cell death mediated by Fe2+ overloading.

Pathologically, it is characterized by selective dopaminergic neuron loss and the presence of Lewy bodies immunoreactive for α-synuclein in the substantia nigra pars compacta. To date, the leading causes for the sporadic form of the disease remain unclear, although there is accumulating evidence implicating oxidative stress (1Sherer T.B. Greenamyre J.T. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 627-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), including the finding that PD brains have increased levels of oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids (2Alam Z.I.

One potential player contributing to increased oxidative stress is iron, which can convert hydrogen peroxide to highly reactive hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction. Indeed, increased deposition of iron was found in microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta of post-mortem PD brains (5Riederer P.

It has been suggested that the tendency of α-synuclein to undergo misfolding and aggregation may underlie its involvement in Lewy body formation and hence PD (15Tan J.M. Wong E.S. Lim K.L. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 2119-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Given that iron increases the propensity of α-synuclein to aggregate (16Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44284-44296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 17Ostrerova-Golts N. Petrucelli L. Hardy J. Lee J.M. Farer M. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6048-6054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate on a synergistic effect between the two. In line with this, there is a growing consensus that the combinatorial effects of environmental and genetic factors may underlie neuronal vulnerability in PD (18Tsang F. Soong T.W. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We therefore used the DMT1 transporter (19Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar) as a genetic tool to overload SH-SY5Y cells to test the role of iron and its interplay with PD-linked genes. We first showed that DMT1 overexpression resulted in increased cell death upon treatment with iron. Next, DMT1 expression coupled with chronic iron treatment and α-synuclein led to increased cell death especially in cells expressing the A53T mutant, and this correlated with increased DNA damage and oxidized proteins. Interestingly, cell death did not appear to be due to apoptosis because activation of caspases was not observed. Instead, there was an increase in autophagy in A53T cells as seen from the increased conversion of LC3-I to -II, greater monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining for autophagolysosomes, and greater numbers of autophagosomes observed with electron microscopy. Finally, treatment with autophagy inhibitors ameliorated cell death resulting from chronic iron treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that autophagy is involved in cell death mediated by the synergistic effects of chronic iron treatment and α-synuclein. cDNAs of DMT1 and α-synuclein (WT, A30P, or A53T) were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA4 expression vectors (Invitrogen), respectively, to generate pcDNA3.1-DMT1-GFP and pcDNA4-α-synuclein (WT, A53T, or A30P). Single stable SH-SY5Y cell lines expressing vector, DMT1, WT α-synuclein, A30P α-synuclein, or A53T α-synuclein plasmids were generated first. The SH-SY5Y double stable cell lines expressing DMT1 and the various α-synucleins were generated by transfecting the DMT1 stable cell line with the desired vector or α-synuclein plasmids. Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, cells were selected by using 800 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) for pcDNA3.1 plasmids or Zeocin (Invitrogen) for pcDNA4 plasmids. Altogether, 10 stable clonal SH-SY5Y cell lines were analyzed and selected for subsequent experiments. These were S-V, S-DMT1, SH-V, SH-WT, SH-A53T, SH-A30P, SD-V, SD-WT, SD-A53T, and SD-A30P, respectively (see supplemental Figs. S1 and S2 for characterization of stable lines). All cell lines were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. 200 μg/ml G418 and/or Zeocin was added to the media to maintain the integrated constructs. The timeline for various experiments using these cells is shown in supplemental Table 1. The tf-LC3 plasmid, which has been described previously (20Kimura S. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar), was used to study the different stages of autophagy. For some assays, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3MA) (5 mm; Sigma) and wortmannin (WM) (200 nm; Sigma) were added to investigate their effect on cell viability. Together with chloroquine (40 μm; Sigma), these agents are known to inhibit autophagy. Cathepsin inhibitors, such as E64D (10 μg/ml; Sigma) and pepstatin A (10 μg/ml; Sigma), were also used. As a positive control for autophagy, cells were starved in amino acid-free Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS; Sigma) for up to 12 h. To assess the iron uptake capability of DMT1, 55Fe uptake assays were performed as described previously (21Zhang L. Lee T. Wang Y. Soong T.W. Biochem.

Briefly, cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM for 1 h to deplete cells of transferrin followed by a first wash with PBS and a second wash in washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 5.5, 25 mm MES, 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 5 mm d-glucose, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 800 μm MgSO4). Subsequently, the cells were maintained in incubation buffer for 30 min at either 37 or 0 °C (nonspecific uptake). The incubation buffer contained washing buffer with 1 μm 55FeCl3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) that had been conjugated with nitriloacetic acid in a 1:20 molar ratio and 50 μm ascorbic acid. After incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold washing buffer and then with PBS. Cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation before solubilizing them with the scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Iron uptake was determined using a Beckman LS6000 scintillation counter. An aliquot of the resuspended cells was kept for determination of total protein using Bradford reagent (Pierce) for quantification of 55Fe incorporation (cpm/μg of protein). Normalized cellular iron uptake was obtained by subtracting the nonspecific iron uptake at 0 °C from the iron uptake at 37 °C. The uptake of iron in the double stable cell lines was determined using a cell-permeable calcein-AM dye (Sigma) as described previously (22Mitchell R.M. Lee S.Y. Randazzo W.T. Simmons Z. Connor J.R. J. Neuroinflammation. 2009; 6: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded at a concentration of 80,000 cells/well into 48-well plates and grown to 80% confluence. The cells were treated with 100 μm FeCl2 in DMEM (pH 5.5) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with DMEM and incubated with 0.25 μm calcein-AM for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed thrice in chilled Hanks' balanced salt solution and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. 150 μl of the lysates were transferred to a 96-well plate, and fluorescence intensity was measured at 488/518 nm. The fluorescence of the lysates was normalized to the protein concentration. For a chronic cellular model of PD, a longitudinal iron treatment paradigm that exposed the stable cell lines to elevated iron for up to 6 days was carried out. Cells were cultured with daily changes of DMEM containing 100 μm FeCl2 for a period lasting up to 6 days. At each time point, total cells (live and dead) were harvested, and a trypan blue exclusion assay was used to determine cell viability (23Das A. Xi L. Kukreja R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12944-12955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Lysis was carried out by disrupting harvested cells in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF in PBS. Ultracentrifugation was carried out at 125,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C (Hitachi Koki, CS150GXL micro-ultracentrifuge). The supernatants and pellet were then collected, and the protein content was quantified by Bradford assay (Pierce). Approximately 50 μg of total protein were resolved on 10–15% SDS-PAGE gels before transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane and detection using ECL reagents (Pierce). The following antibodies were used: anti-α-synuclein, anti-Akt, anti-JNK, anti-phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-cathepsin D and anti-SOD2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-DMT1 (NRAMP24-A) (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX), anti-β-actin, and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit (Sigma). To test for glycosylation of DMT1, deglycosylation was carried out using the N-glycosidase-F deglycosylation kit (Roche Applied Science). The following antibodies were used to investigate specific cell death mechanisms: anti-caspases 3 and 9, anti-cytochrome c, anti-apoptosis-inducing factor (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-LC3B (Abgent). Proteasomal activity was determined using the ubiquitin-proteasome system kit (Chemicon, Billerica, MA). About 15 μg of harvested cell lysates from day 4 of Fe2+ treatment were incubated with the succinyl-LLVY-AMC substrate for 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the amount of AMC released was measured using a fluorometer with a 380/460-nm filter set (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). Cell lysates were prepared as described above after 4 days of Fe2+ treatment. Cellular oxidative stress levels were determined using the OxyBlot Protein Oxidation Detection kit (Chemicon). Briefly, 50 μg of protein were diluted with 6% SDS and incubated with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine for 15 min. The samples were then neutralized before resolving on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferring to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking in 5% milk, membranes were incubated with a rabbit anti-2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for another hour. Finally, the immunocomplexes were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL method. The extent of single and double strand breaks after 4 days of iron treatment was measured using the comet assay procedure described by Low et al. (24Low G.K. Fok E.D. Ting A.P. Hande M.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 2583-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Harvested cells were trypsinized, resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma), mixed with low melting point agarose (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), and spread on Comet slides (Trevigen). Cell lysis was done at 4 °C for 1 h using the buffer provided (Trevigen). To survey both single and double strand breaks, alkaline buffer electrophoresis was carried out for 20 min before neutralization with 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 for 15 min and dehydration in 70% ethanol. Slides were then dried at 37 °C to bring all the cells to a single plane before staining with SYBR Green (Trevigen). 100 comets were randomly captured and analyzed for each slide. A minimum of triplicate sets for each treatment and cell line were carried out. Images were visualized using the 20× objective of a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and scored with Comet Imager 2.2.100 software (Metasystems GmbH, Altlussheim, Germany). Cells grown on coverslips were incubated with 0.05 mm MDC in PBS at 37 °C for 10 min. The dye is a marker for autophagolysosomes (25Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. Agostinis P. Agrawal D.K. Aliev G.

Following incubation, cells were washed four times with PBS and immediately analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using an inverted microscope (Olympus BX51, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a filter system (excitation filter V-2A, 380–420 nm; barrier filter, 450 nm). LSM Zeiss Imaging analysis software was used to measure the fluorescence intensity of MDC-stained cells. Cells were seeded at a density of 500,000 cells/ml and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2 h. They were subsequently postfixed in osmium tetroxide (OsO4) in 0.2 m buffer for 1 h after which they were dehydrated under an increasing ethanol gradient. The samples were embedded in epoxy resin mixture and allowed to polymerize at 60 °C for 48 h. The blocks were ultrasectioned using a diamond knife with the ultramicrotome set to cut at approximately 100 nm using heat advance. The sections were subsequently mounted onto thin bar copper grids. For quantification purposes, a standard stereological approach using the “selector” probe (26Cruz-Orive L.M. J. Microsc. 1987; 145: 121-142PubMed Google Scholar) was used to account for the number of autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes in each field. All statistics were carried out using SPSS (Version 11) or GraphPad Prism (Version 4) software. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the values between two or more groups supported by multiple comparisons. This was followed by the Bonferroni's post hoc test. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 (*). Using DMT1 as a means of overloading Fe2+ into our cellular model, we first demonstrated via the 55Fe uptake assay that S-DMT1 cells stably expressing DMT1 mediated a dramatic 300-fold increase in iron uptake compared with control SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1A). This demonstrated that DMT1 was indeed a viable system for loading iron into the cell. Additionally, treatment with iron resulted in greater cell death in the S-DMT1 stable cell lines compared with the S-V vector cell line after 24 h especially for 10 and 15 mm FeCl2 (Fig. 1, B and C). Next, we examined how chronic iron overload could affect the cell in combination with a genetic component of PD, α-synuclein. With additional α-synuclein expression in combination with DMT1, the double stable SH-SY5Y cell line SD-A53T displayed synergistic toxicity when treated with iron over several days even when using a lower concentration of 100 μm FeCl2. There was an approximately 2-fold decrease in SD-A53T cell viability with Fe2+ treatment compared with SD-V especially from day 4 onward (Fig. 2A). In addition, it can be seen that the cell density was highest for SD-V and SD-WT and lowest for A53T (Fig. 2B). This was in contrast to the α-synuclein cell lines without stable DMT1 expression (SH-V, SH-WT, SH-A53T, and SH-A30P), which showed no significant difference in cell viability or density upon treatment with iron for the same period of time (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). Additionally, the iron quenching assay using calcein-AM showed that upon treatment with iron there was no difference in iron uptake among the α-synuclein-expressing double stable cell lines when compared with the control SD-V cell line (supplemental Fig. S3C). This shows that WT or mutant α-synuclein does not affect iron uptake and suggests that cell death in the SD-A53T double stable cell line is due to the synergistic effect of iron and A53T rather than an A53T-mediated increase in iron uptake.FIGURE 2DMT1-mediated iron uptake enhances toxicity of α-synuclein A53T mutant. A trypan blue assay was performed on the double stable cell lines (SD-V, SD-WT, SD-A53T, and SD-A30P) with 100 μm FeCl2 treatment over 6 days. A, the SD-A53T stable line showed the greatest reduction in cell viability with a significant difference compared with SD-V on days 4, 5, and 6 (*, p < 0.05). Error bars represent standard error of the mean (S.E.). B, the SD-A53T cell line was also most affected in terms of cell density with a plateau in cell proliferation on days 4 and 6 compared with SD-V (*, p < 0.05). All data shown are representative of three independent experiments. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oxidative stress can damage the cell in a number of ways, including the formation of protein carbonyls due to peptide bond cleavage or amino acid oxidation, formation of protein aggregates due to oxidant-induced cysteine cross-linking, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative DNA damage (27Cecarini V. Gee J. Fioretti E. Amici M. Angeletti M. Eleuteri A.M. Keller J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We evaluated the extent to which iron in combination with WT or mutant α-synuclein could affect the level of oxidative stress in cells and found that there was indeed oxidative damage at both protein and DNA levels. After 4 days of treatment with 100 μm FeCl2, the level of oxidized proteins (protein carbonyls) as shown by the oxyblot assay was about 4 times higher for SD-A53T compared with SD-WT and SD-A30P cell lines. In contrast, untreated cells showed very little oxidative damage (Fig. 3A). The increase in oxidized proteins for iron-treated SD-A53T cells suggested that iron treatment coupled with the A53T mutation could raise levels of reactive oxygen species. However, although oxyblot is a sensitive assay for protein carbonyls, it is unable to measure other forms of protein modification by reactive oxygen species, such as the formation of sulfoxide and disulfide bridges from cysteine and methionine and nitrotyrosine from tyrosine residues (27Cecarini V. Gee J. Fioretti E. Amici M. Angeletti M. Eleuteri A.M. Keller J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, it is unable to measure lipid peroxidation or DNA damage. Thus, to obtain a better idea of the level of oxidative stress, we examined oxidative stress-induced DNA damage using the comet assay. After 4 days of iron treatment, it can be seen that there was substantial DNA damage in SD-A53T cells, whereas the SD-V controls displayed minimal damage (Fig. 3B). Quantification of tail moments of the four cell lines (shown as population data) indicated significant differences between treated and untreated cells as well as between WT and mutant α-synuclein (Fig. 3B, right panel). Cell death for SD-A53T and SD-A30P cell lines peaked at day 4 and day 5, respectively, after exposure to 100 μm FeCl2. However, we did not detect any changes in ubiquitin-proteasome system activity between iron-treated and untreated cells on the 4th day (supplemental Fig. S4). This suggested that the proteasome was still functional and capable of clearing damaged proteins. Thus, the cell death seen in SD-A53T and SD-A30P cells was unlikely to be due to proteasomal impairment. To determine whether the cell death was due to apoptosis, we examined cytochrome c release into the cytosol. After 4 days of treatment with 100 μm FeCl2, no cytochrome c was observed in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4A), suggesting that apoptosis did not play a role in iron-mediated SD-A53T cell death. We also studied the possible involvement of caspases and found that cleaved caspase 9 was present but was not up-regulated in the presence of iron (supplemental Fig. S5A). More importantly, iron-treated SD-A53T cells did not show any cleaved caspase 3, which is the final executioner for apoptosis. We also studied another pathway for apoptosis via apoptosis-inducing factor, which plays a role in caspase-independent apoptosis. Apoptosis-inducing factor is released from the mitochondria and migrates into the nucleus, binding to and triggering the destruction of DNA and subsequent cell death. We examined the potential translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor into the nuclear fraction but did not find any evidence of it doing so in the various untreated and treated cell lines (supplemental Fig. S5B). After 4 days of FeCl2 treatment, results from immunoblotting with LC3B antibody suggested that the SD-A53T cells had increased autophagic activity (Fig. 4B). LC3-I is a cytoplasmic protein that when converted to LC3-II becomes incorporated into the double membrane of autophagosomes. Thus, the conversion of LC3-I to -II can be used as a marker for autophagy. NH4Cl was used to inhibit the degradation of LC3-II by the lysosome so that the conversion of LC3-I to -II could be visualized. Thus, it can be seen that for SD-A53T with NH4Cl (Fig. 4B, lane 10) there is a basal level of autophagy. On treatment with iron and NH4Cl (lane 11), the level of LC3-II increased, suggesting an increase in autophagic activity. Treatment with iron but not with NH4Cl showed a drastic reduction of LC3-II, demonstrating that it can indeed be degraded by the lysosome and that the increase in lane 11 was not due to up-regulation of LC3. We next evaluated t"
https://openalex.org/W2072411385,"The complexity of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells evolved to provide distinct environments to regulate processes necessary for cell proliferation and survival. A large family of predicted cation/proton exchangers (CHX), represented by 28 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, are associated with diverse endomembrane compartments and tissues in plants, although their roles are poorly understood. We expressed a phylogenetically related cluster of CHX genes, encoded by CHX15-CHX20, in yeast and bacterial cells engineered to lack multiple cation-handling mechanisms. Of these, CHX16-CHX20 were implicated in pH homeostasis because their expression rescued the alkaline pH-sensitive growth phenotype of the host yeast strain. A smaller subset, CHX17-CHX19, also conferred tolerance to hygromycin B. Further differences were observed in K(+)- and low pH-dependent growth phenotypes. Although CHX17 did not alter cytoplasmic or vacuolar pH in yeast, CHX20 elicited acidification and alkalization of the cytosol and vacuole, respectively. Using heterologous expression in Escherichia coli strains lacking K(+) uptake systems, we provide evidence for K(+) ((86)Rb) transport mediated by CHX17 and CHX20. Finally, we show that CHX17 and CHX20 affected protein sorting as measured by carboxypeptidase Y secretion in yeast mutants grown at alkaline pH. In plant cells, CHX20-RFP co-localized with an endoplasmic reticulum marker, whereas RFP-tagged CHX17-CHX19 co-localized with prevacuolar compartment and endosome markers. Together, these results suggest that in response to environmental cues, multiple CHX transporters differentially modulate K(+) and pH homeostasis of distinct intracellular compartments, which alter membrane trafficking events likely to be critical for adaptation and survival."

https://openalex.org/W2030051678,"Post-transcriptional mechanisms play an important role in the control of inflammatory gene expression. The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology (KH)-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) triggers rapid degradation of mRNAs for various cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammation-related proteins by interacting with AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-untranslated mRNA regions. In addition to destabilizing mRNAs, AU-rich elements can restrict their translation. Evidence that KSRP also participates in translational silencing was obtained in a screen comparing the polysome profiles of cells with siRNA-mediated depletion of KSRP with that of control cells. Among the group of mRNAs showing increased polysome association upon KSRP depletion are those of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1α as well as other ARE-containing transcripts. Redistribution of IL-6 mRNA to polysomes was associated with increased IL-6 protein secretion by the KSRP-depleted cells. Silencing of IL-6 and IL-1α mRNAs depended on their 3'-untranslated regions. The sequence essential for translational control of IL-6 mRNA and its interaction with KSRP was located to an ARE. KSRP-dependent silencing was reversed by IL-1, a strong inducer of IL-6 mRNA and protein expression. The results identify KSRP as a protein involved in ARE-mediated translational silencing. They suggest that KSRP restricts inflammatory gene expression not only by enhancing degradation of mRNAs but also by inhibiting translation, both functions that are counteracted by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1."
https://openalex.org/W2048915992,"Dietary retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives) contribute to normal embryonic development. However, the mechanism(s) involved in the transfer of recently ingested vitamin A from mother to embryo is not fully understood. We investigated in vivo whether lipoprotein lipase (LPL) facilitates the placental uptake of dietary retinyl ester incorporated in chylomicrons and their remnants and its transfer to the embryo. We examined the effects of both genetic ablation (MCK-L0 mice) and pharmacological inhibition (P-407) of LPL by maintaining wild type and MCK-L0 mice on diets with different vitamin A content or administering them an oral gavage dose of [(3)H]retinol with or without P-407 treatment. We showed that LPL expressed in placenta facilitates uptake of retinoids by this organ and their transfer to the embryo, mainly through its catalytic activity. In addition, through its ""bridging function,"" LPL can mediate the acquisition of nascent chylomicrons by the placenta, although less efficiently. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis showed that placental LPL acts in concert with LDL receptor and LRP1. Finally, by knocking out the retinol-binding protein (RBP) gene in the MCK-L0 background (MCK-L0-RBP(-/-) mice) we demonstrated that the placenta acquires dietary retinoids also via the maternal circulating RBP-retinol complex. RBP expressed in the placenta facilitate the transfer of postprandial retinoids across the placental layers toward the embryo."

In this regard, the identification of Cys-3556.47, located next to Trp-3566.48 of the highly conserved CWXP motif, as a binding contact for the C3 alkyl chain of a nonclassical cannabinoid (19Picone R.P.

The finding that Cys-2856.47 of the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) became accessible to a thiol-reactive reagent only when the receptor was activated (20Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol.

Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the hydrophobic pocket that interacts with the C3 alkyl chain of cannabinoids forms dynamically as the receptor shifts its equilibrium toward the active state.

The x-ray structures of GPCRs with diffusible ligands have shown that the location of ligand binding is slightly more extracellular than that of the covalently bound retinal in rhodopsin and that the binding pocket is open or partially open, possibly for easy access of the ligand to the binding cavity (23Cherezov V. Rosenbaum D.M. Hanson M.A. Rasmussen S.G. Thian F.S. Kobilka T.S. Choi H.J. Kuhn P. Weis W.I. Kobilka B.K. Stevens R.C. Science. 2007; 318: 1258-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). In GPCRs, the region formed by the extracellular ends of H2/H3/H7 has been proposed to contain a cleft that forms the minor binding pocket (37Rosenkilde M.M. Benned-Jensen T. Frimurer T.M. Schwartz T.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2010; 31: 567-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the x-ray structure of the A2A receptor (PDB code 3EML) (25Jaakola V.P. Griffith M.T. Hanson M.A. Cherezov V. Chien E.Y. Lane J.R. Ijzerman A.P. Stevens R.C. Science. 2008; 322: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar), the major binding pocket was occupied by an antagonist, whereas the minor binding pocket was occupied by a series of coordinated water molecules. Participating in H-bonding with these is His-2787.43, which is equivalent to Lys-2967.43 in rhodopsin which forms a covalent bond to the cis-retinal ligand. Interestingly, Ser-3837.39 and Cys-3867.42, in close proximity to the 7.43 position, in the CB1 receptor have been reported as residues important for ligand binding (38Fay J.F. Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8757-8769Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 39Kapur A. Hurst D.P. Fleischer D. Whitnell R. Thakur G.A. Makriyannis A. Reggio P.H. Abood M.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1512-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Combining these results with the results of other mutation studies, including Asp-184EC1 (40Murphy J.W. Kendall D.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Phe-1893.25 (40Murphy J.W. Kendall D.A. Biochem.

Abadji V. Kendall D.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the minor binding pocket appears important for the binding of classical and nonclassical cannabinoids. This is supported by the notion that the H2/H3/H6/H7 region of the CB1 receptor is important for classical and nonclassical cannabinoid interactions (39Kapur A. Hurst D.P. Fleischer D. Whitnell R. Thakur G.A. Makriyannis A. Reggio P.H. Abood M.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1512-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 43Shim J.Y. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2010; 10: 779-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The starting point of this study was our observation in the ligand-unbound CB1 receptor model (44Shim J.Y. Rudd J. Ding T.T. Proteins. 2011; 79: 581-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) that a group of water molecules were networked through H-bonding to Ser-1732.60 in the minor binding pocket and extended to Tyr-2755.39 in the major binding pocket. We utilized the minor binding pocket of the CB1 receptor as the primary ligand interaction site to explore HU210 binding within the TM binding pore using lipid bilayer molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We identified residues Phe-1742.61, Phe-1772.64, Leu-1933.29, and Met-3636.55 as being critical for HU210 by mutational analysis and determined essential cannabinoid-binding domains by the MD simulations. Functional data for the mutant receptors demonstrated a diminished potency for G protein activation suggesting that the hydrophobic binding pocket is crucial for binding classical and nonclassical cannabinoids and for G protein coupling.

Participating in H-bonding with these is His-2787.43, which is equivalent to Lys-2967.43 in rhodopsin which forms a covalent bond to the cis-retinal ligand. Interestingly, Ser-3837.39 and Cys-3867.42, in close proximity to the 7.43 position, in the CB1 receptor have been reported as residues important for ligand binding (38Fay J.F. Dunham T.D.

This is supported by the notion that the H2/H3/H6/H7 region of the CB1 receptor is important for classical and nonclassical cannabinoid interactions (39Kapur A. Hurst D.P. Fleischer D. Whitnell R.

Proteins. 2011; 79: 581-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) that a group of water molecules were networked through H-bonding to Ser-1732.60 in the minor binding pocket and extended to Tyr-2755.39 in the major binding pocket. We utilized the minor binding pocket of the CB1 receptor as the primary ligand interaction site to explore HU210 binding within the TM binding pore using lipid bilayer molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We identified residues Phe-1742.61, Phe-1772.64, Leu-1933.29, and Met-3636.55 as being critical for HU210 by mutational analysis and determined essential cannabinoid-binding domains by the MD simulations. Functional data for the mutant receptors demonstrated a diminished potency for G protein activation suggesting that the hydrophobic binding pocket is crucial for binding classical and nonclassical cannabinoids and for G protein coupling."

However, the precise role of AR in prostate cancer development and progression still remains largely unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether overexpression of AR is sufficient to induce prostate tumor formation in vivo. Here, we inserted the human AR transgene with a LoxP-stop-loxP (LSL) cassette into the mouse ROSA26 locus, permitting ""conditionally"" activated AR transgene expression through Cre recombinase-mediated removal of the LSL cassette. By crossing this AR floxed strain with Osr1-Cre (odd skipped related) mice, in which the Osr1 promoter activates at embryonic day 11.5 in urogenital sinus epithelium, we generated a conditional transgenic line, R26hAR(loxP):Osr1-Cre+. Expression of transgenic AR was detected in both prostatic luminal and basal epithelial cells and is resistant to castration. Approximately one-half of the transgenic mice displayed mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) lesions. Intriguingly, four mice (10%) developed prostatic adenocarcinomas, with two demonstrating invasive diseases. Positive immunostaining of transgenic AR protein was observed in the majority of atypical and tumor cells in the mPIN and prostatic adenocarcinomas, providing a link between transgenic AR expression and oncogenic transformation. An increase in Ki67-positive cells appeared in all mPIN and prostatic adenocarcinoma lesions of the mice. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that conditional activation of transgenic AR expression by Osr1 promoter induces prostate tumor formation in mice. This new AR transgenic mouse line mimics the human disease and can be used for study of prostate tumorigenesis and drug development."

Gα is essential for specific signaling and regulates basal activity of GIRK (Ibasal) and kinetics of the response elicited by activation by G protein-coupled receptors (Ievoked). These regulations are believed to occur within a GIRK-Gα-Gβγ signaling complex. Fluorescent energy resonance transfer (FRET) studies showed strong GIRK-Gβγ interactions but yielded controversial results regarding the GIRK-Gαi/o interaction. We investigated the mechanisms of regulation of GIRK by Gαi/o using wild-type Gαi3 (Gαi3WT) and Gαi3 labeled at three different positions with fluorescent proteins, CFP or YFP (xFP). Gαi3xFP proteins bound the cytosolic domain of GIRK1 and interacted with Gβγ in a guanine nucleotide-dependent manner. However, only an N-terminally labeled, myristoylated Gαi3xFP (Gαi3NT) closely mimicked all aspects of Gαi3WT regulation except for a weaker regulation of Ibasal. Gαi3 labeled with YFP within the Gα helical domain preserved regulation of Ibasal but failed to restore fast Ievoked. Titrated expression of Gαi3NT and Gαi3WT confirmed that regulation of Ibasal and of the kinetics of Ievoked of GIRK1/2 are independent functions of Gαi.

Goegel M.C. Behan D.P. Chalmers D.T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). An agonist-bound GPCR initiates GDP-GTP exchange at the Gα subunit, which serves as the “on-off” switch of the GPCR-initiated process and as the trigger for the release of the Gβγ dimer. Both the active GTP-bound Gα subunit (GαGTP) and Gβγ directly interact and regulate various effector molecules such as phospholipase Cβ, adenylyl cyclase, and other enzymes, as well as a number of ion channels (1Oldham W.M.

In particular, the G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channel is the archetypal Gβγ effector activated by direct binding of Gβγ (7Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). GIRK is an important mediator of inhibitory actions of Gi/o-coupled GPCRs, notably the vagal inhibition of cardiac pacing and of the inhibitory actions of a large number of neurotransmitters in the brain (8Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 9Lüscher C. Slesinger P.A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 10Hibino H.

It is becoming clear that GIRK, the prototypical Gβγ effector (11Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), is also an effector of the Gα subunit, which appears to play multiple roles in modulation of GIRK activity. Gαi controls the gating of GIRK by acting as a servo-type regulator, operating both as a damper of persistent inhibitory signaling by reducing the basal activity of GIRK (Ibasal) and, when activated by GPCR, as the generator of the main inhibitory signal, the evoked current of GIRK (Ievoked) (12Peleg S.

Several lines of evidence point to an active modulation of GIRK both by the nonactivated GDP-bound form of Gαi3 (Gαi3GDP) (12Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2807-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This multiprotein complex is believed to enable specific and fast interactions of many protein partners, such as Gαi and GIRK, thus enabling them to modulate one another. However, the composition of such complexes and the roles of individual protein partners are yet to be determined (9Lüscher C. Slesinger P.A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 22Zylbergold P. Ramakrishnan N. Hebert T.E. Channels. 2010; 4: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To assess modes of interactions between Gαi3 and GIRK within the hypothetical signaling complex, spectroscopic approaches appear particularly attractive. Tagging with fluorescent proteins (xFPs; supplemental Fig. S1A) allows both detection of the tagged protein and assessment of its interaction in vivo with other proteins using resonance energy transfer methods, mainly Förster RET (FRET) (23Vogel, S. S., Thaler, C., Koushik, S. V. (2006) Sci. STKE 2006, re2.Google Scholar) or bioluminescence RET (24Hébert T.E. Galés C. Rebois R.V. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 45: 85-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, fusion of xFP to the Gα subunit has proved challenging. Only a handful of positions have been reported to tolerate insertion of xFPs to produce functional Gαi/o proteins (25Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 26Janetopoulos C. Jin T. Devreotes P. Science. 2001; 291: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 27Leaney J.L.

Biol. 2006; 13: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Even when normal function in one or several aspects is reported, it is often debated whether other actions are preserved after xFP tagging (25Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 28Gibson S.K. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Another notable controversy, relevant to the question of GIRK-related signaling complex, pertains to the direct Gαi/o-GIRK interaction in vivo. A measurable bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between GIRK1-GFP and Gαi1-RLuc (fused with luciferase) was interpreted to suggest a stable GIRK-Gαi1 signaling complex, probably within the endoplasmic reticulum (21Rebois R.V. Robitaille M. Galés C. Dupré D.J. Baragli A. Trieu P. Ethier N. Bouvier M. Hébert T.E. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2807-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, no measurable FRET between GIRK2 and Gαo could be detected (20Fowler C.E. Aryal P. Suen K.F. Slesinger P.A. J. Physiol. 2007; 580: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These discrepancies could arise from inadequate functioning of some xFP-fused GIRKs or Gαi and stress the need for their rigorous testing. Here, we investigated the functional coupling between Gαi and GIRK using three distinct Gαi3 constructs (Gαi3xFPs) labeled with cyan or yellow fluorescent proteins (CFP or YFP, respectively). We have found that xFP labeling of Gαi, even at positions widely regarded as producing functional Gα proteins, may impede Gα-effector interactions and regulations. Furthermore, none of the Gαi3xFPs, even the one that best mimicked the effects of Gαi3WT, produced a measurable FRET signal with GIRK1, contrasting the strong FRET between GIRK1 and Gβγ. Taken together with biochemical data, these results suggested that Gαi3 associates with GIRK primarily via Gβγ. Importantly, the use of Gαi3xFPs revealed differential regulation of basal and evoked GIRK activities by Gα, which was confirmed by titrated expression of Gαi3WT. We conclude that control of the basal activity of GIRK and the fast provision of “free” Gβγ for GIRK activation (following GPCR activation) are distinct functions of the Gαi subunit in this signaling cascade. The cDNAs used in this study were obtained or prepared using standard PCR-based procedures. All cDNA constructs were inserted in two vector types as follows: pGEX (for production of GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli) or into high expression oocyte vectors containing 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences of Xenopus β-globin: pGEMHE, or its derivative pGEMHJ, or pBS-MXT. Rat GIRK1 (U01071), mouse GIRK2–1 (U11859), and human Gαi3 (J03198) were used for oocyte expression and as the basis for modifications. The cDNA for GST-G1NC was kindly provided by Craig A. Doupnik, University of South Florida. GST-G1NC was constructed with a His6 linker replacing the transmembrane segment (amino acids 85–184). GST was fused to its N terminus via a 6-amino acid linker (Leu, Val, Pro, Arg, Gly, and Ser). GST-Gαi3 was prepared as described previously (31Rishal I. Keren-Raifman T. Yakubovich D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Slepak V.Z. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). G1NC for in vitro translation was prepared as described previously (16Berlin S. Keren-Raifman T. Castel R. Rubinstein M. Dessauer C.W. Ivanina T. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 6179-6185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); its transmembrane segment (amino acids 85–184) was deleted and replaced by an 8-amino acid linker GSTASGST. GIRK1CFP was created by replacing its stop codon with an XbaI restriction site. The coding sequence of CFP was inserted between the XbaI site and a HindIII site immediately following the stop codon of the CFP. YFP-labeled Gαi3 constructs were obtained or constructed as follows. Gαi3117, where YFP was inserted in the αb-αc loop, with the first Met of YFP placed at position 117 of Gαi3, was kindly provided by Alfred G. Gilman (28Gibson S.K. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Myr-YFP-Gαi3 was designed similarly to Ref. 27Leaney J.L. Benians A. Graves F.M. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28803-28809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, but instead of a 20-amino acid GAP43 palmitoylation signal, it started with a 17-amino acid myristoylation signal derived from the Src protein, as described previously (32Rishal I. Porozov Y. Yakubovich D. Varon D. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16685-16694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), followed by the first Met of CFP or YFP and then by Gαi3 (the stop codon of xFP was removed). Gαi3-CT-YFP was constructed like GIRK1CFP, where the Gα stop codon was removed and XbaI restriction site was added instead. YFP was inserted immediately after the Gαi3 insert and terminated with a stop codon and a HindIII restriction site. PTX-insensitive Gαi3s were created using PCR, by mutating the cysteine at position 351 (4th position from the C terminus) to isoleucine, C351I. Experiments were approved by the Tel Aviv University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (permit no. 11-05-064). Xenopus oocytes were prepared and injected with RNA, as described previously (12Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and incubated for 3–5 days at 20–22 °C in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 62.75 μg/ml penicillin. Whole-cell currents were measured using standard two-electrode voltage clamp procedures at 20–22 °C, in the ND96 (low K+) solution or in a high K+ solutions (24 mm K+, isotonically replacing NaCl in ND96) as described previously (16Berlin S.

When designed, protomer A of pertussis toxin (PTX) was injected into oocytes 2–20 h before current recordings (33Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen.

Data acquisition and analysis were done using pCLAMP (Molecular Devices). Calculation of activation time constant (τact) was done using a standard mono-exponential fit using the Clampfit program of the pCLAMP suite. GST-fused proteins were purified using standard protocols (31Rishal I. Keren-Raifman T. Yakubovich D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Slepak V.Z. Dascal N. J. Biol.

For pulldown experiments, the following procedure was used: Gαi3 (when present) was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in a total volume of 50 ml of high-K+ binding buffer containing 33 μm of either GDP or GTPγS and 0.01% Lubrol (31Rishal I.

Next, Gβ1γ2 was added for another 20 min. The full cytosolic domain of GIRK1 (G1NC) was then added, and the total reaction volume was brought to 300 μl (with binding buffer containing 30 μm GDP or GTPγS), and the incubation was continued for 1 h at room temperature. Then 5 μl were removed and used to measure the loaded protein (“input”). Binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads and elution with 15 mm glutathione were done as described previously (31Rishal I.

The eluted proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Using this procedure, different pulldown experiments were done as follows: 3 μg of purified histidine-tagged Gβ1γ2 was used to pull down 5 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-labeled Gαi3xFP proteins or 5 μl of YFP alone (Fig. 2; no 35S-labeled G1NC was added in this experiment). 3 μg of purified GST-fused G1NC was used to pull down 5 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-labeled Gαi3WT and 5 μl of Gβ1γ2 (Fig. 3). Autoradiograms were obtained by imaging and quantitating the dried gels using PhosphorImager and the software ImageQuaNT (GE Healthcare). Western blots were performed using Gβ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL reagents from Pierce.FIGURE 3YFP-labeled Gαi3 proteins bind GIRK1 but appear deficient in a triple GIRK1-Gα-Gβγ interaction test. A, pulldown of in vitro translated, 35S-labeled Gαi3WT and Gβ1γ2 by purified GST-fused full cytosolic domain of GIRK1, GST-G1NC. Upper and middle panels show representative autoradiograms of bound and added 35S-labeled proteins, respectively (binding and input as in Fig. 2). The lower panel shows Coomassie staining of the added proteins. GST-G1NC appears as two bands, with upper band corresponding to the correct calculated molecular size (∼72 kDa). GST-G1NC, but not GST, binds Gαi3WT or Gβ1γ2, no matter the nucleotide added (GDP or GTPγS). B, summary of binding of Gαi3WT and Gβ1γ2 by GST-G1NC, expressed in % of input. C, purified Gβ1γ2 enhances the binding of 35S-labeled Gαi3WT to GST-G1NC in the presence of GDP. Pulldown was done using glutathione-Sepharose, with GST alone as negative control. Similar result was observed in the presence of GTPγS (see summary in E). D, representative experiment showing the binding of 35S-labeled ivt Gαi3xFP proteins to GST-G1NC, in the absence or presence of purified Gβ1γ2. E, summary of the effect of Gβ1γ2 on the interaction between G1NC and 35S-labeled ivt Gαi3xFP from four to nine independent experiments. In GDP, Gβ1γ2 significantly enhances the interaction between G1NC and all 35S-labeled ivt Gαi3xFP (top), but it fails to do so in GTPγS (bottom). n.s., nonsignificant. F, Gαi3 does not enhance interaction between His6Gβ1γ2 and 35S-labeled ivt G1NC (representative experiment, out of two). His6Gβ1γ2 (3 μg) pulls down ivt G1NC in the absence or presence of two different amounts of purified GST-Gαi3WT. Upper and middle panels show binding and 1/60 input of ivt G1NC, respectively. The lower panel shows Western blot of His6Gβ1γ2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fluorescent signals were collected with the Zeiss 510 META confocal microscope. Immunolabeling of GIRK1 in giant excised PM patches was done using GIRK1 antibody as described previously (12Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N.

In brief, the vitelline membrane was peeled off, and the oocytes were placed on glass coverslips. After sticking to the coverslip, the oocyte was removed; pieces of membranes attached to the coverslip, with their cytosolic leaflet surface exposed to the external solution, were washed and fixated, and nonspecific sites were blocked with donkey immunoglobulin G (IgG, whole molecule, 1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch), and coverslips were incubated with GIRK1 antibody (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem), followed by incubation with secondary antibody (CY3 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, 1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch). The CY3 fluorescence was imaged by exciting the dye at 514 nm; the emitted light was collected between 540 and 615 nm using the spectral mode of the Zeiss 510 Meta (beam splitter HFT 405/514/633). Intact oocytes were imaged in ND96 solution in a 0.7-mm glass-bottom dish, as described previously (16Berlin S. Keren-Raifman T. Castel R. Rubinstein M. Dessauer C.W. Ivanina T. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 6179-6185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fluorescent signals were collected from circular regions of interest of ∼75 pixels in the membrane area, close to the midline of the animal hemisphere, and from three background regions of interest outside the oocyte using a 20× air objective. CFP was excited using a 405 nm laser line, and emission spectrum was collected using the META detector. Peak emission (481–492-nm band) was chosen for the comparison of expression levels of CFP-labeled proteins. YFP was excited using a 514 nm, and peak emission (524–535 nm) was used for comparison of expression levels. FRET experiments were performed as described previously (16Berlin S. Keren-Raifman T.

J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8167-8175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two spectra were collected from the animal hemisphere of each oocyte, with 405-nm (CFP excitation) and 514-nm (YFP excitation) laser lines. Net FRET signal of the CFP/YFP labeled channels was calculated in the YFP emission range (with the 405 nm excitation) by consecutive subtraction of a scaled CFP-only spectrum (giving the A ratio parameter) and then of the ratio A0, which report the direct excitation of YFP by the 405 nm laser, as in Equations 1 and 2, RatioA=F405/F514=Fdirect/F514+FFRET/F514(Eq. 1) (A-A0)=FFRET/F514(Eq. 2) Because of the use of different experimental settings in independent experiments, the fluorescence intensities cannot be used to construct FRET titration curves. We imaged a doubly-labeled protein expressing both CFP and YFP at a 1:1 stoichiometry (YFP-IRK1-CFP, DL-IRK1(16Berlin S. Keren-Raifman T. Castel R. Rubinstein M. Dessauer C.W. Ivanina T. Dascal N. J.

This was achieved by calculating the slope of the CFP to YFP fluorescence of DL-IRK1. Then this slope was used as a reference to convert CFP and YFP fluorescence, in the other groups of the same experiment, into a molar ratio, which can be collected and used from many experiments and implemented into one titration curve. Calculation of Eapp and distances between fluorophores was done as described previously (36Bykova E.A. Zhang X.D. Chen T.Y. Zheng J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1115-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Zheng, J., Zagotta, W. N. (2003) Science's STKE 2003, PL7.Google Scholar). Results are shown as mean ± S.E. Multiple group comparison was done using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey all-pairwise analysis. Two group comparisons were done using two-tailed t test or paired t test when applicable. Correlations between two parameters were examined using Spearman test. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. To address GIRK-Gαi interactions in vivo using optical methods, we constructed xFP-labeled GIRK1 and Gαi3 and compared with their wild-type counterparts. Functional tests were done in Xenopus oocytes, where the regulation of GIRK by GPCRs, Gβγ, and Gα has been extensively characterized. GIRK currents were recorded under voltage clamp at −80 mV. The neuronal GIRK1/2 (heterotetramer composed of GIRK1 and GIRK2 subunits) shows a sizeable basal activity (Ibasal), especially at high levels of channel expression, presumably because of excess of associated Gβγ and/or lack of sufficient channel-associated Gαi/o (32Rishal I. Porozov Y. Yakubovich D. Varon D. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16685-16694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Ibasal is revealed by exchanging a physiological, low-K+ (ND96; 2 mm) solution to a high-K+ (“hK”; 24 mm) solution (Fig. 1A). When coexpressed with the muscarinic receptor 2 (m2R), GIRK is readily responsive to activation by agonist (acetylcholine; ACh). In the absence of coexpressed Gα, the ACh-evoked current (Ievoked or IACh) reports the activation of endogenous Gαi/o of the oocyte (Fig. 1A, left panel) (38Dascal N. Schreibmayer W. Lim N.F. Wang W. Chavkin C. DiMagno L. Labarca C. Kieffer B.L. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Trollinger D. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 10235-10239Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Ibasal is largely Gβγ-dependent and is strongly sensitive to coexpressed Gαi/o, which reduces Ibasal in a dose-dependent manner and concomitantly increases Ievoked, thereby increasing the ratio of activation, Ra (Ra = Itotal/Ibasal, where Itotal = Ibasal + Ievoked) (Fig. 1, A–C). The reduction in Ibasal is a function of GαiGDP and reflects the formation of Gαβγ heterotrimers, which predisposes (“primes”) the channel for subsequent activation by the GPCR (12Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 39Rubinstein M. Peleg S. Berlin S. Brass D. Dascal N. J. Physiol. 2007; 581: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Among several Gαi/o subunits tested, we have chosen Gαi3 as the preferred donor of Gβγ and regulator of Ibasal. Coexpressed Gαi3 provides for fast kinetics of agonist response (Figs. 1A, inset, and 4), accelerating its time constant (τact) compared with endogenous Gαi/o (40Ivanina T. Varon D. Peleg S.

Arkadia is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets these negative regulators for degradation to enhance TGF-β signaling. In the present study we identified a candidate human tumor suppressor gene product RB1CC1/FIP200 as a novel positive regulator of TGF-β signaling that functions as a substrate-selective cofactor of Arkadia. Overexpression of RB1CC1 enhanced TGF-β signaling, and knockdown of endogenous RB1CC1 attenuated TGF-β-induced expression of target genes as well as TGF-β-induced cytostasis. RB1CC1 down-regulated the protein levels of c-Ski but not SnoN by enhancing the activity of Arkadia E3 ligase toward c-Ski. Substrate selectivity is primarily attributable to the physical interaction of RB1CC1 with substrates, suggesting its role as a scaffold protein.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates various cellular responses, including growth, motility, differentiation, and apoptosis in a wide variety of target cells. TGF-β binds to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, type I and II, and induces the formation of heterotetrameric complexes consisting of two type II receptors and two type I receptors on the cell surface (1Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 2Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4294) Google Scholar, 3Shi Y.

Type II receptor kinase, which is constitutively active, phosphorylates type I receptor kinase in the glycine/serine-rich domain (GS domain) and activates it. Type I receptor kinase then predominantly transmits signals through a group of cytoplasmic signaling mediators termed Smads. Smad2 and Smad3, which are TGF-β-specific receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), are phosphorylated by type I receptor and form a complex with Smad4, a common Smad. The Smad complexes then translocate into the nucleus (4Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3348) Google Scholar) where they regulate transcription of target genes in cooperation with transcriptional activators and/or repressors (5Miyazawa K. Shinozaki M. Hara T. Furuya T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1191-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling is regulated by various cytoplasmic as well as nuclear proteins through physical interactions and posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, SUMOylation, and acetylation. Smad7, an inhibitory Smad, competitively inhibits R-Smad phosphorylation by binding to activated type I receptor (6Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W.

Subcellular fractionation of HEK293 and HaCaT cells was performed using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection of DNA was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cell lysates were prepared in Igepal CA630 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA630, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 units/ml aprotinin). Radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton-X100, and protease inhibitors (P8340, Sigma) was also used in some experiments to detect endogenous protein expression. After centrifugation, protein concentrations of cell lysates were quantified using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). For some experiments, cells were treated with 10 μm lactacystin (Kyowa Medex, Tokyo, Japan) for 6 h or 50 μm MG132 (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) for 4 h before harvesting to inhibit proteasomal degradation. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates and antibodies were incubated between 2 h and overnight. Immune complexes were then precipitated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads or Dynabeads-M280 sheep anti-mouse IgG (Dynal/Invitrogen) and washed four times with lysis buffer. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described (39Koinuma D. Tsutsumi S. Kamimura N. Taniguchi H. Miyazawa K. Sunamura M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Aburatani H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Stripping and re-probing of blotted membranes were performed using stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 0.8% 2-mercaptoethanol; for transfection experiments) or Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce; for endogenous proteins). We used ImageJ software to quantify immunoblot data. All quantification data were obtained from the image files acquired using an LAS-3000 mini luminoimage analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Anti-RB1CC1 antibody was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with human RB1CC1 (amino acid residues 1247–1396) expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Anti-Arkadia antibody (#62) was raised against mouse Arkadia (amino acid residues 1–203) as described previously (24Koinuma D. Shinozaki M. Komuro A. Goto K. Saitoh M. Hanyu A. Ebina M. Nukiwa T. Miyazawa K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6458-6470Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and used for immunoblotting. Commercially available antibodies used were as follows: mouse anti-FLAG (M2) (Sigma), anti-α-tubulin (DM1A) (Sigma), goat anti-Smad6/7 (N19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Arkadia (H16) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; for immunoprecipitation), rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2 (138D4, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-Axin1 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-histone deacetylase 1 (Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), anti-SnoN (H-317) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-HA (Invivogen, San Diego, CA), anti-c-Ski (G8) (Cascade Bioscience, Winchester, MA), anti-RNF111 (Arkadia) (Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan; for immunoblotting of human Arkadia), and anti-myc (9E10) (BD Pharmingen). Normal mouse IgG1 (MB002) (R&D Systems), normal goat IgG (500-G00) (Peprotech, London, UK), and normal rabbit serum (S-5000) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were used as controls. The C-terminal region of RB1CC1 (amino acid residues 1397–1594) was expressed as a fusion protein with GST. Arkadia or c-Ski was expressed using TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI). The pulldown assay was performed as described previously (40Ikushima H. Komuro A. Isogaya K. Shinozaki M. Hellman U. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2955-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A luciferase reporter assay was performed as described previously with only minor changes (24Koinuma D. Shinozaki M. Komuro A. Goto K. Saitoh M. Hanyu A. Ebina M. Nukiwa T. Miyazawa K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6458-6470Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For normalization, pGL4.75-SV40-hRluc was used. (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc2 was derived from (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc (41Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar) by replacing the plasmid backbone from pGL3 to pGL4. Stealth small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from Invitrogen as follows: human Arkadia (sense, 5′-GCAGAGGAAGAAACGAGAAGUGUUA-3′), RB1CC1 #1 (sense, 5′-CCUGGACCAGAUGAUUGCUAGCUGU-3′), RB1CC1 #2 (5′-CCGAGUUAAUUAGUAGACAUGAAGA-3′), Axin1 (sense, 5′-GGCAGCUACAGAUACUACUUCAAGA-3′), Smad7 (sense, 5′-AGAAGAAGUUGGGAAUCUGAAAGCC-3′), and control oligos (12935–112, sequence not available). siRNAs were introduced into HEK293, HEK293T, or COS7 cells using Lipofectamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 100–120 pmol of siRNA/well of 6-well tissue culture plates. For transfection of siRNAs into HaCaT cells, Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) was used. Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized using PrimeScript reverse transcriptase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and oligo(dT)12–18 primers (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG with ROX (Invitrogen) and the ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Detected signals were confirmed as specific by a dissociation protocol. Primers used for quantitative real-time PCR were as follows: human p21WAF (sense, 5′-CGGCAGACCAGCATGACAGA-3′; antisense, 5′-GAAGATCAGCCGGCGTTTG-3′); p15INK4b (sense, 5′-GGTAATGAAGCTGAGCCCAGGT-3′; antisense, 5′-GATAATCCACCGTTGGCCGTA-3′); PAI-1 (sense, 5′-GGCTGACTTCACGAGTCTTTCA-3′; antisense, 5′-ATGCGGGCTGAGACTATGACA-3′); Smad7 (sense, 5′-GATACCCGATGGATTTTCTC-3′; antisense 5′-CTCCAGAAGAAGTTGGGAAT-3′); SnoN (sense, 5′-TACTGGGCATACTTCCATTC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGAAGTACGCTACCATTTTG-3′); c-Ski (sense, 5′-CGACTATGGCAACAAGTACA-3′; antisense, 5′-CTGTTTTGGGTCTTATGGAG-3′); GAPDH (sense, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′; antisense, 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′). Cells were seeded at a density of 2.0 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and transfected with siRNAs. Two days after transfection cells were stimulated by the addition of TGF-β into the medium containing 0.1% FBS. Thirty-six hours later cells were labeled with 0.6 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h. Radioactive DNA in the cells was precipitated using 5% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized with 1 n NaOH and quantified using liquid scintillation counting. Twenty-four hours after transfection, COS7 cells were starved in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM for 3.5 h, labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min, and chased in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm methionine, and 0.5 mm cysteine. For the quantitative real-time-PCR experiments, luciferase reporter assays, and the thymidine incorporation assay, results are expressed as the means. Error bars represent the S.D. The Tukey-Kramer test of R program was used for multiple comparisons of data. p values of less than 0.01 were considered to indicate significance of the experiment. Arkadia is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that enhances TGF-β family signaling by targeting Smad7, c-Ski, and SnoN (24Koinuma D. Shinozaki M. Komuro A. Goto K. Saitoh M. Hanyu A. Ebina M. Nukiwa T.

To identify novel substrates or regulators of Arkadia, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening of a human lung cDNA library using full-length Arkadia as bait. We isolated 342 positive clones from 1.6 × 106 transformants. Among the positive clones, we identified four encoding partial sequences of RB1CC1, a protein with 1594 amino acid residues (37Chano T. Ikegawa S. Kontani K. Okabe H. Baldini N. Saeki Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1295-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 42Ueda H. Abbi S. Zheng C. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that is widely expressed among various tissues and cell lines (supplemental Fig. S1). The clones encoded amino acid residues 1384–1594 or 1220–1594 of RB1CC1 (Fig. 1A). Physical interaction of full-length RB1CC1 with Arkadia was confirmed in HEK293T cells exogenously expressing differently tagged proteins (Fig. 1B). Co-precipitation of Arkadia with RB1CC1 was comparable to that with Smad7. Immunocytochemical analyses have previously revealed that RB1CC1 is located in the cytoplasm (42Ueda H. Abbi S. Zheng C. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or in the nucleus (43Chano T. Kontani K. Teramoto K. Okabe H. Ikegawa S. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We conducted subcellular fractionation of HEK293 cells as well as HaCaT cells and examined the distribution of endogenous Arkadia and RB1CC1. Arkadia was found to be located primarily in the nucleus (31Mizutani A. Saitoh M. Imamura T. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. J. Biochem. 2010; 148: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, RB1CC1 was predominantly observed in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus (Fig. 1C). We then examined the interaction of endogenous Arkadia and RB1CC1 and detected RB1CC1 in the immunoprecipitates obtained using an anti-Arkadia antibody (Fig. 1D). We thus identified RB1CC1 as a novel binding protein of Arkadia. We confirmed their direct interaction using bacterially expressed RB1CC1 (amino acid residues 1397–1594) and in vitro translated Arkadia (Fig. 1E). We also observed that the localization as well as the interaction of RB1CC1 and Arkadia was not affected by TGF-β signaling (data not shown). To determine the Arkadia binding region in RB1CC1, we constructed a series of C-terminal-truncated mutants of RB1CC1 (Fig. 2A) and examined their interaction with Arkadia (Fig. 2B). An RB1CC1 mutant lacking residues 1397–1594 failed to interact with Arkadia, suggesting that this region is essential for the binding. This finding together with the observation that a C-terminal fragment of RB1CC1 (residues 1384–1594) interacted with Arkadia in the yeast two-hybrid system indicates that the C-terminal region of RB1CC1 is necessary and sufficient for interaction with Arkadia. We next mapped the RB1CC1 binding region in Arkadia. For this, we divided Arkadia into small units (Fig. 2C) and examined their interactions with RB1CC1. The C-terminal region (residues 772–936) of Arkadia was found to interact with RB1CC1 (Fig. 2D). Because Arkadia interacts with its substrates through this region (28Nagano Y. Mavrakis K.J. Lee K.L. Fujii T. Koinuma D. Sase H. Yuki K. Isogaya K. Saitoh M. Imamura T. Episkopou V. Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20492-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we examined whether RB1CC1 is a substrate of Arkadia E3 ubiquitin ligase. We did not detect significant ubiquitylation of RB1CC1 by Arkadia (data not shown), suggesting that RB1CC1 is not a substrate but may be a cofactor of Arkadia. We, therefore, examined the possibility that RB1CC1 affects TGF-β signaling. The effect of RB1CC1 on TGF-β signaling was examined using luciferase reporter assays. Overexpression of RB1CC1 enhanced transactivation of a TGF-β-responsive luciferase reporter (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc2 induced by a constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (ALK-5-TD) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, when RB1CC1 was co-expressed with Arkadia, luciferase reporter activity was synergistically increased (Fig. 3A). To examine whether endogenous RB1CC1 exhibits positive effects on TGF-β signaling, we knocked down RB1CC1 in HEK293 cells by transfecting siRNA duplex (Fig. 3B). Knockdown of endogenous RB1CC1 resulted in decreased transactivation of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc2 induced by TGF-β (Fig. 3C). We also examined the effects of RB1CC1 knockdown in HaCaT cells on cellular responses induced by TGF-β. Induction of genes, including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), Smad7, p21WAF, p15INK4b, and SnoN, by TGF-β was reduced, whereas the basal expression levels of these genes were minimally affected (Fig. 3D). TGF-β-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis was also attenuated by knockdown of RB1CC1 (Fig. 3E). These findings suggest that endogenous RB1CC1 functions as a positive regulator of TGF-β signaling. We next determined the region of RB1CC1 required for the enhancement of TGF-β signaling using the C-terminal-truncated mutants. We found that a mutant lacking residues 1397–1594 failed to enhance TGF-β-induced reporter activity of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc2 (Fig. 3F), indicating that the C-terminal region is required for the interaction with Arkadia and also for enhancing TGF-β signaling. Because the C-terminal region of RB1CC1 appears to contain no conserved functional motifs, it was anticipated that the interaction with Arkadia is important for enhancing TGF-β signaling by RB1CC1. Consistently, the enhancement of TGF-β signaling by RB1CC1 was considerably attenuated when Arkadia was knocked down (Fig. 3G). To examine the role of RB1CC1 in regulation of Arkadia function, we knocked down endogenous RB1CC1 and measured the resulting protein expression of Arkadia substrates i.e. Smad7, c-Ski, and SnoN in HaCaT cells (Fig. 4A). As references, Arkadia and Axin1, another cofactor of Arkadia (36Liu W. Rui H. Wang J. Lin S. He Y. Chen M. Li Q. Ye Z. Zhang S. Chan S.C. Chen Y.G. Han J. Lin S.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1646-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), were also knocked down. Smad7 expression was weakly induced in response to TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3, and Ref. 7Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Although knockdown of RB1CC1 attenuated the induction of Smad7 mRNA (Fig. 3D), Smad7 protein expression was enhanced by RB1CC1 knockdown (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–6). Endogenous RB1CC1 thus appears to down-regulate Smad7 protein. Up-regulation of Smad7 protein was also observed after knockdown of Arkadia (lanes 7–9) or Axin1 (lanes 10 and 11). When HaCaT cells were cultured in the presence of A44-03, an inhibitor of TGF-β type I receptor kinase, protein expression of c-Ski and SnoN was significantly up-regulated (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). Endogenous TGF-β signaling thus appears to down-regulate c-Ski and SnoN under the culture condition used in this study, which is consistent with a previous report stating that c-Ski and SnoN proteins are down-regulated in response to TGF-β (44Sun Y. Liu X. Ng-Eaton E. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 12442-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the presence of A44-03, c-Ski accumulated after the"
https://openalex.org/W2008048594,"The enzymatic degradation of plant polysaccharides is emerging as one of the key environmental goals of the early 21st century, impacting on many processes in the textile and detergent industries as well as biomass conversion to biofuels. One of the well known problems with the use of nonstarch (nonfood)-based substrates such as the plant cell wall is that the cellulose fibers are embedded in a network of diverse polysaccharides, including xyloglucan, that renders access difficult. There is therefore increasing interest in the ""accessory enzymes,"" including xyloglucanases, that may aid biomass degradation through removal of ""hemicellulose"" polysaccharides. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of the endo-β-1,4-(xylo)glucan hydrolase from Paenibacillus polymyxa with polymeric, oligomeric, and defined chromogenic aryl-oligosaccharide substrates. The enzyme displays an unusual specificity on defined xyloglucan oligosaccharides, cleaving the XXXG-XXXG repeat into XXX and GXXXG. Kinetic analysis on defined oligosaccharides and on aryl-glycosides suggests that both the -4 and +1 subsites show discrimination against xylose-appended glucosides. The three-dimensional structures of PpXG44 have been solved both in apo-form and as a series of ligand complexes that map the -3 to -1 and +1 to +5 subsites of the extended ligand binding cleft. Complex structures are consistent with partial intolerance of xylosides in the -4' subsites. The atypical specificity of PpXG44 may thus find use in industrial processes involving xyloglucan degradation, such as biomass conversion, or in the emerging exciting applications of defined xyloglucans in food, pharmaceuticals, and cellulose fiber modification."

We previously reported that Smad1 transcriptionally regulates the expression of extracellular matrix in DN. Phenotypic change in mesangial cells (MCs) is a key pathologic event in the progression of DN. The aim of this study is to investigate a novel mechanism underlying chondrogenic phenotypic change in MCs that results in the development of DN. MCs showed chondrogenic potential in a micromass culture, and BMP4 induced the expression of chondrocyte markers (SRY-related HMG Box 9 (SOX9) and type II collagen (COL2)). Advanced glycation end products induced the expression of chondrocyte marker proteins downstream from the BMP4-Smad1 signaling pathway in MCs. In addition, hypoxia also induced the expression of BMP4, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and chondrocyte markers. Overexpression of SOX9 caused ectopic expression of proteoglycans and COL2 in MCs. Furthermore, forced expression of Smad1 induced chondrocyte markers as well. Dorsomorphin inhibited these inductions. Glomerular expressions of HIF-1α, BMP4, and chondrocyte markers were observed in diabetic nephropathy mice. These positive stainings were observed in mesangial sclerotic lesions. SOX9 was partially colocalized with HIF-1α and BMP4 in diabetic glomeruli. BMP4 knock-in transgenic mice showed not only similar pathological lesions to DN, but also the induction of chondrocyte markers in the sclerotic lesions. Here we demonstrate that HIF-1α and BMP4 induce SOX9 expression and subsequent chondrogenic phenotype change in DN.

The characteristic glomerular changes resulting from DN are thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and expansion of the mesangial area caused by increased mesangial extracellular matrix (ECM). Mesangial cells (MCs) are the major source of ECM synthesis in diabetic glomeruli (1Lenz O. Striker L.J. Jacot T.A. Elliot S.J. Killen P.D. Striker G.E. J. Am. Soc.

Hyperglycemia, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) are implicated in the progression of DN by stimulating ECM production in MCs (4Abe H. Matsubara T.

In addition, the phenotypic modulation and dedifferentiation of MCs, which are derived from mesenchymal cells, are key pathological events (7Makino H. Kashihara N. Sugiyama H. Kanao K. Sekikawa T.

MCs acquired phenotypes not only of activated smooth muscle cells but also of fibroblasts, and subsequently secrete excess ECM proteins.We previously reported that Smad1 is a direct transcriptional regulator of type IV collagen (COL4), a major component of increased mesangial ECM in DN, as well as other ECM proteins such as type I collagen (COL1), osteopontin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (4Abe H.

The most critical feature of glomerulosclerosis is mesangial expansion, which is strongly correlated with decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (10Mauer S.M. Steffes M.W. Ellis E.N.

Most importantly, we found that the glomerular expression levels of Smad1 are clearly correlated with the severities of mesangial matrix expansion in rodent DN (9Matsubara T. Abe H. Arai H. Nagai K.

However, we still lack mechanistic insight into how Smad1 is involved in phenotypic alteration of MCs and in the irreversible progression of DN. It is generally acknowledged that Smad1 transduces TGF-β signals and also transduces BMP signals through its receptors (12Chen W. Fu X. Sheng Z. Chin. Med. J. 2002; 115: 446-450PubMed Google Scholar, 13Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). Although impairment of vascular wall integrity caused by mesangial matrix expansion leads to irreversible glomerulosclerosis, the molecular mechanisms underlying this irreversible change in the phenotypes of MCs in advanced DN are still unknown. We also demonstrated previously that a transcription factor, SRY-related HMG Box 9 (SOX9), is involved in the modulation of transcriptional enhancement of COL4 (14Sumi E. Iehara N. Akiyama H.

Chaboissier M.C. Martin J.F. Schedl A. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2813-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). Moreover, SOX9 is responsible for the deposition of ECM, which is composed predominantly of type II collagen (COL2) in chondrocytes (16Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). Precise regulation of both induction and silencing of SOX9 is required for the normal development of chondrocytes. Conversely, inappropriate or reactivated expression of SOX9 was reported to impair cell phenotype and promote ECM deposition in vascular diseases and fibrosis (17Farrington-Rock C. Crofts N.J.

Among the many signaling molecules involved in chondrogenesis, the biological significance of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) has been well established by utilizing pluripotent C3H10T1/2 cells as a model for the initial events of mesenchymal chondrogenesis (21Ahrens M. Ankenbauer T. Schröder D. Hollnagel A. Mayer H. Gross G. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).We hypothesized that BMP4 and SOX9 would be closely linked to the phenotypic alteration of MCs and to the irreversible progression of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. However, the regulatory mechanism in the interaction between BMP4-Smad1 signaling and SOX9 expression in MCs during the process of diabetic glomerular injuries has not been fully elucidated.Though hypoxia has been considered a pivotal contributor to tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis in the progression of kidney disease (22Manotham K. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Ohse T. Miyata T. Inagi R. Kurokawa K. Fujita T. Nangaku M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1277-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), recent studies revealed that hypoxia or ischemic stress also affects MCs in various kidney diseases (23Nishi H. Inagi R.

Therefore, in addition to hyperglycemia, local hypoxia or ischemic stress and hypoxia-regulated gene expression also could be important factors at the advanced phase of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. A key mediator in cellular responses to hypoxic conditions is hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a heterodimeric transcription factor consisting of a constitutively expressed β subunit and an O2-regulated α subunit. A recent report revealed that high glucose also induces HIF-1α expression in MCs (26Xia L. Wang H. Munk S. Frecker H. Goldberg H.J. Fantus I.G. Whiteside C.I. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: E1280-E1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, HIF-1α also could be an important exacerbating factor in the development of glomerulosclerosis. The chondrocyte is a unique cell located at a permanent state of physiological hypoxia, and hypoxia and HIF-1α support cartilaginous matrix accumulation (27Pfander D. Cramer T. Schipani E. Johnson R.S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 28Cramer T. Schipani E. Johnson R.S. Swoboda B. Pfander D. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2004; 12: 433-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and are permissive factors in chondrocyte differentiation (29Malladi P. Xu Y. Chiou M. Giaccia A.J. Longaker M.T. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: C1139-C1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 30Xu Y. Malladi P. Chiou M. Bekerman E. Giaccia A.J. Longaker M.T. Tissue Eng. 2007; 13: 2981-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chondrocyte-related main matrix proteins, such as COL2a1 and aggrecan, are not direct targets of HIF but are up-regulated by hypoxia through cartilage-specific transcription factor SOX9 (31Amarilio R. Viukov S.V. Sharir A. Eshkar-Oren I. Johnson R.S. Zelzer E. Development. 2007; 134: 3917-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Based on these findings, we hypothesized that MCs acquire a chondrocyte-like phenotype that SOX9 mediates during glomerulosclerosis progression. We describe here a novel mechanism of chondrogenic phenotype change of MCs in the developing DN.DISCUSSIONMC, a mesenchymally derived cell, provides structural support to the glomerulus by producing ECM components that form the mesangial matrix (44Schlondorff D. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Mesenchymal progenitor or stem cells have multipotential differentiation capacity, allowing development along the chondrogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, and adipogenic lineages. In addition, phenotypic change in MCs is an important pathological change in glomerular injury and is the forerunner of glomerulosclerosis. Although many reports have demonstrated that the trans-differentiation of adult MCs to activated myofibroblastic cells is a characteristic change, in this study we showed that MCs have chondrogenic potential under the micromass culture method, thus demonstrating that MCs have chondrogenic potential in DN. This novel potential of trans-differentiation is mediated by the induction of SOX9, a master transcriptional factor of chondrogenesis. Recently, several strands of evidence have implicated unexpected SOX9 expression in diseases such as within the media of calcified vasculature (45Neven E. Dauwe S. De Broe M.E. D'Haese P.C. Persy V. Kidney Int. 2007; 72: 574-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), in skin keloid lesions (areas of excessive scarring following trauma) (46Naitoh M. Kubota H. Ikeda M. Tanaka T. Shirane H. Suzuki S. Nagata K. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and in liver fibrosis (18Hanley K.P. Oakley F. Sugden S. Wilson D.I. Mann D.A. Hanley N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14063-14071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), causing irreversible changes along with abnormal ECM deposition. Therefore, the acquisition of the chondrocytic phenotype in MCs may be involved in the irreversible changes of diabetic glomerulosclerosis.In response to a variety of injuries, MCs are generally known to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, a specialized population of mesenchymal cells that synthesize an array of different extracellular matrix proteins (i.e. type I and type III collagens) that are not normally present in the mesangial matrix and markedly up-regulate the expression of smooth-muscle-like proteins (i.e. SMA) (4Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N. Nagai K. Takahashi T. Arai H. Kita T. Doi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14201-14206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 47Desmoulière A. Geinoz A.

Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that Smad1 transcriptionally regulates the expression of SMA and collagens. Moreover, we have shown that SOX9 influences the transcriptional enhancement of COL4 (14Sumi E. Iehara N. Akiyama H. Matsubara T. Mima A. Kanamori H. Fukatsu A. Salant D.J. Kita T. Arai H. Doi T. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 1854-1864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but we still lack mechanistic insight into how SOX9 expression is regulated in DN. Here we have demonstrated that the expression of SOX9 can be induced by BMP4 treatment in MCs. AGE treatment also induced SOX9 expression as well as BMP4 in MCs, suggesting that the BMP4-SOX9 signaling pathway is activated in MCs in diabetes.The chronic hypoxia conditions of cartilage do not compromise chondrocyte viability, as these cells appear to have developed specific mechanisms to adapt to this environment (49Rajpurohit R. Koch C.J. Tao Z. Teixeira C.M. Shapiro I.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a fundamental mediator that is required for the regulation of chondrocyte metabolism. Although hypoxia has been considered a pivotal factor contributing to tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis in the progression of kidney disease (23Nishi H. Inagi R. Kato H. Tanemoto M. Kojima I. Son D. Fujita T. Nangaku M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the role of hypoxia on the progression of irreversible changes in diabetic glomeruli has yet to be determined. In the present study, we have shown that hypoxic stress as well as hyperglycemia induces phenotypic alteration of MCs. In addition to hyperglycemia, hypoxia is thought to be an important microenvironmental factor in the progression of diabetic kidney injury. This trans-differentiation into a chondrogenic phenotype to adapt to chronic hypoxia may be a critical event during the development of glomerulosclerosis. Although HIF-1 is essential for hypoxia-induced angiogenesis in the brain, heart, lungs, or muscle (50Isner J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), similar adaptive angiogenic responses do not occur in advanced diabetic glomerulosclerosis due to the tuft of glomerular capillary blood vessels located in Bowman's capsule. In general, tissue-level matrix stiffness has a definitive effect on the cell lineage specification (51Engler A.J. Sen S. Sweeney H.L. Discher D.E. Cell. 2006; 126: 677-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10052) Google Scholar), and thereby the hypoxia-induced chondrogenic phenotypic change in MCs and subsequent chondrogenic ECM production, which are characteristics of chondrocytes, can be implicated in irreversible glomerular structural changes leading to ESKD because of the up-regulated production of ECM.The histological hallmark of the DN is mesangial sclerosis, which is characterized by an accumulation of ECM in the mesangial areas, leading to progressive obliteration of the vascular spaces and subsequent ischemic state in its advanced stage. Therefore, we analyzed iNOS Tgm, because they exhibited mesangial expansion and nodular-like lesions resembling an advanced stage of human DN, on the other hand, diabetic models including streptozotocin-induced model show minor glomerular changes. We selected the male heavy proteinuria-positive line from iNOS Tgm. They developed a generalized and diffuse hyperplasia of the mesangial matrix, GBM thickening, and heavy albuminuria. These changes are significantly similar to human DN. The responsible molecule of this established model remains to be elucidated, however, these glomerular lesions were ameliorated by blocking the AGE signaling pathway. These findings suggest iNOS Tgm is an appropriate model for investigating an advanced stage of human DN (39Yamamoto Y. Kato I. Doi T. Yonekura H. Ohashi S. Takeuchi M. Watanabe T. Yamagishi S. Sakurai S. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Yamamoto H. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 52Ohashi S. Abe H. Takahashi T. Yamamoto Y. Takeuchi M. Arai H. Nagata K.

Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2510-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).In the present study, iNOS Tgm developed severe glomerulosclerosis and showed ectopic induction of BMP4, SOX9, and COL2. In particular, BMP4 is a crucial regulator in the process of chondrogenesis that increases the condensation of limb mesenchyme and directly induces the expression of chondrogenic genes, including SOX9 (54Semba I. Nonaka K. Takahashi I. Takahashi K. Dashner R. Shum L. Nuckolls G.H. Slavkin H.C. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 55Zehentner B.K. Dony C. Burtscher H. J. Bone Miner Res. 1999; 14: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we very recently revealed that BMP4 plays a central role in the development of DN. BMP4 Tgm showed pathological changes consistent with the features of typical diabetic mesangial matrix hyperplasia and also showed ectopic induction of SOX9 and COL2. As described above, the BMP signal pathway and SOX9 are required for the onset of chondrogenesis, suggesting that BMP4 and SOX9 are candidate regulators of phenotypic change of MC in the advanced stage of DN.In conclusion, our study suggests that MCs have chondrogenic potential, a new mechanism of impaired differentiation via the induction of ectopic SOX9. Chondrocytes are the only cells found in cartilage, an avascular and hypoxic mesenchymal tissue (56Harada S. Rodan G.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Therefore, it makes sense that MCs acquire the chondrogenic phenotype mediated by ectopic SOX9 to operate a cellular-protective mechanism for chronic pathological hypoxic stress in the kidney. BMP4 and HIF-1α, which are known to be upstream molecules of SOX9, have important influences on the phenotypic change of MC into a chondrocyte-like cell in DN. This impaired differentiation mechanism of MCs could be a key event in the development and progression of the irreversible stage of DN.

The characteristic glomerular changes resulting from DN are thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and expansion of the mesangial area caused by increased mesangial extracellular matrix (ECM). Mesangial cells (MCs) are the major source of ECM synthesis in diabetic glomeruli (1Lenz O. Striker L.J. Jacot T.A. Elliot S.J. Killen P.D. Striker G.E. J. Am. Soc.

Hyperglycemia, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) are implicated in the progression of DN by stimulating ECM production in MCs (4Abe H. Matsubara T.

In addition, the phenotypic modulation and dedifferentiation of MCs, which are derived from mesenchymal cells, are key pathological events (7Makino H. Kashihara N. Sugiyama H. Kanao K. Sekikawa T. Shikata K. Nagai R. Ota Z. J. Diabetes Complications. 1995; 9: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 1769-1782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). MCs acquired phenotypes not only of activated smooth muscle cells but also of fibroblasts, and subsequently secrete excess ECM proteins.We previously reported that Smad1 is a direct transcriptional regulator of type IV collagen (COL4), a major component of increased mesangial ECM in DN, as well as other ECM proteins such as type I collagen (COL1), osteopontin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (4Abe H.

The most critical feature of glomerulosclerosis is mesangial expansion, which is strongly correlated with decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (10Mauer S.M. Steffes M.W. Ellis E.N. Sutherland D.E. Brown D.M. Goetz F.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Most importantly, we found that the glomerular expression levels of Smad1 are clearly correlated with the severities of mesangial matrix expansion in rodent DN (9Matsubara T. Abe H. Arai H. Nagai K. Mima A. Kanamori H. Sumi E. Takahashi T. Matsuura M. Iehara N. Fukatsu A. Kita T. Doi T. Lab. Invest. 2006; 86: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Mima A. Arai H. Matsubara T.

Diabetes. 2008; 57: 1712-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have concluded that Smad1 plays a central role in the development of DN. However, we still lack mechanistic insight into how Smad1 is involved in phenotypic alteration of MCs and in the irreversible progression of DN. It is generally acknowledged that Smad1 transduces TGF-β signals and also transduces BMP signals through its receptors (12Chen W. Fu X. Sheng Z. Chin. Med. J. 2002; 115: 446-450PubMed Google Scholar, 13Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). Although impairment of vascular wall integrity caused by mesangial matrix expansion leads to irreversible glomerulosclerosis, the molecular mechanisms underlying this irreversible change in the phenotypes of MCs in advanced DN are still unknown. We also demonstrated previously that a transcription factor, SRY-related HMG Box 9 (SOX9), is involved in the modulation of transcriptional enhancement of COL4 (14Sumi E. Iehara N. Akiyama H. Matsubara T. Mima A. Kanamori H. Fukatsu A. Salant D.J. Kita T. Arai H. Doi T. Am. J.

https://openalex.org/W2042811250,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized at the molecular level by the expression of Bcr-Abl, a chimeric protein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is up-regulated in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells, suggesting a regulatory link between the two proteins. To investigate the interplay between these two proteins, we inhibited the activity of PTP1B in Bcr-Abl-expressing TonB.210 cells by either pharmacological or siRNA means and examined the effects of such inhibition on Bcr-Abl expression and function. Herein we describe a novel mechanism by which the phosphatase activity of PTP1B is required for Bcr-Abl protein stability. Inhibition of PTP1B elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl that triggers the degradation of Bcr-Abl through ubiquitination via the lysosomal pathway. The degradation of Bcr-Abl consequently inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl substrates and the downstream production of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, PTP1B inhibition reduces cell viability and the IC(50) of the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib mesylate. Degradation of Bcr-Abl via PTP1B inhibition is also observed in human CML cell lines K562 and LAMA-84. These results suggest that inhibition of PTP1B may be a useful strategy to explore in the development of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CML, particularly because host drugs currently used in CML such as imatinib focus on inhibiting the kinase activity of Bcr-Abl."
