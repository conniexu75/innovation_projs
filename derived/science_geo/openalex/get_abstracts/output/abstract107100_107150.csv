https://openalex.org/W1549577793,"Fibrates have been reported to modulate plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I concentrations. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of human apoA-I gene expression by fibrates was investigated. Fenofibrate reduced the expression of a reporter gene driven by the DNA sequences between -192 and +91 (BC-P-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CAT) relative to the apoA-I gene transcription start site approximately 3-fold. The sequences involved in the down-regulation of apoA-I gene transcription by fenofibrate were localized between -41 and +91 (P-CAT) relative to the transcription start site. The reduction of the expression of BC-P-CAT was dose-dependent and maximal at 500 microM (20 +/- 7%). Different peroxisome proliferators showed different levels of repression varying from 39 +/- 4% for fenofibrate, 43 +/- 5% for tetradecylthioacetic acid, 48 +/- 4% for bezafibrate, 54 +/- 2% for 5,8,11,14-eicotetraynoic acid, 76 +/- 2% for ciprofibrate, whereas Wy 14643 only marginally inhibited the expression of BC-P-CAT. By contrast, inclusion of sequences between -256 and -192 (ABC-P-CAT) attenuated the repression by fenofibrate. Furthermore, the apoA-IA site (-214 to -192; Awt-P-CAT) could counteract the repression of P-CAT by fenofibrate in the presence of cotransfected mPPAR alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor). In addition, the acyl-CoA oxidase-peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) could substitute the wild-type A-site in blocking the fenofibrate-induced reduction of the apoA-I promoter by mPPAR alpha. The protective effect of PPAR on fenofibrate induced inhibition of apoA-I expression was abolished after mutation of the direct repeat in the A site (Am-P-CAT). Consistent with these functional data only the wild-type, but not the mutated A site bound PPAR/retinoic X receptor heterodimers in gel shift assays. These data suggest that certain peroxisome proliferators can reduce the expression of the apoA-I promoter in a PPAR-independent fashion, through modulation of factors interacting with sequences localized between -41 and +91 of the apoA-I gene transcription initiation site. This inhibitory effect can be overcome when PPAR interacts with a functional PPRE, such as the apoA-I A site or the acyl-CoA oxidase-PPRE."
https://openalex.org/W1522274444,"Several genes critical to the uptake, sequestration, and utilization of iron are regulated at the post-transcriptional level. The mRNAs encoded by these genes contain highly conserved stem-loop structures called iron-responsive elements (IREs). IREs function as the nucleic acid-binding sites for a cytosolic RNA-binding protein called the IRE-binding protein or IRE-BP. Binding of the IRE-BP to IREs is reversibly regulated by the iron status of the cell. The IRE-BP is highly conserved among human, rat, mouse, and rabbit, and it is identical to the cytosolic form of aconitase. In this study, we demonstrate that a distinct human gene encoding a protein which is 57% identical to the initially described IRE-BP, now referred to as iron regulatory protein 1 or IRP1, is also capable of binding to IREs with the same in vitro affinity and specificity the originally identified protein. This second gene product, which we call IRP2, is expressed in many tissues, but its mRNA abundance and tissue distribution are different from IRP1. In most cell lines tested, levels of IRP2 are inversely regulated by iron levels due to iron-dependent regulation of the half-life of the protein. In addition to changes in total amounts of IRP2, we demonstrate that the IRE binding activity of IRP2 can also vary up to 4-fold in the absence of any change in IRP2 protein levels. The possible reasons for the existence of a second IRP are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1499968412,"To locate essential determinants for angiotensin II binding, we have performed a systematic mutational analysis of the exterior domain of the AT1 receptor. Receptor mutants, deficient in peptide binding, were analyzed using radiolabeled nonpeptide ligand as an important tool. Two independent strategies for mutagenesis were employed: conservative segment exchange and point mutagenesis of evolutionarily conserved residues. Results from the conservative segment exchange in which 6-17 residues were replaced with chemically similar, yet different, amino acid sequences of the same length suggested that important peptide ligand binding epitopes are located in the N-terminal extension of the AT1 receptor, in particular adjacent to the top of transmembrane segment I (TM-I), and in the third extracellular loop, close to the top of TM-VII. The substitution of residues from either of these regions resulted in a 5,000-20,000-fold decrease in affinity for the peptide agonist angiotensin II (AII) and the peptide antagonist [Sar1,Leu8]AII without affecting the binding of nonpeptide antagonists. Alanine substitution of evolutionarily conserved residues demonstrated that peptide binding was dependent on several residues in the N-terminal extension, near the top of TM-I, a tyrosine residue located in extracellular loop 1, close to TM-II, and 2 aspartate residues positioned in extracellular loop 3 on the same face of an alpha-helical extension of TM-VII. In all cases the binding of nonpeptide antagonist was unaffected by these substitutions. It is concluded that important epitopes involved in angiotensin II binding are located around the top of transmembrane segments I, II, and VII which conceivably are in close spatial proximity in the folded receptor structure."
https://openalex.org/W1531475302,"Maspin, a novel mammary serine protease inhibitor, was shown to have tumor suppressing activity (Zou, Z., Anisowicz, A., Hendrix, M. J. C., Thor, A., Neveu, M., Sheng, S., Rafidi, K., Seftor, E., and Sager, R. (1994) Science 263, 526-529). In this paper, we report the production of recombinant glutathione S-transferase-maspin fusion protein, expressed in the bacterium Escherichia coli, and recombinant maspin, expressed in the insect Spodoptera frugiperda cells. The fusion protein was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. Maspin expressed in insect cells was purified by a combination of Bio-Rad AG1-2X anion exchange chromatography and heparin affinity chromatography. The recombinant maspin from insect cells was cleaved at the putative reactive center, as confirmed by protein sequencing. Both recombinant proteins demonstrated strong inhibitory effects on the invasion by two breast tumor cell lines across reconstituted basement membranes and such inhibitory effect was abolished in the presence of the polyclonal antibody made against the reactive center region of maspin. The trypsin-cleaved recombinant maspin did not inhibit invasion, indicating that the inhibitory activity requires the intact putative reactive center. This paper provides evidence that recombinant maspin protein itself inhibits invasion, and supports the role of maspin as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W1588859815,"Phospholipase D, which mediates phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis in response to agonist stimulation, is an important component of signal transduction. We now report the purification of this enzyme to homogeneity from pig lung microsomes. The enzyme was solubilized with heptylthioglucoside and purified 2,200-fold by successive chromatography on sulfate-Cellulofine, ether-Toyopearl, chelate-Toyopearl, Q-Sepharose, heparin-Toyopearl, and hydroxyapatite. The final enzyme preparation gave a single protein band of M(r) = 190,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme hydrolyzed phosphatidylcholine but not lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol. Optimum pH was 6.6. Half-maximal activity was obtained at 0.8 mM dipalmitoylglycerophosphocholine. The products were identified as phosphatidic acid and choline, but in the presence of ethanol, phosphatidylethanol was produced at the expense of phosphatidic acid. Ethanolamine and serine were not utilized as the phosphatidyl acceptor. Although not obligatory, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were stimulatory at high concentrations. The enzyme was markedly stimulated by unsaturated fatty acids in the presence of Mg2+ but not in its absence or by saturated fatty acids. N-Ethylmaleimide and detergents were inhibitory. Sucrose monolaurate had an aberrant effect on enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1580325848,"A 47-kDa heat shock protein (HSP47) is a collagen-binding stress protein which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of collagen-secreting cells. Recent studies have shown that HSP47 transiently binds to newly synthesized procollagens and that conformationally abnormal procollagen is also bound by HSP47 for a much longer time in the ER (Nakai, A., Satoh, M., Hirayoshi, K., and Nagata, K. (1992) J. Cell Biol. 117, 903-914). HSP47 is thus suggested to have a collagen-specific molecular chaperone-like function. In this report, we analyzed the interaction of HSP47 and types I to V collagen using BIAcore system, an optical biosensor based on the principles of surface plasmon resonance. Types I-V collagen were purified from porcine skin, porcine articular cartilage, bovine lens capsule, and porcine placenta and immobilized on sensorchips of the BIAcore system at a surface concentration of 10-15 ng/mm2. Purified recombinant mouse HSP47 (rmHSP47) expressed in Escherichia coli was passed over the sensorchips at a flow rate of 2 microliters/min and binding curves of rmHSP47 to collagens were monitored. Using this approach, accurate association and dissociation rate constants were determined in addition to dissociation constants. rmHSP47 was found to bind to types I-V collagen with similar dissociation constants of the order of 10(-7) M. This relatively low dissociation constant resulted from the rapid dissociation rate constant (kdiss > 10(-2) s-1) and considerably high (kass approximately 2 x 10(4) M-1 s-1) association rate constant. These kinetic parameters may reflect a transient interaction between HSP47 and procollagen in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1584847179,"To investigate the role of intermediate filament (IF) protein phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase during mitosis, we developed a monoclonal antibody 4A4 recognizing Ser55-phosphorylated vimentin. Western blotting indicated that this antibody reacted with vimentin phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase but not with non-phosphorylated vimentin or with vimentin phosphorylated by other kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, or Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy showed that vimentin Ser55 residues distributed in the entire cytoplasmic vimentin filament system are phosphorylated when the cells enter mitosis and dephosphorylated in cytokinesis. All cell lines examined showed a similar appearance of immunoreactivity with antibody 4A4. Fractionation of mitotic cell extracts on Mono-Q Sepharose revealed a single peak of vimentin Ser55 kinase activity, and the anti-p34cdc2 antibody reacted with the 34 kDa band in the kinase containing fractions. Vimentin Ser55 kinase activities were nil in the interphase cell extract. Immunofluorescent evidence using antibody 4A4 and biochemical analysis using vimentin Ser55 peptide showed that the degree of disassembly of vimentin filament of various cell types at early mitotic phase correlated well with the amount of mitotically activated cdc2 kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1508227800,"The paired helical filaments (PHFs) in Alzheimer's disease neurofibrillary tangles are composed of PHF-tau which is thought to be hyperphosphorylated because several residues in postmortem samples of PHF-tau and human fetal tau are phosphorylated while the corresponding sites are not phosphorylated in autopsy-derived normal adult human brain tau. To determine how the phosphorylation of these sites is regulated, we isolated tau from rat brains at different embryonic and postnatal ages in the presence of okadaic acid to obtain tau in its most native in situ phosphorylation state. Fetal tau was highly phosphorylated from embryonic day 18 (E18) until postnatal day 11 (P11). Thereafter, the levels of fetal tau diminished as did its phosphorylation state concomitant with the appearance of the five adult tau isoforms. Several phosphorylation-dependent antibodies (i.e. AT270, AT8, AT180, T3P, and PHF1) that recognize PHF-tau also recognized these tau isoforms, albeit at reduced levels in the mature rat brain. This suggests that Thr172, Ser193, Thr222, Ser387, and Ser395 are normal sites of phosphorylation in rat brain tau. The inclusion of OK in the microtubule assembly buffers did not alter the ability of tau to bind microtubules at any age. However, phosphatases were activated and kinases were down-regulated in the rat brain after P12 since adult tau proteins were partially dephosphorylated at and beyond this time in the absence of OK. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and 2B (PP2B) activities in the adult rat brain extracts dephosphorylated tau efficiently, but protein phosphatases in extracts of the P6 rat brain did not have a similar effect. This suggests that the sensitivity of tau to OK after P12 may be regulated by the de novo induction of adult brain phosphatases. Finally, PP2A and/or PP2B in adult rat brain extracts dephosphorylated tau in a site-specific manner. Thus, PP2A and PP2B (or closely related phosphatases) may regulate the phosphorylation state of adult tau isoforms in vivo, and the generation of PHF-tau in the AD brain may result from the abnormal inactivation of similar phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1588037221,"The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBzR) is associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), an endogenous substance with high affinity for the PBzR, induced the inner membrane permeability transition (MPT) in respiring liver mitochondria de-energized by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Cyclosporin A (CyA), an inhibitor of the permeability transition, prevented this effect. In cultured hepatocytes, the MPT was measured as an increased [3H]sucrose-accessible space sensitive to CyA. Nanomolar concentrations of PPIX potentiated the induction of the MPT and the extent of cell killing in hepatocyte cultures de-energized by rotenone. CyA prevented the enhanced cell killing by PPIX. PPIX did not increase the rate or extent of ATP depletion, the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, or the accumulation of long chain acyl-CoA thioesters. The association of the PBzR with the voltage-dependent anion channel of the outer mitochondrial membrane and with the adenine nucleotide carrier of the inner membrane suggests that this complex mediates the transport of PPIX across the mitochondrial membranes. In turn, this same complex participates in the MPT. Thus, the same structural complex (PBzR, voltage-dependent anion channel, and adenine nucleotide carrier) can interact with the endogenous substrate PPIX to result in different functional consequences depending on the state of mitochondrial energization."
https://openalex.org/W2123643321,"Hormone-dependent transcriptional activation (AF-2) by the thyroid hormone beta receptor (TR beta) localizes to its carboxyl-terminal domain. A putative transactivation sequence within this domain was analyzed by mutating individual residues to alanine. Mutant receptor carboxyl-terminal domains were tested coupled to the heterologous DNA binding domain of Gal4. A single mutant receptor (E460A) showed normal hormone binding and activation, whereas several others (P453A, F455A, L456A, F459A) exhibited impaired transactivation which correlated with their reduced ligand binding. Two mutations (L454A, E457A) were able to dissociate these properties, generating transcriptionally defective mutant proteins with preserved hormone binding. A further conservative substitution (E457D) was also nonfunctional, and these three mutations were equally deleterious when tested in the context of full-length TR beta with a natural thyroid hormone response element containing promoter. This loss of activity was not due to altered DNA binding or expression of mutant receptors in cultured cells. They also retained the ability to recruit VP16-tagged retinoid X receptor in vivo as well as bind the basal transcription factors TFIIB and TBP in vitro. Our observations indicate that conserved hydrophobic (Leu454) and charged (Glu457) residues mediate AF-2 activity of TR beta, possibly via a co-activator that has yet to be identified."
https://openalex.org/W1483248795,"Mitochondria with intact outer membrane (99% intact based on cytochrome c impermeability) were isolated and used to measure the permeability of their outer membrane to ADP. beta-NADH reduced the permeability in a concentration-dependent manner (KD = 87 +/- 5 microM) by a factor of 6. alpha-NADH and beta-NAD+ cannot mimic the action of beta-NADH. The mitochondrial outer membranes become rate-limiting in the presence of beta-NADH at low, physiologically relevant, ADP concentrations ("
https://openalex.org/W2161416030,"Fusion among endosomes is an important step for transport and sorting of internalized macromolecules. Working in a cell-free system, we have previously reported that, in the absence of externally added calcium, endosome fusion requires cytosol, ATP, and is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and to anti-NEM-sensitive factor (NSF) antibody. This cytosol-dependent fusion is regulated by monomeric and heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. Further studies have revealed, however, that in the presence of micromolar concentrations of free calcium, fusion is observed even in the absence of cytosol and ATP. At the electron microscope level, Ca(2+)-dependent endosome aggregation and fusion were similar to that observed for cytosol-dependent fusion. Calcium-dependent fusion was not affected by non-hydrolyzable analogs of GTP or GDP nor by NEM or anti-NSF antibody. However, Ca(2+)-dependent fusion was abrogated by trypsin treatment of the vesicles or by a membrane wash with 60 mM EDTA indicating that peripheral proteins are required. An anti-annexin II antibody and an annexin II peptide blocked Ca(2+)-dependent fusion by 50%. After the EDTA wash, Ca(2+)-dependent fusion was reconstituted by addition of purified annexin II and arachidonic acid. We conclude that endosomes can fuse by two mechanisms, one that has an absolute requirement for calcium and is probably mediated by annexins, and another that does not require calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1481070153,"Expression of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) or Shc cDNA resulted in both increased protein and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and Shc proteins, respectively. Although expression of Shc had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase gel shift or c-fos transcriptional activation, expression of IRS1 inhibited these responses. The effect of IRS1 expression on the formation of multisubunit signaling complexes was determined by a series of indirect co-immunoprecipitations. Grb2 immunoprecipitation from IRS1-transfected and insulin-treated cells demonstrated an increased coimmunoprecipitation of Syp and the p85 regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Similarly, cell extracts immunoprecipitated with a p85 antibody displayed an increased co-immunoprecipitation of Syp and Grb2. However, expression of IRS1 increased the extent of Grb2 associated with IRS1 with a concomitant reduction in the amount of Grb2 associated with Shc. Furthermore, increased expression of Shc reduced the amount of Grb2 bound to IRS1 with a concomitant increase in Grb2 associated with Shc. Together, these data demonstrate that IRS1 and Shc compete for a limited cellular pool of Grb2, and insulin activation of MAP kinase and c-fos transcription predominantly occur through the Shc-Grb2 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1580353693,"Palmitoylation is a dynamic, post-translational modification of the amino terminus of heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits. Since myristoylation, beta gamma interactions, and membrane attachment also involve the amino terminus of the G protein alpha i1 subunit, we studied the relationships between palmitoylation and these events. Using COS cell transfection, the turnover of palmitate was slower on alpha i1 subunits co-expressed with beta and gamma subunits than on the alpha i1 subunit expressed alone. Mutation of cysteine 3 of alpha i1 prevented [2H]palmitate but not [3H]myristate incorporation and decreased the membrane localization of this protein. This nonpalmitoylated mutant could form a heterotrimer with co-expressed beta gamma subunits which restored its membrane localization. A nonmyristoylated alpha i1 mutant (glycine 2 to alanine) could incorporate [3H]palmitate when co-expressed with beta gamma subunits and localized to the membrane. The [3H]palmitate turnover of this nonmyristoylated mutant was more rapid than seen with the wild-type alpha i1 subunit. While myristoylation is not required for palmitoylation, both myristoylation and beta gamma association can slow the turnover of palmitate on alpha i1. These results suggest that palmitoylation maintains the membrane attachment of the free alpha subunit and changes in beta gamma association could modulate palmitoylation during signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1515619928,"We have demonstrated recently that in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a membrane-associated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) phosphorylates and activates the Ca(2+)-pumping ATPase (Ca(2+)-ATPase) in addition to phosphorylating the previously characterized substrates, phospholamban, and Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor) (Xu, A., Hawkins, C., and Narayanan, N. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 8394-8397). The present study shows that a CaM kinase regulatory system capable of modulating SR Ca2+ pump activity through direct phosphorylation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase is functional in slow twitch but not fast twitch skeletal muscle. Incubation of SR vesicles isolated from rabbit slow twitch (soleus) and fast twitch (adductor magnus) skeletal muscles in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin resulted in phosphorylation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase in slow twitch muscle SR but not in fast twitch muscle SR. Exogenous CaM kinase II, which stimulated phosphorylation of the cardiac and slow twitch muscle SR Ca(2+)-ATPase, failed to phosphorylate fast twitch muscle SR Ca(2+)-ATPase. These observations demonstrate that CaM kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of the Ca2+ pump is isoform-specific since heart and slow twitch muscle express the same Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform (SERCA2a), which is distinct from that of fast twitch muscle (SERCA1). As in the case of cardiac SR Ca(2+)-ATPase, phosphorylation of the slow twitch muscle SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (occurring at a serine residue) resulted in a 2-fold increase in catalytic activity of the enzyme without alteration in its Ca2+ sensitivity. In addition, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent prephosphorylation of slow twitch muscle SR resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in its Ca2+ transport activity. In both cardiac and slow twitch muscle SR, phosphorylation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase by the endogenous CaM kinase occurred rapidly (maximum within 2 min at 37 degrees C), had similar pH optimum (8.5-9.0), temperature optimum (30 degrees C), and calmodulin concentration-dependence (k0.5 50-60 nM). cAMP-dependent protein kinase did not phosphorylate the Ca(2+)-ATPase appreciably in either cardiac or slow twitch muscle SR. These findings suggest a muscle-specific role for the membrane-associated CaM kinase in the modulation of Ca2+ uptake and release functions of the SR. In cardiac and slow twitch muscle, phosphorylation of the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase by CaM kinase might provide a novel mechanism for the modulation of the enzymatic and Ca2+ transport functions of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1527114364,"Desmosomes are adhesive intercellular junctions that act as cell surface attachment sites for intermediate filaments. The desmosomal glycoproteins, desmogleins and desmocollins, are members of the cadherin family of adhesion molecules. In addition, desmoglein has been shown to coimmunoprecipitate with the junctional protein plakoglobin. To characterize further the interaction between plakoglobin and the desmosomal cadherins, stable mouse fibroblast (L-cells) cell lines were generated that express plakoglobin, desmoglein and plakoglobin, or desmocollin and plakoglobin. L-cell lines transfected with a plasmid encoding human plakoglobin expressed plakoglobin mRNA but very little plakoglobin protein. However, plakoglobin protein was expressed at high levels in L-cells coexpressing either desmoglein or desmocollin. In addition, both desmocollin and desmoglein were found to coimmunoprecipitate with plakoglobin. The transient expression of desmoglein in L-cell lines expressing plakoglobin mRNA resulted in the formation of a complex between plakoglobin and desmoglein and in the accumulation of plakoglobin protein. Furthermore, the rate of plakoglobin protein degradation was decreased by 15-20-fold in cell lines expressing either desmoglein or desmocollin. These results demonstrate that the desmosomal cadherins posttranslationally regulate plakoglobin expression by decreasing the rate of plakoglobin degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1601384284,"Intercalating, minor groove binding, and covalently bonding drugs were evaluated by mobility shift assays for their ability to interfere with transcription factors binding to their respective DNA recognition sequences. The Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins EGR1, WT1, and NIL2A, the basic leucine-zipper protein wbJun/wbFos, and the minor groove binding protein hTBP were chosen as representative transcription factors. Their DNA recognition sites include G/C-rich, mixed, and A/T-rich sequences. The intercalators nogalamycin and hedamycin, and the G/C-specific minor groove binding drug chromomycin A3 were the most potent drugs, preventing transcription factor.DNA complex formation at concentrations less than 1 microM. Similar concentrations of chromomycin A3 disrupted preformed complexes while nogalamycin and hedamycin were 50-fold less potent if proteins were allowed to bind DNA prior to drug treatment. Echinomycin inhibited EGR1.DNA complex formation 50% at 5 microM but had little effect on the formation of NIL2A.DNA complexes. Conversely, doxorubicin was found to inhibit NIL2A complex formation 50% at less than 1 microM, but did not achieve this level of inhibition of EGR1/DNA complex formation even at 50 microM. The A/T-directed minor groove binding drugs, while inhibiting hTBP at submicromolar concentrations, had no effect on either EGR1 or NIL2A."
https://openalex.org/W2110324701,"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a foldase of the endoplasmic recticulum, is a multifunctional protein that catalyzes the formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds during protein folding. The wild-type protein contains two redox active thiol/disulfide sites near the N and C terminus that are homologous to the redox center of thioredoxin. Using site-directed mutagenesis, both cysteines of each of the thioredoxin-like centers, (C35S,C38S) and (C379S,C382S) were replaced by serines. In addition, a mutant PDI was constructed with all four of the active cysteines mutated to serine (C35S,C38S,C379S,C382S). The activity of the wild-type and mutant proteins in the oxidative renaturation of reduced, denatured RNase was analyzed over a wide range of RNase concentrations, PDI concentrations, and glutathione redox buffers compositions. All mutants, including the construct with no functional thioredoxin centers, have measurable disulfide isomerase activity. Both of the thioredoxin-like sites contribute some to apparent steady-state binding (Km) and catalysis at saturating substrate concentrations (kcat); however, their contributions are not equivalent. At saturating concentrations of RNase, the mutant with an inactivated C-terminal active site (kcat = 0.72 +/- 0.06 min-1) retains near wild-type activity (kcat = 0.76 +/- 0.02 min-1), while the N-terminal mutant exhibits a significantly lower kcat (0.24 +/- 0.01 min-1). The Km for RNase is elevated for the C-terminal mutant (Km = 29 +/- 4 microM) while the N-terminal mutant (Km = 7.1 +/- 1.1 microM) exhibits a wild-type Km (6.9 +/- 0.8 microM). The larger Km for the C-terminal mutant (4.2 times wild-type) and the lower kcat of N-terminal mutant (32% of wild-type) suggest that the C-terminal region contributes more to apparent steady-state substrate binding, and the N-terminal region contributes more to catalysis at saturating concentrations of substrate. Despite their complementary roles in catalysis, the thioredoxin-like centers exhibit the same dependence on the glutathione redox buffer composition as evidenced by the equivalent K(ox) values for the wild-type (47 +/- 1 microM), N-terminal mutant (43 +/- 3 microM), and C-terminal mutant (44 +/- 1 microM). The mutant with both thioredoxin sites mutated displays a low but detectable level of disulfide-isomerase activity (0.5% of wild-type) that can be observed at high PDI concentrations. At high RNase concentrations (> or = 26 microM), wild-type PDI and all of the mutants catalyze intermolecular RNase aggregation in a nucleation growth reaction that is first order in PDI but fourth order with respect to RNase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1563557658,"Several regions within the triple-helical domain of type IV collagen function as cellular recognition sites. We have demonstrated previously that melanoma cell activities promoted by the alpha 1(IV)1263-1277 sequence are enhanced by triple helicity (Fields, C. G., Mickelson, D. J., Drake, S.L., McCarthy, J.B., and Fields, G.B. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14153-14160), whereas Eble et al. reached similar conclusions for alpha 1 beta 1 integrin-mediated fibrosarcoma cell adhesion to [alpha 1(IV)]2 alpha 2(IV)434-472 (Eble, J. A., Golbik, R., Mann, K., and Kuhn, K. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 4795-4802). In the present study, we have examined the cell adhesion activities of a third region in type IV collagen. A single-stranded peptide (SSP) incorporating the alpha 1(IV)531-543 sequence promoted the adhesion of melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, and Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner, with 40% cell adhesion observed at [SSP] = 1.8, 11.5, and 42.2 microM, respectively. Nearly identical results were obtained for cell adhesion to an all-D-enantiomer of the SSP, suggesting that the cell surface receptor(s) for this site do not discriminate based on chirality. The alpha 1(IV)531-543 sequence maintained its cell adhesion promoting activity when incorporated into a homotrimeric triple-helical polypeptide, although relative levels of adhesion were either slightly enhanced or slightly diminished compared with the SSP. Triple-helical conformation was thus not critical for cellular recognition of the alpha 1(IV)531-543 sequence. Single-site substitution experiments of the SSP showed no overall correlation between the biological effects of substitutions and SSP conformation. The SSP, D-SSP, triple-helical polypeptide, and SSP substitution results suggest that cell recognition of the alpha 1(IV)531-543 sequence is generally of substrate conformation. The present and prior studies indicate that conformationally dependent and conformationally independent cellular recognition sites exist within the triple-helical domain of type IV collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1037454573,"Chorionic gonadotropin (CG) is a heterodimeric placental hormone encoded by separate alpha and beta subunit genes that is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy. The production of CG is stimulated by DNA synthesis inhibitors and by cAMP. The present study demonstrates that the proto-oncogene c-jun represses transcription of the human CG alpha and CG beta promoters. c-Jun repressed the CG alpha promoter through a canonical cAMP response element (CRE) that is known to bind c-Jun and other members of the B-Zip transcription factor family. In the CG beta promoter, two adjacent sites, CRE1 (-299 to -289) and CRE2 (-240 to -219), conveyed cAMP responsiveness via sequences that are distinct from the canonical element, TGACGTCA. Mutations within CG beta CRE1 or CRE2 reduced or abolished, respectively, c-Jun-mediated repression. Although the CG beta CREs do not contain consensus sequences previously described to bind c-Jun, CRE2 bound c-Jun and c-Fos in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Supershift assays, using anti-JUN antibody, demonstrated that Jun formed part of the native complex that binds the CRE2 in JEG-3 cells. A series of c-Jun mutants were used to analyze the transcription factor domains required for repression of the CG subunit promoters. The DNA binding and leucine zipper domains of c-Jun as well as the amino terminus, were required for repression of both subunit promoters. Thus, both the CG alpha and CG beta genes are repressed by c-Jun through promoter regions that convey cAMP-induced transcription, although these DNA sequences are unrelated."
https://openalex.org/W1529636865,"Insulin activates the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate signaling molecules such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Phosphorylated IRS-1 binds to SH2 domains in the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidyl inositol (PI) 3-kinase, thereby stimulating the catalytic activity of PI 3-kinase. For most growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (including receptors for epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor), the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase binds directly to phosphorylated YXXM motifs contained in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor itself. Previous studies in cell-free systems have shown that the phosphorylated YHTM sequence (amino acid residues 1322-1325) in the COOH terminus of the insulin receptor has the ability to bind to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, thereby activating the enzyme. In this investigation, we demonstrate the occurrence of the same direct binding interaction in intact cells. Subsequent to insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, a complex is formed that contains the insulin receptor and PI 3-kinase. This complex can be immunoprecipitated by antibodies directed against either the insulin receptor or the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. The delta 43 mutant insulin receptor that lacks 43 amino acids at the COOH terminus does not bind p85. In addition, the delta 43 truncation impairs the ability of the receptor to mediate the activation of PI 3-kinase. Thus, by binding directly to p85, the phosphorylated YHTM motif in the COOH terminus of the insulin receptor contributes partially to mediating the effect of insulin to activate PI 3-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1557509873,"The human progesterone receptor (PR), a member of the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, is expressed in most tissues as two forms that exhibit differential transcriptional activation potentials, full-length PR-B and NH2-terminally truncated PR-A. In human breast cancer cells (T47D) both forms of PR are constitutively phosphorylated but phosphorylation is increased in response to hormone treatment, suggesting that this modification has a role in regulating the activation state of the receptor. To more directly define the functional role of phosphorylation in the action of A and B receptors requires knowledge of the phosphorylated amino acid residues and the protein kinase(s) involved. Toward this end we have developed a strategy that combines isolation of PR phosphotryptic peptides by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, secondary analytical protease digestion, manual Edman degradation, and release of 32P that resulted in identification of two major phosphorylation sites, Ser81 and Ser162. Both sites are located in the amino-terminal region unique to PR-B, and one of these sites (Ser81) is encompassed in a casein kinase II (CKII) consensus sequence. Although human PR contains 11 potential CKII consensus sequences, CKII in vitro phosphorylated purified PR-B only at Ser81 suggesting that this may be an authentic site for CKII in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1593565155,"Guanylate cyclase-activating protein (GCAP) is a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein that stimulates synthesis of cGMP in photoreceptors. Molecular cloning of human and mouse GCAP cDNA revealed that the known mammalian GCAPs are more than 90% similar, consist of 201-205 amino acids, and contain three identically conserved EF hand Ca2+ binding sites. The sequence homology with recoverin, a related photoreceptor Ca(2+)-binding protein, is less than 35%. In situ hybridization in primate retinas shows that the GCAP gene is expressed exclusively in photoreceptor inner segments. To investigate the GCAP gene structure, we probed 10 eucaryotic genomic DNAs with a bovine GCAP cDNA under stringent conditions. The results demonstrate that the GCAP gene has been well conserved during evolution of vertebrate species and that each gene is most likely present as a single copy. By genomic cloning, polymerase chain reaction, mapping, and direct sequencing, we show that the human GCAP gene spans approximately 6 kilobases of genomic DNA, and consists of four exons (> 250, 146, 94, and 800 base pairs) separated by three introns (4.5 kilobases, 370 base pairs, and 347 base pairs). Using human/hamster hybrid panels and fluorescent in situ hybridization, the GCAP gene was localized to the short arm of chromosome 6 (p21.1)."
https://openalex.org/W1768439806,"Synaptotagmin, an integral membrane protein localized to secretory vesicles, has been implicated in the docking and fusion steps in calcium-regulated exocytosis. The large cytoplasmic domain contains two C2 motifs, each similar to the Ca2+ and phospholipid binding domain of protein kinase C. To study the membrane binding and aggregating properties of these C2 domains, three recombinant fragments of rat synaptotagmin I were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. A recombinant protein containing both C2 domains (p65 1-5) was found to bind to and aggregate bovine chromaffin granules in a calcium-dependent manner, with half-maximal binding and aggregation occurring at approximately p Ca2+ = 4.2. However, recombinant proteins containing either the first (p65 1-3) or second (p65 3-5) C2 domain alone were not able to bind to the granules, indicating that both C2 domains are required for binding to chromaffin granules. p65 1-5 also bound to and aggregated liposomes made from chromaffin granule lipid extracts, as well as granules treated extensively with trypsin, suggesting that p65 1-5 binding to granules is mediated by the lipids in the granule membrane and not the granule membrane proteins. Although p65 1-3 and p65 3-5 did not bind to granules or lipids extracted from granules, both did bind to phosphatidylserine (PS)/phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles (10%-40%PS). Half-maximal binding of p65 1-3 to vesicles occurred at approximately p Ca2+ = 5.2, while p65 3-5 appeared to bind independently of calcium over the range of pCa2+ = 5.5-2.8. p65 1-5 exhibited binding to PS/PC vesicles with characteristics of both the smaller proteins, displaying some binding in EGTA and increased binding in calcium. Larger amounts of p65 1-5 bound to PS/PC vesicles than of either of the smaller fragments. These results suggest that the two C2 domains of synaptotagmin act synergistically to promote binding to biological membranes and to affect calcium sensitivity and membrane binding capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1502598448,"Monodehydroascorbate radicals are generated in plant cells enzymatically by the hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzyme, ascorbate peroxidase, and nonenzymatically via the univalent oxidation of ascorbate by superoxide, hydroxyl, and various organic radicals. Regeneration of ascorbate is achieved by monodehydroascorbate reductase (EC 1.6.5.4) using NAD(P)H as an electron donor or, alternatively, by a set of two coupled reactions requiring dehydroascorbate reductase, glutathione reductase, glutathione, and NAD(P)H. As monodehydroascorbate reductase is a key enzyme in maintaining reduced pools of ascorbate, an important antioxidant, we undertook this study to learn more about its structure, function, and regulation. Herein we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding monodehydroascorbate reductase of pea (Pisum sativum L.). The cDNA encodes a 433-amino acid polypeptide that shows, respectively, 73 and 87% identity with peptide fragments from soybean and cucumber monodehydroascorbate reductase. Monodehydroascorbate reductase contains the NAD(P)H and FAD binding domains of other flavin oxidoreductases. The cloned enzyme lacks a transit peptide, but the sequence of the carboxyl terminus is Ser-Lys-Ile, similar to the targeting motif found in peroxisomal proteins. When expressed in Escherichia coli fused to maltose-binding protein, monodehydroascorbate reductase has enzymatic properties comparable with purified soybean and cucumber monodehydroascorbate reductase. Northern blot analysis shows that the monodehydroascorbate reductase transcript is 1.6 kilobase in size and is expressed at relatively low levels in all plant tissues examined."
https://openalex.org/W1598360173,"Transcription factors play important roles in regulating cell growth and differentiation. egr-1, a transcription factor of the zinc finger family, is rapidly activated in many types of cells after mitogen treatment. In this report, we demonstrate that egr-1 mRNA expression, detected by Northern blotting, is activated within 30 min of treatment of the erythroleukemia cell line K562 with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and the increased egr-1 mRNA level is associated with an elevated egr-1 antigen expression detected by Western blotting and with its DNA binding activity shown by the gel mobility shift assay. In addition, PMA-mediated activation of egr-1 mRNA expression involves no new protein synthesis and is followed by sequential down-regulation of the mRNA level of GATA-1 and glycophorin A. On the other hand, CD41a surface antigen expression is dramatically up-regulated. Furthermore, enforced expression of egr-1, through transfection of K562 cells with the egr-1 expression plasmid construct, results in expression of the egr-1 transcript that accompanies a significant accumulation on the cell surface of CD41a but not CD14 nor glycophorin A. These observations suggest that egr-1 is involved in regulating PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1599007193,"The 4-kDa beta-amyloid peptide (A beta), a major constituent of parenchymal amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease, is derived from larger amyloid precursor proteins (APP). We have examined the metabolism of APP in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding either wild-type human APP-695 or human APP-695 that harbors the Swedish double mutation associated with familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Although approximately 90% of total soluble APP secreted from wild-type cells is secreted basolaterally following cleavage at the alpha-secretase site, soluble derivatives cleaved near or at the amino terminus of A beta (presumably the beta-secretase site) are preferentially secreted into the apical compartment of SWE cells. Concomitantly, levels of a specific A beta-containing carboxyl-terminal fragment are elevated in SWE cell lysates. Using domain-specific biotinylation and release assays, we failed to detect a beta-secretase-generated soluble derivative (APPs beta) released from the surface of SWE cells. However, APPs beta can be detected in SWE cell lysates, consistent with beta-secretase cleavage occurring in an intracellular compartment. Finally, we demonstrate that A beta is secreted into the basolateral compartment of SWE cells and that the majority of these A beta-related species contains an amino-terminal aspartate residue (+1)."

We report here an investigation of the intrinsic processivity of this enzyme on both natural and homopolymeric DNA templates. Inclusion of the Escherichia coli helix destabilizing protein allowed the viral enzyme, which lacks strand displacement activity, to utilize a singly primed M13 DNA template. In the presence of either 10 mM MgCl2 or 1 mM MgCl2 + 40 mM NaCl, synthesis was achieved in a highly distributive manner. RFII formation required a significant excess of enzyme, and or = 2000 nt were added per binding event. These studies suggest that the catalytic polypeptide of the vaccinia virus DNA polymerase will require accessory protein(s) to form a stable enzyme-template interaction and direct processive DNA synthesis under isotonic conditions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1604605157,"MSF, a mitochondrial import stimulation factor purified from rat liver cytosol, is an ATP-dependent precursor protein conformational modulator. As a step toward understanding the specificity of substrate recognition by MSF, various synthetic peptides were examined for their ability to induce MSF ATPase activity. The peptides corresponding to various mitochondria-targeting signal sequences elicited significant ATPase activity. MSF bound the synthetic mitochondrial signal peptides, and ATP hydrolysis caused dissociation of the peptides from MSF. Basic amino acid residues in the signal peptides seemed to be essential for recognition. Thus, MSF is a member of the polypeptide chain-binding protein family with unique recognition specificity and is distinct from the hsp70 family of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1609919210,"N-Myristyl transferase (Nmt) catalyzes attachment of myristate onto the N terminus of suitable proteins. In order to identify amino acids important for catalytic functions, human Nmt and mutants representing all six conserved cysteine and histidine residues (Cys-169, Cys-214, His-131, His-171, His-218, and His-293) were expressed in Escherichia coli and analyzed for their ability to bind and transfer myristic acid. N-Terminal histidine-tagged fusion proteins displayed varying abilities to form an association with radiolabeled myristic acid indicative of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. When co-expressed with an acceptor substrate protein, pp60v-src, the mutants showed differential incorporation of radiolabeled myristic acid into v-Src protein. In vitro experiments monitoring transfer of myristyl CoA to a peptide homologous to the N terminus of pp60 v-src gave results similar to those obtained in vivo. Our studies showed that mutation at Cys-169, His-171, and especially His-293 interfered with formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate, while human Nmts containing mutations at Cys-169, His-218, or His-293 showed greatly attenuated abilities to form acylated product. We propose a model for the Nmt reaction mechanism in which Cys-169 serves as the fatty acid attachment site for a covalent myristyl enzyme intermediate, while His-171 acts as a general acid/base and His-293 as a specific acid/base during acyl-enzyme intermediate formation. His-218 could then act as an acid or base needed to catalyze transfer of the acyl group from the acyl-enzyme intermediate to a polypeptide substrate. This working model will be useful for the design of regulators of Nmt function."
https://openalex.org/W1580223876,"Active [3H]vinblastine (VBL) transport (efflux) was documented for inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL/VCR-6) resistant to vinca alkaloids and overexpressing MDR 3 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 80-fold. Uptake of [3H]VBL at 37 degrees C by these inside-out vesicles, but not rightside-out vesicles or inside-out vesicles from wild-type cells, was obtained in the form of a rapid, initial phase (0-1 min) and a slower, later phase (> 1 min). The rapidity of each phase correlated with relative P-gp content among different MEL/VCR cell lines. The initial MDR-specific phase was temperature- and pH-dependent (optimum at pH 7), osmotically insensitive, and did not require ATP. The second MDR-specific phase was temperature-dependent, osmotically sensitive, and strictly dependent upon the presence of ATP (Km = 0.37 +/- 0.04 mM). Although other triphosphate nucleotides were partially effective in replacing ATP, the nonhydrolyzable analogue ATP gamma S (adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate)) was ineffective. This time course appears to represent tandem binding of [3H]VBL by P-gp and its mediated transport, with the latter process representing the rate-limiting step. In support of this conclusion, both binding and transport were inhibited by verapamil, quinidine, and reserpine, all known to be inhibitors of photoaffinity labeling of P-gp, but only transport was inhibited by C219 anti-P-gp antibody or orthovanadate. Although the rate of transport of [3H]VBL was 7-7.5-fold lower than the rate of binding (Vmax = 104 +/- 15 pmol/min/mg protein, Kon = 1.5 - 2 x 10(5) mol-1 s-1) to P-gp, each phase exhibited saturation kinetics and values for apparent Km and KD for each process were approximately the same (215 +/- 35 and 195 +/- 30 nM). Intravesicular accumulation of [3H]VBL was almost completely eliminated by high concentrations of nonradioactive VBL, suggesting that simple diffusion does not contribute appreciably to total accumulation of [3H]VBL in this vesicle system. This could be at least partially explained by the fact that these inside-out vesicles under the conditions employed did not maintain a P-gp mediated pH gradient. However, ATP-dependent, intravesicular accumulation of osmotically sensitive [3H]VBL occurred against a substantial permeant concentration gradient in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner consistent with an active, saturable process."

Characterization of the KCl-activated protein kinase activity revealed that it shared similar biochemical and chromatographic properties with the microtubule-associated protein-2 kinase/extracellularly regulated kinase (MAP/ERK) family of protein kinases. This protein kinase activity was found to elute from Mono Q, Superose, and phenyl-Sepharose columns under conditions described for MAP/ERK kinases, and active fractions were found to react with specific antibodies directed against ERKs. The KCl-activated protein kinase was found to phosphorylate the serine 31 site of endogenous bovine adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase. This phosphorylation resulted in an approximately 2-fold activation of tyrosine hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W172044650,"The spermatid-specific nucleoprotamine genes PRM1 and PRM2 and the transition protein gene TNP2 are clustered at a single site on human chromosome 16p13.2. To begin to understand the mechanism governing their genesis and coordinate regulation the primary sequence of this approximately 40.6 kilobase region was determined. This cluster of genes is embedded within a series of repetitive elements, including numerous Alu elements distributed at a frequency of > 1 Alu element/kilobase. Multiple Alu elements have integrated into separate truncated L1 sequences within this region. Many of these Alu elements are tandemly inserted or clustered. The role of repetitive elements in the genomic organization and evolution of this gene cluster is discussed. Computer-assisted sequence analysis revealed the presence of structural sequence elements often associated with the boundary regions of active transcriptional domains. Further analysis identified a CpG island at the 3' end of this segment of chromosome 16 and other candidate coding segments within this region indicative of an additional linked gene. These sequence landmarks are commensurate with the complexity of the region."
https://openalex.org/W1596765055,"We identified two novel heterozygous missense mutations of the insulin receptor gene: the Asp1179 mutation in one family and the Leu1193 mutation in two unrelated families with extreme insulin resistance. In these patients, the number of insulin receptors on the cell surface was found to be markedly decreased by insulin binding and surface labeling studies in transformed lymphocytes. Insulin binding to the transfected COS 7 cells and Rat-1 cells with both mutant cDNAs was also decreased to 5-31% of normal, and the mutant insulin receptors showed a markedly decreased kinase activity. Although biosynthetic labeling studies revealed that both mutant receptors were synthesized as 190-kDa proreceptors, the degradation of the mutant proreceptors was 2-fold faster than that of the wild type proreceptors. However, the degradation rate of the mutant receptors on the cell surface was comparable to that of wild type insulin receptor. These results suggest that the Asp1179 and Leu1193 mutations in the kinase domain are unique in causing decreased insulin receptor number on the cell surface by accelerated intracellular degradation, and that insulin resistance in these patients is mainly due to the decreased receptor number rather than impaired kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1604073843,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration in vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. Growth factor receptor binding protein-2 (GRB2) and Shc have been shown to link growth factor receptor activation with guanine nucleotide exchange on p21-ras. We have examined this pathway in cultures of rat A10 vascular smooth muscle cells. Our data demonstrate that PDGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation on Shc in a concentration- and time-dependent manner that parallels PDGF beta-receptor activation. Immunoprecipitates of Shc from cells exposed to PDGF revealed Shc.GRB2 complexes. Shc immune complexes also contained PDGF beta-receptors. Complex formation was maximal with 30 ng/ml PDGF and peaked within 10 min of exposure. Although PDGF beta-receptors contain a putative GRB2 binding site, activated receptors failed to bind GRB2 directly. Evaluation of Shc from membrane and cytosolic fractions of A10 cells showed little redistribution of Shc following PDGF exposure. Cytosolic Shc bound only GRB2, whereas, membrane-associated Shc complexed with GRB2, the PDGF beta-receptor, Src, and additional tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. We conclude that Shc serves as a primary docking protein for GRB2 in smooth muscle cells and is critical for proliferation in response to PDGF."

The observed oxygen isotopic shifts are used to assign the iron-oxygen stretching (approximately 570 cm-1) and the heretofore unobserved delta (Fe-O-O) bending (approximately 420 cm-1) modes. Although the delta (Fe-O-O) is not enhanced in the case of oxymyoglobin, it is observed for all the hemoglobin derivatives, its exact frequency being relatively invariable among the derivatives. The lack of sensitivity to H2O/D2O buffer exchange is consistent with our previous interpretation of H2O/D2O-induced shifts of v(O-O) in the resonance Raman spectra of dioxygen adducts of cobalt-substituted heme proteins; namely, that those shifts are associated with alterations in vibrational coupling of v(O-O) with internal modes of proximal histidyl imidazole rather than to steric or electronic effects of H/D exchange at the active site. No evidence is obtained for enhancement of the v(Fe-N) stretching frequency of the linkage between the heme iron and the imidazole group of the proximal histidine."

More recently, the reductive half-reaction has also been investigated using a slow substrate, diethylmethylamine, and the reaction also exhibits three kinetic phases (18Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of the kinetic studies with diethylmethylamine, an overall reductive half-reaction mechanism for TMADH has been proposed (15Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): the fast phase represents the two electron reduction of the flavin cofactor (oxidation of the substrate) with simultaneous formation of a covalent substrate-flavin intermediate; the intermediate phase reflects intramolecular electron transfer from reduced flavin to the 4Fe/4S center, generating flavin semiquinone and reduced 4Fe/4S center with intrinsic rapid electron transfer rate limited by the decay of the covalent adduct (15Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and the slow phase involves dissociation of product and binding of a second substrate molecule, which perturbs the electron distribution in the partially reduced enzyme and facilitates formation of the spin-interacting state. Most recently, the reaction with trimethylamine has been re-examined with a considerably slower rate constant for the first phase of the reaction being reported despite the fact that the experiment was performed at 30 °C (19Falzon L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, a kinetic mechanism involving an additional inhibitory substrate-binding site was proposed, although there is no independent evidence for the existence of such an additional substrate binding site. In an effort to clarify the discrepancies concerning the kinetic behavior of TMADH and to further elucidate its reaction mechanism, a comprehensive pH dependence study of the enzyme reaction with trimethylamine has been performed, with particular attention paid to the fast phase of the reaction. By working at 10 °C, we have been able to characterize the substrate concentration and pH dependence of the fast phase of the reaction. We find that this phase is indeed very rapid, with an extrapolated limiting rate constant greater than 1000 s−1 at pH 8.5 and higher, even at 10 °C. Both rapid kinetic and steady-state results can be readily explained by a proposed kinetic mechanism involving two alternative catalytic cycles depending on the relative availability of substrate and electron acceptor. We conclude that the kinetic behavior of the enzyme can be adequately described from a consideration of the known properties of the enzyme without invoking a second substrate-binding site. M. methylotrophusW3A1 was grown on trimethylamine as sole carbon source and TMADH was purified essentially as described by Steenkamp and Mallinson (1Steenkamp D.J. Mallinson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with the exception that Sephacryl S-200 rather than Sephadex G-200 was used for the gel filtration step in the purification. Enzyme concentrations were determined from the 442 nm absorbance of oxidized enzyme using an extinction coefficient of 27.3 mm−1 cm−1 (6Kasprzak A.A. Papas E.J. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The enzyme was found to be stable over the pH range 6–11 used in the present study. Trimethylamine hydrochloride was obtained from Sigma. TMAC was from Aldrich and dried prior to use employing an indirectly heated drying tube containing phosphorous pentoxide in a side chamber. Phosphate and pyrophosphate buffers were obtained from Sigma and boric acid from Jenneile Chemical Co. (inorganic buffers are necessary since most organic buffers contain substituted amines, and either inhibit the enzyme or serve as substrates). Sodium dithionite was from Virginia Chemicals. Phenazine ethosulfate and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol were from Sigma, and benzyl viologen from Aldrich. Kinetic experiments were carried out using a Kinetic Instrument Inc. stopped-flow apparatus equipped with an On-Line Instruments Systems (OLIS) model 3920Z data collection system. Anaerobic solutions of oxidized TMADH were prepared in the following way. A concentrated sample of oxidized enzyme was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 0.1m solution of an appropriate buffer adjusted to the desired pH (phosphate buffer for pH 6.0–7.5, pyrophosphate buffer for pH 8.0–8.5, borate buffer for pH 9.0–11.0). The enzyme solution was then diluted with buffer to give a final concentration of 10–20 μm, placed into a tonometer equipped with a side arm cuvette, and made anaerobic by repeated evacuation and flushing with O2-free argon. Trimethylamine hydrochloride solutions prepared in the same buffer were placed in 20-ml glass syringes and made anaerobic by bubbling with O2-free argon for at least 15 min. Kinetic transients were monitored as transmittance voltages collected by a high speed A/D converter and converted to absorbance changes by OLIS software. All experiments were performed at 10 °C in order to better observe the first kinetic phase of the reaction, and except where specifically discussed below, three well resolved kinetic phases were observed. 500–1000 data points were collected for each kinetic transient and fitted to sums of exponentials using an interactive nonlinear least squares algorithm based on the expression: ΔA(t) = ΣΔA nexp(-kn t) with ΔA n and k n representing the total absorbance change and observed rate constant, respectively. Depending on the observation wavelength and substrate concentration, the kinetic transients were fitted with either a two- or three-exponential expression, as appropriate, and are designated ask fast, k int, and k slow, respectively. At least three independent measurements were performed for each specific experimental condition and the mean and standard derivation calculated using Excel 4.0. Rate constants for each kinetic phase were then plotted versussubstrate concentration. For the fast phase, the hyperbolic substrate concentration dependence was fitted with Equation 2 to obtain the corresponding limiting rate constant (k lim) and dissociation constant (K d) (20Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).kobs=klim·[S]/(Kd+[S])(Eq. 2) pH profiles for the kinetic parametersk lim and k lim/K d were constructed and the data fitted to Equations 3 and 4, respectively, to obtain the relevant pK a values.klim=((EH·(10(−pH)))+(E·(10(−pKa))))/((10(−pH))+(10(−pKa)))(Eq. 3) EH and E being the catalytic activity of the protonated and unprotonated form of the ionization group, respectively.klim/Kd=Tmax/(1+10(pKa1−pH)+10(pH−pKa2))(Eq. 4) T max being the theoretical maximal value of k lim/K d. Kinetic difference spectra were obtained at pH 8.0 over the range 300–600 nm using enzyme and substrate concentrations of 18 and 500 μm, respectively (conditions that ensured adequate kinetic resolution of the three kinetic phases). The spectral change associated with the fast phase of the reaction was corrected for the dead-time of the stopped-flow apparatus (approximately 1.0 ms) (18Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state experiments were performed anaerobically at 10 °C, in 0.1 m pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.0, using a protocol based on the dye-linked assay of Colby and Zatman (21Colby J. Zatman L.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The buffer solution was placed in the side arm cuvette first and made anaerobic by flushing with O2-free argon. Anaerobic phenazine ethosulfate and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol stock solutions were then injected into the side arm cuvette through a rubber septum with gas tight Hamilton syringes to get final concentrations of 2 mm and 100 μm, respectively. Ten microliters of enzyme solution was then injected to give a final concentration of about 40 nm. The reaction was initiated by injection of a concentrated solution of trimethylamine hydrochloride to give the desired final concentration, and followed at 600 nm for the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (Δε = 21.5 mm−1 cm−1) (22Armstrong J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 86: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A single beam diode array spectrophotometer. The observed rate constants were corrected for the slow autoreduction of the dye in the absence of both enzyme and substrate. Oxidized TMADH (in 0.1m pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.0) was mixed with a stoichiometric amount of TMAC to give a final concentration of about 500 μm each. Trace amount of benzyl viologen (0.5 μm) was also included in the reaction mixture to avoid formation of a sulfite adduct during dithionite reduction (15Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme/TMAC solution was placed in a tonometer equipped with a side arm cuvette, made anaerobic by repeated evacuation and flushing with O2-free argon, and then titrated with sodium dithionite to the level of two-electron reduced enzyme. Enzyme samples were removed through the rubber septum using a long needle Hamilton syringe and placed in serum-stoppered quartz EPR tubes which had been previously flushed with O2-free argon. Different amounts of anaerobic buffer were added to the EPR tubes to obtain different concentrations of enzyme and TMAC, ranging from 488 to 10 μm; the samples were then frozen by hand in liquid nitrogen. A separate EPR sample containing 200 μm TMADH and 10 mmtrimethylamine (in which formation of the spin-interacting state was complete) was prepared as an integration standard. X-band EPR spectra were recorded using a Brüker ER 300 EPR spectrometer equipped with a ER035M gaussmeter and a Hewlett-Packard 5352B microwave frequency counter. EPR parameters were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.45 GHz; microwave power, 1.00 mW; modulation amplitude, 10.084 G; temperature, 15 K. Ten scans were taken for each sample to facilitate quantitation of the signals. Relative intensities of EPR signals were determined by the double integration method using Brüker Instruments software. The reductive half-reaction of TMADH with trimethylamine has been studied by stopped-flow spectroscopy at 10 °C over the pH range 6.0–11.0. The reaction is found to consist of three kinetic phases: a fast process followed by two slower ones (hereafter designated fast, intermediate, and slow, respectively). Kinetic transients observed at 450 nm consist principally of the fast kinetic phase throughout the pH range examined here, although a small absorbance change associated with the two slower phases can also be seen (Fig. 1A). The fast phase of the reaction at 10 °C is sufficiently slow as to permit accurate determination of the rate constants for this phase. At 365 nm, the kinetic transients consist essentially of the two slower phases with only a very small spectral change associated with the fast phase (Fig. 1B), while kinetic transients obtained at 520 nm contain substantial contributions from all three kinetic phases (Fig. 1C). Under the pseudo-first order conditions used in the present experiments, the rate constant of the fast phase exhibits a hyperbolic substrate concentration dependence at all pH values examined (data not shown), consistent with the formation of a Michaelis complex between enzyme and substrate prior to bleaching of the flavin (20Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data can be fitted to the hyperbolic equation: k obs =k lim [S]/(K d + [S]) to obtain kinetic parameters k lim and K d (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). The pH dependence of k lim and k lim/K d are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. It is seen that this phase is quite rapid, with extrapolatedk lim values greater than 1000 s−1above pH 8.5 even at 10 °C. 2The dead-time of the stopped-flow apparatus used in the present study is approximately 1.0 ms and it is estimated that about 40–60% of the spectral change associated with the fast kinetic phase of the reaction occurs in the dead-time of the rapid mixing apparatus (depending on the pH and/or substrate concentrations used). Fortunately, with the large spectral changes associated with the fast phase (Δε = 12 mm−1 cm−1), the high enzyme concentrations used in the present study (10–20 μm), and the 2-cm light path of the mixing cell, the observed absorbance change from which k obs has been obtained is in the range 0.06 to 0.3 absorbance units. The reliability of the obtained rate constants are further improved by performing more than three independent measurements under each experimental condition and averaging the results. The pH dependence of k lim, reflecting the progress of the enzyme-substrate complex through the first irreversible step of the reaction (20Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exhibits simple sigmoidal behavior with a single pK a of 7.1 ± 0.2. 3In the accompanying study (33Basran J. Jang M.-H. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13155-13161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) of the Y169F mutant of TMADH, the k lim pH profile was fitted to two pK a values rather than a single pK a, as here. Given the magnitude of the standard error in the present data, we are not able to unambiguously ascertain whether a second pK a exists for this plot. Also, we do not eliminate the possibility here that the pK a, evident in the pH profile for k lim may arise from enzyme-bound substrate. This would require that enzyme bind the protonated form of substrate more tightly than the neutral form, but that the Michaelis constant for the latter break down more rapidly. By contrast, the pH profile of k lim/K d is bell-shaped and a fit using the general equation for such a profile (“Experimental Procedures,” Equation 4) yields pK a values of 9.3 ± 0.1 and 10.0 ± 0.1. Since k lim/K d tracks the reaction of free substrate and free enzyme (20Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the latter pK a value agrees well with that for free trimethylamine (9.81; Ref. 23$$Google Scholar), we thus attribute the latter to the ionization of free substrate and the former to an ionizable group in the enzyme active site. The present results are similar to those obtained previously with diethylmethylamine as substrate, although, significantly, the pK a associated with free substrate was not identified in this earlier work as the data were not extended to sufficiently high pH (18Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the bell-shaped behavior in the k lim/K d plot, we have reexamined the reaction of TMADH with diethylmethylamine to include data for pH 9.5 and 11.0. The results are shown in Fig. 2,C and D, and the ionization of substrate is clearly evident in the pH profile fork lim/K d as the descending limb of the bell-shaped curve at high pH. Several difficulties are associated with analysis of the intermediate phase of the reaction. Below pH 7.0, the spectral change associated with this phase is small at most wavelengths, making it difficult to resolve the two phases (given the large spectral change associated with the fast phase, there is little compromise in the determination of its rate constant). Also, above pH 9.5 the rate constants for the intermediate and slow phases approach each other at high substrate concentrations and prevent reliable determination of rate constants for either phase. As a result, only data over the range pH 7.5–9.5 can be analyzed (the result for pH 8.0 is shown in Fig. 3A). At all pH values examined, the observed rate constant for intermediate phase is substrate concentration dependent, but exhibits a pronounced substrate inhibition pattern. 4There is a potential concern that a portion of the observed kinetic effect might be due to ionic strength effects on the reaction at high substrate concentration. The reductive half-reaction of TMADH with trimethylamine has also been studied at pH 7.5, 10 °C in the presence of 0.2 n potassium chloride and same kinetic behavior is observed as reported here. The maximum apparent rate constant is essentially independent of pH (about 20 s−1). At a given pH, the rate constant decreases as substrate concentration increases (except for pH 7.5 where the rate constant slightly increases as the substrate concentration increases at [TMA] ≤ 500 μm). The degree of apparent substrate inhibition increases with pH, with the concentration required to give a 50% reduction in rate constant decreasing from ∼2 mm at pH 7.5 to ∼0.3 mm at pH 9.5. As with the intermediate phase, it is difficult to obtain reliable rate constants for the slow phase of the reaction. Generally, the magnitude of the spectral change associated with the slow phase decreases as pH increases, and as a result there is poor resolution from the intermediate phase at high pH. Therefore, we were only able to determine the substrate concentration dependence of the slow phase between pH 6.0 and 8.0. The results of the experiment at pH 8.0 are shown in Fig. 3B, where it is evident that the observed rate constant again exhibits substrate inhibition. At each pH, the rate constant increases at low substrate concentrations, then decreases at higher concentrations. The maximum rate constant increases with pH (from ∼0.03 s−1 at pH 6.0 to ∼2 s−1 at pH 8.0) while the substrate concentration that gives the maximum rate constant decreases (ranging from ∼20 mm at pH 6.0 to ∼1 mm at pH 8.0). Inhibition by excess substrate is more dramatic at higher pH, as seen for the intermediate phase. To correlate with the rapid kinetic work, the steady-state kinetic behavior of TMADH with trimethylamine has been studied at pH 8.0, 10 °C. The substrate concentration dependence of initial velocity over a TMA concentration range of 5 μm to 5 mm is shown in Fig. 3C. As seen previously (14Steenkamp D.J. Beinert H. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), excess substrate inhibition is observed with the initial velocity increasing at low substrate concentration (up to approximately 50 μm) and then decreasing as substrate concentration further increases. The concentration at which substrate inhibition is observed, however, is much lower than is the case for the reductive half-reaction experiments described above. The spectral changes associated with each kinetic phase seen in the reductive half-reaction have been determined by stopped-flow spectroscopy with the results shown in Fig. 4. Under the present experimental conditions ([TMADH] = 18 μm, [TMA] = 500 μm, 0.1 m pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10 °C), the three kinetic phases are well resolved (k fast = 500 s−1;k int = 17 s−1;k slow = 1.6 s−1) and the spectral change associated with each phase readily determined. 5The spectral changes associated with each kinetic phases have also been independently determined by kinetic scan using an Applied Photophysics SX.17MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer and the results are essentially identical to those presented here. That for the fast phase agrees well with that reported previously by Beinert and co-workers obtained at pH 7.7 (10Steenkamp D.J. Singer T.P. Beinert H. Biochem. J. 1978; 169: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and is consistent with either true reduction of the flavin cofactor or formation of a substrate-flavin covalent intermediate, as proposed previously (18Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As seen previously with diethylmethylamine (18Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269:"
https://openalex.org/W1606575343,"The gonadotroph-derived alpha T3-1 cell line was used to investigate the effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) upon conventional protein kinase C sub-types (cPKCs) gene expression. Addition of the stable analog [D-Trp6]GnRH (GnRH-A, 0.1 nM) resulted in a rapid increase (30 min) of the steady state levels of PKC beta, but not PKC alpha, mRNA levels, while PKC gamma is not expressed in the cells. The rapid stimulatory effect of GnRH-A was blocked by pretreatment with actinomycin D or with the GnRH antagonist (D-pGlu1, pC1Phe2,D-Trp3,6)GnRH and was not mimicked by thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Addition of the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) resulted also in a rapid (30 min) and selective increase in PKC beta, but not PKC alpha, mRNA levels. In contrast, the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, increased rapidly (30 min) both PKC alpha and PKC beta mRNA levels, and its stimulatory effect on PKC beta was not additive with that of TPA. The rapid stimulatory effect of GnRH-A was blocked by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (GF 109203X) or by down-regulation of endogenous PKC. Similarly, the rapid effect of GnRH-A was abolished by the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) or by removal of extracellular Ca2+. Stimulation of PKC beta mRNA levels by ionomycin was only reduced by GF 109203X and was not affected by down-regulation of PKC. In contrast the effect of TPA on PKC beta mRNA levels was reduced by BAPTA and abolished by removal of Ca2+. We conclude that Ca2+ and PKC act sequentially during GnRH-A-induced PKC beta gene expression and that PKC beta gene expression induced by GnRH-A is autoregulated by PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1532299708,"A site-directed mutagenesis study on the conserved subunit I histidines of the cytochrome bo complex in Escherichia coli identified ligands of the low spin heme B and CuB centers; however, the assignment of the proximal ligand of the high spin heme O was ambiguous (Minagawa, J., Mogi, T., Gennis, R. B., and Anraku, Y. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2096-2104). We have extended this work and characterized the metal centers in the purified histidine mutant oxidases by optical, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopies and by biochemical analysis. We found that the H284A and H333A oxidases contain two heme B molecules, which exhibit the gz = 2.99 low spin and cyanide-sensitive g perpendicular = 6 high-spin EPR signals, whereas the H419A oxidase contains only low spin heme B, which shows the gz component in a considerably higher magnetic field at g = 2.92. The CuB center was partially retained in the H284A oxidase but was almost completely lost in the H333A and H419A oxidases. Thus, we concluded that His419 is the proximal ligand of the high spin heme O and that His284 is located at the distal side of the high spin heme O. His284 plays an indispensable role in maintaining the structure of the Feo-CuB binuclear site suitable for the exogenous ligand bindings in the reduced state, since its substitution eliminated the CO binding activity. In addition, we found that His106 and His421 are in fact the axial ligands of the low spin heme B, although the H421A mutation perturbed the binuclear metal center seriously. Based upon experimental results with isotopic substitutions on iron in the oxidases, we assigned the Raman band at 208 cm-1 to the iron-histidine stretching mode (vFc(2+)-N(His)) of the wild-type ferrous cytochrome o, which was upshifted slightly by a loss of the CuB center in the H333A oxidase. A molecular structure of the metal centers and a possible mechanism of the electron transfer-coupled proton pumping in the cytochrome bo complex are proposed on the basis of our present findings."
https://openalex.org/W1564575583,"Expression of Id, a dominant negative regulator of helix-loop-helix transcription factors, is tightly regulated during cellular differentiation. In this study, we have defined the sequences responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the human Id2A gene. 5' deletion and site-specific mutation analyses of the Id2A promoter showed that both an Sp-1 site and an activating transcription factor (ATF)-like site (referred to as IdATF sites) are required for expression in C2 cells, whereas these sites are not essential for the expression in nonmuscle cells, including HeLa and 10T1/2 cells. Gel shift assays revealed nuclear factors with specific binding to IdATF sites in both C2 and HeLa cells, which are efficiently competed by either legitimate ATF- or AP-1 binding sites. DNA binding activity to IdATF sites was clearly decreased during C2 cell differentiation and rapidly reactivated by treatment with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or serum, which correlated with the induction of endogenous Id2A mRNA expression. In addition, we show that overexpression of the catalytic domain of protein kinase C leads to the activation of the Id2A promoter through IdATF sites in C2 cells. These results suggest a model in which down-modulation of IdATF site binding activity by mitogen depletion contributes to the down-regulation of Id2A gene expression that is essential for myogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1543489149,"Human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a homodimeric cytokine that is a member of a structurally related family of hormones defined by an unusual up-up-down-down alpha-helical bundle. To identify regions on the surface of M-CSF that might interact with the M-CSF receptor, single and double amino acid substitutions were introduced into a truncated form of human M-CSF alpha by site-directed mutagenesis, and the homodimeric M-CSF analogs were purified and characterized. Certain substitutions in the region before and in helix A and in helix C decreased specific bioactivity and correlated with an approximately equivalent reduction in M-CSF receptor affinity. The most dramatic change was observed in an analog in which residues His-9 and His-15 were replaced with alanines, resulting in a 9,100-fold decrease in specific bioactivity. X-ray crystallographic analysis of this M-CSF alpha H9A,H15A analog at a resolution of 2.5 A revealed no significant changes in structure other than the expected new side chains at residues 9 and 15. Analogs containing only one of these two histidine substitutions exhibited a decrease in specific bioactivity of 6- and 1200-fold for the H9A and H15A mutations, respectively. It appears that selected amino acids in the NH2-terminal region of M-CSF and possibly portions of the surface formed by helices A and C are significantly involved in interactions with the M-CSF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1562415856,"The complete amino acid sequence of winged bean basic agglutinin (WBA I) was obtained by a combination of manual and gas-phase sequencing methods. Peptide fragments for sequence analyses were obtained by enzymatic cleavages using trypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 endoproteinase and by chemical cleavages using iodosobenzoic acid, hydroxylamine, and formic acid. COOH-terminal sequence analysis of WBA I and other peptides was performed using carboxypeptidase Y. The primary structure of WBA I was homologous to those of other legume lectins and more so to Erythrina corallodendron. Interestingly, the sequence shows remarkable identities in the regions involved in the association of the two monomers of E. corallodendron lectin. Other conserved regions are the double metal-binding site and residues contributing to the formation of the hydrophobic cavity and the carbohydrate-binding site. Chemical modification studies both in the presence and absence of N-acetylgalactosamine together with sequence analyses of tryptophan-containing tryptic peptides demonstrate that tryptophan 133 is involved in the binding of carbohydrate ligands by the lectin. The location of tryptophan 133 at the active center of WBA I for the first time subserves to explain a role for one of the most conserved residues in legume lectins."
https://openalex.org/W1567022905,"These studies characterize the mechanisms involved in terminating the initial Ca2+ transient stimulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). When TRH was added to GH3 pituitary cells that had been treated with thapsigargin to block any agonist-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i, TRH caused a decrease in [Ca2+]i. The Ca2+ clearing response was seen in pituitary GH3 cells and in nonexcitable HEK 293 cells transfected with TRH receptor cDNA, was evident at basal or elevated [Ca2+]i, and was mediated by the TRH receptor. The Ca2+ clearing response to TRH was not prevented by thapsigargin, Ca2+ ionophores, nimodipine, or replacement of extracellular Na+ but was inhibited by La3+. La3+ also increased the duration of the TRH-evoked [Ca2+]i transient. TRH-stimulated Ca2+ extrusion was directly demonstrated using extracellular fluo-3 free acid. TRH produced a 5-20-fold increase in Ca2+ efflux that was independent of extracellular Na+ and inhibited by vanadate. TRH stimulation of Ca2+ efflux was not reproduced by phorbol esters or inhibited by down-regulation of protein kinase C or staurosporine. The results suggest that agonist-activated Ca2+ efflux may be a universal component of an agonist-activated Ca2+ response and further suggest that a plasma membrane Ca2+ pump may be an effector for G-protein-coupled receptors linked to Ca2+ mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W1879663808,"Abstract The CREB/ATF family of dimeric basic/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors have been implicated in signal transduction by several agents including intracellular cAMP. The ubiquity of the cAMP-signaling pathway in mammalian cells has made it difficult to assay individual family members in their native form and dissect their roles in signal transduction. In light of observations that ATF1 exhibits several cell-specific characteristics and is allosterically regulated, the above problem has represented a particular limitation for studying ATF1. To address this we have exploited the modular nature of the bZIP domain to design fusion proteins that closely resemble native ATF1 but have altered DNA binding and dimerization specificity. The activity of these novel proteins can be monitored following their introduction into a cAMP-responsive cell type. Thus we describe an assay for members of the CREB family that should be generally applicable in a range of cell types and to other bZIP protein families."

Here we report that GNT has been purified to apparent homogeneity from mouse kidney by means of preparation of a microsomal fraction, solubilization with Triton X-100, and sequential column chromatographies on CM-Sepharose, UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose, and Gg4Ose-Aminocellulo-fine. GNT purified 11,000-fold from the microsomal fraction exhibited a specific activity of 26.15 mumol/min/mg protein and an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Km values for UDP-GlcNAc and GL-X were 0.36 and 0.11 mM, respectively. Among glycolipids tested as substrates, GL-X was the best and Gg4Cer the next best, but Lc3Cer, Gb4Cer, and GM1 did not act as a substrate. GNT was also able to transfer GlcNAc to Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-benzyl and Gal beta 1-3GalNAc alpha 1-p-nitrophenyl at C-6 of GalNAc through beta linkage but not to GlcNAc beta-3GalNAc alpha 1-p-nitrophenyl. The purified GNT was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and four peptides generated were sequenced. The sequence of four peptides spanning 35 amino acid residues in total exhibited 80% homology with that of the reported human core 2 GlcNAc transferase."
https://openalex.org/W1592071944,"The Hin recombinase exists as a homodimer in solution and binds to its recombination site (hix) as a dimer (Glasgow, A. C., Bruist, M. F., and Simon M. I. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 10072-10082). Previous mutational and structural studies of related proteins suggested the location of a putative dimerization domain. In order to probe the function of this region of the protein, cysteine residues were introduced at each of the seven positions comprising the domain. Proteins containing cysteine substitutions at positions 101 and 104 were able to form disulfide bonds spontaneously in crude extracts. M101C showed wild type inversion activity only if the cysteine residue was not engaged in a disulfide bond. This mutant, which is cross-linked by a disulfide bond at the dimeric interface, was found to be defective in the DNA cleavage step during inversion. H107C displayed the wild type DNA cleavage activity, even though its DNA binding activity was not detected by three different binding assays. This suggests that it maintains specificity for DNA binding but dissociates rapidly after binding. The remaining inversion-defective mutants fell into two groups. One group lost its capacity to specifically bind to DNA (G102C, F105C, and F106C), and the other group (R103C and F104C), while able to bind to DNA, was defective in subsequent steps of the inversion reaction. Characteristics of these mutants led me to postulate that movement of subunits at the dimerization interface is critical during DNA binding and during formation of the invertasome, which is the recombination structure. Furthermore, the relative position of subunits within the dimer may be important for maintaining stable DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1607956798,"Abstract The thermoacidophilic archaebacterium Sulfolobus acidocaldarius possesses a very unusual terminal oxidase. We report original kinetic experiments on membranes of this microorganism carried out by stopped flow, using time-resolved optical spectroscopy combined with singular value decomposition analysis. The reduced-oxidized kinetic difference spectrum of the Sulfolobus membranes is characterized by three significant peaks in the visible region at 605, 586, and 560 nm. The 605-nm peak and part of the 586-nm peak (cytochrome aa3-type quinol oxidase) are reduced synchronously by both ascorbate plus N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylendiamine (TMPD) and dithionite, and they are very rapidly oxidized by molecular oxygen. A second pool of cytochromes seems to contribute to the 586-nm peak which is not reduced by ascorbate plus TMPD and reacts very slowly with dithionite. The b-type cytochromes (560 nm peak) are reduced by both reductants and are essentially non-autoxidizable at room temperature. Only one CO binding site with spectral features, kinetic properties, and ligand affinity not very dissimilar from those of mammalian cytochrome oxidase can be detected in the ascorbate-reduced membranes. On the contrary, a second CO binding site having unusual properties for aa3 terminal oxidases can be detected in the dithionite-reduced membranes."
https://openalex.org/W154725645,"Bacteriophage T4 encodes its own aerobic ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which reduces ribonucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates. T4 RNR is composed of homodimeric large (R1) and small (R2) subunits. Intricate regulation of enzymatic activity is accomplished by the binding of nucleotide effectors to R1. Berglund (Berglund, O. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 7270-7275) described similarities between T4 RNR and the corresponding enzyme from aerobic Escherichia coli. An important difference, however, is that T4 RNR forms a tight R1.R2 complex, while the E. coli R1 and R2 more readily dissociate. In this study we purified the phage R2 subunit from an overexpression vector constructed by Tseng et al. (Tseng, M., Hilfinger, J., He, P., and Greenberg, R. (1992) J. Bacteriol. 174, 5740-5744) and used this as an immunogen to generate polyclonal antiserum. Using co-immunoprecipitation techniques, we probed in vitro for interactions between the phage-induced R1 and R2 subunits. Our studies indicate that tight binding of the phage RNR subunits is completely dependent upon the known allosteric effectors of the enzyme. Once the R1.R2 holoenzyme has been formed it appears to be remarkably stable when in the presence of dATP. However, if dATP is removed, the R1.R2 complex readily dissociates."
https://openalex.org/W1603280333,"The amino acid sequence 256-275 of the human thyrotropin (TSH) receptor extracellular domain has previously been shown to participate in a high affinity TSH binding site by a synthetic peptide approach as well as by site-directed mutagenesis. To further investigate this binding site, we synthesized a series of peptides with alanine substitutions for each residue in the native sequence. Peptides were also synthesized containing truncations or deletions of the native sequence. Each peptide was tested for its ability to inhibit 125I-bTSH binding to porcine thyroid membrane preparations, and the concentration at which 50% inhibition of binding occurred was determined (EC50). Alanine substitution at residues Tyr258, Cys262, Cys263, Phe265, Lys266, Asn267, Lys269, Lys270, and Arg272 all resulted in statistically significant decreases in activity when compared to the native sequence (p"
https://openalex.org/W1555565452,"Escherichia coli adenylyl cyclase contains no sequence that corresponds to the previously defined ATP/GTP binding consensus (A,G)XXXXGK(S,T). Using a search for lysine residues located adjacent to glycine residues, three regions that were possible candidates for part of the ATP binding site were identified. These were the residues located at positions 59, 90, and 196. A plasmid vector capable of overexpressing the cya gene under the control of the lambda PL promoter was mutated at these three loci to convert those lysine residues to methionine. Assays for catalytic activity of the mutated hyperexpressed proteins revealed that only the mutation at position 196 led to loss of activity. Photoaffinity labeling experiments using 8-azido-ATP provided evidence that the loss of activity was associated with a loss of the capability of the enzyme to bind ATP. A further series of replacement mutations in the hyperexpression vector was created at position 196. Assays of the adenylyl cyclase activity of the mutated proteins showed that replacement of lysine 196 by arginine led to minimal change in the activity. Replacements by histidine, glutamine, or glutamic acid resulted in approximately 10-20-fold reductions in the activity; replacements by methionine, isoleucine, or aspartic acid resulted in total loss of activity. When the mutated forms of the cya gene were expressed under the control of the cya promoter, the activity of the wild-type protein was higher than that of all the mutants, including the arginine replacement mutant. All of the mutants that retained activity also retained the capability of adenylyl cyclase to be stimulated by either inorganic orthophosphate or GTP. A helical wheel analysis of the region of adenylyl cyclase around lysine 196 revealed a structure compatible with an amphipathic helix with one face enriched with basic amino acid residues. Assays for adenylyl cyclase activity of a series of replacement mutations of residues on the hydrophilic face of the helix (R188I, R192I, G195I) as well as on the hydrophobic face (R197I) indicated that the R188I, G195I, and K196I replacement mutants were inactive, and R192I was approximately 30% as active as the wild-type, while the R197I mutant was equivalent to the wild-type control. A model is suggested for a unique binding motif in E. coli adenylyl cyclase in which there is a repetition of 3 basic residues on one face of a helix where there is an interaction with the three phosphate groups of ATP."
