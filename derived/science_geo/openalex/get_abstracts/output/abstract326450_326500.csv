https://openalex.org/W2062030094,"Crushed quartz was subjected to wind, ball mill, and shaking-table action to simulate eolian and beach conditions. Electron microphotographs of these surfaces were then compared with those of grain surfaces which had been frosted naturally, and the correspondence between them was good. Thus, the transportation history of many sand deposits may be identified by this technique."
https://openalex.org/W2056008120,"The structures of the clay minerals are reasonably well known, but greater detail and more precision are needed if the properties of clays and soils are to be fully understood. For example, the selective adsorptive and catalytic properties and the reaction with organic materials vary with the character of the clay mineral, but the structural factors that control such properties are not well understood. Research is urgently needed on the structure of pure clay minerals and on the reactions of pure clay minerals with organic and inorganic materials. Much past research on clay-mineral reactions has little fundamental value because the clay that was used was composed of a mixture of minerals which were not well characterized. It is not a simple matter to find pure samples of many of the clay minerals, and to a considerable extent progress depends on finding such pure minerals or preparing them in the laboratory."

https://openalex.org/W2037058205,"The vacuum-oven technique for quantitative sorption of a glycerol duointerlayer by montmorillonite at 35 degrees C is adapted to 130 degrees C to obtain a mono-inter-layer of glycerol, glycerol vapor relative pressure being controlled by temperature differential. Values obtained for montmorillonite agree closely with theoretical values based on liquid glycerol density, while vermiculite retains a mono-interlayer of somewhat less than liquid glycerol density."
https://openalex.org/W2048087628,"Tobacco is protected from fleck, caused by high concentrations of atmospheric ozone, by enclosing groups of the plants completely in tents of cloth treated with the antiozonant 4,4'-dioctyl diphenylamine in butyl latex. The treated cloth also reduces the amount of fleck on adjacent, unenclosed plants. Spraying the antiozonant on the walls of a previously untreated tent prevents subsequent flecking of plants within the tent."

https://openalex.org/W2139305284,"Plant fossils, including branched axes, foliar structures, fructifications, and dispersed spores have recently been discovered from the type section of the Ghost River formation. The megafossils, although commonly fragmentary, suggest a late Middle or early Upper Devonian age for the beds. This discovery suggests that equivalent strata in other regions may also contain plant remains, the discovery of which would add significantly to our knowledge of Devonian floras in western North America."
