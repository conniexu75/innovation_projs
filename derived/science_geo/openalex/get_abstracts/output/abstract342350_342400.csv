https://openalex.org/W2085182293,"Phytoremediation, a strategy of using plants to remediate site contaminated with toxic materials, is growing in interest. This article describes phytoremediation methods and current research in the field. Most of the active interest is in removing metals mainly because much less is known about how plants handle organic contaminants such as oils and cleaning fluids. Sites being investigated include abandoned mines with zinc and lead contamination; military sites with lead and cadmium; municipal waste dumps with copper, mercury, and lead; sewage sludge dump sites. Tropical plans seem to predominate in the field but other plants are also showing promise."

https://openalex.org/W2032039629,"Present-day (1967 to 1969) fluxes of alpha particles from solar cosmic rays, determined from satellite measurements, were used to calculate the production rates of cobalt-57, cobalt-58, and nickel-59 in lunar surface samples. Comparisons with the activities of nickel-59 (half-life, 8 Ã— 10 4 years) measured in lunar samples indicate that the long-term and present-day fluxes of solar alpha particles are comparable within a factor of approximately 4."
https://openalex.org/W2054388353,"The shift of the Yukon River, during the Holocene sea-level transgression, from south of Nunivak Island during the Wisconsin maximum to its present location (a distance greater than 300 kilometers) is indicated by remanent channels, distinct subbottom structures, deltaic sediments, and anomalous rates of sediment accumulation on the continental shelf of the east-central Bering Sea. These features were produced as the ancestral river migrated northward across the easternmost part of this area before 11,000 years ago."
