https://openalex.org/W2123164383,"Binding of glucocorticoids and related steroids to rat thymus cells in vitro has been measured by equilibrium and kinetic methods. Results are interpreted in terms of the previously established specific and nonspecific metabolic activities of glucocorticoids. Equilibrium binding, which is proportional to nonspecific activity, is largely accounted for kinetically by a fraction which at 37° dissociates with a time constant under 15 sec. A minor fraction, with a time constant of about 3 min, appears to consist of molecules responsible for specific glucocorticoid activity. This slowly dissociating or specific fraction becomes bound rapidly enough to account for the fastest glucocorticoid effects so far observed. In contrast to the rapidly dissociating or nonspecific fraction it becomes saturated at physiological concentrations, it depends on cellular ATP levels, and it is competed for by all steroids tested in rough proportion to glucocorticoid activity. Chromatographic analysis indicated that the specific fraction probably consists entirely of unaltered cortisol, adding to the evidence that the hormonally active form of cortisol is cortisol itself. The 9α-fluoro group increases specific binding, and possibly intrinsic activity. The 11β-hydroxyl, 17α-hydroxyl, and 4-ene-3-ketone groups also increase binding whereas the 11-ketone and 11α-hydroxyl groups decrease binding. Certain steroids that lack glucocorticoid activity nevertheless compete for specific binding. Antiglucocorticoid activity on glucose uptake in vitro has been shown with cortexolone."

This phenomenon can be used to isolate mechanisms responsive to bars of a given width. Our results suggest that the human visual system contains several different classes of size detectors, each maximally sensitive to visual targets with sizes in a particular range."
https://openalex.org/W1589591585,"Abstract A procedure for the precise determination of the d and l isomers in a given sample of an amino acid has been based upon chromatographic separation of the diastereoisomeric dipeptides obtained by derivatization with an l-amino acid N-carboxyanhydride. The conditions for the preparation of dipeptides developed by Hirschmann and associates make the derivatization step simple and rapid; the coupling proceeds at pH 10.4 in 2 min in about 90% yield. For each of 21 individual amino acids conditions of elution have been found for the separation of the resulting pairs of l-d and l-l dipeptides by ion exchange chromatography on an amino acid analyzer. One part of d-amino acid can be detected in the presence of 1000 parts of the l isomer with 2-µmole samples. With a mixture of amino acids, a given component can be isolated chromatographically for subsequent determination of the d to l ratio or chromatographic separation of the dipeptides prepared by derivatization of the mixture can be undertaken. If the mixture is a hydrolysate of a peptide or a protein, the degree of racemization occurring during acid hydrolysis must also be considered. For this purpose hydrolysates of synthetic bradykinin and of pancreatic ribonuclease have been examined. The amounts of several d-amino acids (0.2 to 4.4%) determined in the hydrolysates were not significantly higher than those found in control experiments when the pure l-amino acids or l-l dipeptides were subjected to the hydrolytic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1555026145,"Two glycosyltransferases were detected in a particulate preparation from 13-day-old embryonic chicken brain. The first enzyme transferred glucose from UDP-glucose to ceramide to give ceramide-glucose, while the second transferred galactose from UDP-galactose to ceramide-glucose to give a product partially characterized as ceramide-lactose. These enzymatic steps, in addition to those previously described in embryonic chicken brain, delineate a pathway for the synthesis of disialoganglioside from ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W2001325153,To prevent adverse effects on human health as exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) increases adequate programs and policies must be adopted. Their formulation will require deliberate scientific judgment based on adequate information and the consideration of certain hypotheses which are reviewed here. Exposures to CO are widespread. For the U.S. urban population cigarette smoking is probably the most important source followed in importance by motor vehicle exhaust occupational sources and home heating and cooking devices. The median carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) concentration for those who smoke 1 pack of cigarettes daily and who inhale is 5.9% - a concentration sufficient to imply a serious threat to health in persons with underlying vascular insufficiency. This level of exposure may be responsible for some of the excess mortality from cardiovascular disease observed among cigarette smokers. Community air pollution may produce COHb concentrations in nonsmokers similar to those observed in smokers and the effects of these concentrations will be greater at high altitude. There has been considerable documentation of endogenous production of CO from home catabolism. Such production provides a tool for the study of hemolytic disorders is a hazard to infants in respirators and to men in submersibles and space capsules and may increase the risk of closed-circuit anesthesia. Low and commonly occurring CO exposures may impair accurate estimation of time intervals as well as the performance of more complex psychomotor tasks. A possible role of CO in motor vehicle accidents is suggested by data showing higher levels of COHb in drivers involved in accidents than in policemen and in other occupationally exposed populations.(AUTHORS MODIFIED)
https://openalex.org/W1569504000,"Abstract A particulate preparation from embryonic chicken brain was previously described that catalyzed the transfer of sialic acid from CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid to galactosyl → glucosyl → ceramide to give a monosialoganglioside, sialyl → galactosyl → glucosyl → ceramide (Reaction A). In the present studies, two monosialogangliosides served as acceptors in similar reactions, giving the corresponding disialogangliosides (Reactions B and C). Reaction B yields the major disialoganglioside of human brain; the acceptor is a ceramide-pentasaccharide containing a terminal galactose residue, and the sialic acid is transferred to this galactose unit. Reaction C involves the synthesis of N-acetylneuraminyl → N-glycolylneuraminyl → galactosyl → glucosyl → ceramide, where the terminal sialic acid is linked at C-8 to the N-glycolylneuraminic acid. The sialyl → sialyl unit occurs in brain tri- and tetrasialogangliosides, and in the minor disialogangliosides. Reaction B represents the last step in the synthesis of the major disialogangliosides from ceramide according to a proposed pathway, while Reaction C represents a branch in the pathway, and may be a key step in the synthesis of the minor disialogangliosides, and of the tri- and tetrasialogangliosides. Kinetic studies indicate that Reactions A, B, and C are catalyzed by different sialyltransferases in the particulate fraction."

https://openalex.org/W1533070343,"Abstract A modified method for the purification of serine transhydroxymethylase from rabbit liver is presented. The purified enzyme is not only shown to catalyze the cleavage of serine but in addition, the cleavage of l-threonine and dl-allothreonine to glycine and acetaldehyde. The last two reactions had previously been thought to have been catalyzed by two separate enzymes, i.e. threonine aldolase and allothreonine aldolase. The evidence in support of a single enzyme catalyzing the three reactions includes the constant ratio for the specific activities during purification, similarity in affinity constants for substrates and inhibitors, and the ability of d-alanine to remove pyridoxal phosphate from the active site by transamination for both the allothreonine and serine reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1980643034,"A fossil record of lampreys has previously been unknown. A new genus demonstrates the presence of this group in the Pennsylvanian. The body outline, parts of the head skeleton, rasping tongue mechanism, gill basket, and other internal organs are preserved. The fossils are very similar in structure to modern forms. The absence of hagfish characters in the fossil supports the view that the common ancestor of lampreys and hagfishes lived prior to the Pennsylvanian."

The locus responsible for this behavioral variation is located in Linkage Group VIII of the mouse. Sensitization-dependent convulsions are influenced in whole or in part by alleles at an independent locus.

Ventral root reflexes evoked by A-fibers were facilitated by a pure C-volley in the same or another nerve, but dorsal root potentials evoked by A-fibers were reduced by isolated dorsal root potentials from C-fibers. In the absence of anesthetics, single C-volleys produced brisk and prolonged reflex discharges in ventral roots."
https://openalex.org/W1526456140,"Multichain polyprolines of either optical configuration, prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide from polylysine and N-carboxyproline anhydride, served as intermediates in the synthesis of a series of polymers of the general formulas, poly(Tyr, Glu)-polyPro-polyLys and poly(Phe, Glu)-poly-Pro-polyLys, in which the amino acids appear in different optical configurations. The various multichain copolymers obtained were used to elucidate whether, and to what extent, the optical configuration of the component amino acids in a macromolecule contributes to its immunogenicity and affects the relative immunopotency of different regions within the molecule. Multichain polyprolines of either optical configuration did not provoke antibody formation in rabbits, even though poly L Pro-poly L Lys was immunogenic in guinea pigs. Attachment of short peptides composed of ( L Tyr, L Glu) or ( L Phe, L Glu) to each of them led to materials provoking a strong immune response in rabbits. Thus, the attachment of as little as 8.5% of L -amino acid residues on the outside of a macromolecule composed exclusively of D -amino acids converted it into a good immunogen. The specificity of the antibodies formed was directed mainly to the peptides attached. Materials obtained upon attachment of short peptides of ( D Tyr, D Glu) or ( D Phe, D Glu) to either multichain poly- D -proline or poly- L -proline did not lead to a detectable immune response in rabbits when the usual high dose was used for immunization, but were weakly immunogenic at low dosage. Thus, a macromolecule containing as much as 95.5% of L -amino acids, but having all its polymeric side chains terminating in D -amino acids, is as poor an immunogen as a similar macromolecule composed exclusively of D -amino acids. It is suggested that this is due to the lack of endopeptidases capable of splitting peptide bonds between two L -proline residues, and that proteolysis may play a role in antibody biosynthesis, even though not at the stage of antigenic “recognition” but rather as a step in the control of the rate at which antibodies are formed. Whereas antigens containing L -peptides on the outside led mainly to antibodies specific toward these peptides, antigens containing D -peptides on the outside caused mainly the formation of stereospecific antibodies against the polyproline moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1617439983,"Abstract The phosphatases of rat liver lysosomes have been fractionated chromatographically. One of these enzymes has been characterized as a nucleotidase of broad specificity, acting equally well on most 2'-, 3'-, and 5'-nucleotides. Evidence is presented regarding its substrate specificity, stability, and pH optimum, and the effects of inorganic and organic compounds on its activity are presented. Sucrose gradient centrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and other procedures suggest that the preparation is homogeneous with respect to phosphatase activity. The broad specificity of the enzyme toward the nucleotides tested suggests that it may play a key role in the degradation of intermediates in the lysosomal catabolism of nucleic acids and their components."
https://openalex.org/W1991913014,"Traditional studies of electrophysiological correlates of behavior contain inherent high variability resulting from the arbitrary choice of behaviors, brain locations, and wave parameters. The operant control of neural events is a formal and systematic approach to the study of prespecified parameters and components of brain activity as they encode behaviors. Two studies in which the electrical activity of brain was the criterion for reinforcement demonstrate the acquisition, under such operant control, of two mutually exclusive behaviors or states which selectively alter evoked potential components."

https://openalex.org/W1603370972,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate:uridine-5'-diphospho-N-acetyl-2-amino-2-deoxyglucose-3-enolpyruvyltransferase, an enzyme which transfers enolpyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate to uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) with the liberation of inorganic orthophosphate was purified 326-fold from Enterobacter cloacae NRC 492. The transferase was free of UDP-GlcNAc-enolpyruvate reductase, an enzyme which catalyzes the reduction of UDP-GlcNAc-enolpyruvate to form uridine-5'-diphospho-N-acetylmuramic acid. The enzyme was specific for the indicated substrates, and the optimum pH range for the reaction was from pH 6.7 to pH 7.4. The reaction was reversible as judged by radioactive inorganic orthophosphate exchange. The Km for phosphoenolpyruvate was 3 x 10-5 m and that for UDP-GlcNAc was 4.6 x 10-4 m. The available data suggest that the enzyme requires thiol group(s) for its activity. The energy of activation of the enzyme, calculated from the Arrhenius plot, was 15 kcal per mole. Pure UDP-GlcNAc-enolpyruvate has been prepared in milligram quantities. The hydrolysis of this nucleotide in 1 m HCl at 100° liberated 1 mole of pyruvate per mole of uridine. Hydrogenation of the nucleotide followed by hydrolysis in 6 n HCl at 100° resulted in the liberation of muramic acid. On the basis of its chemical properties and infrared and ultraviolet absorption studies, the nucleotide has been characterized as uridine-5'-diphospho-N-acetyl-2-amino-2-deoxy-3-enolpyruvylglucose. Infrared and ultraviolet absorption spectra are given."

https://openalex.org/W1607281987,"Kinase-activating factor, a protein required for the activation of phosphorylase b kinase by Ca++, was purified from brain tissue and from skeletal muscle and myocardium. All fractions contained calcium-activated proteinase activity as measured by the formation of acid-soluble, tyrosine-positive material with casein as substrate. The ratio of kinase-activating factor activity to proteinase activity remained constant throughout the purification, and both activities coincided on Sephadex G-100 filtration. Kinase-inhibitory factor, which prevents activation of kinase by Ca++, inhibited proteinase activity. Kinase-inhibitory factor also prevented the activation of kinase by trypsin. Acid-soluble, ninhydrin-positive material was formed during the activation of phosphorylase kinase by kinase-activating factor in the presence of Ca++. It is concluded that kinase-activating factor is a calcium-activated proteolytic enzyme, that kinase-inhibitory factor is a proteolytic inhibitor, and that activation of phosphorylase b kinase by Ca++ involves proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1480307008,"Abstract An enzyme activity responsible for the formation of 5'-phosphoribosylamine from ribose 5-phosphate and a nitrogen donor was prepared from livers of ducks, chickens, and pigeons. This enzyme activity is distinct from ribosylpryophosphate 5-phosphate amidotransferase (EC 2.4.2.14), which catalyzes the formation of 5'-phosphoribosylamine from ribosylpyrophosphate 5-phosphate and glutamine. The enzyme was partially purified and completely separated from ribosylpyrophosphate 5-phosphate amidotransferase. For maximal synthesis of 5'-phosphoribosylamine, the reaction required ribose 5-phosphate, ammonium chloride, ATP, and magnesium ions. Prolonged heating at 80° destroyed the activity of the enzyme. It is proposed that an alternate pathway for the initial step of purine synthesis exists, namely, the direct conversion of ribose 5-phosphate to 5'-phosphoribosylamine. This reaction is enzymatic and is sensitive to inhibition by ribonucleotides and by ribose 5-phosphate."

This result contrasts with that reported by others for animals given massive exposures to various dusts for short periods of time. Because the concentrations of lead were comparable to those observed in some industrial(150 microg/m(3)) or urban (10 microg/m(3)) environmental conditions, the results may be significant in terms of human lung clearance processes after such exposures."
https://openalex.org/W1778449634,"Abstract Thyrocalcitonin has been isolated from porcine thyroid tissue following a 40,000-fold purification. Specific biological activity is 200 MRC units per mg. The purified peptide was shown to be homogenous by multiple criteria and to consist of 32 amino acids: Arg2, His1, Thr2, Ser4, Glu1, Pro2, Gly3, Ala1, Val1, Met1, Asn4, Leu3, Phe3, Tyr1, Trp1, half-Cys2. The purified hormone is resolved by chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose or cellulose thin layer plates into two components. The only difference between these components is that one form of the hormone contains methionine as the sulfoxide; the other component, methionine in the reduced form. Both forms have equal specific activity. The peptide contains no covalently bound carbohydrate, iodine, or other substituted amino acids. The 2 half-cystine residues are present in the hormone as an intrachain disulfide bond. Since 1 half-cystine residue is the NH2-terminal amino acid, the amino-terminal portion of the molecule is in the form of a 23-membered ring. The lack of a high degree of ordered structure in the molecule is reflected in the complete solvent accessibility of the methionine, tryptophan, and tyrosine residues without prior denaturation of the polypeptide."

https://openalex.org/W2063471926,Direct in vivo estimates of DNA synthesis time in early and late erythroblasts were obtained by using the H3- and C14-thymidine double-labeling technique. A double-emulsion autoradiographic procedure was used to resolve the two isotopes. Early erythroblasts were found to proliferate at a rate about five times that of late cells. This results primarily from a shorter mean DNA synthesis time in early cells (2.5 hours) than in late cells (6.5 hours).
https://openalex.org/W1591196429,"Abstract The reversible binding to fumarase of the competitive inhibitors, trans-aconitate and citrate, and of the natural substrates, fumarate and l-malate, was studied by the method of equilibrium dialysis. The binding of the enol tautomer of oxalacetate, a secondary substrate of fumarase, was measured spectrophotometrically. The results of these studies indicate that there are four substrate- or inhibitor-binding sites per tetrameric molecule of enzyme, or an average of one site per polypeptide chain subunit. The Michaelis constants (Km) and inhibition constants (Ki) for these compounds were found to be in close agreement with the dissociation constants calculated from the binding studies. This correspondence strongly suggests that the four binding sites measured are also catalytic sites."

https://openalex.org/W1529203625,"β-Methylaspartase, known to possess a tetrameric quaternary structure, has been studied to determine whether or not its subunits are identical. The binding of mesaconate to enzyme was studied by the technique of gel filtration. The ratio of moles of mesaconate bound per mole of enzyme was 1.6, indicating the presence of two binding sites per tetramer. Tryptic peptide maps showed 55 ninhydrin-positive spots, corresponding to half the sum of lysine and arginine residues per tetramer. Column chromatography of a tryptic digest of β-methylaspartase, maximally labeled on its 16 thiol groups with N-ethylmaleimide-1-14C, yielded eight fractions of equal radioactivity. Amino acid analysis of one of these fractions showed it to possess a single half-cystine derivative. On the basis of these data and the established fact that β-methylaspartase possesses two essential thiol groups per tetramer, it is proposed that the enzyme contains two A and two B subunits. The dimer structure is presumed to be A-B. Differential labeling of the catalytically essential thiol group, followed by enzymatic digestion and isolation, yielded a reactive cysteine peptide for which the amino acid composition was determined. No disulfide bridges were found by the diagonal electrophoresis technique."

On occasion, however, pollution effects may persist long enough so that the atmosphere or the ocean circulation may spread them over the whole earth.

It is therefore important to examine the situation at frequent intervals to determine whether a pollutant released in our environment could have far-ranging geophysical effects or far-ranging effects in the biosphere, and to probe particularly all interconnections in order to expose any weak link in the ecological chain. Such an examination should involve scientists from different specialties, including geophysics, geology, biochemistry, biology, medicine, and ecology.
