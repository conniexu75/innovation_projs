Because this substance moved on paper chromatograms more slowly than the recognized a-amino acids’ and because of its ready destruction by chloramine-T, the tentative conclusion was reached that hydrolysis of this toxin liberated a previously unknown amino acid. The object of this paper is t,o describe the isolation of this new amino acid in pure form and to tell of the determination of its structure as a, E-diamino-fl-hydroxypimelic acid. Because this amino acid is contained within the toxin of P. tabaci, the short, trivial name tabtoxinine is proposed for it. The structure was established in the following manner. Elementary analyses showed that the isolated substance corresponded to the formula C,H1406N2. Aqueous solutions of it were neutral. Measurement of carbon dioxide evolved showed that practically all the nitrogen was estimable by the decarboxylation procedure with ninhydrin, and this behavior strongly indicated that the nitrogen atoms were present as amino groups situated (Y to carboxyl groups. These facts suggested that the new compound was a hydroxydiaminopimelic acid, and this seemed to correlate well with its migration on paper strips. Work (2) has recently described the isolation of a!, E-diaminopimelic acid from hydrolysates of the diphtheria bacillus, and has shown that it migrates slowly on paper strips developed with phenol.’ The finding t,hat our new compound (which differed in empirical formula from that of Work by only 1 oxygen atom) moved even more slowly (RF 0.10 in phenol saturated with water) was enough t’o suggest that it might be a hydroxydiaminopimelic acid. This proved to be the case. The position of the hydroxyl group was established as being adjacent to one of the amino groups by the use of sodium periodate. This reagent rapidly destroyed the new amino acid and 1 equivalent of periodate was consumed in the process. After this reaction a small amount of a sub-"

Xo variation in RNAP content could there- fore be related to the protein synthesis that follows pilocarpine adminis- tration. The bearing of these results on previous histochemical data is discussed.
