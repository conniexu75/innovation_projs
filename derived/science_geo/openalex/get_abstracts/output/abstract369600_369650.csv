https://openalex.org/W2099915768,"In cancer cells, genetic alterations can activate proto-oncogenes, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis. However, the protein products of oncogenes are sometimes overexpressed without alteration of the proto-oncogene. Helping to explain this phenomenon, we found that when compared to similarly proliferating nontransformed cell lines, cancer cell lines often expressed substantial amounts of mRNA isoforms with shorter 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). These shorter isoforms usually resulted from alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA). The APA had functional consequences, with the shorter mRNA isoforms exhibiting increased stability and typically producing ten-fold more protein, in part through the loss of microRNA-mediated repression. Moreover, expression of the shorter mRNA isoform of the proto-oncogene IGF2BP1/IMP-1 led to far more oncogenic transformation than did expression of the full-length, annotated mRNA. The high incidence of APA in cancer cells, with consequent loss of 3'UTR repressive elements, suggests a pervasive role for APA in oncogene activation without genetic alteration."

Here, we describe the regulatory mechanism of this transition. We show that miR156 is necessary and sufficient for the expression of the juvenile phase, and regulates the timing of the juvenile-to-adult transition by coordinating the expression of several pathways that control different aspects of this process. miR156 acts by repressing the expression of functionally distinct SPL transcription factors. miR172 acts downstream of miR156 to promote adult epidermal identity. miR156 regulates the expression of miR172 via SPL9 which, redundantly with SPL10, directly promotes the transcription of miR172b. Thus, like the larval-to-adult transition in Caenorhabditis elegans, the juvenile-to-adult transition in Arabidopsis is mediated by sequentially operating miRNAs. miR156 and miR172 are positively regulated by the transcription factors they target, suggesting that negative feedback loops contribute to the stability of the juvenile and adult phases.

Phase change and the regulation of developmental timing in plants.Science. 2003; 301: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) have revealed that these phenomena involve several independently regulated processes that must be temporally coordinated for normal development. An important example of this is the coordination between somatic and reproductive maturation, variation in which is the basis for many examples of morphological evolution (Gould, 1977Gould S.J. Ontogeny and Phylogeny. Belknap Press, Harvard, MA1977Google Scholar). Each of these maturation processes itself consists of a variety of independently-regulated events that must be temporally coordinated. How this coordination is achieved is a major problem in developmental biology. In C. elegans, transitions between stages of larval development are mediated by an increase in the expression of two sequentially expressed miRNAs, lin-4 and let-7 (reviewed in Moss, 2007Moss E.G.

These were the first miRNAs to be discovered, and they have since served as paradigms for the function of this class of regulatory molecules in animals (Lee et al., 1993Lee R.C. Feinbaum R.L.

Remarkably, miRNAs have a similar function in plants. As a plant grows, it undergoes a transition from a juvenile to an adult stage of vegetative development (vegetative phase change) and then enters a reproductive phase (reproductive phase change or floral induction), during which it produces flowers or other types of reproductive structures. In Arabidopsis, vegetative phase change is marked by changes in the production of trichomes on the abaxial (lower) surface of the leaf, an increase in the length/width (L/W) ratio of the leaf blade, an increase in the degree of serration of the leaf margin and a decrease in cell size (Telfer et al., 1997Telfer A.

Recent studies suggest that miR156, and possibly miR172, play pivotal roles in these transitions. In both Arabidopsis and maize, miR156 is highly expressed early in shoot development and decreases with time, while miR172 has the opposite expression pattern (Aukerman and Sakai, 2003Aukerman M.J.

Overexpression of miR156 in both Arabidopsis and maize prolongs the expression of juvenile vegetative traits and delays flowering (Chuck et al., 2007aChuck G. Cigan A.M. Saeteurn K. Hake S.

The GIGANTEA-regulated microRNA172 mediates photoperiodic flowering independent of CONSTANS in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 2736-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that these miRNAs have related, but opposite, functions in shoot maturation. Although the targets of miR156 and miR172 have been identified, the functions of these targets are still poorly characterized. In Arabidopsis, miR156 targets 10 members of the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE (SPL) family of transcription factors (SPL2, SPL3, SPL4, SPL5, SPL6, SPL9, SPL10, SPL11, SPL13, SPL15), while miR172 targets 6 APETALA2-LIKE (AP2-like) transcription factors (AP2, TOE1, TOE2, TOE3, SMZ, SNZ). The gain-of-function or loss-of-function phenotype of single gene mutations reveals a high degree of functional redundancy within these families. Loss-of-function mutations of SPL3 have no obvious phenotype, but constitutive expression of this gene or its closely related paralogs SPL4 and SPL5 produces an early flowering phenotype, accelerates the production of trichomes on the abaxial surface of the leaf (an adult trait) (Gandikota et al., 2007Gandikota M. Birkenbihl R.P. Hohmann S. Cardon G.H. Saedler H. Huijser P.

Poethig R.S. Temporal regulation of shoot development in Arabidopsis thaliana by miR156 and its target SPL3.Development. 2006; 133: 3539-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), and produces changes in cell size and cell number typical of adult leaves (Usami et al., 2009Usami T. Horiguchi G. Yano S. Tsukaya H.

Overexpression of SPL9 reduces the rate of leaf initiation and increases leaf size (Wang et al., 2008Wang J.W. Schwab R. Czech B. Mica E. Weigel D. Dual effects of miR156-targeted SPL genes and CYP78A5/KLUH on plastochron length and organ size in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and a similar phenotype is observed in a gain-of-function mutant of SPL15 (Usami et al., 2009Usami T. Horiguchi G. Yano S. Tsukaya H. The more and smaller cells mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana identify novel roles for SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE genes in the control of heteroblasty.Development. 2009; 136: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations in either SPL9 or SPL15 have minor effects on development. Plants doubly mutant for these related genes have a stronger phenotype than the single mutants, which reveals that they promote both vegetative phase change and flowering (Schwarz et al., 2008Schwarz S. Grande A.V. Bujdoso N. Saedler H. Huijser P. The microRNA regulated SBP-box genes SPL9 and SPL15 control shoot maturation in Arabidopsis.Plant Mol.

The targets of miR172 have an opposite effect on phase change. Plants lacking TOE1 and TOE2 are early flowering, whereas plants overexpressing TOE1, TOE2, SNZ, or SMZ are late flowering (Aukerman and Sakai, 2003Aukerman M.J. Sakai H.

Dissection of floral induction pathways using global expression analysis.Development. 2003; 130: 6001-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Although there is still no evidence that these AP2-like genes contribute to vegetative phase change in Arabidopsis, their maize homolog Glossy15 (Gl15) promotes juvenile epidermal identity (Evans et al., 1994Evans M.M. Passas H.J. Poethig R.S. Heterochronic effects of glossy15 mutations on epidermal cell identity in maize.Development. 1994; 120: 1971-1981PubMed Google Scholar, Moose and Sisco, 1994Moose S.P.

Glossy15, an APETALA2-like gene from maize that regulates leaf epidermal cell identity.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3018-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), suggesting that one or more of the Arabidopsis homologs may do so as well. Whether these SPL and AP2-like genes operate in the same or different pathways is unknown. We undertook a genetic and molecular analysis of miR156, miR172 and their targets to define their roles in vegetative phase change. Our results indicate that miR156 is both necessary and sufficient for the expression of the juvenile phase, and that it functions as a master regulator of this phase. The targets of miR156 act in several pathways that control both flowering time and different aspects of vegetative development. One of these pathways includes miR172b. We show that miR156 regulates the expression of miR172b via SPL9, which acts as a direct transcriptional regulator of miR172b. Our results suggest a model for the temporal coordination of vegetative phase change and floral induction. In Arabidopsis, floral induction affects the development of unexpanded rosette leaves in ways that can make it difficult to observe the juvenile-to-adult transition. This is particularly problematic in genotypes that flower very early in long days, which applies to many of the stocks used in this study. For this reason, all of the experiments reported here were conducted with plants grown in short days to delay flowering. Under short day conditions, plants expressing miR156a under the regulation of the constitutive 35S promoter produced approximately 90 leaves that resembled juvenile leaves in size, shape, and their lack of abaxial trichomes (Figures 1A and 1B). In contrast, all leaves produced by plants in which the activity of miR156 was suppressed by constitutively expressing a transcript with non-cleavable miR156 target site (a target-site mimic, MIM156) (Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007Franco-Zorrilla J.M. Valli A. Todesco M. Mateos I. Puga M.I. Rubio-Somoza I. Leyva A. Weigel D. Garcia J.A. Paz-Ares J. Target mimicry provides a new mechanism for regulation of microRNA activity.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) resembled adult leaves. The effect of 35S::MIM156 on leaf development was particularly striking in the case of the first two rosette leaves. In 35S::MIM156 plants, the first two rosette leaves were unusually large and elongated, and possessed serrated leaf margins and abaxial trichomes–features of adult leaves. Later-formed leaves were larger, but nearly identical in shape to these first two rosette leaves. Thus, miR156 promotes the expression of all juvenile leaf traits, and is both necessary and sufficient for the expression of these traits. The SPL genes targeted by miR156 can be grouped into four major clades: SPL3/SPL4/SPL5, SPL2/SPL10/SPL11, SPL9/SPL15, SPL6/SPL13 (Guo et al., 2008Guo A.Y. Zhu Q.H. Gu X. Ge S. Yang J. Luo J. Genome-wide identification and evolutionary analysis of the plant specific SBP-box transcription factor family.Gene. 2008; 418: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). SPL3, SPL9 and SPL10 are representative members from three of these clades. To investigate the function of SPL3, SPL9 and SPL10, we first examined their spatial expression pattern in vegetative shoot apices by RNA in situ hybridization. SPL3 was present uniformly throughout the shoot apex and in expanding leaf primordia and increased in abundance between 15 and 22 days after planting (Figures 2A–2C). SPL9 was expressed at a much lower level than SPL3, and was barely visible in young leaf primordia in 22-day-old shoots (Figures 2D and 2E). To confirm this expression pattern, we examined plants transformed with pSPL9::rSPL9, a construct that expresses a miR156-resistant SPL9 transcript under the control of its native promoter. Consistent with its wild-type expression pattern, transgenic plants expressed SPL9 in both pre-emergent and expanding leaf primordia (Figure 2F). These results are consistent with previous suggestions (Wang et al., 2008Wang J.W. Schwab R. Czech B. Mica E. Weigel D. Dual effects of miR156-targeted SPL genes and CYP78A5/KLUH on plastochron length and organ size in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) that miR156 regulates the abundance of SPL9 transcripts, but not their spatial expression pattern. SPL10 transcripts were undetectable in wild-type shoot apices. To define the roles of these genes in vegetative phase change, we characterized their loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes. spl9-4 delayed abaxial trichome production by 2.8 plastochrons and caused the leaf blade to become rounder (Figures 2G and 2H). SPL15 is the closest paralog of SPL9. spl15-1 mutants had no obvious effect on abaxial trichome production or leaf shape. Plants doubly mutant for spl9-4 and spl15-1 produced abaxial trichomes 1.6 plastochrons later than spl9-4 but had same leaf shape as spl9-4 (L/W = 1.48 ± 0.08 for spl9 spl15 versus 1.50 ± 0.11 for spl9). These results imply that SPL15 has overlapping functions with SPL9, but has a less important role in leaf morphogenesis than SPL9. Loss-of-function mutations in SPL3 and SPL10 had no obvious vegetative phenotype, presumably because their function overlaps with other SPL genes. Transgenes expressing miR156-resistant versions of SPL3, SPL9 and SPL10 affected leaf development in different ways. 35S::rSPL3 accelerated abaxial tricome production by 1.5 plastochrons, but had no significant effect on leaf shape (Figures 2G and 2H). pSPL9::rSPL9 and pSPL10::rSPL10 accelerated the expression of all adult-specific leaf traits, producing leaves with an elongated leaf blade, serrated leaf margin, and abaxial trichomes (Figures 2G and 2H). However, the leaves of rSPL10 plants were flatter, rounder and more serrated than those of rSPL9, and also had a more distinct petiole (Figures 2G and 2H). As expected from their high degree of sequence similarity, the phenotype of pSPL11::rSPL11 was similar to that of pSPL10::rSPL10 (data not shown). Thus, SPL3, SPL9 and SPL10/SPL11 have overlapping, but distinct functions in vegetative development. miR172 promotes flowering when overexpressed (Aukerman and Sakai, 2003Aukerman M.J. Sakai H.

To address this question we examined the vegetative phenotype of plants transformed with a genomic fragment containing the miR172b precursor under the control of the 35S promoter (35S::miR172b). The leaves of plants expressing 35S::miR172b produced abaxial trichomes two plastochrons earlier than normal, but these leaves were otherwise morphologically normal (Table 1). 35S::miR172a had essentially the same phenotype as 35S::miR172b; furthermore, a T-DNA insertion in miR172a (SALK_045787) delayed abaxial trichome production by about three plastochrons while having no obvious effect on leaf morphology (Table 1). Thus, miR172 promotes adult epidermal identity, but has little, if any, role in the regulation of leaf shape.Table 1The Effect of miR172, TOE1, and TOE2 on Abaxial Trichome Production and Leaf ShapeGenotype1st Leaf with Abaxial TrichomesLeaf Length/Width (Leaf 7)Wild-type7.0 ± 0.51.64 ± 0.0935S::miR172b5.0 ± 0.9aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01, n = 24, ± SD).1.63 ± 0.09miR172a-1 (SALK_045787)9.6 ± 1.0aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01, n = 24, ± SD).1.61 ± 0.10Wild-type6.6 ± 0.51.64 ± 0.09toe1-25.6 ± 0.6aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01, n = 24, ± SD).1.65 ± 0.11toe2-15.5 ± 0.6aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01, n = 24, ± SD).1.66 ± 0.14toe1-2, toe2-13.2 ± 0.4aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01, n = 24, ± SD).1.68 ± 0.1335S::TOE110.4 ± 0.9aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01, n = 24, ± SD).1.51 ± 0.07cSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01, n = 10, ± SD).Wild-type7.2 ± 1.0toe2-15.5 ± 0.535S::miR156a90.0 ± 1.6toe2-1, 35S::miR156a9.5 ± 1.4bSignificantly different from all other genotypes (p < 0.01, n = 24, ± SD).Wild-type7.2 ± 0.7spl9-49.8 ± 1.3toe1-2, toe2-13.0 ± 0.2spl9-4, toe1-2, toe2-13.7 ± 0.7bSignificantly different from all other genotypes (p < 0.01, n = 24, ± SD).a Significantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01, n = 24, ± SD).b Significantly different from all other genotypes (p < 0.01, n = 24, ± SD).c Significantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01, n = 10, ± SD).

Gain- and loss-of-function mutations in TOE1 and TOE2 have been shown to affect flowering time (Aukerman and Sakai, 2003Aukerman M.J. Sakai H.

Abaxial trichome production was accelerated by one plastochron in plants homozygous for toe1-2 or toe2-1 (hereafter referred to as toe1 and toe2), and by three plastochrons in toe1 toe2 double mutants. Neither the single mutants or the double mutant had an effect on leaf shape (Table 1). In contrast, constitutive expression of TOE1 (35S::TOE1) delayed abaxial trichome production by 4 plastochrons and caused the leaf blade to become slightly rounder than normal (Table 1). We conclude that TOE1 and TOE2 act primarily to promote juvenile epidermal identity, and probably mediate the effect of mR172 on vegetative development. Previous studies have shown that miR156 decreases during shoot development in Arabidopsis (Wu and Poethig, 2006Wu G. Poethig R.S.

The GIGANTEA-regulated microRNA172 mediates photoperiodic flowering independent of CONSTANS in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 2736-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar); however, the expression of these miRNAs has not been directly compared in the same material. For this purpose, RNA blots of shoot apices harvested 12, 19 and 26 days after planting were hybridized sequentially with probes to these miRNAs. miR156 and miR172 were expressed in inverse patterns: miR156 declined between 12 and 19 days after planting, whereas miR172 increased during this same period (Figure 3A). To determine if these changes are causally related, we examined the level of miR156 and miR172 in plants overexpressing these miRNAs. Plants transformed with 35S::miR156a had half the normal amount of miR172, whereas plants transformed with 35S::MIM156 had over twice the normal amount of miR172 (Figure 3B). By contrast, 35S::miR172b had little or no effect on miR156. Thus, miR156 regulates the expression of miR172, but not the reverse. To determine if this effect is functionally significant, we examined the phenotype of plants homozygous for both 35S::miR156a and 35S::miR172b. These double transgenic plants had leaves that were the size and shape of 35S::miR156a leaves, but initiated abaxial trichome production earlier than 35S::miR156a plants (Figure 3C). Indeed, their pattern of abaxial trichome production was much closer to that of 35S::miR172b than to 35S::miR156a. This result supports the conclusion that miR172 acts downstream of miR156, and provides additional evidence that miR172 primarily regulates epidermal differentiation. If miR172 mediates the effect of miR156 on epidermal identity by repressing the expression of TOE1 and TOE2, then the early abaxial trichome phenotype of toe1 and/or toe2 should be epistatic to the late abaxial trichome phenotype of 35S::miR156. Consistent with this prediction, toe2 nearly completely rescued the abaxial trichome phenotype of 35S::miR156a in double mutants (Table 1). We were unable to examine the genetic interaction between toe1 and 35S::miR156a because the miR156a transgene was silenced in toe1-2 35S::miR156a plants, probably because toe1-2 is a T-DNA induced mutation and shares sequences with the 35S::miR56a construct (Daxinger et al., 2008Daxinger L.

Although toe2-1 is also a T-DNA induced mutation, it does not silence 35S::miR56a. miR156 represses 10 members of the SPL gene family (Rhoades et al., 2002Rhoades M.W. Reinhart B.J. Lim L.P.

To identify the SPL genes that mediate the effect of miR156 on miR172, we analyzed the expression of miR172 in plants expressing miR156-resistant versions of SPL3, SPL4, SPL5, SPL9 and SPL10. Although the phenotypes of 35S::rSPL3, 35S::rSPL4 and 35S::rSPL5 are similar to that of 35S::miR172b and toe1 toe2 (Table 1), these transgenes had no effect on the abundance of miR172 (Figure 4A) or the abundance of the TOE1 and TOE2 transcripts (Figure 4B). To determine if SPL3, SPL4 and SPL5 act downstream of TOE1 and TOE2 we examined the their expression in toe1 toe2 mutants and 35S::TOE1 plants. SPL3 was slightly (1.5 to 2-fold) but consistently overexpressed in toe1 toe2, but was either slightly downregulated or unaffected by 35S::TOE1 (Figure 4C). SPL4 and SPL5 were expressed much more variably than SPL3 in toe1 toe2.

The onset of flowering is a major developmental transition that is critical to the reproductive success of plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the MADS domain protein APETALA1 (AP1) and the plant-specific transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) are master regulators that control the fate of flowers produced at the shoot apex. In the absence of AP1 and LFY, flowers are replaced by shoots or by flowers that have shoot-like characteristics (reviewed in Lohmann and Weigel, 2002Lohmann J.U. Weigel D. Building beauty: the genetic control of floral patterning.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 135-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The activation of LFY and AP1 in response to floral inductive signals involves several MADS domain proteins, including SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), FRUITFULL (FUL), and AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24) (Lee et al., 2008Lee J.

CO is connected to the MADS box genes through activation of FT, which integrates information from several positively and negatively acting signaling pathways. An overwhelming amount of circumstantial evidence indicates that the small FT protein is a long-distance signal that moves directly from leaves to the shoot apex (reviewed in Bäurle and Dean, 2006Bäurle I.

FT executes its role through interaction with the bZIP transcription factor FD, which is expressed specifically at the shoot apex, where the FT/FD complex activates several MADS box genes (Abe et al., 2005Abe M.

Integration of spatial and temporal information during floral induction in Arabidopsis.Science. 2005; 309: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Like FT in leaves, FD at the shoot apex is a direct target of the potent repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), which mediates the effects of winter-like exposure to cold temperature, vernalization (Searle et al., 2006Searle I. He Y. Turck F. Vincent C. Fornara F. Kröber S. Amasino R.A. Coupland G. The transcription factor FLC confers a flowering response to vernalization by repressing meristem competence and systemic signaling in Arabidopsis.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 898-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). FLC forms a complex with another MADS domain protein, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), and together they repress not only FT but also the FT target SOC1 (Lee et al., 2007Lee J.H. Yoo S.J. Park S.H.

Cell. 2008; 15: 110-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Another set of transcriptional regulators that is expressed before LFY and AP1 are activated at the shoot apex comprises several miRNA156-regulated SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) factors (Cardon et al., 1997Cardon G.H. Hohmann S. Nettesheim K. Saedler H. Huijser P. Functional analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana SBP-box gene SPL3: a novel gene involved in the floral transition.Plant J. 1997; 12: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, Schmid et al., 2003Schmid M.

Dissection of floral induction pathways using global expression analysis.Development. 2003; 130: 6001-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). This class of proteins was discovered in snapdragon, from which the founding member was isolated based on its ability to bind a conserved motif in the promoter of the AP1 ortholog SQUAMOSA (Klein et al., 1996Klein J. Saedler H. Huijser P. A new family of DNA binding proteins includes putative transcriptional regulators of the Antirrhinum majus floral meristem identity gene SQUAMOSA.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 7-16PubMed Google Scholar). In A. thaliana, there are two broad classes of miR156 targets: SPL3, SPL4, and SPL5 encode small proteins that consist mostly of the SBP DNA binding domain, whereas the other eight miR156 targets in A. thaliana encode much larger proteins (Cardon et al., 1999Cardon G.

Comparative study of SBP-box gene family in Arabidopsis and rice.Gene. 2008; 407: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). SPL3, SPL4, and SPL5 appear to function mostly in the control of flowering time and phase change, whereas SPL9 and its paralog SPL15, which are members of the second group, also have strong effects on leaf initiation rate. Consistent with both groups of SPL factors being important for flowering, overexpression of SPL3 and SPL9 accelerates flowering, whereas reduction in SPL activity through miR156 overexpression delays the onset of flowering (Cardon et al., 1997Cardon G.H. Hohmann S. Nettesheim K. Saedler H. Huijser P.

Poethig R.S. Temporal regulation of shoot development in Arabidopsis thaliana by miR156 and its target SPL3.Development. 2006; 133: 3539-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Previous expression studies have suggested that the SPL genes affect flowering as downstream targets of CO and FT at the shoot apex (Schmid et al., 2003Schmid M. Uhlenhaut N.H. Godard F. Demar M. Bressan R. Weigel D. Lohmann J.U. Dissection of floral induction pathways using global expression analysis.Development. 2003; 130: 6001-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Here, we show that SPL genes have an important FT-independent role in regulating flowering. SPLs and the FT/FD complex share several direct targets, including AP1, that act in multiple feed-forward loops. We conclude that the miR156/SPL module represents a major regulatory axis for the promotion of flowering in the absence of photoperiodic cues. We used small RNA blots to complement previous studies on the expression pattern of miR156 during the A. thaliana life cycle (Gandikota et al., 2007Gandikota M. Birkenbihl R.P. Hohmann S. Cardon G.H. Saedler H. Huijser P.

Poethig R.S. Temporal regulation of shoot development in Arabidopsis thaliana by miR156 and its target SPL3.Development. 2006; 133: 3539-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). In short days, miR156 levels were highest in young seedlings and subsequently declined over several weeks (Figure 1A; Wu and Poethig, 2006Wu G. Poethig R.S. Temporal regulation of shoot development in Arabidopsis thaliana by miR156 and its target SPL3.Development. 2006; 133: 3539-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). We observed a similar pattern for pri-MIR156a by using reverse transcription followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 1B), suggesting that the primary regulation of miR156 is at the transcriptional level. The temporal expression pattern of SPL3 is the inverse of miR156, with low levels in short-day grown seedlings and a gradual increase during vegetative development (Wu and Poethig, 2006Wu G. Poethig R.S. Temporal regulation of shoot development in Arabidopsis thaliana by miR156 and its target SPL3.Development. 2006; 133: 3539-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). We observed a similar profile for SPL9 (Figure 1C). The AtGenExpress expression atlas (Schmid et al., 2005Schmid M. Davison T.S. Henz S.R. Pape U.J. Demar M. Vingron M. Schölkopf B. Weigel D. Lohmann J.U. A gene expression map of Arabidopsis thaliana development.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar) indicated similar trends for several additional miR156 targets (Figure S1 available online). Inactivation or overexpression of the flowering regulators FLC, CO, FT, or SOC1 had no obvious effects on miR156 levels in whole seedlings. This was also true for plants treated with plant hormones, including the gibberellin GA3, which accelerates flowering (Langridge, 1957Langridge J.

Gibberellin is required for flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana under short days.Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), auxin (IAA), or cytokinin (Figure 1D). Similarly, SPL9 transcript levels in seedlings were not affected by increased expression of the floral repressor FLC in plants that have a functional copy of the FLC activator FRIGIDA (FRI) (Michaels and Amasino, 1999Michaels S.D. Amasino R.M. FLOWERING LOCUS C encodes a novel MADS domain protein that acts as a repressor of flowering.Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar), nor did they respond to vernalization, to GA3 treatment, or to elimination of endogenous gibberellins in the ga1-3 mutant (Figure 1E). Vernalization or GA treatment accelerated the flowering of p35S:MIR156 plants, but less than that of wild-type (Table S1). The flowering responses together with the absence of major effects of vernalization and GA treatment on miR156 and SPL levels suggest that the miR156/SPL module promotes flowering in parallel with, or upstream of, these two pathways, which was further supported by the finding that SPL3 overexpression from a p35S:rSPL3 construct (see below) could accelerate the flowering of FRI FLC or ga1-3 plants (Table S1). At the shoot apex, upregulation of SPL3 and SPL9 is readily detectable by microarrays within 3 days after transfer of vegetative plants from short days to inductive long days, and this induction is much reduced in co and ft mutants (Schmid et al., 2003Schmid M. Uhlenhaut N.H. Godard F. Demar M. Bressan R. Weigel D. Lohmann J.U. Dissection of floral induction pathways using global expression analysis.Development. 2003; 130: 6001-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Much higher levels of expression in florally induced apices compared to vegetative apices were observed for most miR156 targets (Figure S1). Transfer to long days did not cause an obvious change in miR156 levels at the shoot apex (Figure S2), suggesting that photoperiod-dependent upregulation of SPLs is not due to a release of miR156 inhibition. In situ hybridization did not reveal a distinct pattern of SPL3 expression in vegetative apices, whereas SPL9 transcripts were strongest in leaf primordia and the provascular strands of young leaves (Figures 1F and 1G; Wang et al., 2008Wang J.W. Schwab R. Czech B. Mica E. Weigel D. Dual effects of miR156-targeted SPL genes and CYP78A5/KLUH on plastochron length and organ size in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). After transfer to long days, SPL3 and SPL9 levels increased in both existing leaves and newly formed primordia, with SPL9 being also expressed in provascular strands below the shoot apical meristem. SPL9 was transiently upregulated in floral anlagen and very early floral primordia, but declined again by stage 2 of flower development. Expression of SPL3 in newly formed primordia was strongest in cryptic bracts subtending flowers (Long and Barton, 2000Long J. Barton M.K. Initiation of axillary and floral meristems in Arabidopsis.Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). miR156 overexpression reduced SPL3 and SPL9 transcripts to background levels (Figures 1F and 1G). p35S:MIR156 plants had a reduced response to transient exposure to long days, with 5 instead of 2 days required for quantitative induction of flowering (Schwarz et al., 2008Schwarz S. Grande A.V. Bujdoso N. Saedler H. Huijser P. The microRNA regulated SBP-box genes SPL9 and SPL15 control shoot maturation in Arabidopsis.Plant Mol. Biol. 2008; 67: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar; data not shown). This was not caused by attenuated FT induction, as determined by transiently exposing short-day-grown p35S:MIR156 plants to 2 long days (Figure S3A), nor was it due to reduced expression of the FT partner FD before photoperiodic induction (Figure S3B). Finally, in ft-10 tsf-1 plants, which lack activity of both FT and its paralog TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) (Michaels et al., 2005Michaels S.D. Himelblau E. Kim S.Y. Schomburg F.M. Amasino R.M.

TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) acts as a floral pathway integrator redundantly with FT.Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 1175-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), SPL9 expression in shoot apices increased from the vegetative phase until and through the transition of flowering (Figure 1H), confirming a photoperiod-independent but age-dependent rise in SPL9 expression. Taken together, these data indicate that SPL levels increase throughout the plant with increasing age, but that in addition, acute induction of flowering through the photoperiod pathway can cause an immediate and strong upregulation of SPL genes at the shoot apex. The effects of miR156 and its SPL targets on leaf initiation rate, which is accelerated in plants with attenuated SPL activity but reduced in plants with increased SPL activity (Schwarz et al., 2008Schwarz S.

Nevertheless, when taking both leaf number and chronological time into account, it is clear that overexpression of miR156, which reduces SPL expression, moderately delays flowering, whereas inhibition of miR156 activity, either by mutating its target site in SPL3 (p35S:rSPL3) or through a miR156 target mimic (p35S:MIM156), accelerates flowering (Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007Franco-Zorrilla J.M.

Open table in a new tab Standard deviation is given. n = 14 for all genotypes. To explore the tissue requirement of SPLs, we made use of plants that misexpress miR156 from the SUC2 promoter in phloem companion cells, the site of FT action (An et al., 2004An H. Roussot C. Suárez-López P. Corbesier L. Vincent C. Piñeiro M. Hepworth S. Mouradov A. Justin S. Turnbull C. et al.CONSTANS acts in the phloem to regulate a systemic signal that induces photoperiodic flowering of Arabidopsis.Development. 2004; 131: 3615-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, Takada and Goto, 2003Takada S. Goto K. TERMINAL FLOWER2, an Arabidopsis homolog of HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1, counteracts the activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T by CONSTANS in the vascular tissues of leaves to regulate flowering time.Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2856-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), or in FD-expressing cells at the shoot apex. pFD:MIR156 plants (in which plastochron length is unaffected; Wang et al., 2008Wang J.W. Schwab R. Czech B. Mica E. Weigel D. Dual effects of miR156-targeted SPL genes and CYP78A5/KLUH on plastochron length and organ size in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) flowered even later than p35S:MIR156 plants. This was slightly enhanced when we introduced in addition a pSUC2:MIR156 transgene, which on its own had a lesser effect on flowering (Table 1). Consistent with SPLs being able to act both in the phloem and at the shoot apex, expression of the nontargeted version of SPL3, rSPL3, from either the SUC2 and FD promoter led to early flowering (Table 1; Wang et al., 2008Wang J.W. Schwab R. Czech B. Mica E. Weigel D. Dual effects of miR156-targeted SPL genes and CYP78A5/KLUH on plastochron length and organ size in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Thus, although the shoot apex has a higher requirement for SPL activity than does the phloem, SPL genes act at both sites, similar to SOC1 and FLC (Searle et al., 2006Searle I. He Y. Turck F. Vincent C. Fornara F. Kröber S. Amasino R.A. Coupland G. The transcription factor FLC confers a flowering response to vernalization by repressing meristem competence and systemic signaling in Arabidopsis.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 898-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). pFD:rSPL3 ft-10 plants were intermediate between the parents, but the ft-10 mutation suppressed the effects of rSPL3 expression in the phloem (Table 1). Similar results were obtained with misexpression of rSPL9 (Wang et al., 2008Wang J.W. Schwab R. Czech B. Mica E. Weigel D. Dual effects of miR156-targeted SPL genes and CYP78A5/KLUH on plastochron length and organ size in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Thus, SPLs may act through FT in the phloem. To identify SPL targets, we analyzed the transcriptome of argonaute1 (ago1-27) and serrate (se-1) plants, which both overexpress SPL genes resulting from reduced miR156 accumulation (Ronemus et al., 2006Ronemus M. Vaughn M.W. Martienssen R.A.

We compared these two genotypes to p35S:MIR156 se-1, in which SPL transcripts are reduced, and to wild-type.

Pluripotency can be recreated by somatic cell reprogramming. Here we present evidence that the homeodomain protein Nanog mediates acquisition of both embryonic and induced pluripotency. Production of pluripotent hybrids by cell fusion is promoted by and dependent on Nanog. In transcription factor-induced molecular reprogramming, Nanog is initially dispensable but becomes essential for dedifferentiated intermediates to transit to ground state pluripotency. In the embryo, Nanog specifically demarcates the nascent epiblast, coincident with the domain of X chromosome reprogramming. Without Nanog, pluripotency does not develop, and the inner cell mass is trapped in a pre-pluripotent, indeterminate state that is ultimately nonviable. These findings suggest that Nanog choreographs synthesis of the naive epiblast ground state in the embryo and that this function is recapitulated in the culmination of somatic cell reprogramming.

Pluripotency is the capacity of a single cell to generate in a flexible manner all cell lineages of the developing and adult organism. This is an essential, albeit transient, attribute of cells in embryos that undergo regulative development. After fertilization, mammalian zygotes follow a program of cleavage divisions and elaborate two extraembryonic lineages, trophoblast and hypoblast (Selwood and Johnson, 2006Selwood L. Johnson M.H. Trophoblast and hypoblast in the monotreme, marsupial and eutherian mammal: evolution and origins.Bioessays. 2006; 28: 128-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This preparatory phase of development culminates in creation of the embryo founder tissue, a population of unrestricted pluripotent cells known as the epiblast (Gardner and Beddington, 1988Gardner R.L.

Naive and Primed Pluripotent States.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 487-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). The epiblast proliferates to provide the substrate for axis formation, germlayer specification, and gastrulation. Naive early epiblast cells can be immortalized in culture in the form of embryonic stem (ES) cells (Brook and Gardner, 1997Brook F.A. Gardner R.L.

Pluripotent cells can also be created outside the embryo by reprogramming somatic cells, either by fusion with pre-existing pluripotent cells (Miller and Ruddle, 1976Miller R.A. Ruddle F.H.

Understanding of how pluripotent cells are generated remains rudimentary, however. Nanog is a highly divergent homeodomain-containing protein commonly accorded a central position in the transcriptional network of pluripotency (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F.

Forced expression of Nanog is sufficient to drive cytokine-independent self-renewal of undifferentiated ES cells (Chambers et al., 2003Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S.

Surprisingly, however, Nanog is not one of the canonical quartet of transcription factors employed to reprogram mouse fibroblasts (Maherali et al., 2007Maherali N. Sridharan R. Xie W. Utikal J.

Moreover, addition of Nanog to this quartet has not been reported to increase efficiencies. However, Nanog is expressed weakly or not at all in incompletely reprogrammed cells that fail to activate properly the endogenous pluripotent transcriptional circuitry (Silva et al., 2008Silva J. Barrandon O. Nichols J. Kawaguchi J. Theunissen T.W. Smith A.

Yamanaka S.

Selection or screening for activation of endogenous Nanog expression facilitates isolation of fully reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that can contribute to adult chimeras and give germline transmission (Okita et al., 2007Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Generation of germline-competent induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3582) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in human cells Nanog does facilitate molecular reprogramming (Yu et al., 2007Yu J. Vodyanik M.A. Smuga-Otto K. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Frane J.L. Tian S. Nie J. Jonsdottir G.A. Ruotti V. Stewart R. et al.Induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human somatic cells.Science. 2007; 318: 1917-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (8273) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Nanog promotes the transfer of pluripotency after ES cell fusion (Silva et al., 2006Silva J. Chambers I. Pollard S. Smith A. Nanog promotes transfer of pluripotency after cell fusion.Nature. 2006; 441: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Nanog null embryos do not develop beyond implantation (Mitsui et al., 2003Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Marauyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. The homeoprotein Nanog is required for maintenance of pluripotency in mouse epiblast and ES cells.Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). An inner cell mass (ICM) is evident in mutant blastocysts and the collapse of post-implantation development has been assumed to reflect a requirement for Nanog to maintain and expand the pluripotent epiblast (Mitsui et al., 2003Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Marauyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. The homeoprotein Nanog is required for maintenance of pluripotency in mouse epiblast and ES cells.Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). However, conditional gene deletion in ES cells revealed that Nanog is not essential for propagation of pluripotency ex vivo (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Nanog null ES cells are more prone to differentiate but can be maintained indefinitely. Moreover, they contribute extensively to somatic chimeras, presenting a major discrepancy with the embryo deletion analysis. In this study, by clarifying the role of Nanog in generation versus maintenance of pluripotency, we seek to resolve paradoxes arising from previous findings. We compare experimental induction of pluripotency from somatic cells with natural development of pluripotency in the blastocyst. Transgenic expression of Nanog promotes formation of pluripotent hybrids after fusion of ES cells with somatic cells (Silva et al., 2006Silva J. Chambers I. Pollard S. Smith A. Nanog promotes transfer of pluripotency after cell fusion.Nature. 2006; 441: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We investigated whether upregulation of endogenous Nanog may have a similar effect. Exposure of ES cells to 3 μM MEK inhibitor (PD184352 or PD0325901) (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar) in the presence of serum and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) results in increased expression of Nanog without altering levels of Oct4 (Figures 1A and 1B). Rex1, a sensitive indicator of undifferentiated ES cell status (Toyooka et al., 2008Toyooka Y. Shimosato D. Murakami K. Takahashi K. Niwa H. Identification and characterization of subpopulations in undifferentiated ES cell culture.Development. 2008; 135: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), is also unchanged suggesting that the increase in Nanog is not secondary to reduced differentiation. Nanog has been shown to fluctuate in ES cells cultured in serum and LIF (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). MEK inhibition increases the fraction of Nanog-positive cells to over 90% and also increases the mean and maximum levels of expression (Figure 1C and Figure S1 available online). We treated ES cells with 3 μM MEK inhibitor for 3 days prior to polyethylene glycol (PEG) mediated fusion with brain-derived neural stem (NS) cells. The NS cells constitutively express tauGFP and puromycin resistance whereas the ES cells express the dsRed2 and hygromycin resistance, enabling detection and selection of hybrids (Silva et al., 2006Silva J. Chambers I. Pollard S. Smith A. Nanog promotes transfer of pluripotency after cell fusion.Nature. 2006; 441: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Fused cells were purified by flow cytometry 24 hr after PEG treatment, quantitated (Figure 1D), and plated in complete ES cell medium. MEK inhibitor was maintained for 72 hr after sorting, then withdrawn. Puromycin plus hygromycin selection was then applied. Macroscopic colonies of typical ES cell morphology emerged after 5–6 days under selection. All of these expressed GFP and dsRed2 (Figure 1E). Plates were fixed on day 12 and stained for alkaline phosphatase, a marker of ES cells (Figure 1D). MEK inhibitor-treated cultures yielded a greater than 40-fold increase in undifferentiated hybrid colonies, normalized to the number of fused cells plated to eliminate variation due to differences in fusion efficiency (Figure 1F). This dramatic effect of MEK inhibition is likely to be mediated at least in part via upregulation of Nanog since endogenous Nanog is normally limiting for transfer of the pluripotent state (Silva et al., 2006Silva J. Chambers I. Pollard S. Smith A. Nanog promotes transfer of pluripotency after cell fusion.Nature. 2006; 441: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We then exploited the availability of Nanog null (Δ) ES cells (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) to evaluate whether Nanog may be necessary to produce pluripotent hybrids. As controls we employed both parental ES cells and NanogΔ cells with restored Nanog expression from a constitutive transgene (Δ+Ng) (Figure 1G). Fusion of parental ES cells with Oct4-GiP NS cells generated around 70 colonies per plate (Figures 1H and 1I). Δ+Ng ES cells yielded increased numbers of hybrid colonies, >400 per plate, consistent with the enhancing effect of overexpression of Nanog (Silva et al., 2006Silva J. Chambers I. Pollard S. Smith A. Nanog promotes transfer of pluripotency after cell fusion.Nature. 2006; 441: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In contrast, fusions using NanogΔ ES cells yielded only 2–3 hybrid colonies in identical conditions (Figures 1H and 1I). This 25-fold reduction in hybrid yield indicates that Nanog expression is a critical determinant for the efficiency of reprogramming. Furthermore the occasional hybrid colonies recovered from NanogΔES×NS cell fusions expressed Nanog from the NS cell genome (Figure S2). Activation of Nanog after fusion could compensate for absence from the ES cell partner. We therefore fused NanogΔ ES cells with NanogΔ NS cells (Figure S3). We introduced into the NanogΔ NS cells a dual puromycin resistance and dsRed expression construct. After fusion, 4 × 106 cells were plated per 10 cm dish and placed under selection the following day. A few hybrid colonies, approximately 10 per plate, were evident after 2 weeks, identified by combined red and green fluorescence. These cells did not have typical compact ES cell colony morphology, however (Figure 1J). To clarify their status we transferred them to the selective ground state culture combination of MEK inhibitor and GSK3 inhibitor (2i) plus LIF (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). NS cells cannot survive in 2i and puromycin was maintained to eliminate any persisting unfused ES cells. All cells died or differentiated within days. In contrast hybrids generated between null ES cells and null NS cells expressing a Nanog transgene expanded readily without differentiation. Nanog is not required by established pluripotent cells in 2i/LIF because Nanog null ES cell lines can readily be propagated (Figure S4). We conclude that if Nanog is absent from both fusion partners, hybrid cells do not attain pluripotency. The hybrid results led us to hypothesize that Nanog may be dispensable in the initial stages of reprogramming the somatic cell genome but essential for instating pluripotency. We therefore examined requirements for Nanog during molecular reprogramming (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19304) Google Scholar). NS cells undergo rapid reprogramming after transfection with Oct4, Klf4, and c-Myc, without requirement for exogenous Sox2 (Kim et al., 2008bKim J.B. Zaehres H. Wu G. Gentile L. Ko K. Sebastiano V. Arauzo-Bravo M.J. Ruau D. Han D.W. Zenke M. et al.Pluripotent stem cells induced from adult neural stem cells by reprogramming with two factors.Nature. 2008; 454: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, Silva et al., 2008Silva J. Barrandon O. Nichols J. Kawaguchi J. Theunissen T.W. Smith A.

As a control population we introduced a constitutive Nanog transgene (Ng) into NanogΔ NS cells (Figure 2A). Oct4, Klf4, and c-myc were transduced into NanogΔ and Δ+Ng NS cells. After 3 days, cells were transferred into medium containing serum and LIF. Two days later the plates were near-confluent with compact proliferating cells that had lost the bipolar morphology of NS cells and morphologically resembled undifferentiated ES cells (Figure 2B) (Silva et al., 2008Silva J. Barrandon O. Nichols J. Kawaguchi J. Theunissen T.W. Smith A. Promotion of reprogramming to ground state pluripotency by signal inhibition.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e253https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060253Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). These cells downregulated the NS cell marker Olig2 and acquired the intercellular adhesion molecule Ecadherin (Figure S5B). They expressed ES cell markers SSEA-1 and alkaline phosphatase (Figures S5A and S5C). However, endogenous core pluripotency factors were not robustly expressed (Figure 2F). There were no discernible differences between transduced NanogΔ and Δ+Ng cells. These observations suggest that Nanog is not required to produce a dedifferentiated partially reprogrammed state. Incompletely reprogrammed cells may be promoted to pluripotency by exposure to 2i/LIF (Silva et al., 2008Silva J. Barrandon O. Nichols J. Kawaguchi J. Theunissen T.W. Smith A. Promotion of reprogramming to ground state pluripotency by signal inhibition.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e253https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060253Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). This allowed us to test whether partially reprogrammed NanogΔ cells could transit to pluripotency. NanogΔ cells transduced with the three factors were passaged once on feeders in the presence of serum and LIF, then switched to 2i/LIF. All cells died within 7 days (Figure 2C). No colonies formed from multiple wells plated (Figures 2C and 2D). In marked contrast Δ+Ng cells treated in the same way generated around 100 colonies per plate of 6 × 104 cells, corresponding to a conversion frequency of 0.16% ± 0.02% (Figures 2C and 2D). These colonies were expanded in 2i/LIF and stable lines generated (Figure 2E). Resistance to G418 and hygromycin indicated activation of the endogenous targeted Nanog alleles. They expressed Fgf4 and Rex1 unlike the partially reprogrammed cells (Figure 2F). We deleted the floxed Nanog transgene after conversion in 2i/LIF (Figure S6A) by Cre recombination (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). The deletion is conveniently monitored by gain of dsRed expression. DsRed-positive iPS cells continued to proliferate with undifferentiated morphology and retention of mRNA markers of pluripotency (Figure S6B). To confirm ground state identity and developmental potential, we examined ability to colonize the mouse embryo after morula aggregation. Chimeric fetuses analyzed at mid-gestation exhibited widespread contribution of GFP-positive cells (Figure S6D). Therefore, in line with results in ES cells (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar), Nanog is no longer necessary in iPS cells once pluripotency has been attained by reprogramming. We conclude that Nanog is specifically required for partially reprogrammed pre-iPS cells to reach ground state pluripotency. We then investigated whether partially reprogrammed NanogΔ cells that appear incapable of progression to the ground state are indeed pre-iPS cells. To do this we restored Nanog expression using PiggyBac transposition (Wang et al., 2008Wang W. Lin C. Lu D. Ning Z. Cox T. Melvin D. Wang X. Bradley A. Liu P. Chromosomal transposition of PiggyBac in mouse embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9290-9295Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) to introduce a floxed Nanog transgene into the partially reprogrammed cells. Stable transfectants were obtained after hygromycin selection. Cells were then transferred into 2i/LIF as above. In contrast to nontransfected and empty vector transfected cells that died, PB-Nanog transfectants produced over 1400 colonies per well (Figure 2G). This corresponds to a conversion efficiency of more than 0.4%. These cells are G418 resistant, indicating activation of the endogenous targeted Nanog locus. qRT-PCR analysis revealed silencing of retroviral expression and upregulation of ground state pluripotency markers Rex1 and Klf2 to levels comparable to those found in ES cells (Figure 2H). After tamoxifen-induced Cre excision of the Nanog transgene these cells gave liveborn coat color chimeras (Figure 2I). We then investigated the timing of gene activation in pre-iPS cells after the switch to 2i/LIF. We exploited a clonal line of pre-iPS cells derived from mouse embryo fibroblasts. These cells do not express Nanog or Rex1 (Figure S7), and when maintained in the presence of serum they do not spontaneously acquire pluripotency even under selection for Oct4 promoter activation. However, they convert to germline-competent pluripotency at high efficiency after transfer to 2i/LIF. Conversion takes place over a period of 10 days (Silva et al., 2008Silva J. Barrandon O. Nichols J. Kawaguchi J. Theunissen T.W. Smith A. Promotion of reprogramming to ground state pluripotency by signal inhibition.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e253https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060253Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we found that Nanog mRNA is only significantly upregulated from day 7. This timing is coincident with the upregulation of endogenous pluripotency markers and of an Oct4-GFP transgene reporter (Figures 2J and S7). These data indicate that Nanog is not the immediate target of 2i in pre-iPS cells. Consistent with this interpretation, transgenic expression of Nanog in pre-iPS cells is not sufficient to enable efficient escape from the pre-iPS cell state without exposure to 2i/LIF. Together, these data indicate that Nanog acts at the final stage of the molecular reprogramming process to instate pluripotency. EpiSCs are a cell type in which many components of pluripotent circuitry are naturally present. They are derived from the epithelialized epiblast of post-implantation embryos (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K.

https://openalex.org/W2123973944,"Many signaling systems show adaptation-the ability to reset themselves after responding to a stimulus. We computationally searched all possible three-node enzyme network topologies to identify those that could perform adaptation. Only two major core topologies emerge as robust solutions: a negative feedback loop with a buffering node and an incoherent feedforward loop with a proportioner node. Minimal circuits containing these topologies are, within proper regions of parameter space, sufficient to achieve adaptation. More complex circuits that robustly perform adaptation all contain at least one of these topologies at their core. This analysis yields a design table highlighting a finite set of adaptive circuits. Despite the diversity of possible biochemical networks, it may be common to find that only a finite set of core topologies can execute a particular function. These design rules provide a framework for functionally classifying complex natural networks and a manual for engineering networks.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs of ∼22 nt that regulate target mRNAs through complementary base-pairing (Kim et al., 2009Kim V.N. Han J. Siomi M.C. Biogenesis of small RNAs in animals.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). MiRNAs are generated via two-step processing. In the nucleus, the primary transcript of miRNA gene (pri-miRNA) is cropped into the hairpin-structured precursor (pre-miRNA) by nuclear RNase III Drosha (Lee et al., 2003Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H.

Furthermore, we observed that Lin28 mediates the terminal uridylation of pre-let-7 in the cytoplasm of liver cancer cells and embryonic stem cells (Heo et al., 2008Heo I. Joo C. Cho J. Ha M. Han J.

The uridylated pre-let-7 (up-let-7) fails to be processed by Dicer and undergoes decay. Lin28 itself does not show any uridylation activity and does not contain a catalytic domain. Thus, Lin28 may recruit a ribonucleotidyl transferase, which can add ribonucleotides to the 3′ end of RNA substrates in a template-independent manner (Martin and Keller, 2007Martin G. Keller W.

Ribonucleotidyl transferases contain DNA polymerase β-like nucleotidyl transferase domains that are highly conserved. Best known members of this family are the canonical poly (A) polymerases (PAPs), which function in the polyadenylation of pre-mRNA in the nucleus. In the past few years, a new family of PAPs has emerged. This noncanonical PAP family is also known as the Cid1 family because the cytoplasmic PAP, Cid1, was the first identified member of noncanonical PAPs in fission yeast (Wang et al., 2000Wang S.W. Toda T. MacCallum R. Harris A.L. Norbury C. Cid1, a fission yeast protein required for S-M checkpoint control when DNA polymerase delta or epsilon is inactivated.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3234-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Noncanonical PAPs are conserved across eukaryotes (Stevenson and Norbury, 2006Stevenson A.L. Norbury C.J. The Cid1 family of non-canonical poly(A) polymerases.Yeast. 2006; 23: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In mammals, seven noncanonical PAPs have been predicted (Martin and Keller, 2007Martin G. Keller W. RNA-specific ribonucleotidyl transferases.RNA. 2007; 13: 1834-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Stevenson and Norbury, 2006Stevenson A.L. Norbury C.J.

Some noncanonical PAPs can utilize uridine triphosphate (UTP) instead of adenine triphosphate (ATP). Therefore, they are also called poly (U) polymerases (PUPs) or terminal uridylyl transferases (TUTases or TUTs) (Kwak and Wickens, 2007Kwak J.E. Wickens M.

A tail tale for U.Science. 2008; 319: 1344-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic PAP, GLD2 (also known as TUTase2 and PAPD4), functions in the polyadenylation of neuronal mRNAs at synapses (Rouhana et al., 2005Rouhana L. Wang L. Buter N. Kwak J.E. Schiltz C.A. Gonzalez T. Kelley A.E. Landry C.F. Wickens M. Vertebrate GLD2 poly(A) polymerases in the germline and the brain.RNA. 2005; 11: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, mouse GLD2 induces the translation of specific dormant mRNAs by adding poly (A) tails to the mRNAs during oogenesis (Nakanishi et al., 2006Nakanishi T. Kubota H. Ishibashi N. Kumagai S. Watanabe H. Yamashita M. Kashiwabara S. Miyado K. Baba T. Possible role of mouse poly(A) polymerase mGLD-2 during oocyte maturation.Dev. Biol. 2006; 289: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently, GLD2 was found to monoadenylate and stabilize mature miR-122 in mammalian liver cells (Katoh et al., 2009Katoh T. Sakaguchi Y. Miyauchi K. Suzuki T. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Selective stabilization of mammalian microRNAs by 3′ adenylation mediated by the cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase GLD-2.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). TUTase1 (also known as mtPAP, PAPD1, and Hs4) was reported to adenylate mitochondrial pre-mRNAs (Nagaike et al., 2005Nagaike T. Suzuki T. Katoh T. Ueda T.

TUTase3 (PAPD5 and TRF4-2) and TUTase1 uridylate histone mRNAs, leading to their decay at the end of early S phase (Mullen and Marzluff, 2008Mullen T.E. Marzluff W.F.

U6 TUTase (TUTase6, also known as PAPD2, Hs5, and TUT1) can add up to three uridyl groups to the 3′ end of U6 snRNAs and function in the recycling of U6 snRNA during splicing (Trippe et al., 2003Trippe R.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Trippe et al., 2006Trippe R. Guschina E. Hossbach M. Urlaub H. Luhrmann R. Benecke B.J. Identification, cloning, and functional analysis of the human U6 snRNA-specific terminal uridylyl transferase.RNA. 2006; 12: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here, we report that a noncanonical PAP, TUTase4 (TUT4, also known as ZCCHC11, Hs3, and PAPD3), functions as the uridylyl transferase for pre-miRNA. Lin28 interacts with pre-let-7 through a conserved sequence motif of GGAG in the terminal loop and recruits TUT4 to the pre-miRNA. TUT4 then adds a uridine tail to the 3′ end of pre-miRNA. Through this activity, TUT4 represses miRNA biogenesis in embryonic stem cells and consequently affects the maintenance of ES cells. We have previously reported that Lin28 induces the terminal uridylation of pre-let-7 (Heo et al., 2008Heo I. Joo C. Cho J. Ha M. Han J. Kim V.N. Lin28 mediates the terminal uridylation of let-7 precursor MicroRNA.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 276-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Because Lin28 itself does not possess uridylating activity, we suspected the existence of another factor that participates in let-7 suppression. To find this enzyme, we carried out RNA affinity purification by incubating immobilized pre-let-7a-1 with cell lysates from HEK293T cells transfected with the Lin28a expression plasmid (Figure 1A). We previously showed that the Lin28a-expressing HEK293T cells can support uridylation of pre-let-7 (Heo et al., 2008Heo I. Joo C. Cho J. Ha M. Han J. Kim V.N. Lin28 mediates the terminal uridylation of let-7 precursor MicroRNA.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 276-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), implying that the uridylating enzyme is present in HEK293T cells. The interacting proteins were identified with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Table S1 available online). As expected, Lin28a was efficiently pulled down. In addition, pre-let-7 precipitated another protein named TUT4. TUT4 belongs to a family of noncanonical PAPs and contains nucleotidyl transferase domains and C2H2- and CCHC-types of zinc finger domains. Although TUT4 has been reported to exhibit PUP activity on synthetic oligonucleotide in vitro, its natural target substrates and its cellular role as a PUP remains unknown (Kwak and Wickens, 2007Kwak J.E. Wickens M. A family of poly(U) polymerases.RNA. 2007; 13: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction between TUT4 and pre-let-7, we repeated the RNA affinity purification and the LC-MS/MS analysis with Huh7 cells where Lin28b is expressed endogenously. TUT4 was again identified in Huh7 cells as a protein interacting with pre-let-7 (data not shown). Considering its association with pre-let-7 and its PUP activity, we hypothesized that TUT4 is the uridylyl transferase for pre-let-7 elongation. Because the uridylated pre-let-7 (up-let-7) is resistant to Dicer processing and subject to decay (Heo et al., 2008Heo I. Joo C. Cho J. Ha M. Han J. Kim V.N. Lin28 mediates the terminal uridylation of let-7 precursor MicroRNA.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 276-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), it is expected that the uridylating enzyme will have an inhibitory effect on let-7 biogenesis. To test this, we transfected a mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell line R1 with siRNA against TUT4. After 48 hr of transfection, the miRNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The mature miRNA levels of let-7a, let-7g, and let-7f increased by 2- to 4-fold upon TUT4 knockdown, demonstrating the suppressive role of TUT4 in let-7 biogenesis (Figure 1B). On the contrary, the level of mature miR-16 did not change, suggesting that regulation by TUT4 is specific to let-7 family miRNAs. The let-7-specific change was also observed with another siRNA targeting a different position in TUT4 mRNA, excluding a possibility of off-target effects by siTUT4 (data not shown). In contrast to the significant increase of mature let-7, the levels of pri-let-7 remained unaltered in TUT4-depleted cells (Figure 1B). This suggests that TUT4 regulates let-7 biogenesis posttranscriptionally and that TUT4 does not affect Drosha processing. The knockdown of TUT4 did not cause differentiation of the stem cells in the time range of our experiment (48 hr), excluding the possibility that the observed upregulation of let-7 is a secondary effect of cell differentiation (Figure S1). In order to investigate the action mechanism of TUT4, we further analyzed the interaction between TUT4, Lin28, and pre-let-7. We first carried out RNA affinity purification as in Figure 1A. For this, either pre-let-7a-1 or pre-miR-16-1 was immobilized on beads and was incubated with extracts from HEK293T cells transfected with TUT4- and Lin28a-expression plasmids. We observed that TUT4 did not bind to pre-let-7 when it was expressed alone (Figure 2A, lane 3). But when Lin28 was coexpressed, TUT4 was precipitated with pre-let-7 (Figure 2A, lane 6). This suggests that TUT4 requires Lin28 to bind to pre-let-7. TUT4 did not associate with pre-miR-16 under any conditions. Lin28 can interact with pre-miR-16 to some degree but less avidly compared to pre-let-7. This weak interaction with pre-miR-16 appears to be nonspecific and nonfunctional because the inactive Lin28 mutant (Heo et al., 2008Heo I. Joo C. Cho J. Ha M. Han J. Kim V.N. Lin28 mediates the terminal uridylation of let-7 precursor MicroRNA.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 276-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) can also bind to pre-miR-16 at a similar affinity (Figure S9B). To confirm the Lin28 dependency of TUT4, we performed a similar RNA pull-down experiment with mES cells in which both Lin28a and TUT4 are endogenously expressed (Figure 2B). Lin28a and TUT4 were precipitated with pre-let-7 (Figure 2B, lane 3). However, after knockdown of Lin28a, TUT4 failed to associate with pre-let-7 efficiently (Figure 2B, lane 6). This again demonstrates that TUT4 interacts with pre-let-7 in a Lin28-dependent manner. We then asked whether Lin28 recruits TUT4 through direct protein-protein interaction. In order to test this, we transfected FLAG-TUT4 and V5-Lin28a expression plasmids into HEK293T cells, in which let-7 is transcribed at very low levels (Figure 2C). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-FLAG antibody, and the precipitated proteins were detected using anti-FLAG and anti-V5 antibodies. FLAG-TUT4 could not precipitate V5-Lin28, unless synthetic pre-let-7 was added into the extract (Figure 2C, lane 8–10). pre-miR-16 could not mediate the interaction between Lin28 and TUT4 (Figure 2C, lane 10). Thus, TUT4 specifically requires pre-let-7 to interact with Lin28. It was previously shown that purified recombinant Lin28 binds directly to pre-let-7 without any other protein cofactors (Piskounova et al., 2008Piskounova E. Viswanathan S.R. Janas M. LaPierre R.J. Daley G.Q. Sliz P. Gregory R.I. Determinants of microRNA processing inhibition by the developmentally regulated RNA-binding protein Lin28.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21310-21314Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TUT4 can interact with pre-let-7 and Lin28 only when they are present at the same time (Figure 2). These results suggest that Lin28 first recognizes pre-let-7 and, subsequently, TUT4 is recruited to the binary complex of Lin28 and pre-let-7. We then asked in which cellular compartment TUT4 localizes and functions. The nucleus and the cytoplasm were separated, and the protein levels were determined by western blotting (Figure 2D). TUT4 was detected mainly in the cytoplasmic fraction in both HEK293T and mES cells. The cytoplasmic localization of TUT4 was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry in Huh7 and HeLa cell lines using anti-TUT4 antibody (Figure S2). When the nuclear and the cytoplasmic extracts were incubated with immobilized pre-miRNA, we found that TUT4 binds efficiently to pre-let-7 in the cytoplasmic fraction but not in the nuclear fraction (Figure 2E). This is consistent with our previous observations that Lin28 acts mainly in the cytoplasm and that the pre-let-7 uridylating activity is detected in the cytoplasmic extract (Heo et al., 2008Heo I. Joo C. Cho J. Ha M. Han J. Kim V.N. Lin28 mediates the terminal uridylation of let-7 precursor MicroRNA.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 276-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Therefore, the data show that TUT4 and Lin28 act together to suppress let-7 biogenesis in the cytoplasm. In previous experiments, we recapitulated the uridylation reaction of pre-let-7 in vitro by incubating synthetic pre-let-7 and recombinant Lin28 protein with HEK293T cell extract (Heo et al., 2008Heo I. Joo C. Cho J. Ha M. Han J. Kim V.N. Lin28 mediates the terminal uridylation of let-7 precursor MicroRNA.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 276-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In order to examine whether TUT4 is indeed the factor that is responsible for the uridylating activity in the cell extract, TUT4 was immunopurified and incubated with recombinant Lin28 and synthetic pre-let-7a-1 (Figure 3A). The uridylated pre-let-7a-1 (up-let-7a-1) band of ∼100 nt appeared only when both TUT4 and Lin28 were included in the reaction. This up-let-7a-1 band was similar in size to the band that had previously been d"

Here, we reveal a structural organization distinct from this traditional hierarchy by statistical analysis of correlated evolution between amino acids. Applied to the S1A serine proteases, the analysis indicates a decomposition of the protein into three quasi-independent groups of correlated amino acids that we term “protein sectors.” Each sector is physically connected in the tertiary structure, has a distinct functional role, and constitutes an independent mode of sequence divergence in the protein family. Functionally relevant sectors are evident in other protein families as well, suggesting that they may be general features of proteins. We propose that sectors represent a structural organization of proteins that reflects their evolutionary histories.

Here, we intend the term “biological properties” to broadly encompass chemical activity, structural stability, and other features that may be under selective pressure. A standard measure of the importance of protein residues is sequence conservation—the degree to which the frequency of amino acids at a given position deviates from random expectation in a well-sampled multiple sequence alignment of the protein family (Capra and Singh, 2007Capra J.A. Singh M. Predicting functionally important residues from sequence conservation.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 1875-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, Ng and Henikoff, 2006Ng P.C. Henikoff S.

The more unexpected the amino acid distribution at a position, the stronger the inference of evolutionary constraint and therefore of biological importance. However, protein structure and function also depend on the cooperative action of amino acids, indicating that amino acid distributions at positions cannot be taken as independent of one another (Gobel et al., 1994Gobel U.

A more informative formulation of sequence conservation should be to include pairwise or even higher-order correlations between sequence positions—the statistical signature of conserved interactions between residues. Indeed, analyses of correlations have contributed to the identification of allosteric mechanisms in proteins (Ferguson et al., 2007Ferguson A.D. Amezcua C.A. Halabi N.M. Chelliah Y. Rosen M.K.

These findings motivate a deeper theoretical and experimental analysis of correlations of sequence positions with the goal of understanding how protein sequences encode the basic conserved biological properties of a protein family. Here, we carry out this analysis using a classic model system for enzyme catalysis, the S1A family of serine proteases (Hedstrom, 2002Hedstrom L. Serine protease mechanism and specificity.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, Rawlings and Barrett, 1994Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J.

MEROPS: the peptidase database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D320-D325Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). We find that the nonrandom correlations between sequence positions indicate a decomposition of the protein into groups of coevolving amino acids that we term “sectors.” In the S1A proteases, the sectors are nearly statistically independent, are physically connected in the tertiary structure, are associated with different biochemical properties, and have diverged independently in the evolution of the protein family. Functionally relevant and physically contiguous sectors are evident in other protein domains as well, providing a basis for directing further experimentation using the principles outlined in the serine protease family. Overall, our data support two main findings: (1) protein domains have a heterogeneous internal organization of amino acid interactions that can comprise multiple functionally distinct subdivisions (the sectors), and (2) these sectors define a decomposition of proteins that is distinct from the hierarchy of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure. We propose that the sectors are features of protein structures than reflect the evolutionary histories of their conserved biological properties. The S1A family consists primarily of enzymes catalyzing peptide bond hydrolysis through a conserved chemical mechanism, but its members show a broad range of substrate specificities and environments within which they operate. Analysis of positional conservation (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures) in a multiple sequence alignment of 1470 members of the family reveals a pattern over sequence positions (Figure 1A) that has a simple and well-known structural interpretation: more conserved positions tend to be located in the core of the protein or at functional surfaces, and less conserved positions tend to occur on the remainder of the protein surface (Figures 1B and 1C) (Bowie et al., 1990Bowie J.U.

To examine the contribution of correlations to conservation, we followed the statistical coupling analysis (SCA) approach (Lockless and Ranganathan, 1999Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Evolutionarily conserved pathways of energetic connectivity in protein families.Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) to compute a conservation-weighted covariance matrix between all sequence positions in the S1A family (C˜ij, Figure 1D, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Inspection of the matrix clearly indicates that correlations are not simply dominated by proximity in primary structure; many positions show only weak correlation to neighboring positions but significant correlation to positions that are distant along the sequence (Figure 1D). What pattern of functional correlations within the serine protease does this matrix indicate? The essence of addressing this problem is two-fold: (1) to separate the functionally significant correlations in the C˜ij matrix (the “signal”) from correlations that could arise due to limited sampling of sequences (“statistical noise”) or phylogenetic relationships between sequences (“historical noise”), and then (2) to analyze the pattern of the remaining significant correlations. Our approach for isolating signal from noise in the SCA correlation matrix derives from work more than 50 years ago on random matrix theory (Wigner, 1967Wigner E.P. Random matrices in physics.SIAM Rev. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1967; 9: 1-23Google Scholar). The basic idea is to model the effect of statistical noise by examining correlation matrices for randomized versions of the data; significant patterns of correlations are then deduced by comparison. This approach was used in finance to extract nonrandom correlations of stock performance over a finite time window (Bouchaud and Potters, 2004Bouchaud J.-P. Potters M. Theory of Financial Risk and Derivative Pricing: From Statistical Physics to Risk Management.Second Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2004Google Scholar, Plerou et al., 2002Plerou V. Gopikrishnan P. Rosenow B. Amaral L.A. Guhr T. Stanley H.E. Random matrix approach to cross correlations in financial data.Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2002; 65: 066126Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar). This analysis showed that only a small fraction of observed correlations are relevant because most could arise simply by the limited period of time over which stock prices are sampled. The remaining significant correlations are organized in a few collective modes that decompose the economy into business sectors—groups of business entities whose performance fluctuates together over time. We applied these same methods to extract the nonrandom correlated modes of the SCA matrix, effectively “cleaning” the matrix of statistical noise (Figure S2A available online). As for the financial markets, we find that only a few top modes (five out of 223 total) contain correlations that are clearly distinct from random expectation. The work in finance also provides a clue for reducing the effect of historical noise. Global, coherent correlations in stock performance occur due to fluctuations in the overall economy and are responsible for a dominant first mode of the correlation matrix. This mode is irrelevant for identifying the nonglobal, heterogeneous correlations between stocks that define the different business sectors and is therefore removed (Bouchaud and Potters, 2004Bouchaud J.-P. Potters M. Theory of Financial Risk and Derivative Pricing: From Statistical Physics to Risk Management.Second Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2004Google Scholar, Plerou et al., 2002Plerou V. Gopikrishnan P. Rosenow B. Amaral L.A. Guhr T. Stanley H.E. Random matrix approach to cross correlations in financial data.Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2002; 65: 066126Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Similarly, global, coherent correlations between positions should occur due to phylogenetic relationships between sequences and are expected to produce the dominant first mode observed for the SCA matrix (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Discussion). This mode is irrelevant for decomposing the protein sequence into functional units and is removed. Though the principles of computing correlations vary, similar approaches for partial elimination of purely phylogenetic correlations in protein sequence alignments have been previously described (Atchley et al., 2000Atchley W.R. Wollenberg K.R. Fitch W.M. Terhalle W. Dress A.W. Correlations among amino acid sites in bHLH protein domains: an information theoretic analysis.Mol. Biol.

Kolinski A. Rotkiewicz P. Ilkowski B. Skolnick J. Ab initio folding of proteins using restraints derived from evolutionary information.Proteins. 1999; : 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The process is summarized in the Experimental Procedures, and a script for reproducing this analysis is provided in the Supplemental Data. The final result is shown in Figure 1E, a highly simplified representation of the SCA matrix that shows the statistically relevant pattern of correlation. For the S1A family, this analysis reveals two main findings: (1) the 223 sequence positions in the multiple sequence alignment are reduced to 65 positions that show significant patterns of correlations, and (2) these 65 positions can be separated into three seemingly distinct groups (labeled red, blue, and green). By analogy with the work in finance, and to distinguish from other terminologies used in describing protein structures, we refer to these groups of correlated positions as protein sectors—units of a protein that have coevolved within a protein family. The concept of business sectors in the economy is clear, but what is the meaning of sectors in proteins? Using the S1A family as a model system, we identify four characteristics of sectors: (1) statistical independence, (2) physical connectivity in the tertiary structure, (3) biochemical independence in mediating protein function, and (4) independent phenotypic variation in the protein family. Figure 1E provides a qualitative picture of independence between sectors in the S1A family, but quantitatively, how independent are they? To address this, we computed a measure called the correlation entropy—the degree to which a selected group of residues are statistically coupled to each other in the multiple sequence alignment (Figures 2 and S6, and see the Supplemental Discussion). If two sectors are independent, then the correlation entropy of two taken together must be the sum of their correlation entropies taken individually. Figure 2 shows that for all pairs of sectors (Figures 2A–2C) and for the three sectors combined (Figure 2D), this condition holds to a remarkable degree. For example, the correlation entropy of the red and blue sectors taken together (Figure 2A, black bar) is nearly that of the sum of the individual sector correlation entropies (stacked red and blue bars), and much different from random expectation (gray bar). Overall, the data in Figures 2A–2D show that the red, blue, and green sectors represent highly independent statistical units in the serine protease family. This analysis also permits a quantitative comparison of the degree of independence; the red/blue and green/blue sectors emerge as the most independent (Figures 2A and 2B), while the red and green sectors show less independence (Figure 2C). For example, G216 and V213 are jointly shared by both the red and green sectors (Figure S3F), suggesting that they represent sites of interaction between these two otherwise independent sectors. The identification of independent protein sectors in the serine protease is entirely based on statistical analysis of the sequence alignment without any consideration of the protein structure or its biochemical properties. Nevertheless, the sectors have clearly interpretable tertiary structural properties (Figure 3). The red sector comprises a contiguous network of amino acids built around the S1 pocket, the primary determinant of substrate specificity (Hedstrom, 2002Hedstrom L. Serine protease mechanism and specificity.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). The color gradient in Figure 3A represents residue weights, revealing a tertiary structural organization in which the strongest contributors are centered around the S1 pocket and weaker positions comprise the surrounding. This sector includes residues in the environment of the S1 pocket that are known to contribute to its mechanical stability, providing a rationale for their cooperative action (Bush-Pelc et al., 2007Bush-Pelc L.A.

Structural origins of substrate discrimination in trypsin and chymotrypsin.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This sector is clearly involved in catalytic specificity; mutation of residues comprising this sector are known to influence specificity for substrates in several S1A family members (Craik et al., 1985Craik C.S.

The role of the Cys191-Cys220 disulfide bond in trypsin: new targets for engineering substrate specificity.Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and this sector correlates well with positions mutated in transferring chymotryptic specificity into trypsin (Hedstrom et al., 1994Hedstrom L. Perona J.J. Rutter W.J. Converting trypsin to chymotrypsin: residue 172 is a substrate specificity determinant.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8757-8763Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The blue sector comprises another contiguous group of amino acids, but is structurally distinct from the red sector; the constituent residues run through the interior of both of the β barrels that comprise the core structure of the protease (Figure 3B), but also extend from both β barrels to directly contact the catalytic triad residues (Figure 4B). Mapping of residue weights in this sector indicates a few foci joined by intervening positions with lower weights, as if the activity of this sector is a more distributed rather than localized property of the protein structure. Unlike the red sector, prior work establishes no unified role for this sector, likely because blue sector residues are not obviously distinguishable from the general milieu of residues in the protein core that are similarly conserved and well-packed (Figures 4 and S7). Finally, the green sector forms another contiguous group of amino acids, located at the interface between the two β barrels that make up the protease (Figure 3C). Residues within this sector include the catalytic triad (H57, D102, and S195), and surrounding residues known to be important for the basic chemical mechanism of this enzyme family (Baird et al., 2006Baird Jr., T.T. Wright W.D. Craik C.S. Conversion of trypsin to a functional threonine protease.Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Hedstrom, 2002Hedstrom L. Serine protease mechanism and specificity.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), and for some forms of allosteric control over this activity (Guinto et al., 1999Guinto E.R. Caccia S. Rose T. Futterer K.

USA. 1999; 96: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, Huntington and Esmon, 2003Huntington J.A. Esmon C.T. The molecular basis of thrombin allostery revealed by a 1.8 A structure of the “slow” form.Structure. 2003; 11: 469-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Like the red sector, residue weights are largest around a hotspot (the catalytic residues), and fall off in surrounding positions. This sector includes one disulfide bond pair (C42-C58), substitution of which has been shown to cooperatively interact with mutation of S195 (Baird et al., 2006Baird Jr., T.T. Wright W.D. Craik C.S. Conversion of trypsin to a functional threonine protease.Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Indeed, triple mutation of C42A, C58A/V, and S195T is sufficient to convert trypsin from a serine protease to a threonine protease. We conclude that the green sector represents the catalytic core of the protease family. Consistent with joint contribution to both the red and green sectors, positions 213 and 216 are found to form a major part of the packing interface between these two sectors (data not shown). More generally, the physical connectivity of each sector is striking, given that no information about tertiary structure was used in their identification and that only ∼10% of total sequence positions contribute strongly to each sector. Shown together, the three sectors occupy largely distinct subdivisions within the core of the tertiary structure, making contacts only at a few positions (Figures 4B–4D). The considerable prior experimental work on the serine proteases permits the partial functional interpretation of sectors provided above, but it is important to note that the sectors are otherwise not obvious. No sector corresponds to any known subdivision of proteins by primary structure segments, secondary structure elements, or subdomain architecture (Figure 4A). In addition, the three sectors are not distinguishable by degree of solvent exposure, by the conservation of positions taken independently, or with the obvious exception of the green sector, by proximity to the active site (Figure 4). What is the functional meaning of independence between protein sectors? To address this question, we carried out alanine mutagenesis of residues spanning the range of correlation strengths in the red and blue sectors in rat trypsin and measured the effect on two basic properties of these enzymes: catalytic power and thermal stability. Catalytic power was measured using a standard chromophore-based assay on a model trypsin substrate peptide (NH2-AAPK-pNA) (Hedstrom et al., 1994Hedstrom L. Perona J.J. Rutter W.J. Converting trypsin to chymotrypsin: residue 172 is a substrate specificity determinant.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8757-8763Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and stability by following the denaturation temperature (Tm) using the fluorescence of buried tryptophan residues as a probe for the native state (Figures S8–S10 and Table S2). Consistent with prior work (Hedstrom, 2002Hedstrom L. Serine protease mechanism and specificity.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), we find that mutations in the red sector have significant effect on catalytic activity (red circles, Figure 5A). However, mutations in this sector have only minor effect on thermal stability. The same result holds for a multiple mutant in the red sector (Hswap, Figure 5B), in which a large number of red sector positions are exchanged for corresponding amino acids in chymotrypsin (Hedstrom et al., 1994Hedstrom L. Perona J.J. Rutter W.J. Converting trypsin to chymotrypsin: residue 172 is a substrate specificity determinant.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8757-8763Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Strikingly, blue sector mutations have the opposite phenotype—a wide range of effects on thermal stability, but only marginal effect on catalytic activity (Figure 5A, blue circles). Double alanine mutants within the blue sector reinforce this result: these proteins show exclusive effects on thermal stability, with little or no effect on catalytic activity (Figure 5B). In addition, the data suggest that mutations within the sector act cooperatively. For example, L105A and T229A destabilize trypsin by 10.4 K and 8.0 K, respectively, but the effects of these mutations are reduced or abrogated in the background of M104A, an indication of epistatic interactions within this sector. These findings are structurally nontrivial; some blue sector positions (e.g., M104, T229) are as close to catalytic residues as some red sector positions (e.g., C191, G216) and are just as buried (Figures 4C and 4D), but nevertheless show distinct functional properties upon mutation. One further experiment tests the independence of the red and blue sectors in affecting structural stability and catalytic activity. If these groups act independently, then combinations of mutations between these two groups should show additive effects on measured parameters. Figure 5C confirms this prediction for two pairs of intersector mutations; the measured effect of the double mutants (magenta circles) is nearly that predicted from the single mutant experiments (white circles). Thus, the red and blue sectors are associated with near-independent biochemical properties of the protease. A small sampling of nonsector mutants in the core of trypsin shows little effects on either catalytic activity or thermal stability (white circles, Figure 5A). Further work will be required to more broadly test the role of conserved but nonsector positions in contributing to protease function. In addition, one aspect of the mutational effects in the blue sector is worth noting. Blue sector mutants affect thermal stability, but it is possible that this may actually reflect changes in the local stability of regions involved in functional processes such as control over protease lifetime through autocatalytic degradation. Consistent with this notion, the C136-C201 disulfide bond and other blue sector positions are located in regions that flank known autocatalytic sites (Bodi et al., 2001Bodi A. Kaslik G. Venekei I.

Here, we report that LSD1 is an integral component of the Mi-2/nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Transcriptional target analysis revealed that the LSD1/NuRD complexes regulate several cellular signaling pathways including TGFβ1 signaling pathway that are critically involved in cell proliferation, survival, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. We demonstrated that LSD1 inhibits the invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro and suppresses breast cancer metastatic potential in vivo. We found that LSD1 is downregulated in breast carcinomas and that its level of expression is negatively correlated with that of TGFβ1. Our data provide a molecular basis for the interplay of histone demethylation and deacetylation in chromatin remodeling. By enlisting LSD1, the NuRD complex expands its chromatin remodeling capacity to include ATPase, histone deacetylase, and histone demethylase."

However, the miRNA expression signature in the early phase of AMI has not been identified. In this study, the miRNA expression signature was investigated in rat hearts 6 h after AMI.

Remarkably, miR-21 expression was significantly down-regulated in infarcted areas, but was up-regulated in border areas.

Functionally, an individual miRNA is as important as a transcription factor because it is able to regulate the expression of its multiple target genes. As a group, miRNAs are estimated to regulate over 30% of the genes in a cell (14Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P.

It is thus not surprising that miRNAs are involved in the regulation of almost all major cellular functions including apoptosis and necrosis, which are two key cellular events in acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Med. 2007; 13: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) have found that the expression of a cardiac arrhythmia-related miRNA, miR-1, is increased in human hearts with coronary heart disease and in rat hearts with AMI. The results of miR-1 expression change in human hearts with coronary artery disease are still controversial, because another recent study has demonstrated that the miR-1 expression tends to be down-regulated in human hearts with coronary artery disease (16Ikeda S. Kong S.W. Lu J. Bisping E. Zhang H. Allen P.D. Golub T.R. Pieske B. Pu W.T. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 31: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The potential involvement of miRNAs in AMI is also suggested in a study using miR-126 null mice, in which Wang et al. (17Wang S. Aurora A.B. Johnson B.A. Qi X. McAnally J. Hill J.A. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar) have found that the survival rate in miR-126-deficient mice following AMI is significantly reduced compared with that in wild-type mice. The expression signature in the late phase of AMI (3 and 14 days after AMI) has just been identified by an excellent study reported by van Rooij et al. (18van Rooij E. Sutherland L.B. Thatcher J.E. DiMaio J.M. Naseem R.H. Marshall W.S. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13027-13032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). These investigators found that miR-29 plays an important role in cardiac fibrosis during the repair process after AMI. During manuscript preparation, another excellent study was reported by Kukreja's group (19Yin C. Wang X. Kukreja R.C. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In an in vitro ischemia/reperfusion injury model, they have found that, in mouse hearts preinjected with heat shock-induced miRNAs including miR-21, myocardial infarct size after ischemia/reperfusion injury in vitro is reduced. Still, the miRNA expression signature in the early phase of AMI has not been identified. Moreover, the potential effects of miRNA treatment on myocardial infarct size in an in vivo AMI model have not been investigated. The objective of the current study was to determine the expression signatures of different areas in infarcted rat hearts at 6 h after AMI and to investigate the role of an aberrantly expressed miRNA, miR-21, in AMI and its potential cellular and molecular mechanisms. To determine the miRNA expression changes in infarcted hearts, we applied a well established rat AMI model using left coronary artery ligation as described (20Eckle T. Grenz A. Köhler D. Redel A. Falk M. Rolauffs B. Osswald H. Kehl F. Eltzschig H.K. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 291: H2533-H2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In brief, 10-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 250–300 g) were anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and xylazine (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Under sterile conditions, an anterior transmural AMI was created by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery with a silk suture. Sham-operated rats served as controls. Sham operation involved an identical procedure, except the suture was passed around the vessel without left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. IP was achieved via four cycles of 5-min coronary occlusion/5-min reperfusion cycles of the left anterior descending coronary artery as described (21Tang X.L. Sato H. Tiwari S. Dawn B. Bi Q. Li Q. Shirk G. Bolli R. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 291: H2308-H2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School, and were consistent with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health publication 85-23). At 6 and 24 h after the occlusion of the coronary artery, the rats were anesthetized and 6 ml of 1% Evans blue dye was injected into the vena cava to delineate the noninfarcted portion of the heart. The myocardial ischemic area at risk was identified as the region lacking blue staining. The ventricles of the hearts were sliced transversely into 2-mm thick slices. The slices were incubated in 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37 °C for 30 min to identify the noninfarcted and infarcted areas. Infarct size was expressed as a percentage of the ischemic area at risk. In myocardial slices, noninfarcted area was defined as the Evans blue-stained area. The infarcted area was displayed as the TTC unstained area. The border area was identified as Evans blue unstained and TTC-stained areas. Two weeks after AMI, the anesthetized rat hearts were arrested in diastole by an intravenous injection of saturated potassium chloride solution via the left jugular vein. The dimensions of the LV were measured in transverse slices at the level of papillary muscle as described (22Kolakowski Jr., S. Berry M.F. Atluri P. Grand T. Fisher O. Moise M.A. Cohen J. Hsu V.

Cardiol. 2004; 99: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). miRNAs were isolated from the infarcted, border, and noninfarcted areas of rat left ventricles at 6 h after left anterior descending coronary artery ligation using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Inc.). Left ventricular miRNAs isolated from the sham group were used as the sham controls. In addition, one group of miRNAs were isolated from rat left ventricles at 6 h after IP. Each group had six rats, and miRNA expression profiling was done by miRNA microarray analysis using a chip containing 341 mature miRNAs (Chip ID miRRat 12.0 version; LC Sciences) (24Cheng Y. Liu X. Zhang S. Lin Y. Yang J. Zhang C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2009; 47: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 25Ji R. Cheng Y. Yue J. Yang J. Liu X. Chen H. Dean D.B. Zhang C. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The miRNA expression was demonstrated by the mean of the 6 biological replicates. Proprietary “spike-in” controls were used at each step of the process. The adenovirus expressing miR-21 (Ad-miR-21), PDCD4 (Ad-PDCD4), or control adenovirus expressing GFP (Ad-GFP) were generated using the Adeno-XTM Expression Systems 2 kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocols. These adenoviruses were purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation and titrated using a standard plaque assay. Ad-miR-21 or Ad-GFP were delivered into the rat hearts 3 days before AMI as described (26Hajjar R.J. Schmidt U. Matsui T. Guerrero J.L. Lee K.H. Gwathmey J.K. Dec G.W. Semigran M.J. Rosenzweig A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5251-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and xylazine (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The pericardium was opened via the third intercostal space. The aorta and pulmonary artery were identified. A 23-gauge catheter containing 200 μl of adenovirus was advanced from the apex of the left ventricle to the aortic root. The aorta and pulmonary arteries were clamped distal to the site of the catheter and the solution was injected. The clamp was maintained for 10 s when the heart pumped against a closed system (isovolumically). This procedure allows the solution that contains the adenovirus to circulate down the coronary arteries and perfuse the heart. After 10 s, clamps on the aorta and pulmonary artery were released and the chest was closed. Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac ventricular myocytes were performed as described previously (12Bentwich I. Avniel A. Karov Y. Aharonov R. Gilad S. Barad O. Barzilai A. Einat P. Einav U. Meiri E. Sharon E. Spector Y. Bentwich Z. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). In brief, hearts from 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were placed in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline solution. After repeated rinsing, the atria were cut off, and the ventricles were minced with scissors. The minced tissue and ventricular cells were dispersed by digestion with collagenase type IV (0.45 mg/ml), 0.1% trypsin, and 15 μg/ml DNase I. Cardiomyocytes (0.33 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured in cardiac myocyte culture medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, 4 μg/ml of transferrin, 0.7 ng/ml of sodium selenite, 2 g/liter of bovine serum albumin, 3 mmol/liter of pyruvic acid, 15 mmol/liter of HEPES, 100 μmol/liter of ascorbic acid, 100 μg/ml of ampicillin, 5 μg/ml of linoleic acid, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, and 100 μmol/liter 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine and seeded into six-well plates. Cell ischemic injury, induced by hypoxia in a serum- and glucose-free medium, and reoxygenation (H/R) was performed as described (27Cho M.A. Lee M.K. Nam K.H. Chung W.Y. Park C.S. Lee J.H. Noh T. Yang W.I. Rhee Y. Lim S.K. Lee H.C. Lee E.J. J. Endocrinol. 2007; 195: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hypoxia was achieved by placing the cells in a hypoxia chamber filled with 5% CO2 and 95% N2 at 37 °C for 4 h. Following hypoxia exposure, the cells were reoxygenated with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% serum and normal glucose. Oligo transfection was performed according to an established protocol (24Cheng Y. Liu X. Zhang S. Lin Y. Yang J. Zhang C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2009; 47: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 25Ji R. Cheng Y. Yue J. Yang J. Liu X. Chen H. Dean D.B. Zhang C. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). For the miR-21 knockdown, miR-21 inhibitor (LNA-anti-miR-21) (Exiqon, Inc.) was added to the culture medium at a final oligonucleotide concentration of 30 nm. For miR-21 up-regulation, pre-miR-21 (Ambion, Inc.) was added directly to the complexes at a final oligonucleotide concentration of 30 nm. PDCD4 gene up-regulation was performed by Ad-PDCD4 (30 m.o.i.). The transfection medium was replaced 4 h post-transfection by regular culture medium. Vehicle control, oligo controls for LNA-anti-miR-21 and pre-miR-21 (Ambion, Inc.), and adenovirus control (Ad-GFP) were applied. Some aberrantly expressed miRNAs in infarcted hearts were further confirmed by qRT-PCR (24Cheng Y. Liu X. Zhang S. Lin Y. Yang J. Zhang C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2009; 47: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 25Ji R. Cheng Y. Yue J. Yang J. Liu X. Chen H. Dean D.B. Zhang C. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Moreover, as miR-21 is the selected miRNA for the study, its expression in sham-opened hearts and in different areas of the infarcted hearts was determined at 6 and 24 h after AMI. In addition, qRT-PCR was also used to determine the miR-21 levels in cultured cells. qRT-PCR was performed on cDNA generated from 50 ng of total RNA using the protocol of the mirVana qRT-PCR miRNA Detection Kit (Ambion, Inc). Amplification and detection of specific products were performed with a Roche Lightcycler 480 Detection System. As an internal control, U6 was used for template normalization. The primers used were provided by Ambion, Inc. Fluorescent signals were normalized to an internal reference, and the threshold cycle (Ct) was set within the exponential phase of the PCR. The relative gene expression was calculated by comparing cycle times for each target PCR. The target PCR Ct values were normalized by subtracting the U6 Ct value, which provided the ΔCt value. The relative expression level between treatments was then calculated using the following equation: relative gene expression = 2−(ΔCt,sample-ΔCt,control). Proteins isolated from cultured cardiac myocytes were determined by Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. A standard Western blot analysis was conducted using PDCD4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (1:5000 dilution; Cell Signaling) was used as the loading control. Activator protein 1 (AP-1) activity was measured using luciferase assay as described (28Hwang S.K. Jin H. Kwon J.T. Chang S.H. Kim T.H. Cho C.S. Lee K.H. Young M.R. Colburn N.H. Beck Jr., G.R. Yang H.S. Cho M.H. Gene Ther. 2007; 14: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, adenoviral vector (Ad-AP1-Luc) controlled by a synthetic promoter with direct repeats of the transcription recognition sequences for AP-1 was purchased from Vector Biolabs. Cultured cardiac myocytes pretreated with vehicle, control oligos (30 nm), LNA-anti-miR-21 (30 nm), pre-miR-21 (30 nm), Ad-GFP (30 m.o.i.), or Ad-PDCD4 (30 m.o.i.) for 4 h were transfected with Ad-AP1-Luc for 5 h with 10 pfu/cell. Luciferase activity was measured after 24 h using a scintillation counter and normalized to protein levels. Cultured cardiac myocyte apoptosis and apoptosis in heart sections were measured by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining as described previously (24Cheng Y. Liu X. Zhang S. Lin Y. Yang J. Zhang C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2009; 47: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 25Ji R. Cheng Y. Yue J. Yang J. Liu X. Chen H. Dean D.B. Zhang C. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Briefly, cardiac myocytes cultured on coverslips in 24-well plates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. In heart tissue, TUNEL staining was performed in frozen heart sections (8 μm). The TUNEL staining was done using the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The numbers of TUNEL-positive cells and the total cells in infarcted and border areas were counted under a fluorescence microscope. The infarcted, border, and noninfarcted areas were identified by histology in hematoxylin and eosin-stained heart sections. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. For relative gene expression, the mean value of the vehicle control group was defined as 100% or 1. Two-tailed unpaired Student's t tests and analysis of variance were used for statistical evaluation of the data. The Sigma stat statistical analysis program was used for data analysis. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Compared with those in the noninfarcted areas, miRNAs were aberrantly expressed in both infarcted (Table 1) and border areas (Table 2) of the infarcted hearts at 6 h after AMI. Among the 341 arrayed miRNAs, 38 miRNAs were differentially expressed (21 up and 17 down) in the infarcted areas with over 30% change and p value <0.01. In the border areas, 33 miRNAs were differentially expressed (19 up and 14 down). Although most of the miRNAs had a similar expression in the noninfarcted area of the infarcted hearts compared with the sham-opened controls, the expression of some miRNAs in the two groups was still different. Among them, miR-21, miR-27a, miR-27b, miR-30b-5p, miR-30c, miR-125a-5p, miR-126, mir-150, miR-26a, and miR-26b were up-regulated, but miR-107, miR-130a, miR-145, miR-16, and miR-22 were down-regulated in the noninfarcted areas of the infarcted hearts.TABLE 1Aberrant expression of miRNAs in the infarcted area of rat hearts at 6 h after AMImiRNAsExpression in noninfarcted areaExpression in infarcted areaNoninfarcted valuep valueMeanS.E.MeanS.E.%miR-30e1,1431304248037.113.78E-09miR-4517381052919439.481.51E-05miR-29c288531262643.632.17E-07miR-99a414841834344.271.46E-06miR-4996721003556352.837.96E-07miR-199a-3p1,0241625448253.115.41E-07miR-100252541422456.332.45E-05miR-25445362535456.951.94E-05miR-164,1113872,36125257.441.01E-08miR-92a314451813457.823.48E-06miR-1433,0692611,81116259.011.75E-09miR-245,3123763,33740262.833.56E-07miR-133,5981,32021,4301,10863.791.22E-08miR-1951,9201321,24916465.051.67E-06miR-12611,6207217,90891668.061.57E-06miR-211,1251034485639.803.74E-03miR-125b-5p3,5403132,47426769.892.31E-06miR-133b6,3472998,4881,099133.721.80E-04miR-3781,2301461,688220137.188.59E-05miR-1454,4662546,771484151.622.02E-09let-7e1,3991862,387625170.641.46E-04let-7d5,4715649,463532172.962.09E-07miR-328612510717176.188.06E-03miR-181a737941,300145176.286.95E-08miR-26b8841481,632308184.632.89E-06miR-3207781101,448171185.984.05E-08miR-2148891351,709210192.293.80E-08miR-146a537601,096123204.031.37E-09miR-181c451510216225.338.18E-05miR-674-5p671819936295.129.90E-08miR-223562321064373.662.69E-06miR-206852342988505.567.44E-09miR-35211840611204515.904.50E-08miR-6729635720234749.538.90E-08miR-466b169189551208.081.54E-05miR-188247343481455.515.43E-11miR-327113183451728.841.31E-03miR-2901671,88012011899.492.56E-04 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Aberrant expression of miRNAs in border area of the rat hearts at 6 h after AMImiRNAsExpression in noninfarcted areaExpression in border areaNoninfarcted valuep valueMeanS.E.MeanS.E.%miR-130a403841283031.729.44E-08miR-221,7821817305940.972.81E-12miR-2148891354835254.411.52E-07miR-107591223322156.202.51E-11miR-1433,0692611,74114656.734.74E-10miR-133,5981,32019,24485357.282.92E-11miR-181a7379442410957.491.75E-04miR-3781,2301467233558.772.47E-07miR-103639663822559.761.17E-08miR-199a-3p1,0241626694065.344.20E-05miR-99a414842832868.198.88E-04miR-99b390742683668.694.76E-04miR-245,3123763,65624068.836.70E-09let-7c12,2101,1068,45248969.223.53E-04miR-27b1,6231612,171197133.753.03E-05miR-30a1,4431021,922141133.134.96E-07miR-146a5376081858152.264.58E-07miR-27a1,1801131,935129163.954.13E-09miR-1501,1991011,982120165.348.09E-10miR-92b751913117174.241.30E-04miR-2111251191,976176175.693.35E-09miR-146b571112721222.112.45E-07miR-3221615037429232.406.41E-05miR-29c2885367769234.643.37E-08miR-30b-5p1,5341853,664351238.804.20E-11miR-125a-5p500771,23184246.183.10E-08miR-26b8841482,641248298.851.08E-09miR-4996721002,038131303.293.14E-09miR-3521184055141465.179.47E-07miR-2235623502108892.021.24E-08miR-12215322391497.623.45E-03miR-290167304641923.272.00E-03 Open table in a new tab Some aberrantly expressed miRNAs in infarcted areas were further verified by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1). Remarkably, miR-21 expression in the infarcted areas was significantly decreased compared with that in noninfarcted area. To further determine the expression changes of miR-21 in the different areas of the infarcted hearts and its time course response in the early phase of AMI, miRNAs were isolated in the different areas of the infarcted hearts as well as in sham-opened hearts at 6 and 24 h after AMI. As shown in Fig. 2, miR-21 expression was down-regulated in the infarcted areas at both 6 (Fig. 2A) and 24 h (Fig. 2B) after AMI compared with that in other areas and in sham-opened hearts. Interestingly, compared with that in other areas and in sham-opened hearts, miR-21 expression in border areas was significantly increased. In addition, miR-21 expression in noninfarcted areas of the infarcted hearts was also higher than that in sham-opened hearts. IP is a well established method to protect the heart against myocardial infarction. To further explore the pathological involvement of miR-21 in AMI, the effect of IP on miR-21 was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2C, 6 h after IP, the expression in non-infarcted rat hearts was increased. In IP-pretreated infarcted rat hearts, the down-regulated expression of miR-21 in infarcted areas was reversed. In border and noninfarcted areas, IP resulted in an additional increase in miR-21 expression in hearts at 6 h after AMI (Fig. 2C). The effects of IP on the expression of miRNAs that were aberrantly expressed in the infarcted area of the rat hearts determined by microarray analysis are listed in Table 3.TABLE 3The effects of IP on the expression of miRNAs that are aberrantly expressed in the infarcted area of the rat heartsmiRNAsExpression in sham-opened heartsExpression in IP heartsSham controlp valueMeanS.E.MeanS.E.%miR-211,6022265,812263362.860.00E+00miR-162,4912474,203266168.698.44E-13miR-26a23,3941,39316,06478868.673.44E-11miR-3528152953169338.768.32E-08miR-3201,0781582,333141216.310.00E+00let-7e2,7034164,211521155.795.98E-13miR-2144148681288195.953.20E-10miR-12627,0901,35718,4201,28667.995.34E-12miR-4993,4967689139926.113.33E-16 Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 3A, at 3 days after administration, Ad-miR-21 increased miR-21 expression in rat hearts in a dose-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2121966104,"Decades ago it was proposed that exocytosis involves invagination of the target membrane, resulting in a highly localized site of contact between the bilayers destined to fuse. The vesicle protein synaptotagmin-I (syt) bends membranes in response to Ca2+, but whether this drives localized invagination of the target membrane to accelerate fusion has not been determined. Previous studies relied on reconstituted vesicles that were already highly curved and used mutations in syt that were not selective for membrane-bending activity. Here, we directly address this question by utilizing vesicles with different degrees of curvature. A tubulation-defective syt mutant was able to promote fusion between highly curved SNARE-bearing liposomes but exhibited a marked loss of activity when the membranes were relatively flat. Moreover, bending of flat membranes by adding an N-BAR domain rescued the function of the tubulation-deficient syt mutant. Hence, syt-mediated membrane bending is a critical step in membrane fusion.

Previous studies relied on reconstituted vesicles that were already highly curved and used mutations in syt that were not selective for membrane-bending activity. Here, we directly address this question by utilizing vesicles with different degrees of curvature. A tubulation-defective syt mutant was able to promote fusion between highly curved SNARE-bearing liposomes but exhibited a marked loss of activity when the membranes were relatively flat. Moreover, bending of flat membranes by adding an N-BAR domain rescued the function of the tubulation-deficient syt mutant. Hence, syt-mediated membrane bending is a critical step in membrane fusion. Chernomordik and coworkers have envisioned membrane fusion and fission as similar processes that pass through analogous intermediate membrane structures but in opposite directions, as dictated by distinct proteins (Kozlov and Chernomordik, 2002Kozlov M.M. Chernomordik L.V. The protein coat in membrane fusion: lessons from fission.Traffic. 2002; 3: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A key step in endocytosis involves localized invagination of the plasma membrane, allowing a nascent vesicle to form. This process is mediated by a set of proteins that are able to deform membranes (Farsad and De Camilli, 2003Farsad K. De Camilli P. Mechanisms of membrane deformation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Interestingly, invagination of the plasma membrane has also been observed during exocytosis in some secretory cells (Monck and Fernandez, 1994Monck J.R. Fernandez J.M. The exocytotic fusion pore and neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 1994; 12: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This remodeling would result in a curved dimple that points toward secretory vesicles, bringing the two membranes into close proximity at a small point of contact to reduce the energy barrier for fusion. Therefore, “dimpling” of the plasma membrane might constitute an essential step in regulated secretion (Monck and Fernandez, 1994Monck J.R. Fernandez J.M. The exocytotic fusion pore and neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 1994; 12: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, proteins that mediate this putative invagination step during exocytosis have yet to be identified. Recent studies have shown that synaptotagmin-I (syt), a Ca2+ sensor that triggers rapid neuronal exocytosis, is able to tubulate membranes in response to Ca2+ (Arac et al., 2006Arac D. Chen X. Khant H.A. Ubach J. Ludtke S.J. Kikkawa M. Johnson A.E. Chiu W. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J.

How synaptotagmin promotes membrane fusion.Science. 2007; 316: 1205-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Hence, syt might operate by buckling the plasma membrane to lower the energy barrier for vesicle fusion. Attempts have been made to correlate syt's ability to tubulate membranes with its ability to promote fusion of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) (Martens et al., 2007Martens S. Kozlov M.M. McMahon H.T. How synaptotagmin promotes membrane fusion.Science. 2007; 316: 1205-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, the SUV membrane is already highly curved; as reported here, using more physiologically relevant lipid mixtures, syt-induced membrane tubules have diameters that are comparable to those of SUVs. These findings indicate that SUV-SUV fusion assays are not dependent on the ability of syt to bend membranes since SUVs are already fully “bent.” In addition, previous work on this problem relied on mutant forms of syt, which, as shown in the present study, also affect the interaction of syt with soluble NSF attachment protein receptors (SNAREs). Because syt functions in part by engaging SNAREs (Chapman, 2008Chapman E.R. How does synaptotagmin trigger neurotransmitter release?.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 615-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), it could not be determined whether the differences in fusion activity observed for these syt mutants were due to changes in membrane-bending or SNARE-binding activity. Here, we directly test the hypothesis that syt must bend membranes in order to promote fusion. This was achieved by analyzing SNARE-mediated fusion of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs, diameter > 1 μm) in parallel with SUVs (diameter ∼65 nm). We found that a syt mutant with compromised membrane-bending activity failed to stimulate fusion when the membrane was relatively flat (i.e., when using GUVs) but functioned effectively when the membrane was already highly curved (i.e., when using SUVs). Addition of the N-BAR domain of endophilin, which plays a critical role in endocytosis—presumably by bending the plasma membrane to facilitate vesicle budding (Farsad et al., 2001Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. Generation of high curvature membranes mediated by direct endophilin bilayer interactions.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) —rescued the function of a membrane-bending-deficient syt mutant during regulated GUV-GUV fusion. These findings indicate that exo- and endocytosis proceed via common intermediate membrane structures. Finally, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of syt—when targeted to either synaptic vesicles or the presynaptic plasma membrane—can rescue rapid exocytosis in syt knockout (KO) neurons, validating the use of this protein fragment in reconstituted fusion assays. To set the stage for assessing the functional significance of syt's membrane-bending activity, we quantitatively analyzed the ability of syt to sense membrane curvature. The cytoplasmic domain of syt consists of tandem C2 domains—C2A and C2B—that bind Ca2+ via two flexible loops that protrude from one end of each domain (Figure 1A) (Fernandez et al., 2001Fernandez I. Arac D. Ubach J. Gerber S.H. Shin O. Gao Y. Anderson R.G. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J.

Structure of the first C2 domain of synaptotagmin I: a novel Ca2+/phospholipid-binding fold.Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Upon binding Ca2+, these loops partially insert into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer (Bai et al., 2004Bai J. Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. PIP2 increases the speed of response of synaptotagmin and steers its membrane-penetration activity toward the plasma membrane.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, Chapman and Davis, 1998Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. Direct interaction of a Ca2+-binding loop of synaptotagmin with lipid bilayers.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13995-14001Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Penetration loops, with substantial molecular volume, should prefer membranes with relatively loose lipid packing, as in the outer leaflet of positively curved bilayers. Indeed, a previous study revealed that C2A-C2B cosediments more avidly with small as opposed to larger liposomes (Martens et al., 2007Martens S. Kozlov M.M. McMahon H.T. How synaptotagmin promotes membrane fusion.Science. 2007; 316: 1205-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Here, we applied three independent assays to gain quantitative insights into the curvature sensing ability of C2A-C2B. We first compared the binding affinities of C2A-C2B with liposomes of different diameters: 105 nm (V105nm), 138 nm (V138nm), 189 nm (V189nm), and 252 nm (V252nm), by assaying C2A-C2B•liposome cosedimentation as a function of lipid concentration (Figure 1B); depletion of protein from the supernatant was used to monitor binding. The resulting titration curves confirmed that C2A-C2B prefers highly curved membranes and resolved an ∼1.9-fold difference in the apparent dissociation constants (KD) between V105nm and V252nm (Figure 1C and Table S1 available online). However, C2A-C2B exhibited similar binding affinities for V252nm and giant unilamellar vesicles (diameters of a few microns), suggesting that C2A-C2B is relatively insensitive to curvature when the vesicle diameter is above 252 nm (Figure S2). A preference for highly curved membranes was exhibited by a range of syt mutants that were analyzed in parallel (Figures S3 and S4; Table S1). We then carried out isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments to determine the thermodynamics of C2A-C2B•membrane interactions. Aliquots of V105nm or V252nm were injected into a sample chamber that contained C2A-C2B; titrations using V252nm exhibited a shallow, right-shifted binding isotherm (Figures 1D and 1E), confirming the idea that syt preferentially binds to highly curved membranes. The isotherm for Ca2+•C2A-C2B•V105nm complex formation exhibited two phases, which are likely due to a binding step followed by lipid rearrangements. This notion is supported by the distinct broadening of peaks in the exothermic phase compared to the earlier endothermic phase, indicating slow lipid rearrangements (Heimburg and Biltonen, 1994Heimburg T. Biltonen R.L. Thermotropic behavior of dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol and its interaction with cytochrome c.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9477-9488Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We fitted the biphasic binding isotherm using a two-site model (Table S2). Here, we only discuss the first site, which is likely to correspond to the lipid-binding step. The stoichiometry (N) was determined to be 81 ± 4. Given that liposomes contained 25% phosphatidylserine (PS) and C2A-C2B only inserts into one leaflet, we estimate that each C2A-C2B binds ∼10 PS molecules. The experiments described thus far were carried out under equilibrium conditions. However, syt might drive slow yet dramatic shape changes in membranes (shown later in Figures 2 and S5–S7), which would affect measurements of the apparent binding strength. To test this, we utilized a stopped-flow rapid mixing approach to examine C2A-C2B•liposome binding at the initial instant of assembly. Reactions were monitored via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the native aromatic residues in C2A-C2B and dansyl-PE in the membranes of vesicles with different diameters (Figure 1F). Rapid mixing of C2A-C2B with liposomes resulted in a rapid increase in fluorescence (Figure 1G), and these data were used to determine kinetic parameters, as summarized in Table S3. These measurements revealed that a reduction in vesicle diameter—from 252 nm to 105 nm—enhances the affinity of the C2A-C2B•membrane interaction 9.3-fold; this is a more dramatic increase than the 1.9-fold difference resolved in the cosedimentation assays (Figure 1C). The fold enhancement in KD as a function of liposome diameter is plotted in Figure 1I. Clearly, kinetic and steady-state measurements of the curvature dependence of syt•membrane interactions differ. These differences are likely to be the result of “work” that syt carries out to bend membranes after the initial binding step. We explored the ability of syt to induce membrane curvature using liposomes made from Folch fraction I brain lipid extract; structures were visualized via negative stain electron microscopy. In the presence of Ca2+, C2A-C2B converted Folch liposomes into long thin lipid tubules (Figures 2A and M3). Tubulation was not observed in the absence of Ca2+ (Figure 2B) or in the absence of protein (Figures 2K and 2L), consistent with previous studies (Arac et al., 2006Arac D. Chen X. Khant H.A. Ubach J. Ludtke S.J. Kikkawa M. Johnson A.E. Chiu W. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Close membrane-membrane proximity induced by Ca(2+)-dependent multivalent binding of synaptotagmin-1 to phospholipids.Nat. Struct. Mol.

How synaptotagmin promotes membrane fusion.Science. 2007; 316: 1205-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to Martens et al., 2007Martens S. Kozlov M.M. McMahon H.T. How synaptotagmin promotes membrane fusion.Science. 2007; 316: 1205-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, membrane tubulation activity did not require the tethering of C2A with C2B, as C2A + C2B also drove tubulation (Figures 2C and M2), albeit to a lesser degree than the intact cytoplasmic domain of syt (C2A-C2B). A striking result was obtained when we tested each isolated C2 domain; the C2B domain tubulated membranes as well as C2A-C2B (Figures 2D and 2N) whereas C2A failed to tubulate membranes (Figure 2E). Even C2A-C2A, in which two C2A domains are tethered together, failed to tubulate membranes (Figure 2F). In contrast, C2B-C2B caused fragmentation of the lipid membranes (Figures 2G and M4), indicative of stronger tubulation activity. Together, these experiments demonstrate that the C2B domain of syt is both necessary and sufficient to drive tubulation. The fact that isolated C2A avidly penetrates bilayers (Chapman and Davis, 1998Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. Direct interaction of a Ca2+-binding loop of synaptotagmin with lipid bilayers.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13995-14001Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, Davis et al., 1999Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R. Kinetics of synaptotagmin responses to Ca2+ and assembly with the core SNARE complex onto membranes.Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) yet fails to drive tubulation indicates that penetration is not sufficient for membrane bending. Having established that C2B is the membrane-bending domain of syt, we next determined the tubulation activity of C2A-C2BCLM, in which the C2B domain does not bind membranes due to neutralization of its Ca2+ ligands (CLM; Ca2+ ligand mutations) (Bai et al., 2002Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. C2A activates a cryptic Ca(2+)-triggered membrane penetration activity within the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This mutant exhibited only trace levels of membrane-tubulation activity (Figures 2H and 2N). Surprisingly, C2ACLM-C2B, which carries analogous Ca2+ ligand mutations only within C2A, also exhibited a large defect in membrane tubulation (Figures 2I and 2N). This indicates that in the context of C2A-C2B, a “dead” C2A domain can inhibit the membrane-bending activity of an adjacent C2B domain. Because nonpolar side chains in the Ca2+-binding loops of syt insert into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer, increasing the hydrophobic volume of these residues should strengthen C2A-C2B•bilayer interactions, which in turn should translate to greater binding energy for deforming membranes. We therefore tested the tubulation activity of C2A3W-C2B3W, in which six nonpolar residues within the membrane-penetration loops were replaced with tryptophans (Trp). This mutant caused the formation of short membrane tubules and tiny vesicles (Figures 2J and M4), suggesting enhanced membrane-bending activity. At relatively low concentrations (1 μM), C2A3W-C2B3W induced the formation of long tubules from Folch liposomes (Figure S6). The tubulation assay described above utilized liposomes made from Folch lipid extract, which is commonly used to study membrane-bending activity. However, this lipid mixture contains much higher levels of PS (∼50%) than occur in cells (7.5%–15%) (Steenbergen et al., 2006Steenbergen R. Nanowski T.S. Nelson R. Young S.G. Vance J.E. Phospholipid homeostasis in phosphatidylserine synthase-2-deficient mice.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); such high levels of PS are likely to exaggerate the membrane-bending activity of syt by enhancing the affinity of Ca2+•syt•membrane complexes. To determine whether syt can tubulate more physiologically relevant membranes, we incubated syt fragments with liposomes containing 15% PS + 30% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) + 55% phosphatidylcholine (PC), i.e., the lipid mix that is used in the reconstituted fusion assays detailed further below, and which contains all of the major phospholipids found in cells in proper ratios. In the presence of Ca2+, C2A-C2B and isolated C2B were both able to tubulate membranes (Figures S7A and S7C), although to a lesser extent than was observed using Folch liposomes (Figure 2). C2A failed to induce any detectable tubulation (Figure S7B), as observed with Folch liposomes (Figure 2E). C2A3W-C2B3W induced dramatic tubulation (Figure S7D). For membranes that harbored 15% PS, C2A-C2B induced the formation of tubules that were 54 ± 20 nm in diameter (Figure S7A), which is markedly greater than what we observed using Folch liposomes that contain ∼50% PS (∼16 nm, Figure 2B; an inverse relationship between fraction of PS and tubule diameter is shown in Figure S8). Thus, the diameter of C2A-C2B-induced membrane tubules (54 ± 20 nm) is comparable to the diameter of the SUVs (65 ± 19 nm) used in standard reconstituted fusion assays. These results indicate that C2A-C2B is unlikely to further bend membranes during reconstituted SUV-SUV fusion (Martens et al., 2007Martens S. Kozlov M.M. McMahon H.T. How synaptotagmin promotes membrane fusion.Science. 2007; 316: 1205-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and the function of the membrane-bending activity of syt has yet to be directly determined. The membrane tubulation activities of a handful of mutant syts were previously reported to correlate with their abilities to stimulate fusion of SNARE-bearing SUVs (Martens et al., 2007Martens S. Kozlov M.M. McMahon H.T. How synaptotagmin promotes membrane fusion.Science. 2007; 316: 1205-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar); e.g., C2A2W-C2B2W, a Trp mutant with enhanced tubulation activity exhibited a greater ability to stimulate fusion. An analogous alanine (Ala) mutant, C2A2A-C2B2A, which fails to tubulate membranes, was defective in the in vitro fusion assay. These correlations led to the suggestion that membrane bending is essential for syt function. However, such correlations do not hold for other mutants, e.g., C2A-C2BCLM does not tubulate membranes to any significant degree but stimulates fusion almost as well as wild-type (WT) C2A-C2B (Bhalla et al., 2005Bhalla A. Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Synaptotagmin isoforms couple distinct ranges of Ca2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ concentration to SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4755-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Stein et al., 2007Stein A. Radhakrishnan A. Riedel D. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Synaptotagmin activates membrane fusion through a Ca2+-dependent trans interaction with phospholipids.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 904-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, although the membrane-bending activity of C2B is similar to that of C2A-C2B (Figure 3D compared to Figure 3A), the ability of isolated C2B to stimulate fusion is much lower (Gaffaney et al., 2008Gaffaney J.D. Dunning F.M. Wang Z. Hui E. Chapman E.R. Synaptotagmin C2B domain regulates Ca2+-triggered fusion in vitro: Critical residues revealed by scanning alanine mutagenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31763-31775Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Syt must engage both membranes and t-SNAREs to regulate SNARE-catalyzed fusion (Chapman, 2008Chapman E.R. How does synaptotagmin trigger neurotransmitter release?.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 615-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), yet the t-SNARE-binding activities of the syt tubulation mutants have not been compared in a systematic way; it is possible that the differential activities of these mutants in the SUV-SUV fusion assay are due to changes in their abilities to engage t-SNAREs. We therefore compared the t-SNARE-binding activities of the aforementioned syt mutants. Immunoprecipitation showed that all mutants tested exhibited significantly altered t-SNARE-binding activity (Figures 3A and 3B). Two Trp mutants, C2A2W-C2B2W and C2A3W-C2B3W, exhibited enhanced t-SNARE-binding activity, whereas all of the other mutants tested showed reductions in binding. In contrast to our findings, another group did not detect significant differences in SNARE-binding activity of the Trp and Ala mutant forms of syt (Lynch et al., 2008Lynch K.L. Gerona R.R. Kielar D.M. Martens S. McMahon H.T. Martin T.F. Synaptotagmin-1 utilizes membrane bending and SNARE binding to drive fusion pore expansion.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 5093-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In order to resolve this issue, we carried out coflotation assays as an independent approach to compare the t-SNARE binding of the syt mutants (Figure 3C). The extent of t-SNARE binding was markedly enhanced for the two Trp mutants and was clearly reduced for the Ala mutant (Figure 3D). These experiments demonstrate that the Trp and Ala mutations affect not only the membrane-tubulation activity of syt but also interactions with t-SNAREs. Hence, it remained unclear whether syt's ability to bend membranes has any functional role during fusion. To directly assess the function of the membrane-bending activity of syt during membrane fusion, we utilized two sets of SNARE-bearing vesicles with distinct intrinsic membrane curvatures: the commonly used SUVs (Chicka et al., 2008Chicka M.C. Hui E. Liu H. Chapman E.R. Synaptotagmin arrests the SNARE complex before triggering fast, efficient membrane fusion in response to Ca(2+).Nat. Struct. Mol.

Fusion between SNARE-bearing vesicles was monitored using FRET (Tucker et al., 2004Tucker W.C. Weber T. Chapman E.R. Reconstitution of Ca2+-regulated membrane fusion by synaptotagmin and SNAREs.Science. 2004; 304: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, Weber et al., 1998Weber T. Zemelman B.V.

SNAREpins: minimal machinery for membrane fusion.Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). The rationale was as follows: mutants that are tubulation deficient but are still able to engage t-SNAREs should be able to stimulate SUV-SUV fusion but should exhibit loss of function in the GUV-GUV fusion assay. By contrast, syt mutants that efficiently bend membranes should be relatively insensitive to membrane curvature. We selected WT, a gain-of-function mutant (C2A3W-C2B3W), a loss-of-function mutant (C2A-C2BCLM), and isolated C2B for these experiments. All of these syt proteins retain some degree of t-SNARE-binding activity (Figure 3A) but have distinct membrane-bending abilities (Figure 2). To measure the effect of membrane curvature on syt-stimulated SNARE-mediated fusion, syt proteins were added to assays containing either SNARE-bearing SUVs or GUVs. For GUV-GUV fusion, C2A-C2BCLM could only stimulate fusion to 19% of the levels of WT (Figure 4D, left). By contrast, in the SUV-SUV system, the extent of C2A-C2BCLM-stimulated fusion reached 70% of the WT level (Figure 4D, right) (Bhalla et al., 2005Bhalla A. Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Synaptotagmin isoforms couple distinct ranges of Ca2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ concentration to SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4755-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, mutations that disrupt the ability of the C2B domain to sense Ca2+ significantly decrease syt's ability to stimulate fusion of vesicles with a low degree of membrane curvature. These findings explain why Ca2+-ligand mutations in C2B completely disrupt the function of syt in neurons (Mackler et al., 2002Mackler J.M. Drummond J.A. Loewen C.A. Robinson I.M. Reist N.E.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8542-8550Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) but have little effect on syt-regulated fusion in in vitro fusion assays that utilize highly curved SUVs (Bhalla et al., 2005Bhalla A. Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Synaptotagmin isoforms couple distinct ranges of Ca2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ concentration to SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4755-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Stein et al., 2007Stein A. Radhakrishnan A. Riedel D. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Synaptotagmin activates membrane fusion through a Ca2+-dependent trans interaction with phospholipids.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 904-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). By mimicking the low curvature of the plasma membrane through the use of GUVs, a greater loss of function can be detected for C2A-C2BCLM, more closely matching the loss-of-function synaptic transmission phenotype. Notably, the functional deficiency exhibited by C2A-C2BCLM was insensitive to changes in membrane fluidity and rigidity (Figure S11). Isolated C2B possesses similar membrane-bending activity but lower t-SNARE-binding activity as compared to C2A-C2B (Figures 2D, 2N, 3A, and 3B). As expected, isolated C2B exhibited a reduced ability to stimulate SUV-SUV fusion compared to C2A-C2B, in accord with a previous report (Gaffaney et al., 2008Gaffaney J.D. Dunning F.M. Wang Z. Hui E. Chapman E.R. Synaptotagmin C2B domain regulates Ca2+-triggered fusion in vitro: Critical residues revealed by scanning alanine mutagenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31763-31775Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This loss of function is most likely due to compromised t-SNARE-binding activity given that the ability of C2B to promote membrane fusion is insensitive to membrane curvature: C2B is equally efficient in GUV-GUV and SUV-SUV fusion assays (55% ± 13% versus 65% ± 9%, p > 0.05). C2A3W-C2B3W is endowed with enhanced membrane-bending and t-SNARE-binding activity (Figures 2J, 2N, and 3A–3D). As expected, this mutant was even more effective than WT C2A-C2B in both SUV-SUV and GUV-GUV fusion assays (132% ± 10% and 151% ± 11%, respectively). The enhancement in activity of the Trp mutant was more prominent in the GUV-GUV fusion assay, presumably due to stronger membrane-bending activity. We next sought to determine which membrane—target (t) or vesicle (v)—must be bent in order for syt to regulate membrane fusion. This was accomplished using asymmetric systems composed of either t-GUV + v-SUV or t-SUV + v-GUV vesicles (Figure S12). Whereas decreases in curvature of either the donor or acceptor membrane resulted in lower extents of fusion, a more significant loss in C2A-C2BCLM-stimulated fusion relative to WT C2A-C2B occurred using the t-GUV/v-SUV system. These data suggest that the curvature of the t-SNARE membrane has a greater effect on syt function and support the idea that syt regulates fusion by doing work on the plasma membrane (Bai et al., 2004Bai J.

https://openalex.org/W1989626257,"Background Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are critical in regulating many aspects of vertebrate embryo development, and for the maintenance of homeostatic equilibrium in adult tissues. The interactions between epithelium and mesenchyme are believed to be mediated by paracrine signals such as cytokines and extracellular matrix components secreted from fibroblasts that affect adjacent epithelia. In this study, we sought to identify the repertoire of microRNAs (miRNAs) in normal lung human fibroblasts and their potential regulation by the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and TGF-β. Methodology/Principal Findings MiR-155 was significantly induced by inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β while it was down-regulated by TGF-β. Ectopic expression of miR-155 in human fibroblasts induced modulation of a large set of genes related to “cell to cell signalling”, “cell morphology” and “cellular movement”. This was consistent with an induction of caspase-3 activity and with an increase in cell migration in fibroblasts tranfected with miR-155. Using different miRNA bioinformatic target prediction tools, we found a specific enrichment for miR-155 predicted targets among the population of down-regulated transcripts. Among fibroblast-selective targets, one interesting hit was keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, FGF-7), a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, which owns two potential binding sites for miR-155 in its 3′-UTR. Luciferase assays experimentally validated that miR-155 can efficiently target KGF 3′-UTR. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that only one out of the 2 potential sites was truly functional. Functional in vitro assays experimentally validated that miR-155 can efficiently target KGF 3′-UTR. Furthermore, in vivo experiments using a mouse model of lung fibrosis showed that miR-155 expression level was correlated with the degree of lung fibrosis. Conclusions/Significance Our results strongly suggest a physiological function of miR-155 in lung fibroblasts. Altogether, this study implicates this miRNA in the regulation by mesenchymal cells of surrounding lung epithelium, making it a potential key player during tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W2161924689,"Norovirus, the most commonly identified cause of both sporadic cases and outbreaks of infectious diarrhoea in developed countries, exhibits a complex epidemiology and has a strong wintertime seasonality. Viral populations are dynamic and evolve under positive selection pressure. Methods Time series-adapted Poisson regression models were fitted to daily counts of laboratory reports of norovirus in England and Wales from 1993 to 2006. Findings Inverse linear associations with daily temperature over the previous seven weeks (rate ratio (RR) = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.86 for every 1°C increase) and relative humidity over the previous five weeks (RR = 0.980; 95% CI: 0.973 to 0.987 for every 1% increase) were found, with temperature having a greater overall effect. The emergence of new norovirus variants (RR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.22) and low population immunity were also associated with heightened norovirus activity. Temperature and humidity, which may be localised, had highly consistent effects in each region of England and Wales. Conclusions These results point to a complex interplay between host, viral and climatic factors driving norovirus epidemic patterns. Increases in norovirus are associated with cold, dry temperature, low population immunity and the emergence of novel genogroup 2 type 4 antigenic variants."
https://openalex.org/W2157647701,"Several types of terminally differentiated somatic cells can be reprogrammed into a pluripotent state by ectopic expression of Klf4, Oct3/4, Sox2, and c-Myc. Such induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have great potential to serve as an autologous source of cells for tissue repair. In the process of developing iPS-cell-based therapies, the major goal is to determine whether differentiated cells derived from iPS cells, such as cardiomyocytes (CMs), have the same functional properties as their physiological in vivo counterparts. Therefore, we differentiated murine iPS cells to CMs in vitro and characterized them by RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and electrophysiology. As key markers of cardiac lineages, transcripts for Nkx2.5, alphaMHC, Mlc2v, and cTnT could be identified. Immunocytochemical stainings revealed the presence of organized sarcomeric actinin but the absence of mature atrial natriuretic factor. We examined characteristics and developmental changes of action potentials, as well as functional hormonal regulation and sensitivity to channel blockers. In addition, we determined expression patterns and functionality of cardiac-specific voltage-gated Na+, Ca2+, and K+ channels at early and late differentiation stages and compared them with CMs derived from murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as well as with fetal CMs. We conclude that iPS cells give rise to functional CMs in vitro, with established hormonal regulation pathways and functionally expressed cardiac ion channels; CMs generated from iPS cells have a ventricular phenotype; and cardiac development of iPS cells is delayed compared with maturation of native fetal CMs and of ESC-derived CMs. This difference may reflect the incomplete reprogramming of iPS cells and should be critically considered in further studies to clarify the suitability of the iPS model for regenerative medicine of heart disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1964397781,"The type VI secretion system (T6SS) has emerged as a protein secretion system important to several gram-negative bacterial species. One of the common components of the system is Hcp, initially described as a hemolysin co-regulated protein in a serotype O17 strain of Vibrio cholerae. Homologs to V. cholerae hcp genes have been found in all characterized type VI secretion systems and they are present also in the serotype O1 strains of V. cholerae that are the cause of cholera diseases but seemed to have non-functional T6SS.The serotype O1 V. cholerae strain A1552 was shown to express detectable levels of Hcp as determined by immunoblot analyses using polyclonal anti-Hcp antiserum. We found that the expression of Hcp was growth phase dependent. The levels of Hcp in quorum sensing deficient mutants of V. cholerae were compared with the levels in wild type V. cholerae O1 strain A1552. The expression of Hcp was positively and negatively regulated by the quorum sensing regulators HapR and LuxO, respectively. In addition, we observed that expression of Hcp was dependent on the cAMP-CRP global transcriptional regulatory complex and required the RpoN sigma factor.Our results show that serotype O1 strains of V. cholerae do express Hcp which is regarded as one of the important T6SS components and is one of the secreted substrates in non-O1 non-O139 V. cholerae isolates. We found that expression of Hcp was strictly regulated by the quorum sensing system in the V. cholerae O1 strain. In addition, the expression of Hcp required the alternative sigma factor RpoN and the cAMP-CRP global regulatory complex. Interestingly, the environmental isolates of V. cholerae O1 strains that showed higher levels of the HapR quorum sensing regulator in comparison with our laboratory standard serotype O1 strain A1552 where also expressing higher levels of Hcp."
https://openalex.org/W2034351576,"The distinct lack of cell lines derived from the adult brain is evident. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) triggers neurogenesis in primary culture from adult mouse hypothalamus, as detected by bromodeoxyuridine and Ki67 immunostaining. Using SV-40 T-antigen, we immortalized dividing neurons and generated clonal cell lines expressing neuropeptides and receptors involved in neuroendocrine function. We hypothesized that proglucagon-derived peptides may be the mechanistic downstream effectors of CNTF due to documented neuroprotective and proliferative effects. Indeed, proglucagon gene expression was induced by CNTF, and exposure of primary cells to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1) agonist, exendin-4, induced cell proliferation. Intracerebroventricular injection of CNTF into adult mice caused increased expression of proglucagon peptide in the hypothalamus. Using a specific GLP-1-receptor antagonist, we found that neurogenesis was significantly attenuated and primary culture from GLP-1-receptor-knockout mice lacked CNTF-mediated neuronal proliferation, thus linking the induction of neurogenesis in the hypothalamus to GLP-1-receptor signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2056495061,"There are no cures or efficacious treatments for severe motor neuron diseases. It is extremely difficult to obtain naïve spinal motor neurons (sMNs) from human tissues for research due to both technical and ethical reasons. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are alternative sources. Several methods for MN differentiation have been reported. However, efficient production of naïve sMNs and culture cost were not taken into consideration in most of the methods.We aimed to establish protocols for efficient production and enrichment of sMNs derived from pluripotent stem cells. Nestin+ neural stem cell (NSC) clusters were induced by Noggin or a small molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling. After dissociation of NSC clusters, neurospheres were formed in a floating culture containing FGF2. The number of NSCs in neurospheres could be expanded more than 30-fold via several passages. More than 33% of HB9+ sMN progenitor cells were observed after differentiation of dissociated neurospheres by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and a Shh agonist for another week on monolayer culture. HB9+ sMN progenitor cells were enriched by gradient centrifugation up to 80% purity. These HB9+ cells differentiated into electrophysiologically functional cells and formed synapses with myotubes during a few weeks after ATRA/SAG treatment.The series of procedures we established here, namely neural induction, NSC expansion, sMN differentiation and sMN purification, can provide large quantities of naïve sMNs derived from human and monkey pluripotent stem cells. Using small molecule reagents, reduction of culture cost could be achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2080162671,"Actin filament assembly in nonmuscle cells is regulated by the actin polymerization machinery, including the Arp2/3 complex and formins.

Here, we show that Fhod3, a myocardial formin that localizes to thin actin filaments in a striated pattern, regulates sarcomere organization in cardiomyocytes. RNA interference-mediated depletion of Fhod3 results in a marked reduction in filamentous actin and disruption of the sarcomeric structure.

These findings suggest that actin dynamics regulated by Fhod3 are critical for sarcomere organization in striated muscle cells. In striated muscle, thin actin filaments and thick filaments of myosin are highly organized to form myofibrils (1Clark K.A. McElhinny A.S. Beckerle M.C. Gregorio C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 637-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). During myofibrillogenesis, actin cytoskeleton undergoes dynamic remodeling to produce uniform lengths of straight filaments packaged in the sarcomere, a contractile unit of myofibrils (2Gregorio C.C. Antin P.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 3Sanger J.W. Kang S. Siebrands C.C. Freeman N. Du A. Wang J. Stout A.L. Sanger J.M.

Biol. 2008; 19: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In nascent sarcomeres, a filamentous actin-containing structure, referred to as the Z-body or I-Z-I structure, emerges as a precursor of the Z-line that anchors actin filaments. Subsequent alignment of the precursors leads to formation of a striated pattern of the Z-line, and myosin filaments are incorporated between Z-lines. Finally, the M-line that serves as an anchoring site for myosin filaments becomes visible; the appearance is accompanied by alignment of the unanchored end of actin filaments (5Markwald R.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1973; 5: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, the mature distribution pattern of actin filaments is constructed at the final step in myofibril assembly, indicating that actin filaments continue to develop throughout myofibrillogenesis. However, the regulation of actin dynamics in this process has remained poorly understood. In nonmuscle cells, organization of actin cytoskeleton is achieved by two major actin nucleating-polymerizing systems, formins and the Arp2/3 complex, with the former producing long straight actin filaments and the latter producing branched actin network (6Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2007; 36: 451-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 7Chhabra E.S. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1110-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Because an unbranched straight actin filament is the major form in striated muscle cells, it is possible that a formin family protein serves as the key regulator of actin dynamics in myofibrils. Formins are characterized by the presence of two conserved regions, the formin homology 1 and 2 domains (FH1 and FH2 domains, respectively) 2The abbreviations used are: FH1 and FH2formin homology 1 and 2, respectivelyDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininsiRNAsmall interfering RNA.

The FH2 domain associates with the barbed end of an actin filament and promotes actin nucleation and polymerization. The FH2 domain continues to associate with the barbed end during polymerization; this processive association protects the growing barbed end from capping proteins that inhibit actin elongation. The FH1 domain, located N-terminally to the FH2 domain, accelerates the FH2-mediated actin elongation via recruiting profilin complexed with an actin monomer. Through cooperation of the FH1 and FH2 domains, formins produce long straight actin filaments even in the presence of capping proteins. Here, we focused on the role of the mammalian formin Fhod3 (previously designated as Fhos2L), which is expressed predominantly in the heart (10Kanaya H. Takeya R. Takeuchi K. Watanabe N. Jing N.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4567-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding mouse Fhod3-ΔN (amino acids 931–1578) was constructed by PCR using the cDNA encoding mouse Fhod3. The cDNA encoding mDia1-FH1FH2 (amino acids 549–1175) was cloned by PCR using the expressed sequence tag clone MGC:86169 as a template. The cDNA for human profilin IIa was cloned by PCR using human brain cDNAs from the Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panel (BD Biosciences) as a template. Mutations leading to the indicated amino acid substitutions were introduced by PCR-mediated sited-directed mutagenesis. The DNA fragments were ligated to pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) or pEF-BOS for expression in HeLa cells as an N-terminally green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged protein or for expression in HEK-293F cells as an N-terminally FLAG-tagged protein, respectively. For expression of Fhod3 and their mutants as HA-tagged proteins in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the adenoviruses encoding HA-tagged mouse Fhod3 and their mutants were constructed by the Adeno-XTM Expression System (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were sequenced for confirmation of their identities. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for Fhod3 (anti-Fhod3-(650–802), anti-Fhod3-(873–974), and anti-Fhod3-(C-20)) were prepared as described previously (10Kanaya H. Takeya R. Takeuchi K. Watanabe N. Jing N. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies were purchased from commercial sources as indicated: clone EA-53 against α-actinin (Sigma); clone 3-48 against cardiac myosin heavy chain (Abcam); clone Alpha-Sr-1 against sarcomeric actin (Dako); clone 16B12 against HA (Covance). Goat polyclonal antibodies against myomesin-1 (C-16) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Primary cultures of cardiac myocytes were prepared from ventricles of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats according to the method of Simpson (12Simpson P. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (13Suematsu N. Tsutsui H. Wen J. Kang D. Ikeuchi M. Ide T. Hayashidani S. Shiomi T. Kubota T. Hamasaki N. Takeshita A. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1418-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were isolated from 1-day-old postnatal Sprague-Dawley rats, trisected, and then incubated with trypsin (50 μg/ml, Worthington TRLS) in Hanks' balanced saline solution buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, and 5.6 mm glucose) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, they were digested with collagenase type II (300 units/ml, Worthington CLS2) on a shaking instrument (140 rpm) for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were preplated for 70 min into 100-mm culture dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS to reduce the number of nonmyocytes. Cells that were not attached to the dishes were plated and cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS. The purity of myocytes in the culture was >80%, which was estimated by immunofluorescent staining with an anti-sarcomeric actin antibody. Transfection of cardiomyocytes with the adenovirus encoding Fhod3 was performed 24 h after plating. After incubation with the adenovirus for 60 min, cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS for another 48 h and used for the experiments. In the case of sequential transfection with the adenovirus and siRNA, cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) immediately after incubation with the adenovirus for 60 min. After the sequential transfection, the cells were cultured for 48 h and used for the experiments. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine and cultured for 3 h. After the addition of DMEM containing 10% FCS, cells were cultured for another 13 h. Cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 10 min at −20 °C and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 60 min. In the case of phalloidin staining, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 4 min, and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 60 min. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed using anti-Fhod3, anti-α-actinin, anti-myomesin, and anti-sarcomeric actin antibodies as primary antibodies, and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat antibodies (Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. For F-actin staining, Texas Red-X phalloidin (Invitrogen) was used. Images were taken with a microscope (Axiovert 200; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) coupled to a camera (Axiocam HRm; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging), with the exception of those shown in Fig. 1, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S1, A and B, which were acquired and processed by deconvolution using a DeltaVision RT imaging system (Applied Precision). Double-stranded siRNAs targeting Fhod3 were synthesized as a 25-nucleotide modified synthetic RNA (StealthTM RNAi; Invitrogen). The sequences were as follows: Fhod3-1(3212) (sense), 5′-CGGUAAUUUAUUGGCUUCUCCUGUG-3′; Fhod3-1(3212) (antisense), 5′-CACAGGAGAAGCCAAUAAAUUACCG-3′; Fhod3-2(3429) (sense), 5′-GAGCACCUGUUUGAGUCCAAGUCUA-3′; Fhod3-2(3429) (antisense), 5′-UAGACUUGGACUCAAACAGGUGCUC-3′; Fhod3-3(U1) (sense), 5′-CGCAUUGACAUGGAUCUCCAGAAAU-3′; Fhod3-3(U1) (antisense), 5′-AUUUCUGGAGAUCCAUGUCAAUGCG-3′; Fhod3-4(U3) (sense), 5′-UCUCCAGAAAUCUCCUGCAUGUAUU-3′; and Fhod3-4(U3) (antisense), 5′-AAUACAUGCAGGAGAUUUCUGGAGA-3′. Fhod3-1 and Fhod3-2 were designed for a coding region, and Fhod3-3 and Fhod3-4 were for a 3′-untranslated region of Fhod3. As a negative control for Fhod3 siRNAs, Low GC Duplex of StealthTM RNAi negative control duplexes (Invitrogen) were used. Transfection of cardiomyocytes with siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection, cells were cultured for 48 h and used for the experiments. Cells were broken with a lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were applied to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was probed with the anti-Fhod3 polyclonal antibodies or anti-HA monoclonal antibody. For preparation of Fhod3 and mDia1 proteins, FreeStyle HEK-293F cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with an expression vector encoding the respective cDNAs. The transfected cells were broken with the lysis buffer, and the lysate was precipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (M2)-conjugated agarose (Sigma). Proteins eluted with FLAG peptide (200 μg/ml) in X buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9) were used for an actin polymerization assay as described below. Human profilin IIa were expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), and cleaved with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Spectrin-actin seeds were isolated from erythrocyte ghosts by the method of Lin and Lin (14Lin D.C. Lin S. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 103: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Pyrene-actin polymerization assays were performed in X buffer as described previously (15Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33175-33180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, G-actin (10% pyrene-labeled) was prepared in G buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C for the removal of residual F-actin. Polymerization reactions were performed in 100 μl of X buffer containing 2 μm actin (10% pyrene-labeled) or 0.5 μm actin (20% pyrene-labeled), and 25 nm formin proteins. All reaction components except the actin were mixed in X buffer, and the reaction was started by the addition of actin. Fluorescence changes (excitation wavelength of 365 nm; emission wavelength of 430 nm) were measured using the microplate reader FlexStation3 (Molecular Devices). We have shown previously that, in the fetal rat heart, Fhod3 distributes in a striated pattern (10Kanaya H. Takeya R. Takeuchi K. Watanabe N. Jing N. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To investigate the detailed localization of Fhod3 with respect to other sarcomeric proteins, we double stained neonatal rat cardiomyocytes for Fhod3 and the Z-line marker α-actinin. Immunofluorescence staining with the anti-Fhod3-(650–802) antibodies demonstrated that cardiac muscle Fhod3 localizes to a pair of narrow bands between the α-actinin-containing Z-lines (Fig. 1B). This periodic localization was confirmed with another two anti-Fhod3 polyclonal antibodies: the anti-Fhod3-(C-20) and anti-Fhod3-(873–974) (supplemental Fig. S1A). Exogenously expressed Fhod3 also localized as paired narrow bands between the Z-lines (supplemental Fig. S1B). We next investigated the localization of Fhod3 with respect to the M-line, located at the center of a sarcomere. Double staining for Fhod3 and the sarcomeric M-line protein myomesin (16Grove B.K. Kurer V. Lehner C. Doetschman T.C. Perriard J.C. Eppenberger H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) revealed that the M-line was localized in a narrower gap of Fhod3 bands (Fig. 1C). Double staining of F-actin and Fhod3 revealed that endogenous Fhod3 (Fig. 1D) as well as exogenous Fhod3 (supplemental Fig. S1C) localizes at both edges of the phalloidin-stained thin filaments. Thus, Fhod3 in cardiac myocytes is located on thin actin filaments, particularly accumulated near the middle of the sarcomere (Fig. 1A). In more than half of cells overexpressing Fhod3, striated myofibrils did not extend throughout the cell but underwent a structural transition to actin filament bundles that lacked normal striated pattern of α-actinin, although central areas of the cell showed well developed myofibril organization (supplemental Fig. S2A). These characteristic bundles are also observed in cells overexpressing Fhod3S, a short splice variant expressed predominantly in the kidney and brain (10Kanaya H. Takeya R. Takeuchi K. Watanabe N. Jing N. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2, B and C), supporting the idea that Fhod3 plays a role in sarcomere organization. To investigate the role of Fhod3 in sarcomeric organization, we knocked down Fhod3 in rat cardiomyocytes using four distinct double-stranded siRNAs (siRNAs 1–4). Transfection of cardiomyocytes with these siRNAs led to a significant decrease in Fhod3 at the protein level (Fig. 2, A and B). The effect of these siRNAs appeared to be specific to Fhod3 because the amount of myosin heavy chain, a sarcomeric protein, was not affected (Fig. 2B). In siRNA-treated cells, sarcomere organization was disrupted: the Z-band marker α-actinin concentrated in a punctated manner, which is in marked contrast with the striated pattern of α-actinin expression in control cells (Fig. 2, A and C, and supplemental Fig. S3). Depletion of Fhod3 also resulted in drastic decrease of phalloidin staining, indicating that actin filament formation per se is blocked (Fig. 2D). Although control cardiac myocytes had a flattened star-shaped morphology with longitudinal myofibrils along the edge of cells, Fhod3-depleted cardiomyocytes showed a rounded cell shape. Thus, depletion of Fhod3 induced a drastic change of myocardial cytoskeleton. To confirm the involvement of Fhod3 in sarcomere organization, we sequentially transfected the cardiomyocytes with Fhod3 siRNA 3, targeted to a 3′-untranslated region, and with the adenovirus encoding the wild-type Fhod3 protein, which lacks the 3′-untranslated region, and thus mRNA derived from the cDNA was expected to be unaffected by the siRNA. Expression of RNAi-resistant wild-type Fhod3 sufficiently rescued the effect of Fhod3 siRNA on sarcomere organization (Fig. 3, A and B), confirming that Fhod3 is required for sarcomere organization.FIGURE 3Sarcomere disorganization caused by Fhod3 knock down is restored by expression of the wild-type (wt) Fhod3 but not by that of mutant proteins defective in the actin assembly activity. A, cardiomyocytes were sequentially transfected with the adenovirus encoding HA-tagged wild-type or mutant Fhod3 and with Fhod3 siRNA 4 and cultured for 48 h.

Fhod3-ΔN, a truncated fragment expected to function as an active form because of a lack of the intramolecular interaction mediated by the N-terminal region (10Kanaya H. Takeya R. Takeuchi K. Watanabe N. Jing N. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), markedly induced formation of stress fibers in HeLa cells (Fig. 4A). It has been shown that substitution of Ala for Ile1431 or Asp for Lys1601 in the FH2 domain of the yeast formin Bni1p abolishes the actin-nucleating activity (17Xu Y. Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Poy F. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Eck M.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 18Otomo T. Tomchick D.R. Otomo C. Panchal S.C. Machius M. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2005; 433: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The corresponding substitution in the Fhod3 FH2 domain, i.e. I1127A or K1273D, resulted in a loss of stress fiber formation (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating that these substitutions abrogate the actin assembly activity of Fhod3. In contrast to the wild-type Fhod3, Fhod3-(I1127A) or Fhod3-(K1273D) in an RNAi-resistant form failed to rescue the formation of the striated pattern of α-actinin (Fig. 3, A and B), although these mutant proteins were fully expressed in the siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 3C). Similarly, F-actin organization in a striated pattern was not restored by expression of Fhod3-(I1127A) or Fhod3-(K1273D) in cells depleted of endogenous Fhod3 (supplemental Fig. S4). These findings indicate that the Fhod3 FH2-mediated actin assembly is critical for sarcomere organization in myofibrils. Finally, we tested the ability of Fhod3 proteins purified (supplemental Fig. S5) to assemble actin in vitro. As shown in Fig. 5A, Fhod3-ΔN inhibited spontaneous assembly of actin. The inhibition was attenuated by substitution of alanine for Ile1127 in Fhod3. We also investigated the effect of profilin, an actin-monomer-binding protein that accelerates actin elongation from barded ends by delivering actin monomers to the FH1 domain of several formins (19Kovar D.R. Kuhn J.R. Tichy A.L. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 875-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 20Romero S. Le Clainche C. Didry D. Egile C. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 2004; 119: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Even in the presence of profilin, Fhod3 did not accelerate but rather inhibited actin assembly, although mDia1 effectively did (Fig. 5B). To know the mechanism whereby Fhod3 inhibits actin assembly, we monitored seed-dependent actin assembly in the presence of 0.5 μm G-actin (Fig. 5C). Under the conditions, actin elongation is allowed only from the barbed end. The wild-type Fhod3 reduced the elongation rate from barbed ends, although it was marginally affected by Fhod3-(I1127A). Thus, Fhod3 likely associates the barbed end of actin filaments and regulates the elongation of actin filaments. As shown in the present study, Fhod3 in cardiomyocytes localizes to thin actin filaments, particularly to areas near the middle of the sarcomere. Because actin filaments in mature myofibrils direct their pointed ends toward the M-line at the center of the sarcomere, Fhod3 appears to associate with actin filaments near the pointed end (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, it seems likely that Fhod3 functions at the barbed end of actin filaments in a manner similar to that of other formins: the residues Ile1431 and Lys1601 in the FH2 domain of Bni1p are critical for binding to the barbed-end side of an actin molecule (18Otomo T. Tomchick D.R. Otomo C. Panchal S.C. Machius M. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2005; 433: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and conserved in the Fhod3 FH2 domain (10Kanaya H. Takeya R. Takeuchi K. Watanabe N. Jing N. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As expected, Fhod3 regulates the elongation rate from the barbed end (Fig. 5). Thus, Fhod3 likely functions by associating directly with the barbed end of actin filaments. The region where Fhod3 localizes in cells containing the sarcomere formed (i.e. near the center of the sarcomere; between the Z-band and M-line in the sarcomere) appears to be different from the site where Fhod3 has function to form actin filaments. The present study demonstrates that the Fhod3S, a short spliced variant that lacks 151 amino acids in the N-terminal region (10Kanaya H. Takeya R. Takeuchi K. Watanabe N. Jing N. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), is not periodically localized in contrast to Fhod3 (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S4), suggesting that the N-terminal region rather than the FH2 domain is responsible for the localization of Fhod3 near the center of the sarcomere. In Fhod3-depleted cardiomyocytes, Fhod3S fully rescues the periodic accumulation of α-actinin (Fig. 3B). Fhod3S also promotes F-actin formation, but in a much less striated pattern (supplemental Figs. S2C and S4). Thus, the periodic localization of Fhod3 appears to be involved in adequate sarcomere organization. It is also possible that the barbed ends with which Fhod3 associates are close to the central region of the sarcomere. Quantitative estimation of fluorescent-actin subunit exchange in living muscle cells has revealed that actin dynamics predominate at the pointed ends near the center of the sarcomere (21Littlefield R. Almenar-Queralt A. Fowler V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). If short filaments capped at their barbed ends by Fhod3 are incorporated to the pointed end of thin filaments through end-to-end annealing, Fhod3-associated barbed ends might be present near the middle of the sarcomere. In this context, it should be noted that actin filaments nucleated by the yeast formin Cdc12p anneal end-to-end in the presence of tropomyosin, whose vertebrate ortholog is a major component of the thin filaments in myofibrils (22Skau C.T. Neidt E.M. Kovar D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2160-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Future studies are awaited to elucidate the mechanism for localization of Fhod3. The present study shows that Fhod3 plays a crucial role in the sarcomere organization of cardiomyocytes, which requires its actin assembly activity. It is well known that, in mature myofibrils, both pointed and barbed ends of the thin filaments are capped and stabilized: the barbed ends by CapZ and the pointed ends by tropomodulin (1Clark K.A. McElhinny A.S. Beckerle M.C. Gregorio C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 637-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). These two capping proteins have been shown to be essential for proper organization of the sarcomere (23Schafer D.A. Hug C. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 24Gregorio C.C. Weber A. Bondad M. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). On the other hand, actin polymerization per se is indispensable for myofibrillogenesis (25Manasek F.J. Burnside B. Stroman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1972; 69: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For effective addition of actin monomers to both ends during myofibrillogenesis, protection of the ends from capping proteins seems to be required. Because formins and capping proteins compete for the barbed end of actin filaments (26Zigmond S.H. Evangelista M. Boone C. Yang C. Dar A.C. Sicheri F. Forkey J. Pring M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1820-1823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 27Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the cardiac formin Fhod3 may protect the barbed end for actin assembly in sarcomere formation. Surprisingly, Fhod3 does not promote in vitro actin polymerization with purified actin in the presence or absence of profilin and/or preformed actin seeds (Fig. 5). These findings suggest that Fhod3 functions together with factors absent in the in vitro system to regulate organization of actin filaments. In addition to the effects on actin filaments, Fhod3 might also contribute to sarcomere formation through activation of the serum response factor presumably via depletion of the monomeric actin pool (28Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 29Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol.

Fhod3 may regulate actin assembly and turnover in sarcomeres in combination with these pointed-end regulators. The present findings not only give information on a physiological role of Fhod3 in cardiomyocytes but also provide insights into the regulation of actin dynamics during myofibrillogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W1967374496,"Emerging infectious diseases are of great concern for both wildlife and humans. Several highly virulent fungal pathogens have recently been discovered in natural populations, highlighting the need for a better understanding of fungal-vertebrate host-pathogen interactions. Because most fungal pathogens are not fatal in the absence of other predisposing conditions, host-pathogen dynamics for deadly fungal pathogens are of particular interest. The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (hereafter Bd) infects hundreds of species of frogs in the wild. It is found worldwide and is a significant contributor to the current global amphibian decline. However, the mechanism by which Bd causes death in amphibians, and the response of the host to Bd infection, remain largely unknown. Here we use whole-genome microarrays to monitor the transcriptional responses to Bd infection in the model frog species, Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis, which is susceptible to chytridiomycosis. To elucidate the immune response to Bd and evaluate the physiological effects of chytridiomycosis, we measured gene expression changes in several tissues (liver, skin, spleen) following exposure to Bd. We detected a strong transcriptional response for genes involved in physiological processes that can help explain some clinical symptoms of chytridiomycosis at the organismal level. However, we detected surprisingly little evidence of an immune response to Bd exposure, suggesting that this susceptible species may not be mounting efficient innate and adaptive immune responses against Bd. The weak immune response may be partially explained by the thermal conditions of the experiment, which were optimal for Bd growth. However, many immune genes exhibited decreased expression in Bd-exposed frogs compared to control frogs, suggesting a more complex effect of Bd on the immune system than simple temperature-mediated immune suppression. This study generates important baseline data for ongoing efforts to understand differences in response to Bd between susceptible and resistant frog species and the effects of chytridiomycosis in natural populations."
https://openalex.org/W2000755375,"Background Notch receptors are normally cleaved during maturation by a furin-like protease at an extracellular site termed S1, creating a heterodimer of non-covalently associated subunits. The S1 site lies within a key negative regulatory region (NRR) of the receptor, which contains three highly conserved Lin12/Notch repeats and a heterodimerization domain (HD) that interact to prevent premature signaling in the absence of ligands. Because the role of S1 cleavage in Notch signaling remains unresolved, we investigated the effect of S1 cleavage on the structure, surface trafficking and ligand-mediated activation of human Notch1 and Notch2, as well as on ligand-independent activation of Notch1 by mutations found in human leukemia. Principal Findings The X-ray structure of the Notch1 NRR after furin cleavage shows little change when compared with that of an engineered Notch1 NRR lacking the S1-cleavage loop. Likewise, NMR studies of the Notch2 HD domain show that the loop containing the S1 site can be removed or cleaved without causing a substantial change in its structure. However, Notch1 and Notch2 receptors engineered to resist S1 cleavage exhibit unexpected differences in surface delivery and signaling competence: S1-resistant Notch1 receptors exhibit decreased, but detectable, surface expression and ligand-mediated receptor activation, whereas S1-resistant Notch2 receptors are fully competent for cell surface delivery and for activation by ligands. Variable dependence on S1 cleavage also extends to T-ALL-associated NRR mutations, as common class 1 mutations display variable decrements in ligand-independent activation when introduced into furin-resistant receptors, whereas a class 2 mutation exhibits increased signaling activity. Conclusions/Significance S1 cleavage has distinct effects on the surface expression of Notch1 and Notch2, but is not generally required for physiologic or pathophysiologic activation of Notch proteins. These findings are consistent with models for receptor activation in which ligand-binding or T-ALL-associated mutations lead to conformational changes of the NRR that permit metalloprotease cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2164463818,"Chromogranin A (CHGA/Chga), a proprotein, widely distributed in endocrine and neuroendocrine tissues (not expressed in muscle, liver, and adipose tissues), generates at least four bioactive peptides. One of those peptides, pancreastatin (PST), has been reported to interfere with insulin action. We generated a Chga knock-out (KO) mouse by the targeted deletion of the Chga gene in neuroendocrine tissues. KO mice displayed hypertension, higher plasma catecholamine, and adipokine levels and lower IL-6 and lipid levels compared with wild type mice. Liver glycogen content was elevated, but the nitric oxide (NO) level was diminished. Glucose, insulin, and pyruvate tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies established increased insulin sensitivity in liver but decreased glucose disposal in muscle. Despite higher catecholamine and ketone body levels and muscle insulin resistance, KO mice maintained euglycemia due to increased liver insulin sensitivity. Suppressed mRNA abundance of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) in KO mice further support this conclusion. PST administration in KO mice stimulated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and G6Pase mRNA abundance and raised the blood glucose level. In liver cells transfected with G6Pase promoter, PST caused transcriptional activation in a protein kinase C (PKC)- and NO synthase-dependent manner. Thus, PST action may be mediated by suppressing IRS1/2-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-FOXO-1 signaling and insulin-induced maturation of SREBP1c by PKC and a high level of NO. The combined effects of conventional PKC and endothelial NO synthase activation by PST can suppress insulin signaling.

To further delineate the role of PST in metabolism, we tested whether removal of PST, a negative regulator of insulin action, stabilizes glucose levels in knock-out (KO) mice and protects against metabolic disorders. To this end, we characterized more extensively the phenotype of the global Chga KO mouse (12Mahapatra N.R. O'Connor D.T. Vaingankar S.M. Hikim A.P. Mahata M. Ray S. Staite E. Wu H. Gu Y. Dalton N.

Young adult (3 months old) and adult (6 months old) WT (31 ± 1 g) and KO (37 ± 1 g) mice with mixed genetic background (129svJ × C57BL/6) were used in this study. Both WT and KO mice were generated from the original founder carrying mixed genotype (50% 128svJ, 50% C57BL/6) and were maintained by brother/sister mating. Animals were kept in a 12-h dark/light cycle and fed standard chow ad libitum. The Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee approved all procedures. Equal numbers of male and female mice were fasted overnight (12 h) for each experiment except for the clamp study where only male mice were used. Following anesthesia with isoflurane, overnight fasted mice underwent dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning to measure total tissue and fat mass and lean body mass using a PixiMus mouse densitometer (GE Healthcare). Blood glucose was measured using microcuvettes (HemoCue, Lake Forest, CA) and a Glucose 201 analyzer (HemoCue). A mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) was used to determine plasma insulin. C-peptide was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Shibayagi Co. Ltd.). Glucagon was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Wako Chemicals). A radioimmunoassay kit (Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos, CA) was used to measure plasma PST. Plasma triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels were assayed by triacylglycerol and NEFA C test kits, respectively, from Wako Diagnostics (Richmond, VA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used to determine plasma levels of leptin and adiponectin (Millipore) and IL-6 (Pierce). The blood (tail snip) ketone level (mmol/liter) was measured using the Precision Xtra Blood Ketone Monitoring System (Abbott Laboratories) according to manufacturer's instructions. Liver tissue (25–100 mg) was dissolved in hot KOH (30%) before glycogen was precipitated in 3 ml of 95% ethanol (at 4 °C overnight) and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 12 min. The pellet was redissolved in 5 ml of water, and 1 ml was mixed with 3 ml of anthrone reagent (0.2% anthrone (Sigma) in concentrated H2SO4) (14Seifter S. Dayton S. Arch. Biochem. 1950; 25: 191-200PubMed Google Scholar) to determine the concentration at 620 nm by comparison with standard glycogen (Sigma). A nitrate/nitrite colorimetric assay kit (Cayman Chemical Co.) was used to determine liver NO content. Dextrose (2 g/kg intraperitoneally; glucose tolerance test (GTT)), human insulin (0.40 IU/kg intraperitoneally; Novolin, Novo Nordisk Inc.; insulin tolerance test (ITT)), or pyruvate (2 g/kg intraperitoneally; pyruvate tolerance test) were injected into fasting (12 h) mice before determining the tail vein glucose level at 0–150 min following injection. Briefly mice were anesthetized (80 mg/kg ketamine, 0.5 mg/kg acepromazine, and 16 mg/kg xylazine) via intramuscular injection. Two microurethane catheters (0.012-μm inner diameter; Dow Corning Silastic) were inserted in the jugular vein, and the cannulas were externalized to the midscapula region and secured within tubing. After 5 days of recovery, mice were fasted (3 h) and placed in a Lucite restrainer (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA). After 90 min, an equilibrating tracer solution of d-[3-3H]glucose (5 μCi/h; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was infused via the jugular cannula for 90 min. At the end of the equilibration period (t = 0 min; fasted for 6 h), blood was collected (15 μl in duplicate) and deproteinized to assess tracer specific activity and basal hepatic glucose production. In addition, ∼75 μl of whole blood was collected by cutting the tail vein for the measurement of fasting plasma insulin and free fatty acid concentrations. After blood collection, mice were infused with insulin (12.0 milliunits/kg/min; Humulin® R, Eli Lilly and Co.) and d-[3-3H]glucose (5 μCi/h; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blood glucose was assessed every 10 min, and a glucose solution (50% dextrose; Hospira, Inc.) was infused at a variable rate to maintain blood glucose at ∼120 ± 5 mg/dl. The clamp was terminated when steady state conditions were maintained for ≥30 min (∼130 min). At this time, blood was sampled (15 μl in duplicate) 10 min apart to assess glucose disposal rate (GDR) and insulin-stimulated hepatic glucose production and to verify that steady state conditions for specific activity of the tracer were achieved. An additional 75 μl of whole blood was also collected at the end of the clamp to measure plasma insulin and free fatty acids concentrations during the clamp. Mice were infused with collagenase (Blendzyme, Roche Applied Science) through the inferior vena cava, and hepatocytes were isolated by the method of Smedsrød and Pertoft (15Smedsrød B. Pertoft H. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1985; 38: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Percoll-purified hepatocytes were cultured in William's medium E (Invitrogen), 2 mm Glutamax, 10 nm dexamethasone, 5% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics. Dexamethasone was withdrawn 6 h later, and cultures were exposed initially to PST (20 nm) for 20 h and then to glucose-free, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing PST for an additional 4 h. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was then replaced by phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 16 mm lactate, and 4 mm pyruvate with or without insulin (20 nm) and incubated for another 4 h. At the end, glucose levels in the media were assayed by a kit (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), and cellular protein levels were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Adipocytes were isolated from mouse visceral adipose tissue following a procedure described by Karnieli et al. (16Karnieli E. Zarnowski M.J. Hissin P.J. Simpson I.A. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4772-4777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L6 muscle cells were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. A. Klip (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). L6 myoblast cells were grown in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and then switched to 2% fetal bovine serum for differentiation into myotubes. After 8 days in differentiation medium, myotubes were used for glucose uptake studies. Glucose uptake in muscle and adipocytes cells was carried out in HEPES-salt buffer with or without 20 nm insulin treatment for 30 min followed by incubation (6 min) with 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (0.1 mm final concentration). After final incubation, cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, counted for radioactivity, and normalized against protein. A group of eight KO mice were injected with PST (20 μg/g of body weight intraperitoneally twice daily) for 7 days. On the 8th day, WT, KO, and KO + PST mice (n = 4 in each group) were fasted for 12 h and injected either with vehicle or with insulin (0.4 milliunits/g of body weight intraperitoneally). Mice were sacrificed after 20 min of treatment to collect tissues, which were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues from vehicle-treated mice were considered as basal. Frozen tissues were homogenized in liquid nitrogen and lysed in a lysis buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described elsewhere (17Hevener A.L. Olefsky J.M. Reichart D. Nguyen M.T. Bandyopadyhay G. Leung H.Y. Watt M.J. Benner C. Febbraio M.A. Nguyen A.K. Folian B. Subramaniam S. Gonzalez F.J. Glass C.K. Ricote M. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 1658-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The chemiluminescence kit from Pierce was used for detection of signals. RNA was extracted using an RNA purification kit (RNeasy Plus, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. After DNase digestion, 100 ng of RNA was transcribed into cDNA in a 20-μl reaction using a High Capacity cDNA Archive kit, analyzed, and amplified. PCR was performed in a 25-μl reaction containing 5 μl of cDNA (one-fifth diluted), 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, and a 400 nm concentration of each primer. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were used to calculate the amount of amplified PCR product relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 18 S rRNA. Primary hepatocytes were preincubated with 10 μm myristoylated conventional PKC (cPKC) peptide inhibitor (cPI; myr-RFARKGALRQKNV; Promega) for 1 h followed by incubation with PST (100 nm) for 30 min and then with insulin (20 nm) for 15 min. Hepatocytes were chilled, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (all from Sigma) as described by Backer et al. (18Backer J.M. Schroeder G.G. Kahn C.R. Myers Jr., M.G. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1367-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot of 500 μg of total cell protein extract used for each reaction was immunoprecipitated in lysis buffer with 4 μg of anti-insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1/2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc). Immunoprecipitates were washed and analyzed for PI 3-kinase activity as described by Backer et al. (18Backer J.M. Schroeder G.G. Kahn C.R. Myers Jr., M.G. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1367-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We purchased peptide inhibitors PKCθ pseudosubstrate (sc-3097), PKCζ pseudosubstrate (sc-3098), PKCϵ peptide inhibitor (sc-3095), and PKCα peptide inhibitor (C2–4) (sc-3094) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and non-peptide inhibitors LY333531 (IC50 for PKCβI and PKCβII, 5–6 nm), rottlerin (IC50 for PKCδ, 4 nm), and Gö6976 (IC50 for PKCα and PKCβ, 3–6 nm) from Calbiochem. Primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells were incubated with 10 μm peptide inhibitors, 10 μm cPI, and 10 nm non-peptide inhibitors for 1 h followed by incubation with PST 100 nm for 15 min. After treatment, cells were chilled, washed, and lysed as described above. The kinase reaction mixture (120 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 25 μm phosphatidylserine, 6 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5000–8000 cpm/pmol), and 25 μm peptide substrate derived from neurogranin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In some assays, PMA (1 μm) or 1:2 diolein (10 μm) was used as diacylglycerol. Reactions were initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP, proceeded for 10 min at 30 °C with linear kinetics, and were terminated by spotting on phosphocellulose papers. Papers were washed six times with 5% acetic acid. The radioactivities on the papers were analyzed by counting. All assays were performed in six replicates and expressed as the mean value ±S.E. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Curve fitting was accomplished in the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Multiple comparisons were made using either one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test or two-way ANOVA. Statistical significance was concluded at p < 0.05. The gain in body weight (Fig. 1A) and total fat mass were 20 and 25%, respectively (Fig. 1B) in 6-month-old KO mice. After adjusting for increased body weight, the gain in fat mass was 25% of the gain in body weight. Total abdominal fat was also increased (by ∼48%) predominantly at the epididymal and subepidermal regions and surrounding the adrenal gland (Fig. 1, C and D). Relative to WT, plasma triglyceride, NEFA, and IL-6 levels were lower (Fig. 1, E–G), whereas those of adiponectin and leptin (adjusted to fat mass) were higher in KO mice (Fig. 1G). Because IL-6 was shown to be elevated in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (19Bastard J.P. Jardel C. Bruckert E. Blondy P. Capeau J. Laville M. Vidal H. Hainque B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 3338-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) and adiponectin was shown to improve insulin sensitivity (20Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Müller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar, 21Kadowaki T. Yamauchi T. Kubota N. Hara K. Ueki K. Tobe K. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar), these findings correlate well with the data on hypertensive KO mice (decreased IL-6 and increased adiponectin levels), suggesting increased insulin sensitivity. The increase in fat mass may result from elevated lipid uptake and storage. Basal insulin levels were markedly (79%) lower in KO than WT mice (Fig. 2A). This is attributed to enhanced insulin clearance (as suggested by the ∼6-fold increase in the steady state C-peptide/insulin ratio; Fig. 2B) but not reduced insulin secretion (as suggested by intact plasma C-peptide levels; Fig. 2A). The rapid initial rise in insulin levels during the first 7 min postglucose administration (Fig. 2C) suggests that the insulin secretion rate in response to glucose may instead be twice as high in KO mice lacking PST versus WT (0.107 versus 0.057 ng/ml/min in WT; p < 0.05) (Fig. 2C). Although actual assessment of insulin secretion by intravenous GTT was not carried out, a number of previous publications, either in perfused pancreas or in isolated beta cells, have demonstrated that PST inhibits the first phase of glucose-induced insulin secretion primarily by inhibiting a G-protein-coupled rise in calcium (22Efendiæ S. Tatemoto K. Mutt V. Quan C. Chang D. Ostenson C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 7257-7260Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Ahrén B. Bertrand G. Roye M. Ribes G. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1996; 158: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Ma H.T. Kato M. Tatemoto K. Regul. Pept. 1996; 61: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 25Hertelendy Z.I. Patel D.G. Knittel J.J. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, mice with PST deficiency might have enhanced insulin secretion during GTT. Despite lower basal insulin levels (Fig. 2A), fasting blood glucose levels were normal in KO as compared with WT mice (Fig. 2A). Moreover insulin (Fig. 2C; area under the curve, 71.0 ± 6.6 versus 34.4 ± 9.5 ng/min/dl in WT; p < 0.008) and glucose (Fig. 2D; area under the curve, 5462.5 ± 582.3 versus 7918.8 ± 532 mg/min/dl in WT; p < 0.009) excursions in response to glucose challenge during an intraperitoneal GTT were significantly improved. This suggests that KO mice are insulin-sensitive. In an ITT in 3-month-old mice, hypoglycemia was comparable between WT (51%) and KO (50%) mice (Fig. 2E), which returned to the basal level 120 min after insulin injection. In 6-month-old WT mice, hypoglycemia during ITT was lesser (by 11%), and the recovery from hypoglycemia was faster (90 min) as compared with 3-month-old mice (Fig. 2F). In contrast, in 6-month-old KO mice, although hypoglycemia was comparable between 3- and 6-month-old mice, the blood glucose did not return to the control level even after 150 min of insulin injection (Fig. 2F). This could be attributed to elevated glucose disposal and/or reduced gluconeogenesis in KO mice. In response to glucose challenge, the plasma glucagon level dropped to a similar extent in WT (by 14.8%) and KO (by 17.6%) mice (Fig. 2F). This rules out a potential differential regulation of insulin action by glucagon in KO and WT mice. Fasting blood glucose was slightly lower in WT versus KO mice (Fig. 3A). During the clamp, a steady state blood glucose concentration of ∼120 mg/dl was reached at ∼70 min and was maintained until the clamp was completed at 130 min. Blood glucose was maintained at a steady state level. Fig. 3B demonstrates that the specific activity of the tracer was in steady state at the end of the clamp, although the specific activity was significantly higher in KO versus WT at the end of the clamp period (p < 0.05). There was no difference in specific activity during the basal infusion period. The overall glucose infusion rate required to maintain euglycemia during the clamp was comparable in WT and KO mice (Fig. 3C), suggesting that whole body insulin sensitivity was comparable between groups. However, the total glucose disposal rate during the clamp (GDRtotal) was 35% lower in KO versus WT mice (Fig. 3D). In line with this, the insulin-stimulated GDR (which is calculated as GDRclamp − GDRbasal), which primarily represents glucose disposal by skeletal muscle, was reduced by ∼68% in KO compared with WT mice (Fig. 3E; p < 0.006). This finding is surprising given the positive effect of adiponectin on glucose transport in muscle (26Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Minokoshi Y. Ito Y. Waki H. Uchida S. Yamashita S. Noda M. Kita S. Ueki K. Eto K. Akanuma Y. Froguel P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Carling D. Kimura S. Nagai R. Kahn B.B. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar, 27Ceddia R.B. Somwar R. Maida A. Fang X. Bikopoulos G. Sweeney G. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and L6 muscle cells (Fig. 3G). Nonetheless these data indicate that, in vivo, KO mice develop insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. In contrast to the insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, hepatic insulin sensitivity was significantly higher in KO mice compared with WT mice as evidenced by a greater suppression (by 32.2%) of hepatic glucose production during the clamp (Fig. 3F; p < 0.0001). Fasting hepatic glucose production/GDR was not different between groups (WT versus KO, 20 ± 2 versus 24 ± 3 mg/kg/min; p value not significant). The improved hepatic insulin sensitivity could, at least in part, be due to higher adiponectin levels (28Zhou H. Song X. Briggs M. Violand B. Salsgiver W. Gulve E.A. Luo Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Combs T.P. Berg A.H. Obici S. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Moreover the improved hepatic insulin sensitivity likely compensates for the muscle insulin resistance found in the KO mice and thus contributes to the preserved euglycemic phenotype of the KO mouse. Increased insulin receptor activity may also contribute as we saw increased basal Tyr(P)-insulin receptor signaling in liver (results not presented). A reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis in KO mice is further supported by a marked decrease in glucose production in response to pyruvate (Fig. 4A; area under the curve, 1738 ± 405 versus 3612 ± 393 mg/min/dl in WT mice; p < 0.006). Moreover mRNA levels of gluconeogenic genes, such as Pepck1 and G6pase, were 61.0–71% lower in KO than WT mice (Fig. 4B). Conversely pretreatment of KO mice with PST restored Pepck1 and G6pase mRNA levels (Fig. 4B) and glucose production in response to pyruvate (Fig. 4A). Together with higher hepatic glycogen content (Fig. 4C), which is in part mediated by reduced glycogenolysis, these results emphasize higher insulin sensitivity in KO mice. The mRNA levels of lipogenic genes such as Srebp1c, Pparγ, and Gpat were high in KO mice and were conversely reduced by PST treatment (Fig. 4D). There was no significant change in Fasn expression between WT and KO mice (Fig. 4D). However, hepatic triglyceride content was intact (Fig. 4C). This could, at least in part, be due to elevated fatty acid β-oxidation in KO mice as suggested by higher levels of ketone bodies (Fig. 4E), phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Fig. 4F), and uncoupling protein 2 gene (Ucp2) (Fig. 4G). Increased ketone bodies point to diversion of the fatty acid oxidation product, acetyl-CoA, to ketogenesis. Increased fatty acid oxidation could also underlie reduction in plasma NEFA levels (Fig. 1F). Lower plasma triglyceride levels (Fig. 1E) together with increased abdominal obesity suggest potential redistribution of lipid to the adipose tissue for storage. The basal plasma PST level dropped significantly (by 12%) 30 min following insulin injection before it returned to normal (Fig. 5A), indicating an inverse relationship between plasma PST and insulin. In primary hepatocytes, PST effectively antagonizes the suppressive effect of insulin on glucose production from lactate and pyruvate (Fig. 5B). The restoration of mRNA levels of gluconeogenic genes (Fig. 4B"

What moderate chronic hypoventilation adds to obesity on systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction remains unknown. Question To compare inflammatory status and endothelial function in OHS versus eucapnic obese patients. Methodology 14 OHS and 39 eucapnic obese patients matched for BMI and age were compared. Diurnal blood gazes, overnight polysomnography and endothelial function, measured by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT), were assessed. Inflammatory (Leptin, RANTES, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, Resistin) and anti-inflammatory (adiponectin, IL-1Ra) cytokines were measured by multiplex beads immunoassays. Principal Findings OHS exhibited a higher PaCO2, a lower forced vital capacity (FVC) and tended to have a lower PaO2 than eucapnic obese patients. HS-CRP, RANTES levels and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were significantly increased in OHS (respectively 11.1±10.9 vs. 5.7±5.5 mg.l−1 for HS-CRP, 55.9±55.3 vs 23.3±15.8 ng/ml for RANTES and 7.3±4.3 vs 6.1±1.7 for HbA1c). Serum adiponectin was reduced in OHS (7606±2977 vs 13660±7854 ng/ml). Endothelial function was significantly more impaired in OHS (RH-PAT index: 0.22±0.06 vs 0.51±0.11). Conclusions Compared to eucapnic obesity, OHS is associated with a specific increase in the pro-atherosclerotic RANTES chemokine, a decrease in the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin and impaired endothelial function. These three conditions are known to be strongly associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00603096"
https://openalex.org/W2091026319,"Parkinson disease (PD) is caused by loss of dopamine, which is synthesized from tyrosine by two enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and 4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine decarboxylase (DDC). DJ-1 is a causative gene for the familial form of PD, but little is known about the roles of DJ-1 in dopamine synthesis. In this study, we found that DJ-1 directly bound to TH and DDC and positively regulated their activities in human dopaminergic cells. Mutants of DJ-1 found in PD patients, including heterozygous mutants, lost their activity and worked as dominant-negative forms toward wild-type DJ-1. When cells were treated with H(2)O(2), 6-hydroxydopamine, or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, changes in activities of TH and DDC accompanied by oxidation of cysteine 106 of DJ-1 occurred. It was found that DJ-1 possessing Cys-106 with SH and SOH forms was active and that DJ-1 possessing Cys-106 with SO(2)H and SO(3)H forms was inactive in terms of stimulation of TH and DDC activities. These findings indicate an essential role of DJ-1 in dopamine synthesis and contribution of DJ-1 to the sporadic form of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2026876070,"The cellular and molecular pathways that regulate platelet activation, blood coagulation, and inflammation are emerging as critical players in cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we demonstrate a novel signaling mechanism whereby protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) mediates expression of melanoma cell adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 (MUC18), a critical marker of melanoma metastasis, via activation of platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). We found that PAR1 silencing with small hairpin RNA inhibits MUC18 expression in metastatic melanoma cells by inhibiting CREB phosphorylation, activity, and binding to the MUC18 promoter. We further demonstrate that the PAF/PAFR pathway mediates MUC18 expression downstream of PAR1. Indeed, PAR1 silencing down-regulates PAFR expression and PAF production, PAFR silencing blocks MUC18 expression, and re-expression of PAFR in PAR1-silenced cells rescues MUC18 expression. We further demonstrate that the PAR1-PAFR-MUC18 pathway mediates melanoma cell adhesion to microvascular endothelial cells, transendothelial migration, and metastatic retention in the lungs. Rescuing PAFR expression in PAR1-silenced cells fully restores metastatic phenotype of melanoma, indicating that PAFR plays critical role in the molecular mechanism of PAR1 action.

Mediators like thrombin are abundant in the tumor microenvironment; tumor cells, owing to their aberrant expression of tissue factor, catalyze thrombin production on their surface (4Fischer E.G.

Nierodzik et al. also demonstrated that PAR1 expression is a rate-limited factor in thrombin-mediated lung metastasis.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms of how PAR1 contributes to the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype of melanoma are not yet defined. Herein, we demonstrate that, in melanoma, PAR1 works in concert with another G-protein-coupled receptor, platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR), to mediate the expression of melanoma cell adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 (MUC18) by activating CREB transcription factor. By using RNA interference approach to target PAR1, PAFR, or MUC18 expression, we further demonstrate that PAR1-PAFR-MUC18 pathway mediates melanoma cell adhesion to microvascular endothelial cells, transendothelial migration, and metastatic retention in the lungs. Identification of this new pathway that connects two pro-inflammatory G-protein-coupled receptors, PAR1 and PAFR, with the adhesion molecule MUC18 provides a molecular link between the inflammatory microenvironment and melanoma metastasis. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho(Ser-133)-CREB antibody, rabbit polyclonal antibody against total CREB, and rabbit polyclonal antibody against Sp1 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-PAFR antibody was from Cayman Biochemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Fully human anti-MUC18 antibody ABX-MA1 was from Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-PAR1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A375SM human melanoma cells were described elsewhere (26Melnikova V.O. Mourad-Zeidan A.A. Lev D.C. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2911-2922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). C8161-c9 human melanoma cells were a gift from Dr. D. R. Welch (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham) (27Welch D.R. Bisi J.E. Miller B.E. Conaway D. Seftor E.A. Yohem K.H. Gilmore L.B. Seftor R.E. Nakajima M. Hendrix M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 47: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) were from PromoCell (Germany). Stable silencing of PAR1 was performed using pLVTHM lentiviral vector coding for shRNA against the human PAR1 gene sequence AGATTAGTCTCCATCAATA as described previously (13Villares G.J. Zigler M. Wang H. Melnikova V.O. Wu H. Friedman R. Leslie M.C. Vivas-Mejia P.E. Lopez-Berestein G. Sood A.K. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 9078-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, sense and antisense shRNA oligonucleotides targeting PAR1 gene and the nontargeting (NT) sequence with no sequence homology to any known human mRNA (TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)) were designed with a hairpin and sticky ends (Cla1 and Mlu1) for use with the lentiviral system developed and kindly provided by Didier Trono (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland (28Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar)). The oligonucleotides were annealed into the lentiviral gene transfer vector, pLVTHM, using the Cla1 and Mlu1 restriction enzyme sites. Following sequence verification, lentivirus was produced by transfecting human embryonic kidney cells (293FT, Invitrogen) with the pLVTHM-shNT control or pLVTHM-shPAR1 vector, MD2G packaging plasmid (Invitrogen), and PAX2 envelope plasmid (Invitrogen). Seventy-two hours later, the viral supernatant was collected and filtered to remove cellular debris. The recombinant lentivirus was titrated according to the GFP positivity by flow cytometry in A375SM or C8161-c9 cells. The melanoma cell transduction was typically performed with the viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5. The highly metastatic and PAR1-positive A375SM and C8161 cell lines were plated at 70% confluency in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cell/well) and, 16 h later, transduced with the virus. After 16 h, the virus-containing medium was removed and replaced with normal growth medium. Following transduction with pLVTHM-shNT control or pLVTHM-shPAR1 virus, PAR1/GFP double-positive (shNT) or PAR1-negative/GFP-positive (shPAR1) cells were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting after staining with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-PAR1 antibody (13Villares G.J. Zigler M. Wang H. Melnikova V.O. Wu H. Friedman R. Leslie M.C. Vivas-Mejia P.E. Lopez-Berestein G. Sood A.K. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 9078-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Stable silencing of PAFR, MUC18, and CREB was achieved by transducing cells with a pLVTHM lentiviral construct coding for shRNA against the human PAFR gene sequence GGGATATCTACTGTGGTCT, or against the human MUC18 gene sequence ACATCGATCTGAGGCATTA, or against the human CREB gene sequence GAGAGAGGTCCGTCTAATG (29Dobroff A.S. Wang H. Melnikova V.O. Villares G.J. Zigler M. Huang L. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; (7 24)10.1074/jbc.M109.019836Google Scholar), as described above. The transduced, GFP-positive cells were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. PAFR, MUC18, or CREB expression was verified by Western blot. PAFR siRNA purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) was used to silence PAFR expression in melanoma cell lines (target sequence: CAACGUCACUCGCUGCUUU). NT siRNA (Qiagen), with no sequence homology to any known human mRNA, was used as control (target sequence: UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU). A375SM or C8161-c9 cells were grown to 60% confluency in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with PAFR siRNA or NT siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. PAFR protein expression was analyzed 72 h later. For stable PAR1 re-expression (rescue experiment) in C8161-c9 and A375SM PAR1-silenced cells, PAR1 expression construct with an N-terminal prolactin signal peptide and FLAG tag (kindly provided by Shaun R. Coughlin, University of California, San Francisco, CA) was combined with shRNA-non-targetable PAR1 coding region (7-bp silent mutations that will not be recognized by PAR1 shRNA). The resulting open reading frame insert was then ligated into the pLVX-DsRed-Monomer-C1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) replacing the red protein coding sequence of DsRed. The recombinant lentivirus was produced by transfecting 293FT cells with the sequenced-verified pLVX-PAR1 vector, MD2G packaging plasmid, and PAX2 envelope plasmid (Invitrogen) as described above. The recombinant lentivirus was titrated according to the GFP positivity by flow cytometry in A375SM or C8161-c9 cells. Melanoma cells were seeded in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cell/well) and, 16 h later, transduced with the virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Following cell transduction with the control pLVX-ev or pLVX-PAR1 virus, the population of puromycin-resistant cells was selected. For transient PAFR re-expression in A375SM or C8161-c9 PAR1-silenced cells, the open reading frame of an intronless PAFR gene was amplified from C8161-c9 genomic DNA using forward primer GGGAATTCCATATGGAGCCACATGACTCCTCCCAC and reverse primer CCCAAGCTTCTAATTTTTGAGGGAATTGCCAGG. The PCR product was digested and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector. Melanoma cells were plated at a 70% confluency in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cell/well) and, 16 h later, transfected with 4 μg of control empty pcDNA3.1 or PAFR expression vectors. 48 h later, cells were either lysed for protein extraction or collected for the endothelial cell attachment or in vivo lung attachment assays. For the later assay, cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine (20 μCi) for the last 24 h of the post-transfection incubation period (as described below under “Animals and Tumor Cell Lung Seeding Assay”). For stable MUC18 re-expression in C8161-c9 PAR1-silenced cells, the open reading frame of MUC18 gene was amplified from cDNA prepared by reverse transcription of C8161-c9-derived RNA. The PCR product was digested and cloned into lentiviral pLVTHM expression vector (28Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The recombinant lentivirus was produced as described above and titrated according to the GFP positivity by flow cytometry in C8161-c9 cells. Melanoma cells were seeded in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cell/well) and, 16 h later, transduced with the virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Following transduction of C8161-c9 shPAR1 cells with control pLVTHM or pLVTHM-MUC18 virus, the population of puromycin-resistant cells was selected. MUC18 promoter reporter was created by amplifying a 673-bp MUC18 promoter region (−644 to +29 relative to the transcription start site) from C8161-c9 genomic DNA using forward primer CTAGCTAGCACTTGCAGGAGCTTGAGTTTGAAGG and reverse primer GCCCAAGCTTGCTTCCCGGCCGGAGGAGAGCCAAG. The fragment was digested and ligated to a pGL4.12-Luc2-cp vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The cAMP response element (CRE)-driven luciferase reporter vector pGL3-CRE was described previously (26Melnikova V.O. Mourad-Zeidan A.A. Lev D.C. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2911-2922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent as previously described (26Melnikova V.O. Mourad-Zeidan A.A. Lev D.C. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2911-2922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For promoter reporter assays, 1 μg of the firefly luciferase reporter and 5 ng of CMV-driven Renilla luciferase reporter (pRL-CMV, Promega) plasmids were used for co-transfections of melanoma cells plated in 24-well plates. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h (MUC18 reporter) or 24 h (CRE reporter) post transfection using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The ratio of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency. For transient PAFR overexpression, cells were analyzed after 48 h. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (26Melnikova V.O. Mourad-Zeidan A.A. Lev D.C. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2911-2922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PAR1 immunoprecipitation was performed using monoclonal anti-PAR1 antibody and protein G-PLUS agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as previously described (26Melnikova V.O. Mourad-Zeidan A.A. Lev D.C. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2911-2922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Lipid fractions were removed from cell pellets using a modified version of the Bligh and Dyer extraction method (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar); formic acid was added to lower the aqueous phase pH to 3.0 (31Bussolati B. Biancone L. Cassoni P. Russo S.

Lipids were purified using lipid purification columns (Amersham Biosciences). PAF levels were quantified using scintillation proximity assay for PAF (Amersham Biosciences) as instructed by the manufacturer. Scintillation proximity assay detects a decrease in binding of a [3H]PAF tracer (also used as a standard) to an anti-PAF antibody, immobilized on scintillant beads, in the presence of cell-derived PAF. ChIP assay was performed using a ChIP-IT Express kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) as described previously (32Mourad-Zeidan A.A. Melnikova V.O. Wang H. Raz A. Bar-Eli M. Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 173: 1839-1852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PCR amplification of a 258-bp fragment spanning the −204 to +54 region of the MUC18 promoter was performed using forward primer sequence 5′-AGTGGTAAGACATTTGCCCGAGGT-3′ and reverse primer sequence 5′-TTTCCCTCCCTGACAGCCTTCTTT-3′. Attachment of melanoma cells to HDMECs was assayed in 24-well plates, after 16-h co-culture as described previously for HUVECs (33Mills L. Tellez C. Huang S. Baker C. McCarty M. Green L. Gudas J.M. Feng X. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5106-5114PubMed Google Scholar). Cell diapedesis across a monolayer of HDMECs was measured using the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technique (ECIS Model 1600, Applied BioPhysics, Troy, NY), which detects a decrease in endothelial cell resistance due to retraction of endothelial cell monolayers after the addition of melanoma cells. Briefly, 8-well ECIS arrays were coated with rat-tail collagen type I (BD Biosciences), and HDMECs (5 × 105 cells per well) or media only were plated and allowed to form monolayers. A baseline impedance measurement for the endothelial monolayer was monitored for 3–4 h. Then, melanoma cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were added. During 24-h data acquisition, the impedance of HDMECs alone remained stable. Data plots are representative of triplicate experiments, with each graph showing impedance readings from a separate well. Each time point is the mean impedance, normalized to the initial value, at 10 distinct electrodes per well. All experiments with female athymic BALB/c nude mice (NCI-Frederick Cancer Research Facility, Frederick, MD) were performed according to regulations approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For lung seeding assay, melanoma cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine (20 μCi) for 24 h. Aliquots were used to determine [3H]thymidine incorporation (cpm/1 × 106 cells). A total of 0.5 × 106 cells was injected into the lateral tail veins of nude mice. Twenty-four hours after injection, the mice were killed, and the lungs were resected, washed with water, and weighed. Tissues were digested in 10 n NaOH solution for 24 h. Radioactivity was counted, normalized to the injected cpm, and expressed as the amount of radioactivity retained per gram of tissue. Results were evaluated using a two-tailed Student's t test. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We have previously shown that PAR1 expression increases during melanoma progression (17Tellez C.S. Davis D.W. Prieto V.G. Gershenwald J.E. Johnson M.M. McCarty M.F. Bar-Eli M. J. Invest.

Furthermore, down-regulating PAR1 expression in metastatic melanoma cells significantly inhibits their metastatic potential in vivo (13Villares G.J. Zigler M. Wang H. Melnikova V.O. Wu H. Friedman R.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms of how PAR1 contributes to melanoma metastasis, we stably silenced PAR1 expression in two highly metastatic melanoma cell lines, A375SM and C8161-c9, using a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and a lentiviral delivery system, described previously (13Villares G.J. Zigler M. Wang H. Melnikova V.O. Wu H. Friedman R. Leslie M.C. Vivas-Mejia P.E. Lopez-Berestein G. Sood A.K. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 9078-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-PAR1 antibody followed by Western blot analysis confirmed that PAR1 expression was down-regulated by 95% in A375SM cells and by 58% in C8161-c9 cells that had been transduced with shRNA targeting PAR1 (shPAR1), as compared with cells that had been transduced with nontargeting shRNA (shNT) (Fig. 1A). The A375SM PAR1-silenced cells and cells transduced with non-targeting control shRNA were subjected to cDNA microarray to identify possible downstream target genes regulated by PAR1, as previously described (34Villares G.J Dobroff A.S. Wang H. Zigler M. Melnikova V.O. Huang L. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 6730-6737Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The melanoma cell adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 was found to be down-regulated by 9.6-fold following PAR1 silencing in A375SM cells. We and others have previously demonstrated that MUC18 plays a major role in melanoma metastasis by mediating heterotypic interactions between metastatic melanoma cells and endothelial cells (33Mills L.

We showed recently that the purified short isoform of Mgm1 (s-Mgm1) possesses GTPase activity, self-assembles into low order oligomers, and interacts specifically with negatively charged phospholipids (Meglei, G., and McQuibban, G. A. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 1774–1784). Here, we demonstrate that s-Mgm1 binds to a mixture of phospholipids characteristic of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Binding to physiologically representative lipids results in ∼50-fold stimulation of s-Mgm1 GTPase activity. s-Mgm1 point mutants that are defective in oligomerization and lipid binding do not exhibit such stimulation and do not function in vivo. Electron microscopy and lipid turbidity assays demonstrate that s-Mgm1 promotes liposome interaction. Furthermore, s-Mgm1 assembles onto liposomes as oligomeric rings with 3-fold symmetry. The projection map of negatively stained s-Mgm1 shows six monomers, consistent with two stacked trimers. Taken together, our data identify a lipid-binding domain in Mgm1, and the structural analysis suggests a model of how Mgm1 promotes the fusion of opposing mitochondrial inner membranes.

Vogel F. Neupert W. Reichert A.S. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 2237-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is proposed that l-Mgm1 serves as a receptor for s-Mgm1 to mediate fusion of opposing membranes upon GTP hydrolysis. Here, we provide molecular data indicating that lipid binding of s-Mgm1 is required for proper membrane fusion. Furthermore, structural analysis of s-Mgm1 assembled onto liposomes suggests a model whereby stacked trimers of s-Mgm1 on opposing membranes would facilitate fusion. long Mgm1 short Mgm1 inner membrane wild-type pleckstrin homology electron microscopy. WT s-Mgm1 and point mutants were purified in buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol as described previously (6Meglei G. McQuibban G.A. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For all subsequent in vitro assays presented here, purified WT s-Mgm1 and point mutants were diluted into buffers containing 170 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol immediately prior to the assay. A 10 mg/ml chloroform solution of lipid (Avanti Polar Lipids) was dried by rotary evaporation and vacuum pump, yielding a thin lipid film. The lipid suspension in physiological salt buffer was extruded 15 times through a 1-μm polycarbonate NucleoporeTM track-etched membrane (Whatman) to generate unilamellar vesicles. IM liposomes were prepared with the corresponding physiological concentrations: cardiolipin, 16%; phosphatidylethanolamine, 24%; phosphatidic acid, 2%; phosphatidylserine, 4%; phosphatidylcholine, 38%; and phosphatidylinositol, 16%. 2 μg of total lipid was added to each well of a 96-well plate and allowed to coat overnight. Following 5% bovine serum albumin block, Mgm1 proteins were added at the concentrations indicated. Binding was detected using primary antibody directed against His6-tagged Mgm1, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Color development was monitored at 655 nm using tetramethylbenzidine as a horseradish peroxidase substrate. Gel filtration and CD analysis were done as described previously (6Meglei G. McQuibban G.A. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The malachite green colorimetric phosphate assay was performed as described previously (6Meglei G. McQuibban G.A. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The kinetic mode of a Thermo Scientific BioMateTM 3 UV-visible spectrophotometer was used to measure the change in A350 to monitor change in particle size in real time. s-Mgm1 was diluted into low salt buffer and incubated with liposome solution at room temperature for 15 min. The sample was blotted onto an EM grid and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. The samples were visualized using a Tecnai F20 electron microscope (FEI Co., Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with a field emission gun and operating at 200 kV. Images were recorded at a magnification of ×50,000. Two-dimensional crystal analysis was performed as described previously (10Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 11Gipson B. Zeng X. Zhang Z.Y. Stahlberg H. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Plasmid shuffle complementation and imaging of mitochondrial morphology were performed as described previously (8McQuibban G.A. Saurya S. Freeman M. Nature. 2003; 423: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In our previous study (6Meglei G. McQuibban G.A. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), s-Mgm1 interactions with single phospholipids were assayed by lipid overlay Western blotting. Here, we conducted an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to quantitatively monitor the association of s-Mgm1 and several potential lipid-binding point mutants within the putative lipid-binding domain with liposomes with a composition characteristic of the mitochondrial IM. Sequence alignment of 22 fungal sequences homologous to Mgm1 identified several conserved lysines (Lys544, Lys566, Lys724, Lys745, Lys795, and Lys804) that could serve as interaction motifs for the negatively charged phospholipids (Fig. 1A). In addition, we included Lys854 in our analyses, as this residue is known to be required for s-Mgm1 protein oligomerization (6Meglei G. McQuibban G.A. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous report, K795A was severely compromised in lipid binding (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, K566A and K724A displayed a significant reduction in lipid binding compared with WT s-Mgm1 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, K544A, K745A, K804A, and K854A showed little difference in lipid binding compared with WT s-Mgm1 (Fig. 1B). In addition to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay approach, we also conducted a spectroscopic turbidity assay (12Connell E. Scott P. Davletov B. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 377: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This assay measures the ability of Mgm1 not only to interact with liposomes but also to induce aggregation presumably based on trans-interactions of Mgm1 on opposing liposomes. WT s-Mgm1, K544A, K745A, and K854A were able to induce significant liposome aggregation, whereas K724A and K804A induced moderate liposome aggregation (Fig. 1C). K566A and K795A were completely devoid of this activity (Fig. 1C). To demonstrate that the mutant Mgm1 proteins did not undergo significant protein misfolding, we conducted gel filtration and CD analysis (Fig. 1, D and E). The traces of K566A, K724A, and K795A overlapped that of WT Mgm1 in both assays, indicating that these point mutants maintain proper folding and oligomerization properties. These results demonstrate that several conserved lysines in this region of s-Mgm1 are required to maintain proper lipid interaction. Given the position of this domain between the middle and GTPase effector domains of Mgm1, we propose that this region provides a lipid interaction interface similar to the PH domain in other dynamins (13Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Previously, we characterized the GTPase activity of purified Mgm1, which was consistent with a basal level of hydrolysis found in other dynamins (6Meglei G. McQuibban G.A. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Classical dynamins are known to undergo stimulated GTPase activity upon lipid-induced oligomerization (14Mears J.A. Hinshaw J.E. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 88: 237-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We therefore tested for the ability of a variety of phospholipids to stimulate the activity of s-Mgm1. Of the lipids tested, we found that phosphatidylserine stimulated the GTPase activity of s-Mgm1 by 55-fold, whereas phosphatidic acid- and cardiolipin-containing liposomes resulted in GTPase stimulation of 14- and 9-fold, respectively (Fig. 2A). Importantly, these are the lipids we reported previously that s-Mgm1 binds, and cardiolipin is physiologically relevant to the mitochondrial IM (15Schlame M. Hostetler K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we tested whether a mixture of lipids representing the content of the mitochondrial IM could stimulate s-Mgm1 GTPase activity. Our IM liposomes had the following content: 16% cardiolipin, 24% phosphatidylethanolamine, 2% phosphatidic acid, 4% phosphatidylserine, 38% phosphatidylcholine, and 16% phosphatidylinositol. IM liposomes were able to stimulate the GTPase activity by 6-fold in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2, A and B). These results demonstrate that Mgm1 behaves similarly to other dynamin proteins and suggest that lipid interaction is mechanistically important for Mgm1 to function at the mitochondrial IM. Classical dynamins have a PH domain between the middle and GTPase effector domains that mediates lipid association (13Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). We have now identified several conserved lysines that contribute to lipid binding (Fig. 1, A–C) and suggest that they form a lipid-binding module in Mgm1. We therefore determined whether these mutants are impaired in IM liposome-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. K566A, K724A, K795A, and K854A have lost the ability to undergo significant lipid-dependent stimulation, whereas K544A, K745A, and K804A maintain IM-mediated stimulated GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 2C). K854A does not undergo oligomerization (6Meglei G. McQuibban G.A. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) but maintains lipid interaction (Fig. 1B) and serves as a control for oligomerization-dependent stimulation (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that both phospholipid interaction and oligomerization are necessary for stimulated GTPase activity and that Mgm1 contains a lipid interaction domain similar to the PH domain in other dynamins. Lipid-stimulated GTPase activities of other dynamins have been well studied and are due to self-assembly of the dynamin onto liposomes. We have investigated the effect of s-Mgm1 self-assembly on GTPase activity. We have shown previously that s-Mgm1 can self-assemble into low order oligomers under high salt conditions. Here, we determined the GTPase activity of WT s-Mgm1 and the oligomerization-defective mutant K854A at various protein concentrations under low salt (170 mm NaCl) conditions. We found that GTP hydrolysis of WT s-Mgm1 increased in a nonlinear fashion compared with the oligomerization-defective mutant K854A (Fig. 3, A and B). The sigmoidal curve in the activity plot indicates positive cooperativity at low concentrations of the WT. A sharp increase in WT GTPase activity was observed at protein concentrations of 0.2–0.4 μm. In contrast, we observed a slow increase in GTP hydrolysis for the K854A mutant. These data further support the idea that oligomerization of s-Mgm1 is essential for its GTPase activity and function. To further understand the biological role of Mgm1 lipid binding, we conducted complementation studies in yeast using a plasmid shuffle approach. We tested the ability of K544A, K566A, K724A, K745A, K795A, and K804A to restore normal growth and normal mitochondrial morphology to cells lacking WT Mgm1. K566A and K795A could not complement mitochondrial morphology or growth (Fig. 4, A and C). K544A and K724A displayed some rescue of mitochondrial morphology. K745A and K804A retained almost WT levels of mitochondrial morphology and growth (Fig. 4, A and C). Importantly, all mutants were expressed at similar levels and produced equivalent amounts of both l-Mgm1 and s-Mgm1 (Fig. 4D). Consistently, the in vivo complementation ability of these point mutants correlates well with the in vitro ability of these mutants to interact with and be stimulated by IM lipids. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the lipid-binding activity of Mgm1 is required for this protein to function properly in vivo and provide compelling evidence that Mgm1 contains a lipid-binding domain. The self-assembly of dynamins onto lipids and their ability to promote tubulation of liposomes have been thoroughly studied and visualized by EM (14Mears J.A. Hinshaw J.E. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 88: 237-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether s-Mgm1 can induce tubulation of IM liposomes. Instead of tubulation, we observed that s-Mgm1 induced the assembly of liposomes into aggregates compared with a bovine serum albumin control (Fig. 5, A and B). In agreement with the lipid binding studies above, we found that the lipid-binding mutant K795A could not induce liposome aggregation (Fig. 5A). In addition, we found that the oligomerization-defective mutant K854A was also impaired in lipid aggregation. These results indicate that both lipid binding and Mgm1 assembly into oligomers are required to induce liposome assembly. Although s-Mgm1 on its own did not induce liposome tubulation, EM analysis revealed arrays of s-Mgm1 rings on IM liposomes (Fig. 6A). The arrays were composed of regions of ordered lattice. Processing of images with two-dimensional crystal analysis software (11Gipson B. Zeng X. Zhang Z.Y. Stahlberg H. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) showed that well ordered regions contain a single lattice with p3 symmetry. To calculate an average projection of the stained s-Mgm1 oligomer, ∼1000 images of oligomers were interactively selected from images of crystals and treated as unordered single particles. Oligomer images were rotationally and translationally aligned and averaged without assuming any symmetry. The resulting average revealed six densities arranged with clear 3-fold symmetry. The diameter of each unit density is ∼50 Å, which is consistent with an 86-kDa s-Mgm1 monomer. A high signal-to-noise symmetrized average and contour map are shown in Fig. 6 (B and C). Given the clear difference in staining of the two different types of monomer in the hexamer, we propose that this reflects two s-Mgm1 trimers that have stacked on top of each other with a 60° rotational offset. This orientation of s-Mgm1 trimers assembled onto liposomes suggests a mechanism of membrane fusion: trimers of s-Mgm1 on opposing membranes could stack on each other, and GTP hydrolysis might induce a conformational change to induce fusion of the lipids and subsequent release of the stacked trimer. Further studies will be required to understand the exact mechanism of Mgm1-mediated membrane fusion, but our data pinpoint the critical requirement for lipid association of Mgm1 to function in mitochondrial dynamics.

The proteolytic processing of SREBPs is highly controlled by the interaction between two ER membrane proteins, SCAP and the insulin-inducing gene (INSIG). Once the ER membrane cholesterol content increases, SCAP binds cholesterol, thereby leading to a conformational change in the membrane domain, the so-called sterol-sensing domain (SSD). This domain resembles sequences in certain other proteins that are postulated to interact with sterols: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the Niemann-Pick C1 protein, and Patched (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the conformational change promotes the binding of SCAP to the resident ER protein INSIG. In contrast, when the ER membrane cholesterol content decreases, the SREBP·SACP complex binds to COPII proteins, which cluster the complex into transport vesicles that move to the Golgi where SREBPs are processed sequentially by two proteases, designated site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P). These cleavage steps release the mature forms of SREBPs that enter the nucleus and activate genes related to cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism (2Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar).Because SREBP-1 primarily regulates the transcription of genes related to fatty acid metabolism and SREBP-2 preferentially controls cholesterol metabolism, under certain circumstances these two proteins are distinctively activated through proteolytic cleavage in the ER and Golgi. The difference between SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 processing is observable in the liver of rats or mice refed after fasting. The amount of the nuclear active form of SREBP-1, predominantly SREBP-1c in the liver, increases enormously with the consumption of a high carbohydrate/low fat diet as compared with nonfasted levels, whereas the nuclear SREBP-2 protein levels remain unaltered (3Horton J.D.

Increased SREBP-1c processing is thought to be in part due to insulin effects after feeding. Insulin greatly suppresses the genetic expression of INSIG-2a, a predominant isoform of INSIG-2 active in the liver, but reciprocally augments INSIG-1 gene expression, thereby stimulating the ER to Golgi transport of the SREBP-1c·SCAP complex (5Yabe D. Komuro R. Liang G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3155-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although the INSIG-2a to INSIG-1 switch is thought to play a critical role in insulin-triggered SREBP-1c processing, the precise mechanism for the division of roles between the two INSIG family members remains unclear. A recent paper demonstrated that insulin-mediated phosphorylation of SREBP-1c enhances the association between the SREBP-1c·SCAP complex and COPII proteins, and subsequently, ER to Golgi transport and proteolytic cleavage (6Yellaturu C.R. Deng X. Cagen L.M. Wilcox H.G. Mansbach 2nd, C.M. Siddiqi S.A. Park E.A. Raghow R. Elam M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7518-7532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At the same time, changes in the levels of both SCAP and INSIG also play a crucial role in controlling SREBP processing. SCAP deficiency in the mouse liver results in severe reductions in SREBP processing and lipid synthesis (7Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Matsuda M. Korn B.S. Hammer R.E. Moon Y.A. Komuro R. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Shimomura I. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Overexpression of one of the INSIG family members, INSIG-1, in the liver also brings about parallel declines in SREBP processing and lipid synthesis (9Engelking L.J. Kuriyama H. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Liang G. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). On the other hand, INSIG-1/-2 double deficiency provokes a marked increase in SREBP-1 processing, but surprisingly not SREBP-2, or fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis (10Engelking L.J. Liang G. Hammer R.E. Takaishi K. Kuriyama H. Evers B.M. Li W.P. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2489-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This finding prompts us to speculate on the existence of an as yet unidentified regulatory factor other than INSIGs that determines the fate of the SREBP·SCAP complex by distinguishing between SREBP-1c and SREBP-2.TRC8 encoding an E3-ubiquitin ligase disrupted in a family with hereditary renal cell carcinoma is a putative tumor suppressor (11Gemmill R.M. West J.D. Boldog F. Tanaka N. Robinson L.J. Smith D.I. Li F. Drabkin H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9572-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Gemmill R.M. Bemis L.T.

TRC8 is thought to localize to the ER as a membrane-associated protein with multiple membrane spanning domains containing a putative SSD, and is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues (11Gemmill R.M. West J.D. Boldog F. Tanaka N. Robinson L.J. Smith D.I. Li F. Drabkin H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9572-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A previous paper (13Brauweiler A. Lorick K.L. Lee J.P. Tsai Y.C. Chan D. Weissman A.M. Drabkin H.A. Gemmill R.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2263-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of TRC8 suppressed genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, consistent with the notion that growth suppression induced by TRC8 is linked to reduced cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis required for cell growth. However, little is known concerning the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effect of TRC8 on lipid synthesis or the importance of its SSD. In the current investigation we confirmed that TRC8 suppresses SREBP processing, especially SREBP-2, and reduces the expression of SREBP target genes. Conversely, RNA interference-mediated depletion of endogenous TRC8 enhanced SREBP-2 processing and transcription of its target genes. Interaction between TRC8 and the SREBP-2·SCAP complex hindered the ER to Golgi transport of the complex through an inhibition of the binding of SCAP to a component of the COPII protein, Sec24. The TRC8 protein was rapidly degraded, whereas mutant TRC8 lacking its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was quite stable. TRC8 protein levels gradually increased after cells were cultured with a medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) instead of normal serum, suggesting that the SSD that senses a decline in lipoprotein supply determined its own turnover rate. Taken together, TRC8 is a novel sterol-sensing ER membrane protein in addition to SCAP and INSIGs, which are involved in SREBP processing.DISCUSSIONThe current study shows that TRC8, localized in the ER along with the SREBP·SCAP complex, functions as a novel inhibitory protein of SREBP processing. We obtained the following findings. 1) Overexpression of TRC8 suppresses the expression of SREBP target genes, including SQS and HMG-CoA synthase, by hindering SREBP-2 processing. 2) RNA interference-mediated depletion of endogenous TRC8 conversely enhances SREBP-2 target gene expression through an augmentation of SREBP-2 processing. 3) TRC8 interacts with both SREBP-2 and SCAP, thereby inhibiting the binding of SCAP to Sec24 and hampering the ER to Golgi transport of the SREBP·SCAP complex. 4) TRC8 is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and becomes stable under a lipoprotein-depleted condition. Thus, several lines of evidence show that INSIG-1 and -2 are exclusive regulatory membrane proteins that associate with the SREBP·SCAP complex and retain it in the ER in response to changes in the ER membrane cholesterol content (28Yang T.

Adams C.M. Rawson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16672-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Once the proteolytic processing of SREBP-2 is initiated under sterol-depleted conditions, this processing evidently continues until the SREBP·SCAP·INSIG complex is reconstituted in response to increased cholesterol synthesis. It is reasonable to assume that enhanced SREBP-2 processing is finally hindered by the TRC8 that accumulates under lipoprotein-depleted conditions to avoid prolonged overactivation of SREBP-2 in the absence of INSIG-mediated blockade of SREBP processing.In the liver of SCAP-null mice SREBPs are not processed without their escort protein and become unstable (7Rawson R.B.

It is possible that TRC8 might directly interact with SREBPs in the absence of SCAP, thereby enhancing degradation as a result of its E3 ligase activity. However, this does not seem to be the case, because there was no significant change in the level of precursor SREBPs when TRC8 was overexpressed or depleted by siRNA (Fig. 2). Indeed, ubiquitination of endogenous or exogenous SREBP-2 was not observed even when TRC8 was highly expressed in cultured cells (data not shown). It is, therefore, possible that TRC8 in the SCAP-deficient liver retains SREBPs in the ER and assists in their rapid turnover, although it remains unclear how SREBPs free of SCAP become unstable. Under physiological conditions, it has been estimated that the amount of SCAP is a rate-limiting step in SREBP·SCAP complex formation and that only 20–40% of the SREBP precursors are in the complex with SCAP (30Sakai J.

It seems likely that TRC8 might interact with the SREBPs free of SCAP. The preceding interaction between TRC8 and SREBPs might hinder formation of the SREBP·SCAP complex, thereby inhibiting exit from the ER and SREBP processing. This would account for the current findings that RNA interference-mediated depletion of endogenous TRC8 enhances SREBP-2 processing.The binding site of SCAP for Sec24 has been identified as a hexapeptide sequence, located in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane helices 6 and 7 (26Espenshade P.J.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the current study, we established a novel assay system to estimate the direct interaction between SCAP and Sec24 by means of the GST protein fused to this loop (GST-SCAP-Loop6). This assay revealed that TRC8 interfered with the association between Sec24 and the loop (Fig. 6). Because a direct interaction between TRC8 and the loop was not observed (supplemental Fig. S3), it is possible that TRC8 masked the binding site of Sec24 for the hexapeptide. Indeed, the TRC8 and Sec24 interaction was confirmed (Fig. 6), suggesting that TRC8 moves to the Golgi through the COPII protein-coated vesicles. Next we examined whether TRC8 binds Sec24 even after the SREBP·SCAP·TRC8 complex is formed. The interaction between TRC8 and Sec24 was inhibited by SREBP-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6). This demonstrates that the SREBP·SCAP·TRC8 complex tends to remain in the ER as the result of weakening of Sec24 binding to both SCAP and TRC8.It is noteworthy that TRC8 was determined to be one of the functional sterol-sensing proteins. TRC8 is rapidly degraded through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and becomes stable in the absence of lipoprotein in the culture medium. Another sterol-sensing protein, HMG-CoA reductase, is similarly degraded in response to an increase in intracellular sterols, especially lanosterol, which induces the formation of an HMG-CoA reductase·INSIG complex, including gp78 with its E3 ligase activity (32Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 33Song B.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol.

Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, therefore, requires two sequential steps, sterol-mediated INSIG binding and recruitment of gp78. On the other hand, TRC8 contains two functional domains, the SSD and RING finger domain, thereby controlling its own expression level by sensing the intracellular sterol levels without the need of any associated proteins. For as long as the examination was performed, the TRC8 protein was more rapidly degraded in the presence of lipoprotein, which is taken up by the cell surface low density lipoprotein receptors, rather than in the presence of the cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol supplemented in the culture medium. It is possible that lipoprotein-derived sterols are more accessible to TRC8 via the internalization pathway in the vicinity of the ER and Golgi, which probably leads to the conformational change and ubiquitination of TRC8, thereby accelerating protein turnover. The detailed molecular mechanism of lipoprotein-accelerated TRC8 degradation is now under investigation.We do not consider the major physiological function of TRC8 to be restricted to the regulation of SREBP processing, because this inhibitory effect does not require its RING domain. We attempted to identify as yet unknown TRC8-associated proteins using stable HEK293 cells expressing the FLAG-TRC8 established in the current study. Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies and mass spectrometry analyses revealed a highly specific cytoplasm protein, which was not precipitated with mutant TRC8 lacking the E3 ligase activity (MUT24 cells), and is unlikely to be related to cholesterol metabolism. This protein physically interacted with TRC8 when both proteins were exogenously expressed in culture cells. As long as the protein levels were exogenously elevated or reduced with siRNA, SREBP processing was not affected. 3M. Irisawa, J. Inoue, and R. Sato, unpublished observations. It will be of interest to determine whether this protein is related to a putative original function of TRC8 as a tumor suppresser. These findings indicate that the transmembrane region with the SSD and the C-terminal region with the RING domain of TRC8 independently interact with individual associated proteins and exert their respective functions. Further studies are now underway to verify the additional TRC8 biological functions.In conclusion, evidence is presented that TRC8 is a novel sterol-sensing ER membrane protein. This protein interacts with SREBP-2 and SCAP, thereby inhibiting the association between SCAP and Sec24, which drives the ER to Golgi translocation of the SREBP·SCAP complex via COPII protein-coated vesicles. TRC8 tends to hinder SREBP-2 processing rather than SREBP-1 processing, and affects the transcription of genes related to cholesterol metabolism. The molecular mechanism for this preferentiality should be determined in the near future. The inhibitory effect of TRC8 on cholesterol metabolism reflects its originally proposed function as a tumor suppressor, because tumor cells require large amounts of membrane cholesterol for their rapid growth.

The proteolytic processing of SREBPs is highly controlled by the interaction between two ER membrane proteins, SCAP and the insulin-inducing gene (INSIG). Once the ER membrane cholesterol content increases, SCAP binds cholesterol, thereby leading to a conformational change in the membrane domain, the so-called sterol-sensing domain (SSD). This domain resembles sequences in certain other proteins that are postulated to interact with sterols: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the Niemann-Pick C1 protein, and Patched (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the conformational change promotes the binding of SCAP to the resident ER protein INSIG. In contrast, when the ER membrane cholesterol content decreases, the SREBP·SACP complex binds to COPII proteins, which cluster the complex into transport vesicles that move to the Golgi where SREBPs are processed sequentially by two proteases, designated site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P). These cleavage steps release the mature forms of SREBPs that enter the nucleus and activate genes related to cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism (2Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). sterol regulatory element-binding protein N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal activating transcription factor 6 endoplasmic reticulum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase hemagglutinin 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A insulin-inducing gene lipoprotein-deficient serum placenta alkaline phosphatase site-1 protease site-2 protease SREBP-cleavage-activated protein squalene synthase sterol-sensing domain translocation in renal cancer from chromosome 8 small interfering RNA glutathione S-transferase human embryonic kidney fetal bovine serum. sterol regulatory element-binding protein N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal activating transcription factor 6 endoplasmic reticulum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase hemagglutinin 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A insulin-inducing gene lipoprotein-deficient serum placenta alkaline phosphatase site-1 protease site-2 protease SREBP-cleavage-activated protein squalene synthase sterol-sensing domain translocation in renal cancer from chromosome 8 small interfering RNA glutathione S-transferase human embryonic kidney fetal bovine serum. Because SREBP-1 primarily regulates the transcription of genes related to fatty acid metabolism and SREBP-2 preferentially controls cholesterol metabolism, under certain circumstances these two proteins are distinctively activated through proteolytic cleavage in the ER and Golgi. The difference between SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 processing is observable in the liver of rats or mice refed after fasting. The amount of the nuclear active form of SREBP-1, predominantly SREBP-1c in the liver, increases enormously with the consumption of a high carbohydrate/low fat diet as compared with nonfasted levels, whereas the nuclear SREBP-2 protein levels remain unaltered (3Horton J.D.

Increased SREBP-1c processing is thought to be in part due to insulin effects after feeding. Insulin greatly suppresses the genetic expression of INSIG-2a, a predominant isoform of INSIG-2 active in the liver, but reciprocally augments INSIG-1 gene expression, thereby stimulating the ER to Golgi transport of the SREBP-1c·SCAP complex (5Yabe D. Komuro R. Liang G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3155-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although the INSIG-2a to INSIG-1 switch is thought to play a critical role in insulin-triggered SREBP-1c processing, the precise mechanism for the division of roles between the two INSIG family members remains unclear. A recent paper demonstrated that insulin-mediated phosphorylation of SREBP-1c enhances the association between the SREBP-1c·SCAP complex and COPII proteins, and subsequently, ER to Golgi transport and proteolytic cleavage (6Yellaturu C.R. Deng X. Cagen L.M. Wilcox H.G. Mansbach 2nd, C.M. Siddiqi S.A. Park E.A. Raghow R. Elam M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7518-7532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At the same time, changes in the levels of both SCAP and INSIG also play a crucial role in controlling SREBP processing. SCAP deficiency in the mouse liver results in severe reductions in SREBP processing and lipid synthesis (7Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Matsuda M. Korn B.S. Hammer R.E. Moon Y.A. Komuro R. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Shimomura I. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Overexpression of one of the INSIG family members, INSIG-1, in the liver also brings about parallel declines in SREBP processing and lipid synthesis (9Engelking L.J. Kuriyama H. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Liang G. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). On the other hand, INSIG-1/-2 double deficiency provokes a marked increase in SREBP-1 processing, but surprisingly not SREBP-2, or fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis (10Engelking L.J. Liang G. Hammer R.E. Takaishi K. Kuriyama H. Evers B.M. Li W.P. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2489-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This finding prompts us to speculate on the existence of an as yet unidentified regulatory factor other than INSIGs that determines the fate of the SREBP·SCAP complex by distinguishing between SREBP-1c and SREBP-2. TRC8 encoding an E3-ubiquitin ligase disrupted in a family with hereditary renal cell carcinoma is a putative tumor suppressor (11Gemmill R.M. West J.D. Boldog F. Tanaka N. Robinson L.J. Smith D.I.

Hooper J.E. Drabkin H.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3507-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). TRC8 is thought to localize to the ER as a membrane-associated protein with multiple membrane spanning domains containing a putative SSD, and is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues (11Gemmill R.M. West J.D. Boldog F. Tanaka N. Robinson L.J. Smith D.I. Li F. Drabkin H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9572-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A previous paper (13Brauweiler A. Lorick K.L. Lee J.P. Tsai Y.C. Chan D. Weissman A.M. Drabkin H.A. Gemmill R.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2263-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of TRC8 suppressed genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, consistent with the notion that growth suppression induced by TRC8 is linked to reduced cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis required for cell growth. However, little is known concerning the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effect of TRC8 on lipid synthesis or the importance of its SSD. In the current investigation we confirmed that TRC8 suppresses SREBP processing, especially SREBP-2, and reduces the expression of SREBP target genes. Conversely, RNA interference-mediated depletion of endogenous TRC8 enhanced SREBP-2 processing and transcription of its target genes. Interaction between TRC8 and the SREBP-2·SCAP complex hindered the ER to Golgi transport of the complex through an inhibition of the binding of SCAP to a component of the COPII protein, Sec24. The TRC8 protein was rapidly degraded, whereas mutant TRC8 lacking its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was quite stable. TRC8 protein levels gradually increased after cells were cultured with a medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) instead of normal serum, suggesting that the SSD that senses a decline in lipoprotein supply determined its own turnover rate. Taken together, TRC8 is a novel sterol-sensing ER membrane protein in addition to SCAP and INSIGs, which are involved in SREBP processing. DISCUSSIONThe current study shows that TRC8, localized in the ER along with the SREBP·SCAP complex, functions as a novel inhibitory protein of SREBP processing. We obtained the following findings. 1) Overexpression of TRC8 suppresses the expression of SREBP target genes, including SQS and HMG-CoA synthase, by hindering SREBP-2 processing. 2) RNA interference-mediated depletion of endogenous TRC8 conversely enhances SREBP-2 target gene expression through an augmentation of SREBP-2 processing. 3) TRC8 interacts with both SREBP-2 and SCAP, thereby inhibiting the binding of SCAP to Sec24 and hampering the ER to Golgi transport of the SREBP·SCAP complex. 4) TRC8 is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and becomes stable under a lipoprotein-depleted condition. Thus, several lines of evidence show that INSIG-1 and -2 are exclusive regulatory membrane proteins that associate with the SREBP·SCAP complex and retain it in the ER in response to changes in the ER membrane cholesterol content (28Yang T.

Adams C.M. Rawson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16672-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Once the proteolytic processing of SREBP-2 is initiated under sterol-depleted conditions, this processing evidently continues until the SREBP·SCAP·INSIG complex is reconstituted in response to increased cholesterol synthesis. It is reasonable to assume that enhanced SREBP-2 processing is finally hindered by the TRC8 that accumulates under lipoprotein-depleted conditions to avoid prolonged overactivation of SREBP-2 in the absence of INSIG-mediated blockade of SREBP processing.In the liver of SCAP-null mice SREBPs are not processed without their escort protein and become unstable (7Rawson R.B.

Under physiological conditions, it has been estimated that the amount of SCAP is a rate-limiting step in SREBP·SCAP complex formation and that only 20–40% of the SREBP precursors are in the complex with SCAP (30Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It seems likely that TRC8 might interact with the SREBPs free of SCAP. The preceding interaction between TRC8 and SREBPs might hinder formation of the SREBP·SCAP complex, thereby inhibiting exit from the ER and SREBP processing. This would account for the current findings that RNA interference-mediated depletion of endogenous TRC8 enhances SREBP-2 processing. The binding site of SCAP for Sec24 has been identified as a hexapeptide sequence, located in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane helices 6 and 7 (26Espenshade P.J. Li W.P. Yabe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11694-11699Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 31Sun L.P. Seemann J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the current study, we established a novel assay system to estimate the direct interaction between SCAP and Sec24 by means of the GST protein fused to this loop (GST-SCAP-Loop6). This assay revealed that TRC8 interfered with the association between Sec24 and the loop (Fig. 6). Because a direct interaction between TRC8 and the loop was not observed (supplemental Fig. S3), it is possible that TRC8 masked the binding site of Sec24 for the hexapeptide. Indeed, the TRC8 and Sec24 interaction was confirmed (Fig. 6), suggesting that TRC8 moves to the Golgi through the COPII protein-coated vesicles. Next we examined whether TRC8 binds Sec24 even after the SREBP·SCAP·TRC8 complex is formed. The interaction between TRC8 and Sec24 was inhibited by SREBP-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6). This demonstrates that the SREBP·SCAP·TRC8 complex tends to remain in the ER as the result of weakening of Sec24 binding to both SCAP and TRC8. It is noteworthy that TRC8 was determined to be one of the functional sterol-sensing proteins. TRC8 is rapidly degraded through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and becomes stable in the absence of lipoprotein in the culture medium. Another sterol-sensing protein, HMG-CoA reductase, is similarly degraded in response to an increase in intracellular sterols, especially lanosterol, which induces the formation of an HMG-CoA reductase·INSIG complex, including gp78 with its E3 ligase activity (32Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 33Song B.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol.

Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, therefore, requires two sequential steps, sterol-mediated INSIG binding and recruitment of gp78. On the other hand, TRC8 contains two functional domains, the SSD and RING finger domain, thereby controlling its own expression level by sensing the intracellular sterol levels without the need of any associated proteins. For as long as the examination was performed, the TRC8 protein was more rapidly degraded in the presence of lipoprotein, which is taken up by the cell surface low density lipoprotein receptors, rather than in the presence of the cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol supplemented in the culture medium. It is possible that lipoprotein-derived sterols are more accessible to TRC8 via the internalization pathway in the vicinity of the ER and Golgi, which probably leads to the conformational change and ubiquitination of TRC8, thereby accelerating protein turnover. The detailed molecular mechanism of lipoprotein-accelerated TRC8 degradation is now under investigation. We do not consider the major physiological function of TRC8 to be restricted to the regulation of SREBP processing, because this inhibitory effect does not require its RING domain. We attempted to identify as yet unknown TRC8-associated proteins using stable HEK293 cells expressing the FLAG-TRC8 established in the current study. Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies and mass spectrometry analyses revealed a highly specific cytoplasm protein, which was not precipitated with mutant TRC8 lacking the E3 ligase activity (MUT24 cells), and is unlikely to be related to cholesterol metabolism. This protein physically interacted with TRC8 when both proteins were exogenously expressed in culture cells. As long as the protein levels were exogenously elevated or reduced with siRNA, SREBP processing was not affected. 3M. Irisawa, J. Inoue, and R. Sato, unpublished observations. It will be of interest to determine whether this protein is related to a putative original function of TRC8 as a tumor suppresser. These findings indicate that the transmembrane region with the SSD and the C-terminal region with the RING domain of TRC8 independently interact with individual associated proteins and exert their respective functions. Further studies are now underway to verify the additional TRC8 biological functions. In conclusion, evidence is presented that TRC8 is a novel sterol-sensing ER membrane protein. This protein interacts with SREBP-2 and SCAP, thereby inhibiting the association between SCAP and Sec24, which drives the ER to Golgi translocation of the SREBP·SCAP complex via COPII protein-coated vesicles. TRC8 tends to hinder SREBP-2 processing rather than SREBP-1 processing, and affects the transcription of genes related to cholesterol metabolism. The molecular mechanism for this preferentiality should be determined in the near future. The inhibitory effect of TRC8 on cholesterol metabolism reflects its originally proposed function as a tumor suppressor, because tumor cells require large amounts of membrane cholesterol for their rapid growth.

Here, we showed that the β2AR coupling to Gi proteins was agonist dose-dependent and occurred only at high concentrations in mouse cardiac myocytes. Both the β2AR-induced PKA activity, measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging, and the increase in myocyte contraction rate displayed sensitivity to the Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX). Further studies revealed that activated β2ARs underwent PKA phosphorylation at a broad range of agonist concentrations. Disruption of the PKA phosphorylation sites on the β2AR blocked receptor/Gi coupling. However, a sufficient β2AR/Gi coupling was also dependent on the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation of the receptors, which only occurred at high concentrations of agonist (≥100 nm). Disruption of the GRK phosphorylation sites on the β2AR blocked receptor internalization and coupling to Gi proteins, probably by preventing the receptor's transportation to access Gi proteins. Furthermore, neither PKA nor GRK site mutated receptors displayed sensitivity to the Gi-specific inhibitor, GiCT.

Both β1- and β2ARs are prototypical GPCRs expressed in animal hearts, which mediate the increases in cardiac contraction upon agonist stimulation through the Gs-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-dependent PKA pathway (1.Lefkowitz R.J. Acta Physiol. (Oxf.). 2007; 190: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). β2ARs are also known to uniquely couple to inhibitory Gi proteins, which inhibits adenylyl cyclases to reduce cardiac contraction and initiates anti-apoptotic and cell growth signaling (2.Singh K.

Although β2AR coupling to Gi has been studied in reconstituted systems and in fibroblasts (4.Asano T. Katada T. Gilman A.G. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Various studies indicate that phosphorylation of β2AR plays a critical role in regulating differential G protein coupling. The β2AR phosphorylation by PKA mediates the switch of coupling from Gs to Gi (6.Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 7.Zamah A.M. Delahunty M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31249-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), presumably operating in a feedback after receptor activation. Our previous studies have revealed that β2AR/Gi coupling is also dependent on receptor internalization and recycling (8.Wang Y. De Arcangelis V. Gao X. Ramani B. Jung Y.S. Xiang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1799-1807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9.Xiang Y. Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Kobilka B. J. Biol.

Meanwhile, Wang et al. have shown that direct inhibition of GRK2 prevents β2AR/Gi coupling in mouse cardiac myocytes (8.Wang Y. De Arcangelis V. Gao X. Ramani B. Jung Y.S. Xiang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1799-1807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), supporting a role of the β2AR phosphorylation by GRK in receptor/Gi coupling. Studies have also revealed that β2ARs are differentially phosphorylated by PKA and GRK in fibroblasts in an agonist dose-dependent manner (10.Hausdorff W.P. Lohse M.J. Bouvier M. Liggett S.B.

Although the PKA-mediated phosphorylation is sensitive to stimulation with subnanomolar concentrations, the GRK-mediated phosphorylation happens only when β2ARs are stimulated with saturated concentrations (10.Hausdorff W.P.

Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This differential regulation of receptor phosphorylation by different kinases and their effects on subsequent receptor trafficking indicate that the β2AR/Gi coupling may be finely regulated in an agonist concentration-dependent manner. Here, using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay with a biosensor for PKA activity and a physiological cardiac contraction rate assay, we show for the first time that β2AR/Gi coupling occurs only at a saturated concentration of isoproterenol (Iso) in cardiac cells. Stimulation induces the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2AR over a wide range of agonist concentrations, whereas the GRK-mediated phosphorylation occurs only at sufficiently high concentrations (≥100 nm) of Iso and is necessary for receptor internalization. We further demonstrate that mutations of the specific PKA or GRK phosphorylation sites on the β2AR abolish receptor coupling to Gi protein. Our data suggest that the PKA-mediated phosphorylation is necessary for β2AR/Gi coupling, but a sufficient receptor/Gi coupling is also dependent on the GRK-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent trafficking of the receptors. pcDNA3.1-FLAG-tagged murine β2AR was used as a template for mutagenesis. A protein kinase A mutant (PKAmut) β2AR lacking protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation sites (serines 261, 262, 345, and 346) was generated by replacing the four serines with alanines. A GRK mutant (GRKmut) β2AR lacking the GRK phosphorylation sites (serines 355, 356, and 358) was also created by replacing serines with alanine. These phosphorylation sites are determined by Tran et al. (13.Tran T.M. Friedman J. Qunaibi E. Baameur F. Moore R.H. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Both β2AR mutants were sequenced and transformed into adenovector for producing adenoviruses, as described previously (14.Wang Y. Lauffer B. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. Xiang Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The titers of the viruses were assessed by comparison of receptor expression levels with both Western blot and ligand binding, as described previously (15.Xiang Y. Kobilka B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10776-10781Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The GFP-GiCT virus used in contraction assays was a kind gift from Dr. Walter Koch (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Measurement of spontaneous myocyte contraction was performed as described previously (16.Devic E. Xiang Y. Gould D. Kobilka B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar). Neonatal cardiac myocytes were isolated from mice lacking either β1AR (β1AR-knock-out; β1AR- KO) or both β1 and β2AR genes (β1β2AR-KO). β1β2AR-KO myocytes were infected with murine β2AR, PKAmut β2AR, or GRKmut β2AR at a multiplicity of infection of 100 and stimulated with 10 μm Iso. Cardiac myocytes were treated with Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX) at 0.3 μg/ml, 3 h before stimulation. GFP-GiCT virus was co-infected at a multiplicity of infection of 100 or, as indicated, along with the wild type or mutant β2AR viruses. Contraction rate assays were performed the next day as described previously (16.Devic E. Xiang Y. Gould D. Kobilka B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 577-583PubMed Google Scholar). Neonatal cardiac myocytes were infected with FLAG-tagged wild type or mutant β2ARs at a multiplicity of infection of 100. After 48 h of expression, cells were serum-starved for 2 h and stimulated with different doses of Iso for 5 min. For the time course experiments, cells were stimulated with 10 μm Iso for different times as indicated. Cells were placed into lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific)) for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was resolved by SDS-PAGE for Western blotting. The β2AR phosphorylation by PKA at Ser(P)261/262 was detected with a monoclonal antibody from Dr. Richard Clark (University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX). The β2AR phosphorylation by GRK at Ser(P)355/356 was detected with a polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). IRDye 680CW goat anti-mouse and IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used to detect Ser(P)261/262 and Ser(P)355/356 phosphorylation, respectively. Western blots were visualized with an Odyssey scanner (Li-cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and quantified before normalization against the base-line levels. After expressing the FLAG-β2AR, the β1β2AR-KO myocytes were serum-starved for 2 h and stimulated with 10 nm or 10 μm Iso for different times. For receptor recycling, cells were stimulated with Iso for 10 min, rinsed, and refed with serum-free medium for different times. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-FLAG antibody, which was revealed with an Alexa-488 conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were taken with a CCD camera on a Zeiss microscope with Metamorph software. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the FLAG-β2AR, PKAmut β2AR, and GRKmut β2AR. Receptor internalization and recycling was quantified in HEK293 cells by using a fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA) to determine cell surface receptor levels as previously described (17.Swaminath G. Xiang Y. Lee T.W. Steenhuis J. Parnot C. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 686-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In brief, the FLAG-tagged receptors were labeled with anti-FLAG M1 antibody, which was revealed by the Alexa-488 goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody and detected by Spectramax M2 fluorometer. β1AR-KO or β1β2AR-KO cardiac myocytes were infected with virus expressing A-kinase activity reporter (AKAR2.2) as previously described (18.Soto D. De Arcangelis V. Zhang J. Xiang Y. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 770-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For β1β2AR-KO myocytes, cells were also infected with receptor virus for overnight expression. The procedure for PKA FRET activity was carried out as previously described (18.Soto D. De Arcangelis V. Zhang J. Xiang Y. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 770-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Curve fitting and statistical analyses were performed using Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA). By activation of the endogenous β2AR with Iso in β1AR- KO cardiac myocytes, we analyzed the receptor-induced PKA activity through a FRET assay using the fluorescent biosensor AKAR2.2. Activation of the β2AR with 10 nm Iso induced a transient peak in PKA activity, which returned to base-line levels within 5 min (Fig. 1A). Pretreatment with PTX, which specifically inhibits Gi proteins, did not significantly change the β2AR-induced FRET response. However, a saturated concentration of 10 μm Iso resulted in a more sustained PKA FRET response, which was further enhanced with PTX pretreatment (Fig. 1B). This finding indicates that 10 μm Iso, but not 10 nm Iso, selectively induces β2AR/Gi coupling for PKA activity in cardiac myocytes. We then used a cardiac contraction rate assay to examine the physiological consequences of this dose-dependent receptor/Gi protein coupling. We found that at 10 nm Iso, the β2AR-induced increase in contraction rate was not PTX-sensitive (Fig. 1C), whereas PTX significantly enhanced the increase in contraction rate induced by 10 μm Iso (Fig. 1D). These data again suggest that the β2AR couples to Gi proteins only after stimulation with high concentrations of agonist. Consistent with this notion, the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of phospholamban, a PKA substrate that is critical for the βAR-induced cardiac contractile response, was enhanced by PTX only after stimulation with 10 μm Iso (Fig. 1E). Previous reports have suggested that the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2AR enhances the receptor coupling to Gi protein (6.Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 7.Zamah A.M. Delahunty M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31249-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and the GRK-dependent phosphorylation of the β2AR occurs only after stimulation with high concentrations of agonist (13.Tran T.M. Friedman J. Qunaibi E. Baameur F. Moore R.H. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), making the phosphorylation of β2AR a potential regulator of this dose-dependent Gi coupling in cardiac myocytes. Analysis of the phosphorylation of β2AR in cardiac myocytes showed that the PKA-dependent phosphorylation at serines 261/262 occurred at subnanomolar concentrations of Iso and displayed a dose-dependent increase (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the β2AR phosphorylation by GRK at serines 355/356 occurred only at 100 nm Iso or at higher doses (Fig. 2, A and C). After stimulation with saturated 10 μm Iso, the kinetics of the GRK- and PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2AR differed (Fig. 2D). The PKA-mediated phosphorylation showed a rapid increase, followed by a slow decrease, whereas the GRK-mediated phosphorylation was slower but more sustained over time (Fig. 2, E and F). It has been well documented that the GRK-mediated phosphorylation is involved in the endocytosis of β2AR in fibroblasts (19.Vaughan D.J. Millman E.E. Godines V. Friedman J. Tran T.M. Dai W. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Moore R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7684-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20.Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), prompting us to explore the role of β2AR phosphorylation in receptor internalization in cardiac myocytes. The activated β2ARs showed little punctuate staining upon stimulation with 10 nm Iso in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 3A). However, stimulation with 10 μm Iso induced a time-dependent clustering of β2ARs in the cells, similar to those reported previously (8.Wang Y. De Arcangelis V. Gao X. Ramani B. Jung Y.S. Xiang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1799-1807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which is a characteristic of receptor internalization (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the removal of Iso after 10 min of stimulation allowed the internalized receptor to return to the cell surface (Fig. 3A). These observations were further confirmed by quantification with a FLISA assay (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Stimulation of the β2AR induces agonist dose-dependent internalization in cardiac myocytes. A, the β1β2AR-KO cardiac myocytes expressing FLAG-β2AR were stimulated with 10 nm or 10 μm Iso for 10 or 30 min or 10-min Iso stimulation followed by drug removal for 30 or 60 min. The FLAG-β2ARs were visualized through immunofluorescence imaging. These data are representative of at least three experiments. B, the cell surface FLAG-β2ARs were quantified by FLISA in HEK293 cells after stimulation up to 10 or 30 min or after 10 min Iso stimulation followed by drug removal for 30 or 60 min. Receptor levels were normalized against base-line levels (n = 5). **, p < 0.01 by Student's t test. Con, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then directly tested the role of phosphorylation in receptor internalization and signaling by using mutant β2ARs with the PKA or GRK phosphorylation sites replaced by alanines. The expressions of both PKAmut and GRKmut were quantified and equalized through Western blot and ligand binding (supplemental Fig. S1). Western blots of the mutant β2ARs also confirmed abolishment of the specific receptor phosphorylation events upon stimulation with 10 μm Iso (supplemental Fig. S2). Immunostaining of the wild type and PKAmut β2ARs showed time-dependent internalization of the receptors after stimulation with 10 μm Iso (Fig. 4A). However, the GRKmut β2ARs failed to sufficiently internalize under Iso stimulation. Washout of Iso after 10 min of stimulation showed that the internalized receptors underwent recycling to the cell surface (Fig. 4B). Quantification through the FLISA assay confirmed that the wild type and PKAmut β2ARs but not the GRKmut β2ARs were significantly internalized upon 10 min of stimulation with 10 μm Iso (Fig. 4C), supporting the necessary role of GRK phosphorylation in the internalization of the β2AR in cardiac myocytes. Together, the characterization of the mutant β2ARs revealed distinct actions of PKA and GRK on the receptor phosphorylation and trafficking in cardiac myocytes upon agonist stimulation, deeming the phosphorylation-deficient mutants suitable for closer examination on the effects on the receptor signaling in these cells. By introducing either wild type or mutant β2AR into β1β2AR-KO cardiac myocytes, we were able to examine the physiological effects of the phosphorylation of the β2AR upon receptor activation. Stimulation of the PKAmut β2AR induced a stronger contraction rate increase over that of the wild type (Fig. 5A). Stimulation of the GRKmut β2AR showed a contraction rate increase similar to that of the wild type, but this increase was much more sustained (Fig. 5A). Although the base-line contraction rates between the wild type and mutant β2ARs were not significantly different (Fig. 5B), the maximal contraction rate increase induced by the PKAmut β2AR was significantly higher than that of wild type (Fig. 5C). These data strongly suggest that the phosphorylation of the β2AR has significant consequences in regulating myocyte contraction rate responses. By analyzing PKA activity in cardiac myocytes induced by these mutant β2ARs, we were able to observe the kinetics of upstream signaling, which leads to contraction induced by the receptors. Stimulation of the wild type, PKAmut β2AR, or GRKmut β2AR with 10 μm Iso induced a stronger FRET increase in PKA activity, although the increase induced by the GRKmut β2AR was less than those of the wild type and PKAmut receptors (Fig. 6A). Inhibition of Gi proteins with PTX pretreatment significantly enhanced the PKA FRET increase induced by activation of the wild type β2AR (Fig. 6B). However, the FRET response induced by the PKAmut β2AR was insensitive to PTX (Fig. 6C), indicating that this receptor was unable to couple to Gi protein. Interestingly, the FRET response induced by the GRKmut β2AR was also PTX-insensitive (Fig. 6D), indicating that the GRK-dependent phosphorylation was necessary for β2AR coupling to Gi protein. Extending the PKA FRET results into the contraction rate assay reinforced the physiological effects of this phosphorylation-dependent G protein-coupling phenomenon. Although pretreatment with PTX significantly enhanced the wild type β2AR-induced increase in contraction rate upon stimulation with 10 μm Iso (Fig. 7, A and E), it did not significantly affect the PKAmut β2AR-induced increase in contraction rate (Fig. 7, B and E). Moreover, PTX did not enhance the GRKmut β2AR-induced increase in contraction rate; instead, it lowered the contraction rate increase (Fig. 7, C and E), which could be in part due to the enhanced base-line contraction rate by PTX treatment (Fig. 7D). These data suggest that both PKA and GRK phosphorylation are required for β2AR coupling to Gi protein, which thereafter affects myocyte contraction rate response. We further employed a specific inhibitor of the Gi protein consisting of the C-terminal portion of Gαi2 (GiCT) (21.DeGeorge Jr., B.R. Gao E. Boucher M. Vinge L.E. Martini J.S. Raake P.W. Chuprun J.K. Harris D.M. Kim G.W. Soltys S. Eckhart A.D. Koch W.J. Circulation. 2008; 117: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) to probe receptor/Gi coupling by either wild type or mutant β2AR. We first determined that infection with GiCT virus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 optimally inhibited receptor/Gi coupling and enhanced the β2AR-induced increase in contraction rate (Fig. 8A). We then introduced GiCT along with wild type or mutant β2AR into β1β2AR-KO cardiac myocytes. Overexpressing GiCT significantly enhanced the wild type β2AR-induced increase in contraction rate (Fig. 8, B and F), which was similar to that obtained with PTX treatment. However, GiCT did not affect the PKAmut β2AR-induced increase in contraction rate (Fig. 8, C and F). Similar to that of PTX treatment (Fig. 7C), inhibition of Gi protein with GiCT also reduced the GRKmut β2AR-induced increase in contraction rate (Fig. 8, D and F). Overexpression of GiCT did not affect the base-line contraction rates (Fig. 8E). Together, we showed that inhibition of Gi with GiCT significantly enhanced the maximal contraction rate induced by the wild type but not by the PKAmut and GRKmut β2ARs. By measuring PKA activity and cardiac contraction rate increase, we show for the first time that β2AR activation of Gi proteins occurs selectively at high concentrations but not at low concentrations of agonist. Moreover, we show that the receptor coupling to Gi proteins is differentially regulated by the PKA- and GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the activated β2ARs. At both low and high concentrations of agonist, the activated β2ARs undergo the PKA-mediated phosphorylation. In comparison, only high concentrations of agonist induce the GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the β2ARs for subsequent internalization, which is also necessary for sufficient receptor coupling to Gi proteins (8.Wang Y.

Our studies link together various components of the β2AR, including receptor phosphorylation, receptor trafficking, and differential receptor/G protein coupling in cardiac cells, which may allow the activation of the β2AR signaling pathway to function as either a stimulatory or protective mechanism for cardiac cells under different levels of stress. It has been well documented that the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of β2AR enhances the receptor coupling affinity to Gi protein in a reconstituted system, and mutation of the PKA phosphorylation sites blocks receptor coupling to Gi in HEK293 fibroblasts (6.Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 7.Zamah A.M. Delahunty M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31249-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this study, we have further resolved the necessity of the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of β2AR in coupling to Gi proteins in cardiac myocytes. Activation of the murine β2AR by both low and high concentration of isoproterenol leads to phosphorylation of the receptor by PKA. At high concentrations of isoproterenol, the phosphorylation levels of the β2AR by PKA are further enhanced in comparison with those at low concentrations. This is probably due to dissociation of phosphodiesterase 4D isoforms from the activated receptors (data not shown), which leads to higher local PKA activity for receptor phosphorylation. However, under stimulation with low concentrations of isoproterenol, the activated β2ARs do not couple to Gi, even if the PKA-mediated phosphorylation occurs (Figs. 1 and 2). However, disruption of the PKA phosphorylation sites on the β2AR with mutagenesis blocks the receptor coupling to Gi (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8). Together, these data indicate that PKA phosphorylation is necessary but not sufficient for the activated β2AR coupling to Gi in cardiac myocytes. In contrast, the β2ARs undergo GRK-dependent phosphorylation only under stimulation with high concentrations of Iso (Fig. 2). Disruption of the GRK sites prolongs the Iso-induced myocyte contraction rate response (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with the notion that the phosphorylation of β2AR by GRK is required for rapid receptor desensitization (22.Premont R.T. Gainetdinov R.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 511-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We do not observe obvious change in the overall PKA activity induced by the GRKmut (Fig. 6A), probably because the change is small and occurs in the local environment of the receptor and thus is not sensed by PKA probes presented throughout the cytosol. However, similar to those of the PKAmut, the PKA FRET and contraction rate responses induced by the GRKmut β2AR do not show sensitivity to the inhibition of Gi protein (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8), indicating that the GRK-mediated phosphorylation is required for sufficient coupling to Gi. One possibility is that the GRK-phosphorylated receptors undergo internalization to promote the access of the receptor to Gi protein. Another possibility is that the GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the β2AR directly enhances the binding affinity of the receptor to Gi protein. However, evidence so far argues that the GRK phosphorylation-dependent receptor trafficking is more likely the key for sufficient receptor/Gi coupling. To support this notion, either blocking receptor internalization or disrupting receptor recycling through point mutation on the PDZ motif of the β2AR blocks the receptor/Gi coupling, which yields enhanced myocyte contraction responses (9.Xiang Y. Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34280-34286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 15.Xiang Y. Kobilka B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10776-10781Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, Wang et al. (8.Wang Y. De Arcangelis V. Gao X. Ramani B. Jung Y.S. Xiang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1799-1807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have shown that direct inhibition of GRK2 activity blocks the receptor coupling to Gi proteins in myocytes. Furthermore, the GRK phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of arrestin-PDE4D complexes to the activated β2AR has been implicated in receptor/Gi coupling (23.Baillie G.S. Sood A. McPhee I. Gall I. Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Houslay M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These studies, together with our data, suggest that the GRK-mediated phosphorylation of β2AR and subsequent receptor trafficking are critical for sufficient access of the receptor to Gi proteins. Consistent with this notion, a Gi-specific inhibitor, GiCT, selectively blocks the receptor coupling to Gi without affecting the receptor coupling to Gs. These data suggest that the GiCT peptide did not compete against the unphosphorylated receptors in binding to Gs protein but blocks the phosphorylated receptor in binding to Gi protein, which reinforces the idea that β2AR/Gi coupling is dependent on the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the receptor. Together, our data suggest that although the PKA-mediated phosphorylation is required for high affinity binding to Gi protein, the GRK-mediated phosphorylation is necessary for receptor trafficking that appears to control the accessibility of β2AR to Gi protein in cardiac myocytes. Cardiac contraction in response to adrenergic stimulation is a tightly controlled process to ensure steady increases in cardiac output without overstimulation. Our observation of an agonist concentration-dependent switch of the activated β2AR coupling from Gs and Gi may be critical for such fine regulation. At low concentrations of catecholamines, the activated receptors will couple only to Gs for a stimulatory effect on cAMP/PKA activities for increasing cardiac contraction. However, in the presence of high concentrations of catecholamines, the activated β2ARs will switch from Gs to Gi to reduce cAMP/PKA activities in cardiac tissues while preventing the overstimulation of cardiac contraction. The mechanism for how high concentrations of agonists can induce receptor phosphorylation by different kinases for subsequent switch of G protein coupling is currently not known. Structural studies reveal that higher concentrations of agonists induce conformational changes distinct from those induced by low concentrations (17.Swaminath G. Xiang Y. Lee T.W. Steenhuis J. Parnot C. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 686-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), which may enhance the receptor binding affinity to GRK. Alternatively, low concentrations may selectively activate the Gs protein-precoupled pool of receptors with high affinity binding, whereas higher concentrations of agonists activate both precoupled and non-coupled pools of receptors. The latter pool of receptors may be involved in coupling to Gi proteins. The mechanism thus remains to be addressed. This protective mechanism by receptor/Gi coupling may be essential for preventing a high frequency of contractions, such as fibrillation during stress. In addition, β2AR/Gi coupling can play a protective role against the apoptotic effects induced by adrenergic/Gs stimulation (24.Chesley A. Lundberg M.S. Asai T. Xiao R.P. Ohtani S. Lakatta E.G.

More than a simple extension of the biochemical characterization of the β2AR, this study provides insightful information on the physiological effects of receptor phosphorylation by PKA and GRK. More importantly, it opens up questions about the nature of phosphorylation and its role in receptor desensitization, a concept that has been established in the last couple of decades. Undoubtedly, phosphorylation seems to play a role in diminishing the effects of receptor activation in cardiac myocytes, since abolishing those phosphorylation sites enhanced the contraction rate over the wild type upon stimulation (Fig. 4). However, we find that receptor phosphorylation appears to be critical in regulating contraction through coupling to different G proteins to protect cardiac cells from overwhelming agonist stimulation. Our study provides a clear step toward understanding the nature of receptor regulation by PKA- and GRK-mediated phosphorylation in a physiological context.

https://openalex.org/W2005525058,"Memory formation in the brain is thought to be depending upon long lasting plastic changes of synaptic contacts that require alterations on the transcriptional level. Here, we characterize LAPSER1, a putative cytokinetic tumor suppressor that binds directly to ProSAP2/Shank3 and the synaptic Rap-Gap protein SPAR1 as a novel postsynaptic density component. Postsynaptic LAPSER1 is in complex with all important members of the canonical Wnt pathway including beta-catenin. Upon N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent activation, LAPSER1 and beta-catenin comigrate from the postsynaptic density to the nucleus and induce the transcription and translation of known beta-catenin target genes, including Tcfe2a and c-Myc. The nuclear export and cytoplasmic redistribution of beta-catenin is tightly regulated by LAPSER1. We postulate a postsynaptic cross-talk between N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and a LAPSER1-beta-catenin complex that results in a self-regulated, synaptic activity-dependent expression of beta-catenin target genes. This calls for a novel role of Tcfe2a and c-Myc in plastic changes of neural tissue."

The FA proteins and the familial breast cancer susceptibility gene products, BRCA1 and FANCD1/BRCA2, function cooperatively in the FA-BRCA pathway to repair damaged DNA and to prevent cellular transformation. Activation of this pathway occurs via the mono-ubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein, targeting it to nuclear foci where it co-localizes with FANCD1/BRCA2, RAD51, and PCNA. The regulation of the mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2, as well as its function in DNA repair remain poorly understood. In this study, we have further characterized the interaction between the FANCD2 and PCNA proteins. We have identified a highly conserved, putative FANCD2 PCNA interaction motif (PIP-box), and demonstrate that mutation of this motif disrupts FANCD2-PCNA binding and precludes the mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2. Consequently, the FANCD2 PIP-box mutant protein fails to correct the mitomycin C hypersensitivity of FA-D2 patient cells.

FANCD2 and PCNA co-localize in nuclear foci following treatment with agents that inhibit DNA replication. Like FANCD2, PCNA is mono-ubiquitinated following exposure to DNA-damaging agents (16Hoege C.

The functional significance of the FANCD2-PCNA interaction, however, has not been determined. In addition to its role as a DNA polymerase processivity factor, PCNA interacts with many DNA repair proteins, e.g. MSH3, XPG, and p21Cip1/Waf1 (22Moldovan G.L. Pfander B. Jentsch S. Cell. 2007; 129: 665-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). These interactions typically occur in a hydrophobic pocket of the PCNA homotrimer, termed the interdomain connecting loop (ICL). Proteins that interact with the PCNA ICL harbor a highly conserved PCNA-binding motif called the PIP-box, defined by the amino acid sequence QXXhXXaa, where h represents amino acids with moderately hydrophobic side chains, e.g. leucine, isoleucine, or methionine (L, I, M), a represents amino acids with highly hydrophobic, aromatic side chains, e.g. phenylalanine and tyrosine (F, Y), and X is any amino acid (23Warbrick E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Here, we describe an important functional interaction between FANCD2 and PCNA. We have identified a highly conserved putative PIP-box in FANCD2, and demonstrate that mutation of this motif disrupts the FANCD2-PCNA interaction, and precludes both the spontaneous and DNA damage-inducible mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2. Consequently, the FANCD2 PIP-box mutant fails to correct the MMC hypersensitivity of FA-D2 patient-derived cells. However, the mutant protein retains the ability to localize to chromatin, interact with FANCE, and undergo DNA damage-inducible phosphorylation. Our results suggest that PCNA may act as a molecular platform for the mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and for the activation of the FA-BRCA pathway.

The GST pull-down experiments were performed as previously described (25Guo C. Sonoda E. Tang T.S. Parker J.L. Bielen A.B. Takeda S. Ulrich H.D. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and whole-cell lysates were incubated with 10 μg of recombinant GST-Empty or GST-PCNA for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins were resolved using NuPAGE 3–8% (w/v) Tris-acetate or 4–12% (w/v) Bis-Tris (MOPS) gels (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antisera against FANCD2 (NB100–182, Novus Biologicals), PCNA (FL-261; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG (F7425; Sigma), and histone H2A (acidic patch) (07-146, Millipore), and mouse monoclonal sera against DNA polymerase δ catalytic subunit (610972; BD Biosciences), FANCD2 (FI-17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PCNA (PC10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-tubulin (MS-581-PO, Neomarkers), and V5 (Invitrogen). Images were analyzed, and band intensities quantified using ImageJ. Cells were lysed in modified λ phosphatase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Brij 35, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors, with sonication for 10 s. Approximately 10 units of λ phosphatase per μg of protein were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, prior to loading. Cells were grown in 15-cm2 dishes, incubated in the absence or presence of 120 nm MMC for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested in S1 hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Nuclear soluble proteins (S2 fraction) were extracted with a high-salt buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, plus protease inhibitors). To enrich for chromatin-associated proteins, salt-extracted pellets were treated with 3 units/μl of micrococcal nuclease for 20 min at room temperature in nuclease reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitors). FANCD2 immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (3Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol.

Statistical analysis of total chromosome gaps and breaks data were carried out using the Student's t-test for equal or unequal variance. Variance for each data set was determined using the sample variance F-test. Cells were X-irradiated using a Philips 250 orthovoltage unit at ∼2 Gy/min in the Irradiation Core of the University of Michigan Cancer Center. Using immunoprecipitation approaches, we sought to expand upon previous findings of an association between FANCD2 and PCNA in DNA damage-inducible nuclear foci (4Howlett N.G. Taniguchi T. Durkin S.G.

First, whole-cell lysates were prepared from HeLa cells stably expressing HA-tagged PCNA, untransfected or transiently transfected with a positive control FLAG-tagged p21 construct. HA-PCNA co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-p21 as well as both non- and mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2 (Fig. 1A). Next, we generated a FA-D2 (FANCD2-null) patient cell line stably expressing 6xHis/V5-tagged FANCD2 (Fig. 1B). Expression of 6xHis/V5-FANCD2 rescued the MMC hypersensitivity of these cells (results not shown). Using a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid pull-down approach, endogenous PCNA co-immunoprecipitated with 6xHis/V5-FANCD2 from these cells (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lane 3). To analyze the interaction between endogenous FANCD2 and PCNA in chromatin, HCT116 cells were irradiated with 40 J/m2 UV-C, fractionated in low and high salt lysis buffers, and sonicated briefly to release chromatin-bound proteins (24Xia B. Sheng Q. Nakanishi K. Ohashi A. Wu J. Christ N. Liu X. Jasin M. Couch F.J. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). We observed an enrichment for mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2 in the sonicated high salt cellular fraction, as expected (27Montes de Oca R. Andreassen P.R. Margossian S.P. Gregory R.C. Taniguchi T. Wang X. Houghtaling S. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2005; 105: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C, upper panel, lanes 3 and 6). A mouse monoclonal anti-PCNA antibody, but not mouse IgG, exclusively co-immunoprecipitated FANCD2 from both high salt fractions (Fig. 1C, middle panel, lanes 5 and 6). The specificity of the anti-PCNA mouse monoclonal antibody for PCNA immune complexes was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-PCNA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1C, lower panel). In a reciprocal approach, a rabbit polyclonal anti-FANCD2 antibody, but not rabbit serum, preferentially immunoprecipitated PCNA from chromatin fractions prepared from untreated and UV-irradiated HCT116 cells (supplemental Fig. S1, lower panel, lanes 3 and 4). In support of a direct interaction between FANCD2 and PCNA, GST-PCNA, and not GST alone, bound to 6xHis/V5-FANCD2 overexpressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 6 and 8). For this experiment, COS-7 cells overexpressing FLAG-p21 was used as a positive control (Fig. 1D, lane 8). We identified two putative PIP-box motifs in FANCD2: one at amino acids 527–534 and a second at amino acids 1063–1070. The PIP-box at amino acids 527–534 demonstrated high conservation and was selected for further analysis. The four essential FANCD2 PIP527–534-box amino acids were mutated to alanines (Fig. 2A), and the pMMP-FANCD2 PIPΔ retroviral vector generated. PD20F (FA-D2) patient cells were transduced with pMMP-FANCD2 PIPΔ, to generate the PD20F pMMP-FANCD2 PIPΔ cell line. To analyze the effect of mutation of the FANCD2 PIP-box on the FANCD2-PCNA interaction, PCNA immune complexes were immunoprecipitated from PD20F pMMP-Empty, -FANCD2 wt, -FANCD2 K561R (that cannot be mono-ubiquitinated) (3Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), and -FANCD2 PIPΔ cells, and immunoblotted with anti-FANCD2. As expected, FANCD2 wt readily co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA (Fig. 2B). FANCD2 K561R also co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA, albeit less efficiently (∼3-fold reduction) than FANCD2 wt (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2A). Finally, negligible levels of FANCD2 PIPΔ co- immunoprecipitated with PCNA (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2A). Immunoblotting with a rabbit polyclonal anti-PCNA antibody confirmed the presence of equal amounts of PCNA immune complexes in all four cell lines (Fig. 2B). Next, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 6xHis/V5-FANCD2 wt, -FANCD2 K561R, and -FANCD2 PIPΔ mammalian expression constructs. Similar to that observed above, 6xHis/V5-FANCD2 wt co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA (Fig. 2C). 6xHis/V5-FANCD2 K561R also co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA, although again less efficiently than 6xHis/V5-FANCD2 wt (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S2B). Finally, negligible levels of 6xHis/V5-FANCD2 PIPΔ co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA (Fig. 2C). When corrected for total 6xHis/V5-FANCD2 PIPΔ protein levels, this corresponded to an approximate 9-fold reduction in association between PCNA and 6xHis/V5-FANCD2 PIPΔ, compared with 6xHis/V5-FANCD2 wt (supplemental Fig. S2B). The FANCE protein has been proposed to form a molecular bridge between the core FA complex and FANCD2, and has been demonstrated to bind directly to FANCD2 (28Pace P. Johnson M. Tan W.M. Mosedale G. Sng C. Hoatlin M. de Winter J. Joenje H. Gergely F. Patel K.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3414-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of mutation of the FANCD2 PIP-box on the FANCD2-FANCE interaction, we transiently transfected PD20F pMMP-Empty, -FANCD2 wt, -FANCD2 K561R, and -FANCD2 PIPΔ cells with a FLAG-tagged FANCE construct, and examined the association between FANCD2 and FLAG-FANCE (Fig. 2D). The use of an epitope-tagged FANCE construct was required for this experiment because of the absence of a suitable commercially available FANCE antibody. When normalized for total FANCD2 protein levels, approximately equal amounts of FANCD2 wt, FANCD2 K561R, and FANCD2 PIPΔ co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-FANCE, indicating that the FANCD2 PIPΔ mutant protein retains the ability to associate with FANCE (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S2C). We also sought to determine if mutation of the FANCD2 PIP-box disrupted the interaction between FANCD2 and FANCI. However, we were unable to co-immunoprecipitate FANCD2 wt and FANCI, precluding us from addressing this question. Collectively, these results suggest that the interaction between FANCD2 and PCNA is mediated by a putative FANCD2 PIP-box that is dispensable for FANCD2-FANCE binding. Next, we examined the effects of mutation of the FANCD2 PIP-box on FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination. PD20F pMMP-Empty, -FANCD2 wt, -FANCD2 K561R, and -FANCD2 PIPΔ cells were exposed to 1.0 μm APH for 24 h, 60 J/m2 UV irradiation, or 15 Gy X-irradiation. Strong induction of wt FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination was observed for all treatments. For example, exposure to 1.0 μm APH for 24 h increased the FANCD2-Ub:FANCD2 ratio ∼2-fold (Fig. 3A). However, like FANCD2 K561R, the FANCD2 PIP-box mutant protein failed to undergo both spontaneous or DNA damage-inducible mono-ubiquitination (Fig. 3, A–C). Conversely, UV-inducible PCNA mono-ubiquitination was observed for all cell lines (Fig. 3B). We next examined the ability of the FANCD2 PIP-box mutant to undergo UV-inducible, ATR-mediated phosphorylation (13Andreassen P.R. D'Andrea A.D. Taniguchi T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1958-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 29Ho G.P. Margossian S. Taniguchi T. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7005-7015Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Whole-cell lysates prepared from untreated and UV-irradiated PD20F pMMP-FANCD2 wt and -FANCD2 PIPΔ cells were incubated in the absence or presence of λ phosphatase. As expected, λ phosphatase treatment accelerated the migration of FANCD2 wt (Fig. 3D, lanes 1–4). Similarly, λ phosphatase treatment accelerated the migration of both untreated and UV-irradiated FANCD2 PIPΔ (Fig. 3D, lanes 5–8). Collectively, these results indicate that the FANCD2 PIP-box mutant fails to undergo both spontaneous and DNA damage-inducible mono-ubiquitination, yet remains competent for ATR-mediated phosphorylation. We next examined the subcellular localization of the FANCD2 PIPΔ mutant protein. Cells were lysed in a hypotonic buffer to extract cytoplasmic proteins (S1). The remaining pellets were lysed in a high-salt buffer to extract soluble nuclear proteins (S2). Salt-extracted pellets were subsequently treated with micrococcal nuclease to release chromatin-associated proteins, characterized by the presence of the nucleosomal histone H2A (S3) (30Mosedale G. Niedzwiedz W. Alpi A. Perrina F. Pereira-Leal J.B. Johnson M. Langevin F. Pace P. Patel K.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We detected mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2 in the S2 and S3 fractions, in the absence and presence of MMC, as expected (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lanes 9–12). However, we also detected both non-ubiquitinated FANCD2 K561R and FANCD2 PIPΔ in all three fractions, in the absence and presence of MMC (Fig. 4A), indicating that the FANCD2 PIPΔ mutant protein remains competent for chromatin localization. A similar observation has previously been described for FANCD2 K561R (31Alpi A. Langevin F. Mosedale G. Machida Y.J. Dutta A. Patel K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8421-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We next examined the ability of the FANCD2 PIP-box mutant protein to assemble into discrete nuclear foci. Following exposure to APH, FANCD2 wt formed discrete nuclear foci as previously reported (3Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 4Howlett N.G. Taniguchi T. Durkin S.G. D'Andrea A.D. Glover T.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). However, like FANCD2 K561R (3Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), FANCD2 PIPΔ failed to form nuclear foci in the absence or presence of APH. Instead, we consistently observed non-punctate staining patterns, including diffuse nuclear as well as concentrated nucleolar staining (Fig. 4B). We next determined the protein half-lives of FANCD2-Ub, FANCD2 wt, FANCD2 K561R, and FANCD2 PIPΔ. Cells were exposed to the translation inhibitor cycloheximide and protein levels monitored over a 24 h period. FANCD2 K561R and FANCD2 PIPΔ exhibited significantly shorter half-lives than both FANCD2-Ub and FANCD2 wt. For example, 3 h following exposure to cycloheximide FANCD2 wt, K561R, and PIPΔ protein levels had decreased by ∼23, 38, and 81%, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, wild-type FANCD2-Ub protein levels increased ∼28%, and remained elevated 24 h following the addition of cycloheximide. These results indicate that the mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 promotes its stabilization in chromatin, and that mutation of Lys-561 and the PIP-box significantly reduces the protein half-life. We next determined if the FANCD2 PIPΔ mutant could rescue the MMC hypersensitivity of PD20F cells. In contrast to FANCD2 wt, the FANCD2 PIPΔ mutant failed to rescue the MMC sensitivity of PD20F cells. For example, at 60 nm MMC, a 2.4-fold increase in sensitivity (p < 0.05) to the lethal effects of MMC was observed for PD20F pMMP-FANCD2 PIPΔ cells compared with PD20F pMMP-FANCD2 wt cells (Fig. 6A). We also measured the frequency of chromosome gaps, breaks, and radial formations in metaphase spreads prepared from cells treated with APH or MMC. As expected, exposure to APH and MMC induced significantly elevated levels of chromosome aberrations in PD20F pMMP-Empty cells, 6.2-fold (p < 0.0001) and 2.1-fold (p = 0.0093), respectively, compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6B). Expression of FANCD2 wt corrected the elevated APH- (p = 0.0315) and MMC- (p = 0.001) induced chromosome aberrations of PD20F cells. However, expression of either FANCD2 K561R or FANCD2 PIPΔ failed to correct the elevated frequency of APH- and MMC-induced chromosome aberrations. Like PD20F pMMP-Empty, a 6.0-fold (p < 0.0001) and 2.4-fold (p = 0.0026) increase in chromosome aberrations was observed for PD20F pMMP-FANCD2 PIPΔ cells following treatment with APH and MMC, respectively, compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6B). Finally, using flow cytometry, we examined cell cycle progression in the absence or presence of MMC. Like PD20F pMMP-Empty and -FANCD2 K561R cells, PD20F pMMP-FANCD2 PIPΔ cells displayed a prolonged accumulation in G2 phase of the cell cycle following exposure to MMC. For example, a ∼2-fold greater proportion of PD20F pMMP-FANCD2 PIPΔ cells accumulated in G2/M following exposure to MMC, compared with PD20F pMMP-FANCD2 wt cells (Fig. 6C). Collectively these results strongly suggest that the FANCD2 PIP-box is essential for the function of FANCD2 in the cellular DNA damage response. In support of an important role for the FA-BRCA pathway in a S-phase DNA repair process, both spontaneous and DNA crosslink-induced FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination and nuclear foci formation occur almost exclusively during S-phase (9Taniguchi T. Garcia-Higuera I. Andreassen P.R. Gregory R.C. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2002; 100: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 32Akkari Y.M. Bateman R.L. Reifsteck C.A. Olson S.B.

Thus, it is likely that a stalled or collapsed DNA replication fork is a major stimulus for the mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2. The mechanism by which FANCD2 is recruited to damaged DNA replication forks has not, however, been determined. Here, we describe an important interaction between the FANCD2 and PCNA proteins. We demonstrate that FANCD2 and PCNA associate in chromatin, and that this association is dependent on a highly conserved FANCD2 PIP-box motif. Furthermore, disruption of this motif abrogates both spontaneous and DNA damage-inducible FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination. Our results suggest that the association between PCNA and FANCD2 may be an important prerequisite for the mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and, consequently, its DNA repair function. A similar auxiliary role for PCNA, also mediated via PIP-box interactions, has been established for several DNA repair enzymes including MSH3, XPG, and XPV/Pol η (34Acharya N. Yoon J.H. Gali H.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The association of FANCD2 with PCNA in a DNA damage surveillance capacity represents an attractive model for the localization of FANCD2 to sites of DNA damage encountered by the DNA replisome. That the mutation of the FANCD2 PIP-box completely abrogated both spontaneous and DNA damage-inducible FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination was unexpected. To our knowledge, only one other FANCD2 mutation, that of the site of ubiquitin conjugation itself, Lys-561, has been described that leads to a complete loss of FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination (3Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). We could not rule out the possibility that a change in protein folding underlies the inability of the FANCD2 PIP-box mutant to undergo mono-ubiquitination, as the PIP-box is proximal to Lys-561 (3Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Thus, a localized alteration in protein folding may preclude access of the FA E2/E3 holoenzyme to Lys-561. Several lines of evidence, however, argue against a gross structural alteration. First, like FANCD2 wt, the FANCD2 PIPΔ mutant retained the ability to interact with FANCE, a core FA complex protein previously demonstrated to bind directly to FANCD2 (28Pace P. Johnson M. Tan W.M. Mosedale G. Sng C. Hoatlin M. de Winter J. Joenje H. Gergely F. Patel K.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3414-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Second, the FANCD2 PIPΔ mutant protein underwent DNA damage-inducible phosphorylation (13Andreassen P.R. D'Andrea A.D. Taniguchi T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1958-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 29Ho G.P. Margossian S. Taniguchi T. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7005-7015Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Third, the FANCD2 PIPΔ mutant protein localized to chromatin. These results suggest that the mutant protein retains structural integrity and at least partial functionality. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility of a localized effect, or that mutation of the PIP-box precludes the interaction of FANCD2 with a protein, other than PCNA, required for its efficient mono-ubiquitination. The mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 has previously been hypothesized to be required for its targeting to chromatin (27Montes de Oca R. Andreassen P.R. Margossian S.P. Gregory R.C. Taniguchi T. Wang X. Houghtaling S. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2005; 105: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, in this study, albeit using a different subcellular fractionation protocol, we detected non-ubiquitinated FANCD2 K561R and FANCD2 PIPΔ proteins in chromatin. We propose that mono-ubiquitination stabilizes FANCD2 in chromatin, and that non-ubiquitinated FANCD2 fails to be retained in chromatin. In support of a chromatin-dependent FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination model, the FANCD2 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2T (38Machida Y.J. Machida Y. Chen Y. Gurtan A.M. Kupfer G.M. D'Andrea A.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 589-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) has been demonstrated to be constitutively chromatin-localized, independent of DNA damage or cell cycle stage (31Alpi A. Langevin F. Mosedale G. Machida Y.J. Dutta A. Patel K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8421-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the FA core complex localizes to chromatin, and its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is dependent on its DNA damage-induced chromatin localization (31Alpi A. Langevin F. Mosedale G. Machida Y.J. Dutta A. Patel K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8421-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 39Mi J. Kupfer G.M. Blood. 2005; 105: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that the association between FANCD2 and PCNA may facilitate the FA E2/E3 holoenzyme-mediated mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2, and its stabilization and retention in chromatin until USP1-mediated de-ubiquitination and chromatin release (40Oestergaard V.H. Langevin F. Kuiken H.J. Pace P. Niedzwiedz W. Simpson L.J. Ohzeki M. Takata M. Sale J.E. Patel K.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 798-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we have also demonstrated that mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2 displays a longer protein half-life than FANCD2 K561R and, in particular, FANCD2 PIPΔ. Mono-ubiquitin may serve as a molecular adaptor between PCNA-associated FANCD2 and an as yet unidentified ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD)-containing chromatin-associated protein. In support of this hypothesis, Matsushita et al. (41Matsushita N. Kitao H. Ishiai M. Nagashima N. Hirano S. Okawa K. Ohta T. Yu D.S. McHugh P.J. Hickson I.D. Venkitaraman A.R. Kurumizaka H. Takata M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 841-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a chicken DT40 FANCD2-Ub chimeric protein harboring an I44A mutation in the essential hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin (that disrupts ubiquitin-UBD binding) could only weakly complement the cisplatin sensitivity of fancd2 cells. Several candidate chromatin-associated ubiquitin receptors exist, including XPV/Pol η, REV1, or one of the core FA complex proteins. An important FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination-independent function for the FA core complex in REV1-mediated TLS has been demonstrated (11Mirchandani K.D. McCaffrey R.M. D'Andrea A.D. DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 902-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar): FANCA and FANCG, yet not FANCD2, were demonstrated to be required for the efficient assembly of the REV1 protein into nuclear foci (11Mirchandani K.D. McCaffrey R.M. D'Andrea A.D. DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 902-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has recently been proposed that the mono-ubiquitination of PCNA may be required for a post-replicative DNA repair process, for example daughter-strand gap (DSG) repair (12Niedzwiedz W. Mosedale G.

As DSG repair is thought to involve both TLS and a HR-mediated template switching process (12Niedzwiedz W. Mosedale G. Johnson M. Ong C.Y. Pace P. Patel K.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 43Nagaraju G. Scully R. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 1018-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we propose a model whereby FANCD2 and PCNA, through a mono-ubiquitination-dependent process, may function in the HR repair of DSGs (Fig. 7). This is consistent with several studies indicating a role for the FA proteins in an undefined HR process, as well as earlier observations that the major HR proteins BRCA1, FANCD1/BRCA2, and RAD51, co-localize with PCNA and FANCD2 in nuclear foci during S-phase (44Chen J. Silver D.P. Walpita D. Cantor S.B. Gazdar A.F. Tomlinson G. Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Scully R. Mol.

In summary, our findings strongly suggest that the FANCD2 protein associates with PCNA in a DNA damage surveillance capacity via a highly conserved PIP-box. Upon encounter of a lesion-damaged template during DNA replication, PCNA-associated FANCD2 becomes mono-ubiquitinated via the concerted activity of the core FA complex, the FANCL ubiquitin ligase, and the UBE2T E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, thus facilitating its function in DNA repair. The erroneous or untimely repair of damaged DNA replication forks could lead to the generation of the complex, unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities frequently observed in FA cancer cells. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the DNA damage surveillance and repair mechanisms activated upon DNA replication fork arrest, and lend further insight into the molecular etiology of a rare, yet highly important, cancer susceptibility syndrome.

N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (MGAT5) mediates beta1,6GlcNAc-branching by transferring N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to N-glycan substrates produced by the sequential action of Golgi alpha1,2-mannosidase I (MIa,b,c), MGAT1, alpha1,2-mannosidase II (MII, IIx), and MGAT2. Here we report that TCR signaling enhances mRNA levels of MIa,b,c and MII,IIx in parallel with MGAT5, whereas limiting levels of MGAT1 and MGAT2. Blocking the increase in MI or MII enzyme activity induced by TCR signaling with deoxymannojirimycin or swainsonine, respectively, limits beta1,6GlcNAc-branching, suggesting that enhanced MI and MII activity are both required for this phenotype. MGAT1 and MGAT2 have an approximately 250- and approximately 20-fold higher affinity for UDP-GlcNAc than MGAT5, respectively, and increasing MGAT1 expression paradoxically inhibits beta1,6GlcNAc branching by limiting UDP-GlcNAc supply to MGAT5, suggesting that restricted changes in MGAT1 and MGAT2 mRNA levels in TCR-stimulated cells serves to enhance availability of UDP-GlcNAc to MGAT5. Together, these data suggest that TCR signaling differentially regulates multiple N-glycan-processing enzymes at the mRNA level to cooperatively promote beta1,6GlcNAc branching, and by extension, CTLA-4 surface expression, T cell growth arrest, and self-tolerance."

We examine the emphases that major US and UK funding agencies place on particular modes of research practice and suggest that funding agency guidelines should be informed by a more dynamic and multidimensional account of scientific practice. Successful scientific practice encompasses broader and more varied modes of investigation than can be captured by focusing on hypothesis-driven research. We examine the emphases that major US and UK funding agencies place on particular modes of research practice and suggest that funding agency guidelines should be informed by a more dynamic and multidimensional account of scientific practice. Philosophy is often regarded as abstract and irrelevant to practical concerns. Yet, when it comes to decisions about funding science, philosophical conceptions of good scientific methodology have major implications for research policy. A number of scientists and philosophers have argued that the best science is hypothesis driven and that science's pivotal activity is to test hypotheses. From this perspective, descriptive, exploratory, and inductive methodologies, although sometimes necessary, are fundamentally preparatory. They are seen as valuable primarily to the extent that they fuel hypothesis-driven science. Despite this common view, a great deal of evidence indicates that it may be misleading. Examples from physics, chemistry, and biology suggest that accounts of scientific activity should involve not only the proposal and testing of hypotheses, but also the exploration of phenomena, the development of technology and techniques, and the generation of questions that can be addressed with inductive, model-building approaches (Glass and Hall, 2008Glass D.J. Hall N. Cell. 2008; 134: 378-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Kell and Oliver, 2004Kell D.B. Oliver S.G. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, Caldin, 2002Caldin E.F. Int. J. Phil. Chem. 2002; 8: 103-121Google Scholar). This wider viewpoint sees the primary output of science as its ability to intervene in and understand the natural world. Producing and testing hypotheses are important but insufficient strategies for achieving these aims. We maintain that an adequate theoretical account of how science works will need to subordinate the generation and testing of hypotheses to a far more inclusive range of practices, and that one of the most crucial arenas in which this widening of perspective must occur is in the funding of science. Although we believe that inspiration, effort, community structure, and intellectual rewards are of deep importance to scientific progress, from a practical viewpoint in today's research environment, almost all scientific inquiry requires official funding of some sort. Because funding agencies use philosophical conceptions of good scientific methodology to guide funding decisions, philosophy affects the progress of science. It is therefore important that funding philosophies reflect the complete body of strategies used to achieve scientific ends. Here, we consider how our claims about the nature of scientific practice relate—and should relate—to policy statements about the practice of research and to funding agency guidelines for grant applications. To do this, we focus on statements from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the US and the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) in the UK. We examine how these statements depict both hypothesis-driven and more exploratory, question-driven, or technology-oriented modes of investigation. We conclude that developing a more complete representation of the iterative, interdisciplinary, and multidimensional relationships between various modes of scientific investigation could improve funding agency guidelines. It is standard for scientists, philosophers, and other commentators on scientific practice to claim that hypothesis testing lies at the very heart of scientific practice and that it is, in fact, the singular activity that demarcates it from nonscientific activities (Popper, 1963Popper K.R. Conjectures and Refutations. Routledge and Kegan Paul, London1963Google Scholar). From a historical point of view, observers of science know this is problematic. The concept of the hypothesis and the popularity of hypothesis-driven modes of research have been in flux throughout the history of science (Laudan, 1981Laudan L. Science and Hypothesis: Historical Essays on Scientific Methodology. D. Reidel, Dordrecht1981Crossref Google Scholar). The familiar representation of science as hypothesis driven is typically based on situations in which very specific questions can be addressed within tightly bounded spheres of inquiry. Because such testing is upheld as an idealization of scientific practice, broader inquiries may often be framed post-hoc as narrower hypothesis testing (Glass, 2006Glass D.J. Experimental Design for Biologists. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2006Google Scholar). Other modes of practice, however, are at least as prevalent in less artificially narrowed contexts of inquiry. They frequently include different combinations of technology development, question-driven inquiry, and exploration of phenomena. The early development of the microscope, for example, revealed an invisible world that was then studied extensively in ways that led to entirely new understandings of life and of roles for technology in scientific investigation (Wilson, 1995Wilson C. The Invisible World: Early Modern Philosophy and the Invention of the Microscope. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1995Google Scholar). Hypothesis testing played only a minor role in this revolution, which involved exploratory investigation of regularities among microscopic phenomena. Again, general questions and the exploration of new technologies, rather than strict hypotheses, have propelled the development of chemistry throughout its history (Caldin, 2002Caldin E.F. Int. J. Phil. Chem. 2002; 8: 103-121Google Scholar). In biology, despite the efforts of some commentators to reconstruct all of Charles Darwin's work as hypothesis testing (Ayala, 2009Ayala F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 10033-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it is clear that Darwin spent over two decades identifying regularities in several biological domains and codifying the phenomena to be explained in the Origin (Hodge, 1983Hodge M.J.S. The development of Darwin's general biological theorizing.in: Bendall D.S. Evolution from Molecules to Men. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1983: 43-62Google Scholar). Similarly, in contemporary molecular biology, the accumulation of high-throughput data and technology-driven developments point to the importance of a diversity of non-hypothesis-driven practices (e.g., Brent, 2000Brent R. Cell. 2000; 100: 169-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, Aebersold et al., 2000Aebersold R. Hood L.E. Watts J.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 359Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Franklin, 2005Franklin L. Philos. Sci. 2005; 72: 888-899Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This broader range of practices involves open-ended and nonlinear approaches to specified—but sometimes vague and open—questions, problems, and ranges of phenomena. Inquiries tend to ramify as successive investigations produce partial answers that modify the original aim of inquiry, tighten its focus, and give rise to additional lines of research. Although such practices are broadly exploratory in nature, without pre-ordained endpoints, they are not necessarily preliminary or unfocused. Question-driven inquiry is often highly rigorous, and it occurs throughout many stages of investigation, often yielding an expansion of the domain of inquiry (Glass, 2006Glass D.J. Experimental Design for Biologists. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2006Google Scholar). Exploratory work frequently involves systematic variation of precisely defined parameters. It commonly focuses on ascertaining regularities or on individuating and characterizing previously unknown or neglected entities and processes (Steinle, 1997Steinle F. Philos. Sci. 1997; 64: S65-S74Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Franklin, 2005Franklin L. Philos. Sci. 2005; 72: 888-899Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Technology-oriented modes of investigation encompass the development of entirely new instruments and techniques, the modification or application of old ones in new contexts, and the transformation of biological phenomena into new technologies. Frequently, these modes of scientific practice combine with the reconfiguration or replacement of conceptual frameworks. The discoveries that microRNAs contribute to eukaryotic gene regulation and that proteorhodopsin is present in marine bacteria serve as illuminating examples of such conceptual shifts and of how various modes of practice work in combination over time. Unlike hypothesis-driven science, these broader practices are often not discipline bound, due to their inherent tendencies to step outside the boundaries of current technologies, theories, and community alliances. But despite the major differences between hypothesis-driven and broader modes of investigation, they are not dichotomous or mutually exclusive categories of practice. Hypothesis testing can be conceived of as specific and refined questioning that works best in appropriately narrowed contexts of inquiry. Typically, question-driven or exploratory work is required to generate the detailed understanding and background knowledge associated with such contexts. Most scientific inquiry will, therefore, consist of a range of investigative modes, including hypothesis testing, in repeated interplay with one another. This iterative interaction is arguably the engine of science and the characteristic that marks it as a special form of human inquiry. Biologists may not need sophisticated philosophical accounts of the connections between these practices in order to do science successfully. But it is important to understand how these modes of investigation and their dynamic relationships are reflected in the philosophies of scientific practice that guide funding agencies (Wilkins, 2001Wilkins A.S. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Frank Gannon recently published a parody of peer review in which two referees urge rejection of a fictional funding application by Charles Darwin. They criticize the proposed research for lacking an analysis of societal impact and also express concern about “the lack of a clear hypothesis to guide the enormous research task you propose: you could end up wasting your time and our money in an open-ended fishing exercise” (Gannon, 2009Gannon F. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar)."

Participants diagnosed to have hypertension were examined for target organ involvement. Hypertensive target organ damage was defined as the detection of any of the following: left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed by electrocardiogram, reduction in glomerular filtration rate, the presence of hypertensive retinopathy or a history of a stroke.Of the 219 hypertensive participants examined, 104 (47.5%) had evidence of target organ damage. The presence of target organ damage was associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. The odds of developing hypertensive target organ damage was five to six times higher in participants with blood pressure (BP) > or = 180/110 mmHg compared to those with BP < 140/90 mmHg, and there was a trend to higher odds of target organ damage with increasing BP (p = 0.001). Women had about lower odds of developing target organ damage compared to men.The high prevalence of target organ damage in this working population associated with increasing blood pressure, emphasises the need for hypertension control programs aimed at improving the detection of hypertension, and importantly addressing the issues inhibiting the effective treatment and control of people with hypertension in the population."

Using chromosome microdissection/hybrid selection approach we recently isolated a candidate oncogene CHD1L from 1q21 region. Our previous study has demonstrated that CHD1L had strong oncogenic ability, which could be effectively suppressed by siRNA against CHD1L. The molecular mechanism of CHD1L in tumorigenesis has been associated with its role in promoting cell proliferation. Methodology/Principal Findings To further investigate the in vivo oncogenic role of CHD1L, CHD1L ubiquitous-expression transgenic mouse model was generated. Spontaneous tumor formations were found in 10/41 (24.4%) transgenic mice, including 4 HCCs, but not in their 39 wild-type littermates. In addition, alcohol intoxication was used to induce hepatocyte pathological lesions and results found that overexpression of CHD1L in hepatocytes could promote tumor susceptibility in CHD1L-transgenic mice. To address the mechanism of CHD1L in promoting cell proliferation, DNA content between CHD1L-transgenic and wildtype mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) was compared by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry results found that CHD1L could facilitate DNA synthesis and G1/S transition through the up-regulation of Cyclin A, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, CDK2, and CDK4, and down-regulation of Rb, p27Kip1, and p53. Conclusion/Significance Taken together, our data strongly support that CHD1L is a novel oncogene and plays an important role in HCC pathogenesis"
https://openalex.org/W1965822637,"The ppGpp molecule is part of a highly conserved regulatory system for mediating the growth response to various environmental conditions. This mechanism may represent a common strategy whereby pathogens such as Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, regulate the virulence gene programs required for invasion, survival and persistence within host cells to match the capacity for growth. The products of the relA and spoT genes carry out ppGpp synthesis. To investigate the role of ppGpp on growth, protein synthesis, gene expression and virulence, we constructed a ΔrelA ΔspoT Y. pestis mutant. The mutant was no longer able to synthesize ppGpp in response to amino acid or carbon starvation, as expected. We also found that it exhibited several novel phenotypes, including a reduced growth rate and autoaggregation at 26°C. In addition, there was a reduction in the level of secretion of key virulence proteins and the mutant was>1,000-fold less virulent than its wild-type parent strain. Mice vaccinated subcutaneously (s.c.) with 2.5×104 CFU of the ΔrelA ΔspoT mutant developed high anti-Y. pestis serum IgG titers, were completely protected against s.c. challenge with 1.5×105 CFU of virulent Y. pestis and partially protected (60% survival) against pulmonary challenge with 2.0×104 CFU of virulent Y. pestis. Our results indicate that ppGpp represents an important virulence determinant in Y. pestis and the ΔrelA ΔspoT mutant strain is a promising vaccine candidate to provide protection against plague."

Recently, GCC185 was proposed to localize to the Golgi by the co-operation of two small GTPases, Rab6A/A' and Arl1 (Burguete et al., 2008Burguete A.S. Fenn T.D. Brunger A.T. Pfeffer S.R.

Polyubiquitination of monoUb-PCNA was further enhanced by interactions between the N-terminal domain of Rad5 and PCNA. Thus, Rad5 acts both to align monoUb-PCNA with Ub-charged Ubc13 and to stimulate Ub transfer onto Lys63 of a Ub acceptor. We also found that Rad5 interacts with PCNA independently of the number of monoubiquitinated subunits in the trimer and that it binds to both unmodified and monoUb-PCNA with similar affinities.

Cell. 2007; 129: 665-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). At the replication fork, DNA is encircled by PCNA, a homotrimeric protein that promotes processive movement of the replicative DNA polymerase. Upon DNA damage and subsequent stalling of the replicative polymerase, Ub modifications of PCNA signal DDT, which allows a cell to bypass the lesion and proceed past this potential block in replication (2Torres-Ramos C.A.

Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the DDT pathway, as in other Ub-dependent pathways, Ub is conjugated to a substrate by the actions of three enzymes, an E1 activating enzyme, an E2 conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ligase (5Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). The E1 enzyme initiates the pathway in a two-step reaction that utilizes ATP hydrolysis to activate the C terminus of Ub, culminating in the formation of an E1∼Ub thiolester. Subsequent transthiolation to the active site cysteine of the E2 generates an E2∼Ub thiolester. An E3 ligase then brings a substrate into close proximity to the E2∼Ub intermediate, thereby catalyzing the formation of an isopeptide bond between the amino group of a substrate lysine and the C-terminal glycine of Ub. Polyubiquitination occurs when this substrate is another Ub, either free or as part of a Ub-protein conjugate. The DDT pathway is characterized by distinct ubiquitination events on PCNA that occur in two stages (3Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S.

Ubc13 is a canonical E2 enzyme with an active site cysteine that receives activated Ub by transthiolation from the E1∼Ub complex (12Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M.

This Ub is referred to as the “donor Ub.” Mms2 is a Ub E2 variant protein that lacks the active site cysteine (12Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M.

The positioning of the acceptor Ub by Mms2 controls the specificity of polyUb assembly such that only Lys63-linked chains can be formed (16Eddins M.J. Carlile C.M. Gomez K.M. Pickart C.M.

Ubc13-Mms2 can synthesize Lys63-linked chains in vitro in the absence of a PCNA substrate or an E3 ligase (12Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M.

However, unlike the synthesis of free Lys63-linked polyUb chains by Ubc13-Mms2, little is known about the polyubiquitination of PCNA or the role of the Rad5 E3 ligase in these reactions. Rad5 can bind PCNA and Rad18, and it contains a catalytic RING domain that characterizes the largest class of E3 ligases (17Johnson R.E. Henderson S.T. Petes T.D. Prakash S. Bankmann M. Prakash L.

There is evidence that RING E3s like Rad5 may play a more active role in ubiquitination than simply bringing the substrate into close proximity with the E2∼Ub. Several RING E3s have been shown to stimulate the synthesis of unanchored polyUb chains or autoubiquitination of their cognate E2s in the absence of substrates (22Scaglione K.M. Bansal P.K.

This stimulation may be related to the ability of RING E3s to enhance reactivity of the E2∼Ub thiolester bond through allosteric effects (25Ozkan E. Yu H. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18890-18895Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 1107-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Using purified recombinant forms of Ubc13, Mms2, and Rad5, we have explored the assembly of free Lys63-linked polyUb chains as well as the extension of a polyUb chain on a synthetic analog of monoUb-PCNA. We show that Rad5 facilitates ubiquitination in part by increasing the reactivity of the Ubc13∼Ub thiolester bond. With monoUb-PCNA substrates, Rad5 also stimulated polyubiquitination through direct interactions with PCNA and recruitment of Ub-charged Ubc13-Mms2. Surprisingly, Rad5 recognition of monoUb-PCNA appeared to depend on interactions only with the PCNA moiety of the conjugate, which suggests that substrate selectivity in vivo is likely to depend on additional factors. The RAD5 gene coding sequence was PCR-amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and cloned into pFastBacDual (Invitrogen) with either a H6 or FLAG N-terminal tag. The I916A mutation was introduced into pFastBacDual (FLAG-Rad5) by standard PCR methods. The yeast Ub gene was modified and cloned into the pET3a vector (Novagen) to make pET3a (H6Ub(G76C)). All of the inserts were sequenced at the Johns Hopkins Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility. pET11a (FLAG-PCNA(C22A,C30A,C62A,C81A,K164C)) was a gift from Todd Washington (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Insect cell expression and purification of murine H6-E1, and bacterial expression and purification of Ub, Ub(K63R), Ub-D77, Ubc13, Ubc13(N79A), Ubc13(N79Q), and Mms2 have been described (12Hofmann R.M.

H6-Rad5, FLAG-Rad5, and FLAG-Rad5(I916A) were expressed in Sf21 insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system (Invitrogen). H6-Rad5-containing Sf21 cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% Triton X-100. Clarified lysate was loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column, and bound proteins were washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. H6-Rad5 was eluted in wash buffer supplemented with 200 mm imidazole. H6-Rad5 was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superose 6; GE Healthcare) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. FLAG-Rad5 and FLAG-Rad5(I916A)-expressing insect cells were lysed similarly, and proteins were bound to anti-FLAG resin (M2 antibody agarose; Sigma), eluted with 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide, and further purified by gel filtration as above. H6-Ub(G76C)-expressing bacterial cells were lysed as with recombinant wild-type Ub (27Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), except that 1 mm TCEP (Sigma) was added to the lysis buffer. The protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described above. Anti-polyhistidine antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-FLAG M2 antibodies were from Sigma. BL21(DE3) cells expressing FLAG-PCNA(C22A,C30A,C62A,C81A,K164C) (hereafter referred to as FLAG-PCNA) were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme. DNA was digested upon addition of 10 mm MgCl2 and 20 μg/ml DNase I. Clarified lysate was applied to a 30-ml Mono Q column equilibrated in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm TCEP) plus 200 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were washed with the same buffer and then eluted with 500 mm NaCl in Buffer A. The PCNA-containing fractions were diluted to 150 mm NaCl, loaded onto a 6-ml Resource Q column, and eluted using a 40-column volume linear gradient from 200–500 mm NaCl in Buffer A. FLAG-PCNA eluted at ∼400 mm NaCl and was ∼95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Rad5ΔN (amino acids 500–1169) was a gift from Michael Eddins (Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes), RFC was a gift from Manju Hingorani (Wesleyan University), and Ub-GFP was available from a previous study. Doubly biotinylated template DNA and primer DNA were as described (31Haracska L. Unk I. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6477-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Synthesis followed the general strategy of Yin et al. (30Yin L. Krantz B. Russell N.S. Deshpande S. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10001-10010Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). FLAG-PCNA (∼0.35 mm) and H6-Ub(G76C) (1 mm) were incubated on ice in 0.2 m sodium borate, pH 8.6, and 2 mm TCEP. 1,3-Dichloroacetone was added to 0.35 mm. After 1 h, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The coupling of FLAG-PCNA to H6-Ub(G76C) was 60–70% efficient and produced differentially modified PCNA trimers; these trimers were visualized by native gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide). H6-Ub(G76C) and coupled H6-Ub(G76C) dimers were removed by gel filtration (Superdex 200; GE Healthcare) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl. The mixed monoUbn*-PCNA species (where n corresponds to the number of subunits in the trimer that are coupled to Ub) were loaded onto a 1-ml HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare), and bound proteins were eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient of imidazole (5–200 mm). (H6-Ub(G76C))1PCNA eluted at ∼40 mm imidazole, (H6-Ub(G76C))2 PCNA eluted between 40 and 120 mm imidazole, and (H6-Ub(G76C))3 PCNA eluted after 100 mm imidazole. 1 nmol of FLAG-PCNA or FLAG-PCNA–(H6-Ub(G76))3 was immobilized on anti-FLAG M2 agarose and incubated with 1 nmol of H6-Rad5 for 1 h at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl. The resin was collected and washed twice in the same buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by incubation with 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide. The proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE and detected by a Western blot using anti-FLAG or anti-polyhistidine antibody. The reactions contained 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 25 μm [α-32P]ATP, 0.05 μm E1, and 0.1 μm Ubc13-Mms2 complex with or without 0.05 μm Rad5. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP, and after incubation at 30 °C, the products were resolved by thin layer chromatography (polyethyleneimine cellulose F; Merck) developed with 0.5 mm LiCl in 0.5 m formic acid and detected with a PhosphorImager. E2 thiolester assays were conducted as described (28Wu P.Y. Hanlon M. Eddins M. Tsui C. Rogers R.S. Jensen J.P. Matunis M.J. Weissman A.M. Wolberger C. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5241-5250Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with 8 μm Ubc13-Mms2, 20 μm 125I-Ub(K63R), and 0.1 μm E1 with or without 2 μm Rad5. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to terminate the reactions. After SDS-PAGE, the Ub-thiolester adduct was detected by autoradiography and quantified by γ-counting. Reactions in which Ubc13 was precharged with 125I-Ub(K63R) were done similarly except that, after charging, E1 activity was stopped by the addition of 1 unit of apyrase (Sigma) to deplete ATP (25Ozkan E. Yu H. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18890-18895Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); Rad5 was then added, and the 125I-labeled thiolester products were measured as described above. All of the conjugation reactions were at 37 °C and pH 7.6. In qualitative chain assembly assays, equal concentrations (117 μm) of acceptor Ub (Ub-D77) and donor Ub (Ub(K63R)) were used; by this means, conjugation was terminated at diubiquitin (Ub2). The reactions also contained 0.1 μm H6-E1, 2 μm Ubc13-Mms2, and 2 μm Rad5 (wild-type or I916A mutant). The Ub2 product was visualized by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. polyUb synthesis assays were done similarly but used 234 μm Ub. In chain extension assays, 20 μm H6-PCNA (wild-type) or monoUb3*-PCNA and 117 μm Ub(K63R) were incubated under similar conditions. To determine the stoichiometry of the functional (Ubc13-Mms2)-Rad5 complex, increasing amounts of Rad5 were added to 0.4 μm Ubc13-Mms2 and incubated for 5 min. To quantify Ub2 production, 125I-Ub(K63R) was used. Ub2 was resolved using SDS-PAGE, and after staining with Coomassie Blue the 125I-Ub2 bands were excised and counted in a γ-counter (13Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, kinetic assays were conducted similarly using 2 μm Ubc13-Mms2 with or without 2 μm Rad5. The reactions were monitored to determine the initial rates of Ub conjugation at various Ub-D77 or monoUb3*-PCNA concentrations. The measurements were done in triplicate. Loading assays were conducted as published (31Haracska L. Unk I. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6477-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), except that monoUb3*-PCNA was loaded onto the biotinylated DNA. Ubiquitination reactions were as described above. RING E3 ligases, such as Rad5, are generally thought to support ubiquitination by bringing together a Ub-charged E2, and the substrate. Ubc13-Mms2 can synthesize free polyUb chains in vitro, so we could examine the effects of Rad5 on free chain synthesis to see whether this E3 contributes to Ub conjugation in the absence of the monoUb-PCNA substrate. The addition of Rad5 to free chain assembly assays stimulated the rate of chain synthesis by Ubc13-Mms2 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3 versus lanes 4–6). This effect depended on the Rad5 RING domain, because there was no stimulation with a mutated form of Rad5, Rad5(I916A), in which the RING domain binding site for Ubc13-Mms2 was disrupted (lanes 7–9). It was previously shown that mutation of Ile916, which is conserved among many RING E3s, abrogates E2 binding, thereby inactivating the ligase function (20Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To facilitate more quantitative analysis, we limited chain assembly to diubiquitin formation by use of Ub-D77, which can serve only as a Ub acceptor, and Ub(K63R), which can serve only as a Ub donor. As in reactions containing wild-type Ub, Rad5 stimulated the formation of Ub2 by Ubc13-Mms2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3 versus lanes 4–6). No stimulation was observed with Rad5(I916A), again indicating that stimulation depends on the RING domain (lanes 7–9). polyUb chains were not formed when reactions contained only Ub(K63R), confirming that chains were linked specifically through Lys63 (lanes 10–12). To estimate the stoichiometry of the active complex, Rad5 was titrated into Ub2 synthesis reactions that contained a fixed concentration of Ubc13-Mms2 complex (0.4 μm). Maximal stimulation occurred when Rad5 was approximately equimolar with Ubc13-Mms2, indicating that the functional enzyme complex is a heterotrimer consisting of one Rad5 molecule and one Ubc13-Mms2 heterodimer (Fig. 1C). Rad5 interacts with the E3 ligase Rad18, which is initially required to monoubiquitinate PCNA. The significance of this E3-E3 interaction has not been explored. Whereas other interacting E3s have been shown to cooperate in the catalysis of ubiquitination (e.g. BRCA1 and BARD1) (32Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 33Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), we found that the addition of Rad6-Rad18 did not affect free chain synthesis by Ubc13-Mms2 in either the presence or the absence of Rad5 (supplemental Fig. S1). This may not be surprising because, unlike the BRCA1 and BARD1 E3 ligases, Rad18 and Rad5 do not interact through their RING domains. We hypothesized two ways in which Rad5 could stimulate polyUb assembly by Ubc13-Mms2. Rad5 could stimulate the E1-catalyzed transthiolation that produces the Ubc13∼Ub thiolester, possibly by enhancing E1 interaction with Ubc13. Rad5 also could act after this step to promote the catalytic attack by Lys63 of the acceptor Ub on the thiolester bond of the donor Ub in Ubc13∼Ub. These two scenarios are not mutually exclusive. To examine whether Rad5 affects the E1-catalyzed charging of Ubc13 with Ub, we measured the rate of Ubc13∼Ub formation and its dependence on the presence of Rad5. The E1 enzyme catalyzed the formation of a Ubc13∼Ub thiolester between Ub(K63R) and the active site cysteine of Ubc13 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–5). Remarkably, in the presence of Rad5, the formation of the Ubc13∼Ub thiolester could no longer be detected (Fig. 2A, lanes 6–10). We repeated this reaction in the absence of Mms2, with a similar outcome (data not shown). Although these results seemed to indicate that Rad5 inhibits transthiolation of Ub from E1 to E2, this was highly unlikely because, as shown in Fig. 1, Rad5 stimulated ubiquitination. Furthermore, assays to monitor the accumulation of the AMP byproduct of the E1-catalyzed Ub activation revealed that E1 activity was not affected by Rad5 (Fig. 2B). The initial rates of AMP production, as well as ATP consumption (data not shown), were similar in the presence and absence of Rad5. Note that under these conditions Rad5 single-strand DNA-dependent ATPase activity (18Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28259-28262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was negligible, because the ADP product of this reaction did not accumulate (data not shown). In the absence of Rad5, AMP production plateaued as the limiting amounts of free Ubc13 were converted to Ubc13∼Ub. Inhibition did not occur in the presence of Rad5, suggesting that Rad5 may stimulate the turnover of Ubc13∼Ub. To investigate whether Rad5 affects that reactivity of the Ubc13∼Ub thiolester bond, we preformed complexes and evaluated their stabilities in the presence and absence of Rad5. Following depletion of ATP, Ubc13∼Ub intermediates were stable for >30 min in the absence of Rad5 (Fig. 2C, dotted line). Ubc13∼Ub intermediates were rapidly hydrolyzed upon the addition of Rad5, indicating that Rad5 increases reactivity of the thiolester bond (Fig. 2C, solid line). The ability of Rad5 to affect the thiolester bond stability relied upon binding to Ubc13. Thiolester destabilization was lost when Ubc13 binding was abrogated by the I196A mutation in the Rad5 RING domain (Fig. 2D). Similarly, when presented with a noncognate E2∼Ub thiolester intermediate containing E2–25K, Rad5 did not effect thiolester hydrolysis (Fig. 2E). These results are in accord with reports in which UbcH5b or Cdc34 thiolester intermediates were destabilized by their cognate RING E3s (25Ozkan E. Yu H. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18890-18895Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 1107-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Wu et al. (28Wu P.Y. Hanlon M. Eddins M. Tsui C. Rogers R.S. Jensen J.P. Matunis M.J. Weissman A.M. Wolberger C. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5241-5250Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have suggested that a conserved E2 asparagine residue (Asn79 in Ubc13) facilitates ubiquitination by stabilizing the charged intermediate formed when the lysine attacks the thiolester bond. Because crystal structures do not show this asparagine in a catalytically competent position, it was hypothesized that transient repositioning of this residue upon E2 binding to the E3 or Ub could be required to promote ubiquitination (15VanDemark A.P.

https://openalex.org/W2090847477,"CCN3 (NOV), a putative ligand for integrin receptors, is tightly associated with the extracellular matrix and mediates diverse cellular functions, including cell adhesion and proliferation. CCN3 has been shown to negatively regulate growth although it promotes migration in a cell type-specific manner. In this study, overexpression of CCN3 reduces growth and increases intercellular adhesion of breast cancer cells. Interestingly, CCN3 overexpression also led to the formation of multiple pseudopodia that are enriched in actin, CCN3, and vinculin. Breast cancer cells preincubated with exogenous CCN3 protein also induced the same phenotype, indicating that secreted CCN3 is sufficient to induce changes in cell morphology. Surprisingly, extracellular CCN3 is internalized to the early endosomes but not to the membrane protrusions, suggesting pseudopodia-enriched CCN3 may derive from a different source. The presence of an intracellular variant of CCN3 will be consistent with our finding that the cytoplasmic tail of the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) associates with CCN3. Cx43 is a channel protein permitting intercellular communication to occur. However, neither the channel properties nor the protein levels of Cx43 are affected by the CCN3 protein. In contrast, CCN3 proteins are down-regulated in the absence of Cx43. Finally, we showed that overexpression of CCN3 increases the activity of the small GTPase Rac1, thereby revealing a pathway that links Cx43 directly to actin reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W2081914097,"The nuclear lamina and its associated proteins are important for nuclear structure and chromatin organization and also have been implicated in the regulation of cell signaling and gene expression. In this study we demonstrate that the lamina-associated nuclear envelope transmembrane protein NET37 is required for myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. NET37, a member of glycosidase family 31, is highly expressed in mouse skeletal muscle and is strongly up-regulated during C2C12 differentiation. By protease mapping we show that its glycosidase homology domain is located in the lumen of the nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum. When NET37 is depleted from proliferating myoblasts by RNAi, myogenic differentiation is significantly impaired, and there is a concomitant delay in up-regulation of the late myogenic transcription factor myogenin. We expressed silencing-resistant NET37 mutated at a conserved residue in the glycosidase domain and found that this predicted catalytically inactive protein is unable to support myogenesis in cells depleted of wild type NET37. Therefore, the enzymatic function of NET37 appears to be important for myogenic differentiation. C2C12 cells depleted of NET37 have reduced activation of Akt after shifting to differentiation medium and are defective in insulin like growth factor-II (IGF-II) secretion, an autocrine/paracrine factor involved in Akt activation. We also observed that pro-IGF-II co-immunoprecipitates with NET37. Based on our results, we propose that NET37 has a role in IGF-II maturation in the secretory pathway during myoblast differentiation. The localization of NET37 at the nuclear envelope raises the possibility that it may coordinate myogenic events between the nuclear interior and the endoplasmic reticulum lumen via transmembrane communication."
https://openalex.org/W2004853012,"Deficiency of argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) causes argininosuccinic aciduria, an urea cycle defect that may present with a severe neonatal onset form or with a late onset phenotype. To date phenotype-genotype correlations are still not clear because biochemical assays of ASL activity correlate poorly with clinical severity in patients. We employed a yeast-based functional complementation assay to assess the pathogenicity of 12 missense ASL mutations, to establish genotype-phenotype correlations, and to screen for intragenic complementation. Rather than determining ASL enzyme activity directly, we have measured the growth rate in arginine-free medium of a yeast ASLnull strain transformed with individual mutant ASL alleles. Individual haploid strains were also mated to obtain diploid, “compound heterozygous” yeast. We show that the late onset phenotypes arise in patients because they harbor individual alleles retaining high residual enzymatic activity or because of intragenic complementation among different mutated alleles. In these cases complementation occurs because in the hybrid tetrameric enzyme at least one active site without mutations can be formed or because the differently mutated alleles can stabilize each other, resulting in partial recovery of enzymatic activity. Functional complementation in yeast is simple and reproducible and allows the analysis of large numbers of mutant alleles. Moreover, it can be easily adapted for the analysis of mutations in other genes involved in urea cycle disorders. Deficiency of argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) causes argininosuccinic aciduria, an urea cycle defect that may present with a severe neonatal onset form or with a late onset phenotype. To date phenotype-genotype correlations are still not clear because biochemical assays of ASL activity correlate poorly with clinical severity in patients. We employed a yeast-based functional complementation assay to assess the pathogenicity of 12 missense ASL mutations, to establish genotype-phenotype correlations, and to screen for intragenic complementation.

Argininosuccinic aciduria (ASAuria, MIM 207900) 3The abbreviations used are: ASAuriaargininosuccinic aciduriaASLargininosuccinate lyaseASAargininosuccinic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: ASAuriaargininosuccinic aciduriaASLargininosuccinate lyaseASAargininosuccinic acid. is an autosomal recessive disorder of the urea cycle caused by mutations of the ASL gene (hASL, MIM 608310), encoding argininosuccinate lyase (ASL; EC 4.3.2.1.) (1Brusilov S.W. Horwich A.L. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.in: Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 1909-1964Google Scholar). This enzyme is ubiquitously expressed and catalyzes the reversible breakdown of argininosuccinate to arginine and fumarate. ASL belongs to a superfamily of hydrolases that includes adenylosuccinate lyase and fumarase, which share a homotetrameric structure and a similar catalytic mechanism. The tetrameric structure of ASL accounts for the phenomenon of intragenic complementation. This particular situation occurs when a multimeric protein is formed from subunits produced by differently mutated alleles of the same gene. On complementation, a partially functional hybrid protein is produced from the two distinct types of mutant subunits, neither of which individually has appreciable enzymatic activity (2Turner M.A. Simpson A. McInnes R.R. Howell P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9063-9068Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). argininosuccinic aciduria argininosuccinate lyase argininosuccinic acid. argininosuccinic aciduria argininosuccinate lyase argininosuccinic acid. ASL participates to the urea cycle, and in humans it is essential for ammonia detoxification, whereas in lower organisms it is required for the biosynthesis of arginine. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains harboring a deletion of the homolog of human ASL (ARG4) cannot grow on media lacking arginine (3Barbosa P. Cialkowski M. O'Brien W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5286-5290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ASAuria is characterized by accumulation of argininosuccinic acid (ASA) in body fluids, and severe hyperammonaemia. The disease displays clinical heterogeneity with two main clinical phenotypes: the acute/neonatal onset form, with symptoms rapidly progressing to deep coma, apnea, and death (1Brusilov S.W. Horwich A.L. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.in: Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 1909-1964Google Scholar), and the subacute/late onset type, which is diagnosed in infancy or childhood (4Kleijer W.J. Garritsen V.H. Linnebank M. Mooyer P. Huijmans J.G. Mustonen A. Simola K.O. Arslan-Kirchner M. Battini R. Briones P. Cardo E. Mandel H. Tschiedel E. Wanders R.J. Koch H.G. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2002; 25: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Such patients may present simply with mental retardation or an epileptic disorder. In both types the diagnosis is established unambiguously by measuring plasma levels of ammonia (not always elevated in the late onset form), ASA, and its anhydrides by plasma amino acids assay (1Brusilov S.W. Horwich A.L. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.in: Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 1909-1964Google Scholar). Over 40 mutations of the ASL gene have been reported, both amino acid substitutions and truncating variants, which are scattered throughout the gene (5Linnebank M. Homberger A. Rapp B. Winter C.

Koch H.G. Hum. Genet. 2002; 111: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the identification of novel mutations of the ASL gene in a cohort of Italian patients (7Trevisson E. Salviati L. Baldoin M.C. Toldo I. Casarin A. Sacconi S. Cesaro L. Basso G. Burlina A.B. Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this study we employed a yeast model to validate the pathogenicity of missense ASL mutations found in our cohort, to study the effects of different allelic combinations, and to establish possible genotype-phenotype correlations. Clinical diagnosis of ASAuria was based on the quantification of plasma ASA by amino acid chromatography, levels of serum ammonia, and determination of urinary orotic acid, during the acute phase of the disease. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the Puregene kit (Gentra). The entire coding region of the ASL gene was amplified from genomic DNA and sequenced as previously described (7Trevisson E. Salviati L. Baldoin M.C. Toldo I. Casarin A. Sacconi S. Cesaro L. Basso G. Burlina A.B. Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Human total RNA was extracted and purified from about 106 cultured skin fibroblasts using the TRIzol kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Synthesis of total cDNA was carried out using SuperScript II kit for reverse transcription (Invitrogen) with random hexamers provided by the manufacturer. A cDNA fragment containing the entire coding region of the human ASL gene (hASL) was then amplified using primers −4F (5′-CAACATGGCCTCGGAGAGT-3′) and 1400R (5′-AGGACCTAGGCCTGCTGTG-3′) and an Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 1 min and 30 s, and a final extension step of 7 min at 68 °C. S. cerevisiae genomic DNA was extracted from the wild type strain BY4741 using standard rapid glass bead lysis and phenol-chloroform extraction as previously described (8Dimmer K.S. Navoni F. Casarin A. Trevisson E. Endele S. Winterpacht A. Salviati L. Scorrano L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The coding region of the yeast homolog of argininosuccinate lyase (ARG4) was amplified from genomic DNA using primers −5F (5′-CAAACATGTCAGACGGCACT-3′) and 1422R (5′-TGAAATTCTTGCGCATAACG-3′), and PCR conditions were as above. hASL and yeast ARG4 fragments were initially cloned into the yeast multi-copy expression vector pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen), containing the URA3 marker gene and a GAL1 promoter for the inducible expression of the inserted genes. The correctness and the reading frame of both plasmids were confirmed by direct sequencing. Specific mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol; mismatched primers were designed with the assistance of the Stratagene Primer Design software (sequences of primers are available upon request). The correctness of each construct was verified by direct sequencing. A control plasmid was generated by cutting the pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO-hASL vector with EcoRI (which cuts at position 799 related to the hASL ATG) and XbaI (which cuts the plasmid vector immediately after the hASL insert). After treatment with Klenow enzyme, to fill in the resulting overhangs, the fragment was recircularized by legation with T4 DNA ligase. The resulting construct encodes a truncated ASL protein, lacking 195 amino acids on the C terminus. Each mutant was then cloned into the centromeric pFL vectors. The 2.3-kb-long expression cassette containing the GAL1 promoter, the full hASL cDNA, and the CYC1 transcription termination sequence was amplified from the pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO-hASL construct using primers carrying adequate restriction sites (BamHIF, 5′-CTTCTGGATCCCTAGTACGGATTAGAAGCCGC-3′; and SphIR, 5′-CTCTTCGCATGCGCCGCAGCTTGCAAATTA-3′, with the restriction sites underlined) and an Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, 12 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 2 min, and a final extension step of 7 min at 68 °C. The PCR product was then digested with BamHI and SphI and cloned into the pFL38 and the pFL36 centromeric vectors (9Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G.Y. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes. The two pFL vectors differ only for the selection marker (URA3 for pFL38 and LEU2 for pFL36). All of the inserts were then sequenced. BY4741 (MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0) and BY4742 (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0) wild type strains and the isogenic strains ΔARG4 Y00981 (MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; YHR018c::kanMX4) and ΔARG4 Y10981 (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0; YHR018c::kanMX4) were purchased from Euroscarf Consortium. Yeast strains were cultured in rich medium (YPD) or synthetic minimal medium at 30 °C, as described (10Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 113-114Google Scholar). YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) was used to routinely maintain wild type and ΔARG4 strains. Synthetic minimal medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, ammonium sulfate 0.5%, carbon source 2%) contained the necessary auxotrophic supplements and different carbon sources according to the specific experiment: 2% galactose, to achieve maximal expression of hASL, or 2% raffinose plus galactose 0.01% when minimal hASL expression was required. Growth media components were purchased from Difco. All of the yeast DNA transformations were performed with the polyethylene glycol-lithium acetate method as previously described (11Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 107-120PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown in synthetic minimal medium lacking uracil plus 2% galactose until exponential phase for biochemical assays or to A600 nm of ∼4 for protein extraction and immunoblot analyses. The cells were harvested and mechanically lysed using standard rapid glass bead lysis in a MagnaLyzer instrument (Roche Applied Science). ASL activity was assayed as described (7Trevisson E.

Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). Equal aliquots of protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE. A monoclonal mouse anti-ASL antibody (Santa Cruz), followed by peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody allowed detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia). The blots were stripped and reprobed with mouse monoclonal antibody raised against yeast Porin (Mitosciences). The images were generated as reported previously (7Trevisson E. Salviati L. Baldoin M.C. Toldo I. Casarin A. Sacconi S. Cesaro L. Basso G. Burlina A.B. Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), using as templates for modeling the human ASL protein (Protein Data Bank code 1AOS) and Duck Delta Crystallin (Protein Data Bank code 1TJW), an ortholog of ASL, which is crystallized as a tetramer with its substrate. We have analyzed 12 missense mutations. Seven were reported by Trevisson et al. (7Trevisson E. Salviati L. Baldoin M.C. Toldo I. Casarin A. Sacconi S. Cesaro L. Basso G. Burlina A.B. Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and two novel changes were identified in other ASAuria patients in the course of this study: c.217G>A (E73K) and c.890G>A (R297Q). Two mutations found in our cohort had been previously reported (V178M and R182Q) but had not been characterized extensively, whereas the Q286R mutation (found in Patient 1) has been widely studied (14Sampaleanu L.M. Vallée F. Thompson G.D. Howell P.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15570-15580Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and was therefore included as a positive control.

We checked whether the hASL gene could complement our haploid yeast null mutant ΔARG4, a derivative of the BY4741 strain that harbors a deletion of the ARG4 gene and consequently is auxotrophic for arginine (Table 2).TABLE 2Summary of the characteristics of the mutations analyzed in this studyMutationClassGrowth in minimal mediumProtein stability (steady state levels)Proposed effect on proteinLow copy vectorHigh copy vector0.01% Gal2% Gal0.01% Gal2% GalQ286RaReported by Barbosa et al.

Open table in a new tab The coding regions of the human ASL gene and of its S. cerevisiae homolog ARG4 were subcloned into the multi-copy, galactose-inducible yeast expression vector pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO, carrying the URA3 gene as auxotrophic marker. This expression cassette, including the GAL1 promoter, the full coding region of the hASL gene, and the CYC1 transcription terminator, was also subcloned into the pFL38 (or pFL36) centromeric vector, carrying the same nutritional marker (URA3). The human and yeast wild type constructs or the empty vector were transformed into ΔARG4. The cells were grown in synthetic minimal medium lacking uracil, containing 2% galactose for 48 h at 30 °C and then plated at serial dilutions in selective synthetic minimal medium plates, lacking uracil and arginine, containing either 2% galactose or 0.01% galactose plus 2% raffinose. Raffinose has no effect on the GAL1 promoter but provides the carbon source for yeast growth. Under these conditions growth was indicative of functional complementation. Human ASL complemented the growth defect of deleted yeast strain when expressed from both plasmids, at both concentrations of inducer. We then checked by immunoblot analysis the levels of the ASL protein under these different conditions (vector type versus concentration of the inductor). As shown in Fig. 1, the highest level of expression of the ASL protein is achieved using the multi-copy number pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO vector in the presence of 2% galactose. Lower levels of protein were obtained with pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO-hASL grown in the presence of 0.01% galactose or with pFL38-hASL in the presence of 2% galactose, whereas pFL38-hASL in 0.01% galactose yielded the lowest expression. This functional complementation system was used to analyze the effects of missense mutations on ASL activity. Each of the 12 different missense mutations included in the study was introduced into the pFL38-hASL by site-specific mutagenesis. We also generated a further plasmid lacking 589 nucleotides on the 3′ region of the ASL gene to simulate truncating mutations. These plasmids were transformed into the null mutant strain ΔARG4, and we tested the ability of the resulting transformants to grow in the absence of arginine. Yeast cultures were grown as above in the presence of 2% galactose to induce ASL expression, and plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. Under these conditions we observed that all mutant alleles analyzed abolish yeast growth in arginine-deficient medium, except for V178M, V335L, and R456W alleles, which retain residual growth (Fig. 2). We measured ASL enzymatic activity in strains expressing each of these three mutations and in controls transformed with the wild type human gene, grown in SM-URA medium with 2% galactose. Mutant alleles displayed a reduced enzymatic activity compared with the wild type: 14% for V178M and 17% for V335L, whereas we could not detect significant activity in the R456W mutant. Taken together, these data confirm the pathogenicity of all the missense mutations found in our patients. We repeated the above functional complementation assay under conditions of maximal expression, using the mutagenized versions of the pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO-hASL construct in the presence of high (2%) or low (0.01%) levels of the galactose inducer. Under conditions of maximal expression, we detected some growth with four alleles (D31N, R186Q, R297Q, and M382R) (Fig. 3A), whereas results obtained with low inducer concentrations (Fig. 3B) were similar to those of pFL38-hASL grown in 2% galactose (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the similar levels of expression of the ASL protein with these different experimental conditions (Fig. 1). In parallel, V178M, V335L, and R456W alleles were expressed from the pFL38 vector in the presence of only 0.01% galactose. In this case we detected a clear growth defect compared with the wild type (Fig. 3C). These data allowed us to distinguish three classes of mutations: Class I, no growth under any condition: Q286R, R236W, R113Q, R182Q, E73K, and C-terminal deletion; Class II, no growth with minimal expression: D31N, R186Q, R297Q, M382R, and R456W; and Class III, growth with minimal expression, albeit reduced compared with wild type: V178M and V335L. All of the experiments were replicated using haploid strains of the opposite mating type and yielded overlapping results. Intragenic complementation has been invoked to explain some of the cases with mild phenotypes (14Sampaleanu L.M. Vallée F. Thompson G.D. Howell P.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15570-15580Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We devised a simple functional assay to verify the occurrence of intragenic complementation between different Class I ASL mutations. We chose these alleles because they do not grow under any of the conditions we tested. We transformed both the opposite mating types (MATa and MATα) ΔARG4 strains with each of the five human Class I alleles. The MATa ΔARG4 strain was transformed with the pFL38 (which expresses the URA3 selection marker) constructs and selected on synthetic minimal medium lacking uracil, whereas MATα ΔARG4 strain was transformed with the pFL36-derived constructs (obtained by cloning the pFL38 expression cassette in pFL36, which differs from pFL38 only for the presence of the LEU2 selection marker instead of URA3) and plated on synthetic minimal medium lacking leucine. We mated the transformants on plates and tested their growth in synthetic minimal medium lacking uracil and leucine (to select for the presence of both plasmids), but also methionine and lysine (for which the MATa and the MATα strains are respectively auxotrophic), and arginine (to select for the occurrence of intragenic complementation). As expected, no growth was seen in “homozygous” diploid strains, whereas some allelic combinations were able to rescue the growth phenotype (Fig. 4). The E73K allele appeared to be refractory to complementation because no growth was detected in any of the different diploid strains harboring this allele; Q286R and R182Q could restore growth in all other allele combinations. The R113Q/R236W combination did not restore any growth in diploid strains; however, these alleles allowed intragenic complementation when associated with the Q286R or R182Q mutations (Fig. 4). We investigated whether intragenic complementation could account for the mild phenotype displayed by Patient 10, who carried the R182Q and R297Q mutations. We mated MATa and MATα yeast transformed with each of these two alleles (cloned in the pFL38 or pFL36 plasmid as above). We detected growth in the “compound heterozygote” strain (R182Q/R297Q), whereas the “homozygote” strains (R182Q/R182Q or R297Q/R297Q) do not grow at all (Fig. 5), indicating that this combination of alleles results in partial rescue of the enzymatic activity of the tetramer, which is consistent with the milder phenotype observed in the patient. Interestingly, the lack of complementation of the R113Q/R236W combination correlates with the severe phenotype found in Patient 7, who harbored these two mutations (Fig. 4). The growth data and biochemical measurements obtained with the haploid strain indicate that the V178M allele retains significant residual activity, allowing growth of the corresponding transformant also when expressed at very low levels (Fig. 3C). This mutation has been reported in association with both the neonatal and the late onset phenotypes in distinct genotypic combinations. In fact, it was previously associated to a mild phenotype when present in a homozygous state (6Linnebank M. Tschiedel E. Häberle J. Linnebank A. Willenbring H. Kleijer W.J. Koch H.G. Hum. Genet. 2002; 111: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); we have found the same mutation in a compound heterozygous state with R236W (Patient 14) and with the truncating mutation c.839delG (Patient 11); both subjects presented with the late onset phenotype. However, we found also V178M in association with R186Q mutation in Patient 3 who apparently presented the severe phenotype (7Trevisson E. Salviati L. Baldoin M.C. Toldo I. Casarin A. Sacconi S. Cesaro L. Basso G. Burlina A.B. Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To explain this discrepancy, we hypothesized that the R186Q allele might have a sort of dominant negative effect, displaying an effect opposite to intragenic complementation. We therefore analyzed the effects of V178M in compound heterozygosity with either the R186Q mutant or the truncating mutation. As a further control we studied the combination of R186Q and the high complementing Q286R allele. We crossed both the mating types of yeast transformed with the corresponding mutated constructs as above. Expression was induced with 0.01% galactose to increase the sensitivity of the assay. As shown in Fig. 6, the V178M mutation in the homozygous state displays a slightly reduced growth pattern compared with the wild type. There is a further reduction of growth when V178M is in combination with either the deletion mutant or R186Q. However, the growth of the V178M/DEL and V178M/R186Q combinations is similar, and we observed intragenic complementation with the R186Q/Q286R combination. These data reject the hypothesis of a dominant negative effect for the R186Q allele. The knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the ASL enzyme allows predictions regarding the effect of individual mutants on protein structure and function. In a previous work we analyzed the consequences of some of the mutations included in the study (7Trevisson E. Salviati L. Baldoin M.C. Toldo I. Casarin A. Sacconi S. Cesaro L. Basso G. Burlina A.B. Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). D31N, R113W, and R236W affect the active site of the enzyme (see Fig. 3B of Trevisson et al. (7Trevisson E. Salviati L. Baldoin M.C. Toldo I. Casarin A. Sacconi S. Cesaro L. Basso G. Burlina A.B. Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)), and R186Q and R456W are predicted to alter the interaction between individual monomers (see Fig. 4 of Trevisson et al.

The substitution of valine 335 with a leucine is predicted to distort the central domain of the protein. Q286R was previously reported to affect the active site (2Turner M.A. Simpson A. McInnes R.R.

Analysis of the other mutations included in the study showed that arginine 182 is located in domain 2 of the protein, and it is critical for the interaction of two distinct subunits, forming hydrogen bonds with aspartate 231 of the opposite monomer (Fig. 7A). In this region a series of acidic and basic residues form a sort of “molecular zipper” that maintains the association of the monomers. Disr"

As the enzymatic core of the hydrolase domain of the human sEH contains two tyrosine residues (Tyr383 and Tyr466) that are theoretically crucial for enzymatic activity, we addressed the hypothesis that the activity of the sEH may be affected by nitrosative stress. Epoxide hydrolase activity was detected in human and murine endothelial cells as well in HEK293 cells and could be inhibited by either authentic peroxynitrite (ONOO−) or the ONOO− generator 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1). Protection of the enzymatic core with 1-adamantyl-3-cyclohexylurea in vitro decreased sensitivity to SIN-1. Both ONOO− and SIN-1 elicited the tyrosine nitration of the sEH protein and mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic fragments revealed nitration on several tyrosine residues including Tyr383 and Tyr466. Mutation of the latter residues to phenylalanine was sufficient to abrogate epoxide hydrolase activity. In vivo, streptozotocin-induced diabetes resulted in the tyrosine nitration of the sEH in murine lungs and a significant decrease in its activity. Taken together, these data indicate that the activity of the sEH can be regulated by the tyrosine nitration of the protein. Moreover, nitrosative stress would be expected to potentiate the physiological actions of arachidonic acid epoxides by preventing their metabolism to the corresponding diols.

Over the last decade, a great deal has been discovered about the physiological role of cytochrome P450-derived epoxides, such as those generated from arachidonic and linoleic acid, in the regulation of vascular homeostasis (1Spector A.A. Norris A.W. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C996-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). For example, CYP2C- and CYP2J-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) 3The abbreviations used are: EETepoxyeicosatrienoic acidACU1-adamantyl-3-cyclohexylureaDHETdihydroxyeicosatrienoic acidONOO−peroxynitritesEHsoluble epoxide hydrolaseSIN-13-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride. 3The abbreviations used are: EETepoxyeicosatrienoic acidACU1-adamantyl-3-cyclohexylureaDHETdihydroxyeicosatrienoic acidONOO−peroxynitritesEHsoluble epoxide hydrolaseSIN-13-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride. can acutely regulate vascular tone by inducing endothelial and smooth muscle cell hyperpolarization in the systemic circulation while promoting constriction in pulmonary circulation. EETs also stimulate a number of endothelial signaling cascades to promote angiogenesis (2Michaelis U.R. Fleming I. Pharmacol.

The arachidonic acid epoxides (apart from 5,6-EET) are chemically stable, and their intracellular level is tightly regulated by a number of different mechanisms including β-oxidation (3Fang X. Weintraub N.L. Oltman C.L. Stoll L.L. Kaduce T.L. Harmon S. Dellsperger K.C. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Spector A.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

However, of these regulatory mechanisms, it appears that the physiologically most important enzyme for the intracellular regulation of EET levels is the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) (5Yu Z. Xu F. Huse L.M. Morisseau C. Draper A.J. Newman J.W. Parker C. Graham L. Engler M.M. Hammock B.D. Zeldin D.C. Kroetz D.L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) generated from the EETs by sEH are biologically active, although generally less so than the parent epoxides (for review, see Ref. 6Roman R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 131-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Indeed, when the EETs are converted to the more polar DHETs, they are not as readily incorporated into membrane lipids (7VanRollins M. Kaduce T.L. Knapp H.R. Spector A.A. J.

Physiol. 1999; 277: H2098-2108PubMed Google Scholar) and rapidly leave cells as diols or as still more polar conjugates. Surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that regulate sEH activity, and although there have been a number of studies linking changes in sEH expression with inflammatory or hormonal stimuli (9Newman J.W. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 10Ai D. Fu Y. Guo D. Tanaka H. Wang N. Tang C. Hammock B.D. Shyy J.Y. Zhu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9018-9023Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), nothing is known about the regulation of sEH by post-translational modification. Given that two tyrosine residues (Tyr383 and Tyr466) in the active site of the hydrolase are reportedly essential for enzyme activity (11Yamada T. Morisseau C. Maxwell J.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23082-23088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we determined whether or not the sEH could be regulated by tyrosine nitration. 3-Morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1), 14,15-EET, 14,15-d8-EET, and recombinant human sEH were from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI) and NADPH from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany). The sEH inhibitor 1-adamantyl-3-cyclohexylurea (ACU) and the microsomal epoxide hydrolase inhibitor elaidamide were synthesized as described (12Morisseau C. Goodrow M.H. Newman J.W. Wheelock C.E. Dowdy D.L. Hammock B.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Morisseau C. Newman J.W. Dowdy D.L. Goodrow M.H. Hammock B.D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The anti-human sEH antibody used was purified by Eurogenetec (Seraing, Belgium) from rabbits immunized with two sEH peptides (H2N-KGYGESSAPPEIEEYC-CONH2 and H2N-CGHWTQMDKPTEV-CONH2), and the polyclonal anti-mouse sEH antibody (dilution of 1:2000) used was raised against a recombinant murine sEH produced in a baculovirus expression system and then purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography. The anti-nitrotyrosine antibody was from Millipore (Billerica, MA), and the antibody used to immunoprecipitate c-Myc was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). All other chemicals were purchased from either Sigma or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Human umbilical vein and murine lung endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as described (14Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dixit M. Busse R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4103-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Second to third passage endothelial cells were used throughout. HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured with minimal essential medium (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria), supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mmol/liter nonessential amino acids, 1 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate, 50, 000 units/liter penicillin, and 50 mg/liter streptomycin, and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described (15Dixit M. Loot A.E. Mohamed A. Fisslthaler B. Boulanger C.M. Ceacareanu B. Hassid A. Busse R. Fleming I. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1236-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The activity of the sEH was determined using cytosolic cell lysates generated as described (16Muller D.N. Schmidt C. Barbosa-Sicard E. Wellner M. Gross V. Hercule H. Markovic M. Honeck H. Luft F.C. Schunck W.H. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 20 min in 100 μl of 100 mmol/liter potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5 μg protein. The samples were incubated with either solvent (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) or ACU (10 μmol/liter), in the absence or presence of SIN-1 (0.5 mmol/liter) for 60 min (37 °C). Reactions were started by the addition of 14,15-EET (10 μmol/liter), stopped on ice, and immediately extracted twice with ethyl acetate (0.7 ml). In some experiments (protection assay), 1 μg recombinant human sEH was incubated with 1 mmol/liter SIN-1, with and without 10 μmol/liter ACU in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 1 h at 37 °C. After that, ACU was removed by 1h dialysis against buffer at 4 °C, followed by a standard assay (see above) with 1/10 of the reaction (corresponding 0.1 μg sEH) for 20 min at 37 °C. For liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis one tenth of the sample was spiked with a deuterated internal standard (14,15-EET-d8). After evaporation of the solvent in a vacuum block under a gentle stream of nitrogen, the residues were reconstituted with 50 μl of methanol/water (1:1, v/v) and determined with a Sciex API4000 mass spectrometer operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode as described (17Pokreisz P. Fleming I. Kiss L. Barbosa-Sicard E. Fisslthaler B. Falck J.R. Hammock B.D. Kim I.H. Szelid Z. Vermeersch P. Gillijns H. Pellens M. Grimminger F. van Zonneveld A.J. Collen D. Busse R. Janssens S. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Chromatographic separation was performed on a Gemini C18 column (150 mm length, 2 mm inner diameter; particle size, 5 μm; Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany). Because of the differences between the different cell types and between the different assays (human and murine endothelial cells ranged between 0.2–1 ng/ml; human embryonic kidney (HEK) from 5–100 ng/ml), the data were normalized with respect to the solvent control. In solution, digests were performed as described (18Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar). Protein samples were resuspended in HEPES buffer (10 mmol/liter; pH 8.0) containing 6 mol/liter urea and 2 mol/liter thiourea. After reduction and alkylation with threo-1,4-dimercapto-2,3-butanediol (1 mmol/liter) and iodoacetamide (5.5 mmol/liter), proteins were digested with LysC (Wako, Neuss, Germany) and trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at room temperature overnight. The reaction was stopped by acidifying with trifluoroacetic acid to pH 2.5. Samples were desalted and concentrated with “STAGE” tips as described (19Rappsilber J. Mann M. Ishihama Y. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1896-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed as described (20Olsen J.V. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13417-13422Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Briefly, reverse phase nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was done using an Agilent 1200 Nanoflow liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies). The liquid chromatography system was coupled to a Orbitrap XL instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark). Chromatographic separation of peptides was performed in a 15-cm long/75-μm inner diameter capillary needle (Proxeon) packed in house with reverse phase ReproSil-Pur C18 AQ 3 μm resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). The tryptic peptide mixtures were autosampled at a flow rate of 0.5 μl/min and then eluted with a linear gradient at a flow rate 0.2 μl/min. The mass spectrometers were operated in the data-dependent mode to automatically measure MS and MS/MS. Full scan MS spectra were acquired with a resolution r = 60,000 at m/z 400. The 10 most intense ions were selected for MS/MS. Mass spectra were analyzed by the software MaxQuant (21Cox J. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (8612) Google Scholar). The following search parameters were used in all MASCOT searches: maximum of two missed cleavages, cysteine carbamidomethylation, methionine oxidation, and nitrotyrosine. The maximum error tolerance for MS scans was 10 ppm and 0.5 Da for MS/MS, respectively. The data were searched against a mouse international protein index (International protein index version 3.45) concatenated with reversed versions of all sequences. The required false discovery rate was set to 1% at the protein level. The cDNA of the sEH (gene synonym: EPHX2, BC011628) was purchased as a full-length clone (IRAUp969B0651D) from RZPD (Berlin, Germany) and then cloned with AgeI and EcoRI into a linker modified c-Myc-containing pcDNA3.1− (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The mutation of tyrosine residues 383 and 466 into phenylalanine or of the arginine 99 into histidine was achieved with the QuikChange® multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mmol/liter (pH 7.5) Tris/HCl, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 2 mmol/liter EGTA, 2 mmol/liter EDTA; 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 25 mmol/liter NaF, 10 mmol/liter Na4P2O7, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, antipain, aprotinin, chymostatin, and trypsin inhibitor. Tyrosine nitrated proteins and c-Myc were immunoprecipitated (from 250 μg protein) with the appropriate antibodies. Detergent soluble proteins or immunoprecipitates were heated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then separated by SDS-PAGE, and specific proteins were detected by immunostaining as described (14Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dixit M. Busse R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4103-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 mice and ob/ob mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). sEH−/− mice (22Sinal C.J. Miyata M. Tohkin M. Nagata K. Bend J.R. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40504-40510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Frank Gonzalez (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland) and crossbred for 10 generations onto the C57BL/6 background in the animal house facility at Frankfurt University. Mice were housed under conditions recommended by the National Institutes of Health. The ob/ob mice were housed under normal conditions and sacrificed at the age of 20 weeks. To induce diabetes, C57BL/6 mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (180 mg/kg). After 4 weeks, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and blood was immediately collected for blood glucose determination. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed, and the lungs were flushed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Both the university animal care committee and the federal authority for animal research (Regierungspräsidium Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany) approved the study protocol. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E., and statistical evaluation was performed using Student's t test for unpaired data or one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni t test when appropriate. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The expression of the sEH protein was detectable in human umbilical vein endothelial cells as well as in murine lung endothelial cells (Fig. 1A). The cell lysates analyzed also hydrolyzed 14,15-EET to 14,15-DHET, as determined by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 1B). The latter reaction was unaffected by the microsomal epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, elaidamide, but was significantly attenuated (by 61 ± 4% and 70 ± 3% in human and murine endothelial cells, respectively) by the selective sEH inhibitor, ACU (10 μmol/liter, Fig. 1B). The sEH inhibitor reduced activity in cell lysates to levels comparable with those measured in lung endothelial cells derived from sEH−/− mice. As two tyrosine residues in the enzymatic core of the sEH (Tyr383 and Tyr466) are required for full catalytic activity (11Yamada T. Morisseau C. Maxwell J.E. Argiriadi M.A. Christianson D.W. Hammock B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23082-23088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we determined whether or not the activity of the enzyme could be affected by nitration of the tyrosine residues. We therefore assessed the consequences of incubating sEH-expressing cell lysates with the ONOO− donor, SIN-1. The sEH was expressed in HEK293 cells under basal conditions, but overexpression of the protein increased enzyme activity by ∼7-fold (Fig. 2). Both the endogenous sEH activity as well as that of the overexpressed enzyme was almost abolished by incubation with SIN-1. To test the hypothesis that the nitration of tyrosine residues in the enzymatic core is able to regulate activity, we generated sEH mutants in which the C-terminal epoxide hydrolase was inactivated by the mutation of Tyr383 and Tyr466 to phenylalanine (Y383F,Y466F). Overexpression of the Y383F,Y466F sEH mutant decreased epoxide hydrolase activity to the level detected in untransfected cells (Fig. 2). Although SIN-1 also attenuated 14,15-DHET production in these cells, this can be attributed to the inhibition of the endogenous wild-type enzyme expressed in the HEK cells used rather than to a residual activity of the construct employed. The sEH is a bifunctional enzyme that possesses both a phosphatase and a hydrolase domain (23Newman J.W. Morisseau C. Harris T.R. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1558-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Cronin A. Mowbray S. Dürk H. Homburg S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Oesch F. Arand M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, mutation of the N-terminal phosphatase domain by the replacement of Arg99 with histidine had little effect on epoxide hydrolase activity per se, and the activity of this mutant remained sensitive to SIN-1 (Fig. 2). We next assessed sEH activity in cultured human endothelial cells and found that both SIN-1 and authentic ONOO− were able to decrease sEH activity by ∼50% (Fig. 3A). A similar effect was recorded using lung endothelial cells isolated from wild-type mice (Fig. 3B). A residual sEH activity (30% of that detected in the wild-type) was detected in lung endothelial cells from sEH−/− mice and the generation of 14,15-DHET from 14,15-EET was also attenuated in these cells by treatment with SIN-1. As the isolated murine sEH is sensitive to oxidation (25Gill S.S. Hammock B.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we determined the consequence of oxidative stress in the form of hydrogen peroxide on the activity of the sEH in human endothelial cells. Hydrogen peroxide had no effect on the activity of the sEH in endothelial cells (Fig. 3C), indicating that oxidation of the protein did not significantly affect enzyme activity. Moreover, excess amounts of sodium nitroprusside or glutathione also failed to affect basal sEH activity (supplemental Fig. 1). However, glutathione prevented the SIN-1-induced loss of sEH activity. The ability of ONOO− to tyrosine nitrate the sEH was assessed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. We observed that while the c-Myc-tagged sEH recovered from HEK cell lysates treated with inactivated ONOO− (i.e. ONOO− incubated in bicarbonate-containing buffer for 24 h; 37 °C) demonstrated only a weak signal, tyrosine nitration of the protein was however clearly evident in samples treated with fresh ONOO− (Fig. 4A). The immunoprecipitation of tyrosine-nitrated proteins from cell lysates also resulted in the recovery of the sEH (data not shown). Similarly, the treatment of intact endothelial cells with SIN-1 also increased the tyrosine nitration of the proteins. Identical results were obtained when the c-Myc-tagged sEH (data not shown) or tyrosine-nitrated proteins were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4B). Detailed analysis of tryptic peptide fragments of the human recombinant sEH by LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometry revealed that the enzyme was nitrated following incubation with SIN-1. For example, the peptide containing Tyr466 underwent a 45-Da mass shift following incubation with SIN-1, indicating its nitration (Fig. 5A). A similar mass shift was also detected in the peptide containing Tyr383 (Fig. 5B). To determine whether the active site of the sEH is sensitive to SIN-1, we preincubated the recombinant enzyme with ACU, which binds to the active site of the enzyme (12Morisseau C. Goodrow M.H. Newman J.W. Wheelock C.E. Dowdy D.L. Hammock B.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), before adding the ONOO− donor SIN-1 (0.5 mmol/liter). After a dialysis step to remove the inhibitor, we assessed sEH activity and found that ACU partially protected the active site of the enzyme against inactivation (Fig. 5B). Diabetes is associated with redox stress and the generation of large amonunts of peroxynitrite, evidenced by the fact that plasma levels of nitrotyrosine increase markedly during disease development (26Ceriello A. Mercuri F. Quagliaro L. Assaloni R. Motz E. Tonutti L. Taboga C. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 27Randriamboavonjy V. Pistrosch F. Bölck B. Schwinger R.H. Dixit M. Badenhoop K. Cohen R.A. Busse R. Fleming I. Circulation. 2008; 117: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether or not the sEH could be tyrosine-nitrated under pathophysiological conditions, diabetes (glucose > 2 mg/liter) was induced with streptozotocin and the tyrosine nitration of the sEH assessed in the mouse lung. Low levels of sEH were detected in nitrotyrosine immunoprecipitates from control animals (Fig. 6A). The induction of diabetes was without effect on sEH levels in the lung lysates but clearly resulted in its tyrosine nitration. Similarly, diabetes was associated with a 47 ± 7% decrease in sEH activity (Fig. 6B). The phenomenon observed was not restricted to type 1 diabetes as a similar decrease in sEH activity (72% versus non diabetic C57BL/6) was detected in lungs from 20-week-old ob/ob mice (glucose >2.5 mg/liter; supplemental Fig. 2). The results of the present investigation indicate that the activity of the soluble sEH can be regulated by stimuli/conditions, i.e. the ONOO− donor SIN-1 and authentic ONOO−, that mimic nitrosative stress. Both of these stimuli resulted in the tyrosine nitration of the protein as well as a decrease in enzyme activity, i.e. DHET production. The phenomenon described was also observed in vivo in mice with diabetes. In biological systems, nitric oxide combines rapidly with superoxide anions to form ONOO−, which has been implicated in many inflammatory diseases. One important consequence of these reactive intermediates is the post-translational modification of protein tyrosine residues, resulting in the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine. This modification has been accepted as a footprint of nitrosative damage in vivo and can occur through two relevant nitration pathways; namely ONOO− and heme peroxidase-dependent nitration and is generally viewed as a consequence of a loss of the balance between oxidant formation and anti-oxidant mechanisms (for recent reviews, see Refs. 28Peluffo G. Radi R. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar and 29Goldstein S. Merényi G. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 436: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). While the function of some proteins is enhanced by their tyrosine nitration, others, such as the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase (30Viner R.I. Ferrington D.A. Williams T.D. Bigelow D.J. Schöneich C. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and the prostacyclin synthase (31Zou M. Martin C. Ullrich V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), are inactivated. The functional consequences of nitration therefore depend on the tyrosine residues that are nitrated, as not all of the residues in a given protein are equally susceptible or relevant for enzymatic activity (32Bartesaghi S. Ferrer-Sueta G. Peluffo G. Valez V. Zhang H. Kalyanaraman B. Radi R. Amino. Acids. 2007; 32: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). There is no easy recipe to determine the susceptibility of a given tyrosine residue to nitration, but a number of factors favor the process, such as the presence of an acidic amino acid close to tyrosine, the localization of a tyrosine residue on a loop structure, and the nearby presence of transition metal centers and binding sites for heme peroxidases (see Ref. 32Bartesaghi S. Ferrer-Sueta G. Peluffo G. Valez V. Zhang H. Kalyanaraman B. Radi R. Amino. Acids. 2007; 32: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar and references therein). Taking these points into consideration Tyr383 seems to be a likely candidate for nitration. The latter residue is only one of 13 tyrosine residues in the sEH protein, but is one of a pair situated in the enzymatic core (Tyr383 and Tyr466) that seem to be essential for the maintenance of enzymatic activity (11Yamada T.

The importance of the two tyrosine residues in the enzymatic core of the sEH is to donate protons to the epoxide and thus to lower the enzymatic barrier for the next step in the proposed sEH reaction mechanism. Previous studies using the murine sEH demonstrated that the mutagenesis of the corresponding tyrosine residues (Tyr381 and Tyr465) to phenylalanine caused an almost complete inhibition of the hydrolysis of multiple sEH substrates to their diols (11Yamada T.

To date, the human enzyme has only been addressed in in silico studies, which highlighted the theoretical importance of the tyrosine residues in the reaction mechanism (33Hopmann K.H. Himo F. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; 110: 21299-21310Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Indeed, the aromatic amino acids (Trp and Phe) that neighbor Tyr466 make this residue acidic and so stabilizing the tyrosyl radical (34Argiriadi M.A. Morisseau C. Goodrow M.H. Dowdy D.L. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15265-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and making Tyr466 a good target for nitration. Our results in HEK cells overexpressing the human sEH Y383F,Y466F mutant confirmed the prediction made in the latter study, as mutation abolished the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze 14,15-EET. It also seems that the tyrosine residues in the active center are susceptible to attack by ONOO− as the treatment of cell lysates as well as intact cells with the ONOO− donor SIN-1 decreased hydrolase activity. Furthermore, the pretreatment of recombinant sEH with the reversible inhibitor ACU led to a reduced sensitivity to SIN-1 indicating that the intercalation of the inhibitor protects the active site of the enzyme. sEH is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that has been detected in brain, heart, kidney, and liver (35Enayetallah A.E.

However, we are only starting to learn about the implications of sEH inhibition in physiological and pathophysiological responses. Expression of sEH is up-regulated in some, but not all, forms of inflammation. For example, in vasculature, sEH expression increases in response to elevated angiotensin II levels (10Ai D. Fu Y. Guo D. Tanaka H. Wang N. Tang C. Hammock B.D. Shyy J.Y. Zhu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9018-9023Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and sEH inhibitors are very effective at normalizing angiotensin II-induced hypertension (37Jung O. Brandes R.P. Kim I.H. Schweda F. Schmidt R. Hammock B.D. Busse R. Fleming I. Hypertension. 2005; 45: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 40Imig J.D. Zhao X. Capdevila J.H. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the lung, tobacco smoke is reported to increase sEH expression (41Maresh J.G. Xu H. Jiang N. Gairola C.G. Shohet R.V. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 21: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), an event linked to associated smoke-induced pathology, as sEH inhibitors attenuate smoke-induced lung inflammation (42Smith K.R. Pinkerton K.E. Watanabe T. Pedersen T.L. Ma S.J. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2186-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that by increasing tissue levels of epoxides, sEH inhibitors can exert anti-inflammatory effects. A similar anti-inflammatory effect may also result from the tyrosine nitration of the protein and represent an endogenous cytoprotective mechanism. Although positive effects can be expected from sEH inhibition, the enzyme also seems to have a darker side, as sEH deletion reduces survival after cardiac arrest (43Hutchens M.P. Nakano T. Dunlap J. Traystman R.J. Hurn P.D. Alkayed N.J. Resuscitation. 2008; 76: 89-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and genetic variation in the sEH gene (EPHX2) has been linked to a higher incidence of stroke in rats as well as in humans (44Corenblum M.J. Wise V.E. Georgi K. Hammock B.D. Doris P.A. Fornage M. Hypertension. 2008; 51: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 45Gschwendtner A. Ripke S. Freilinger T. Lichtner P. Müller-Myhsok B. Wichmann H.E. Meitinger T. Dichgans M. Stroke. 2008; 39: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, sEH inhibition may also compromise ventilation/perfusion adaptation in the lung (17Pokreisz P. Fleming I. Kiss L. Barbosa-Sicard E. Fisslthaler B. Falck J.R. Hammock B.D. Kim I.H. Szelid Z. Vermeersch P. Gillijns H. Pellens M. Grimminger F. van Zonneveld A.J. Collen D. Busse R. Janssens S. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is likely that the global consequences of changes in sEH activity are dependent on the relative amounts of the different epoxides (e.g. those derived from arachidonic or linoleic acid) generated within a given organ as sEH-derived diols have distinct biological properties. Indeed, the DHETs are clearly less inflammatory than the leukotoxin diol, which has previously been implicated in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (46Zheng J. Plopper C.G. Lakritz J. Storms D.H. Hammock B.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Several disease states are associated with elevated tyrosine nitration, and as elevated circulating levels of nitrotyrosine have been reported in diabetes (26Ceriello A. Mercuri F. Quagliaro L. Assaloni R. Motz E. Tonutti L. Taboga C. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 27Randriamboavonjy V. Pistrosch F. Bölck B. Schwinger R.H. Dixit M. Badenhoop K. Cohen R.A. Busse R. Fleming I. Circulation. 2008; 117: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we assessed the consequences of streptozotocin treatment on sEH in mouse lung. The results obtained clearly indicate that sEH can be tyrosine-nitrated in vivo in diabetic mice and that this results in decreased enzymatic activity. In the present investigation, we failed to observe any consequence of diabetes on pulmonary sEH expression in either the ob/ob or streptozotocin-treated mice. However, changes in sEH expression in diabetes have been described. For example, sEH expression is increased in mesenteric arteries from obese Zucker rats (47Zhao X. Dey A. Romanko O.P. Stepp D.W. Wang M.H. Zhou Y. Jin L. Pollock J.S. Webb R.C. Imig J.D. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp.

Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 4291-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, sEH levels remain low in livers from insulin-resistant type 1 interleukin-1 receptor−/− mice (50de Roos B. Rungapamestry V. Ross K. Rucklidge G. Reid M. Duncan G. Horgan G. Toomey S. Browne J. Loscher C.E. Mills K.H. Roche H.M. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 3244-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Why a change in sEH expression was not detected in either of the diabetes models studied in the present investigation is unclear, but may be due to the fact that we focused on the lung. Rather, we found that diabetes was clearly linked to a decrease in sEH activity, which correlated with its tyrosine nitration. Currently, it is only possible to speculate about the involvement of sEH tyrosine nitration in the amplification of inflammation associated with diabetes, but at least one sEH polymorphism, which results in decreased enzymatic activity, has previously been associated with human insulin resistance (51Ohtoshi K.

AHSP forms a specific complex with αHb and suppresses the heme-catalyzed evolution of reactive oxygen species by converting αHb to a conformation in which the heme is coordinated at both axial positions by histidine side chains (bis-histidyl coordination). Currently, the detailed mechanism by which AHSP induces structural changes in αHb has not been determined. Here, we present x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and mutagenesis data that identify, for the first time, the importance of an evolutionarily conserved proline, Pro30, in loop 1 of AHSP. Mutation of Pro30 to a variety of residue types results in reduced ability to convert αHb. In complex with αHb, AHSP Pro30 adopts a cis-peptidyl conformation and makes contact with the N terminus of helix G in αHb. Mutations that stabilize the cis-peptidyl conformation of free AHSP, also enhance the αHb conversion activity. These findings suggest that AHSP loop 1 can transmit structural changes to the heme pocket of αHb, and, more generally, highlight the importance of cis-peptidyl prolyl residues in defining the conformation of regulatory protein loops. α-Hemoglobin (αHb) stabilizing protein (AHSP) is expressed in erythropoietic tissues as an accessory factor in hemoglobin synthesis.

Numerous mechanisms exist to balance and coordinate HbA synthesis in normal erythropoiesis, and problems with the production of either HbA subunit give rise to thalassemia, a common cause of anemia worldwide. Previously, we identified α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) as an accessory factor in normal HbA production (1Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russell J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A.

Free αHb promotes the formation of harmful reactive oxygen species as a result of reduction/oxidation reactions involving the heme iron (7Alayash A.I. Nat. Rev.

Reactive oxygen species can damage heme, αHb, and other cellular structures, resulting in hemoglobin precipitates and death of erythroid precursor cells (9Fessas P. Blood. 1963; 21: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nathan D.G. Stossel T.B. Gunn R.B. Zarkowsky H.S. Laforet M.T. J. Clin.

The presence of AHSP may explain how cells tolerate the slight excess of αHb that is observed in normal erythropoiesis, which is postulated to inhibit the formation of non-functional βHb tetramers, thus providing a robust mechanism for achieving the correct subunit stoichiometry during HbA assembly (13Luzzatto L. Notaro R. Nature. 2002; 417: 703-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical studies have begun to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which AHSP detoxifies αHb. AHSP binds to oxygenated αHb to generate an initial complex that retains the oxy-heme, as evidenced by a characteristic visible absorption spectrum (see Fig. 1B, middle) and resonance Raman spectrum (5Feng L. Gell D.A. Zhou S. Gu L. Kong Y. Li J. Hu M. Yan N. Lee C. Rich A.M. Armstrong R.S. Lay P.A. Gow A.J. Weiss M.J. Mackay J.P. Shi Y.

Gell D.A. Mackay J.P. Weiss M.J. Gow A.J. Shi Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), in which the heme iron is bound at both axial positions by the side chains of His58 and His87 from αHb (see Fig. 1B, right). The formation of this complex inhibits αHb peroxidase activity and heme loss (2Feng L. Zhou S. Gu L. Gell D.A. Mackay J.P. Weiss M.J. Gow A.J. Shi Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Bis-histidyl heme coordination is becoming increasingly recognized as a feature of numerous vertebrate and non-vertebrate globins (14de Sanctis D. Pesce A. Nardini M. Bolognesi M. Bocedi A. Ascenzi P. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and has been shown previously to confer a relative stabilization of the Fe3+ over the Fe2+ oxidation state (15Halder P.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6541-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although bis-histidyl heme coordination has previously been detected in solutions of met-Hb, formed through spontaneous autoxidation of Hb (18Levy A. Rifkind J.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6050-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Peterson-Kennedy S.E. McGourty J.L. Kalweit J.A. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem.

Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3356-3366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the bishis-αHb·AHSP complex provides the first evidence that the bis-histidyl heme may play a positive functional role in Hb biochemistry by inhibiting the production of harmful reactive oxygen species. Despite its potential importance, the mechanism by which AHSP influences heme coordination in its binding partner is still unknown. As shown in Fig. 1A, AHSP binds αHb at a surface away from the heme pocket, and thus structural changes must somehow be transmitted through the αHb protein. It is intriguing that the free AHSP protein switches between two alternative conformations linked to cis/trans isomerization of the Asp29-Pro30 peptide bond in loop 1 (22Santiveri C.M. Pérez-Cañadillas J.M. Vadivelu M.K. Allen M.D. Rutherford T.J. Watkins N.A. Bycroft M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34963-34970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and that, in complex with αHb, this loop is located at the αHb·AHSP interface (see Fig. 1A). Peptide bonds preceding proline residues are unique in that the cis or trans bonding conformations have relatively similar stabilities (23Fischer G. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2000; 29: 119-127Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar), allowing an interconversion between these conformations that can be important for protein function (24Shaw P.E. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Lu K.P. Finn G. Lee T.H. Nicholson L.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Previous x-ray crystal structures of αHb·AHSP complexes have been obtained only with a P30A mutant of AHSP, in which isomerization is abolished and the Asp29-Ala30 peptide bond adopts a trans conformation, leaving the potential structural and functional significance of the evolutionarily conserved Pro30 undisclosed. Here, we demonstrate a functional role for AHSP Pro30 in conversion of oxy-αHb to the bis-histidyl form and identify a specific structural role for a cis Asp29-Pro30 peptide bond in this process. From a mechanistic understanding of how AHSP promotes formation of bis-histidyl αHb, we may eventually be able to engineer AHSP function as a tool in new treatments for Hb diseases such as β-thalassemia. Full-length human AHSP (102 residues), and a construct with the C-terminal unstructured residues deleted (AHSP residues 1–90; AHSP-(1–90), were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified as described previously (3Gell D. Kong Y. Eaton S.A. Weiss M.J. Mackay J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40602-40609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The final purified proteins contained an additional Gly-Ser at the N terminus as a consequence of the expression system. αHb from human blood was purified as described previously (3Gell D. Kong Y.

Isotopic labeling of ASHP was achieved by expression in shaker flasks with 15NH4Cl and 13C-glucose as sole nitrogen and carbon sources (26Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Met-αHb was prepared from oxy-αHb by oxidation with 5 molar eq of K3Fe(CN)6 and filtered over Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences). AHSP and αHb·AHSP complexes were prepared at ∼1 mm concentration in 10–20 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 6.9 (95% 1H2O and 5% 2H2O) and 2 μm 5,5-dimethylsilapentanesulfonate. Data were collected at 288 K (AHSP-(1–90)), 298 K (AHSP) and 303 K (αHb·AHSP complexes) on Bruker Avance 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers, processed in TOPSPIN (Bruker), and analyzed using SPARKY. 6T.

Crystals were grown at 4 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The well buffer contains 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 4% acetonitrile, and 14.5% (w/v) PEG3000. The crystals, with a typical dimension of 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.1 mm3, belong to the space group P6122 and contain two complexes per asymmetric unit. The unit cell has a dimension of a = b = 65.23 Å and c = 439.66 Å. Crystals were equilibrated in buffer containing 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 15% (w/v) PEG3000, and 21% (v/v) glycerol, and were flash frozen under a cold nitrogen stream.

The final refined atomic model, at 3.2 Å resolution, contains residues 1–91 of AHSP and residues 2–136 of αHb. Isothermal titration calorimetry was carried out on a MicroCal VP-ITC instrument in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 20 °C. Oxy-αHb, CO-αHb, or met-αHb (40–100 μm) was injected into AHSP (4–10 μm). Sucrose (0.45 m) was included in all buffers for titrations of met-αHb to inhibit precipitation. AHSP·αHb binding curves produced good fits to a simple 1:1 binding model using a non-linear least squares algorithm (supplemental Fig. S1). Conversion of αHb (10 μm) to bishis-αHb was measured by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy at 30 °C in the presence of a 1.2 molar excess of AHSP in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 10 μm diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid. After confirming the presence of isosbestic points in the spectra at 529 and 592 nm, the conversion rates were calculated by fitting the change in absorbance at 576 nm to a three-parameter exponential function. To investigate the function of Pro30 in AHSP, we generated a number of point mutants at this position and assayed their ability to convert oxy-αHb to the protective bis-histidyl form. As shown in Fig. 1B, the oxy-αHb·AHSP and bishis-αHb·AHSP complexes display characteristic visible absorption spectra that allow the conversion process to be conveniently monitored. A series of representative spectra obtained during conversion of oxy-αHb·AHSP are shown in Fig. 2A. Each spectrum can be fit as a sum of the pure oxy- and bishis-αHb·AHSP spectra, and the series displays isosbestic points at 529 and 592 nm. The change in absorbance at 576 nm was fit to a single exponential function (Fig. 2B, closed circles) to obtain a rate constant. In comparison to the oxy-αHb·AHSP complex, the spectra of oxy-αHb alone displayed only a minor change at 576 nm (Fig. 2B, open squares) and lacked the isosbestic points at 529 and 592 nm, indicating a process distinct from conversion to bis-histidyl αHb (precipitation was evident). Upon mutation of Pro30 to any of the residues Ala, Phe, Gly, Val, or Trp, we observed a ∼4-fold reduction in the rate constant (p < 0.001) (Table 1 and Fig. 2C, lanes 5–9). The same isosbestic points were observed in each reaction. In contrast, alanine mutations introduced at positions 29 or 31 had minor effects (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that efficient conversion of oxy-αHb is dependent on properties of the Pro30 residue that cannot be substituted by other residue types.TABLE 1αHb·AHSP interaction parametersAHSP sequenceAffinity constant(KD)aValues from single isothermal titration calorimetry experiments, with fitting errors for unweighted non-linear least squares regression analysis using MicroCal Origin software.

Open table in a new tab Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that most of the Pro30 mutants bound αHb more tightly than wild-type AHSP (Table 1), demonstrating that reduction in the αHb conversion rate did not correlate with the affinity of AHSP for αHb. These data suggest that Pro30 causes a comparative destabilization of the initial oxy-αHb·AHSP complex, while also lowering the activation barrier for conversion to bishis-αHb·AHSP. We also determined the affinity of wild-type AHSP or mutant AHSP-(P30A) for met-αHb, a pre-oxidized form of free αHb. We have previously shown that met-αHb reacts with AHSP to rapidly form bishis-αHb·AHSP, apparently without the formation of an intermediate complex (5Feng L. Gell D.A. Zhou S. Gu L. Kong Y. Li J. Hu M. Yan N. Lee C. Rich A.M. Armstrong R.S. Lay P.A. Gow A.J. Weiss M.J. Mackay J.P. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 119: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We found that the affinity of met-αHb for AHSP and AHSP-(P30A) is very similar (KD = 4.3 and 5.0 nm, respectively) (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that Pro30 does not significantly influence the thermodynamic stability of the final bis-histidyl complex. Introduction of the P30A mutation abrogates the cis/trans isomerization of AHSP, resulting in a trans Asp29-Ala30 peptide bond (5Feng L. Gell D.A. Zhou S. Gu L. Kong Y. Li J. Hu M. Yan N. Lee C.

The remaining Pro30 mutants also adopt a single conformation, assumed to be trans (as judged by one-dimensional NMR; data not shown), and all display a similar 4-fold reduction in activity. Prolyl cis/trans isomerization is known to modulate the function of numerous proteins (24Shaw P.E. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Lu K.P. Finn G. Lee T.H. Nicholson L.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the cis/trans conformation of the Asp29-Pro30 peptide bond might be important for AHSP function. To investigate this hypothesis, we made substitutions to amino acids surrounding Pro30. Previous work on peptides (33Grathwohl C. Wuthrich K. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 2623-2633Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 34Reimer U. Scherer G. Drewello M. Kruber S. Schutkowski M. Fischer G. J. Mol.

Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 1017-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) has established that the ratio of cis to trans prolyl conformers is strongly influenced by the identity of the preceding residue. We found that D29F and D29W mutations resulted in enhanced αHb conversion activity compared with wild-type AHSP (Fig. 2C). In contrast, D29A, L31A, and L31W mutations in AHSP had little effect on the αHb conversion rate. To control for effects of the D29W mutation that might be unrelated to its influence on the conformation of the Xaa29-Xaa30 peptide bond, we generated a double mutant, D29W,P30A. Significantly, this mutant had the same low activity as AHSP-(P30A) (Fig. 2C, lane 12), confirming that the stimulating effect of the D29W mutation relies upon the presence of Pro30. To investigate the structural consequences of these mutations, we assigned backbone 15N, HN, and 13Cα resonances for the D29A, D29F, D29W, L31A, and L31W mutants. All mutants displayed evidence of distinct cis/trans isomers (supplemental Fig. S2). To assign these isomers, we used proline side chain carbon resonances. The chemical shift difference δ(13Cβ)-δ(13Cγ) for proline is diagnostic for the conformation of the preceding peptide bond, with average values of 4.5 ± 1.2 and 9.6 ± 1.3 ppm (±1 S.D.) observed for trans and cis isomers, respectively (37Schubert M. Labudde D. Oschkinat H. Schmieder P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The relative abundances of the cis and trans isomers were then calculated from 15N-HSQC peak volumes. Overall, there was positive correlation between the fraction of cis peptide in free AHSP and the conversion rate of the corresponding oxy-αHb·AHSP complex (Fig. 2D). To gain insight into the function of AHSP Pro30 in oxy-αHb conversion, we carried out structural analyses of the initial oxy-αHb·AHSP and final bishis-αHb·AHSP complexes. Although free AHSP exists as a mixture of two conformers, only a single conformer can be detected in complex with αHb by NMR methods (5Feng L. Gell D.A. Zhou S. Gu L. Kong Y. Li J. Hu M. Yan N.

Using a construct of AHSP in which the C-terminal unstructured residues were deleted (AHSP residues 1–90; AHSP-(1–90)), we could obtain complete backbone and proline side chain carbon assignments in a complex with αHb. We confirmed that AHSP-(1–90), and mutants thereof, showed the same pattern of activity and conformational preference as the full-length proteins (Table 1 and Fig. 2, C and D). To prevent conversion of the initial αHb·AHSP complex to the bis-histidyl complex, we used carbonmonoxy-αHb (CO-αHb) in the place of oxy-αHb. Importantly, the 15N-HSQC spectra of CO-αHb·AHSP-(1–90) and oxy-αHb·AHSP-(1–90) are essentially identical (supplemental Fig. S3). The chemical shift difference δ(13Cβ)-δ(13Cγ) for Pro30 in the CO-αHb·AHSP-(1–90) complex was 9.3 ppm, indicating a cis Asp29-Pro30 conformation. In comparison, Pro60 and Pro80 yield values of 3.7 and 2.6 ppm, respectively, and are thus predicted to be in the trans-peptidyl conformation, consistent with our previous crystal structures (2Feng L. Zhou S. Gu L. Gell D.A. Mackay J.P. Weiss M.J. Gow A.J. Shi Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Feng L. Gell D.A. Zhou S. Gu L. Kong Y. Li J. Hu M. Yan N. Lee C.

A comparison of backbone chemical shifts between AHSP-(1–90) and AHSP-(1–90,P30A), both in complex with CO-αHb, reveals substantial differences in the conformation of loop 1 (Fig. 3A), consistent with the presence of a cis Asp29-Pro30 peptide bond in CO-αHb·AHSP-(1–90). To determine whether AHSP undergoes any conformation changes concomitant with αHb conversion, we incubated unlabeled oxy-αHb with 15N-labeled AHSP-(1–90) at 30 °C and recorded 15N-HSQC spectra at 22-min intervals for 18 h. The evolution of the final bishis-αHb·AHSP complex was confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy. Only small changes in the 15N-HSQC spectra were observed in this experiment (Fig. 3B, bars), indicating only minor changes in AHSP structure. These changes were much less pronounced than the differences between the cis/trans conformers of free AHSP-(1–90) (Fig. 3B, dashed line) or between the cis and trans conformations of AHSP-(1–90) and AHSP-(1–90,P30A) bound to CO-αHb (Fig. 3A). Backbone chemical shifts were also assigned for AHSP-(1–90,P30A), for which peptide bond isomerization has been shown not to occur (2Feng L. Zhou S. Gu L. Gell D.A. Mackay J.P. Weiss M.J. Gow A.J. Shi Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Feng L. Gell D.A. Zhou S. Gu L. Kong Y. Li J. Hu M. Yan N. Lee C. Rich A.M. Armstrong R.S. Lay P.A. Gow A.J. Weiss M.J. Mackay J.P. Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 119: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), in complex with CO-αHb and bishis-αHb. Small chemical shift differences were observed, and these were similar to those observed for AHSP-(1–90). Together, these data reveal that the structure of AHSP changes very little during αHb conversion, and that, in wild-type AHSP complexes, the Asp29-Pro30 peptide bond is likely to remain in a cis conformation throughout. To understand in more detail the influence of cis-peptidyl Pro30 on the structure and function of αHb·AHSP complexes, we turned to x-ray crystallography. Despite extensive efforts over three years, we were unable to produce crystals of oxy-αHb complexed with wild-type human AHSP. Finally, after screening ∼8,000 different conditions, we eventually generated small crystals of bishis-αHb·AHSP-(1–91). The structure of this complex was determined by molecular replacement and refined to a 3.2 Å resolution (Fig. 4 and supplemental Table S2). Aside from loop 1 of AHSP, the conformations of individual subunits within the bishis-αHb·AHSP-(1–91) complex are virtually identical to their counterparts in our previously determined structure of bishis-αHb·AHSP-(1–91,P30A) (Fig. 4), and the interaction interface comprises the same network of van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds as described for the earlier structure (2Feng L. Zhou S. Gu L. Gell D.A. Mackay J.P. Weiss M.J. Gow A.J. Shi Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, a"
https://openalex.org/W1965008796,"Mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein is a major contributor to tumor initiation and progression in several tumor types. These mutations affect APC function in the Wnt-beta-catenin signaling and influence mitotic spindle anchoring to the cell cortex and orientation. Here we report that the mitotic anchoring and orientation function of APC is regulated by cyclin A/cdk2. Knockdown of cyclin A and inhibition of cdk2 resulted in cells arrested in mitosis with activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. The mitotic spindle was unable to form stable attachments to the cell cortex, and this resulted in the spindles failing to locate to the central position in the cells and undergo dramatic rotation. We have demonstrated that cyclin A/cdk2 specifically associates with APC in late G2 phase and phosphorylates it at Ser-1360, located in the mutation cluster region of APC. Mutation of APC Ser-1360 to Ala results in identical off-centered mitotic spindles. Thus, this cyclin A/cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of APC affects astral microtubule attachment to the cortical surface in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1980782397,"The discovery that adult somatic cells can be induced to become pluripotent by overexpression of a few key transcription factors provides an exciting new window into the basic biology of pluripotency and differentiation. The discovery that adult somatic cells can be induced to become pluripotent by overexpression of a few key transcription factors provides an exciting new window into the basic biology of pluripotency and differentiation. The discovery 3 years ago that adult somatic cells can be induced to become pluripotent stem cells, so-called iPS cells, by overexpression of a few key transcription factors (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17010) Google Scholar) generated much excitement because of the potential therapeutic applications of these cells (reviewed in Yamanaka, 2009Yamanaka S. Cell. 2009; 137: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Efforts are underway in many laboratories to apply iPS cell technology to modeling diseases in vitro and to developing tissue-replacement therapies. To fulfill the therapeutic promise of iPS cells, a major research focus has been to improve the efficiency and completeness of reprogramming back to a pluripotent state. Other research avenues include finding ways to deliver the genes encoding the reprogramming factors without using viruses, thus avoiding the need for genomic integration, and compiling panels of iPS cells derived from patients with different diseases in order to drive their in vitro differentiation into the cell type affected in the disease. The generation of iPS cells, however, may also be valuable for gaining insights into the basic biology of pluripotency and differentiation. The mechanisms by which somatic cells are reprogrammed back to a pluripotent state are largely unknown. During the reprogramming process, cells often get “trapped” in partially reprogrammed states due to inefficient DNA demethylation or incomplete repression/ectopic expression of lineage-specific transcription factors (Mikkelsen et al., 2008Mikkelsen T.S. Hanna J. Zhang X. Ku M. Wernig M. Schorderet P. Bernstein B.E. Jaenisch R. Lander E.S. Meissner A. Nature. 2008; 454: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The contribution of each reprogramming factor is not well understood, but c-Myc is thought to act early to repress somatic cell genes (Sridharan et al., 2009Sridharan R. Tchieu J. Mason M.J. Yachechko R. Kuoy E. Horvath S. Zhou Q. Plath K. Cell. 2009; 136: 364-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Binding of the other three reprogramming factors—Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4—to pluripotency genes may be a later, rate-limiting step in the progression to complete reprogramming (Sridharan et al., 2009Sridharan R. Tchieu J. Mason M.J. Yachechko R. Kuoy E. Horvath S. Zhou Q. Plath K. Cell. 2009; 136: 364-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). These and other studies are beginning to reveal the mechanisms that underlie the induction of pluripotency (reviewed in Hochedlinger and Plath, 2009Hochedlinger K. Plath K. Development. 2009; 136: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). But can iPS cells provide insights into basic biology? Cells developing in vivo progress from undifferentiated states with broad cell-fate potential to committed states with restricted potential. Arguably, the generation of iPS cells represents an artificial experimental manipulation that “plays the development tape backwards” and therefore may not have a parallel in vivo. However, iPS cell generation may involve molecular processes that have parallels with fundamental events during mammalian development (Figure 1). One such event is the reprogramming of the gamete pronuclei at fertilization, which leads to initiation of the embryonic program. The DNA in the sperm pronucleus is highly compacted and undergoes decondensation and demethylation under the influence of oocyte intracellular factors. Some of these same factors, most of which are unknown, presumably also are involved in the reprogramming of adult cell nuclei by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). The mechanisms underlying SCNT have proven difficult to dissect, mostly because of the complexity and low reproducibility of the assay. Later in development, primordial germ cells (PGCs) also undergo a process of reprogramming that involves genome-wide demethylation of DNA and modification of histones. The generation of iPS cells from adult somatic cells involves extensive epigenetic reprogramming that includes chromatin decondensation and DNA demethylation. Epigenetic reprogramming during the generation of iPS cells may well be mediated by mechanisms very different from those that operate during in vivo reprogramming in either oocytes or PGCs, and this will need to be carefully assessed. However, should there be some molecular parallels between epigenetic reprogramming in vivo and iPS cell generation in vitro, then the latter may provide a particularly tractable genetic and biochemical system to dissect the underlying mechanisms. Unlike oocytes or PGCs, which exist in very limited numbers in vivo, large numbers of cells can be reprogrammed, in a quantitative and reproducible manner, to become iPS cells in vitro. The derivation of iPS cells also may be used to explore the molecular underpinnings of germ cell tumor development. The transcriptional profile of PGCs is similar to that of embryonic stem (ES) cells and includes expression of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and other pluripotency-associated factors. PGCs do not express c-Myc but do express high levels of another Myc family member, n-Myc, and n-Myc can substitute for c-Myc in the generation of iPS cells (Blelloch et al., 2007Blelloch R. Venere M. Yen J. Ramalho-Santos M. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 245-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). PGCs do not express Klf4, which is activated during conversion of PGCs to pluripotent stem cells in vitro. It will be interesting to determine whether acquisition of Klf4 expression, or other molecular events that occur during iPS cell generation, play any role in the transformation of PGCs and the development of germ cell tumors. The derivation of iPS cells may be viewed as a biochemical assay for pluripotency. It is reproducible, quantitative, and can be modulated by various conditions including the addition of cofactors (Figure 1). Genetic manipulation of the iPS cell assay—such as knockdown or overexpression of candidate genes in addition to or substituting for the four reprogramming factors—may allow questions to be asked about the molecular mechanisms that underlie pluripotency during normal embryonic development. The initial report of iPS cell generation (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17010) Google Scholar) provided an important basic insight into the transcriptional networks of pluripotency. Of the four factors used by Takahashi and Yamanaka, Klf4 was the most unexpected because it is not required for pluripotency. It is now known that a redundant network composed of Klf2, Klf4, and Klf5 is essential for ES cell pluripotency and regulates many of the same target genes as Nanog (Jiang et al., 2008Jiang J. Chan Y.S. Loh Y.H. Cai J. Tong G.Q. Lim C.A. Robson P. Zhong S. Ng H.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Also, an orphan nuclear receptor (estrogen-related receptor-β) required for ES cell self-renewal can substitute for c-Myc and Klf4 during the induction of pluripotency (Feng et al., 2009Feng B. Jiang J. Kraus P. Ng J.H. Heng J.C. Chan Y.S. Yaw L.P. Zhang W. Loh Y.H. Han J. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Thus, an interplay between research on iPS cells and ES cells may accelerate our understanding of the basic biology of pluripotency. Another area in which the iPS cell assay may provide fundamental insights is in microRNA (miRNA) biology. The miRNAs miR-291-3p, miR-294, and miR-295, which are expressed specifically in ES cells and regulate progression of ES cells through the cell cycle, enhance the efficiency of pluripotency induction (Judson et al., 2009Judson R.L. Babiarz J.E. Venere M. Blelloch R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Although it remains unclear whether these miRNAs have overlapping targets in ES cells and during reprogramming, the iPS cell assay provides a complementary approach for studying the biology of miRNAs associated with pluripotency. Recent data from our laboratory suggest that some of the mechanisms that maintain the open chromatin state of ES cells may also operate during the generation of iPS cells. Chd1, a chromatin-remodeling factor required for maintenance of open chromatin and pluripotency of ES cells, is also needed for the induction of pluripotency (Gaspar-Maia et al., 2009Gaspar-Maia A. Alajem A. Polesso F. Sridharan R. Mason M. Heidersbach A. Ramalho-Santos J. McManus M.T. Plath K. Meshorer E. Ramalho-Santos M. Nature. 2009; (Published online July 8, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08212Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Therefore, the iPS cell assay can provide opportunities to gain insights into the functions of transcription factors, miRNAs, and chromatin-remodeling factors in pluripotent cells. Analogous questions may be asked regarding the roles of signaling proteins, metabolic pathways, cell-cycle regulators, and cytoskeletal proteins in pluripotency. The iPS cell assay may be particularly useful as a gain-of-function assay in cases where loss of function of particular genes in early embryos or ES cells would provide only limited insight. For example, the cell-cycle and metabolic pathways of early embryos and ES cells have unique characteristics. Although loss-of-function approaches to analyze these characteristics may lead to lethality, the iPS cell assay enables their investigation during the reprogramming of somatic cells to the pluripotent state. Beyond addressing these questions, the iPS cell assay provides an opportunity for structure-function studies to identify the relevant protein domains or amino acids of a particular transcription factor, chromatin-remodeling protein, or signaling protein that may be involved in pluripotency. It is not that such studies are impossible in early embryos or in ES cells, but rather that the iPS cell assay provides a simple complementary approach with which to accelerate the mechanistic dissection of pluripotency. Finally, it may be possible to use variations of the iPS cell assay to gain insight into lineage commitment decisions. In a restricted number of cases, it is possible to convert one cell type into another by manipulating the expression of lineage-specific transcription factors (reviewed in Zhou and Melton, 2008Zhou Q. Melton D.A. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 382-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Knowledge gained about how cells change states during the generation of iPS cells—for example, how they alter chromatin accessibility or reprogram epigenetic marks—may contribute to a better understanding of lineage commitment and cell-fate switching. In addition to providing new insights into the regulation of the pluripotent state, the iPS cell assay may be a new tool to probe the molecular mechanisms that underlie the stability of the differentiated state (Figure 1). Developmental biologists have long pondered whether a terminally differentiated state is reversible and what locks that state in place. Indeed, this was the motivation behind the original SCNT experiments in amphibians (Gurdon, 1962Gurdon J.B. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1962; 10: 622-640PubMed Google Scholar). Many decades later, we still know little about the process of dedifferentiation, which may have important consequences for our understanding of cellular transformation and tumor development. Transformed cells may in some cases arise by dedifferentiation, that is, by losing markers of terminally differentiated cells and acquiring stem cell-like properties. The iPS cell assay may shed light on the genes and pathways that “lock-in” cells in the differentiated state enabling them to resist dedifferentiation. Inhibition of the tumor suppressor protein p53 facilitates the generation of iPS cells, suggesting that it represses dedifferentiation (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao Y. Yin X. Qin H. Zhu F. Liu H. Yang W. Zhang Q. Xiang C. Hou P. Song Z. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 475-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The iPS cell assay can be used to study how p53 modulates the stability of the differentiated state. Other tumor suppressors, such as Rb or Pten, are also candidate repressors of dedifferentiation that can be investigated using the iPS cell assay. Lineage-specific transcription factors and epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation or lack of H3K4 methylation at certain loci also may repress dedifferentiation (Mikkelsen et al., 2008Mikkelsen T.S. Hanna J. Zhang X. Ku M. Wernig M. Schorderet P. Bernstein B.E. Jaenisch R. Lander E.S. Meissner A. Nature. 2008; 454: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to test whether inhibition of miRNAs expressed in differentiated cells but not in stem cells, such as let-7, facilitates reprogramming. More broadly, it may be possible to apply the iPS cell assay to discover new genes that act as repressors of dedifferentiation in an unbiased way using, for example, large-scale RNAi screens. Screening for repressors of dedifferentiation using induction of pluripotency in different adult somatic cell types may reveal some genes that act universally to repress dedifferentiation, and others that regulate the stability of specific cell types. The transcriptional similarities between pluripotent stem cells and cancer cells (Wong et al., 2008Wong D.J. Liu H. Ridky T.W. Cassarino D. Segal E. Chang H.Y. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 333-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) suggest that the iPS cell assay may provide a new quantitative approach for investigating regulation of the differentiated cell state and how it may be subverted in cancer. Some of these research avenues make the assumption that the same mechanisms that implement pluripotency in vivo or in ES cells operate during the generation of iPS cells in vitro. This may not necessarily be so, as exemplified by the case of Mbd3, a subunit of the NuRD transcriptional repressor complex. Mouse blastocysts lacking the Mbd3 gene cannot give rise to ES cells but, when both alleles are mutated by gene targeting in preexisting ES cells, Mbd3 is not required for ES cell maintenance and propagation (Kaji et al., 2006Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). That is to say, Mbd3 is required for reprogramming of the inner cell mass of the embryo to the ES cell state, but not for maintenance of ES cells. It will be interesting to see if analogous examples of differences between reprogramming and pluripotency can be identified using the iPS cell assay. Presumably, there will be mechanistic similarities between the two phenomena. A further caveat is that often reprogramming during iPS cell generation is incomplete and may not faithfully reproduce reprogramming in vivo or the pluripotent state of ES cells. The presence of incompletely reprogrammed iPS cell colonies, coupled with the low efficiency of iPS cell generation, means that there is significant cell heterogeneity during reprogramming, with properly reprogrammed iPS cells constituting a small minority of the somatic cells treated with reprogramming factors. This is further complicated by the time it takes to observe iPS cell colonies after induction of pluripotency, which varies from 7 to 14 days in mouse cells and 14 to 28 days in human cells. These complications constitute a “black box” in which the intermediate stages of reprogramming are difficult to access. Nevertheless, current reprogramming efficiencies allow the use of end-point data, that is, the number of iPS cells properly reprogrammed can be assayed through the expression of reporter genes in a quantitative manner. Further improvements in the extent and efficiency of pluripotency induction (Yamanaka, 2009Yamanaka S. Cell. 2009; 137: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar and references therein) will facilitate the use of iPS cells in basic biology studies. In addition, the development of readouts for early stages of reprogramming may allow the process of iPS cell generation to be visualized and studied in real-time. In summary, knowledge of the basic biology of pluripotency in early embryos and ES cells paved the way for the discovery of iPS cells. The interplay between iPS and ES cell research extends beyond technical improvements to the method of iPS cell generation and is providing new insights into the regulation of pluripotency. The iPS cell assay is a new quantitative tool to study the basic biology of reprogramming in vivo and to dissect the regulation of both the pluripotent and the differentiated cell state. The iPS cell assay should make important contributions to developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and cancer biology. I thank the Santos lab, R. Blelloch, J. Ramalho-Santos, M. Conti, B.

https://openalex.org/W1992003240,"The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored prion protein (PrPC), usually associated with neurodegenerative diseases, modulates various cellular responses and may scaffold multiprotein cell surface signaling complexes. Engagement of PrPC with the secret-able cochaperone hop/STIl induces neurotrophic transmembrane signals through unknown molecular mecha-nisms. We addressed whether interaction of PrPC and hop/STIl entails structural rearrangements relevant for signaling. Using recombinant wild-type and mutant mouse proteins and binding peptides, we measured circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy, and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). PrPC:hop/STll interaction triggers loss of PrP helical structures, involving at least a perturbation of the PrP143-153 α-helix, but no secondary structural modification of hop/STIl was detected. Novel SAXS models revealed a significant C-terminal compaction of hop/STIl when bound to PrP. Differing from a recent dimeric model of human hop/STIl, both size-exclusion chromatography and SAXS data support a monomeric form of free murine hop/STIl. Changes in the PrP143-153 α-helix, may engage the transmembrane signaling proteins laminin receptor precursor and neural cell adhesion molecule, both of which bind that domain of PrPC, and further ligands may be engaged by the tertiary structural changes of hop/STI1. These reciprocal structural modifications indicate a versatile mechanism for signaling mediated by PrPC:hop/STI1 interaction, consistent with the hypothesis of PrPC-dependent multiprotein signaling complexes.—Romano, S.

https://openalex.org/W1988174694,"ABSTRACT Native GABAA channels display a single-channel conductance ranging between ~10 and 90 pS. Diazepam increases the conductance of some of these native channels but never those of recombinant receptors, unless they are coexpressed with GABARAP. This trafficking protein clusters recombinant receptors in the membrane, suggesting that high-conductance channels arise from receptors that are at locally high concentrations. The amphipathic (MA) helix that is present in the large cytoplasmic loop of every subunit of all ligand-gated ion channels mediates protein-protein interactions. Here we report that when applied to inside-out patches, a peptide mimicking the MA helix of the γ2 subunit (γ381-403) of the GABAA receptor abrogates the potentiating effect of diazepam on both endogenous receptors and recombinant GABAA receptors co-expressed with GABARAP, by substantially reducing their conductance. The protein interaction disrupted by the peptide did not involve GABARAP, because a shorter peptide (γ386-403) known to compete with the γ2-GABARAP interaction did not affect the conductance of recombinant αβγ receptors coexpressed with GABARAP. The requirement for receptor clustering and the fact that the γ2 MA helix is able to self-associate support a mechanism whereby adjacent GABAA receptors interact via their γ2-subunit MA helices, altering ion permeation through each channel. Alteration of ion-channel function arising from dynamic interactions between ion channels of the same family has not been reported previously and highlights a novel way in which inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain may be differentially modulated.— Everitt, A. B., Seymour, V. A. L., Curmi, J., Laver, D. R., Gage, P. W., Tierney, M. L. Protein interactions involving the γ2 large cytoplasmic loop of GABAA receptors modulate conductance.

https://openalex.org/W2083516739,"Ubiquitination-mediated degradation of the RelA subunit of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is critical for the termination of NF-kappaB activation. However, the precise mechanism for the ubiquitination of RelA is still not fully understood. Here we report that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) induces RelA polyubiquitination at the lysine 195 residue, and this ubiquitination event is critical for the degradation of RelA and termination of TNFalpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Overexpression of a RelA mutant with an arginine substitution for the lysine 195 residue dramatically inhibits RelA polyubiquitination and induces a stronger NF-kappaB activation compared with the wild type. Reconstitution of RelA-deficient mouse embryo fibroblast cells with wild-type RelA or RelA containing a K195R mutation revealed the importance of this site in TNFalpha-mediated RelA polyubiquitination, degradation, and attenuation of NF-kappaB activation. Our finding is the first report that substitution of a key RelA lysine residue with arginine inhibits TNFalpha-induced RelA ubiquitination and enhances TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation."

https://openalex.org/W1984950139,"The multicellular behavior of the myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus requires the participation of an elevated number of signal-transduction mechanisms to coordinate the cell movements and the sequential changes in gene expression patterns that lead to the morphogenetic and differentiation events. These signal-transduction mechanisms are mainly based on two-component systems and on the reversible phosphorylation of protein targets mediated by eukaryotic-like protein kinases and phosphatases. Among all these factors, protein phosphatases are the elements that remain less characterized. Hence, we have studied in this work the physiological role and biochemical activity of the protein phosphatase of the family PPP (phosphoprotein phosphatases) designated as Pph2, which is forming part of the same operon as the two-component system phoPR1. We have demonstrated that this operon is induced upon starvation in response to the depletion of the cell energy levels. The increase in the expression of the operon contributes to an efficient use of the scarce energy resources available for developing cells to ensure the completion of the life cycle. In fact, a Deltapph2 mutant is defective in aggregation, sporulation yield, morphology of the myxospores, and germination efficiency. The yeast two-hybrid technology has shown that Pph2 interacts with the gene products of MXAN_1875 and 5630, which encode a hypothetical protein and a glutamine synthetase, respectively. Because Pph2 exhibits Ser/Thr, and to some extent Tyr, Mn(2+)-dependent protein phosphatase activity, it is expected that this function is accomplished by dephosphorylation of the specific protein substrates."
