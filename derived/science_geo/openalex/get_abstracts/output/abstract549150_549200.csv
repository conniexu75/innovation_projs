https://openalex.org/W2210396547,"Changes in pupil diameter that reflect effort and other cognitive factors are often interpreted in terms of the activity of norepinephrine-containing neurons in the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC), but there is little direct evidence for such a relationship. Here, we show that LC activation reliably anticipates changes in pupil diameter that either fluctuate naturally or are driven by external events during near fixation, as in many psychophysical tasks. This relationship occurs on as fine a temporal and spatial scale as single spikes from single units. However, this relationship is not specific to the LC. Similar relationships, albeit with delayed timing and different reliabilities across sites, are evident in the inferior and superior colliculus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. Because these regions are interconnected with the LC, the results suggest that non-luminance-mediated changes in pupil diameter might reflect LC-mediated coordination of neuronal activity throughout some parts of the brain."

Here we found that the mutation of FRMD7, a gene that is defective in human congenital nystagmus, leads to the selective loss of the horizontal optokinetic reflex in mice, as it does in humans. This is accompanied by the selective loss of horizontal direction selectivity in retinal ganglion cells and the transition from asymmetric to symmetric inhibitory input to horizontal direction-selective ganglion cells. In wild-type retinas, we found FRMD7 specifically expressed in starburst amacrine cells, the interneuron type that provides asymmetric inhibition to direction-selective retinal ganglion cells. This work identifies FRMD7 as a key regulator in establishing a neuronal circuit asymmetry, and it suggests the involvement of a specific inhibitory neuron type in the pathophysiology of a neurological disease.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIzMmUzNGJkNWNlNDFiZDEyNzJiYThlZDEzMzdkMTU1MCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NjUxMTk0fQ.c7cbIpedz5yPxIls2CJule0S7s6X07WWKZAWW5_ordQ9xIgRHZwKIH3L1LsPim7D3ZdOUHyIu2CI1Ub7QaxeGVUcSenZXjDHETUUra1xVz2f_HgGO8UHUgnuBirxb75GxNOka35b4u2G57Q6jiyu3X8emPXluNYdGbVDNDAuJuedSAoZbkaxut5PQs3W6W1HLuiB04Wfa5If5fSqeZnY_rBEcsww7nAnRqHvVKAKX8i7x93F_jjt-UFu0iX1EByCmWT8j_jBO08kCtmNrJ_qVPTnC0Kr8v1hFcEVKYHgJuwmw3VHjxhCLTokdwqkuUmJWpKp_dUeHFNjmi4vR_gbaQ(mp4, (47.53 MB) Download video"

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are characterized by biological properties similar to mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) but distinct from inner cell mass-like (ICM-like) “naïve” mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (Mascetti and Pedersen, 2014Mascetti V.L. Pedersen R.A. Naiveté of the human pluripotent stem cell.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As such, hPSCs represent an epithelial epiblast-like state of pluripotency (Krtolica et al., 2007Krtolica A. Genbacev O. Escobedo C. Zdravkovic T. Nordstrom A. Vabuena D. Nath A. Simon C. Mostov K.

Interestingly, epithelial epiblast-like PSCs (such as mEpiSCs, hESCs, and hiPSCs), unlike their ICM-like counterparts (e.g., mESCs and miPSCs), are barely able to form preimplantation chimeras (James et al., 2006James D.

However, mEpiSCs, which resemble the post-implantation epiblast, instead form chimeras with the post-implantation mouse embryo (Huang et al., 2012Huang Y. Osorno R. Tsakiridis A. Wilson V.

This raises a pivotal question: are hPSCs capable of forming an interspecies chimera by integrating into the post-implantation mouse embryo? Based on these prior observations, we hypothesized that stage-matching hPSCs with their appropriate embryonic context would hold the key to unlocking chimeric competency. The epithelial epiblast-like phenotype of hPSCs, similar in nature to mEpiSCs, led us to predict that hPSCs would be able to form a chimera with the gastrula-stage mouse embryo. To test this idea, we transplanted three hiPSC and two hESC lines (together, hPSCs), each transfected with a fluorescent reporter gene, into early and late gastrula-stage mouse embryos at the primitive streak or distal tip of the epiblast (Figure 1A). We found highly efficient interspecies chimera formation in all transplant sites ranging from 70% to 100% of transplanted embryos following in vitro culture (Figure 1B). (Embryos were obtained and cultured under University ethical review according to UK animal regulations; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.) We also transplanted mEpiSCs in a similar manner as a positive control for a putative interspecies barrier and saw similar incorporation (data not shown). Classical fate mapping studies have established an experimental platform for assessing normal cellular participation during embryo development (Tam, 1989Tam P.P. Regionalisation of the mouse embryonic ectoderm: allocation of prospective ectodermal tissues during gastrulation.Development. 1989; 107: 55-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Lawson et al., 1991Lawson K.A. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Clonal analysis of epiblast fate during germ layer formation in the mouse embryo.Development. 1991; 113: 891-911PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, using these insights we developed a comprehensive allocation map that predicts the distribution of hPSC progeny from the transplantation site (primitive streak or distal) and stage (early gastrula or late gastrula) to seven subregional locations (Figure 1C). Together these subregions constitute the building blocks of the developing fetus, and contribution to them achieves embryonic, or primary, chimerism (McLaren, 1976McLaren A. Mammalian Chimaeras. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1976Google Scholar). We hypothesized that subregional cell fate could be used as a metric for normal participation of hPSCs during chimeric embryo development. We found that both hiPSC and hESC descendants had the capacity to colonize each of the subregions in the developing fetus during culture (Figure 1D). This ability of hPSCs to contribute to all subregions of the developing fetus is consistent with the classical definition of pluripotency. We also used specific prediction of graft allocation based on gastrula stage at transplantation to assay normal development of hPSC transplants in both early and late gastrulating embryos (Figure 1E). We found that subregional distribution of graft progeny was significantly different in early versus late gastrula primitive streak (PS) transplants for both hiPSCs and hESCs (hiPSC: X2, p = 0; hESC: X2, p = 0). Moreover, this significant difference was observed in each individual transplanted cell line, and we found no significant difference in graft progeny subregional distribution when comparing cell lines to each other (Table S1). More specifically, a comparison of gastrula transplant outcomes revealed that hPSCs transplanted to the early gastrula PS contributed significantly more to early patterned tissues (Anterior ventral, Trunk ventral, Posterior ventral, Extra-embryonic) when compared to later patterned tissues (Trunk dorsal, Trunk ventral, Posterior dorsal, Extra-embryonic) (hiPSC: X2, p = 0.006; hESC: X2, p = 0.003). The converse is also true: late tissue outcomes were predominantly derived from late gastrula PS transplants (hiPSC: X2, p = 7.4 × 10−7; hESC: X2, p = 0). These outcomes are propelled by the differences between total ventral and dorsal tissue allocation at gastrula stages: comparison of hPSCs transplanted to early versus late gastrula PS revealed a highly significant shift from ventral to dorsal fates as gastrulation progressed (hiPSC: X2, p = 1.6 × 10−4; hESC: X2, p = 0), as calculated by summing ventral and dorsal fates for all regions (anterior, trunk, posterior). More specifically, we observed a shift from Trunk ventral to Trunk dorsal (hiPSC: X2, p = 0.000362; hESC: X2, p = 1 × 10−8) and Posterior ventral to Posterior dorsal (hiPSC: X2, p = 7 × 10−7; hESC: X2, p = 9.19 × 10−6), but not Anterior ventral to Anterior dorsal, when comparing early to late gastrula PS transplants. Distal transplants did not significantly differ in relation to the gastrula stage of recipient embryos, as expected from predictive fate mapping, so we grouped distal transplants to the early and late gastrula for analysis. Subregional distribution of graft progeny from distal transplants differed significantly from PS transplants for both hiPSCs and hESCs (hiPSC: X2, p = 0.0107; hESC: X2, p = 4 × 10−8). More specifically, this is reflected in the divide between distal patterned tissues (Anterior dorsal, Anterior ventral) and PS patterned tissues (Anterior ventral-EG, Trunk dorsal, Trunk ventral, Posterior dorsal, Posterior ventral) (hiPSC: X2, p = 0.0132; hESC: X2, p = 2.66 × 10−4). The hPSC patterning observed here reflects the progressive allocation of transplanted mEpiSCs (data not shown), resident epiblast descendants (Lawson et al., 1991Lawson K.A. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Clonal analysis of epiblast fate during germ layer formation in the mouse embryo.Development. 1991; 113: 891-911PubMed Google Scholar), and orthotopic gastrula transplantations (Tam and Zhou, 1996Tam P.P. Zhou S.X. The allocation of epiblast cells to ectodermal and germ-line lineages is influenced by the position of the cells in the gastrulating mouse embryo.Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, Kinder et al., 1999Kinder S.J. Tsang T.E. Quinlan G.A. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Tam P.P. The orderly allocation of mesodermal cells to the extraembryonic structures and the anteroposterior axis during gastrulation of the mouse embryo.Development. 1999; 126: 4691-4701PubMed Google Scholar). Comparing hPSC allocation and differentiation capacity with the intricate process of gastrulation, as previously established by classical fate mapping, provides a rigorous challenge of human stem cell pluripotency. Hence predictive fate, established independently, can be used to evaluate whether transplanted cells behave normally. Based on that assessment, the hPSC fates we observed not only confirm the integration of hPSCs into the developing fetus but also indicate formation of a developmentally normal interspecies chimera. Strikingly, hPSC graft progeny, whether from early or late gastrula PS or distal sites, were frequently dispersed throughout and across embryonic subregions. This distribution reflects the normal dispersion of epiblast descendants during gastrulation and thus is evidence not only of cell integration but also of normal development (Lawson et al., 1991Lawson K.A. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Clonal analysis of epiblast fate during germ layer formation in the mouse embryo.Development. 1991; 113: 891-911PubMed Google Scholar). Graft progeny dispersion, quantified as one-dimensional linear distance, averaged 963 μm and 1,171 μm for hiPSC and hESC transplants, respectively (Figure 2A), indicating extensive chimeric contribution. Graft progeny dispersion was also extensive in relation to embryonic rostro-caudal length whereby graft progeny colonized over one-fourth of the host embryo length in 70% of hiPSC chimeras and 77% of hESC chimeras (Figures 2B and 2C). We also quantified the cell area covered by dispersed graft progeny (Figure 2D). Total estimated graft cell number (Figures 2E and 2F) indicated that transplanted donor cells (∼10) proliferated extensively (hiPSC: mean = 70; hESC: mean = 64). Estimated cell numbers overlapped the ranges found for orthotopic transplants of comparable numbers of embryonic epiblast cells (proximal transplants, 70–77 cells /embryo; Tam and Zhou, 1996Tam P.P. Zhou S.X. The allocation of epiblast cells to ectodermal and germ-line lineages is influenced by the position of the cells in the gastrulating mouse embryo.Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and for orthotopic transplants of PS cells (33–78 cells/embryo; Kinder et al., 1999Kinder S.J. Tsang T.E. Quinlan G.A. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Tam P.P. The orderly allocation of mesodermal cells to the extraembryonic structures and the anteroposterior axis during gastrulation of the mouse embryo.Development. 1999; 126: 4691-4701PubMed Google Scholar). For the purposes of dispersion analysis, we quantified the number of separate cell clusters, as distinct from a single cluster (which could result from formation of an intra-embryonic teratoma by aberrant cell growth). Multiple (≥2), dispersed clusters were the predominant outcome in both early and late gastrula transplants for both hiPSCs (96%) and hESCs (91%) and for individual cell lines (Figures S2A and S2B). We also found no significant difference in graft progeny dispersion metrics when comparing hPSC cell type (hiPSC versus hESC) or transplant sites (Early gastrula versus Late gastrula versus Distal). Thus, we conclude that transplanted hPSCs and their progeny proliferate and contribute normally to the developing embryo, irrespective of transplant stage, site, or cell type. Confirming the localization and dispersion analysis, hiPSC and hESC graft progeny differentiated into endoderm, mesoderm, or ectoderm as shown by marker gene expression. We found that transplanted hiPSCs and hESCs co-expressed markers of the tissue in which they resided (hiPSC: Figures 2G–2N; hESC: Figures 2O–2V), indicating that they have undergone location-appropriate rather than random differentiation. Graft progeny located outside the antibody-designated tissue regions did not express the marker proteins, again showing that they were not randomly differentiated. Marker staining therefore also supports our conclusions that transplanted hiPSCs and hESCs differentiate to the phenotype corresponding to their local environment. In summary, we have shown that stage-matching PSC types with their appropriate embryonic context can overcome barriers to chimeric competency. Our approach was based on a prediction that epithelial epiblast-like hPSCs would integrate efficiently into gastrula-stage embryos. This stage-matching concept explains the diversity of chimeric outcomes seen in previous studies. ICM-like mESCs, mouse iPSCs, rat iPSCs, and naive-like monkey ESCs form preimplantation chimeras (Bradley et al., 1984Bradley A. Evans M. Kaufman M.H. Robertson E.

However, epithelial epiblast-like hPSCs do not share this preimplantation chimeric competency, as shown in a recent report assessing hPSCs as non-chimera-forming cells (Masaki et al., 2015Masaki H. Kato-Itoh M. Umino A. Sato H. Hamanaka S. Kobayashi T. Yamaguchi T. Nishimura K. Ohtaka M. Nakanishi M. Nakauchi H. Interspecific in vitro assay for the chimera-forming ability of human pluripotent stem cells.Development. 2015; 142: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), likely because they represent a post-implantation cellular phenotype (Mascetti and Pedersen, 2014Mascetti V.L. Pedersen R.A. Naiveté of the human pluripotent stem cell.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we found that when stage-matched to the epiblast of the gastrulating embryo, mEpiSCs (data not shown; Huang et al., 2012Huang Y. Osorno R. Tsakiridis A. Wilson V.

Most importantly, our findings in conjunction with previous studies indicate that chimeric competency relies on pairing in vitro derived cells with their in vivo counterpart. Moreover, while alternative human pluripotent states may be demonstrable in vitro, if they are not as chimera competent as shown herein, our findings imply that they are either not in fact pluripotent or they have not been matched to the correct stage of embryonic development. We would therefore argue that their relevance remains inconclusive without confirmation of their contribution to organized in vivo differentiation in the context of normal embryogenesis. In this regard, our findings are distinct from a recent paper by Wu et al., which states that H9-hESCs do not integrate into the post-implantation mouse embryo (Wu et al., 2015Wu J. Okamura D. Li M. Suzuki K. Luo C. Ma L. He Y. Li Z. Benner C. Tamura I. et al.An alternative pluripotent state confers interspecies chimaeric competency.Nature. 2015; 521: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). By contrast, we found highly efficient engraftment and extensive dispersion of graft progeny in each of the five hPSC lines transplanted, regardless of transplantation site (PS or distal tip), with integration and location-appropriate differentiation. The hESC mean linear dispersion that we observed was 40-fold and 84-fold greater for distal transplants, and 39-fold and 5-fold greater for LG-PS transplants than described by Wu et al. for H9-hESC and region selective-hESC dispersion, respectively. The technical challenges of the experimental system may be contributing factors in the disparity of the results. It is also possible that a “region-selective” cell type with restricted capacity is not in fact fully pluripotent, but instead is a partially differentiated cell that has been transplanted to its own permissive stage and location-matched environment. Our demonstration that hPSCs contribute to multiple tissue layers reveals their in vivo pluripotency. This key observation has been lacking from previous in vitro assays, teratoma studies, and biased in vivo contribution, all of which are limited by their lack of organized tissue context and thus likely harbor artifacts. Evidence for hPSC pluripotency from in vitro differentiation and teratoma assays has been used to ascribe pluripotent status to both hPSCs and EpiSCs. Our approach goes beyond those assays by providing evidence for the capacity of hPSCs to participate in normal organized tissue development in an embryonic context. Contribution to terminally differentiated tissues would not be expected in the assay within the timeframe of embryo culture. Instead, the strength of our functional evidence for hPSC pluripotency is underpinned by normal mouse embryo development during this period (Figure S1). Our in vivo validation of hPSC developmental competency therefore provides a more rigorous demonstration of hPSC pluripotency than has been possible from prior approaches. Moreover, our approach also confirms the capacity of hPSCs to participate in the intricately choreographed events of gastrulation by replicating the embryo’s own pluripotent cell migration and acquisition of specialized phenotypes. This also reveals that human pluripotent cells are able to correctly respond to the complex and progressively changing “permissive/stage-matched” signaling environment in which they reside after chimeric transplantation. As such, chimera competency with post-implantation mouse embryos underscores hPSC relevance for modeling human gastrulation in vitro, a developmental stage that would otherwise be inaccessible in vivo. Reciprocally, by mimicking the cues of gastrulation, we are able to extrapolate the conditions that pattern PSCs to specific tissue types in vitro (Mendjan et al., 2014Mendjan S. Mascetti V.L. Ortmann D. Ortiz M. Karjosukarso D.W. Ng Y. Moreau T. Pedersen R.A. NANOG and CDX2 pattern distinct subtypes of human mesoderm during exit from pluripotency.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 310-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In sum, faithful recapitulation of tissue-specific chimeric fate provides in vivo functional validation for human stem cell pluripotency. Our work provides evidence that hPSCs are not an artifact of culture and further endorses their utility as a bona fide resource for regenerative medicine.

Visuo-tactile cross-modal associations in cortical somatosensory cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 9777-9782Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Zhou and Fuster, 2004Zhou Y.D. Fuster J.M. Somatosensory cell response to an auditory cue in a haptic memory task.Behav. Brain Res. 2004; 153: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, during the sequential comparison of flutter stimuli, S1 and the auditory cortex (A1) encode only their corresponding principal modalities, and do so only during the stimulation periods of the discrimination task, not during the delay (Lemus et al., 2010Lemus L. Hernández A. Luna R. Zainos A. Romo R. Do sensory cortices process more than one sensory modality during perceptual judgments?.Neuron. 2010; 67: 335-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These results suggest that working memory is maintained outside the primary sensory cortices. But, again, where and how? Are the two sensory modalities encoded in working memory by the same group of neurons or by distinct, modality-specific groups? And how similar are the neural codes for the two modalities? We address these questions by recording from single neurons in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), an area engaged in perceptual judgments (Hernández et al., 2002Hernández A. Zainos A. Romo R. Temporal evolution of a decision-making process in medial premotor cortex.Neuron. 2002; 33: 959-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, Hernández et al., 2010Hernández A.

Decoding a perceptual decision process across cortex.Neuron. 2010; 66: 300-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), while trained monkeys discriminated, on interleaved trials, either two vibrotactile flutter stimuli, two acoustic flutter stimuli, or two cross-modal stimuli. We find that, during the delay period of the task, the firing rates of single pre-SMA neurons vary as monotonic functions of stimulus frequency, both for tactile and acoustic flutter. This capacity is subserved by a majority of bimodal and a minority of modality-specific neurons. The results show that single pre-SMA neurons use the same code for storing tactile and acoustic information in working memory. Such modality independence suggests a high degree of functional specialization for this area. As far as we know, this is the first demonstration of the existence of a supramodal (modality-independent or amodal) neural code for short-term memory representations. During the flutter discrimination task (Figure 1A), monkeys pay attention to the first stimulus frequency (f1, A = acoustic flutter [red]; f1, T = vibrotactile flutter [blue]), store a trace of it during the delay between the two stimuli, and compare the stored trace (f1) to the second stimulus (f2, A = acoustic flutter [red]; f2, T = vibrotactile flutter [blue]). This is a working memory task, in the sense that it requires memorization of a continuous parameter, stimulus frequency, a scalar, analog value induced either via a tactile or an acoustic sensation. After the first stimulus and the delay, the task requires an ordinal comparison of the remembered value to a second frequency value (also induced by a tactile or an acoustic sensation). That is, the subject reports whether f2 > f1 or f2 < f1. Two monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were trained to discriminate, on randomly interleaved trials, either two tactile flutter stimuli (Figure 1B), two acoustic flutter stimuli (Figure 1C), or cross-modal stimuli. In the latter case, either f1 was tactile and f2 acoustic (Figure 1D), or vice versa (Figure 1E). The success rates of the monkeys, measured as percentages of correct discriminations, were highly consistent across all of these conditions (Figures 1B–1E, numbers in boxes). Notably, because we used a fixed delay period of 3 s between the two stimuli, monkeys could anticipate the time of delivery of f2, but not its sensory modality (p = 0.5). Also, the probability that f2 could be judged higher or lower than f1 was 0.5 for all trials (Figures 1B–1E). The pre-SMA contains neurons that vary their activity during the delay period between two vibrotactile stimuli (Hernández et al., 2002Hernández A. Zainos A. Romo R.

For such neurons, the firing rate during the delay either increases (positive monotonic encoding) or decreases (negative monotonic encoding) monotonically as a function of f1 frequency. This encoding was suggested to be the key representation of vibrotactile stimulus frequency during the working memory component of this task (Romo et al., 1999Romo R. Brody C.D. Hernández A. Lemus L.

Here, we address the question of whether single pre-SMA neurons have the capacity to encode more than one sensory modality during the delay interval. We recorded from 205 neurons in pre-SMA (Figure 1F) while monkeys discriminated the stimulus combinations shown in Figures 1A–1E. One hundred and eighty three neurons (89% of the 205) changed their average firing rates during the task (Data Analysis in Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Out of the 183 recorded neurons judged to have task-related responses, 96 (52.5%) were found, based on off-line statistical tests (Data Analysis in Supplemental Experimental Procedures), to have discharge rates that varied monotonically with f1 frequency during the delay period, either for the tactile or acoustic flutter stimuli (inset of Figure 1F). This was determined by calculating the significant monotonic signal (slope different from zero, p < 0.01, for either a linear or sigmoidal fit with Q > 0.05; Data Analysis in Supplemental Experimental Procedures) in a time window of 200 ms displaced every 20 ms (Romo et al., 1999Romo R. Brody C.D. Hernández A. Lemus L. Neuronal correlates of parametric working memory in the prefrontal cortex.Nature. 1999; 399: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, Romo et al., 2002Romo R. Hernández A. Zainos A.

Decoding a perceptual decision process across cortex.Neuron. 2010; 66: 300-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Ninety four percent of the time the neuronal firing rate was described as a linear function of the f1 frequency, whereas the rest of the time it was described as a “hard” sigmoid function of f1 frequency (Romo et al., 1999Romo R. Brody C.D. Hernández A. Lemus L. Neuronal correlates of parametric working memory in the prefrontal cortex.Nature. 1999; 399: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). As found previously, during discrimination of tactile stimuli, firing rates varied monotonically with stimulus frequency during the f1 and delay periods of the task (Figure 2, left). Crucially, however, the current experiment showed that the same neurons were also sensitive to acoustic stimuli (Figure 2, right), and that their encoding was congruent across modalities. That is, single bimodal neurons had similar positive (Figure 2, top) or negative (Figure 2, bottom) monotonic dependencies on f1 frequency for the two modalities. We found that the large majority of the neurons that showed significant monotonic encoding were bimodal (84 out of 96 neurons, 87.5%), whereas few neurons were modality-specific (7 out of 96 were tactile, 7.3%; 5 out of 96 neurons were acoustic, 5.2%). To figure out if the proportion of bimodal neurons (45.9%; 84 out of the 183 task-related responses) is higher than those expected by chance, we determined separately the proportion of tuned neurons by each of the two modalities (tactile, 47.5% [87 of the 183]; acoustic, 45.3% [83 of the 183]). This means that, by chance, we could expect 21.54% (0.475 ∗ 0.453 = 0.215) of the neurons with bimodal responses, which is less than half of the proportion of neurons that we found. Also, both bimodal and modality-specific neurons could be sorted out according to the sign of the f1 encoding: either positive monotonic (n = 40, 41.7%; bimodal, n = 37, 92.5%; modality-specific: tactile, n = 2, 5%; acoustic, n = 1, 2.5%) or negative monotonic (n = 53, 55.2%; bimodal, n = 44, 83%; modality specific: tactile, n = 5, 9.4%; acoustic, n = 4, 7.6%). A minority of the neurons (2 out of 96, 2%) changed their dependency on f1 during the delay period, from positive to negative monotonic (n = 1, 1%) or vice versa (n = 1, 1%). Furthermore, only one neuron had a significant positive signal for one modality and a significant negative signal for the other at any point during the delay, so the coding of tactile and acoustic information was highly consistent. The majority of the monotonic responses began during the f1 stimulation period, and we calculated their latencies for both the tactile and acoustic flutter stimuli (Hernández et al., 2010Hernández A. Nácher V. Luna R. Zainos A. Lemus L. Alvarez M. Vázquez Y. Camarillo L. Romo R. Decoding a perceptual decision process across cortex.Neuron. 2010; 66: 300-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The mean monotonic response latency was 346.2 ± 81.9 ms (standard deviation [SD] for tactile [n = 42] and 344.2 ± 77.6 ms [SD] for acoustic stimuli [n = 33]), and there was no significant difference across the two sensory modalities (Wilcoxon, p = 0.98; Siegel and Castellan, 1988Siegel S. Castellan N.J. Nonparametric Statistics for Behavioral Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1988Google Scholar). Thus, in general, the same neurons encode the f1 stimulus frequency for tactile and acoustic stimuli, and did so in qualitatively the same way. The strength of the encoded stimulus signal was not static during the delay period of the task (Figure 3A). For each of the 96 neurons, we determined the times during which the dependence of firing rate on stimulus frequency was significant (Romo et al., 1999Romo R. Brody C.D. Hernández A. Lemus L. Neuronal correlates of parametric working memory in the prefrontal cortex.Nature. 1999; 399: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), either for the tactile (Figure 3, blue) stimuli, the acoustic (Figure 3, red), or both (Figure 3, gray). Most neurons were tuned to f1 frequency only during a fraction of the delay interval, so relatively few of them carried a significant signal throughout the full delay (Figures 3A and 3B). Those that did, however, were almost purely bimodal (Figure 3B). Although some neurons switched back and forth between bimodal and modality-specific during the 3 s delay, the bimodal responses were always the most common at any given time (Figures 3B and 3C), and their predominance increased toward the end of the delay; that is, most of the neurons became bimodal during the period immediately before f2 delivery (Figures 3A and 3C). Furthermore, the strength of the activity tuned to f1 frequency (as measured by ||slope||, Data Analysis in Supplemental Experimental Procedures) was clearly higher for the bimodal responses (Figure 3D, gray bars) than for the modality-specific responses (Figure 3D, colored bars). These results show that, during the delay period of the task, the pre-SMA signal that correlates with the remembered stimulus is, for the most part, the same regardless of modality, and the remaining sensitivity to modality becomes weaker toward the end of the delay, as the f2 stimulus becomes imminent. To further quantify this finding, the predominance of one modality over the other was analyzed during four different time periods, from the f1 stimulation until the end of the delay (Figures 3E and 3F). For each of the four time periods, all the time bins carrying either significant modality-specific or significant bimodal linear monotonic responses were considered. Comparing across these four time intervals, it becomes clear that, as time progresses, the number of bins carrying a significant monotonic signal, tactile or acoustic, increases steadily, together with the fraction considered bimodal (Figure 3E, left to right). Thus, in the 1 s interval immediately before f2 delivery, most of the bimodal points fall close to the diagonal, which corresponds to perfectly balanced bimodality (zero difference from 45°; Kolmogorov-Smirnov [K-S], p < 0.05 [Siegel and Castellan, 1988Siegel S. Castellan N.J. Nonparametric Statistics for Behavioral Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1988Google Scholar]), indicating that the strength of the encoding for both modalities was similar (Figure 3E, rightmost column). The same trend was found when alternative plots were generated on the basis of bins that carried a significant amount of information about stimulus frequency (calculated in bits; permutation test, p < 0.05; see Salinas et al., 2000Salinas E. Hernández A. Zainos A. Romo R. Periodicity and firing rate as candidate neural codes for the frequency of vibrotactile stimuli.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5503-5515PubMed Google Scholar), again marking each significant time bin as a response for tactile stimuli only, acoustic stimuli only, or both (Figure 3F). Thus, the increase in signal strength and in bimodality over time was evident based on two very different measures of association between stimulus frequency and firing activity (slope of tuning and frequency information; see Romo et al., 1999Romo R. Brody C.D. Hernández A. Lemus L. Neuronal correlates of parametric working memory in the prefrontal cortex.Nature. 1999; 399: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar and Salinas et al., 2000Salinas E. Hernández A. Zainos A. Romo R. Periodicity and firing rate as candidate neural codes for the frequency of vibrotactile stimuli.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5503-5515PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we plotted the information carried about stimulus frequency versus the information carried about stimulus modality, again for the same four chosen time periods (Figure 3G). Whereas both quantities show substantial scatter at the two earlier time periods, the information about modality diminishes considerably toward the end of the delay, confirming that the population activity becomes progressively less sensitive to modality. At these later time periods, most of the neurons reflected the f1 frequency in the same way, regardless of the modality through which f1 had been originally perceived (Figure 3G, fourth column; zero difference from 90°; K-S, p < 0.05 [Siegel and Castellan, 1988Siegel S. Castellan N.J. Nonparametric Statistics for Behavioral Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1988Google Scholar]). To search for firing rates that were not necessarily monotonic functions of f1, we grouped the responses depending on the value of f1 frequencies and tested whether there was any significant difference between responses to different f1 values of either tactile or acoustic stimuli by using a one-way ANOVA test (p < 0.05). The ANOVA test does not assume monotonicity or any other type of functional form. We analyzed all of the recorded pre-SMA neurons judged to have task-related responses (n = 183) in a time window of 200 ms displaced every 20 ms, using exactly the same format displayed in Figure 3. According to the ANOVA test, out of the 183 neurons, 115 showed significant f1-dependent responses (Figure S1): 96 showed monotonic functions (illustrated in Figure 3 and included in Figure S1), and 19 neurons showed nonmonotonic responses only (Figure S2). It is clear that the dynamic of the neuronal responses obtained with the ANOVA test (Figure S1) is quite similar to the dynamic responses obtained with the monotonic test (Figure 3), except that more bins conveying significant responses about f1 were detected with this test. To further display the responses of each of the 19 neurons, we normalized their activities using the z score transform (Figure S2 and Data Analysis in Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We found that 4 of the 19 neurons significantly responded to one modality only (3 tactile [neurons 17–19 in Figure S2] and 1 acoustic [neuron 1 in Figure S2]), again at different times during f1 and delay periods (Figures S2A–S2C). The rest of the neurons (15 of 19) showed bimodal bins with significant responses during f1 and delay periods, but shifted back and forth from bimodal to acoustic and tactile responses and vice versa (Figure S2). However, just by looking at their responses displayed at the time windows where the ANOVA test was significant (p < 0.05, Figure S2E), it is difficult to figure out the neural code representing the f1 value for either tactile or acoustic stimuli during working memory period of the task. We thus conclude that, within the resolution afforded by the tests used to decode information from the firing rates of pre-SMA neurons, monotonic coding seems to be the key representation of f1 during the working memory component of the task used here. Information decoded from the firing rates of pre-SMA neurons during the hit trials alone allowed us to determine to what extent it was correlated with the tactile and acoustic stimuli, but not with the monkey’s action choice itself, which might be partly based on the sensory stimulus encoded during the working memory component of this task. To further address this problem, we analyzed error trials and asked for each stimulus (f1, f2) pair, whether the activity of pre-SMA neurons showed any significant difference from hit trials. For this purpose, we used the normalized activity (z score) of all significant bins from the 96 monotonic neurons (Data Analysis in Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and information about f1 for each sensory modality was calculated as function of time, beginning 1 s before f1 up to the beginning of f2 for trials that ended in hit or error responses. In this analysis, we combined the z score from positive and negative monotonic bins according to their responses to the stimulus frequency (sorted out in opposite direction for trials where the tuning was negative, 8 Hz changed to 32 Hz, and vice versa). This monotonic dependence-frequency was called “joint frequency” (f1∗) to differentiate it from the original stimulus frequency. According with the monkeys’ performance and stimulus modality, we divided the responses into tactile hits, tactile errors, acoustic hits, and acoustic errors (z score probability distribution for each f1∗, P[Z|f1∗]). Using these distributions, we calculated the frequency information (bits) and monotonic strength (slope linear fitting) as a function of time. Figures 4A and 4B show that, during the delay period, information of either tactile or acoustic frequency significantly dropped for trials that ended in errors compared to those that ended in hits. This was also confirmed when we compared the slope values between hit and error trials of either modality (tactile slopes, Figure 4C versus Figure 4E; acoustic slopes, Figure 4D versus Figure 4F). However, such differences were not found during the f1 periods of either modality (overlapping interval confidence, significance level of 99%). Clearly, tactile slopes values calculated from error trials during the delay (Figure 4E) significantly decreased in comparison to the slopes calculated during hits trials (Figure 4C; see Figures S3A–S3C for slope comparisons). This trend was even more dramatic when we compared acoustic slope values calculated during hit trials (Figure 4D) versus the slopes calculated during error trials (Figure 4F; see also Figures S3D–S3F, and S3H). Apart from the above analysis, we also compared the monotonic strength during hit responses across modalities. We did not find significant differences between tactile and acoustic monotonic encoding (Figure 4C versus Figure 4D; see also Figures S3A, S3D, and S3G; slope difference = 0.006). However, this not necessarily implies that neural activity is similar for each f1∗; in other words, how similar (or different) is the activity evoked by each f1∗ across modalities? To further address this problem, we computed from the P(Z|f1∗) (hits displayed at the top of Figure 4G for tactile trials and to the right for acoustic hit trials) the mean z score activity for each f1∗. This analysis shows that each mean z score point lies near to the diagonal line (slope = 0.92; linear bivariate regression [Thirumalai et al., 2011Thirumalai K. Singh A. Ramesh R. A MATLAB™ code to perform weighted linear regression with (correlated or uncorrelated) errors in bivariate data.J. Geol. Soc. India. 2011; 77: 377-380Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar]), and none of each P(Z|f1∗) distribution differs between modalities (Figure S4). Thus, the f1∗ responses are similar regardless of the sensory modality. This suggests that an ideal observer could use a common decoder to know the stimulus frequency from the neuronal population activity, but not the sensory modality (see also Figure 3F). Interestingly, this was not the case when we compared the hit versus the error responses as a function of f1∗ (Figures 4H and 4I). Notably, the tactile slope was almost half from the diagonal line (slope = 0.48, Figure 4H), and even worse, the acoustic slope dropped near to zero (slope = 0.18, Figure 4I). This analysis shows that the encoding of each stimulus frequency is indistinguishable from each other during error trials as compared to the encoding of each stimulus frequency during hit trials. These results suggest that part of the behavioral responses could depend on the capacity of the pre-SMA neurons to encode information about f1 during the working memory component of the task used here. These results obtained in pre-SMA contrast with those of single neurons from early sensory cortices during the same task (Lemus et al., 2010Lemus L. Hernández A. Luna R. Zainos A. Romo R. Do sensory cortices process more than one sensory modality during perceptual judgments?.Neuron. 2010; 67: 335-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Neurons from S1 and A1 encoded their corresponding principal modalities only, and did so only during the stimulation periods. Although many previous studies have shown that neurons from distinct areas of the frontal lobe have the capacity to encode specific memorized quantities, such as visual spatial locations (Funahashi et al., 1989Funahashi S.

Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 3482-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), our study is the first to show that single neurons encode information in working memory about magnitude continua from two different sensory modalities. The same cells perform the same high-level cognitive function based on input signals originating from different sensory cortices. Exactly how those pre-SMA neurons acquire the capacity to encode and sustain information of either modality is not known. The primary sensory cortices, S1 and A1, do not connect directly with the pre-SMA, and they show a virtually complete absence of frequency-specific activity during the delay period of the flutter discrimination task (Lemus et al., 2010Lemus L. Hernández A. Luna R. Zainos A. Romo R. Do sensory cortices process more than one sensory modality during perceptual judgments?.Neuron. 2010; 67: 335-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, other circuits between the sensory and frontal cortices must play key roles in driving the pre-SMA responses documented here. The long latencies of pre-SMA neurons with delay period activity are consistent with this observation. Note, however, that the participation of other areas relates to two partially interrelated questions: (1) How, in general, is self-sustained activity generated during the delay period? And (2) at what point does the representation of stimulus frequency become bimodal? Regarding the first issue, single-unit recordings indicate that a wide network of cortical areas could potentially contribute to working memory. In fact, neurons from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), ventral premotor cortex (VPC), dorsal premotor cortex (DPC), and even the second somatosensory cortex (S2) show significant information about f1 stimulus frequency during the delay period of the vibrotactile version of the discrimination task (Romo et al., 1999Romo R.

Decoding a perceptual decision process across cortex.Neuron. 2010; 66: 300-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Anatomically, it is known that the pre-SMA receives inputs from the PFC (Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001Rizzolatti G. Luppino G.

Res. 2005; 53: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but beyond this, knowledge about the functional connectivity between these two areas is limited, making it difficult to establish a functional hierarchy among those areas that exhibit activity related to working memory. Proposed biophysical mechanisms that may contribute to working memory, such as synaptic facilitation (Mongillo et al., 2008Mongillo G. Barak O. Tsodyks M. Synaptic theory of working memory.Science. 2008; 319: 1543-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, Barak et al., 2010Barak O. Tsodyks M. Romo R.

Neurobiol. 2013; 103: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), do not help to distinguish the specific functional roles of these areas either. Regarding the second question, it is unknown at what point after the primary sensory areas the tactile and acoustic signals start converging on the same neurons. We do know that, in monkeys trained to perform the acoustic version of the flutter discrimination task, VPC neurons show monotonic stimulus encoding during the delay period, so the VPC processes tactile (Romo et al., 2004Romo R. Hernández A. Zainos A. Neuronal correlates of a perceptual decision in ventral premotor cortex.Neuron. 2004; 41: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and acoustic (Lemus et al., 2009Lemus L. Hernández A. Romo R. Neural encoding of auditory discrimination in ventral premotor cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 14640-14645Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) information in similar ways, but it is unknown whether the same neurons do so, as is the case in the pre-SMA. The alternative possibility is that the VPC or other areas more closely related to the primary sensory cortices, exhibit sustained, delay period activity that is predominantly modality-specific, and that the outputs of those dedicated memory circuits converge on the pre-SMA to render it bimodal. But, were the pre-SMA neurons truly bimodal or instead they reflected in their responses that monkeys were converting all the stimuli into the same modality (like tactile)? Although we cannot give an answer to these questions with our current experiments, the tactile strategy appears that did not help to learn the acoustic discrimination task. Monkeys required a large number of training sessions to learn discrimination between two acoustic stimuli. However, once the animals learned to discriminate between the two tactile stimuli and between the two acoustic stimuli, they then quickly performed the cross modal test. This would suggest, as discussed above, that the sensory representations in S1 and A1 are routed to the pre-SMA and perhaps to other frontal lobe circuits by separate, independent facilitated systems, each converging into these circuits. But, what it is ultimately reflected in the activity of pre-SMA is the coding of the stored stimulus frequency in working memory regardless of the sensory modality. Such modality independence suggests a high degree of functional specialization for this area. This supports the existence in pre-SMA of a supramodal (modality independent or amodal) neural code for short-term memory representations. Monotonic encoding seems to be the neural substrate of working memory for both tactile and acoustic stimuli during the discrimination task. This is supported by the fact that the strength of positive and negative responses decreased significantly during trials that ended in errors compared to those that ended in hits. These two opposite encodings of both tactile and acoustic stimuli are reflected in the activity of two separate, independent neuronal populations that might work together to maximize the storing of the f1 stimulus information in working memory for a successful comparison with f2 stimulus and, therefore, a correct decision report. A subtraction operation computed between pairs of S2 neurons simultaneously recorded, each with opposite monotonic tuning to the tactile stimulus frequency seems to reflect the actual neural computation that correlates with the animal’s discrimination performance (Romo et al., 2003Romo R. Hernández A. Zainos A. Salinas E. Correlated neuronal discharges that increase coding efficiency during perceptual discrimination.Neuron. 2003; 38: 649-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). But, whether this computation is implemented by pre-SMA neurons to store stimulus information during the working memory and decision making components of this task is an open question. In summary, we established that single pre-SMA neurons maintain a representation of a task-relevant parameter—a neural correlate of parametric working memory—regardless of the original modality whereby that parameter was originally perceived. At one extreme, such supramodal representation could be highly restricted; it might exist just for task parameters (stimulus frequency) that happen to be highly congruent and similarly discriminable across specific modalities (tactile and acoustic), as is the case for periodic stimuli in the flutter range. On the other hand, the results could be evidence of a much higher level of functional specialization in the underlying circuitry, in which case they could generalize to other modalities (e.g., visual) and one-dimensional, analog quantities (e.g., stimulus amplitude, or duration). Investigating the degree of abstraction of such perceptual representations, and how they are constructed, are important goals for future studies.

https://openalex.org/W2219521950,"Bovine mastitis is a costly disease in dairy cattle worldwide. As of yet, the control of bovine mastitis is mostly based on prevention by thorough hygienic procedures during milking. Additional strategies include vaccination and utilization of antibiotics. Despite these measures, mastitis is not fully under control, thus prompting the need for alternative strategies. The goal of this study was to isolate autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from bovine mammary microbiota that exhibit beneficial properties that could be used for mastitis prevention and/or treatment. Sampling of the teat canal led to the isolation of 165 isolates, among which a selection of ten non-redundant LAB strains belonging to the genera Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were further characterized with regard to several properties: surface properties (hydrophobicity, autoaggregation); inhibition potential of three main mastitis pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus uberis; colonization capacities of bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMEC); and immunomodulation properties. Three strains, Lactobacillus brevis 1595 and 1597 and Lactobacillus plantarum 1610, showed high colonization capacities and a medium surface hydrophobicity. These strains are good candidates to compete with pathogens for mammary gland colonization. Moreover, nine strains exhibited anti-inflammatory properties, as illustrated by the lower IL-8 secretion by E. coli-stimulated bMEC in the presence of these LAB. Full genome sequencing of five candidate strains allowed to check for undesirable genetic elements such as antibiotic resistance genes and to identify potential bacterial determinants involved in the beneficial properties. This large screening of beneficial properties while checking for undesirable genetic markers allowed the selection of promising candidate LAB strains from bovine mammary microbiota for the prevention and/or treatment of bovine mastitis."
https://openalex.org/W2211459200,"Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) has proven to be a powerful technique revealing complexity and diversity of natural DOM molecules, but its application to DOM analysis in grazing-impacted agricultural systems remains scarce. In the present study, we presented a case study of using ESI-FTICR-MS in analyzing DOM from four headwater streams draining forest- or pasture-dominated watersheds in Virginia, USA. In all samples, most formulas were CHO compounds (71.8–87.9%), with other molecular series (CHOS, CHON, CHONS, and CHOP (N, S)) accounting for only minor fractions. All samples were dominated by molecules falling in the lignin-like region (H/C = 0.7–1.5, O/C = 0.1–0.67), suggesting the predominance of allochthonous, terrestrial plant-derived DOM. Relative to the two pasture streams, DOM formulas in the two forest streams were more similar, based on Jaccard similarity coefficients and nonmetric multidimensional scaling calculated from Bray-Curtis distance. Formulas from the pasture streams were characterized by lower proportions of aromatic formulas and lower unsaturation, suggesting that the allochthonous versus autochthonous contributions of organic matter to streams were modified by pasture land use. The number of condensed aromatic structures (CAS) was higher for the forest streams, which is possibly due to the controlled burning in the forest-dominated watersheds and suggests that black carbon was mobilized from soils to streams. During 15-day biodegradation experiments, DOM from the two pasture streams was altered to a greater extent than DOM from the forest streams, with formulas with H/C and O/C ranges similar to protein (H/C = 1.5–2.2, O/C = 0.3–0.67), lipid (H/C = 1.5–2.0, O/C = 0–0.3), and unsaturated hydrocarbon (H/C = 0.7–1.5, O/C = 0–0.1) being the most bioreactive groups. Aromatic compound formulas including CAS were preferentially removed during combined light+bacterial incubations, supporting the contention that black carbon is labile to light alterations. Collectively, our data demonstrate that headwater DOM composition contains integrative information on watershed sources and processes, and the application of ESI-FTICR-MS technique offers additional insights into compound composition and reactivity unrevealed by fluorescence and stable carbon isotopic measurements."

A interconnected breeding (IB) population consisted of 497 advanced lines developed using HHZ as the recurrent parent and eight diverse elite indica lines as the donors were used to identify stably expressed QTLs for CT at the booting stage. A total of 41,754 high-quality SNPs were obtained through re-sequencing of the IB population. Phenotyping was conducted under field conditions in two years and three locations. Association analysis identified six QTLs for CT on the chromosomes 3, 4 and 12. QTL qCT-3-2 that showed stable CT across years and locations was fine-mapped to an approximately 192.9 kb region. Our results suggested that GWAS applied to an IB population allows better integration of gene discovery and breeding. QTLs can be mapped in high resolution and quickly utilized in breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2200260928,"Reef-building corals host assemblages of symbiotic algae (Symbiodinium spp.) whose diversity and abundance may fluctuate under different conditions, potentially facilitating acclimatization to environmental change. The composition of free-living Symbiodinium in reef waters and sediments may also be environmentally labile and may influence symbiotic assemblages by mediating supply and dispersal. The magnitude and spatial scales of environmental influence over Symbiodinium composition in different reef habitat compartments are, however, not well understood. We used pyrosequencing to compare Symbiodinium in sediments, water, and ten coral species between two backreef pools in American Samoa with contrasting thermal environments. We found distinct compartmental assemblages of clades A, C, D, F, and/or G Symbiodinium types, with strong differences between pools in water, sediments, and two coral species. In the pool with higher and more variable temperatures, abundance of various clade A and C types differed compared to the other pool, while abundance of D types was lower in sediments but higher in water and in Pavona venosa, revealing an altered habitat distribution and potential linkages among compartments. The lack of between-pool effects in other coral species was due to either low overall variability (in the case of Porites) or high within-pool variability. Symbiodinium communities in water and sediment also showed within-pool structure, indicating that environmental influences may operate over multiple, small spatial scales. This work suggests that Symbiodinium composition is highly labile in reef waters, sediments, and some corals, but the underlying drivers and functional consequences of this plasticity require further testing with high spatial resolution biological and environmental sampling."
https://openalex.org/W2206599031,"Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), products of microbial fermentation of dietary fiber, exert multiple metabolic effects in cells. Previously, we had demonstrated that soluble fiber influenced fat mass accumulation, gut microbial community structure and SCFA production in pigs. The current study was designed to identify effects of SCFA treatment during adipogenic differentiation of porcine stromovascular cells on lipid metabolism and adipokine expression. Differentiating cells were treated with varying concentrations of butyrate. Results show that butyrate treatment enhanced adipogenesis and lipid accumulation, perhaps through upregulation of glucose uptake and de novo lipogenesis and other mechanisms that include induction of SREBP-1c, C/EBPα/β, GLUT4, LPL, PPARγ, GPAT4, DGAT1 and DGAT2 expression. In addition, butyrate induced adiponectin expression, resulting in activation of downstream target genes, such as AMPK and AKT. Activation of AMPK by butyrate led to phosphorylation of ACC. Although increased ACO gene expression was seen with butyrate treatment, experiments with the peroxisomal fatty acid inhibitor, thioridazine, suggest that butyrate may have an inhibitory effect on peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. Our studies also provide evidence that butyrate may inhibit lipolysis, perhaps in an FFAR3-dependent manner. Therefore, this study presents a novel paradigm for butyrate action in adipocytes and shows that adipocytes are capable of utilizing butyrate, leading to increased expression of adiponectin for enhanced glucose uptake and improved insulin sensitivity."

https://openalex.org/W2199463278,"Background Trends towards day case surgery and enhanced recovery mean that postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) may increasingly arise after hospital discharge. However, hospital data alone are unable to capture adverse events that occur outside of the hospital setting. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has suggested the use of primary care data to quantify hospital care-related VTE. Data in surgical patients using these resources is lacking. The aim of this study was to measure VTE risk and associated mortality in general surgery using linked primary care and hospital databases, to improve our understanding of harm from VTE that arises beyond hospital stay. Methods This was a longitudinal cohort study using nationally linked primary care (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, CPRD), hospital administrative (Hospital Episodes Statistics, HES), population statistics (Office of National Statistics, ONS) and National Cancer Intelligence Network databases. Routinely collected information was used to quantify 90-day in-hospital VTE, 90-day post-discharge VTE and 90-day mortality in adults undergoing one of twelve general surgical procedures between 1st April 1997 and 31st March 2012. The earliest postoperative recording of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in CPRD, HES and ONS was counted in each patient. Covariates from multiple datasets were combined to derive detailed prediction models for VTE and mortality. Limitation included the capture of VTE presenting to healthcare only and the lack of information on adherence to pharmacological thromboprophylaxis as there was no data linkage to hospital pharmacy records. Results There were 981 VTE events captured within 90 days of surgery in 168005 procedures (23.7/1000 patient-years). Overall, primary care data increased the detection of postoperative VTE by a factor of 1.38 (981/710) when compared with using HES and ONS only. Total VTE rates ranged between 3.2/1000 patient-years in haemorrhoidectomy to 118.3/1000 patient-years in esophagogastric resection. Predictors of VTE included emergency surgery (OR = 1.91 95%CI 1.60–2.28, p<0.001), age (OR = 1.02 95%CI 1.02–1.03, p<0.001), body mass index (OR = 1.03 95%CI 1.01–1.04, p<0.001), previous VTE (OR = 8.07 95%CI 6.61–9.83, p<0.001), length of stay (OR = 1.00 95%CI 1.00–1.00, p = 0.007) and cancer stages II (OR = 1.38 95%CI 1.03–1.87, p = 0.033), III (OR = 1.50 95%CI 1.11–2.01, p = 0.008) and IV (OR = 1.63 95%CI 1.03–2.59, p = 0.038). Major organ resections had the greatest odds of VTE when adjusted for other risk factors including length of hospital stay. Post-discharge VTE accounted for 64.8% (636/981) of all recorded VTE. In-hospital VTE (165.4/1000 patient-years) was recorded more frequently than post-discharge VTE (16.2/1000 patient-years). Both in-hospital (OR = 2.07 95%CI 1.51–2.85, p<0.001) and post-discharge (OR = 4.03 95%CI 2.95–5.51, p<0.001) VTE independently predicted 90-day mortality. In patients who died and VTE was recorded on HES or CPRD (n = 56), VTE was one of the causes of death in 37.5% (21/56) of cases. Conclusions A large proportion of postoperative VTE was detected in primary care. Evaluation of linked databases was a useful way of measuring postoperative VTE at population level. These resources identified a significant association between post-discharge VTE and mortality in general surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2198533860,"Background Point-of-care tests for chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhoea (NG) could increase the uptake and timeliness of testing and treatment, contribute to improved disease control and reduce reproductive morbidity. The GeneXpert (Xpert CT/NG assay), suited to use at the point-of-care, is being used in the TTANGO randomised controlled trial (RCT) in 12 remote Australian health services with a high burden of sexually transmissible infections (STIs). This represents the first ever routine use of a molecular point-of-care diagnostic for STIs in primary care. The purpose of this study was to explore the acceptability of the GeneXpert to primary care staff in remote Australia. Methods In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 16 staff (registered or enrolled nurses and Aboriginal Health Workers/Practitioners) trained and experienced with GeneXpert testing. Interviews were digitally-recorded and transcribed verbatim prior to content analysis. Results Most participants displayed positive attitudes, indicating the test was both easy to use and useful in their clinical context. Participants indicated that point-of-care testing had improved management of STIs, resulting in more timely and targeted treatment, earlier commencement of partner notification, and reduced follow up efforts associated with client recall. Staff expressed confidence in point-of-care test results and treating patients on this basis, and reported greater job satisfaction. While point-of-care testing did not negatively impact on client flow, several found the manual documentation processes time consuming, suggesting that improved electronic connectivity and test result transfer between the GeneXpert and patient management systems could overcome this. Managing positive test results in a shorter time frame was challenging for some but most found it satisfying to complete episodes of care more quickly. Conclusions In the context of a RCT, health professionals working in remote primary care in Australia found the GeneXpert highly acceptable. These findings have implications for use in other primary care settings around the world."
https://openalex.org/W2208994644,"The exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by Streptococcus mutans-derived glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) are essential virulence factors associated with the initiation of cariogenic biofilms. EPS forms the core of the biofilm matrix-scaffold, providing mechanical stability while facilitating the creation of localized acidic microenvironments. Cranberry flavonoids, such as A-type proanthocyanidins (PACs) and myricetin, have been shown to inhibit the activity of Gtfs and EPS-mediated bacterial adhesion without killing the organisms. Here, we investigated whether a combination of cranberry flavonoids disrupts EPS accumulation and S. mutans survival using a mixed-species biofilm model under cariogenic conditions. We also assessed the impact of cranberry flavonoids on mechanical stability and the in situ pH at the biofilm-apatite interface. Topical application of an optimized combination of PACs oligomers (100-300 μM) with myricetin (2 mM) twice daily was used to simulate treatment regimen experienced clinically. Treatments with cranberry flavonoids effectively reduced the insoluble EPS content (>80% reduction vs. vehicle-control; p<0.001), while hindering S. mutans outgrowth within mixed-species biofilms. As a result, the 3D architecture of cranberry-treated biofilms was severely compromised, showing a defective EPS-matrix and failure to develop microcolonies on the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) surface. Furthermore, topical applications of cranberry flavonoids significantly weaken the mechanical stability of the biofilms; nearly 90% of the biofilm was removed from sHA surface after exposure to a shear stress of 0.449 N/m2 (vs. 36% removal in vehicle-treated biofilms). Importantly, in situ pH measurements in cranberry-treated biofilms showed significantly higher pH values (5.2 ± 0.1) at the biofilm-apatite interface vs. vehicle-treated biofilms (4.6 ± 0.1). Altogether, the data provide important insights on how cranberry flavonoids treatments modulate virulence properties by disrupting the biochemical and ecological changes associated with cariogenic biofilm development, which could lead to new alternative or adjunctive antibiofilm/anticaries chemotherapeutic formulations."

However, vertebrate genomes can contain up to 25 Wnt genes, the functions of which are poorly characterized partly due to redundancy in their expression. To identify candidate Wnt genes as candidate mediators of pathway activity in specific brain progenitor zones, we have performed a comprehensive expression analysis at three different stages during zebrafish development. Antisense RNA probes for 21 Wnt genes were generated from existing and newly synthesized cDNA clones and used for in situ hybridization on whole embryos and dissected brains. As in other species, we found that Wnt expression patterns in the embryonic zebrafish CNS are complex and often redundant. We observed that progenitor zones in the telencephalon, dorsal diencephalon, hypothalamus, midbrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, cerebellum and retina all express multiple Wnt genes. Our data identify 12 specific ligands that can now be tested using loss-of-function approaches."

Meanwhile the period of older age continues to extend with increase in life expectancy. This challenge demands an understanding of how cognition changes over an extended period in later life. But studying cognitive ageing in the population faces a difficulty from the fact that older respondents are liable to leave (attrite) before study completion. This study tested three hypotheses: trajectories of cognitive ageing in Britain show an improvement beyond the age of 50; and they are lifted by secular improvement in cognition across cohorts; lastly they are susceptible to distortion due to attrition.Using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, this paper studied trajectories of episodic memory of Britons aged 50-89 from 2002 to 2013 (N = 5931). Using joint models the analysis found that levels of episodic memory follow a curvilinear shape, not a steady decline, in later life. The findings also revealed secular improvement in cognitive ageing such that as a cohort is being replaced episodic memory levels in the population improve. The analysis lastly demonstrated that failure to simultaneously model attrition can produce distorted pictures of cognitive ageing.Old age in this century is not necessarily a period dominated by cognitive decline. In identifying behavioural factors associated with better cognitive ageing, such as social connections of traditional and online kinds, the paper raises possibilities of mustering an adequate response to the cognition challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2209488220,"The direct induction of cell death, or apoptosis, in target cells is one of the effector mechanisms for the anti CD20 antibody Rituximab. Here we provide evidence that Rituximab’s apoptotic ability is linked to the antibody IgG isotype. Reformatting Rituximab from the standard human IgG1 heavy chain into IgG2 or IgG4 boosted in vitro apoptosis induction in the Burkitt’s lymphoma B cell line Ramos five and four-fold respectively. The determinants for this behavior are located in the hinge region and CH1 domain of the heavy chain. By transplanting individual IgG2 or IgG4 specific amino acid residues onto otherwise IgG1 like backbones, thereby creating hybrid antibodies, the same enhancement of apoptosis induction could be achieved. The cysteines at position 131 of the CH1 domain and 219 in the hinge region, involved in IgG2 and IgG4 disulfide formation, were found to be of particular structural importance. Our data indicates that the hybrid antibodies possess a different CD20 binding mode than standard Rituximab, which appears to be key in enhancing apoptotic ability. The presented work opens up an interesting engineering route for enhancing the direct cytotoxic ability of therapeutic antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2199952715,"Background and Objectives Ultrafiltration (UF) of excess fluid activates numerous compensatory mechanisms during hemodialysis (HD). The increase of both total peripheral and splanchnic vascular resistance is considered essential in maintaining hemodynamic stability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent of UF-induced changes in hepato-splanchnic blood flow and resistance in a group of maintenance HD patients during regular dialysis. Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements Hepato-splanchnic flow resistance index (RI) and hepato-splanchnic perfusion index (QI) were measured in 12 chronic HD patients using a modified, non-invasive Indocyaningreen (ICG) dilution method. During a midweek dialysis session we determined RI, QI, ICG disappearance rate (kICG), plasma volume (Vp), hematocrit (Hct), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) at four times in hourly intervals (t1 to t4). Dialysis settings were standardized and all patient studies were done in duplicate. Results In the whole study group mean UF volume was 1.86 ± 0.46 L, Vp dropped from 3.65 ± 0.77L at t1 to 3.40 ± 0.78L at t4, and all patients remained hemodynamically stable. In all patients RI significantly increased from 12.40 ± 4.21 mmHg∙s∙m2/mL at t1 to 14.94 ± 6.36 mmHg∙s∙m2/mL at t4 while QI significantly decreased from 0.61 ± 0.22 at t1 to 0.52 ± 0.20 L/min/m2 at t4, indicating active vasoconstriction. In diabetic subjects, however, RI was significantly larger than in non-diabetics at all time points. QI was lower in diabetic subjects. Conclusions In chronic HD-patients hepato-splanchnic blood flow substantially decreases during moderate UF as a result of an active splanchnic vasoconstriction. Our data indicate that diabetic HD-patients are particularly prone to splanchnic ischemia and might therefore have an increased risk for bacterial translocation, endotoxemia and systemic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2209997717,"Background The presence of nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) in the peripheral blood of critically ill patients is associated with a poorer prognosis, though data on cardiovascular critical care patients is lacking. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of NRBCs as a predictor of intensive care unit (ICU) and in hospital all-cause mortality among cardiologic patients. Methods NRBCs were measured daily in consecutive cardiac ICU patients, including individuals with both coronary and non-coronary acute cardiac care. We excluded patients younger than 18 years, with cancer or hematological disease, on glucocorticoid therapy, those that were readmitted after hospital discharge and patients who died in the first 24 hours after admission. We performed a multiple logistic analysis to identify independent predictors of mortality. Results We included 152 patients (60.6 ± 16.8 years, 51.8% female, median ICU stay of 7 [4–11] days). The prevalence of NRBCs was 54.6% (83/152). The presence of NRBC was associated with a higher ICU mortality (49.4% vs 21.7%, P<0.001) as well as in-hospital mortality (61.4% vs 33.3%, p = 0.001). NRBC were equally associated with mortality among coronary disease (64.71% vs 32.5% [OR 3.80; 95%CI: 1.45–10.0; p = 0.007]) and non-coronary disease patients (61.45% vs 33.3% [OR 3.19; 95%CI: 1.63–6.21; p<0.001]). In a multivariable model, the inclusion of NRBC to the APACHE II score resulted in a significant improvement in the discrimination (p = 0.01). Conclusions NRBC are predictors of all-cause in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to a cardiac ICU. This predictive value is independent and complementary to the well validated APACHE II score."
https://openalex.org/W2214311459,"The development of spinal hyper-reflexia as part of the spasticity syndrome represents one of the major complications associated with chronic spinal traumatic injury (SCI). The primary mechanism leading to progressive appearance of muscle spasticity is multimodal and may include loss of descending inhibitory tone, alteration of segmental interneuron-mediated inhibition and/or increased reflex activity to sensory input. Here, we characterized a chronic thoracic (Th 9) complete transection model of muscle spasticity in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Isoflurane-anesthetized rats received a Th9 laminectomy and the spinal cord was transected using a scalpel blade. After the transection the presence of muscle spasticity quantified as stretch and cutaneous hyper-reflexia was identified and quantified as time-dependent changes in: i) ankle-rotation-evoked peripheral muscle resistance (PMR) and corresponding electromyography (EMG) activity, ii) Hoffmann reflex, and iii) EMG responses in gastrocnemius muscle after paw tactile stimulation for up to 8 months after injury. To validate the clinical relevance of this model, the treatment potency after systemic treatment with the clinically established anti-spastic agents baclofen (GABAB receptor agonist), tizanidine (α2-adrenergic agonist) and NGX424 (AMPA receptor antagonist) was also tested. During the first 3 months post spinal transection, a progressive increase in ankle rotation-evoked muscle resistance, Hoffmann reflex amplitude and increased EMG responses to peripherally applied tactile stimuli were consistently measured. These changes, indicative of the spasticity syndrome, then remained relatively stable for up to 8 months post injury. Systemic treatment with baclofen, tizanidine and NGX424 led to a significant but transient suppression of spinal hyper-reflexia. These data demonstrate that a chronic Th9 spinal transection model in adult SD rat represents a reliable experimental platform to be used in studying the pathophysiology of chronic spinal injury-induced spasticity. In addition a consistent anti-spastic effect measured after treatment with clinically effective anti-spastic agents indicate that this model can effectively be used in screening new anti-spasticity compounds or procedures aimed at modulating chronic spinal trauma-associated muscle spasticity."

Current differentiation protocols of human embryonic stem cells towards insulin producing beta cells focus on soluble molecules whereas the impact of cell-matrix interactions has been mainly unattended. In this study almost 500 different extracellular matrix protein combinations were screened to systemically identify extracellular matrix proteins that influence differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to the definitive endoderm lineage. The percentage of definitive endoderm cells after differentiation on collagen I and fibronectin was >85% and 65%, respectively. The cells on collagen I substrates displayed different morphology and gene expression during differentiation as assessed by time lapse studies compared to cells on the other tested substrates. Global gene expression analysis showed that cells differentiated on collagen I were largely similar to cells on fibronectin after completed differentiation. Collectively, the data suggest that collagen I induces a more rapid and consistent differentiation of stem cells to definitive endoderm. The results shed light on the importance of extracellular matrix proteins for differentiation and also points to a cost effective and easy method to improve differentiation."

Three candidates with established safety profiles were further evaluated in erythroid progenitors, anemic baboons and transgenic mice, with significant induction of γ-globin expression observed in vivo. A lead candidate, Benserazide, emerged which demonstrated > 20-fold induction of γ-globin mRNA expression in anemic baboons and increased F-cell proportions by 3.5-fold in transgenic mice. Benserazide has been used chronically to inhibit amino acid decarboxylase to enhance plasma levels of L-dopa. These studies confirm the utility of high-throughput screening and identify previously unrecognized fetal globin inducing candidates which can be developed expediently for treatment of hemoglobinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2284343637,"The objective of this study was to assess the structure, anti-tyrosinase activity, and mechanism of proanthocyanidins extracted from Rhododendron pulchrum leaves. Results obtained from mass spectra of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) revealed that proanthocyanidins were complex mixtures of procyanidins, prodelphinidins, propelargonidins, and their derivatives, among which procyanidins were the main components. The anti-tyrosinase analysis results indicated that the mixtures were reversible and mixed competitive inhibitors of tyrosinase. Interactions between proanthocyanidins with substrate (L-tyrosine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) and with copper ions were the important molecular mechanisms for explaining their efficient inhibition. This research would provide scientific evidence for the use of R. pulchrum leaf proanthocyanidins as new novel tyrosinase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2220688426,"Natural environments are considerably more variable than laboratory settings and often involve transient exposure to stressful conditions. To fully understand how organisms have evolved to respond to any given stress, prior experience must therefore be considered. We investigated the effects of individual and ancestral experience on C. elegans reproduction. We documented ways in which cultivation at 15°C or 25°C affects developmental time, lifetime fecundity, and reproductive performance after severe heat stress that exceeds the fertile range of the organism but is compatible with survival and future fecundity. We found that experience modulates multiple aspects of reproductive physiology, including the male and female germ lines and the interaction between them. These responses vary in their environmental sensitivity, suggesting the existence of complex mechanisms for coping with unpredictable and stressful environments."
https://openalex.org/W2218306408,"The acetyltransferase, E1a-binding protein (p300), is proposed to regulate various aspects of skeletal muscle development, metabolism, and mitochondrial function, via its interaction with numerous transcriptional regulators and other proteins. Remarkably, however, the contribution of p300 to skeletal muscle function and metabolism, in vivo, is poorly understood. To address this, we used Cre-LoxP methodology to generate mice with skeletal muscle-specific knockout of E1a-binding protein (mKO). mKO mice were indistinguishable from their wild-type/floxed littermates, with no differences in lean mass, skeletal muscle structure, fiber type, respirometry flux, or metabolites of fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. Ex vivo muscle function in extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles, including peak stress and time to fatigue, as well as in vivo running capacity were also comparable. Moreover, expected adaptations to a 20 d voluntary wheel running regime were not compromised in mKO mice. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that p300 is not required for the normal development or functioning of adult skeletal muscle, nor is it required for endurance exercise-mediated mitochondrial adaptations.—LaBarge, S.

https://openalex.org/W2232069091,"Public information is widely available at low cost to animals living in social groups. For instance, bystanders may eavesdrop on signaling interactions between conspecifics and use it to adapt their subsequent behavior towards the observed individuals. This social eavesdropping ability is expected to require specialized mechanisms such as social attention, which selects social information available for learning. To begin exploring the genetic basis of social eavesdropping, we used a previously established attention paradigm in the lab to study the brain gene expression profile of male zebrafish (Danio rerio) in relation to the attention they paid towards conspecifics involved or not involved in agonistic interactions. Microarray gene chips were used to characterize their brain transcriptomes based on differential expression of single genes and gene sets. These analyses were complemented by promoter region-based techniques. Using data from both approaches, we further drafted protein interaction networks. Our results suggest that attentiveness towards conspecifics, whether interacting or not, activates pathways linked to neuronal plasticity and memory formation. The network analyses suggested that fos and jun are key players on this response, and that npas4a, nr4a1 and egr4 may also play an important role. Furthermore, specifically observing fighting interactions further triggered pathways associated to a change in the alertness status (dnajb5) and to other genes related to memory formation (btg2, npas4b), which suggests that the acquisition of eavesdropped information about social relationships activates specific processes on top of those already activated just by observing conspecifics."
https://openalex.org/W2207091647,"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K is a part of the ribonucleoprotein complex which regulates diverse biological events. While overexpression of hnRNP K has been shown to be related to tumorigenesis in several cancers, both the expression patterns and biological mechanisms of hnRNP K in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells remain unclear. In this study, we showed that hnRNP K protein was strongly expressed in selected RCC cell lines (ACHN, A498, Caki-1, 786-0), and knock-down of hnRNP K expression by siRNA induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Based on immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of hnRNP K expression in human clear cell RCC specimens, we demonstrated that there was a significant positive correlation between hnRNP K staining score and tumor aggressiveness (e.g., Fuhrman grade, metastasis). Particularly, the rate of cytoplasmic localization of hnRNP K in primary RCC with distant metastasis was significantly higher than that in RCC without metastasis. Additionally, our results indicated that the cytoplasmic distribution of hnRNP K induced by TGF-β stimulus mainly contributed to TGF-β-triggered tumor cell invasion in RCC cells. Dominant cytoplasmic expression of ectopic hnRNP K markedly suppressed the inhibition of invasion by knock-down of endogenous hnRNP K. The expression level of matrix metalloproteinase protein-2 was decreased by endogenous hnRNP K knock-down, and restored by ectopic hnRNP K. Therefore, hnRNP K may be a key molecule involved in cell motility in RCC cells, and molecular mechanism associated with the subcellular localization of hnRNP K may be a novel target in the treatment of metastatic RCC."

N-terminal sequencing revealed these smaller fragments to be proteolytic cleavage products and identified a limited number of protease-sensitive sites in the antibody light and heavy chain sequences. No strictly conserved target sequence was evident, although the peptide bonds that were susceptible to proteolysis were predominantly and consistently located within or near to the interdomain or solvent-exposed regions in the antibody structure. Amino acids surrounding identified cleavage sites were mutated in an attempt to increase resistance. Different Guy's 13 antibody heavy and light chain mutant combinations were expressed transiently inN. tabacumand demonstrated intensity shifts in the fragmentation pattern, resulting in alterations to the full-length antibody-to-fragment ratio. The work strengthens the understanding of proteolytic cleavage of antibodies expressed in plants and presents a novel approach to stabilize full-length antibody by site-directed mutagenesis.-Hehle, V.

In this study, we used RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence to detect the expression of recombinant human lysozyme (rhLY) in the transgenic chicken. We demonstrated that the transgene of rhLY was genetically stable across different generations. We next optimized the purification procedure of rhLY from the transgenic eggs by utilizing two steps of cation-exchange chromatography and one gel-filtration chromatography. About 6 mg rhLY with the purity exceeding 90% was obtained from ten eggs, and the purification efficiency was about 75%. The purified rhLY had similar physicochemical and biological properties in molecular mass and antibacterial activity compared to the commercial human lysozyme. Additionally, both of them exhibited thermal stability at 60°C and tolerated an extensive pH range of 2 to 11. In conclusion, our study proved that the transgenic chickens we have previously generated were genetically stable and suitable for the production of active rhLY. We also provided a pipeline for purifying the recombinant proteins from transgenic eggs, which could be useful for other studies."
https://openalex.org/W2285807344,"The enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains lead to diarrhoea in humans due to heat-labile and heat-stable (STa) enterotoxins. STa increases Cl-release in intestinal cells, including the human colonic carcinoma T84 cell line, involving increased cGMP and membrane alkalization due to reduced Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) activity. Since NHEs modulate intracellular pH (pHi), and NHE1, NHE2, and NHE4 are expressed in T84 cells, we characterized the STa role as modulator of these exchangers. pHi was assayed by the NH4Cl pulse technique and measured by fluorescence microscopy in BCECF–preloaded cells. pHi recovery rate (dpHi/dt) was determined in the absence or presence of 0.25 μmol/L STa (30 minutes), 25 μmol/L HOE-694 (concentration inhibiting NHE1 and NHE2), 500 μmol/L sodium nitroprusside (SNP, spontaneous nitric oxide donor), 100 μmol/L dibutyryl cyclic GMP (db-cGMP), 100 nmol/L H89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), or 10 μmol/L forskolin (adenylyl cyclase activator). cGMP and cAMP were measured in cell extracts by radioimmunoassay, and buffering capacity (ßi) and H+ efflux (JH+) was determined. NHE4 protein abundance was determined by western blotting. STa and HOE-694 caused comparable reduction in dpHi/dt and JH+ (~63%), without altering basal pHi (range 7.144–7.172). STa did not alter ßi value in a range of 1.6 pHi units. The dpHi/dt and JH+ was almost abolished (~94% inhibition) by STa + HOE-694. STa effect was unaltered by db-cGMP or SNP. However, STa and forskolin increased cAMP level. STa–decreased dpHi/dt and JH+ was mimicked by forskolin, and STa + HOE-694 effect was abolished by H89. Thus, incubation of T84 cells with STa results in reduced NHE4 activity leading to a lower capacity of pHi recovery requiring cAMP, but not cGMP. STa effect results in a causal phenomenon (STa/increased cAMP/increased PKA activity/reduced NHE4 activity) ending with intracellular acidification that could have consequences in the gastrointestinal cells function promoting human diarrhoea."
https://openalex.org/W2208047517,"Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) modified by targeting DNA hypermethylation of genes in the Salvador/Warts/Hippo pathway were induced to differentiate into neuronal cells in vitro. The differentiated cells secreted a significant level of brain-derived neurotrophy factor (BDNF) and the expression of BDNF receptor tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) correlated well with the secretion of BDNF. In the differentiating cells, CREB was active after the binding of growth factors to induce phosphorylation of ERK in the MAPK/ERK pathway. Downstream of phosphorylated CREB led to the functional maturation of differentiated cells and secretion of BDNF, which contributed to the sustained expression of pERK and pCREB. In summary, both PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways play important roles in the neuronal differentiation of MSCs. The main function of the PI3K/Akt pathway is to maintain cell survival during neural differentiation; whereas the role of the MAPK/ERK pathway is probably to promote the maturation of differentiated MSCs. Further, cellular levels of protein kinase C epsilon type (PKC-ε) and kinesin heavy chain (KIF5B) increased with time of induction, whereas the level of NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 (Nm23-H1) decreased during the time course of differentiation. The correlation between PKC-ε and TrkB suggested that there is cross-talk between PKC-ε and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2279663120,"The activity of matrix degrading enzymes plays a leading role in the rupture of the fetal membranes under normal and pathological human labor, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) it is considered a biomarker of this event. To gain further insight into local MMP-9 origin and activation, in this study we analyzed the contribution of human placental leukocytes to MMP-9 secretion and explored the local mechanisms of the pro-enzyme activation.Placental blood leukocytes were obtained from women at term gestation without labor and maintained in culture up to 72 h. MMP-9 activity in the culture supernatants was determined by zymography and using a specific substrate. The presence of a potential pro-MMP-9 activator in the culture supernatants was monitored using a recombinant biotin-labeled human pro-MMP-9. To characterize the endogenous pro-MMP-9 activator, MMP-1, -3, -7 and -9 were measured by multiplex assay in the supernatants, and an inhibition assay of MMP-9 activation was performed using an anti-human MMP-3 and a specific MMP-3 inhibitor. Finally, production of MMP-9 and MMP-3 in placental leukocytes obtained from term pregnancies with and without labor was assessed by immunofluorescence.Placental leukocytes spontaneously secreted pro-MMP-9 after 24 h of culture, increasing significantly at 48 h (P≤0.05), when the active form of MMP-9 was detected. Culture supernatants activated the recombinant pro-MMP-9 showing that placental leukocytes secrete the activator. A significant increase in MMP-3 secretion by placental leukocytes was observed since 48 h in culture (P≤0.05) and up to 72 h (P≤0.001), when concentration reached its maximum value. Specific activity of MMP-9 decreased significantly (P≤0.005) when an anti-MMP-3 antibody or a specific MMP-3 inhibitor were added to the culture media. Placental leukocytes from term labor produced more MMP-9 and MMP-3 compared to term non-labor cells.In this work we confirm that placental leukocytes from human term pregnancies are able to secrete large amounts of MMP-9, and that the production of the enzyme it is enhanced by labor. We also demonstrate for the first time that endogenous MMP-3 plays a major role in MMP-9 activation process. These findings support the contribution of placental leukocytes to create the collagenolytic microenvironment that induces the rupture of the fetal membranes during human labor."

ROIs were drawn to delineate caudate nucleus (CN), putamen (PU), globus pallidus (GP) and substantia nigra (SN) on the co-registered maps. The SN was divided in 3 descending levels (SL 1–3). The most significant parameters were used for a flexible discrimination analysis (FDA) in a training collective consisting of 25 randomized subjects from each group in order to predict the classification of remaining subjects. PD-all showed significant increases in MD, R2 and R2* within SN and its subregions as well as in MD and R2* within different basal ganglia regions. Compared to the HC group, the PD≤5 and the PD>5 group showed significant MD increases within the SN and its lower two subregions, while the PD≤5 group exhibited significant increases in R2 and R2* within SN and its subregions, and tended to elevation within the basal ganglia. The PD>5 group had significantly increased MD in PU and GP, whereas the PD≤5 group presented normal MD within the basal ganglia. FDA achieved right classification in 84% of study participants.

By analysis of the medaka genome, we found seven TGs orthologues, some of which apparently corresponded to the mammalian TG isozymes, TG1, TG2, and Factor XIII. All orthologues had preserved amino acid residues essential for enzymatic activity in their deduced primary structures. In this study, we analyzed biochemical properties of two orthologues (OlTGK1 and OlTGK2) of mammalian epithelium-specific TG (TG1) that are significantly expressed at the transcriptional level. Using purified recombinant proteins for OlTGK1 and OlTGK2, we characterized their catalytic reactions.

Methods The difficulty of goals and tasks in the emotional health domain of the Dutch ICF Activity Inventory were rated by 166 people with Retinitis Pigmentosa in a cross-sectional study. Demographic factors were also assessed. Results Responses to the 23 emotional health tasks were Rasch analysed and could be used to form either one 20 item overview scale with some multidimensionality, or three unidimensional subscales addressing feelings (4 items), communicating visual loss (5 items) and fatigue (7 items). The most difficult individual tasks related to communicating visual loss to other people, and dealing with feelings such as frustration, anxiety and stress. The use of mobility aids and female gender were associated with increased difficulty with emotional health, explaining 19% of the variance in the overview scale. Conclusions The emotional health domain of the Dutch ICF Activity Inventory is a valid tool to assess emotional difficulties arising from visual loss. Interventions to aid people with Retinitis Pigmentosa deal with emotional difficulties should particularly address communicating vision loss effectively to others and coping with negative feelings."

We draw the two networks and find that the call-based network resembles a higher order aggregation of the mobility network and that both are isomorphic except for a higher spatial decay coefficient of the mobility network relative to the call-based network: when we discount distance effects on the call connections with the same decay observed for mobility connections, the two networks are virtually indistinguishable."

Our main objective was to verify whether such an approach could be successfully applied to the discovery of mathematical equations that explain experimental data gathered during the observation of a given dynamic system. Moreover, we wanted to compare it with an approach based on artificial intelligence that uses symbolic regression to find such formulae automatically. To achieve this, we designed and implemented an Internet game in which players attempt to design a spaceship representing an equation that models the observed system. The game was designed while considering that it should be easy to use for people without strong mathematical backgrounds. Moreover, we tried to make use of the collective intelligence observed in crowdsourced systems by enabling many players to collaborate on a single solution. The idea was tested on several hundred players playing almost 10,000 games and conducting a user opinion survey. The results prove that the proposed solution has very high potential. The function generated during weeklong tests was almost as precise as the analytical solution of the model of the system and, up to a certain complexity level of the formulae, it explained data better than the solution generated automatically by Eureqa, the leading software application for the implementation of symbolic regression.

https://openalex.org/W2213044985,"Background Recently nonsynonymous coding variants in the ankyrin repeats and suppressor of cytokine signaling box-containing protein 10 (ASB10) gene were found to be associated with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) in cohorts from Oregon and Germany, but this finding was not confirmed in an independent cohort from Iowa. The aim of the current study was to assess the role of ASB10 gene variants in Pakistani glaucoma patients. Methods Sanger sequencing of the coding exons and splice junctions of the ASB10 gene was performed in 30 probands of multiplex POAG families, 208 sporadic POAG patients and 151 healthy controls from Pakistan. Genotypic associations of individual variants with POAG were analyzed with the Fisher’s exact or Chi-square test. Results In total 24 variants were identified in POAG probands and sporadic patients, including 11 novel variants and 13 known variants. 13 of the variants were nonsynonymous, 6 were synonymous, and 5 were intronic. Three nonsynonymous variants (p.Arg49Cys, p.Arg237Gly, p.Arg453Cys) identified in the probands were not segregating in the respective families. This is not surprising since glaucoma is a multifactorial disease, and multiple factors are likely to be involved in the disease manifestation in these families. However a nonsynonymous variant, p.Arg453Cys (rs3800791), was found in 6 sporadic POAG patients but not in controls, suggesting that it infers increased risk for the disease. In addition, one synonymous variant was found to be associated with sporadic POAG: p.Ala290Ala and the association of the variant with POAG remained significant after correction for multiple testing (uncorrected p-value 0.002, corrected p-value 0.047). The cumulative burden of rare, nonsynonymous variants was significantly higher in sporadic POAG patients compared to control individuals (p-value 0.000006). Conclusions Variants in ASB10 were found to be significantly associated with sporadic POAG in the Pakistani population. This supports previous findings that sequence variants in the ASB10 gene may act as a risk factor for glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2205770822,"Under certain kinds of cytoplasmic stress, Escherichia coli selectively reproduce by distributing the newer cytoplasmic components to new-pole cells while sequestering older, damaged components in cells inheriting the old pole. This phenomenon is termed polar aging or cell division asymmetry. It is unknown whether cell division asymmetry can arise from a periplasmic stress, such as the stress of extracellular acid, which is mediated by the periplasm. We tested the effect of periplasmic acid stress on growth and division of adherent single cells. We tracked individual cell lineages over five or more generations, using fluorescence microscopy with ratiometric pHluorin to measure cytoplasmic pH. Adherent colonies were perfused continually with LBK medium buffered at pH 6.00 or at pH 7.50; the external pH determines periplasmic pH. In each experiment, cell lineages were mapped to correlate division time, pole age and cell generation number. In colonies perfused at pH 6.0, the cells inheriting the oldest pole divided significantly more slowly than the cells inheriting the newest pole. In colonies perfused at pH 7.50 (near or above cytoplasmic pH), no significant cell division asymmetry was observed. Under both conditions (periplasmic pH 6.0 or pH 7.5) the cells maintained cytoplasmic pH values at 7.2–7.3. No evidence of cytoplasmic protein aggregation was seen. Thus, periplasmic acid stress leads to cell division asymmetry with minimal cytoplasmic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2214119315,"Introduction Although Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide, little is known about the natural course of the bacterial load during infection. We investigated the natural course of the bacterial load in the interval between screening and returning for treatment in genital and anorectal CT-infections. Materials & Methods CT-positive patients, visiting our STI-clinic in the Netherlands from June 2011–January 2014, provided a second urogenital and/or anorectal sample when returning for treatment (diagnostic sample = T1; treatment sample = T2). Patient-record provided data about the days between samples and the date of last unsafe sex. Included patients were ≥18 years old, HIV-negative and did not report antibiotic use in the study-interval. CT load was quantified using qPCR. CT load was log-transformed, and a CT load difference (Δ-CT load) of >1 log was deemed clinically relevant. Chi-square test compared load category distributions over time (decrease/equal/increase), between sample types. Results 274 patients provided 296 paired samples. Majority of samples had a stable CT load in the interval T1-T2 (66.3%, 73.1% and 48.6% for vaginal swabs, urine and anorectal swabs resp. p = 0.07). Load decreased in 17–41% of patients, while ±10% of patients showed an increase in CT load. No association between Δ-CT load and the interval T1-T2 was observed. Large variations can be seen in CT load at T1 and over time. Discussion The majority (±90%) of patients have a stable or decreasing CT load in the time interval between screening and returning for treatment. The number of days between sampling was not associated with change in CT load. In the first month after the last unsafe sex, only stable CT loads were seen. Our data seems to indicate that when most patients visit an STI-clinic, recommended 2 weeks after infection, the infection has already been established or is in its downward phase."
https://openalex.org/W2213237441,"A rice introgression line, NIL-SS1, and its recurrent parent, Teqing, were used to investigate the influence of the introgression segment on plant growth. The current research showed NIL-SS1 had an increased flag leaf width, total leaf area, spikelet number per panicle and grain yield, but a decreased photosynthetic rate. The metabolite differences in NIL-SS1 and Teqing at different developmental stages were assessed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technology. Significant metabolite differences were observed across the different stages. NIL-SS1 increased the plant leaf nitrogen content, and the greatest differences between NIL-SS1 and Teqing occurred at the booting stage. Compared to Teqing, the metabolic phenotype of NIL-SS1 at the booting stage has closer association with those at the flowering stage. The introgression segment induced more active competition for sugars and organic acids (OAs) from leaves to the growing young spikes, which resulted in more spikelet number per plant (SNP). The results indicated the introgression segment could improve rice grain yield by increasing the SNP and total leaf area per plant, which resulted from the higher plant nitrogen content across growth stages and stronger competition for sugars and OAs of young spikes at the booting stage."

To prevent the spread of a worm or to grasp how to regulate a prevailing worm, compartmental models are commonly used as a means to examine and understand the patterns and mechanisms of a worm spread. However, one of the greatest challenge is to produce methods to verify and validate the behavioural properties of a compartmental model. This is why in this study we suggest a framework based on Petri Nets and Model Checking through which we can meticulously examine and validate these models. We investigate Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model and propose a new model Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Delayed-Quarantined (Susceptible/Recovered) (SEIDQR(S/I)) along with hybrid quarantine strategy, which is then constructed and analysed using Stochastic Petri Nets and Continuous Time Markov Chain. The analysis shows that the hybrid quarantine strategy is extremely effective in reducing the risk of propagating the worm. Through Model Checking, we gained insight into the functionality of compartmental models. Model Checking results validate simulation ones well, which fully support the proposed framework."

Information from empirical studies was used to parameterise the model. Variance-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using the Saltelli method identified variables with the greatest influence on the prevalence of STEC O157 contaminated carcasses. Following a baseline scenario (no interventions), a series of simulations systematically introduced and tested interventions based on influential variables identified by repeated Saltelli GSA, to determine the most effective intervention strategy.Transfer of STEC O157 from hide or gastro-intestinal tract to carcass (improved abattoir hygiene) had the greatest influence on the prevalence of contaminated carcases. Due to interactions between inputs (identified by Saltelli GSA), combinations of interventions based on improved abattoir hygiene achieved a greater reduction in maximum prevalence than would be expected from an additive effect of single interventions. The most effective combination was improved abattoir hygiene with vaccination, which achieved a greater than ten-fold decrease in maximum prevalence compared to the baseline scenario.Study results suggest that effective interventions to reduce the prevalence of STEC O157 contaminated carcasses should initially be based on improved abattoir hygiene. However, the effect of improved abattoir hygiene on the distribution of STEC O157 concentration on carcasses is an important information gap-further empirical research is required to determine whether reduced prevalence of contaminated carcasses is likely to result in reduced incidence of STEC O157 associated illness in humans. This is the first use of variance-based GSA to assess the drivers of STEC O157 contamination of beef carcasses."

Of these, 22,231 (10.6%) were not previously annotated and 21,650 (10.3%) were expressed in a tissue-restricted pattern. Tissue-restricted alternative splicing was found to be widespread, with approximately 65% of expressed multi-exon genes containing at least one tissue-specific splice junction. Interestingly, we observed many tissue-specific splice junctions not only in genes expressed in one or a few tissues, but also from gene loci with a broad pattern of expression."
https://openalex.org/W2213734294,"Herein, we evaluated the concordance of population inferences and conclusions resulting from the analysis of short mitochondrial fragments (i.e., partial or complete D-Loop nucleotide sequences) versus complete mitogenome sequences for 53 bobwhites representing six ecoregions across TX and OK (USA). Median joining (MJ) haplotype networks demonstrated that analyses performed using small mitochondrial fragments were insufficient for estimating the true (i.e., complete) mitogenome haplotype structure, corresponding levels of divergence, and maternal population history of our samples. Notably, discordant demographic inferences were observed when mismatch distributions of partial (i.e., partial D-Loop) versus complete mitogenome sequences were compared, with the reduction in mitochondrial genomic information content observed to encourage spurious inferences in our samples. A probabilistic approach to variant prediction for the complete bobwhite mitogenomes revealed 344 segregating sites corresponding to 347 total mutations, including 49 putative nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) distributed across 12 protein coding genes. Evidence of gross heteroplasmy was observed for 13 bobwhites, with 10 of the 13 heteroplasmies involving one moderate to high frequency SNV. Haplotype network and phylogenetic analyses for the complete bobwhite mitogenome sequences revealed two divergent maternal lineages (dXY = 0.00731; FST = 0.849; P < 0.05), thereby supporting the potential for two putative subspecies. However, the diverged lineage (n = 103 variants) almost exclusively involved bobwhites geographically classified as Colinus virginianus texanus, which is discordant with the expectations of previous geographic subspecies designations. Tests of adaptive evolution for functional divergence (MKT), frequency distribution tests (D, FS) and phylogenetic analyses (RAxML) provide no evidence for positive selection or hybridization with the sympatric scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) as being explanatory factors for the two bobwhite maternal lineages observed. Instead, our analyses support the supposition that two diverged maternal lineages have survived from pre-expansion to post-expansion population(s), with the segregation of some slightly deleterious nonsynonymous mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2277537349,"Using an endoscopic approach, small intraoral bone chambers, which are routinely obtained during tooth extraction and implantation, provide visual in vivo access to internal bone structures. The aim of the present paper is to present a new method to quantify bone microstructure and vascularisation in vivo. Ten extraction sockets and 6 implant sites in 14 patients (6 men / 8 women) were examined by support immersion endoscopy (SIE). After tooth extraction or implant site preparation, microscopic bone analysis (MBA) was performed using short distance SIE video sequences of representative bone areas for off-line analysis with ImageJ. Quantitative assessment of the microstructure and vascularisation of the bone in dental extraction and implant sites in vivo was performed using ImageJ. MBA revealed bone morphology details such as unmineralised and mineralised areas, vascular canals and the presence of bleeding through vascular canals. Morphometric examination revealed that there was more unmineralised bone and less vascular canal area in the implant sites than in the extraction sockets."
https://openalex.org/W2210436847,"Previous mutation based studies showed that ablating synthesis of viral envelope proteins led to elevated hepadnaviral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) amplification, but it remains unknown how cccDNA amplification is regulated in natural hepadnaviral infection because of a lack of research system. In this study we report a simple procedure to prepare two identical duck hepatitis B virus inocula, but they possess 10-100-fold difference in cccDNA amplification in infected cell culture. We demonstrate that the infected cells with higher cccDNA amplification significantly reduce the virus secretion efficiency that results in higher accumulation of relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) and DHBsAg in the cells. The infected cells with lower cccDNA amplification significantly increase the virus secretion efficiency that leads to lower intracellular rcDNA and DHBsAg accumulation. In contrast with the findings generated in the mutation based experimental system, the regulation of cccDNA amplification in natural hepadnaviral infection bypasses direct regulation of the cellular envelope proteins concentration, instead it modulates virus secretion efficiency that ultimately impacts the intracellular rcDNA concentration, an important factor determining the destination of the synthesized rcDNA in infected cells."
