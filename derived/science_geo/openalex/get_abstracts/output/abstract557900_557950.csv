https://openalex.org/W2152983457,"We report the experimental realization of a single-atom heat engine. An ion is confined in a linear Paul trap with tapered geometry and driven thermally by coupling it alternately to hot and cold reservoirs. The output power of the engine is used to drive a harmonic oscillation. From direct measurements of the ion dynamics, we determine the thermodynamic cycles for various temperature differences of the reservoirs. We use these cycles to evaluate power $P$ and efficiency $\eta$ of the engine, obtaining up to $P=342\,$yJ and $\eta=0.28 \,\%$, consistent with analytical estimations. Our results demonstrate that thermal machines can be reduced to the ultimate limit of single atoms."

Biomaterial scaffolds, which help to guide regenerating tissue, are an exciting emerging therapeutic strategy to promote tissue repair. Sadtler et al. tested how biomaterial scaffolds interact with the immune system in damaged tissue to promote repair (see the Perspective by Badylak). Scaffolds derived from cardiac muscle and bone extracellular matrix components trigger a tissue-reparative T cell immune response in mice with injured muscles.

https://openalex.org/W2341849113,"Phosphorus is a macronutrient taken up by cells as inorganic phosphate (Pi). How cells sense cellular Pi levels is poorly characterized. Here, we report that SPX domains—which are found in eukaryotic phosphate transporters, signaling proteins, and inorganic polyphosphate polymerases—provide a basic binding surface for inositol polyphosphate signaling molecules (InsPs), the concentrations of which change in response to Pi availability. Substitutions of critical binding surface residues impair InsP binding in vitro, inorganic polyphosphate synthesis in yeast, and Pi transport in Arabidopsis. In plants, InsPs trigger the association of SPX proteins with transcription factors to regulate Pi starvation responses. We propose that InsPs communicate cytosolic Pi levels to SPX domains and enable them to interact with a multitude of proteins to regulate Pi uptake, transport, and storage in fungi, plants, and animals."

Ainsworth et al. have tracked the effects of three decades of increasing heat stress on coral organisms. In the past, pulses of elevated temperatures that presaged hot seasons stimulated the acclimation of coral organisms and resilience to thermal stress. More recently, temperature hikes have been severe and precluded acclimation. The result has been increasing bleaching and death; notably extreme during 2016 in the wake of El Niño.

Ramanan et al. show that intestinal helminth infection, caused by parasitic worms, protects IBD-susceptible mice from developing the disease. The infection increases specific protective species and limits other inflammatory members of the microbiota. People from helminth-endemic regions harbored a similar protective microbiota, and their deworming led to an increase in inflammatory Bacteroidales species, similar to what the authors observed in the mice. Thus, a changing microbial environment may shape susceptibility to inflammatory disease. Science , this issue p. 608"

Metal atoms adsorbed on surfaces can develop strong magnetization in an applied field (paramagnetism). Donati et al. show that single holmium atoms adsorbed on a magnesium oxide film grown on a silver substrate show residual magnetism for temperatures up to 30 K and bistabilty that lasts for 1500 s at 10 K (see the Perspective by Khajetoorians and Heinrich). The atom avoids spin relaxation by a combination of quantum-state symmetry and by the oxide film preventing the spin from interacting with the underlying metal via tunneling.

Klein et al. observed tree-to-tree carbon shuttling between roots of tall trees in a mixed temperate forest in Switzerland (see the Perspective by van der Heijden). By applying stable carbon isotope labeling to individual tree canopies, they show that up to 40% of the carbon in the fine roots of one individual may be derived from photosynthetic products of a neighbor. Carbon transfer of this kind, mediated by plant-associated fungi, or mycorrhizae, in the soil, has been reported on a smaller scale in seedlings, but not before in trees.

However, the quantum states of hydrogen nuclei are extremely sensitive to coupling with local environments, and these effects are broadened and averaged with conventional spectroscopic or diffraction techniques.

Resistance develops rapidly via mutations in the drug's target: the parasite's mitochondrial cytochrome b complex. Goodman et al. have discovered that although resistant Plasmodium berghei parasites persist in mice, in blood-sucking malarial mosquitoes, the mutations disable female parasites too much for them to reproduce. The human-specific Plasmodium falciparum can only be investigated experimentally in mosquitoes, but a similar effect was seen.

https://openalex.org/W2340840968,"The relationship between team size and productivity is a question of broad relevance across economics, psychology, and management science. For complex tasks, however, where both the potential benefits and costs of coordinated work increase with the number of workers, neither theoretical arguments nor empirical evidence consistently favor larger vs. smaller teams. Experimental findings, meanwhile, have relied on small groups and highly stylized tasks, hence are hard to generalize to realistic settings. Here we narrow the gap between real-world task complexity and experimental control, reporting results from an online experiment in which 47 teams of size ranging from n = 1 to 32 collaborated on a realistic crisis mapping task. We find that individuals in teams exerted lower overall effort than independent workers, in part by allocating their effort to less demanding (and less productive) sub-tasks; however, we also find that individuals in teams collaborated more with increasing team size. Directly comparing these competing effects, we find that the largest teams outperformed an equivalent number of independent workers, suggesting that gains to collaboration dominated losses to effort. Importantly, these teams also performed comparably to a field deployment of crisis mappers, suggesting that experiments of the type described here can help solve practical problems as well as advancing the science of collective intelligence."

The RNA methylase RlmN is a dual-specificity enzyme that can act on ribosomal and transfer RNA (tRNA). RlmN is a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme, which produces a protein/RNA cross-linked intermediate. Schwalm et al. determined the structure of RlmN cross-linked to a tRNA substrate and found that the enzyme recognizes the overall shape of the tRNA. Then it remodels the anticodon region to access the base that it methylates. The remodeling activity is likely to be key to the enzyme's dual specificity. Science , this issue p. 309"

https://openalex.org/W2341542390,"Mammalian microRNA expression is dysregulated in human cancer. However, the functional relevance of many microRNAs in the context of tumor biology remains unclear. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we performed a global loss-of-function screen to simultaneously test the functions of individual microRNAs and protein-coding genes during the growth of a myeloid leukemia cell line. This approach identified evolutionarily conserved human microRNAs that suppress or promote cell growth, revealing that microRNAs are extensively integrated into the molecular networks that control tumor cell physiology. miR-155 was identified as a top microRNA candidate promoting cellular fitness, which we confirmed with two distinct miR-155-targeting CRISPR-Cas9 lentiviral constructs. Further, we performed anti-correlation functional profiling to predict relevant microRNA-tumor suppressor gene or microRNA-oncogene interactions in these cells. This analysis identified miR-150 targeting of p53, a connection that was experimentally validated. Taken together, our study describes a powerful genetic approach by which the function of individual microRNAs can be assessed on a global level, and its use will rapidly advance our understanding of how microRNAs contribute to human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2341898420,"The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) MEAM1, is considered a serious pest of horticultural and many other crops. While eggplant (Solanum melongena) is one of the most favored host plants, the whiteflies exhibit preferences among different varieties. We hypothesized that certain morphological leaf characteristics of different varieties, like leaf trichome density, trichome length, leaf lamina thickness and leaf color, may affect whitefly landing, feeding and oviposition. In this study, we investigated the variation in leaf morphological characters among selected eggplant varieties and evaluated the effect of these leaf characteristics in rendering eggplant varieties either susceptible or resistant to B. tabaci. We evaluated eight eggplant varieties in choice feeding tests, and we found that the varieties JinSheng Zilongchangqie (JSZ) and H149 were the highly preferred varieties with the highest numbers of whitefly adults and eggs. Significantly lower numbers of whitefly adult eggs were found on the resistant variety Tuo Lu Bamu (TLB). The varieties JinGuangbo Luqie (JGL), JinGuangbo Ziquanqie (JGZ), DaYang Ziguanqie (DYZ), QinXing Ziguanqie (QXZ), and QinXing Niuxinqie (QXN) were moderately favored by B. tabaci. Leaf trichome density, trichome length and leaf lamina thickness were positively correlated with numbers of whitefly adults and eggs. B. tabaci was less attracted to the leaves that reflect long and middle wavelength light (higher R and G values) than to the bright green leaves (medium G value), but the short wavelength light (higher B value) had no significant effect on whitefly preference. The degree of hue had a positive effect, and saturation and brightness had a negative effect on whitefly attraction."
https://openalex.org/W2338521186,"Within the ovarian follicle, immature oocytes are surrounded and supported by granulosa cells (GCs). Stimulation of GCs by FSH leads to their proliferation and differentiation, events that are necessary for fertility. FSH activates multiple signaling pathways to regulate genes necessary for follicular maturation. Herein, we investigated the role of Y-box-binding protein-1 (YB-1) within GCs. YB-1 is a nucleic acid binding protein that regulates transcription and translation. Our results show that FSH promotes an increase in the phosphorylation of YB-1 on Ser102 within 15 min that is maintained at significantly increased levels until ∼8 h post treatment. FSH-stimulated phosphorylation of YB-1(Ser102) is prevented by pretreatment of GCs with the PKA-selective inhibitor PKA inhibitor (PKI), the MEK inhibitor PD98059, or the ribosomal S6 kinase-2 (RSK-2) inhibitor BI-D1870. Thus, phosphorylation of YB-1 on Ser102 is PKA-, ERK-, and RSK-2-dependent. However, pretreatment of GCs with the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitor tautomycin increased phosphorylation of YB-1(Ser102) in the absence of FSH; FSH did not further increase YB-1(Ser102) phosphorylation. This result suggests that the major effect of RSK-2 is to inhibit PP1 rather than to directly phosphorylate YB-1 on Ser102. YB-1 coimmunoprecipitated with PP1β catalytic subunit and RSK-2. Transduction of GCs with the dephospho-adenoviral-YB-1(S102A) mutant prevented the induction by FSH of Egfr, Cyp19a1, Inha, Lhcgr, Cyp11a1, Hsd17b1, and Pappa mRNAs and estradiol-17β production.

https://openalex.org/W2335866586,"Although rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors can exist as both monomers and non-covalently associated dimers/oligomers, the steady-state proportion of each form and whether this is regulated by receptor ligands are unknown. Herein we address these topics for the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a key molecular target for novel cognition enhancers, by using spatial intensity distribution analysis. This method can measure fluorescent particle concentration and assess oligomerization states of proteins within defined regions of living cells. Imaging and analysis of the basolateral surface of cells expressing some 50 molecules·μm(-2) human muscarinic M1 receptor identified a ∼75:25 mixture of receptor monomers and dimers/oligomers. Both sustained and shorter term treatment with the selective M1 antagonist pirenzepine resulted in a large shift in the distribution of receptor species to favor the dimeric/oligomeric state. Although sustained treatment with pirenzepine also resulted in marked up-regulation of the receptor, simple mass action effects were not the basis for ligand-induced stabilization of receptor dimers/oligomers. The related antagonist telenzepine also produced stabilization and enrichment of the M1 receptor dimer population, but the receptor subtype non-selective antagonists atropine and N-methylscopolamine did not. In contrast, neither pirenzepine nor telenzepine altered the quaternary organization of the related M3 muscarinic receptor. These data provide unique insights into the selective capacity of receptor ligands to promote and/or stabilize receptor dimers/oligomers and demonstrate that the dynamics of ligand regulation of the quaternary organization of G protein-coupled receptors is markedly more complex than previously appreciated. This may have major implications for receptor function and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2337055769,"Fabry nephropathy is associated with progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL3) in podocytes. Reducing this GL3 burden may reduce podocyte injury. Sensitive methods to quantify podocyte GL3 content may determine whether a given strategy can benefit podocytes in Fabry disease. We developed an unbiased electron microscopic stereological method to estimate the average volume of podocytes and their GL3 inclusions in 6 paired pre- and post-enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) biopsies from 5 men with Fabry disease. Podocyte GL3 content was regularly reduced (average 73%) after 11-12 months of ERT. This was not detectable using a semi-quantitative approach. Parallel to GL3 reduction, podocytes became remarkably smaller (average 63%). These reductions in podocyte GL3 content or size were not significantly correlated with changes in foot process width (FPW). However, FPW after ERT was significantly correlated with the magnitude of the decrease in podocyte GL3 content from baseline to 11-12 months of ERT. Also podocytes exocytosed GL3 inclusions, a phenomenon correlated with their reduction in their GL3 content. Demonstrable after11-12 months, reduction in podocyte GL3 content allows for early assessment of treatment efficacy and shorter clinical trials in Fabry disease."
https://openalex.org/W2341727529,"A field micro-plot experiment using nitrogen isotope (15N) labeling was conducted to determine the effects of placement methods (broadcast and band) and N rates (60, 150 and 240 kg ha-1) on the fate of urea-15N in the wheat-soil system in Guangde County of Anhui Province, China. N fertilizer applied in bands increased grain yield by 15% compared with broadcast application. The N fertilizer application rate had a significant effect on grain yield, straw yield and aboveground biomass, as well as on N uptake and N concentration of wheat. The recovery of urea-15N was a little higher for broadcast (34.0-39.0%) than for band treatment (31.2-38.2%). Most of the soil residual N was retained in the 0-20 cm soil layer. At the N rates of 60 and 240 kg ha-1, the residual 15N was higher for band (34.4 and 108.7 kg ha-1, respectively) than for broadcast application (29.6 and 88.4 kg ha-1, respectively). Compared with broadcast treatment, banded placement of N fertilizer decreased the N loss in the wheat-soil system.

https://openalex.org/W2336349293,"Inequity aversion has been proposed to act as a limiting factor for cooperation, thus preventing subjects from disadvantageous cooperative interactions. While a recent study revealed that also dogs show some sensitivity to inequity, the underlying mechanisms of this behaviour are still unclear. The aim of the current study was threefold: 1) to replicate the study by Range et al. (2009, PNAS, 106, 340-345); 2) to investigate the emotional mechanisms involved in the inequity response by measuring the heart rate and 3) to explore the link between inequity aversion and cooperation in terms of behaviours shown towards the partner dog and towards the experimenter who caused the inequity. Dog tested in dyads were alternately asked to give their paw and were either equally or unequally rewarded by the experimenter. After each social test condition, we conducted food tolerance tests and free interaction tests in which the subjects' social behaviour towards the partner and the experimenter were observed. As in the previous study, subjects refused to continue giving their paw when only the partner was rewarded, but not when both dogs were rewarded with rewards of different quality. Although subjects did not react to this quality inequity during the test, we did find reduced durations of food sharing in the subsequent tolerance test, indicating that dogs perceived the inequity but were not able to react to it in the test context. Moreover, subjects avoided their partner and the experimenter more during the free interaction time following unequal compared to equal treatment. Despite the clear behavioural reactions to inequity, we could not detect any changes in heart rate. Results suggest that inequity aversion might in fact be mediated by simple emotional mechanisms: sharing a negative experience, like inequity, might reduce future cooperation by decreasing the likelihood of proximity being maintained between partners."
https://openalex.org/W2336395638,"Post-operative adhesions are a critical problem in pelvic and abdominal surgery despite a multitude of studies dedicated to finding modalities to prevent their occurrence. Ghrelin administration promotes an anti-fibrotic response in a surgical mouse model of adhesion-induction, but the mechanisms mediating this effect have not been established. In the current study, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the anti-adhesion effect of ghrelin were investigated. Post-surgical adhesions were experimentally created in C57BL/6 wild-type mice via a combination of ischemic peritoneal buttons and cecal multiple abrasions. Ghrelin or saline intraperitoneal injections were given twice daily from two days before surgery to selected time points post-surgically to assess the phenotypic and molecular effects of treatment (1 day (n = 20), 4 days (n = 20) and 20 days (n = 40) after surgery). Endpoints included the scoring of adhesions and gene and protein expression analysis of pro-fibrogenic factors conducted on peritoneal ischemic tissue by quantitative PCR and Western blot. Ghrelin administration significantly reduced post-surgical adhesions and down-regulated pro-inflammatory gene and protein expression, including Tgfb3 and Tgfbr2. The up-regulation of inhibitory proteins Smad6 and Smad7 confirmed the ghrelin-induced blockage of TGF-β signaling. Ghrelin is a candidate therapeutic drug for post-operative adhesion prevention, inhibiting inflammatory responses via blockage of the TGF-β signaling pathway at the onset of surgery before the occurrence of the granulation-remodeling phase."

Chronic inflammation is considered a pathological issue for aggravating insulin resistance (13Heilbronn L.K. Campbell L.V.

However, the effect of IMD on inflammation aggravated insulin resistance remains largely unknown. In a bacterial LPS-induced atypical orchitis rat model, IMD attenuated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β (15Hotamisligil G.S. Inflammation and metabolic disorders.Nature. 2006; 444: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (6241) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of IMD was observed in atopic dermatitis (16Kindt F. Wiegand S. Löser C.

In this study, we explored the effects of IMD on macrophage inflammation and adipose insulin resistance. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) indicates a plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level >10 μmol/liter. Evidence showed that Hcy induced the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages in both mice and humans (17Zeng X. Dai J. Remick D.G. Wang X.

A meta-analysis and Mendelian randomization analysis from 4011 cases and 4303 controls showed a causal association of Hcy level with the development of type 2 diabetes in humans (21Huang T. Ren J. Huang J. Li D. Association of homocysteine with type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis implementing Mendelian randomization approach.BMC Genomics. 2013; 14: 867Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our previous studies revealed that HHcy induces insulin resistance and adipokine resistin elevation from adipocytes (22Li Y. Jiang C. Xu G. Wang N. Zhu Y. Tang C. Wang X. Homocysteine upregulates resistin production from adipocytes in vivo and in vitro.Diabetes. 2008; 57: 817-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In a mechanism study of HHcy promoting insulin resistance, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), inflammation pathway activation, and macrophage infiltration were found to be induced by HHcy in adipocytes and adipose tissues (23Li Y.

Insulin resistance was promoted by a transition in macrophage polarization from an alternative M2 state to a pro-inflammatory M1 state (13Heilbronn L.K. Campbell L.V.

It has been reported that HHcy promotes inflammatory monocyte differentiation (19Zhang D. Fang P. Jiang X. Nelson J. Moore J.K. Kruger W.D. Berretta R.M. Houser S.R. Yang X. Wang H. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia promotes bone marrow-derived and resident inflammatory monocyte differentiation and atherosclerosis in LDLr/CBS-deficient mice.Circ. Res. 2012; 111: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Combined with LPS, Hcy induced the M1 polarization of a macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, in vitro (26Gao S. Wang L. Liu W. Wu Y.

(Lond.). 2014; 11: 13Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, whether HHcy regulates the M1/M2 balance in insulin-resistant mice and the effects of IMD in HHcy-induced insulin resistance remain unknown. Our study aimed to explore the mechanisms of HHcy-enhanced ERS and the consequent insulin resistance in adipocytes and the effects of IMD on these processes, revealing IMD as a novel factor on HHcy-induced insulin resistance in adipose tissues of mice. dl-Homocysteine was from Sigma. Antibodies against pAKT (Ser-473), AKT, phosphorylated protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (pPERK), PERK, p-eIF2α, eIF2α, GAPDH, β actin, p-JNK, p-P65, pAMPKα, and AMPKα were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The antibody against inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against ATF6 and arginase 1 (Arg1) were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). The antibody against t-JNK was from Invitrogen. Recombined human IMD and the antibody against IMD were from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Belmont, CA). All studies followed the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. For the HHcy mouse model, male C57BL/6J mice, 6 weeks old, were fed normal mouse chow with or without 1.8 g/liter dl-Hcy added to the drinking water for 4 weeks, as described previously (20Dai J. Li W. Chang L. Zhang Z. Tang C. Wang N. Zhu Y. Wang X. Role of redox factor-1 in hyperhomocysteinemia-accelerated atherosclerosis.Free Radic. Biol.

Alzet osmotic minipumps (model 2004) containing 318 ng/kg/h IMD or saline were implanted subcutaneously into male C57BL/6J mice for infusion. After 3 days, the mice were fed Hcy in drinking water for 4 weeks. For adipocyte-specific IMD overexpression (Adipo-IMD-tg) mice, human intermedin gene expression was driven by the Fabp4 promoter in mice with a C57BL/6J background. For the glucose tolerance tests (GTTs), mice were fasted for 12 h and then injected with glucose (3 g/kg body weight) intraperitoneally. For the insulin tolerance test (ITT), mice were fasted for 4 h, and then 2 IU/kg insulin was injected intraperitoneally. Blood glucose levels were evaluated at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 min. After 3 days of adaptation, mice were killed. Blood, epididymal fat pads, and subcutaneous fat pads were taken. Body composition was measured in nonanesthetized mice using an EchoMRITM device (Echo Medical Systems). The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index was calculated by using the following formula: [fasting insulin (mIU) × fasting glucose (mmol/liter)]/22.5. Mouse plasma IMD was detected using an ELISA kit from Cloud-Clone Corp. No significant cross-reactivity or interference between IMD and analogues was observed. Real-time PCR amplification involved the use of an Mx3000 Multiplex quantitative PCR system (Stratagene Corp., La Jolla, CA) and SYBR Green I reagent with normalization to the internal control β-actin. The following primers for real-time PCR were used: Cd11c, 5′-GGATCTGGGATGCTGAAATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGTCTGGCAGATGTGGCTA-3′ (antisense); Cd206, 5′-CAGGTGTGGGCTCAGGTAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGCATGTCCTGGAATGAT-3′ (antisense); Imd, 5′-CCCTTCCCTTCAGCCTGTAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGGCGATGGCTAAGATTCTG-3′ (antisense); Il-12, 5′-CTGTGCCTTGGTAGCATCTATG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCAGAGTCTCGCCATTATGATTC-3′ (antisense); Il-10, 5′-GCTCTTACTGACTGGCATGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCAGCTCTAGGAGCATGTG-3′ (antisense); inos, 5′-GGAGTGACGGCAAACATGACT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCGATGCACAACTGGGTGAAC-3′ (antisense); and Arg1, 5′-TTTTTCCAGCAGACCAGCTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGAGATTATCGGAGCGCCTT-3′ (antisense). Cell or mouse tissue extracts containing equal amounts of total protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE (15% SDS-PAGE for IMD) for Western blotting analysis. The blots were incubated with primary antibodies and IRDye 700DX-conjugated secondary antibodies (Rockland Inc.). For the primary antibody dilution, 1:500 dilution was used for iNOS, and 1:1000 dilutions were used for the other antibodies. The immunofluorescence signal was detected by Odyssey infrared imaging (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). AMPK siRNA was designed and chemically modified by the manufacturer (Ribobio). Sequences corresponding to the siRNA of AMPK were as follows: sense, 5-GCAGAAGAUUCGGAGCCUU dTdT-3; antisense, 3-dTdT CGUCUUCUAAGCCUCGGAA-5. Transfection of mouse peritoneal macrophages with the siRNA (50 nmol/l) in vitro was performed with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Adipose tissues were minced and digested with 1 mg/ml type I collagenase for 40 min. After centrifugation, stromal vascular fractions were collected at the bottom of the tubes. Then the stromal vascular fractions were stained with the macrophage marker F4/80 allophycocyanin, the dead cell marker 7-aminoactinomycin D, the M2 marker CD206 FITC, and the M1 marker CD11c phycoerythrin (BD Biosciences) and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Mouse peritoneal macrophages were treated with 300 μm Hcy, 20 nm IMD, or Hcy+IMD for 24 h in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% FBS. Cells were then used for M1/M2 marker or pAMPK detection. For the co-culture assay, the cells were changed to fresh medium for an additional 24 h. Subsequently, cell culture supernatants were collected. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in growth medium, high-glucose DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS. Two days post-confluence, cells were induced to differentiate with a standard mixture consisting of growth medium with 1 μmol/liter dexamethasone, 10 μg/ml bovine insulin, and 0.25 mmol/liter 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After 3 days in differentiation medium, cells were treated with growth medium with 10 μg/ml bovine insulin for 3 days and then maintained in growth medium alone. Cells were considered mature adipocytes 8 days post-induction of differentiation and then treated with supernatant from cultured macrophages for 24 h. All data are reported as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software. Statistical analysis involved one-way analysis of variance for multiple comparisons, then Tukey-Kramer post-hoc testing, and Student's unpaired t test for comparisons between two groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. After being fed with 1.8 g/liter Hcy in the drinking water for 4 weeks, HHcy mice displayed insulin resistance (23Li Y. Zhang H. Jiang C. Xu M. Pang Y. Feng J. Xiang X. Kong W. Xu G. Li Y. Wang X. Hyperhomocysteinemia promotes insulin resistance by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress in adipose tissue.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 9583-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To validate whether IMD plays a role in HHcy-induced insulin resistance, we detected the expression level of IMD in HHcy mice. Compared with controls, the plasma IMD levels of HHcy mice were markedly lower (Fig. 1A). IMD was abundant in adipose tissues compared with livers or skeletal muscles (Fig. 1B). Thus, we proposed that adipose tissue is the pivotal organ where IMD participates in glucose metabolism. Consistent with systemic IMD down-regulation, the mRNA and protein levels of IMD were apparently decreased in the adipose tissues of HHcy mice (Fig. 1, B and C). To investigate the role of adipocyte IMD in HHcy-mediated insulin resistance, we generated adipose tissue (Fabp4)-specific knockin IMD gene (Adipo-IMD-tg) mice. Adipo-IMD-tg mice showed an accurate transgenic gene band, but wild-type mice did not (data not shown). The mRNA levels of IMD were substantially increased in epididymal white adipose tissues (eWAT) but not in livers or skeletal muscles (Fig. 2A). It was reported that Fabp4 is expressed in macrophages (27Makowski L. Boord J.B. Maeda K. Babaev V.R. Uysal K.T. Morgan M.A. Parker R.A. Suttles J. Fazio S. Hotamisligil G.S. Linton M.F. Lack of macrophage fatty-acid-binding protein aP2 protects mice deficient in apolipoprotein E against atherosclerosis.Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Therefore, the expression of the IMD transgene in macrophages was also investigated. Adipo-IMD-tg mice exhibited significantly enhanced protein levels of IMD in eWAT, whereas no changes in IMD expression in macrophages were detected (Fig. 2B). The body weights of Adipo-IMD-tg mice were similar to those of controls after feeding with Hcy for 4 weeks (Fig. 2C). The fat-to-weight ratio in Adipo-IMD-tg mice was similar to those of controls (Fig. 2D). No difference was observed in the size of adipocytes in eWAT tissues from Adipo-IMD-tg mice and control mice (Fig. 2E). Consistent with our data published previously (23Li Y. Zhang H. Jiang C. Xu M. Pang Y. Feng J. Xiang X. Kong W. Xu G. Li Y. Wang X. Hyperhomocysteinemia promotes insulin resistance by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress in adipose tissue.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 9583-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), HHcy mice had impaired insulin sensitivity, as verified by GTT and ITT (data not shown). However, the GTT and ITT results indicated improved glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance, respectively, in Adipo-IMD-tg mice with HHcy (Fig. 2F). Moreover, fasted serum insulin levels and the HOMA index were significantly reduced in Adipo-IMD-tg mice (Fig. 2G). The insulin sensitivity indicator phosphorylated AKT (Ser-473) was reduced in adipose tissues of HHcy mice but elevated in the Adipo-IMD-tg mouse group (Fig. 2H). These results indicated that IMD overexpression ameliorates systemic and adipose tissue insulin resistance in HHcy mice. To further explore the mechanisms underlying IMD-ameliorated insulin resistance with HHcy, the balance of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages was detected in the adipose tissues of Adipo-IMD-tg mice. In a flow cytometry assay gated on F4/80-positive macrophages, CD11c was labeled as M1, whereas CD206 was labeled as an M2 marker (28Fujisaka S. Usui I. Bukhari A. Ikutani M. Oya T. Kanatani Y. Tsuneyama K. Nagai Y. Takatsu K. Urakaze M. Kobayashi M. Tobe K. Regulatory mechanisms for adipose tissue M1 and M2 macrophages in diet-induced obese mice.Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2574-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In eWAT, an increased proportion of M2 macrophages was observed in Adipo-IMD-tg mice (Fig. 3A). Moreover, a reduced percentage of M1 macrophages was observed in subcutaneous white adipose tissues (Fig. 3B). This imbalance of M1/M2 was further confirmed by examination of cell surface markers (CD11C for M1 and CD206 for M2), cytokines (IL-12 for M1 and IL-10 for M2), and enzymes (iNOS for M1 and Arg1 for M2). Elevated mRNA expression of M2 markers, including Cd206, Il-10, and Arg1, and reduced mRNA expression of inos were observed in the eWAT of Adipo-IMD-tg mice compared with control mice (Fig. 3C). To verify the effect of IMD on the M1/M2 cell balance in vitro, thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were administered (300 μm Hcy, 20 nm IMD, or 300 μm Hcy + 20 nm IMD) for 24 h. The expressions of M1 and M2 macrophage markers were detected. The administration of IMD reversed Hcy-induced M1 macrophage marker expression (i.e. Cd11c and iNOS; Fig. 4, A, C, and E), whereas it recovered Hcy-inhibited M2 macrophage marker expression (i.e. Cd206, Il-10, and Arg1; Fig. 4, A, B, D, and E). These data indicate that IMD improves the Hcy-induced M1/M2 imbalance.FIGURE 4IMD ameliorated the Hcy-induced M1/M2 imbalance in vitro. A–D, peritoneal macrophages were treated with Hcy, IMD, or Hcy + IMD.

It has recently been reported that the depletion of AMPK in hematopoietic cells inhibits M2 macrophages but promotes M1 macrophage activation (29Galic S. Fullerton M.D. Schertzer J.D. Sikkema S. Marcinko K. Walkley C.R. Izon D. Honeyman J. Chen Z.P. van Denderen B.J. Kemp B.E. Steinberg G.R. Hematopoietic AMPK β1 reduces mouse adipose tissue macrophage inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 4903-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The AMPK pathway was further detected in macrophages treated with Hcy and IMD alone or in combination. The phosphorylation of AMPKα was inhibited by Hcy treatment but was reversed by IMD in macrophages (Fig. 5A). To address the effect of AMPK on Hcy- or IMD-mediated macrophage polarization, the activity of AMPK was abolished by siRNA. Around half of the AMPK expression was knocked down by AMPK siRNA (Fig. 5B). Although IMD reversed the Hcy-induced M1/M2 imbalance, knockdown of AMPK diminished these effects. Moreover, the protein expression of ARG1 was markedly reduced, whereas iNOS expression was enhanced by siAMPK transfection (Fig. 5, C and D). These results suggest that IMD reverses the Hcy-induced M1/M2 imbalance through the AMPK pathway. Previous studies from our group showed that HHcy enhances ER stress and insulin resistance in adipocytes. The PERK and ATF6 pathways were involved rather than the XBP1 pathway (23Li Y. Zhang H. Jiang C. Xu M. Pang Y. Feng J. Xiang X. Kong W. Xu G. Li Y. Wang X. Hyperhomocysteinemia promotes insulin resistance by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress in adipose tissue.J. Biol.

To address the effect of IMD on HHcy-primed ER stress, adipose tissues from Adipo-IMD-tg mice were analyzed regarding the PERK and ATF6 signaling pathways. Compared with controls, Adipo-IMD-tg mice displayed reduced phosphorylated PERK (pPERK) and phosphorylated eIF2α (peIF2α) levels in adipose tissues with HHcy. Activated/cleaved ATF6 was also repressed in adipose tissues of Adipo-IMD-tg mice (Fig. 6, A and B). Our results suggest that, under the HHcy condition, overexpression of IMD attenuates the ER stress pathways in adipose tissues. Inflammation promotes HHcy-induced insulin resistance in adipocytes and triggers the activation of JNK, which is downstream of ERS in adipocytes (23Li Y. Zhang H. Jiang C. Xu M. Pang Y. Feng J.

Cryptococcosis is initiated as a pulmonary infection and in conditions of immune deficiency disseminates to the blood stream and central nervous system, resulting in life-threatening meningoencephalitis. A number of studies have focused on the development of a vaccine against Cryptococcus, primarily utilizing protein-conjugated components of the Cryptococcus polysaccharide capsule as antigen. However, there is currently no vaccine against Cryptococcus in the clinic. Previous studies have shown that the glycosphingolipid, glucosylceramide (GlcCer), is a virulence factor in C. neoformans and antibodies against this lipid inhibit fungal growth and cell division. In the present study, we have investigated the possibility of using GlcCer as a therapeutic agent against C. neoformans infections in mouse models of cryptococcosis. GlcCer purified from a non-pathogenic fungus, Candida utilis, was administered intraperitoneally, prior to infecting mice with a lethal dose of C. neoformans. GlcCer administration prevented the dissemination of C. neoformans from the lungs to the brain and led to 60% mouse survival. GlcCer administration did not cause hepatic injury and elicited an anti-GlcCer antibody response, which was observed independent of the route of administration and the strains of mouse. Taken together, our results suggest that fungal GlcCer can protect mice against lethal doses of C. neoformans infection and can provide a viable vaccination strategy against Cryptococcus."

The propagation of different fibril polymorphs is thought to be a contributing factor to phenotypic diversity in Alzheimer disease and other Tauopathies. We found that a homogeneous population of Tau fibrils composed of the truncated version K18 (residues 244–372) gradually converted to a new set of fibril conformers when subjected to multiple cycles of seeding and growth. Using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, we observed that the distances between spin labels at positions 311 and 328 in the fibril core progressively decreased. The findings were corroborated by changes in turbidity, morphology, and protease sensitivity. Fibrils that were initially formed under stirring conditions exhibited an increased fragility compared with fibrils formed quiescently after multiple cycles of seeding. The quiescently formed fibrils were marked by accelerated growth. The difference in fragility and growth between the different conformers explains how the change in incubation condition could lead to the amplification of a minor subpopulation of fibrils. Under quiescent conditions where fibril breakage is minimal, faster growing fibrils have a selective advantage. The findings are of general importance as they suggest that changes in selective pressures during fibril propagation in the human brain could result in the emergence of new fibril conformers with varied clinicopathological consequences.

This study investigated the influence of social inequalities on the (i) access to renal transplant waiting list, (ii) access to renal transplantation and (iii) patients' survival.All incident adult patients with end-stage renal disease who lived in Bretagne, a French region, and started dialysis during the 2004-2009 period were geocoded in census-blocks. To each census-block was assigned a level of neighborhood deprivation and a degree of urbanization. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with each study outcome.Patients living in neighborhoods with low level of deprivation had more chance to be placed on the waiting list and less risk of death (HR = 1.40 95%CI: [1.1-1.7]; HR = 0.82 95%CI: [0.7-0.98]), but this association did not remain after adjustment for the patients' clinical features. The likelihood of receiving renal transplantation after being waitlisted was not associated with neighborhood deprivation in univariate and multivariate analyses.In a mixed rural and urban French region, patients living in deprived or advantaged neighborhoods had the same chance to be placed on the waiting list and to undergo renal transplantation. They also showed the same mortality risk, when their clinical features were taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W2339083393,"Mutations in the gene for polycystin 2 (Pkd2) lead to polycystic kidney disease, however the main cause of mortality in humans is cardiac related. We previously showed that 5 month old Pkd2+/- mice have altered calcium-contractile activity in cardiomyocytes, but have preserved cardiac function. Here, we examined 1 and 9 month old Pkd2+/- mice to determine if decreased amounts of functional polycystin 2 leads to impaired cardiac function with aging. We observed changes in calcium handling proteins in 1 month old Pkd2+/- mice, and these changes were exacerbated in 9 month old Pkd2+/- mice. Anatomically, the 9 month old Pkd2+/- mice had thinner left ventricular walls, consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was decreased. Intriguingly, in response to acute isoproterenol stimulation to examine β-adrenergic responses, the 9 month old Pkd2+/- mice exhibited a stronger contractile response, which also coincided with preserved localization of the β2 adrenergic receptor. Importantly, the Pkd2+/- mice did not have any renal impairment. We conclude that the cardiac-related impact of decreased polycystin 2 progresses over time towards cardiac dysfunction and altered adrenergic signaling. These results provide further evidence that polycystin 2 provides a critical function in the heart, independent of renal involvement."
https://openalex.org/W2336194644,"Environmental insecurity is a source and outcome of biodiversity declines and social conflict. One challenge to scaling insecurity reduction policies is that empirical evidence about local attitudes is overwhelmingly missing. We set three objectives: determine how local people rank risk associated with different sources of environmental insecurity; assess perceptions of environmental insecurity, biodiversity exploitation, myths of nature and risk management preferences; and explore relationships between perceptions and biodiversity exploitation. We conducted interviews (N = 88) with residents of Madagascar's Torotorofotsy Protected Area, 2014. Risk perceptions had a moderate effect on perceptions of environmental insecurity. We found no effects of environmental insecurity on biodiversity exploitation. Results offer one if not the first exploration of local perceptions of illegal biodiversity exploitation and environmental security. Local people's perception of risk seriousness associated with illegal biodiversity exploitation such as lemur hunting (low overall) may not reflect perceptions of policy-makers (considered to be high). Discord is a key entry point for attention."

Therefore, the OGT/OGA pair accounts for all the reversible O-GlcNAcylation reactions in humans. Since its discovery in the early 1980s (2Torres C.R. Hart G.W.

These proteins participate in cancer, transcription, circadian clock, and Alzheimer diseases (1Hart G.W. Slawson C. Ramirez-Correa G. Lagerlof O.

O-GlcNAcylation has extensive cross-talk with phosphorylation and ubiquitination and takes part in numerous pathways. Many O-GlcNAcylation sites have been shown to occur adjacent to Ser/Thr sites known to be phosphorylated, thus competing for the same amino acids or posing a steric hindrance to the adjoining sites for other modifications.

The role of O-GlcNAcylation in the cell cycle has recently caught wide attention. Upon entering S phase, O-GlcNAcylation decreases globally (4Drougat L. Olivier-Van Stichelen S. Mortuaire M.

Histone 3 is O-GlcNAcylated on Thr-32 during mitosis, which antagonizes phosphorylation at Ser-10 (7Fong J.J. Nguyen B.L. Bridger R. Medrano E.E. Wells L. Pan S.

O-GlcNAc cycling regulates mitotic spindle organization, as increasing both OGT/OGA activity disrupts spindle structures (8Tan E.P. Caro S. Potnis A. Lanza C. Slawson C.

During cytokinesis, extensive cross-talk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation has also been observed (9Wang Z. Udeshi N.D. Slawson C. Compton P.D. Sakabe K. Cheung W.D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hart G.W. Extensive crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation regulates cytokinesis.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra2Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Specifically, the intermediate filament vimentin is O-GlcNAcylated at the midbody (10Slawson C. Lakshmanan T. Knapp S. Hart G.W.

Cell. 2008; 19: 4130-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here we identify O-GlcNAcylation occurring on Cdh1 (Cdc20 homologue 1; also known as Fzr1), a co-activator of anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). APC/C is a key multisubunit E3 ligase that orchestrates mitosis (11Sivakumar S. Gorbsky G.J. Spatiotemporal regulation of the anaphase-promoting complex in mitosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). APC/C works together with one of two co-activator proteins, Cdc20 or Cdh1, to ubiquitinate substrates and mediate proteasome-dependent degradation during mitosis. Cdh1 engages with APC/C through an N-terminal C-box motif (DRFIP, amino acid 46–50) and a C-terminal Ile-Arg (IR) tail (12Kimata Y. Baxter J.E. Fry A.M. Yamano H.

Atomic structure of the APC/C and its mechanism of protein ubiquitination.Nature. 2015; 522: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cdh1 is subject to myriad modifications. It is phosphorylated at Ser-40, Thr-121, Ser-151, and Ser-163 by cyclin E-CDK or cyclin A-CDK complexes (14Lukas C. Sørensen C.S. Kramer E. Santoni-Rugiu E. Lindeneg C. Peters J.M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Accumulation of cyclin B1 requires E2F and cyclin-A-dependent rearrangement of the anaphase-promoting complex.Nature. 1999; 401: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and a total of nine sites (including the four sites above) by Cdk1 during M phase (15Kramer E.R. Scheuringer N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Peters J.M. Mitotic regulation of the APC activator proteins CDC20 and CDH1.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1555-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), which attenuates its interaction with other subunits of APC/C. It is also ubiquitinated by itself and mediates its own demise (16Listovsky T. Oren Y.S. Yudkovsky Y. Mahbubani H.M. Weiss A.M. Lebendiker M. Brandeis M. Mammalian Cdh1/Fzr mediates its own degradation.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1619-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cdh1 maintains APC/C activity after anaphase and throughout G1 and prevents cell cycle re-entry until a cell commits to another round of cell division (11Sivakumar S. Gorbsky G.J. Spatiotemporal regulation of the anaphase-promoting complex in mitosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Besides the well documented role in mitosis, APC/CCdh1 is also pivotal for neuronal development (17Puram S.V. Bonni A. Novel functions for the anaphase-promoting complex in neurobiology.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 22: 586-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the mammalian brain, both APC/C core subunits and Cdh1 are abundant in post-mitotic neurons (18Gieffers C. Peters B.H. Kramer E.R. Dotti C.G. Peters J.M. Expression of the CDH1-associated form of the anaphase-promoting complex in postmitotic neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 11317-11322Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the chick brain, multiple Cdh1 homologues have been identified (19Wan Y. Kirschner M.W. Identification of multiple CDH1 homologues in vertebrates conferring different substrate specificities.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13066-13071Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In both mammals and flies, only Cdh1, but not Cdc20, activates APC/C function in neurons (20van Roessel P. Elliott D.A. Robinson I.M. Prokop A. Brand A.H. Independent regulation of synaptic size and activity by the anaphase-promoting complex.Cell. 2004; 119: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21Konishi Y.

This is in sharp contrast to mitotic regulation, where either Cdh1 or Cdc20 complexes with APC/C. A recent embryo-restricted Cdh1 knock-out mouse model showcased that an APC/CCdh1 complex is required for neurogenesis and cortical neuron development (22Delgado-Esteban M. García-Higuera I. Maestre C. Moreno S. Almeida A. APC/C-Cdh1 coordinates neurogenesis and cortical size during development.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because neurons are post-mitotic, they need an active APC/C-Cdh1 complex to degrade mitotic cyclins to suppress aberrant cell cycle reentry and subsequent neuronal deaths by apoptosis (23Veas-Pérez de Tudela M. Maestre C. Delgado-Esteban M. Bolaños J.P. Almeida A. Cdk5-mediated inhibition of APC/C-Cdh1 switches on the cyclin D1-Cdk4-pRb pathway causing aberrant S-phase entry of postmitotic neurons.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 18180Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, O-GlcNAc modification is most abundant in the brain. We thus suspect a link between Cdh1 and O-GlcNAc. In this report we show that Cdh1 is O-GlcNAcylated. Using higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) mass spectrometry (MS), we identify the peptide that is potentially O-GlcNAcylated. We propose that O-GlcNAcylated Cdh1 antagonizes its phosphorylation and promotes APC/CCdh1 activity. HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC. They were grown in DMEM (Hyclone) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Anti-OGT antibodies were from Santa Cruz (sc-32921), anti-O-GlcNAc antibodies (CTD110.6) were from Sigma, anti-O-GlcNAc antibodies (RL2) were from Abcam, anti-Cdc27 antibodies were from Bethyl Laboratories (BL4897), anti-phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro antibodies (MPM-2) were from Millipore (05-368), and anti-Cdh1 antibodies were from Abcam (ab3242).

OGT-N (1–473) and -C (474–1046) plasmids were generated by PCR. siOGT oligos were GCACGGCUCUGAAACUUAAdTdT, and the control siRNA oligos were CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT (both from Dharmacon). A double thymidine (an inhibitor of DNA synthesis) block was utilized for cell synchronization in S phase (Fig. 3A). For cells enriched in M phase, 340 nm/ml nocodazole (Noc) was added 9 h after release from the second thymidine block. 16 h later cells were collected. IP and IB experiments were performed as described before (24Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Chk2 activation and phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were treated with 340 nm/ml Noc for 14 h and then 2 μm Ro-3306 (CDK1 inhibitor) for 1 or 2 h (Fig. 3B), Noc for 16 h, 100 mm O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene) amino N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc; OGA inhibitor) for 24 h, and 30 mm glucose for 3 h (Fig. 3D). The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-OGT, anti-O-GlcNAc, anti-Cdh1, anti-Cdc27, anti-β-actin, anti-HA, and anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma). For IP with anti-OGT, -Cdc27, and -HA antibodies, protein A-Sepharose was used; for IP with anti-Cdh1, -FLAG antibodies, protein G-Sepharose was used; for IP with anti-O-GlcNAc IgM CTD110.6 antibodies, anti-mouse IgM-agarose beads were used. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Blotted proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were detected by an LAS-4000 and quantitatively analyzed by densitometry using the Multi Gauge software (Fujifilm). All Western blots were repeated for at least three times. The numbers reported for the densitometry were based on at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was measured by Student's t test. For silver staining HeLa cells transfected with wide-type (WT) CDH1 were incubated with 100 μm PUGNAc for 24 h and 30 mm glucose for 3 h. Cell lysates were subject to IP using anti-FLAG agarose. The bound proteins were glycine-eluted. Separated protein bands in the SDS-PAGE gel were visualized with an MS-compatible silver stain kit (Proteosilver Plus, Sigma). Samples were precipitated with 4 volumes of ice-cold acetone, air-dried, resuspended in 8 m urea, 100 mm pH 8.5 Tris buffer, and digested with trypsin (Promega) at 1:50 enzyme/protein ratio. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was performed on an Easy-nLC 1000 UPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded on a precolumn (75-μm inner diameter, 8 cm long, packed with ODS-AQ 12 nm–10 μm beads from YMC Co., Ltd.) and separated on an analytical column (75-μm inner diameter, 11 cm long, packed with Luna C18 3 μm 100 Å resin from Phenomenex) using an acetonitrile gradient from 0 to 28% in 55 min at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The top 10 most intense precursor ions from each full scan (resolution 70,000) were isolated for HCD MS2 (resolution 17,500; NCE 27) with a dynamic exclusion time of 20 s. Precursors with 1+, >5+, or unassigned charge states were excluded. A conventional database search using Prolucid (25Xu T. Venable J.D. Park S.K. Cociorva D. Lu B. Liao J. Wohlschlegel J. Hewel J. Yates 3rd, J. ProLuCID, a fast and sensitive tandem mass spectra-based protein identification program.Mol. Cell.

Search results were filtered using DTASelect 2.0 with 10 ppm mass accuracy for precursor mass and a 1% false discovery rate cutoff at the spectral level (26Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R.

GlcNAc specific reporters were also labeled (126.05495, 138.05495, 144.06551, 168.06552, 186.07608, 204.08665) (28Hahne H. Moghaddas Gholami A. Kuster B. Discovery of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in published large-scale proteome data.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11: 843-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In vitro APC/C ubiquitination assays were carried out as described (29Tang Z. Yu H. Functional analysis of the spindle-checkpoint proteins using an in vitro ubiquitination assay.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 281: 227-242PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG-CDH1-WT or -3A plasmids were transfected into 293T cells. The cells were harvested 48 h later for lysis, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-agarose beads, washed, and eluted. About 15 μg of FLAG-Cdh1-WT or -3A proteins were incubated with anti-Cdc27 beads (5 μl) at room temperature for 1 h. Then the beads were washed followed by adding 5.5-μl reaction buffers with an energy mix (150 μm HA-ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), 5 μm GST-cyclin B1, 5 μm E1, 2 μm E2 UbcH5c). After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with SDS sample buffers, loaded onto SDS-PAGE, and subjected to IB analysis. As many nucleocytoplasmic proteins are modified dynamically by O-GlcNAc (30Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Cycling of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine on nucleocytoplasmic proteins.Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar), we sought to assess whether Cdh1 is also regulated by such modifications. Because O-GlcNAcylation is extremely labile and easily escapes detection, the OGA inhibitor PUGNAc was utilized. HeLa cells treated with PUGNAc or mock-treated were subject to IP assays with anti-Cdh1 antibodies and blotted with anti-O-GlcNAc antibodies (CTD110.6). We detected a crisp O-GlcNAc band not only at positions corresponding to Cdh1 but also of increasing intensities upon PUGNAc treatment (Fig. 1A). Reciprocally, Cdh1 was also present in anti-O-GlcNAc antibody immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B). To exclude the possibility of the antibodies' fortuitous co-IP, FLAG-Cdh1 was transfected into HeLa cells, and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were subject to the same analysis as in Fig. 1A. We observed O-GlcNAcylation occurring on FLAG-Cdh1 (Fig. 1C). As all these experiments were performed in cultured cells, we sought to identify whether the modification also occurs in vivo. As Cdh1 is the only activator of APC/C in the brain, we used mouse brain extracts and detected O-GlcNAcylation of Cdh1 (Fig. 1D). Taken together, Cdh1 is O-GlcNAcylated in cell cultures and in vivo. The results above suggest that Cdh1 is subject to O-GlcNAcylation modification. Because mammals have only one OGT that catalyzes the reaction, we sought to examine whether Cdh1 associates with OGT. HeLa cell extracts were subject to IP with anti-OGT antibodies, and Cdh1 was identified in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A). HA-OGT and FLAG-CDH1 were transfected into HeLa cells, and IP assays were carried out with anti-FLAG antibodies. Again, the two proteins co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2B). Reciprocal co-IP between HA-OGT and FLAG-Cdh1 was also observed (Fig. 2C). These data further implicate Cdh1 in the OGT/OGA cycle. As OGT has N-terminal 13.5 tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) and a C-terminal enzymatic domain (ED) (31Janetzko J. Walker S. The making of a sweet modification: structure and function of O-GlcNAc transferase.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 34424-34432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we sought to determine which fragment of OGT interacts with Cdh1. OGT-TPR and -ED constructs were co-transfected with Cdh1 plasmids, and co-IP experiments were carried out (Fig. 2, D and E). FLAG-Cdh1 interacts with both OGT-TPR and -ED fragments, with the ED terminus displaying stronger interaction (Fig. 2E), suggesting that OGT indeed catalyzes Cdh1 O-GlcNAcylation. To identify the potential O-GlcNAcylation site of Cdh1, we enriched O-GlcNAcylation by treating the cells with PUGNAc and glucose as described (32Ramakrishnan P. Clark P.M. Mason D.E. Peters E.C. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. Baltimore D. Activation of the transcriptional function of the NF-κB protein c-Rel by O-GlcNAc glycosylation.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: ra75Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Glucose treatment further enhanced O-GlcNAcylation levels of Cdh1 compared with PUGNAc treatment only (Fig. 1C). The same assay was carried out on a larger scale, and the samples were subject to silver staining (Fig. 3A) before HCD-MS analysis (Fig. 3B). Cdh1 bands were in-solution-digested with trypsin, and the peptides were analyzed by MS. With the sequence coverage of 85% of Cdh1, we identified one O-GlcNAc-modified peptide revealing three potential O-GlcNAcylation sites: Ser-39, Ser-40, or Ser-42 (Fig. 3B). We noted that Ser-39 conforms to the PVST (proline-valine-serine-threonine) motif that is conserved in about half of the O-GlcNAcylated proteins identified to date (1Hart G.W. Slawson C. Ramirez-Correa G. Lagerlof O. Cross-talk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation: roles in signaling, transcription, and chronic disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 825-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). To further validate the modification site, we constructed S39A, S40A, and S42A single mutants and a S39A/S40A/S42A (3A) triple mutant by mutagenesis and transfected them into HeLa cells. Although the WT Cdh1 elevated O-GlcNAcylation upon PUGNAc and glucose incubation, O-GlcNAcylation in the 3A mutant was significantly diminished (Fig. 3, D and E). We used both RL2 and CTD110.6 antibodies, as they target to distinct antigens, whereas both recognize the O-GlcNAc group. Thus, we identified Ser-39/Ser-40/Ser-42 as the major O-GlcNAcylation sites of Cdh1. Previous investigations have established that Cdh1 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 during mitosis at nine Ser/Thr sites, including the four sites shown in Fig. 4A, which dampens its interaction with other components of APC/C and inactivates APC/CCdh1 (14Lukas C.

Moreover, the peptide we identified harbors Ser-40 (Fig. 3B), which is one of the phosphorylation sites (14Lukas C. Sørensen C.S. Kramer E. Santoni-Rugiu E. Lindeneg C. Peters J.M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Accumulation of cyclin B1 requires E2F and cyclin-A-dependent rearrangement of the anaphase-promoting complex.Nature. 1999; 401: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 15Kramer E.R.

Therefore, we examined O-GlcNAcylation of Cdh1 in the event of its phosphorylation. HeLa cells were blocked with thymidine before being released into Noc. Mitotic extracts were then analyzed by Western blotting. Echoing previous results, mitotic Cdh1 displays a distinct band migration compared with asynchronous cells (Fig. 4B), indicative of mitosis-specific phosphorylation. Intriguingly, the O-GlcNAcylation of Cdh1 decreased to ∼ 40% during mitosis (Fig. 4B), suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation of Cdh1 may be antagonistic of each other, reminiscent of the yin-yang model (1Hart G.W. Slawson C. Ramirez-Correa G. Lagerlof O. Cross-talk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation: roles in signaling, transcription, and chronic disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 825-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). To further characterize the cross-talk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, we aimed to prevent mitotic phosphorylation of Cdh1 by inhibiting Cdk1. We reasoned that O-GlcNAcylation of Cdh1 will be altered upon Cdk1 inhibition, even when cells are in the mitotic phase. HeLa cells were incubated with Ro-3306, a Cdk1 inhibitor (33Vassilev L.T. Tovar C. Chen S. Knezevic D. Zhao X. Sun H. Heimbrook D.C. Chen L. Selective small-molecule inhibitor reveals critical mitotic functions of human CDK1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10660-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), for 1 or 2 h after Noc-induced mitotic arrest. When only treated with Noc, the O-GlcNAcylation of Cdh1 was reduced (Fig. 4C). Upon Ro-3306 incubation, HeLa cells display higher levels of O-GlcNAcylation of Cdh1. Prolonged treatment of Ro-3306 further elevates O-GlcNAcylation of Cdh1 (Fig. 4C), suggesting that phosphorylation of Cdh1 counteracts O-GlcNAcylation. To study the O-GlcNAcylation of phospho-mutants, we constructed the phospho-deficient 4A and phospho-mimic 4D mutants, as previous investigations established them as the major Cdk-dependent phosphorylation sites (14Lukas C. Sørensen C.S. Kramer E. Santoni-Rugiu E. Lindeneg C. Peters J.M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Accumulation of cyclin B1 requires E2F and cyclin-A-dependent rearrangement of the anaphase-promoting complex.Nature. 1999; 401: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with WT, 4A, and 4D plasmids, incubated with PUGNAc and glucose, then subject to Noc treatment (Fig. 4D). The phospho-deficient 4A mutant enhanced O-GlcNAcylation compared with WT, whereas the phospho-mimicking 4D mutant displayed lower levels of O-GlcNAcylation (Fig. 4E). To directly visualize whether lacking OGT promotes Cdh1 phosphorylation, we used MPM-2 antibodies, which recognize a p(S/T)P phospho-epitope, characteristic of Cdk substrates. HeLa cells were treated with siOGT or mock-treated, transfected with FLAG-Cdh1, and subject to IP. Upon OGT inhibition, FLAG-Cdh1 immunoprecipitates manifest an elevated phosphorylation, discernable through MPM-2 IB (Fig. 4F). This is also in line with our hypothesis that O-GlcNAcylation offsets phosphorylation. Given that OGT is essential for survival and, therefore, Fig. 4F might be an indirect effect, we directly tested the MPM-2 levels of Cdh1 mutants (Fig. 4G). HeLa cells transfected with Cdh1-WT, S40A, 3A, and 4A mutants were treated with Noc, then the MPM-2 levels were examined in the immunoprecipitates. As expected, the phospho-deficient S40A and 4A mutants significantly hampered Cdh1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4G). The 3A mutant enhanced MPM-2 levels compared with the S40A mutant (Fig. 4G), suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation indeed antagonizes phosphorylation. Given that phosphorylation of Cdh1 antagonizes the interaction between Cdh1 and APC/C subunits (14Lukas C. Sørensen C.S. Kramer E. Santoni-Rugiu E. Lindeneg C. Peters J.M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Accumulation of cyclin B1 requires E2F and cyclin-A-dependent rearrangement of the anaphase-promoting complex.Nature. 1999; 401: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we reasoned that O-GlcNAcylation may also be involved. HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-Cdh1-WT, -S40A, -3A, or -4A plasmids, and then the interaction between an APC/C subunit, Cdc27, and Cdh1 was examined (Fig. 5A). Cdh1-S40A displayed stronger interaction with Cdc27, as Ser-40 is a known phosphorylation site. Interaction between Cdh1-4A and Cdc27 was even stronger, as the four phosphorylation sites were a"
https://openalex.org/W2342136823,"In Bangladesh, anthrax, caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, is considered an endemic disease affecting ruminants with sporadic zoonotic occurrences in humans. Due to the lack of knowledge about risks from an incorrect removal of infected carcasses, the disease is not properly monitored, and because of the socio-economic conditions, the situation is under-reported and under-diagnosed. For sensitive species, anthrax represents a fatal outcome with sudden death and sometimes bleeding from natural orifices. The most common source of infection for ruminants is ingestion of spores during grazing in contaminated pastures or through grass and water contaminated with anthrax spores. Domestic cattle, sheep and goats can also become infected through contaminated bone meal (used as feed) originating from anthrax-infected carcasses. The present investigation was conducted to isolate B. anthracis organisms from 169 samples (73 soil, 1 tissue, 4 bone and 91 bone meal samples) collected from 12 different districts of Bangladesh. The sampling was carried out from 2012 to 2015. Twelve samples resulted positive for B. anthracis. Biomolecular analyses were conducted starting from the Canonical Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (CanSNP) to analyze the phylogenetic origin of strains. The analysis of genotype, obtained through the Multiple Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) with the analysis of 15 Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTR), demonstrated four different genotypes: two of them were previously identified in the district of Sirajganj. The sub-genotyping, conducted with Single Nucleotide Repeats analysis, revealed the presence of eight subgenotypes. The data of the present study concluded that there was no observed correlation between imported cattle feed and anthrax occurrence in Bangladesh and that the remarkable genetic variations of B. anthracis were found in the soil of numerous outbreaks in this country."
https://openalex.org/W2342383856,"Nowadays, drug abuse and addiction are serious public health problems in the USA. Methamphetamine (METH) is one of the most abused drugs and is known to cause brain damage after repeated exposure. In this paper, we conducted a neuroproteomic study to evaluate METH-induced brain protein dynamics, following a two-week chronic regimen of an escalating dose of METH exposure. Proteins were extracted from rat brain hippocampal and olfactory bulb tissues and subjected to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Both shotgun and targeted proteomic analysis were performed. Protein quantification was initially based on comparing the spectral counts between METH exposed animals and their control counterparts. Quantitative differences were further confirmed through multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) LC-MS/MS experiments. According to the quantitative results, the expression of 18 proteins (11 in the hippocampus and 7 in the olfactory bulb) underwent a significant alteration as a result of exposing rats to METH. 13 of these proteins were up-regulated after METH exposure while 5 were down-regulated. The altered proteins belonging to different structural and functional families were involved in processes such as cell death, inflammation, oxidation, and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2339570278,"The main objectives of the current study was i) to prospectively examine if chronic musculoskeletal pain in parents is associated with risk of chronic musculoskeletal pain in their adult offspring, and ii) to assess if these parent-offspring associations are modified by offspring body mass index and leisure time physical activity. We used data on 4,742 adult offspring linked with their parents who participated in the population-based HUNT Study in Norway in 1995–97 and in 2006–08. Family relations were established through the national Family Registry. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). In total, 1,674 offspring (35.3%) developed chronic musculoskeletal pain during the follow-up period of approximately 11 years. Both maternal (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.55) and paternal chronic musculoskeletal pain (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.57) was associated with increased risk of offspring chronic musculoskeletal pain. Compared to offspring of parents without chronic musculoskeletal pain, the adverse effect of parental pain was somewhat stronger among offspring who reported a low (RR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.52) versus high (RR: 1.32, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.84) level of leisure time physical activity. Offspring of parents with chronic musculoskeletal pain and who were classified as obese had more than twofold increased risk (RR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.68, 3.24) of chronic musculoskeletal pain compared to normal weight offspring of parents without pain. In conclusion, parental chronic musculoskeletal pain is positively associated with risk of chronic musculoskeletal pain in their adult offspring. Maintenance of normal body weight may reduce the risk of chronic musculoskeletal pain in offspring of pain-afflicted parents."
https://openalex.org/W2340779665,"The way we talk can influence how we are perceived by others. Whereas previous studies have started to explore the influence of social goals on syntactic alignment, in the current study, we additionally investigated whether syntactic alignment effectively influences conversation partners’ perception of the speaker. To this end, we developed a novel paradigm in which we can measure the effect of social goals on the strength of syntactic alignment for one participant (primed participant), while simultaneously obtaining usable social opinions about them from their conversation partner (the evaluator). In Study 1, participants’ desire to be rated favorably by their partner was manipulated by assigning pairs to a Control (i.e., primed participants did not know they were being evaluated) or Evaluation context (i.e., primed participants knew they were being evaluated). Surprisingly, results showed no significant difference in the strength with which primed participants aligned their syntactic choices with their partners’ choices. In a follow-up study, we used a Directed Evaluation context (i.e., primed participants knew they were being evaluated and were explicitly instructed to make a positive impression). However, again, there was no evidence supporting the hypothesis that participants’ desire to impress their partner influences syntactic alignment. With respect to the influence of syntactic alignment on perceived likeability by the evaluator, a negative relationship was reported in Study 1: the more primed participants aligned their syntactic choices with their partner, the more that partner decreased their likeability rating after the experiment. However, this effect was not replicated in the Directed Evaluation context of Study 2. In other words, our results do not support the conclusion that speakers’ desire to be liked affects how much they align their syntactic choices with their partner, nor is there convincing evidence that there is a reliable relationship between syntactic alignment and perceived likeability."
https://openalex.org/W2341415698,"Hearing loss (HL) is one of the most common sensorineural disorders and several dozen genes contribute to its pathogenesis. Establishing a genetic diagnosis of HL is of great importance for clinical evaluation of deaf patients and for estimating recurrence risks for their families. Efforts to identify genes responsible for HL have been challenged by high genetic heterogeneity and different ethnic-specific prevalence of inherited deafness. Here we present the utility of whole exome sequencing (WES) for identifying candidate causal variants for previously unexplained nonsyndromic HL of seven patients from four unrelated Altaian families (the Altai Republic, South Siberia). The WES analysis revealed homozygous missense mutations in three genes associated with HL. Mutation c.2168A>G (SLC26A4) was found in one family, a novel mutation c.1111G>C (OTOF) was revealed in another family, and mutation c.5254G>A (RAI1) was found in two families. Sanger sequencing was applied for screening of identified variants in an ethnically diverse cohort of other patients with HL (n = 116) and in Altaian controls (n = 120). Identified variants were found only in patients of Altaian ethnicity (n = 93). Several lines of evidences support the association of homozygosity for discovered variants c.5254G>A (RAI1), c.1111C>G (OTOF), and c.2168A>G (SLC26A4) with HL in Altaian patients. Local prevalence of identified variants implies possible founder effect in significant number of HL cases in indigenous population of the Altai region. Notably, this is the first reported instance of patients with RAI1 missense mutation whose HL is not accompanied by specific traits typical for Smith-Magenis syndrome. Presumed association of RAI1 gene variant c.5254G>A with isolated HL needs to be proved by further experimental studies."
https://openalex.org/W2338236074,"Fibromyalgia, a chronic syndrome of diffuse musculoskeletal pain and somatic hyperalgesia from central sensitization, is very often comorbid with visceral pain conditions. In fibromyalgia patients with gallbladder calculosis, this study assessed the short and long-term impact of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on fibromyalgia pain symptoms. Fibromyalgia pain (VAS scale) and pain thresholds in tender points and control areas (skin, subcutis and muscle) were evaluated 1week before (basis) and 1week, 1,3,6 and 12months after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in fibromyalgia patients with symptomatic calculosis (n = 31) vs calculosis patients without fibromyalgia (n. 26) and at comparable time points in fibromyalgia patients not undergoing cholecystectomy, with symptomatic (n = 27) and asymptomatic (n = 28) calculosis, and no calculosis (n = 30). At basis, fibromyalgia+symptomatic calculosis patients presented a significant linear correlation between the number of previously experienced biliary colics and fibromyalgia pain (direct) and muscle thresholds (inverse)(p<0.0001). After cholecystectomy, fibromyalgia pain significantly increased and all thresholds significantly decreased at 1week and 1month (1-way ANOVA, p<0.01-p<0.001), the decrease in muscle thresholds correlating linearly with the peak postoperative pain at surgery site (p<0.003-p<0.0001). Fibromyalgia pain and thresholds returned to preoperative values at 3months, then pain significantly decreased and thresholds significantly increased at 6 and 12months (p<0.05-p<0.0001). Over the same 12-month period: in non-fibromyalgia patients undergoing cholecystectomy thresholds did not change; in all other fibromyalgia groups not undergoing cholecystectomy fibromyalgia pain and thresholds remained stable, except in fibromyalgia+symptomatic calculosis at 12months when pain significantly increased and muscle thresholds significantly decreased (p<0.05-p<0.0001). The results of the study show that biliary colics from gallbladder calculosis represent an exacerbating factor for fibromyalgia symptoms and that laparoscopic cholecystectomy produces only a transitory worsening of these symptoms, largely compensated by the long-term improvement/desensitization due to gallbladder removal. This study provides new insights into the role of visceral pain comorbidities and the effects of their treatment on fibromyalgia pain/hypersensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2336899488,"Birth synchrony is well documented among ungulates and is hypothesised to maximize neonate survival, either by minimizing the risk of predation through predator swamping or by synchronising birthing with increased seasonal food availability. We used encapsulated vaginal implant transmitters to locate and capture neonatal moose calves and document the seasonal and diel timing of parturition in two adjacent study areas with different predation pressure in central Ontario, Canada. We tested the hypothesis that predation promotes earlier and more synchronous birth of moose calves. Across both areas, proportionately more births occurred during the afternoon and fewer than expected occurred overnight. Mean date of calving averaged 1.5 days earlier and calving was also more synchronous in the study area with heavier predation pressure, despite average green-up date and peak Normalized Difference Vegetation Index date occurring 2 days later in this study area than in the area receiving lighter predation pressure. We encourage analysis of data on timing of parturition from additional study areas experiencing varying degrees of predation pressure to better clarify the influence of predation in driving seasonal and diel timing of parturition in temperate ungulates."
https://openalex.org/W2337846480,"In the Found or Fly (FoF) hypothesis ant queens experience reproduction-dispersal tradeoffs such that queens with heavier abdomens are better at founding colonies but are worse flyers. We tested predictions of FoF in two globally invasive fire ants, Solenopsis geminata (Fabricius, 1804) and S. invicta (Buren, 1972). Colonies of these species may produce two different monogyne queen types-claustral queens with heavy abdomens that found colonies independently, and parasitic queens with small abdomens that enter conspecific nests. Claustral and parasitic queens were similarly sized, but the abdomens of claustral queens weighed twice as much as those of their parasitic counterparts. Their heavier abdomens adversely impacted morphological predictors of flight ability, resulting in 32-38% lower flight muscle ratios, 55-63% higher wing loading, and 32-33% higher abdomen drag. In lab experiments maximum flight durations in claustral S. invicta queens decreased by about 18 minutes for every milligram of abdomen mass. Combining our results into a simple fitness tradeoff model, we calculated that an average parasitic S. invicta queen could produce only 1/3 as many worker offspring as a claustral queen, but could fly 4 times as long and have a 17- to 36-fold larger potential colonization area. Investigations of dispersal polymorphisms and their associated tradeoffs promises to shed light on range expansions in invasive species, the evolution of alternative reproductive strategies, and the selective forces driving the recurrent evolution of parasitism in ants."
https://openalex.org/W2342115322,"miRNAs are potent regulators of gene expression and modulate multiple cellular processes in physiology and pathology. Deregulation of miRNAs expression has been found in various cancer types, thus, miRNAs may be potential targets for cancer therapy. However, the mechanisms through which miRNAs are regulated in cancer remain unclear. Therefore, the identification of transcriptional factor-miRNA crosstalk is one of the most update aspects of the study of miRNAs regulation.In the present study we describe the development of a fast and user-friendly software, named infinity, able to find the presence of DNA matrices, such as binding sequences for transcriptional factors, on ~65kb (kilobase) of 939 human miRNA genomic sequences, simultaneously. Of note, the power of this software has been validated in vivo by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation assays on a subset of new in silico identified target sequences (CCAAT) for the transcription factor NF-Y on colon cancer deregulated miRNA loci. Moreover, for the first time, we have demonstrated that NF-Y, through its CCAAT binding activity, regulates the expression of miRNA-181a, -181b, -21, -17, -130b, -301b in colon cancer cells.The infinity software that we have developed is a powerful tool to underscore new TF/miRNA regulatory networks.Infinity was implemented in pure Java using Eclipse framework, and runs on Linux and MS Windows machine, with MySQL database.

https://openalex.org/W2342381850,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) may take decades to develop and early life exposures such as infection may be important. However, few epidemiological studies have evaluated early life risk factors in relation to PD risk. We therefore examined such associations in a prospective analysis of 3 545 612 individuals born in Sweden between 1932 and 1970 without PD on January 1, 2002. Incident PD cases were identified using the Swedish Patient Register during 2002–2010. Information on sibship size, number of older and younger siblings, multiple births, parental age, birth month and season was obtained from the Swedish Multi-Generation Register. Monthly data on national burden of influenza-like illness during 1932–1970 were obtained from the Swedish Public Health Agency. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. During the follow-up, 8779 incident PD cases were identified. As expected, older age, male sex, parental occupation as farmers, and family history of PD were associated with higher PD risk. Overall, early life factors, including flu burden in the year of birth, were not associated with PD risk, although we did find a lower PD risk among participants with older siblings than those without (HR = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.89, 0.98). Our study therefore provided little support for important etiological contributions of early life factors to the PD risk late in life. The finding of a lower PD risk among individuals with older siblings will need confirmation and further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2336084145,"Consistent with the limited dispersal capacity of most troglobitic animals, almost all Lucifuga cavefish species have very narrow geographic distribution in Cuba. However, one species, L. dentata, has a wide but disjointed distribution over 300 km in the west of the island. In order to estimate the relative role of vicariance and dispersal in the unexpected L. dentata distribution, we obtained partial sequences of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b (cytb) gene and control region (CR), and then applied Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), based on the identification of five genetic and geographic congruent groups of populations. The process that best explains the distribution of genetic diversity in this species is sequential range expansion from east Matanzas to the western Pinar del Río provinces, followed by isolation of groups of populations. We found relative high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity in all but the Havana group, which has high values for both diversity parameters, suggesting that this group has been demographically stable over time. For two groups of populations (Cayuco and Bolondrón), the mismatch distribution analyses suggests past demographic expansion. In the case of the Cayuco region, the star like relationships of haplotypes in the network suggests a recent founding event, congruent with other evidence indicating that this is the most recently colonized region. Over all, the results suggest that a combination of habitat availability, temporal interconnections, and possibly the biological properties of this species, may have enabled its dispersal and range expansion compared to other species of the genus, which are more geographically restricted."

Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor-a new class of antiviral therapy for influenza. Although its efficacy and safety have been established, there is uncertainty regarding whether influenza-like illness (ILI) in children is best managed by oseltamivir at the onset of illness, and its cost-effectiveness in children has not been studied in China.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of post rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) treatment with oseltamivir and empiric treatment with oseltamivir comparing with no antiviral therapy against influenza for children with ILI.We developed a decision-analytic model based on previously published evidence to simulate and evaluate 1-year potential clinical and economic outcomes associated with three managing strategies for children presenting with symptoms of influenza. Model inputs were derived from literature and expert opinion of clinical practice and research in China. Outcome measures included costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY). All the interventions were compared with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER).In base case analysis, empiric treatment with oseltamivir consistently produced the greatest gains in QALY. When compared with no antiviral therapy, the empiric treatment with oseltamivir strategy is very cost effective with an ICER of RMB 4,438. When compared with the post RIDT treatment with oseltamivir, the empiric treatment with oseltamivir strategy is dominant. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis projected that there is a 100% probability that empiric oseltamivir treatment would be considered as a very cost-effective strategy compared to the no antiviral therapy, according to the WHO recommendations for cost-effectiveness thresholds. The same was concluded with 99% probability for empiric oseltamivir treatment being a very cost-effective strategy compared to the post RIDT treatment with oseltamivir.In the Chinese setting of current health system, our modelling based simulation analysis suggests that empiric treatment with oseltamivir to be a cost-saving and very cost-effective strategy in managing children with ILI."
https://openalex.org/W2341865876,"Pseudopimelodidae are Neotropical catfishes characterized by having slightly to strongly depressed body in fully developed specimens. The largest species of the family with 500 mm SL, Lophiosilurus alexandri, experiences impressive changes in body shape during development, becoming extremely depressed when fully developed. Accordingly, Lophiosilurus alexandri is an ideal species to observe the morphological changes during ontogeny, and to seek solid interpretations on the polarity of characters. Specimens of distinct larval periods (yolk sac, flexion and postflexion; n = 186 specimens) and juvenile stages (n = 20) were analyzed. Changes in body shape, position of mouth and eye, morphology of fins and pigmentation were observed during the development of Lophiosilurus. Larvae (5.7-11.2 mm standard length) had pigmentation concentrated on the head and parts of body, eyes small and pigmented, short barbels, and well-developed finfold. Juveniles (15.9-28.1 mm standard length) had body shape similar to adult, with head depressed and bearing bony ridges, large mouth, dorsally-oriented eyes, small barbels and well-developed shoulder bulges (cleithral width). The greatest morphological changes in the development of L. alexandri occurred during the postflexion larval stage. Relative to standard length, measurements of snout length, head depth and body depth are smaller in juveniles than in larvae, but body width is larger. New interpretations on the phylogenetic characters related to these changes are provided in view of the two alternative hypotheses of the evolution of Pseudopimelodidae."
https://openalex.org/W2339640603,"Theoretically, the functional traits of native species should determine how natives respond to invader-driven changes. To explore this idea, we simulated a large-scale plant invasion using dead spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) stems to determine if native spiders' web-building behaviors could explain differences in spider population responses to structural changes arising from C. stoebe invasion. After two years, irregular web-spiders were >30 times more abundant and orb weavers were >23 times more abundant on simulated invasion plots compared to controls. Additionally, irregular web-spiders on simulated invasion plots built webs that were 4.4 times larger and 5.0 times more likely to capture prey, leading to >2-fold increases in recruitment. Orb-weavers showed no differences in web size or prey captures between treatments. Web-spider responses to simulated invasion mimicked patterns following natural invasions, confirming that C. stoebe's architecture is likely the primary attribute driving native spider responses to these invasions. Differences in spider responses were attributable to differences in web construction behaviors relative to historic web substrate constraints. Orb-weavers in this system constructed webs between multiple plants, so they were limited by the overall quantity of native substrates but not by the architecture of individual native plant species. Irregular web-spiders built their webs within individual plants and were greatly constrained by the diminutive architecture of native plant substrates, so they were limited both by quantity and quality of native substrates. Evaluating native species traits in the context of invader-driven change can explain invasion outcomes and help to identify factors limiting native populations."

The goal of the present study was to assess the functional impact of these drugs on thyroxin-induced hemodynamic changes, cardiac hypertrophy and associated altered responses of the contractile myocardium both in-vivo at the whole heart level and ex-vivo at the cardiac tissue level. Control and thyroxin (500 μg/kg/day)-treated mice with or without 2-week treatments of sorafenib (10 mg/kg/day; I.P), tadalafil (1 mg/kg/day; I.P or 4 mg/kg/day; oral), macitentan (30 and 100 mg/kg/day; oral), and their vehicles were studied. Blood pressure, echocardiography and electrocardiogram were non-invasively evaluated, followed by ex-vivo assessments of isolated multicellular cardiac preparations. Thyroxin increased blood pressure, resulted in cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction in-vivo. Also, it caused contractile abnormalities in right ventricular papillary muscles ex-vivo. None of the drug treatments were able to significantly attenuate theses hemodynamic changes or cardiac abnormalities in thyroxin-treated mice. We show here for the first time that multikinase (raf1/b, VEGFR, PDGFR), phosphodiesterase-5, and endothelin-1 pathways have no major role in thyroxin-induced hemodynamic changes and cardiac abnormalities. In particular, our data show that the involvement of endothelin-1 pathway in thyroxine-induced cardiac hypertrophy/dysfunction seems to be model-dependent and should be carefully interpreted."

I took on students based on grades and test scores, and my relationships with them were one-on-one. I didn't consider their teamwork abilities or soft skills—or the group dynamic as a whole. This approach gave me a somewhat productive lab group as measured by single member outputs, but over many years, I came to appreciate that the collective matters—a lot. Beyond the individual output of the graduate students and postdocs lies a parallel universe of teamwork, peer-to-peer mentoring, and—most important—discovery for the research group as a whole.

> “Using the powerful group as a way to think is like conducting an orchestra.” 

I found this quite by accident, 10 years into my faculty appointment, with the arrival of a European postdoc who insisted that the group have daily morning coffee like he had “back home.” This ritual evolved from nonacademic conversations over pastries to daily check-ins about what the group was working on to discussions of new ideas. Over the years, these conversations have been the most satisfying part of my job and have led to some of my group's better papers.

I now think of each group member as a critical puzzle piece for my collective. I assemble teams of individuals with different but complementary scientific backgrounds and play off of the (healthy) tension between them, where they question one another's approaches and perspectives. Research group members will have their own theses, projects, and papers, but one can orchestrate a group dynamic that promotes discussion about where the field should be headed and the best new questions to ask.

The first step toward creating this environment and fostering a powerful research group is building relationships. Regular social activities outside of work can help break down walls and create a team spirit. Weekly lab meetings, morning coffee, group lunches, or Friday after-work beers can engineer serendipity across the entire group, or smaller subgroups that head into new directions with curiosity-driven side projects. The team building also creates a sense of safety, trust, and belonging. In my lab, there are high expectations for unselfish cooperation and maintaining one another's reputations. We adhere to the old adage that if you do not have something nice to say about someone, then say nothing at all. Foibles are tolerated; disagreements are settled quickly.

Lab diversity, be it scientific or cultural, can make building community challenging, but that diversity itself can add immense power to the team. Certainly I have found that my most productive groups over the years have been the ones with the greatest gender balance and range of cultural and scientific backgrounds. A group leader can learn to leverage this diversity and draw out ideas from some who may be timid in group discussions. Something as simple as not letting anyone dominate during discussions can help. Inviting a gifted member to throw out an idea and having the group discuss it can also be effective.

Using the powerful group as a way to think is like conducting an orchestra. It involves assembling a varied group of musicians, each with solo skills, and helping them play together, creating a piece I could never accomplish myself or with a single student or postdoc.

I have in no way mastered the powerful research group, which is an evolving and ever-changing thing. New lab members bring in new opportunities and challenges. But one thing I now understand is that as old members fledge, the powerful group extends well beyond the faculty member's home institution. The group becomes a ready-made network for collaboration among lab alumni who go on to develop their own orchestras, repeating the cycle of the powerful research group elsewhere.
