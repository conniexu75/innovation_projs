Transcriptional dysregulation and loss of function of transcriptional co-activator proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Huntington's disease is caused by expansion of a repeated sequence of the amino acid glutamine in the abnormal protein huntingtin (Htt). Here we show that the polyglutamine-containing domain of Htt, Htt exon 1 protein (Httex1p), directly binds the acetyltransferase domains of two distinct proteins: CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF). In cell-free assays, Httex1p also inhibits the acetyltransferase activity of at least three enzymes: p300, P/CAF and CBP. Expression of Httex1p in cultured cells reduces the level of the acetylated histones H3 and H4, and this reduction can be reversed by administering inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC). In vivo, HDAC inhibitors arrest ongoing progressive neuronal degeneration induced by polyglutamine repeat expansion, and they reduce lethality in two Drosophila models of polyglutamine disease. These findings raise the possibility that therapy with HDAC inhibitors may slow or prevent the progressive neurodegeneration seen in Huntington's disease and other polyglutamine-repeat diseases, even after the onset of symptoms."

The mature serine protease Omi (also known as HtrA2) was identified as a mitochondrial direct BIR3-binding protein and a caspase activator. Like mature Smac (also known as Diablo), mature Omi contains a conserved IAP-binding motif (AVPS) at its N terminus, which is exposed after processing of its N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence upon import into the mitochondria. Mature Omi is released together with mature Smac from the mitochondria into the cytosol upon disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane during apoptosis. Finally, mature Omi can induce apoptosis in human cells in a caspase-independent manner through its protease activity and in a caspase-dependent manner via its ability to disrupt caspase-IAP interaction. Our results provide clear evidence for the involvement of a mitochondrial serine protease in the apoptotic pathway, emphasizing the critical role of the mitochondria in cell death.

All IAPs share one or more signature motifs, referred to as BIRs, that are essential for the antiapoptotic activity associated with these proteins. The BIR motifs have been shown to bind directly to caspases and to inhibit their activity (2Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C.

In the insect Drosophila melanogaster, three proteins known as Reaper, Hid, and Grim have been identified as direct IAP-binding proteins that promote caspase activation by binding to the BIR domain of IAPs and disrupting IAP-caspase interaction (5Abrams J.M.

Although Smac/Diablo does not share sequence homology with these proteins except for the first four N-terminal residues, which constitute its IAP-binding motif (8Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J.W.

Smac promotes caspase activation and apoptosis by binding to the BIR3 and BIR2 domains of XIAP and disrupting its interaction with caspase-9 and the effector caspases (caspase-3 and -7) (8Wu G.

Since the mechanism of IAP inhibition of caspases is conserved in mammals and insects, it is expected that other mammalian IAP-binding proteins are still undiscovered. In this report, we identified the serine protease Omi/HtrA2 as a mitochondrial direct IAP-binding protein, which is released from the mitochondria upon induction of apoptosis by apoptotic stimuli. Like Smac, the mature Omi protein contains a conserved IAP-binding motif (AVPS) at its N terminus. We demonstrate that deregulated expression of Omi in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells induces apoptosis in these cells, indicating that Omi could participate in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo identify novel IAP binding proteins, we used a GST-BIR3 fusion protein as an affinity reagent to purify new IAP-binding proteins from extracts of human 293 cells and mouse tissues. After binding the extracts to the GST-BIR3 protein, the bound proteins were eluted with the IAP-binding motif peptide AVPIA and analyzed by Far Western blotting with 35S-labeled XIAP. Three proteins, migrating as 23-, 38-, and 80-kDa bands, that specifically interact with the35S-labeled XIAP, were detected in the AVPIA peptide eluates from the human 293 cells and the mouse tissues (Fig.1a). A large scale affinity preparation was then fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig.1b), and the three bands were cut and subjected to microsequencing. Due to the low level of the 80-kDa protein in this preparation, limited N-terminal sequence information was obtained, which was not sufficient for protein identification. The N-terminal sequence information of the other two proteins revealed that the 23-kDa protein is mature Smac/Diablo (13Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2891) Google Scholar, 14Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar), whereas the 38-kDa band is a previously described serine protease named Omi or HtrA2 (15Faccio L. Fusco C.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 5699-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number XM_002750). Mass spectrometric peptide mass fingerprinting of these two protein bands confirmed the microsequencing results. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of the AVPIA peptide eluates using Smac and Omi antibodies confirmed that the 23-kDa band represents Smac and the 38-kDa band represents Omi (Fig. 1,a and c).To confirm that Omi associates directly with the BIR3 domain of XIAP but not with the Smac protein, we depleted Smac from the 293 extracts with a Smac monoclonal antibody, bound the depleted extracts to the GST-BIR3 protein, and then analyzed the bound proteins by Far Western with 35S-XIAP and Western blotting with the Smac antibody. Depletion of Smac did not remove Omi from the 293 extracts, indicating that Omi binds independently to the GST-BIR3 protein (Fig.1d). Moreover, Omi, Smac, and the 80-kDa protein did not bind to the GST-BIR3-E314S mutant (Fig. 1d, last lanes). This mutation has been shown to abolish binding of Smac and caspase-9 to BIR3 (8Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J.W. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 9Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A.

These results indicate that Omi, Smac, and the 80-kDa protein associate directly with the Smac binding pocket on the BIR3 of XIAP.The BIR3 affinity-purified Omi starts with an amino-terminal AVPS sequence, which represents a conserved IAP-binding motif (Fig.2A). Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned Omi protein (15Faccio L. Fusco C. Chen A. Martinotti S. Bonventre J.V. Zervos A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2581-2588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 16Gray C.W. Ward R.V. Karran E. Turconi S. Rowles A. Viglienghi D. Southan C. Barton A. Fantom K.G.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 5699-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), this motif is located at residue 134, suggesting that Omi is made as a precursor protein that undergoes proteolytic processing at residue 133 to remove the N-terminal leader sequence. To determine whether a recombinant Omi lacking the first 133 residues (mature Omi) can interact with the GST-BIR3 fusion protein, we expressed this protein with a C-terminal His6 tag in bacteria and purified it to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 2b, right panel). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the recombinant proteins indicated that the initiator methionine is removed. Both recombinant mature Omi and Smac were able to interact equally with the wild type GST-BIR3 protein but not with the GST-BIR3-E314S mutant (Fig. 2b,left panel). Mature Omi and Smac were also able to interact with the GST-BIR1,2 fusion protein. Mutation of the active site Ser306 to Ala of mature Omi did not affect its interaction with GST-BIR3. However, deletion of the AVPS motif of mature Omi completely abolished its interaction with the GST-BIR3 fusion protein. Mature Omi can also interact with endogenous XIAP in transfected 293 cells (Fig. 2d, upper panel) and requires the AVPS motif, since mutation of this motif to AAAS abolished its interaction with the endogenous XIAP. Interestingly, mutation of the AVPS motif to AAAS did not affect the processing and removal of the N-terminal leader sequence of the transfected Omi precursor but completely prevented the interaction with endogenous XIAP (Fig. 2d, middle panel). In vitro interaction assays revealed that mature Omi could also interact with cIAP1 and cIAP2 (Fig.2c). The above data indicate that Omi is a bona fide IAP-binding protein with an N-terminal IAP binding motif essential for its ability to bind IAPs.Figure 2The N terminus of mature Omi harbors an IAP-binding motif.a, bar diagramrepresenting the structure of the Omi precursor and the location of the AVPS motif.

This sequence might be removed by mitochondrial processing peptidases upon import into the mitochondria. To examine whether the endogenous mature Omi protein is indeed localized in the mitochondria, we subfractionated 293 cells into cytosolic, mitochondrial, microsomal, and nuclear fractions and bound each fraction to the GST-BIR3 protein. As shown in Fig.3a, Far Western and Western blot analyses with 35S-XIAP and Smac and Omi antibodies, respectively, showed the majority of Omi and Smac to be localized in the mitochondrial fraction. Next we subfractionated purified mitochondria from HEK293 cells into intermembrane space and matrix fractions using 1–1.2% digitonin, which specifically disrupts the outer mitochondrial membrane without affecting the inner mitochondrial membrane. The fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with Omi and Smac antibodies. Both Omi and Smac were predominantly present in the intermembrane space fraction (Fig. 3b).Figure 3Omi is localized in the mitochondria.a, 293T cells were fractionated into nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and cytosolic fractions. The nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions were lysed in a hypotonic buffer, and the soluble proteins bound to GST-BIR3 fusion protein and were analyzed as in the legend to Fig. 1a. The same Far Western blot (upper panel) was then probed with Omi and Smac antibodies (second and third panels, respectively). Total subcellular fractions were also immunoblotted with antibodies against cytochrome c oxidase (fourth panel), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (fifth panel), and β-actin (sixth panel).b, purified mitochondria from 293 cells were treated with a buffer containing 1.2% digitonin, and the supernatant and mitoplasts (pellet) were then analyzed by Western blotting with Omi, Smac, and cytochrome c oxidase antibodies. c, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of MCF-7 cells stained with Omi-specific (middle panel, green) and Smac-specific (left panel, red) antibodies. d, confocal micrographs of MCF-7 cells transfected with GFP (left panel) or C-terminal GFP-tagged mature Omi (Omi134–458-GFP; middle panel) or Omi precursor (Omi-GFP; right panel). e, confocal micrographs of MCF-7 cells transfected with C-terminal RFP-tagged Omi1–60 (Omi-MTS-RFP;left panel) and pEYFP-Mito marker (middle panel).

To confirm the mitochondrial localization of Omi, we transfected MCF-7 cells with a C-terminal GFP-tagged Omi precursor construct. The ectopically transfected Omi precursor exhibited punctate mitochondrial fluorescence (Fig. 3d, right panel). The removal of the mitochondrial targeting sequence of Omi resulted in the expression of mature Omi (residues 134–458) in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3d, middle panel). The first 60 residues of the Omi precursor, which harbors the MTS, was sufficient for targeting RFP to the mitochondria when expressed as a fusion protein with RFP (Fig. 3e). Taken together, the above data indicate that Omi colocalizes with Smac in the intermitochondrial membrane space.To determine whether Omi is released together with Smac and cytochromec from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm during apoptosis, we treated Jurkat and HL-60 cells with staurosporine, which is known to induce the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and analyzed their cytosolic extracts by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig.4a, cytochrome c, Smac, and Omi accumulated in the cytosol of these cells in a time-dependent manner after treatment with staurosporine. Processing of procaspase-3 also followed a similar time course, with maximum processing observed at 6–8 h after treatment. Very little or no Omi or Smac proteins nor processing of procaspase-3 was detected in the extracts at zero time points. Similar results were obtained after treatment of Jurkat cells with TRAIL (Fig. 4b). Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of staurosporine-treated HeLa cells or TRAIL-treated MCF-7 cells showed diffused Immunofluorescence staining of Omi, whereas in the untreated control cells it is mostly punctate and perinuclear (Fig. 4c). The above data clearly show that Omi is released together with cytochrome c and Smac during apoptosis.The ability of TRAIL to induce release of Omi from the mitochondria of MCF-7 and Jurkat cells suggests that tBid, which is generated by active caspase-8 after TRAIL-receptor ligation, is responsible for the release of Omi. To test this hypothesis, we incubated isolated mitochondria with a physiological amount of tBid. As shown in Fig. 4d, tBid induced release of Omi, Smac, and cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the supernatants. Combined, the above data clearly show that Omi is released from the mitochondria together with cytochrome c and Smac during apoptosis and after stimulation of mitochondria with tBid.Next, we determined whether Omi, like Smac, promotes caspase-9 activity in HEK293 S100 extracts in the presence of XIAP. To measure the caspase-9 activity in these extracts, we added 35S-labeled procaspase-3 to the S100 extracts and stimulated the extracts with cytochrome c and dATP. As shown in Fig.5a, mature WT Omi or the S306A mutant was able to promote procaspase-3 activation in the XIAP-containing S100 extracts almost to the same extent as Smac. The ability to potentiate procaspase-3 activation was dependent on the AVPS motif of Omi, since deletion of this motif abolished its caspase-promoting activity. These observations suggest that Omi, like Smac, is able to disrupt the interaction of caspase-9 with XIAP in the S100 extracts to promote procaspase-3 activation.Figure 5Omi can potentiate caspase activation and apoptosis.a, 293T S100 extracts (20 μg) were mixed with purified XIAP (50 ng) and then stimulated with cytochromec (0.5 μg) plus dATP (1 mm) in the presence of increasing amounts (10, 50, and 300 ng, respectively) of purified mature WT Omi, Omi-ΔAVPS, Omi-S306A, or mature Smac in a 10-μl reaction volume. S100 extracts without XIAP (−) were used as controls. The reactions were carried out in the presence of35S-labeled procaspase-3 for 1 h and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.Fifth lane, S100 extracts incubated with 300 ng of WT Omi without XIAP. b, HeLa cells were transfected with an empty vector or constructs encoding a C-terminally FLAG-tagged wild type- or S306A Omi precursor together with pEGFP-N1 plasmid (CLONTECH) at a 4:1 ratio. The AVPS motif in the S306A mutant Omi precursor is also mutated to the VVAS sequence to prevent binding to IAPs. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with the indicated doses of staurosporine for 5 h, and the percentages of GFP-positive apoptotic cells were determined.Inset, expression of mature Omi wild type and Omi S306A mutant in the transfected cells as determined by immunoblotting with FLAG antibody. c, MCF-7 and HeLa cells were transfected with a full-length antisense Omi cDNA (+) in a pRSC-GFP double expression vector or an empty pRSC-GFP vector (−). 72 h after transfection, the cells were treated with Fas (500 ng/ml, 5 h), TRAIL (1 μg/ml, 5 h), or staurosporine (1 μm, 5 h) as indicated, and the percentages of GFP-positive apoptotic cells were determined by fluorescent microscopy after staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and propidium iodide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether release of Omi can potentiate apoptosis, we transfected human HeLa cells with the Omi precursor and stimulated the cells with different doses of staurosporine. We reasoned that treatment with staurosporine should release the overexpressed Omi from the mitochondria, thereby enhancing apoptosis. As shown in Fig.5b, transiently expressed wild type Omi did not induce significant apoptosis in the absence of staurosporine. However, at 500 nm staurosporine, ∼43% of the Omi-transfected cells showed signs of apoptosis compared with ∼20% in the case of the vector-transfected cells. With higher concentrations of staurosporine, increased apoptosis was observed in the Omi-transfected cells compared with the vector-transfected cells. No apoptosis potentiation was observed with an active site Omi precursor mutant, which also has a mutant VVAS sequence instead of the AVPS motif. These observations suggest that release of Omi by an apoptotic stimulus such as staurosporine enhances cell death.To determine whether endogenous Omi plays a role in cell death, we transfected MCF-7 and HeLa cells with an antisense Omi cDNA to reduce the expression of Omi in the transfected cells. As shown in Fig.5c, the Omi antisense cDNA reduced significantly (30–35%) the sensitivity of the transfected cells to apoptotic stimuli. These results suggest that Omi participates together with other apoptotic factors in the overall sensitivity of cells to apoptosis.Since Omi possesses both serine protease and IAP binding activities, we wanted to determine the contribution of each of these activities separately toward its overall proapoptotic activity. To determine the contribution of the serine protease activity of Omi toward its proapoptotic activity, it was necessary to express cytosolic protease-active and -inactive forms of Omi that do not bind IAPs in cells. This was achieved by expressing active and inactive (S306A) Omi-GFP fusion proteins without the MTS (M-Omi-GFP and M-Omi-S/A-GFP, respectively) in MCF-7 cells (Fig.6a). We found that these forms of Omi do not bind XIAP-BIR3 (Fig. 6e, first lane) because the initiator methionine before the AVPS motif is not removed in transfected human cells (not shown). Nevertheless, only the serine protease-active M-Omi-GFP, but not the inactive M-Omi-S/A-GFP, was able to induce cell death in MCF-7 cells (Fig.6b). Similar results were obtained with cytosolic Omi variants lacking the AVPS motif (data not shown). Of note, the Omi-killing activity was independent of the cellular caspase activity, since inhibition of cellular caspases with zVAD-FMK, XIAP, XIAP-BIR3, or caspase-9-DN did not block the ability of M-Omi-GFP to kill these cells. Consistent with these results, M-Omi-GFP was also able to induce cell death in Apaf −/− and caspase-9 −/− mouse embryo fibroblasts (Fig. 6c). These results indicate that Omi can induce cell death in mammalian cells independent of caspases, Apaf-1, or IAPs via its serine protease activity.We next tested the contribution of the IAP binding activity of Omi to its killing activity. To do that, we replaced the MTS of Omi with a GFP-IETD sequence and mutated its active site Ser306 to Ala (Fig. 6a, GFP-IETD-AVP). Of note, the presence of the IETD sequence between GFP and Omi-S/A allowed caspase-dependent cleavage at the IETD site after the Asp residue and release of mature Omi-S/A in the cytosol of the transfected 293 and MCF-7 cells (Fig.6d). This mature Omi-S/A was able to bind the GST-BIR3 fusion protein (Fig. 6e), indicating that it is correctly processed to expose its AVPS motif. Consistent with this result, very little or no processing at the IETD site was observed in the cytosolic extracts of these cells in the presence of the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK (Fig. 6d). As shown in Fig. 6f, expression of the GFP-IETD-AVP fusion protein in MCF-7 cells enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in these cells severalfold above the GFP-transfected control cells. This activity was dependent on the AVPS motif, since mutation of the AVPS motif to an SSAS motif (GFP-IETD-SSA) abolished the apoptotic enhancement activity of Omi-S/A and the ability to bind to BIR3. These results indicate that the IAP binding activity of Omi represented by its AVPS motif plays a significant role in its ability to potentiate apoptosis independent of its protease activity. Taken together, Omi not only can induce cell death through its serine protease activity but also via its ability to bind and neutralize IAPs.Our observations reveal a new level of regulation of apoptosis by the mitochondria. The identification of Omi as a mitochondrial serine protease that can also bind and neutralize IAPs adds to the list of proapoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor, Smac, and endonuclease G (18Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar, 19Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Li L.Y. Luo X.

Nature. 2001; 412: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), which are released from the mitochondria during apoptosis, and emphasizes the importance of the mitochondria in the cell death pathway of eukaryotic cells. Because Omi is a serine protease, its sequestration in the mitochondria protects healthy cells from its proteolytic activity. However, when cells become damaged, they release Omi, together with other intermitochondrial membrane space proteins, into the cytoplasm, where it could cause irreparable proteolytic damage to important structural and regulatory components of the cell. In addition, mature Omi could play a role as an IAP inhibitor in the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway by binding to the BIR3 domain of XIAP and disrupting its interaction with the activated caspase-9. This activity may complement the activity of Smac by neutralizing more IAPs in the cytoplasm, resulting in more caspase activation in cells undergoing apoptosis.While the importance of caspases in cell death is well established, a large body of evidence suggests that other types of proteases might also be important (22Solary E.

For example, inhibitors of serine proteases such as diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, andl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone can delay or fully inhibit distinct steps of the cell death pathway (22Solary E.

Thus, the serine protease activity of Omi could be responsible for the noncaspase-dependent cell death observed in many model systems.Although there is now clear evidence that cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor, and endonuclease G contribute to the demise of the cell when released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm or nucleus, the real physiological function of these proteins is far from being killer proteins. In fact, these proteins are essential for normal mitochondrial function and cell survival. This is most likely true for Omi. Omi b"

https://openalex.org/W2098254896,"The formation of small crystallites is governed by two competing factors: the free energy gained upon transferring constituent atoms, molecules or colloidal particles from the metastable liquid to the more stable solid, and the free energy needed to create the surface area of the crystallite. Because the ratio of surface area to bulk is large for small particles, small crystallites dissolve spontaneously under conditions where larger crystallites are stable and macroscopic crystal growth occurs only if spontaneously formed crystallites exceed a critical minimum size. On theoretical grounds, the probability of forming such critical crystal nuclei is expected to increase rapidly with supersaturation. However, experiments show that the rate of crystal nucleation in many systems goes through a maximum as the supersaturation is increased. It is commonly assumed that the nucleation rate peaks because, even though the probability of forming critical nuclei increases with increasing concentration, the rate of growth of such nuclei decreases. Here we report simulations of crystal nucleation in suspensions of colloidal spheres with varying size distributions that show that the probability that critical nuclei will form itself goes through a maximum as the supersaturation is increased. We find that this effect, which is strongest for systems with the broadest particle size distribution, results from an increase with supersaturation of the solid-liquid interfacial free energy. The magnitude of this effect suggests that vitrification at high supersaturations should yield colloidal glasses that are truly amorphous, rather than nano-crystalline."
https://openalex.org/W2045059538,"It is generally believed that mechanical signals must be large in order to be anabolic to bone tissue. Recent evidence indicates, however, that extremely low-magnitude (<10 microstrain) mechanical signals readily stimulate bone formation if induced at a high frequency. We examined the ability of extremely low-magnitude, high-frequency mechanical signals to restore anabolic bone cell activity inhibited by disuse. Adult female rats were randomly assigned to six groups: baseline control, age-matched control, mechanically stimulated for 10 min/day, disuse (hind limb suspension), disuse interrupted by 10 min/day of weight bearing, and disuse interrupted by 10 min/day of mechanical stimulation. After a 28 day protocol, bone formation rates (BFR) in the proximal tibia of mechanically stimulated rats increased compared with age-matched control (+97%). Disuse alone reduced BFR (-92%), a suppression only slightly curbed when disuse was interrupted by 10 min of weight bearing (-61%). In contrast, disuse interrupted by 10 min per day of low-level mechanical intervention normalized BFR to values seen in age-matched controls. This work indicates that this noninvasive, extremely low-level stimulus may provide an effective biomechanical intervention for the bone loss that plagues long-term space flight, bed rest, or immobilization caused by paralysis."

https://openalex.org/W2060715078,"Angiogenesis is an ordered process requiring the inter-play of numerous cellular and humoral factors. Studies over the past 20 years have identified several growth factors, cytokines, and enzymes that promote blood vessel formation. Most have revealed how individual factors promote an angiogenic phenotype in endothelial cells in vitro or contribute to blood vessel formation in vivo. However, the fundamental question that remains unanswered is how the cellular microenvironment contributes to angiogenesis. Fibrocytes are a recently characterized mesenchymal cell type isolated from peripheral blood that rapidly enter subcutaneously implanted wound chambers and sites of tissue injury. Here we describe the induction of an angiogenic phenotype in microvascular endothelial cells in vitro and promotion of angiogenesis in vivo by cultured fibrocytes. Fibrocytes constitutively secrete extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, primarily matrix metalloproteinase 9, which promotes endothelial cell invasion. In addition, fibrocytes secrete several proangiogenic factors including VEGF, bFGF, IL-8, PDGF, and hematopoietic growth factors that promote endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and/or tube formation. By contrast, they do not produce representative antiangiogenic factors. Finally, both autologous fibrocytes and fibrocyte-conditioned media were found to induce blood vessel formation in vivo using the Matrigel angiogenesis model."

Oxygen isotope records from deep-sea sediment cores suggest that during this time fluctuations in global temperatures and high-latitude continental ice volumes were influenced by orbital cycles. But it has hitherto not been possible to calibrate the inferred changes in ice volume with direct evidence for oscillations of the Antarctic ice sheets. Here we present sediment data from shallow marine cores in the western Ross Sea that exhibit well dated cyclic variations, and which link the extent of the East Antarctic ice sheet directly to orbital cycles during the Oligocene/Miocene transition (24.1-23.7 Myr ago). Three rapidly deposited glacimarine sequences are constrained to a period of less than 450 kyr by our age model, suggesting that orbital influences at the frequencies of obliquity (40 kyr) and eccentricity (125 kyr) controlled the oscillations of the ice margin at that time. An erosional hiatus covering 250 kyr provides direct evidence for a major episode of global cooling and ice-sheet expansion about 23.7 Myr ago, which had previously been inferred from oxygen isotope data (Mi1 event)."

https://openalex.org/W2104852357,"During postnatal development, the hair follicle (HF) shows cyclic activity with periods of relative resting, active growth (anagen), and regression. We demonstrate that similar to the HF induction in embryonic skin, initiation of a new hair growth phase in postnatal skin requires neutralization of the inhibitory activity of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) by the BMP antagonist noggin. In the resting HF, BMP4 mRNA predominates over noggin in the epithelium and mesenchyme, and the BMP receptor IA is prominently expressed in the follicular germ. Anagen development is accompanied by down-regulation of the BMP4 and increased noggin mRNA in the HF. Furthermore, administration of noggin protein induces new hair growth phase in postnatal telogen skin in vivo. In contrast, BMP4 induces selective arrest of anagen development in the non-tylotrich (secondary) HF. As a hair growth inducer, noggin increases Shh mRNA in the HF whereas BMP4 down-regulates Shh. This suggests that modulation of BMP4 signaling by noggin is essential for hair growth phase induction in postnatal skin and that the hair growth-inducing effect of noggin is mediated, at least in part, by Shh."
https://openalex.org/W2084983662,"We investigated the hypothesis that the antiatherosclerotic effect of 17beta-estradiol (E2) is due to a shift in the nitric oxide (NO)/superoxide (O2-) balance in the vessel wall, thereby increasing the bioavailability of NO. In human umbilical vein cultured endothelial cells, E2 (1-100 nmol/l), but not 17alpha-estradiol, caused a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in expression of the NADPH oxidase subunit gp91phox (up to 60% inhibition at both the mRNA and protein level). This effect was prevented by coincubation with the estrogen receptor antagonists tamoxifen and ICI 182,780 (1 micromol/l each). Within the same concentration range, E2 also up-regulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression ( approximately twofold). Moreover, preincubation of the cells with E2 or a gp91phox antisense oligonucleotide significantly decreased their capacity to generate O2- on phorbol ester stimulation (i.e., assembly of the active NADPH oxidase complex). Blockade of NO synthase activity, on the other hand, had no effect on phorbol ester-stimulated O2- formation. In addition, E2 (100 nmol/l) inhibited the increase in adhesion molecule and chemokine expression in cells exposed to cyclic strain. Cyclic strain enhanced endothelial O2- formation, thereby offsetting the inhibitory effect of NO on the expression of these gene products. E2 thus seems to act as an antioxidant at the genomic level which by improving the NO/O2- balance normalizes expression of proatherosclerotic gene products in endothelial cells."

In the present study, we provide the first evidence that relaxin (RLX), known as a pregnancy hormone, represents a potential compensatory mediator in human heart failure: plasma concentrations of RLX and myocardial expression of the two RLX genes (H1 and H2) correlate with the severity of disease and RLX responds to therapy. The failing human heart is a relevant source of circulating RLX peptides, and myocytes as well as interstitial cells produce RLX. Elevation of ventricular filling pressure up-regulates RLX expression and the hormone acts as a potent inhibitor of endothelin 1, the most powerful vasoconstrictor in heart failure. Furthermore, RLX modulates effects of angiotensin II, another crucial mediator. Our data identify RLX as a new player in human heart failure with potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance."

https://openalex.org/W2130452373,"Birds on migration alternate between consuming fuel stores during flights and accumulating fuel stores during stopovers. The optimal timing and length of flights and stopovers for successful migration depend heavily on the extra metabolic power input (fuel use) required to carry the fuel stores during flight. The effect of large fuel loads on metabolic power input has never been empirically determined. We measured the total metabolic power input of a long-distance migrant, the red knot (Calidris canutus), flying for 6 to 10 h in a wind tunnel, using the doubly labelled water technique. Here we show that total metabolic power input increased with fuel load, but proportionally less than the predicted mechanical power output from the flight muscles. The most likely explanation is that the efficiency with which metabolic power input is converted into mechanical output by the flight muscles increases with fuel load. This will influence current models of bird flight and bird migration. It may also help to explain why some shorebirds, despite the high metabolic power input required to fly, routinely make nonstop flights of 4,000 km longer."

https://openalex.org/W2077174989,"Various types of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) are associated with reduced pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes that results from mutations in genes involved in melanin synthesis. Immortal mouse melanocyte lines (melan-a, melan-b, and melan-c) provide opportune models with which to investigate the etiology of two different types of OCA (types I and III), which arise from mutations in Tyr and Tyrp1, respectively. We compared intracellular processing, sorting, and degradation of tyrosinase and Tyrp1, and the effects on their catalytic function and melanin synthesis, in these wild-type and mutant melanocytes. A mutation in either Tyr or Tyrp1 increased the time of association of tyrosinase and Tyrp1 with calnexin and Bip, which in turn resulted in the retention of these mutant products in the ER. A mutation in either gene selectively enhanced the duration and efficiency of chaperone interactions (even with the wild-type protein in the mutant melanocytes) and markedly slowed their transport to melanosomes. These results show that OCA1 and OCA3 are (in some cases, at least) ER retention diseases wherein a mutation in one melanogenic protein affects the maturation and stability of the other in the melanogenic pathway."

We tested whether ET-1[1-32] could affect the adhesion of human neutrophils to coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). ET-1[1-32] rapidly down-regulated the expression of L-selectin and up-regulated expression of CD11b/CD18 on the neutrophil surface, with EC50 values of 1-3 nM. These actions of ET-1[1-32] were mediated via ETA receptors and did not require conversion of ET-1[1-32] into ET-1 by neutrophil proteases, as revealed by liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Moreover, ET-1[1-32] evoked release of neutrophil gelatinase B, which cleaved big ET-1 to yield ET-1[1-32], thus revealing a positive feedback loop for ET-1[1-32] generation. Up-regulation of CD11b/CD18 expression and gelatinase release was tightly associated with activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). Stimulation of Erk activity was due to activation of Ras, Raf-1, and MEK (MAPK kinase). ET-1[1-32] also produced slight increases in the expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin on HCAEC, and markedly enhanced beta2 integrin-dependent adhesion of neutrophils to activated HCAEC. These results are the first indication that gelatinolytic MMPs via cleavage of big ET-1 to yield ET-1[1-32] activate neutrophils and promote leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and, consequently, neutrophil trafficking into inflamed tissues."

We examined the 1) amino acid region of ANXA1 that retained the protective effect in a model of rat heart IR; 2) changes in endogenous ANXA1 in relation to the IR induced damage and after pharmacological modulation; and 3) potential involvement of the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) in the protective action displayed by ANXA1 peptides. Administration of peptide Ac2-26 at 0, 30, and 60 min postreperfusion produced a significant protection against IR injury, and this was associated with reduced myeloperoxidase activity and IL-1beta levels in the infarcted heart. Western blotting and electron microscopy analyses showed that IR heart had increased ANXA1 expression in the injured tissue, associated mainly with the infiltrated leukocytes. Finally, an antagonist to the FPR receptor selectively inhibited the protective action of peptide ANXA1 and its derived peptides against IR injury. Altogether, these data provide further insight into the protective effect of ANXA1 and its mimetics and a rationale for a clinical use for drugs developed from this line of research."
https://openalex.org/W2036797279,"Enzymes secreted onto epithelial surfaces play a vital role in innate mucosal defense, but are believed to be steadily removed from the surface by mechanical actions. Thus, the amount and availability of enzymes on the surface are thought to be maintained by secretion. In contrast to this paradigm, we show here that enzymes are retained at the apical surface of the airway epithelium by binding to surface-associated hyaluronan, providing an apical enzyme pool 'ready for use' and protected from ciliary clearance. We have studied lactoperoxidase, which prevents bacterial colonization of the airway, and kallikrein, which mediates allergic bronchoconstriction that limits the inhalation of noxious substances. Binding to hyaluronan inhibits kallikrein, which is needed only in certain situations, whereas lactoperoxidase, useful at all times, does not change its activity. Hyaluronan itself interacts withthe receptor for hyaluronic acid-mediated motility (RHAMM or CD168) that is expressed at the apex of ciliated airway epithelial cells. Functionally, hyaluronan binding to RHAMM stimulates ciliary beating. Thus, hyaluronan plays a previously unrecognized pivotal role in mucosal host defense by stimulating ciliary clearance of foreign material while simultaneously retaining enzymes important for homeostasis at the apical surface so that they cannot be removed by ciliary action."

By using purified US6 and human TAP co-reconstituted in proteoliposomes, we demonstrate that the isolated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-luminal domain of US6 is essential and sufficient to block TAP-dependent peptide transport. Neither the overall amount of bound peptides nor the peptide affinity of TAP is affected by US6. Interestingly, US6 causes a specific arrest of the peptide-stimulated ATPase activity of TAP by preventing binding of ATP but not ADP. The affinity of the US6-TAP interaction was determined to 1 μm. The ER-luminal domain of US6 is monomeric in solution and consists of 19% α-helices, 25% β-sheets, and 27% β-turns. All eight cysteine residues are involved in forming a stabilizing network of four intramolecular disulfide bridges. Glycosylation of US6 is not required for function. These findings point to fascinating mechanistic and structural properties, by which specific binding of US6 at the ER-luminal loops of TAP signals across the membrane to the nucleotide-binding domains to prevent ATP hydrolysis of TAP.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although entirely unrelated, ICP47, an immediate early gene product of herpes simplex virus, focuses on the same target to shut down antigen processing (18Früh K. Ahn K. Djaballah H. Sempé P. van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. Nature. 1995; 375: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 19Hill A. Jugovic P. York I. Russ G. Bennink J. Yewdell J. Ploegh H. Johnson D. Nature. 1995; 375: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to US6, ICP47 blocks a very early step in the translocation cycle, which is peptide binding to TAP (20Ahn K. Meyer T.H. Uebel S. Sempé P. Djaballah H. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Früh K. Tampé R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3247-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 21Tomazin R. Hill A.B. Jugovic P. York I. van Endert P. Ploegh H.L. Andrews D.W. Johnson D.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3256-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As a consequence, ICP47 inhibits the cross-talk between peptide binding and ATP hydrolysis within TAP (10Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Viral proteins are important tools for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of intracellular trafficking, which is exploited by viruses. The structure and function of ICP47 as well as the inhibition mechanism of TAP were analyzed in detail using isolated viral protein (22Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Beinert D. Neumann L. Uebel S. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4694-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Pfänder R. Neumann L. Zweckstetter M. Seger C. Holak T.A. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13692-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In comparison to ICP47, the molecular mechanism of the US6 remained largely unknown mostly due to the lack of isolated viral protein. Therefore, quantitative aspects of the US6-TAP interaction as well as the structure and function of this viral TAP inhibitor were poorly defined. We studied the molecular mechanism and structural aspects of HCMV-US6 in vitro, using purified US6 and TAP co-reconstituted in proteoliposomes.DISCUSSIONApart from their viral role in the pathogenesis of herpesviruses, ICP47 and US6 are central tools for studying the mechanism of peptide translocation by the TAP complex. We show that purified recombinant ER-luminal domain of US6 is essential and sufficient to inhibit the transport activity of TAP in vitro. Glycosylation of US6 is not required for TAP inhibition. US6 causes a specific arrest of the ATPase cycle by blocking ATP binding and hydrolysis. In contrast, ADP and peptide binding are not affected by US6. The IC50 value of the ER-luminal domain for TAP inhibition is determined to be 1 μm. By taking into account that full-length US6 is membrane-anchored, the increase in apparent concentration in the ER membrane results in increased amounts of US6 bound to TAP and a stable association with TAP.These studies show that the molecular mechanism of TAP inhibition by US6 is very different from that of ICP47. ICP47 binds to TAP from the cytosolic side with an affinity of 50 nm, probably promoted by adsorption to the ER membrane (20Ahn K. Meyer T.H. Uebel S. Sempé P. Djaballah H. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Früh K. Tampé R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3247-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 21Tomazin R. Hill A.B. Jugovic P. York I. van Endert P. Ploegh H.L. Andrews D.W. Johnson D.C.

An active domain of 32 amino acids, ICP47-(3–34), was found to be sufficient for TAP inhibition (22Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Specific block of peptide binding by ICP47 leads to inhibition of ATP hydrolysis (10Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, ATP or ADP binding to TAP is not affected by ICP47 (20Ahn K. Meyer T.H. Uebel S. Sempé P. Djaballah H. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Früh K. Tampé R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3247-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In contrast, US6 neither changes the peptide binding affinity nor the amount of high affinity binding sites at the ER membrane. Thus, it is interesting that both herpes viral proteins, US6 and ICP47, cause an inhibition of the peptide-stimulated ATPase activity of the TAP complex. However, in contrast to ICP47, the ER-luminal domain of US6 directly prevents ATP binding to TAP, whereas ICP47 acts indirectly on the ATPase activity by blocking peptide binding. US6 binding is regiospecific, because recombinant US6 blocks TAP only if reconstituted into proteoliposomes but not if added outside as in the case of ICP47. Therefore, we propose that US6 interacts only with the short ER-luminal loops of the TAP complex.By using purified US6 and TAP co-reconstituted in proteoliposomes, we demonstrate that the US6-TAP interaction causes a specific arrest of the ATPase cycle, by blocking the binding of ATP but not ADP to TAP. It has been reported that TAP1 binds ATP more efficiently than TAP2 does (33Müller K.M. Ebensperger C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14032-14037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Russ G. Esquivel F. Yewdell J.W. Cresswell P. Spies T. Bennick J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21312-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas the binding of ADP by both subunits is equivalent (9Alberts P. Daumke O. Deverson E.V. Howard J.C. Knittler M.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 242-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A possible explanation of these findings could be that, in the ground state, ATP or ADP is trapped by the NBD of TAP2 in an “occluded state,” whereas ATP can rapidly exchange at NBD of TAP1 (“open state”). US6 traps the peptide transport complex in a state, in which binding of ATP to TAP1 is blocked (occluded state). With this US6-TAP inhibitory state, the peptide-binding site is fully accessible from the cytosol.During the preparation of this manuscript, Lehner and colleagues (17Hewitt E.W. Gupta S.S. Lehner P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have analyzed US6 function in vivo and reported that US6 inhibits the binding of ATP by TAP. These finding are in line with ourin vitro data, demonstrating that US6 binding stabilizes a conformation in TAP1 that prevents ATP binding and subsequent peptide translocation. However, due to the lack of isolated HCMV protein, mechanistic and quantitative aspects of the US6-TAP interaction are poorly defined. We demonstrate the functional consequences of the stabilization of a transition state within the transport cycle by various assays in vitro. Inhibition of ATP binding to TAP blocks the peptide-stimulated ATPase activity and subsequent peptide translocation by TAP, finally shutting off peptide supply of MHC class I molecules.Apart from mechanistic aspects, we were interested in the structural properties of US6. It has been shown that the protein is glycosylatedin vivo (14Ahn K. Gruhler A. Galocha B. Jones T.R. Wiertz E.J.H.J. Ploegh H.L. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. Früh K.

A. 1997; 94: 6904-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). US6 was found in association with the ER-resident chaperones calnexin and weakly with calreticulin (15Hengel H. Koopmann J.O. Flohr T. Muranyi W. Goulmy E. Hämmerling G.J. Koszinowski U.H. Momburg F. Immunity. 1997; 6: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We provide clear evidence that US6 is sufficient for TAP inhibition, and N-core glycosylation at Asn-52 is not essential. We therefore suggest that glycosylation may assist efficient folding of US6.At least four proteins encoded in the HCMV unique short (US) region are presently known to interfere with antigen processing. As described herein, US6 blocks the TAP-mediated peptide transport. The dislocation and mistargeting of MHC class I to proteasomal degradation is induced by US2 and US11 (35Wiertz E.J.H.J. Jones T.R.

Nelson J.A. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11327-11333Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These US gene products consist of an ER-luminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytosolic tail. The structure of the ER-luminal domain of US2 was recently determined. US2 possesses a typical Ig-like structure composed of seven connected β-sheets, packed face-to-face in a β-sandwich, and is tied up by one disulfide bond (38Gewurz B.E. Gaudet R. Tortorella D. Wang E.W. Ploegh H.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6794-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments based on this structure were used to propose a similar fold for the other members of the US protein family including US6.We provide several lines of evidence that US6 has a unique structure distinct from US2. First, secondary structure analyses demonstrate that the ER-luminal domain of US6 has about 20% α-helices and therefore differs from an Ig-like fold. More importantly, refolded US6 lacking the α-helical content was found to be inactive (Fig. 6 C). These findings indicate that α-helices are essential for US6 function. Second, the site of N-linked glycosylation located at position Asn-52 of US6 was predicted to be a buried core residue in the proposed Ig fold. This is not confirmed by the fact that US6 is glycosylated in vivo (14Ahn K. Gruhler A. Galocha B. Jones T.R. Wiertz E.J.H.J. Ploegh H.L. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. Früh K.

A. 1997; 94: 6904-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Third, Ig-like folds are held together by an essential disulfide bond. Based on the structure of US2, it was speculated that Cys-39 and Cys-127 form such disulfide bridges (38Gewurz B.E. Gaudet R. Tortorella D. Wang E.W. Ploegh H.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6794-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The active luminal domain of US6 consists of eight cysteines. Our data show that all of them are involved in the formation of four intramolecular disulfide bonds. Endopeptidase cleavage and subsequent MALDI-mass spectrometry analysis show that Cys-127 forms a disulfide bridge with the neighbored Cys-129 and not with Cys-39. 2S. Hutschenreiter, C. Kyritsis, and R. Tampé, unpublished data. The N-terminal region of US6 seems to be stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bridges, because an N-terminal epitope is less accessible for antibodies if disulfide bonds are formed (Fig. 2).In comparison to herpes simplex viral protein ICP47, US6 has a more complex structure. Residues 3–34 have been identified to be the active domain of ICP47 (22Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The protein is unstructured in aqueous solution and forms a helix-linker-helix motif upon association with membranes (23Beinert D. Neumann L. Uebel S. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4694-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Pfänder R. Neumann L. Zweckstetter M. Seger C. Holak T.A. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13692-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In summary, we show that US6 possesses structural and mechanistic properties distinct from US2 and ICP47.Recent investigations indicate that the C-terminal region of the ER-luminal domain of US6 might be critical for function, whereas the N-terminal region maintains the stability of US6 in vivo (17Hewitt E.W. Gupta S.S. Lehner P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Systematic truncation studies will elucidate the mechanistic and structural basis of the US6-TAP interaction. In this respect it will be interesting to determine the intramolecular cysteine network. With thein vitro system described, important questions about the interaction sites and the structure of US6 can be addressed. During evolution vertebrates developed an adaptive immune system to protect themselves from a vast number of pathogens by using the host as a breeding ground. To eliminate intracellular pathogens, an efficient machinery for antigen processing has been evolved, and within this machinery the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)1 plays a key role (for review see Refs. 1Pamer E.

Although entirely unrelated, ICP47, an immediate early gene product of herpes simplex virus, focuses on the same target to shut down antigen processing (18Früh K. Ahn K. Djaballah H.

However, in contrast to US6, ICP47 blocks a very early step in the translocation cycle, which is peptide binding to TAP (20Ahn K. Meyer T.H. Uebel S. Sempé P. Djaballah H. Yang Y. Peterson P.A.

Tampe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Viral proteins are important tools for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of intracellular trafficking, which is exploited by viruses. The structure and function of ICP47 as well as the inhibition mechanism of TAP were analyzed in detail using isolated viral protein (22Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampé R. J. Mol.

In comparison to ICP47, the molecular mechanism of the US6 remained largely unknown mostly due to the lack of isolated viral protein. Therefore, quantitative aspects of the US6-TAP interaction as well as the structure and function of this viral TAP inhibitor were poorly defined. We studied the molecular mechanism and structural aspects of HCMV-US6 in vitro, using purified US6 and TAP co-reconstituted in proteoliposomes. DISCUSSIONApart from their viral role in the pathogenesis of herpesviruses, ICP47 and US6 are central tools for studying the mechanism of peptide translocation by the TAP complex. We show that purified recombinant ER-luminal domain of US6 is essential and sufficient to inhibit the transport activity of TAP in vitro. Glycosylation of US6 is not required for TAP inhibition. US6 causes a specific arrest of the ATPase cycle by blocking ATP binding and hydrolysis. In contrast, ADP and peptide binding are not affected by US6. The IC50 value of the ER-luminal domain for TAP inhibition is determined to be 1 μm. By taki"

Therefore, it is often difficult to distinguish the effects of redox imbalance from those of oxidative stress. The objective of this study was to determine the role of redox imbalance independent of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, in proliferation of human colonic CaCo-2 cells. Low concentrations of diamide plus 1,3-bis(2 chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) increased intracellular GSSG and decreased GSH and the GSH:GSSG ratio. These changes occurred within 30 min, which preceded a decrease in thymidine incorporation at 6 and 24 h. ROS formation was not detected under these conditions. This suppression of cell proliferative activity was attenuated by N-acetyl cysteine, in parallel with restoration of the intracellular GSH redox status. dl-buthionine-[S, R]-sulfoximine (BSO) decreased intracellular GSH level, but did not change the GSH:GSSG ratio. BSO alone had no effect on cell proliferation, but its presence exaggerated the suppressive effect of diamide plus BCNU. Flow cytometric analysis showed that cells were arrested at G1-to-S transition and G2/M phase. Collectively, this study shows that mild intracellular redox imbalance inhibited cell proliferation independent of ROS generation. Moreover, cells with compromised cellular GSH were susceptible to redox imbalance-induced inhibition of proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2041136179,"The endocannabinoid signaling system is believed to play a down-regulatory role in the control of cell functions. However, little is known about the factors activating endocannabinoid synthesis and which of two known endocannabinoids, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or N-arachidonoylethanolamine (20:4n-6 NAE, anandamide), is of physiological importance. We approached these questions by studying a possible link between cell activation with 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (platelet-activating factor, PAF) and the generation of 2-AG and anandamide in human platelets and mouse P388D1 macrophages. Human platelets responded to stimulation with the production of various 1- and 2-monoacylglycerols, including 2-AG, whereas stimulation of P388D1 macrophages induced the rapid and selective generation of 2-AG, which was immediately released into the medium. The effect of PAF was receptor mediated, as PAF receptor antagonist BN52021 blocked the effect. The treatment did not change the content of anandamide in either macrophages or platelet-rich plasma. The inhibitors of PI- and PC-specific phospholipases C (U73122 and D609) as well as PI3-kinase inhibitor (wortmannin) attenuated PAF-induced 2-AG production in macrophages. These data suggest a direct role for the endocannabinoid system in controlling immune cell activation status and indicate that 2-AG rather than anandamide is the endocannabinoid rapidly produced in response to proinflammatory stimulation of immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W1965590635,"We have explored the role of the recently discovered second messenger nicotinic acid adenine nucleotide phosphate (NAADP+) in Ca2+ swings that accompany the fertilization process in starfish oocytes. The injection of NAADP+ deep into the cytoplasm of oocytes matured by the hormone 1-methyladenine (1-MA), mobilized Ca2+ exclusively in the cortical layer, showing that the NAADP+-sensitive Ca2+ pool is restricted to the subplasma membrane region of the cell. At variance with this, InsP3 initiated the liberation of Ca2+ next to the point of injection in the center of the cell. The initial cortical Ca2+ liberation induced by NAADP+ was followed by a spreading of the Ca2+ wave to the remainder of the cell and by a massive cortical granule exocytosis similar to that routinely observed on injection of InsP3. A striking difference in the responses to NAADP+ and InsP3 was revealed by the removal of the nucleus from immature oocytes, i.e., from oocytes not treated with 1-MA. Whereas the Ca2+ response and the cortical granule exocytosis induced by NAADP+ were unaffected by the removal of the nucleus, the Ca2+ response promoted by InsP3 was significantly slowed. In addition, the cortical granule exocytosis was completely abolished. When enucleated oocytes were fertilized, the spermatozoon still promoted the Ca2+ wave and normal cortical exocytosis, strongly suggesting that the Ca2+ response was mediated by NAADP+ and not by InsP3. InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores may mediate the propagation of the wave initiated by NAADP+ since its spreading was strongly affected by removal of the nucleus."

Actin has been proposed to play both a positive and negative role in the regulation of various vesicle trafficking events. In some systems, polymerized actin has been implicated as a barrier that undergoes depolymerization during vesicle trafficking (20Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R.

To explore the functional role of actin polymerization in GLUT4 translocation, we have reconstituted the formation of actin comet tails on GLUT4 vesicles using Xenopus egg extracts in vitro and in a broken adipocyte cell system. These data demonstrate that both GTPγS plus sodium orthovanadate and insulin stimulation result in an N-WASP-dependent formation of comet tails on GLUT4-containing intracellular vesicles. Furthermore, expression of a dominant-interfering N-WASP mutant (N-WASP/ΔVCA) partially inhibited both insulin- and GTPγS-induced GLUT4 translocation in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Clostridum difficile toxin B was obtained from Techlab Inc. (Blacksburg, VA), and latrunculin B was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The c-Myc epitope 9E10 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Rhodamine-phalloidin, streptolysin-O (SL-O), and rhodamine-actin were purchased from Sigma and Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO), respectively. The pGLUT4-enhanced green fluorescent protein (GLUT4-EGFP) was prepared as described previously (37Chiang S.-H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Thurmond D.C. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R.

The Myc epitope-tagged GLUT4 was a generous gift from Dr. Amira Klip and was used to generate the double tagged GLUT4 fusion protein Myc-GLUT4-EGFP. A recombinant adenovirus encoding for GLUT4-EGFP (Ad-GLUT4-EGFP) was prepared by the University of Iowa Vector Core. N-WASP cDNA was prepared by PCR from Quick Clone rat cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and was ligated into pcDNA3 with a Myc-tagged sequence at the amino-terminal region. The N-WASP/ΔVCA cDNA was also generated by PCR and was cloned into pcDNA3. All other chemicals were reagent grade or the best quality commercially available. 3T3L1 preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% calf serum at 37 °C in a 8% CO2 atmosphere, induced to differentiate into adipocytes, and transfected by electroporation as described previously (38Min J.

The cells were then allowed to adhere to tissue culture dishes for 24 h, and the adipocytes were then serum-starved for 2 h prior to experiments. In some experiments, the electroporated adipocytes were seeded on coverslips. Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected by electroporation as described previously (39Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J.

To quantitate the cell surface exposure of GLUT4, adipocytes were transfected with a Myc-GLUT4-EGFP cDNA, and nonpermeabilized cells were labeled with the Myc 9E10 antibody followed by Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody. The average red fluorescent and average green fluorescent pixel intensity of an entire image were calculated by the Zeiss LSM 510 software. The ratio for 10 cells was averaged as a measure for relative GLUT4 translocation. Nonspecific background fluorescence was determined by using cells transfected with GLUT4-EGFP and labeled in the same manner as cells transfected with Myc-GLUT4-EGFP. The microinjection and visualization of single 3T3L1 adipocytes was performed as described previously (40Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E.

Briefly, the cells were grown on coverslips, and prior to microinjection, the medium was changed to Lebovitz's L-15 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were impaled using the Eppendorf model 5171 micromanipulator, and nuclei were injected with 50 or 200 μg/ml of cDNAs in 100 mm KCl, 5 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.2, with an Eppendorf model 5246 transjector. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 h and placed into a perfusion chamber maintained at 37 °C and visualized by time lapse confocal fluorescence microscopy. Crude Xenopusegg extracts were prepared as described previously with slight modifications (33Ma L. Cantley L.C. Janmey P.A. Kirschner M.W. J.

Briefly, the Xenopus laevis eggs were dejellied in 2% cysteine, pH 7.8, washed with XB solution (100 mm KCl, 50 mm sucrose, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, adjusted with KOH) and then washed twice with XB solution containing 5 mm EGTA and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin. The eggs were homogenized at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor at 4 °C for 15 min. The cytoplasmic layer was removed, and 120 volume of energy mix (150 mm creatine phosphate, 10 mmATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm MgCl2) and 11000 volume of leupeptin (10 mg/ml) were added. The crude egg extract was centrifuged at 55,000 rpm in a SW60 rotor at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with XB solution containing 5 mm EGTA and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin and centrifuged at 60,000 rpm in a SW60 rotor at 4 °C for 1 h. The clarified cytosol was concentrated to the original volume using a Centriprep 3 concentrator (Millipore) and snap frozen in separate aliquots for storage at −80 °C. Differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were infected by Ad-GLUT4-EGFP adenovirus vector and allowed to express GLUT4-EGFP for 24 h. After 3 h of serum starvation, the adipocytes were treated without or with 100 nm insulin for 5 min and washed twice with ice-cold homogenized buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH) containing 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin. They were scraped and homogenized by passage through a 27 gauge needle (seven times for vesicle preparation and two times for broken cell preparation). The postnuclear supernatant, which contains GLUT4-EGFP vesicle, was obtained by a centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet was used for actin motility assay. Actin-based motility was performed in 4 μl of vesicle-free Xenopus egg extracts containing a final concentration of 3 μm rhodamine labeled G-actin plus 1 μl of postnuclear supernatant or 1 μl of the cell pellet (resuspened in 10 volumes of homogenate buffer) of 3T3L1 homogenates. A 1-μl aliquot of the cell-free motility reaction was placed on a glass slide under a coverslip, and rhodamine and EGFP images were acquired every 4 s using a LSM510 Zeiss confocal microscope. All digital images were subsequently cropped and annotated using Adobe Premiere 5.0 software on a Macintosh computer. Differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were permeabilized with SL-O as described previously (42Elmendorf J.S. Chen D. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13289-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 3T3L1 adipocytes were washed three times with intracellular (ICR) buffer (140 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.15, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmEGTA, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) and incubated in intracellular buffer containing 20 units/ml of activated SL-O for 5 min at 37 °C. Under these conditions, more than 95% of the cells were permeabilized based upon incorporation of propidium iodide. Following SL-O permeabilization, the cells were washed twice with ICR buffer (intracellular buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol and enriched with an ATP-regenerating system: 40 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 1 mm ATP). GLUT4-EGFP translocation assay was performed by incubating the cells in ICR buffer containing 100 μm GTPγS for 15 min at 37 °C. Previous studies have demonstrated that low speed X. laevis egg extracts that contain endogenous vesicles induce actin polymerization when incubated with GTPγS and sodium orthovanadate (33Ma L. Cantley L.C. Janmey P.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 35Moreau V. Way M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, high speed extracts that are depleted of endogenous vesicles are unable to induce actin polymerization unless exogenous membrane vesicles are added (33Ma L. Cantley L.C. Janmey P.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To test whether GLUT4-containing vesicles obtained from 3T3L1 adipocytes have the ability to polymerize actin in the presence of GTPγS and sodium orthovanadate, a GLUT4-EGFP-containing intracellular membrane fraction was obtained from serum-starved 3T3L1 adipocytes and was subjected to the in vitro actin polymerization assay system using the high speed vesicle-free egg extract supernatants. The addition of GTPγS (100 μm) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm) to the reaction mixture resulted in an induction of actin comet tails on the GLUT4-EGFP vesicles concomitant with random GLUT4 motility by time lapse imaging (Fig.1A and supplementary material), whereas the vesicle fraction itself did not induce actin polymerization (data not shown). We have recently reported that although actin-yellow fluorescent protein expression can be used to observed gross changes in adipocyte actin structures, the resolution is insufficient to resolve small changes in actin polymerization such as comet tailing (19Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Because living cells cannot be visualized using rhodamine-actin, we examined actin polymerization in gently sheared (broken) 3T3L1 adipocyte cell preparations incubated with the high speed vesicle-free egg supernatants (Fig. 1B). Gentle shearing of adipocytes expressing GLUT4-EGFP resulted in a random distribution of small vesicle compartments within the cell, and the addition of the vesicle-free egg extracts and rhodamine-actin only resulted in a small degree of discreet actin polymerization (Fig. 1B,panel a). In contrast, the addition of GTPγS and sodium orthovanadate to the reaction mixture resulted in a large amount of actin polymerization on the GLUT4-EGFP-containing vesicles with enhanced motility (Fig. 1B, panel b). As a control, latrunculin B completely inhibited the formation of actin comet tails on GLUT4-EGFP-containing vesicles (Fig. 1B,panel c). Recent studies have demonstrated that activated Cdc42, a structurally related Rho family homolog, can induce actin comet tails on membrane vesicles in an N-WASP-dependent manner (33Ma L. Cantley L.C. Janmey P.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 34Ma L. Rohatgi R. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15362-15367Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 35Moreau V. Way M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). N-WASP appears to function as a scaffolding protein that contains a central binding region for several Rho family small GTP-binding proteins and a carboxyl-terminal domain that interacts with both monomeric actin and the Arp2/3 complex (32Taunton J. Rowning B.A. Coughlin M.L. Wu M. Moon R.T. Mitchison T.J. Larabell C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 36Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I.

Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). In this manner, N-WASP is thought to mediate upstream activation of actin nucleation and polymerization resulting in the formation of actin comet tails. To determine whether N-WASP plays a similar role in the formation of GLUT4 vesicle comet tails, we examined the effect of a dominant-interfering N-WASP GST fusion protein (N-WASP/ΔVCA) that lacks the monomeric actin- and Arp2/3-binding sites. The addition of the GST N-WASP/ΔVCA fusion protein resulted in a marked inhibition of GTPγS plus sodium orthovanadate-induced actin polymerization in the broken adipocyte preparation (Fig. 1B, panel d). In contrast, the addition of a wild type N-WASP GST fusion protein had no significant effect (data not shown). These data demonstrate that GLUT4 intracellular vesicles have the capability to nucleate actin and generate actin comet tails through an N-WASP-dependent mechanism. Recently we and others have reported that insulin stimulation results in cortical actin remodeling followed by an increase in polymerized actin in the perinuclear region and that these actin dynamics are essential for insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation (19Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 44Khayat Z.A. Tong P. Yaworsky K. Bloch R.J. Klip A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 279-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Tong P. Khayat Z.A. Huang C. Patel N. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To further investigate the functional role of actin remodeling in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation, we next examined the ability of insulin to induce actin comet tails on GLUT4-containing vesicles (Fig. 2). As previously observed, broken adipocytes from control cells displayed the presence of GLUT4-EGFP with relatively low levels of polymerized actin (Fig.2A, panel a). In contrast, broken adipocytes isolated from insulin-stimulated cells resulted in a substantial amount of actin polymerization (Fig. 2A, panel b). In addition, many of the actin comet tail structures were found on GLUT4-EGFP-containing vesicles and could be observed to induce random GLUT4 motility by time lapse imaging (Fig. 2B and supplementary materials). Latrunculin B completely inhibited the formation of actin comet tails on GLUT4-EGFP-containing vesicles (Fig.2A, panel c). Similarly, the addition of N-WASP/ΔVCA strongly inhibited insulin-induced actin polymerization (Fig. 2A, panel d), whereas wild type N-WASP had no significant effect (data not shown). Previously, we have reported that insulin does not induce Cdc42 activation in adipocytes but can activate a structurally related Rho family member, TC10 (37Chiang S.-H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Thurmond D.C. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TC10 has been reported to interact with N-WASP in a yeast two-hybrid system assay and to associate with N-WASP in vivo (46Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Tatsis N. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Kanzaki, M., Watson, R. T., Stamnes, M., Saltiel, A. R., and Pessin, J. E. (2001)Google Scholar). Therefore, to assess a possible involvement of Rho family GTP-binding proteins on the formation of actin comet tails in the insulin-stimulated adipocytes, we utilized C. difficile toxin B, a specific inhibitor for Rho family small GTP-binding proteins, including TC10. Broken adipocytes from Toxin B-treated cells were devoid of any insulin-induced actin polymerization or GLUT4 vesicle comet tails (Fig. 2A,panel e). These data demonstrate that insulin stimulation of intact cells activates the necessary cellular machinery to induced GLUT4 vesicle comet tails following in vitro reconstitution. In addition, insulin stimulation of actin polymerization is dependent upon both N-WASP and a Rho family member small GTP-binding protein, most likely TC10. It is well established that both insulin and GTPγS are potent stimulators of GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes (42Elmendorf J.S. Chen D. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13289-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 48Baldini G. Holman R. Charron M.J. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because both of these agents also induce actin comet tails on GLUT4 vesicles in an N-WASP-dependent manner, we next examined the effect of the dominant-interfering N-WASP mutant on GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 3). Expression of GLUT4-EGFP in 3T3L1 adipocytes resulted in the typical GLUT4 distribution to the perinuclear region and in small vesicle compartments scattered throughout the cell. In contrast, insulin stimulation induced a robust redistribution of GLUT4-EGFP to the plasma membrane. As summarized in Fig. 3A, in the basal state 16.7 ± 8.3% of the cells displayed a plasma membrane localization of GLUT4-EGFP. In contrast, following insulin stimulation plasma membrane-distributed GLUT4-EGFP was observed in 78.7 ± 4.3% of the cells. Expression of N-WASP/WT did not alter the insulin stimulation of GLUT4-EGFP translocation, whereas expression of N-WASP/ΔVCA resulted in a partial but significant inhibition of insulin-induced GLUT4-EGFP translocation (56.6 ± 5.1%). Similarly, GTPγS treatment of SL-O permeabilized adipocytes resulted in 64.1 ± 8.9% of the cells displaying a plasma membrane GLUT4-EGFP distribution compared with 14.7 ± 4.6% in the basal state. As observed with insulin stimulation, expression of N-WASP/WT did not have any significant effect of GTPγS-stimulated GLUT4-EGFP translocation, whereas N-WASP/ΔVCA reduced translocation to 38.7 ± 4.9% of the cells. To confirm the inhibitory effect of N-WASP/ΔVCA, we utilized a quantitative assay of translocation in which the relative surface exposure of a Myc-GLUT4-EGFP fusion protein is compared with the total amount of GLUT4 expression by comparing the ratio Myc label intensity to that of EGFP intensity (51Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4785-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consistent with the counting of plasma membrane rim fluorescence, expression of N-WASP/ΔVCA inhibited the insulin-stimulated cell surface exposure of the Myc epitope to 72% ± 7.0% compared with the control cells. Together, these data demonstrate that disruption of actin polymerization and GLUT4 vesicle comet tails by expression of a dominant-interfering N-WASP mutant partially inhibits both insulin- and GTPγS-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. In contrast to fibroblasts, adipocytes do not have significant amounts of stress fiber actin but instead display polymerized actin that is restricted to the perinuclear region and cortical actin that is juxtaposed to the plasma membrane (19Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of N-WASP on cortical actin, 3T3L1 adipocyte nuclei were microinjected with a cDNA encoding a Myc epitope-tagged N-WASP/WT or N-WASP/ΔVCA followed by rhodamine-phalloidin staining (Fig. 4). As previously observed, rhodamine-phalloidin labeling primarily detected a strong ring of cortical actin along the inner surface of the plasma membrane (Fig. 4,panels b and e). The expressed N-WASP/WT and N-WASP/ΔVCA proteins were localized in a small punctate distribution dispersed throughout the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 4, panels aand d). In addition, N-WASP/ΔVCA was also found to localize juxtaposed to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4, panel d). In any case, cortical actin labeling was not affected by expression of either N-WASP/WT or N-WASP/ΔVCA. These data demonstrate that the maintenance of cortical actin structure in 3T3L1 adipocytes is not N-WASP-dependent. In conclusion, several studies have reported that insulin-stimulated actin remodeling occurs both beneath the plasma membrane (cortical actin) and in the perinuclear regions that co-localizes with the major intracellular GLUT4 storage sites (19Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In addition, alterations in actin polymerization affect multiple membrane transport processes and, in particular, insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (15Omata W. Shibata H. Li L. Takata K.

Invest. 2001; 108: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that insulin can induce actin comet tails on GLUT4-containing intracellular storage vesicles. This process is dependent upon both a Rho family member GTP-binding protein and the neural Wisckott-Aldrich syndrome protein, N-WASP. Because insulin does not function to activate Cdc42 in adipocytes (37Chiang S.-H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Thurmond D.C. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), these data further support a role for another member of this family such as TC10. This is consistent with the insulin activation of TC10, the interaction of active TC10 with N-WASP, and the fact that expression of TC10 has marked effects on GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes. The observation that dominant-interfering N-WASP only partially inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation is consistent with a study examining general membrane trafficking. In this case, actin polymerization was not essential but increased the efficiency of membrane transport (52Hirschberg K. Miller C.M. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E.D. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1485-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Thus, although the precise functional role of GLUT4 vesicle actin comet tails on the translocation process remains to be established, these data are most consistent with a role in GLUT4 trafficking out of the perinuclear storage sites.

Biochemical studies in yeast and mammals have shown that a dimeric complex of the MCM4/6/7 heterotrimer contains 3′–5′ DNA helicase activity, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding, and DNA-dependent ATPase activities (15Lee J.K.

Zinc fingers were first identified as zinc-binding domains important for protein-DNA interactions (20Hanas J.S. Hazuda D.J. Bogenhagen D.F. Wu F.Y. Wu C.W. J. Biol.

Since their discovery, zinc finger domains have been implicated in diverse functions, including ssDNA and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding, RNA binding, and protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Refs. 24Leon O. Roth M. Biol. Res. 2000; 33: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and 26Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The primary amino acid sequences of the eukaryotic MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 proteins from all organisms contain a putative zinc finger motif of the C4 type, either CX2CXnCX2C (MCM2) or CX2CXnCX4C (MCM4, -6, and -7) (Fig. 1A) (2Tye B.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The role of the zinc finger domain in MCM2 function was suggested byin vivo mutational analyses conducted in S. cerevisiae (27Yan H. Gibson S. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In these studies, several substitutions were made in the second cysteine pair. None of the mutant proteins supported cell growth, suggesting an essential function for the putative zinc-binding domain of MCM2. However, the biochemical properties of the MCM2 zinc finger mutant were not characterized, and the roles of the zinc finger domains in MCM4, -6, or -7 have not yet been determined. Conservation of the domain from archaea to eukarya (Fig. 1) in a nonconserved region of the MCM family of proteins suggests the importance of the zinc finger domain in MCM function (2Tye B.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutational analyses of zinc finger domains in several viral helicases have shown these motifs to be important for helicase activity (28van Dinten L.C. van Tol H. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5213-5223Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,29Biswas N. Weller S.K. J. Biol.

This conclusion is based in large part on the complete genome sequences of several members of this domain and the biochemical properties of the replication proteins that have been studied. Homologues of proteins involved in eukaryotic DNA replication have been identified within archaeal genomes, whereas bacterial DNA replication proteins have only limited sequence similarity to the eukaryotic ones. To date, at least one MCM homologue has been identified in all archaeal species studied (Fig.1B) (32Kelman Z. Curr. Protein Peptide Sci. 2000; 1: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 33Myllykallio H. Forterre P.

Biochemical studies with the single MCM homologue from the thermophilic archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ΔH (Mth) showed that it forms a ring-shaped dodecamer with biochemical properties similar to the eukaryotic MCM4/6/7 complex, including ssDNA binding, ATPase activity stimulated by DNA, and 3′ to 5′ helicase activity that is dependent upon ATP hydrolysis (see Refs. 34Kelman Z.

A. 2000; 97: 2399-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that MCM is associated with chromatin inPyrococcus abyssi (38Matsunaga F. Forterre P. Ishino Y. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11152-11157Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The archaeal domain can be divided into two main kingdoms: euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota (39Barns S.M. Delwiche C.F. Palmer J.D. Pace N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9188-9193Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). A zinc finger domain of the C4 type has been identified in all MCM homologues from the euryarchaeota kingdom, including the Mth MCM (Fig. 1B). Only the first Cys pair is present in the two identified MCM homologues from the crenarchaeota kingdom (Fig. 1B). In order to elucidate the roles played by the zinc finger domain in mthMCM function, the motif was mutated by substituting the last Cys to Ser, resulting in a C3S domain. In this study, the expression, purification, and biochemical properties of the mutant protein are described. It is shown that while the wild-type protein binds zinc, the mutant enzyme does not. While zinc binding is not needed for the oligomeric structure of the MCM complex, it is needed for efficient ssDNA binding, stimulation of ATPase activity by DNA, and helicase activity. Labeled and unlabeled dNTPs and rNTPs were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc., and AMP-PNP was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Single-stranded M13mp18, single-stranded φX174, and double-stranded φX174 DNAs were from New England Biolabs, and oligonucleotides were synthesized by the CARB DNA synthesis facility. Buffer A contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Buffer B contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. Buffer C contained 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). The oligonucleotide used in preparation of the helicase substrates was a 74-mer, 5′-(dT)40CGCGCGGGGAGAGGCGGTTTGCGTATTGGGCGCC-3′, referred to as M13-1T. After labeling with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, the oligonucleotide was annealed to a single-stranded M13mp18 in a ratio of 1:2 and purified over a 1-ml Sephacryl HS-300-HR column (Sigma). Gel mobility shift assays were performed with either the M13-1T oligonucleotide; a 29-mer, Z149 (5′-AAAGCGGCCGCGCAGCCAACTCAGCTTCC-3′); a 50-mer, Hel-1 (5′-GGCCAACCGATCAAGTGCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGAGCCCGCGCG-3′), or a 110-mer, Hel-4 (5′-CGCGCGGGCTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTGACTGGGCACTTGATCGGTTGGCC(dT)60-3′) labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The MCM zinc finger mutant was constructed in the pET-21 (Novagene) plasmid containing the wild-type MCM gene with a His10 tag at the C terminus of the protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with two complementary oligonucleotide primers Z207 (5′-GAGCCATCACTCTGCTCAGAGAGTGGTGGGAGATCCTTCAGGC-3′) and Z208 (5′-GCCTGAAGGATCTCCCACCACTCTCTGAGCAGAGTGATGGCTC-3′). The mutated residues are underlined. The resulting construct contains a Cys to Ser substitution at residue 158 located in the second Cys pair of the zinc finger motif (Fig. 1B). Following mutagenesis, the entire gene was sequenced to ensure that no additional mutations were created. The wild-type and mutant MCM proteins were overexpressed and purified fromEscherichia coli cells essentially as previously described (34Kelman Z. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications. All proteins were overexpressed using the E. coli cells RIL CondoPlas (Stratagene) at either 37 °C (wild type and a protein with a mutation at the Walker-A motif (Lys → Ala)) or 24 °C (zinc finger mutant) in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium in the presence of appropriate antibiotics. Protein expression was induced and the proteins were purified to near homogeneity using Ni2+-chelate, Q-Sepharose, and glycerol gradient sedimentation. The glycerol gradient fractions were used in the experiments described below. Before glycerol gradient purification, the proteins were stored in buffer A at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with BSA as the standard. A portion of the fraction purified on Q-Sepharose (300 μg) was applied to a 5-ml 20–40% glycerol gradient in buffer A, containing 200 or 500 mmNaCl. After centrifugation at 45,000 rpm (190,000 × g) for 13 h in a SW 50.1 rotor at 4 °C, fractions (300 μl) were collected from the bottom of the tube. The distribution of the mthMCM proteins was determined following 10% SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). A portion of the protein fraction purified on Q-Sepharose (100 μg in 100 μl of buffer A) was applied to a Superose-6 gel filtration column (HR10/30; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A. Fractions (250 μl) were collected and analyzed for the presence of the mthMCM proteins by fractionation on a 10% SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). To determine the presence or absence of zinc in the wild-type and mutant MCM proteins, a portion of the isolated proteins was dialyzed for 5 h against buffer B. The protein solutions were diluted with quartz-distilled water to reduce the level of dissolved solids and slightly acidified with nitric acid (Ultrex; J. T. Baker). Scandium was added as an internal standard at a concentration of 10 ng/g. All samples were measured using a VG PQ2 quadrupole ICP-MS system (VG Elemental) operated in a peak jumping mode. Samples were introduced into the instrument using a microconcentric nebulizer (CETAC) operated at a liquid uptake rate of 125 μl/min. Zinc measurements were made using the 66Zn isotope with three replicate 30-s integrations at a dwell time of 10 ms. All measurements were normalized to the internal standard response. The zinc concentrations were calculated from a response curve generated from zinc calibration standard solutions. ATPase activity was measured in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 1 nmol of ATP containing 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the absence of DNA or in the presence of 50 ng of single-stranded or double-stranded φX174 DNA (0.15 nmol as nucleotides) and various protein concentrations. After incubation at 60 °C for 60 min, an aliquot (1 μl) was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer plate, and ATP and Pi were separated by chromatography in 1 mformic acid plus 0.5 m LiCl. The extent of ATP hydrolysis was quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) analysis. DNA helicase activity was measured in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 25 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 5 fmol of 32P-labeled DNA substrate (5000–6000 cpm/fmol) and wild-type or mutant proteins. After incubation at 60 °C for 1 h, the reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 5× loading buffer (100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 50% glycerol), and aliquots were loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) and electrophoresed for 3 h at 200 V at 4 °C. Complexes formed between the enzymes and ssDNA were detected by a gel mobility shift assay in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm sodium acetate, 8 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 20 fmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (2000–3000 cpm/fmol), and various protein concentrations. After incubation at 60 °C for 20 min, 5 μl of 5× loading buffer (0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 50% glycerol) were added to stop the reaction. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were electrophoresed for 3 h at 200 V at 4 °C through a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 6 mm magnesium acetate and 5% glycerol in 0.5 × TBE. A nitrocellulose filter binding assay was carried out by incubating varying amounts of the mthMCM wild-type or mutant proteins at 65 °C for 10 min in 25 μl of buffer C containing 50 fmol of 5′ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (either M13-1T or Hel-4) (5000 cpm/fmol) in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP. After incubation, the mixture was filtered through an alkaline-washed nitrocellulose filter (HA 0.45 μm; Millipore) (40McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which was then washed with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5). The radioactivity adsorbed to the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The UV-cross-linking experiments were performed using 500 ng of the wild-type enzyme as well as the Lys → Ala and zinc finger mutants essentially as previously described (41Grabowski B. Kelman Z. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture containing 3.3 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 250 ng BSA. The samples were incubated for 10 min at 65 °C followed by exposure to 2.5 J/cm2 UV irradiation in a model 2400 Stratalinker (Stratagene) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography. A zinc finger motif of the type C4 has been identified in all archaea of the euryarchaeota kingdom for which the complete genome is known (Fig.1B). To determine whether this domain binds zinc and to examine the role of the domain in MCM activity, one of the Cys residues in the second Cys pair was mutated to Ser, resulting in a C3S motif. The mutant protein was expressed and purified from E. coli cells using the protocol previously described for the purification of the wild-type enzyme (34Kelman Z. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The ability of the purified wild-type and mutant enzymes to bind zinc was determined using the ICP-MS system. While 0.6 mol of zinc were bound to 1 mol of the wild-type protein, only 0.08 mol were bound to the mutant enzyme. These results illustrate that, as predicted from the primary amino acid sequence, the archaeal MCM protein contains a functional zinc-binding domain. Submolar amounts of zinc in the wild-type proteins can be attributed to the loss of ions during the extensive purification steps. There are many examples in which zinc finger domains participate in protein-protein interactions (for examples, see Refs. 24Leon O. Roth M. Biol. Res. 2000; 33: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and 25Raman C.S. Martasek P. Marsters B. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. Structural Themes Determining Function in Nitric Oxide Synthases: The Porphyrin Handbook. 4. Academic Press, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). Previous studies with the wild-type mthMCM showed that the protein forms a double hexamer in solution with a native mass of about 1 MDa (Fig. 2) (34Kelman Z. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 35Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15049-15059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of the mutation in the zinc-binding domain on the oligomeric structure of mthMCM was determined using gel filtration (Fig. 2) and glycerol gradient sedimentation (data not shown). SDS-PAGE of fractions obtained by the glycerol gradient and gel filtration (Fig.2) yielded protein peaks at similar positions for the wild-type (Fig.2A) and mutant proteins (Fig. 2B). The protein peaks were detected at a position (fractions 36 and 37) that is larger than thyroglobulin (660 kDa) and is similar to that previously reported for the wild-type enzyme (34Kelman Z. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 35Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15049-15059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggest that the zinc finger of the mthMCM protein is not needed to stabilize protein-protein interactions within the MCM complex. The zinc finger mutant, however, migrates at a slightly lower apparent molecular mass during gel filtration (Fig. 2) and at a slightly larger apparent molecular mass during glycerol gradient centrifugation (data not shown). This may indicate a more compact structure of the mthMCM protein in the absence of zinc. Studies performed with the mthMCM demonstrated that the protein binds ssDNA in the presence of magnesium (34Kelman Z. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 35Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Since zinc fingers have been shown to participate in protein-DNA interactions, the effect of the mutation at the zinc finger domain on ssDNA binding was determined using the gel mobility shift (Fig.3A) and filter binding (Fig.3B) assays. For these studies, 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with increasing amounts of wild-type and mutant forms of the mthMCM protein in the presence or absence of ATP. In the gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 3A), the wild-type enzyme (lanes 2–5), as well as the zinc finger (lanes 6–9) and Walker-A (Lys → Ala, lanes 10 and 11) mutants, all bound ssDNA. However, the two mutant proteins differ from the wild type in binding activity and pattern of interaction with ssDNA. At each concentration studied and in the presence or absence of ATP, the wild-type mthMCM showed a higher binding activity than the zinc finger mutant, with close to a 3-fold difference (compare lane 2 with lane 6, lane 3 with lane 7, lane 4 with lane 8, and lane 5 with lane 9). In the absence of ATP, the wild-type protein bound DNA about as well as the ATP-binding mutant (compare lane 5 with lane 11). The results of the complementary nitrocellulose filter binding assay (Fig. 3B) are similar. A surprising result in both assays was the improvement in DNA binding by the zinc mutant in the presence of ATP, suggesting that nucleotide binding might stabilize the mutant protein. In the gel mobility shift assay, but not the nitrocellulose filter-binding assay, the Lys → Ala mutant exhibited lower DNA binding activity in the presence of ATP. This discrepancy may be explained by the longer incubation time and harsher conditions of the gel mobility shift assay, compared with the filter binding assay, which measures weaker and more transient associations. In the presence of ATP, the wild-type protein forms two distinct shifted bands (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4), suggesting two modes of interaction with DNA, whereas in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3A, lane 5), only a slower migrating band is observed. The zinc finger mutant, however, forms only the slower migrating band, whether ATP is present (Fig. 3A,lanes 6–8) or not (Fig. 3A,lane 9). When a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, AMP-PNP, was used, only the slower migrating band could be detected with both the wild-type and the zinc mutant (data not shown), suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is needed to produce the faster migrating form of the protein-DNA complex. In support of this notion, when the wild-type protein was incubated with ssDNA in the presence of ATP but at lower temperatures (4 and 24 °C) that cannot support the ATPase and helicase activities of mthMCM (35Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 36Shechter D.F. Ying C.Y. Gautier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15049-15059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), only the slower migrating band could be detected. In addition, a mthMCM protein with a mutation at the Walker-A motif (Lys → Ala; lanes 10 and 11), which cannot bind ATP, exhibits the slower but not the faster migrating band, similar to the zinc finger mutant and the wild-type enzyme in the absence of ATP. As shown in Fig. 3, the mthMCM zinc mutant binds DNA in a different fashion from the wild-type enzyme. In the absence of ATP, the zinc mutant has the lowest binding activity of all of the proteins tested. However, in the presence of ATP, the DNA binding activity of the zinc mutant improves significantly, suggesting that the protein interactions with DNA may be stabilized by the nucleotide. Nevertheless, DNA binding activity by the mutant is still lower than that of the wild-type protein. This lower DNA binding activity could be attributed either to a lower affinity for ATP, an inability to bind ATP (as in the Lys → Ala mutant), or to aberrant ssDNA interactions. Thus, the ability of the mutant protein to bind ATP was tested by UV cross-linking, as was previously done with the wild-type mthMCM enzyme (41Grabowski B. Kelman Z. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, both the wild-type (lane 2) and the zinc finger mutant (lane 3) can bind ATP, unlike the Lys → Ala mutant (lane 4). Comparing the amount of protein and labeled nucleotide in each lane (using densitometer and phosphorimager analyses, respectively) showed that similar amounts of ATP were cross-linked to the wild-type and zinc finger mutant enzymes. Thus, although UV cross-linking is not a quantitative assay, these results suggest comparable binding of ATP to both proteins. Previous studies showed that the ATPase activity of the wild-type protein is stimulated in the presence of ssDNA and, to a lesser extent, by dsDNA (34Kelman Z. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 147"
https://openalex.org/W2052881006,"We have investigated whether by introducing a mutated p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor through a standard type 5 adenovirus (Ad), it would be possible to interfere with restenosis in hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Restenosis is a clinically relevant, undesired effect of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). A critical event underlying restenosis is smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation leading to neointimal formation and vessel reocclusion. Recent data demonstrated that it is possible to reduce restenosis by introducing various genes blocking the cell cycle through Ad vectors. Nonetheless, most experiments were conducted in the healthy carotid artery of rat, which is far from the condition of human disease. Therefore, we investigated whether antiproliferative or proapoptotic genes affect restenosis in a model of atherosclerosis closer to clinical settings. Ad-mutated(m)-p21WAF/CIP1 transgene overexpression induces a significant reduction of restenosis in hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E knockout mice subjected to injury of common carotid artery. This was associated with reduced SMC density and proliferation, macrophage deposition, and oxidation-sensitive mechanisms. Treatment with p21/WAF also enhanced TUNEL positivity of arterial cells. We show that in an experimental model of atherosclerosis, braking the cell proliferation through increased vascular apoptosis and reduced oxidation-sensitive signal transduction and macrophage accumulation can significantly ameliorate the deleterious effects of vascular injuries similar to those that occur during PTCA and related procedures."

Increased expression of IL-18 has been observed in several autoimmune diseases. In this study we have analyzed the role of IL-18 in an antibody-mediated autoimmune disease and elucidated the mechanisms involved in disease suppression mediated by blockade of IL-18, using experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) as a model. EAMG is a T cell-regulated, antibody-mediated autoimmune disease in which the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is the major autoantigen. Th1- and Th2-type responses are both implicated in EAMG development. We show that treatment by anti-IL-18 during ongoing EAMG suppresses disease progression. The protective effect can be adoptively transferred to naive recipients and is mediated by increased levels of the immunosuppressive Th3-type cytokine TGF-beta and decreased AChR-specific Th1-type cellular responses. Suppression of EAMG is accompanied by down-regulation of the costimulatory factor CD40L and up-regulation of CTLA-4, a key negative immunomodulator. Our results suggest that IL-18 blockade may potentially be applied for immunointervention in myasthenia gravis."

The current study examines the effect of NtBHA on mitochondria in old and young rats and human primary fibroblasts (IMR90). In NtBHA-treated rats, the age-dependent decline in food consumption and ambulatory activity was reversed without affecting body weight. The respiratory control ratio of mitochondria from liver of old rats improved after feeding NtBHA. These findings suggest that NtBHA improved mitochondrial function in vivo. The age-dependent increase in proteins with thiol-mixed disulfides was significantly lower in old rats treated with NtBHA. NtBHA was effective only in old rats; no significant effect was observed in young rats. In IMR90 cells, NtBHA delayed senescence-associated changes in mitochondria and cellular senescence induced by maintaining the cells under suboptimal levels of growth factors. Proteasomal activity was also higher in cells treated with NtBHA than in untreated cells. NtBHA accumulates in cells 10- to 15-fold the extracellular concentration and is maintained by mitochondrial NADH. NtBHA is an antioxidant that is recycled by mitochondrial electron transport chain and prevents radical-induced toxicity to mitochondria."

We found that PS1 destabilizes the cytoplasmic and nuclear pools of β-catenin when stabilized by Wnt or Dvl but not when stabilized at lower levels of the Wnt pathway.

More recently Soriano et al. (20Soriano S. Kang D.E. Fu M. Pestell R. Chevallier N. Zheng H. Koo E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) have confirmed their earlier findings (17Kang D.E. Soriano S. Frosch M.P. Collins T. Naruse S. Sisodia S.S. Leibowitz G. Levine F. Koo E.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4229-4237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that PS1wt is a negative regulator of β-catenin stability and that PS1mts are less effective. Their findings are supported by genetic evidence from Drosophila (21Cox R.T. McEwen D.G. Myster D.L. Duronio R.J. Loureiro J. Peifer M.

However, conflicting observations are still being reported, Kirschenbaum et al. (23Kirschenbaum F. Hsu S.C. Cordell B. McCarthy J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7366-7375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) found that both PS1wt and PSmts have no effect on β-catenin stability, while Kawamuraet al. (24Kawamura Y. Kikuchi A. Takada R. Takada S. Sudoh S. Shibamoto S. Yanagisawa K. Komano H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) found that the mutant PS1 M146L increased β-catenin turnover in comparison with wild-type. In an attempt to further clarify the role of PS1 in modulating β-catenin turnover and activity, we have compared wild-type and mutant PS1 effects on β-catenin due to activation of the Wnt pathway at the level of Wnt, Dvl, FRAT, GSK-3, and overexpression of β-catenin itself. We examined the effect of PS1 on β-catenin in three ways, by immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoblotting of subcellular fractions, and in a β-catenin/Tcf-dependent luciferase transcription assay. Our findings suggest a dysjunction between the cellular and signaling competent fraction of β-catenin that is differentially affected by PS1. All cell lines were maintained in 5% (v/v) CO2 in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. HEK293A cells (a subclone of standard HEK293 cells selected for its greater adherence (Quantum Biotechnologies, Canada)) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and CHO cells in F-12 nutrient mix/Ham. Media were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human Dvl1 and Dvl3 cDNAs were generous gifts from Dr. A. Pizzuti and Dr. G. Novelli, respectively. Engineering of Myc-tagged and untagged Dvl1, Dvl2, and Dvl3 expression constructs in pCIneo has been described previously (25Mudher A. Chapman S. Richardson J. Asuni A. Gibb G. Pollard C. Killick R.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4987-4995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.4-kb human PS1wt coding sequence (from the ATG start to the TAG stop site, lacking nucleotides that encode the alternatively spliced VRSQ motif) was amplified by PCR using primers that incorporated anXba I site and a modified Kozak sequence at the 5′ end and anEco RI site at the 3′ end. The amplified product was cloned into pcDNA3(−) (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. PS1 mutants, C263R and P264L, were created from the above clone by extension overlap PCR whereby two overlapping amplified products were generated. The first product was generated using a 5′ primer containing a unique Pflm I site and a 3′ primer containing the nucleotides encoding C263R or P264L. The second product was generated using a 5′ primer containing the nucleotides encoding C263R or P264L and a 3′ primer containing a unique Bsr GI site. The product of amplification of the first two products was then digested withPflmI and BsrGI and subcloned into the same sites of the above PS1wt clone in pcDNA3(−). Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. The PS1 aspartate mutants, D257A and D385A, were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. In brief, oligonucleotide pairs with alanine codons substituting for the aspartate residues Asp257 and Asp385 were synthesized for use as PCR primers. The amplification was performed using TurboPfu polymerase (Stratagene). The resulting product was digested with Dpn I, transformed, and screened by restriction digest. Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. Human c-Myc-tagged Wnt1 (Wnt1-myc) and FLAG-tagged murine FRAT1, both in pcDNA3.1, were kind donations from Dr. Trevor Dale. Wild-type human β-catenin and the mutant, ΔSTβ-catenin, in which the four consensus N-terminal GSK-3β phosphorylation sites (serine and threonine residues 33, 37, 41, and 45) have been substituted by alanine, were generous gifts from Dr. Rolf Kemler. The deletion mutant ΔN89β-catenin, which lacks the GSK-3β phosphorylation sites, was kindly donated by Dr. Paul Polakis. The pTOPflash/pFOPflash luciferase reporter constructs were kind donations from Dr. Hans Clevers. Peptides were synthesized, corresponding to unique regions of each of the three human Dvl isoforms (Dvl1, amino acids 557–571; Dvl2, amino acids 600–614; Dvl3, amino acids 582–596) with the addition of N-terminal cysteine residues to aid conjugation to carrier protein. The peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to raise polyclonal antisera in SPF rabbits. Rabbits received 7 immunizations over a 20-week schedule, and the antisera were purified by salt precipitation. Each antiserum was tested extensively by Western blotting against total cell lysates of HEK293A cells that had been individually transfected with the human recombinant Dvl isoforms to determine their specificity and to ensure that there was no cross-reactivity between isoforms. Peptide blocking was performed and abolition of antibody reactivity (on blots) was achieved with <1 nmol of synthetic peptide/ml of antiserum. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum to β-catenin was raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of full-length β-catenin, and a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to PS1 was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to human PS1 amino acids 1–25 coupled to tuberculin-purified protein derivative. Each rabbit received four immunizations over a 20-week period, and the unpurified sera were used. The resulting antisera recognized full-length β-catenin and the 48-kDa holo-protein and 28-kDa N-terminal cleavage product of PS1, respectively. Cells were plated at the appropriate densities and allowed to attach overnight. DNA was transfected with LipofectAMINE diluted in Optimem (both from Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In multiple transfections the amount of DNA was kept constant by the addition of the appropriate empty vector plasmids. Cells were harvested at set time points after transfection for blotting and the luciferase assay or were fixed for immunofluorescence microscopy 24 h post-transfection in methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. HEK293A cells were transfected as described above. Medium was removed 20 h post-transfection and replaced with fresh medium containing LiCl at the appropriate concentrations (1–25 mm). Cells were allowed to grow for 4 h and then fixed or lysed for subsequent analysis. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells in 10-cm Petri dishes were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and mechanically disrupted with scraping into 0.8 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose) plus Complete mini-protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C. Cell fragments were further disrupted by ten strokes of a Dounce homogenizer followed by five passages through a 27-gauge needle. Cell disruption was confirmed by phase contrast microscopy. The lysate was centrifuged at 600 × g (av) for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant removed and placed on ice. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 600 × g (av) for 10 min at 4 °C, the resultant pellet was the nuclear fraction. The supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g (av) for 1 h at 4 °C in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman TL-100) to produce membrane (pellet) and cytosolic (supernatant) fractions. The fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for β-catenin. Cells grown on glass coverslips in 12-well plates were transfected and fixed as described above. Following fixation the coverslips were incubated at room temperature in blocking/permeablization solution (PBS, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) for 30 min. The coverslips were then incubated with primary antibodies at the appropriate concentration in blocking solution (PBS, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for 1 h. Double immunolabeling was performed using Alexa FluorTM 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate and Alexa FluorTM 488 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Finally coverslips were briefly immersed in 0.5 μg/ml bisbenzimide (Sigma) in PBS, washed, mounted, and visualized using a Zeiss Axioscope. Images were captured using a Pentamax digital camera (Princetown Instruments) and Metamorph imaging software. Protein samples were made up in Laemmli sample buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar), heated at 37 °C for 45 min, and briefly centrifuged. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, at 150 V. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) using a TransBlot semi-dry electroblotter (Bio-Rad) at 15 V for 40 min. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 and 3% (w/v) dried skimmed milk (TBS-T-M) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the relevant primary antibodies diluted to the appropriate concentration in TBS-T-M. After washing blots were incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary immunoglobulins and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). As an assay for the Wnt signal in transfected cells, nuclear translocation of β-catenin was assessed in those cells that also stained positively with antibodies to the transfected proteins. Of the transfected cells identified only those that exhibited strong staining of β-catenin in the nucleus were scored as positive for β-catenin nuclear translocation. β-Catenin antibodies did not stain the nuclei of control cells in untransfected cultures or those cells transfected with an enhanced green fluorescent protein construct, which was employed as a control for nonspecific effects on endogenous β-catenin levels by transfection of plasmid DNA. Cells positively identified as having been transfected with the constructs, but whose nuclei were unstained with the β-catenin antibodies or in which positive staining was questionable, were deemed to have no nuclear translocation of β-catenin and were scored as negative. The quantitative data were averages taken from five independent experiments with a minimum of 200 cell counts in each experimental condition and were expressed as percentages of the appropriate control cultures. Significance levels were determined by logistic regression for grouped data (Wald test) using the STATA software package. The S.D. was calculated from the variation of the data across the five experiments. HEK293A cells were seeded at 1 × 105/well in six-well plates, cultured for 24 h, and transefected with 300 ng of the pTOPflash or pFOPflash luciferase reporter constructs and 500 ng of the Wnt pathway components plus either PS1wt or one of the PS1mts. A constant amount of DNA was maintained by the addition of appropriate empty vector plasmid. Twenty-four hours post-transfection the media was removed and the cells lysed for 5 min in 300 μl of Bright-Glo lysis buffer (Promega). The lysate was removed, vortexed, and briefly spun in a microcentrifuge. 150 μl of lysate supernatant was then combined with 150 μl Bright-Glo luciferase assay reagent (Promega, half-life 30 min) and placed into a 24-well reader plate. Remaining lysate was used to check transfection efficiencies and expression levels by Western blotting. Luciferase activity was immediately measured in a Wallac 1450 Microbeta Trilux luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The data presented are pooled from >4 replica experiments. Statistical significance levels were determined by one way ANOVA. To investigate the effects of PS1 on Wnt signaling, HEK293A cells were transfected with a c-Myc-tagged Wnt1 construct (Wnt1-Myc) or co-transfected with Wnt1-myc and PS1 and stained for endogenous β-catenin, since it has been shown that expression of Wnt1 in HEK293 cells activates T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-dependent gene transcription following translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus (27Sakanaka C. Weiss J.B. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3020-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Standard HEK293 and CHO cells were also transfected to ensure that the results obtained were not restricted to one particular cell type. The results were similar in both cell types, and data are presented only from HEK293A cells. An enhanced green fluorescent protein expression construct was used as a nonspecific control to identify transfected cells. The levels of β-catenin and its cellular distribution were the same in untransfected cells and cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein. Similarly, we observed no changes in β-catenin levels between untransfected cells and control cells when transfected with the relevant empty vector plasmid DNA (data not shown). In contrast to control cells, cells expressing Wnt1-Myc (Fig.1 A) possessed strong nuclear and increased cytoplasmic β-catenin immunoreactivity. Cells that did not express Wnt1-Myc but were in proximity to the Wnt1-Myc-transfected cells also showed evidence of β-catenin stabilization (Fig. 1 B), consistent with Wnt1 being a secreted signaling protein and therefore not limited to an autocrine effect. Since Wnt1-Myc transfection reliably increased levels of nuclear β-catenin, we used this as an assay for Wnt signaling for further experiments. Cells were next transfected with Wnt1-myc alone or doubly transfected with Wnt1-Myc and PS1wt. The cells were labeled with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to PS1 and by a monoclonal antibody recognizing the Wnt1-Myc tag (9E10) and the proportion of total cells (determined by bisbenzimide staining) expressing both calculated. In doubly transfected (Wnt1-Myc and PS1wt) cells β-catenin expression was low and largely cytoplasmic, similar to untransfected cells (Fig. 1, C and D), whereas in cells expressing Wnt1 only β-catenin expression was increased and was nuclear predominant (Fig. 1 B). We next compared the ability of mutant PS1 (two FAD missense mutations, C263R and P264L, a FAD deletion mutation, Δ9, and two mutations that change the putative active site aspartate residues, D257A and D385A) to antagonize Wnt1-induced β-catenin stabilization. All mutants were significantly less effective at attenuating Wnt1-induced β-catenin stabilization than PS1wt (Fig. 1 E, p < 0.01;n = 5), but the three mutants that do not undergo endoproteolytic cleavage (PS1 Δ9 and the artificial aspartate mutants PS1 D287A and PS1 D385A) were the least effective and were not different from control cells indicating a complete loss of function with regard to antagonizing β-catenin nuclear translocation. We then repeated the above transfections in conjunction with a Tcf/luciferase reporter construct as a measure of β-catenin function. Similar results were obtained in that Wnt1 increased β-catenin-dependent transcription, as measured by increased luciferase activity, and this was inhibited by PS1wt. All the PS1 mutants were less effective in this attenuation, and as before, the mutants that do not undergo cleavage showed greater loss of function than the point missense FAD mutations (Fig. 1 F). The pattern of antagonistic effects was very similar to the data obtained by counting the proportion of cells with β-catenin-positive nuclei (compare Fig. 1, E and F). To ensure that equal levels of PS1wt and PS1mt protein were being expressed, samples of the same cell lysate were immunoblotted for PS1 protein. Very similar levels of expression were observed for all PS1 constructs (data not shown). To determine whether PS1 also antagonized Dvl-stabilized β-catenin, we first established if the three human isoforms of Dvl-induced nuclear translocation of β-catenin in HEK293A and CHO cells. When Dvl1, Dvl2, or Dvl3 were overexpressed in either HEK293A or CHO cells, all three isoforms were found in a punctate distribution throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.2, A, C, and E), similar to the staining pattern previously reported for Dvl1 (28Krylova O. Messenger M.J. Salinas P.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Dvl2 (30Smalley M.J. Sara E. Paterson H. Naylor S. Cook D. Jayatilake H. Fryer L.G. Hutchinson L. Fry M.J. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2823-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). When these cells were stained for β-catenin Dvl-expressing cells showed an increase in levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin and nuclear translocation of β-catenin (Fig.2, B, D, and F). The effects of wild-type and mutant forms of PS1 on β-catenin stabilization induced by overexpression of Dvl1, Dvl2, and Dvl3 were investigated using the β-catenin nuclear translocation assay. Co-expression of PSwt with Dvl1 consistently resulted in a marked reduction in β-catenin stabilization, comparable with its effects on the Wnt1-induced stabilization of β-catenin. As for experiments using Wnt1, PS1wt attenuated Dvl-mediated increases in β-catenin activity, but the mutants were less effective than PS1wt (p < 0.01; n = 5 in all cases) (Fig. 2 G). Again, as before, the PS1 Δ9, D287A, and D385A mutants showed complete loss of function, whereas the PS1 C263R and P264L mutants demonstrated partial antagonism of Dvl1. PS1wt similarly antagonized Dvl2- and Dvl3-induced β-catenin nuclear translcoation (Fig. 2 G). These experiments were then repeated using the Luciferase reporter assay with very similar results as seen against Wnt1 stabilzed β-catenin (Fig. 2 H). To confirm these observations biochemically, HEK293A cells and CHO cells were transfected with Dvl1; separated into nuclear, membrane, and cytosolic fractions; and examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 I). Expression of Dvl1 resulted in a marked increase in β-catenin in all three fractions (comparelanes 1 and 3). This increase was attenuated by co-transfection of PS1wt (lane 4), although PS1 by itself had no effect (lane 2). We next examined if PS1 would antagonize β-catenin when stabilization occurred below the level of Dvl. Activation of Dvl recruits FRAT into the axin complex, which stabilizes β-catenin by preventing it from being phosphorylated by GSK-3β (31Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr III, G.H. Sussman D.J.

As expected, cells expressing FRAT1 (Fig. 3 A) showed increased cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for β-catenin (Fig.3 B). HEK293A cells were then doubly transfected with FRAT1 and either PS1wt or PS1 Δ9 and the cells double labeled with antibodies to PS1 and β-catenin. The proportion of cells that exhibited nuclear β-catenin staining did not change when FRAT1 was co-transfected with PS1wt or the PS1 Δ9 mutant (Fig. 3 C). The four other PS1 mutants also had no effect on FRAT1-stabilized β-catenin (data not shown). Despite the apparent lack of effect of PS1 on FRAT1-stabilized β-catenin, we examined whether PS1 would still affect FRAT1-induced increases in β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity. HEK293A cells were transfected with pTOPflash and FRAT1 alone or FRAT1 plus PS1wt or one of the PS1mts. Fig.3 D shows that PS1wt and the PS1mts inhibited FRAT1-induced increases in luciferase activity even though no changes in nuclear translocation were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. Of the PS1 mutants only PS1 Δ9 showed a significant difference in transcriptional inhibition (p"

Analysis of antibody maturation and diversity is difficult to study at the molecular level in humans. We used a combinatorial phage display peptide library to elucidate antibody diversity in HIV-infected individuals to a single immunodominant epitope in gp41. A serum sample derived from an HIV+ individual was used to screen a phage display a 12 mer cysteine-constrained loop peptide library. In doing so, we isolated mimotope-presenting phages corresponding to the immunodominant gp41 epitope CSGKLIC (residues 603-609). The mimotopes and control phages expressing epitope variants were reacted with a panel of 30 HIV+ sera. The patients showed distinct and variable recognition patterns compared with one another. Subfractions of the polyclonal sera were affinity purified and analyzed for epitope specificities. These analyses illustrated that epitope variants can be used to decipher antibody diversity. Elucidation of the plasticity of the humoral response and its polyclonality toward discrete epitopes contributes to our understanding of the antibody maturation process in individuals infected with viruses such as HIV."

Aortic preferentially expressed gene-1 (APEG-1), a VSMC-specific gene, is expressed highly in differentiated but not in dedifferentiated VSMC. Previously, we identified an E-box element in the mouse APEG-1 proximal promoter, which is essential for VSMC reporter activity. In this study, we investigated the role of upstream stimulatory factors (USF) in the regulation of APEG-1 transcription via this E-box element. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays, recombinant USF1 and USF2 homo- and heterodimers bound specifically to the APEG-1 E-box. Nuclear extracts prepared from primary cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle cells exhibited specific USF1 and USF2 binding to the APEG-1 E-box. To investigate the binding properties of USF during VSMC differentiation, nuclear extracts were prepared from the neural crest cell line, MONC-1, which differentiates into VSMC in culture. Maximal USF1 and USF2 protein levels and binding to the APEG-1 E-box occurred 3 h after the differentiation of MONC-1 cells was initiated. Co-transfection experiments demonstrated that dominant negative USF repressed APEG-1 promoter activity, and USF1, but not USF2, transactivated the APEG-1 promoter.

In this report, we wanted to further elucidate the nuclear proteins binding to the APEG-1 E-box and to investigate their role in the regulation of APEG-1 expression. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC), harvested from the thoracic aorta of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic dissociation (17Gunther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, UT), 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Drosophila cells (D.Mel-2; Invitrogen) were cultured in Drosophila SFM at 28 °C. The mouse neural crest cell line MONC-1 was previously provided to our laboratory by Dr. D. Anderson (Pasadena, CA). The culture and differentiation of MONC-1 cells were as described (18Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E. Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Stemple D.L. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

The luciferase reporter plasmids APEG-1 p(−355/+76), p(−122/+76), and p(−122/+76)E-mut were generated by subcloning these fragments into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) as described (6Hsieh C.-M.

The 0.9-kb USF1 cDNA fragment was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse aortic SMC RNA. The 1-kb USF2 cDNA fragment from psvUSF2 was provided by Dr. M. Sawadogo (Houston, TX). The Drosophila expression plasmids, pPAC and phsp82LacZ, were provided by Dr. T. Maniatis (19Thanos P.K. Terzis J.K. J. Reconstr. Microsurg. 1995; 11: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The expression vectors of USF1 and USF2 were constructed by subcloning the USF1 and USF2 inserts into pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) and pPAC. To generate a dominant negative USF expression construct, we amplified a fragment of the USF1 cDNA (encoding amino acids 213–310) by PCR. This fragment was cloned into the pCMV/myc/nuc vector (Invitrogen) that contains a nuclear localization signal and subsequently into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells as described (20Ritzenthaler J.D. Goldstein R.H. Fine A. Lichtler A. Rowe D.W. Smith B.D. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of nuclear extracts were measured by the Bradford dye-binding method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. In vitro translated products were prepared using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega). Two 18-bp oligonucleotide probes, containing the E-box sequence, 5′-GGGCCTCAGCTGGTCAG-3′, or mutated E-box, E-mut 5′-GGGCCTCAGCacGGTCAG-3′, were synthesized according to the mouse APEG-1 exon 1 sequence (6Hsieh C.-M.

USF E-box consensus oligonucleotide was synthesized in the context of the APEG-1 promoter, 5′-GGGCCTCACGTGGTCAG-3′. After annealing, the double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and purified with G-50 spin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The binding reaction contained 20,000 cpm of DNA probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and either 10 μg of nuclear protein orin vitro translated products. In cold competition assays, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides, including APEG-1 E-box, APEG-1 E-mut, and E-box consensus oligonucleotides, were added to the binding reaction 30 min before the addition of radiolabeled probe. For mobility supershift experiments, 2 μg of USF1 (C-20) and USF2 (N-18) rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the binding reactions and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before the addition of radioactive probe. Protein-DNA complex formation was carried out on ice for 30 min and resolved by a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer (44.5 mm Tris-base, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) at 4 °C. Gels were dried, and bands were detected using autoradiographic film. Nuclear proteins (30 μg) were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (22Layne M.D. Endege W.O. Jain M.K. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Chin M.T. Perrella M.A. Blanar M.A. Haber E. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15654-15660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The blot was probed with USF1 or USF2 polyclonal rabbit antibodies. Signal was detected on Western blots using enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico kit; Pierce). Total RNA from cultured cells was extracted using a MINI RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Total RNA (10 μg) was denatured, fractionated on 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gels, and subsequently transferred to NitroPure filters (Osmonics). The filters were then hybridized with random primed, [α-32P]dCTP-labeled APEG-1, USF1, USF2, and SM-α actin cDNA probes. To correct for the differences in RNA loading, blots were subsequently hybridized to a32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to 28 S rRNA. The blots were exposed to a phosphoscreen and x-ray film. The radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager by using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). APEG-1 p(−355/+76), p(−122/+76), and p(−122/+76)E-mut promoter-reporter plasmids were used for transient transfection assays. For assays in RASMC, 2 × 105 cells/well were plated in triplicate in six-well plates, incubated for 24 h. Using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), cells were transfected with 1 μg of the APEG-1 promoter-reporter plasmid plus various amounts of dominant negative USF expression construct and empty vector, pcDNA3, to make the total amount of plasmid DNA to be the same. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity assays. For D.Mel-2 cells, 2 × 105 cells/well were plated in triplicate in 12-well plates, 1 day before transfection. The cells were transfected using CellFECTIN reagent (Invitrogen) and harvested after 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured using Promega's Luciferase Assay System and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. We previously identified an E-box element within exon 1 of the APEG-1 gene (bp +39/+44), which was essential for APEG-1 promoter activity in VSMC (6Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hong A.M. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14344-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We wanted to test the hypothesis that USF proteins, which are capable of binding E-box motifs (CAGCTG) (15Johnson A.D. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1420-C1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may be important for the regulation of APEG-1 in VSMC. To determine whether USF1 or USF2 proteins could bind to the APEG-1 E-box, we performed EMSA using in vitro translated products of USF1 and USF2 incubated with radiolabeled APEG-1 E-box, APEG-1 E-mut, or E-box consensus oligonucleotides as probes. USF1 and USF2 homodimers and USF1/USF2 heterodimers bound to APEG-1 E-box and E-box consensus (CACGTG) probes (Fig. 1, leftand right panels, respectively). USF proteins did not bind to the mutated APEG-1 E-box oligonucleotide (CAGCAC) (Fig. 1,middle panel). The migration of USF1 homodimer is faster than USF2, and the migration of USF1/USF2 heterodimer is intermediate between these two homodimers. To determine whether USF proteins bind to the APEG-1 E-box in VSMC, we prepared nuclear extracts from RASMC. EMSA using APEG-1 E-box (Fig. 2, left panel) and consensus E-box oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 2, right panel) revealed the presence of strong DNA-protein complexes (a and b) when incubated with nuclear extracts from RASMC. There was a faint supershifted band after USF1-specific antibody was added (●), and two supershifted bands after USF2-specific antibody or a combination of USF1/USF2 antibodies were added (*). Moreover, only the intensity of band adecreased with use of USF1 and USF2 antibodies. The specificity of the DNA-protein complex was also assessed by adding an unlabeled E-box competitor in the binding reaction. As shown in theright lane of each gel, bands a and b were competed away by the 100-fold molar excess of E-box cold competitor. Our results indicated that USF1 and USF2 specifically bound to the APEG-1 E-box in RASMC (band a). The MONC-1 neural crest cell line differentiates into smooth muscle cells in culture (18Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E. Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Stemple D.L. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5993-5996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Rao M.S. Anderson D.J. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 722-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We used this model to study USF binding and expression during the differentiation of MONC-1 into smooth muscle cells. We harvested total RNA and nuclear extracts from undifferentiated MONC-1 cells and from cells in differentiation medium for 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 144 h. There were three major DNA-protein complexes detected in MONC-1 cell nuclear extracts (arrows a,b, and c in Fig. 3). EMSA analysis revealed that DNA-binding complexes reached their maximum 3 h after the initiation of MONC-1 cell differentiation (Fig. 3 A). To identify the components of the APEG-1 E-box DNA-protein complexes, we performed supershift assays (Fig. 3 B). Only the acomplex disappeared when USF1- or USF2-specific antibodies were added (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of USF1 antibody, a single supershifted complex (Fig. 3 B, ●) formed. A faint slower migrating complex appeared at 3 h, but this faint complex was also visible in the absence of USF1 antibody (Fig. 3 B,lane 2). The USF1-supershifted complex (●) was not as intense as band a, which disappeared. These data suggest that in addition to a partial supershift, the USF1 antibody caused a disruption in complex a. Two more pronounced supershifted complexes formed in the presence of the USF2 (Fig. 3 B, *) antibody. Again, the slower migrating supershifted complex corresponded in migration speed with a faint complex in the absence of antibody (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). However, the increased intensity in the presence of USF2 antibody suggests that this is a true supershifted complex (Fig. 3 B, upper (*) complex). To investigate the specificity of binding, we added unlabeled competitor (APEG-1 E-box, APEG-1 E-mut, and E-box consensus oligonucleotides) to the binding reactions. Unlabeled APEG-1 E-box oligonucleotide competed away DNA-protein complexes (a, b, and c) (Fig. 3 C). The E-box consensus oligonucleotide mainly competed away complex a, with some diminishment in complexes (b) and (c). In contrast, APEG-1 E-mut competed away only the fastest migrating complex (c). These data suggest that complexesa and b are specific and that complexa contains the USF proteins. In contrast, it is likely that complex c is binding to the flanking sequence outside of the APEG-1 E-box site. We next determined the mRNA and protein levels of USF1 and USF2 during SMC differentiation. By Northern blot analysis, we found there was no significant change in USF1 or USF2 mRNA levels in MONC-1 during differentiation (Fig. 4 A). The levels of APEG-1 and SM α-actin mRNA increased throughout differentiation. Moreover, binding of USF to the APEG-1 promoter (3-h peak) preceded APEG-1 mRNA induction (as early as 6 h) after the initiation of MONC-1 differentiation. By Western blot analysis, we found that the expressions of USF proteins reached their peaks 3 h after the initiation of MONC-1 cell differentiation (Fig. 4 B), which correlated with the peak USF binding activity (Fig. 3 A). RASMC exhibit high levels of endogenous USF binding activity (Fig. 2 and data not shown); thus, we wanted to inhibit USF binding activity to determine its role in regulating the APEG-1 promoter. To perform these experiments, we designed a dominant negative USF expression construct that encodes a protein lacking the basic DNA-binding domain but retains the dimerization domain (24Kiermaier A. Gawn J.M. Desbarats L. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Farrell P.J. Eilers M. Packham G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7200-7211Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, this construct contains a nuclear targeting sequence. We confirmed the nuclear localization of dominant negative USF by immunofluorescent staining of RASMC transfected by this construct (data not shown). Using in vitro translated products, dominant negative USF suppressed the binding of USF1 and USF2 to APEG-1 E-box in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A). Co-transfection of dominant negative USF with the APEG-1 promoter construct in RASMC resulted in a 50% reduction in APEG-1 promoter activity (Fig. 5 B). These results confirm that endogenous USF proteins have a role in the regulation of the APEG-1 promoter. To examine the role of USF1 and USF2 transcription factors in regulating the APEG-1 promoter, we used Drosophila cells (D.Mel-2 cells), which do not contain functional USF (25Moore A.W. Barbel S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10436-10441Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Drosophilacells were transfected with APEG-1 promoter p(−122/+38) reporter construct, USF1 and USF2 expression constructs, and phsp82LacZ to normalize for transfection efficiency. We have previously shown that APEG-1 promoter construct (−122/+38) contains nearly full promoter activity (6Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hong A.M. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14344-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The overexpression of USF1 produced a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity with a maximum of ∼9-fold (Fig. 6). Interestingly, USF2 homodimers and USF1/USF2 heterodimers did not activate the APEG-1 promoter in Drosophila cells (Fig. 6). These data suggest that USF2 is not an activator of the APEG-1 promoter, and when in a heterodimer with USF1, USF2 represses APEG-1 promoter activity. In addition, the USF1 expression construct did not activate the mutated APEG-1 E-box construct, APEG-1 p(−122/+76)E-mut, indicating that USF1 transactivation is through this site. We have demonstrated previously that high levels of APEG-1 gene expression in VSMC require the E-box motif in exon 1 (6Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hong A.M. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14344-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that USF transcription factors bind to this E-box and contribute to the regulation of APEG-1 gene expression, in a positive or a negative manner, depending on the USF family member. USF proteins belong to the group B bHLH transcription factors (26Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar, 27Atchley W.R. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10217-10221Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). They bind preferentially to the CACGTG E-box (28Atchley W.R. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), which is different from the core CAGCTG E-box motif in the APEG-1 gene. The group A bHLH proteins, such as the ubiquitously expressed E2A proteins E12 and E47, recognize and bind as heterodimers to the CAGCTG type of E-box site (28Atchley W.R. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that E2A proteins from RASMC nuclear extracts do not bind to the APEG-1 E-box (6Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hong A.M. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14344-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, recombinant USF (Fig. 1) or USF in RASMC nuclear extracts (Fig. 2) bound to the APEG-1 E-box and regulated APEG-1 promoter activity. These results further support the idea that USF factors can recognize and regulate promoters through this type of E-box site. E-box elements and their associated bHLH transcription factors, such as MyoD, are known to be important in the regulation of striated muscle-specific gene expression and differentiation of striated muscle cells in a tissue-specific manner (29Apone S. Hauschka S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21420-21427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R.

However, no such tissue-restricted bHLH family member has been identified in mature arteries; nor have they been shown to regulate VSMC-expressed genes. While it is not likely that ubiquitously expressed bHLH family members can solely account for expression of VSMC-restricted genes, Johnson and Owens (15Johnson A.D. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1420-C1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that USF factors contribute to the regulation of SM α-actin, a SMC differentiation marker gene. One may hypothesize that a ubiquitously expressed factor, such as USF, heterodimerizes with a smooth muscle-specific factor to promote cell type-restricted gene expression. Alternatively, USF factors may be incorporated into a complex of transcription factors, including co-activators, whose stereospecific assembly allows smooth muscle cell-restricted gene expression. Consistent with this hypothesis, Qyanget al. (12Qyang Y. Luo X. Lu T. Ismail P.M. Krylov D. Vinson C. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) proposed that the ability of USF to activate a given promoter was dependent on cell-specific co-activators. To study the role of USF in the regulation of APEG-1 during the differentiation of VSMC, we used an in vitro MONC-1 differentiation system (18Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E. Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Stemple D.L. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5993-5996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We found that in MONC-1 cells, USF1 and USF2 protein levels and their APEG-1 E-box binding activity peaked very early after differentiation was initiated (Fig. 3). Moreover, expression and binding of USF factors to the APEG-1 E-box preceded expression of the APEG-1 gene (Fig. 4). Therefore, the increased amounts and binding activity of USF proteins may contribute to APEG-1 promoter regulation during VSMC differentiation. These data were supported by functional studies showing that overexpression of a dominant negative USF (that prevents wild-type USF protein binding) decreased APEG-1 promoter activity (Fig. 5). APEG-1, like SM α-actin that is regulated by USF factors, is rapidly down-regulated in injured blood vessels or in dedifferentiated VSMC in culture (5Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.J. Jain M.K. Kashiki S. de los Santos R. Lee W.S. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We now show that USF1 is able to transactivate the APEG-1 promoter; however, USF2 is unable to increase APEG-1 promoter activity (Fig. 6). Even more importantly, co-transfection of an identical amount of USF2 expression plasmid was able to suppress USF1 transactivation of the APEG-1 promoter. These data suggest that USF2 may be acting as a repressor, as described previously in the regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter (31Samoylenko A. Roth U. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Blood. 2001; 97: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that the relative amounts of USF1 and USF2 and the way in which they interact as heterodimers may determine the level of APEG-1 expression. This effect of USF2 on APEG-1 is different from that described for the SM α-actin promoter, in which both USF1 and USF2 caused promoter transactivation (15Johnson A.D. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1420-C1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both studies demonstrate that the USF factors modulate the expression of genes, APEG-1 and SM α-actin, that are acutely regulated by the differentiation status of VSMC. We propose that USF factors, by altering the expression of key genes, may play an important role in the differentiation capability of VSMC."

To gain further insight into the conformational changes that govern transcript cleavage, we have examined the effects of certain anions on the intrinsic transcript cleavage activity ofThermus thermophilus RNA polymerase. Our results indicate that the conformational transitions involved in transcript cleavage, and therefore backtracking, are anion-dependent. In addition to characterizing the intrinsic cleavage activity of T. thermophilus RNA polymerase, we have identified, cloned, and expressed a homolog of the prokaryotic transcript cleavage factor GreA from the extreme thermophiles, T. thermophilus andThermus aquaticus. The thermostable GreA factors contact the 3′-end of RNA, stimulate the intrinsic cleavage activity ofT. thermophilus RNA polymerase, and increase thekapp of the cleavage reaction 25-fold. In addition, we have identified a novel transcription factor in T. thermophilus and T. aquaticus that shares a high degree of sequence similarity with GreA, but has several residues that are not conserved with the N-terminal “basic patch” region of GreA. This protein, Gfh1, functions as an anti-GreA factor in vitro by reducing intrinsic cleavage and competing with GreA for a binding site on the polymerase.

RNA polymerase potassium glutamate dithiothreitol ternary elongation complex RNA polymerase has been shown to possess a surprising activity that serves to release complexes from an arrested state. Specifically, RNA polymerase (RNAP)1appears to be able to catalyze the endo- and exonucleolytic cleavage of the RNA transcript, rapidly releasing the 3′-terminal fragment, which can be as large as 17 nucleotides in length, and resuming synthesis from the 5′-terminal fragment (1Borukhov S. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8899-8902Google Scholar, 2Surratt C.K. Milan S.C. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7983-7987Google Scholar). Two accessory proteins, GreA and GreB, have been found to stimulate this cleavage activity inEscherichia coli (1Borukhov S. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8899-8902Google Scholar, 3Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Google Scholar), and an ortholog of these factors (SII) has been found in eukaryotes (4Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Google Scholar, 5Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8963-8969Google Scholar). Transcript cleavage induced by GreA and GreB reduces abortive initiation (6Hsu L.M. Vo N.V. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Google Scholar) and regulates pausing and arrest during elongation (3Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Google Scholar, 7Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1275-1285Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that transcript cleavage plays an important role in maintaining processive and accurate synthesis of the RNA transcript in vivo. There is strong evidence that this cleavage activity resides on RNA polymerase itself (10Rudd M.D. Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8057-8061Google Scholar, 11Wang D. Hawley D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 843-847Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that the same amino acids that are responsible for nucleotide incorporation may be responsible for this cleavage activity (10Rudd M.D. Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8057-8061Google Scholar, 11Wang D. Hawley D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 843-847Google Scholar). If this hypothesis is true, it would indicate large scale movements of the catalytic site relative to the RNA transcript and the DNA template (12Mustaev A. Kashlev M. Zaychikov E. Grachev M. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19185-19187Google Scholar, 13Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Google Scholar, 14Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Google Scholar). Such conformational changes have been investigated in vitro using stalled complexes formed by NTP deprivation or physical obstruction (15Arndt K.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 79-108Google Scholar, 16Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 221-237Google Scholar, 17Xue Y. Hogan B.P. Erie D.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14356-14362Google Scholar). Studies of these complexes suggest that the formation of a reverse-translocated, or backtracked state, is a necessary step in the transcript cleavage reaction (13Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Google Scholar, 14Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Google Scholar). Backtracking repositions the catalytic site residues of RNAP upstream on the RNA and DNA (13Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Google Scholar, 14Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Google Scholar,16Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 221-237Google Scholar, 18Reeder T.C. Hawley D.K. Cell. 1996; 87: 767-777Google Scholar) while displacing the 3′-end of the RNA transcript from the catalytic site. It has been suggested that the 3′-end of the RNA is extruded through the secondary channel of RNAP in a backtracked complex (8Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Google Scholar, 19Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Google Scholar), which presumably positions the internal phosphodiester bonds of the transcript for hydrolysis by RNAP.For backtracking and transcript cleavage to occur, interactions between RNAP and upstream and downstream DNA need to be altered, as well as single-stranded DNA-RNAP, RNA-RNAP, and DNA-RNA hybrid interactions. Given the number of protein-nucleic acid interactions within the ternary elongation complex, it is likely that the conformational changes associated with backtracking and transcript cleavage may be sensitive to salt concentration (20Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Google Scholar). Different components of the transcription cycle that involve large conformational changes in RNAP and nucleic acid are indeed sensitive to certain electrolytes. For example, RNAP can form an open complex at the λPR promoter in 200 mm potassium glutamate (Kglu), but not in buffer containing 200 mm potassium chloride (KCl) (20Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Google Scholar). Similarly, individual anions within the Hofmeister series can either increase or decrease the rate of elongation and have quantitative effects on pause half-lives (21Chan C.L. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 37-53Google Scholar).In this report, we present the characterization of the intrinsic cleavage activity of Thermus thermophilus RNAP. We find that the intrinsic cleavage activity of the polymerase is significantly influenced by the anion concentration of the transcription buffer. In addition to examining factor-independent transcript cleavage, we have also characterized the effects of two GreA homologs on the cleavage activity of T. thermophilus RNAP. One of the two Gre-like factors is a true homolog of GreA, containing the highly conserved “basic patch” region within its N-terminal region (22Kulish D. Lee J. Lomakin I. Nowicka B. Das A. Darst S. Normet K. Borukhov S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12789-12798Google Scholar), and possessing transcript cleavage properties similar to E. coliGreA. Interestingly, the second Gre-like factor shares a high degree of sequence identity with GreA in its C-terminal region, but several residues within its N-terminal region differ from those in the N-terminal basic patch region of GreA. This factor is only found in a limited set of organisms and appears to function as an anti-GreA factor in vitro. Because of its high degree of sequence similarity but lack of functional homology to GreA, we have named this new factor Gfh1 for Gre FactorHomolog 1.

https://openalex.org/W2162980943,"The type IIs restriction endonucleaseMboII recognizes nonsymmetrical GAAGA sites, cutting 8 (top strand) and 7 (bottom strand) bases to the right. Gel retardation showed that MboII bound specifically to GAAGA sequences, producing two distinct complexes each containing one MboII and one DNA molecule. Interference analysis indicated that the initial species formed, named complex 1, comprised an interaction between the enzyme and the GAAGA target. Complex 2 involved interaction of the protein with both the GAAGA and the cutting sites. Only in the presence of divalent metal ions such as Ca2+ is the conversion of complex 1 to 2 rapid.

Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 1-22Google Scholar, 2Kovall R.A. Matthews B.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 5: 578-583Google Scholar, 3Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 268-269Google Scholar). Generally one protein subunit recognizes one-half of the palindromic sequence and, in an identical arrangement, the second subunit interacts with the other half, resulting in a symmetric protein-DNA complex. Each of the protein subunits contains a catalytic site, enabling both strands of the DNA to be cut, often in a highly concerted reaction. However, many type II restriction endonucleases do not correspond to these simple paradigms. One category, classified as type IIs systems (4Szybalski W. Kaczorowski T. Podajska A.J. Gene. 1991; 100: 13-26Google Scholar), recognizes nonpalindromic DNA sequences, between 4 and 7 base pairs in length and cut up to 20 bases outside their target sites. A nonsymmetrical DNA target site does not allow for simple recognition using a protein with a homodimeric subunit arrangement, and indeed, most type IIs restriction enzymes appear to be monomeric (5Kaczorowski T. Skowron P Podajska A.J. Gene. 1989; 80: 209-216Google Scholar, 6Sektas M. Kaczorowski T. Podajska A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 433-438Google Scholar, 7Tucholski J. Skowron P Podajska A.J. Gene. 1989; 157: 87-92Google Scholar). As a monomeric enzyme will contain only a single active site, there is no straightforward way to achieve the hydrolysis of both DNA strands.FokI, the best studied type IIs enzyme, recognizes GGATG [9/13] sites (the numbers in brackets refer to the distance to the cutting site on the top and bottom strands, respectively) and contains separate DNA recognition and cutting domains (8Li L. Wu L.P. Clarke R. Chandrasegan S. Gene. 1993; 133: 79-84Google Scholar). A crystal structure shows FokI bound to DNA as a monomer with the recognition domain interacting with the GGATG bases; the cutting domain is tightly associated with the recognition domain and too far from the scissile phosphates to cause hydrolysis (9Wah D.A. Hirsch J.A. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1997; 388: 97-100Google Scholar). A second structure, of the free enzyme, shows a dimer in which the dimerization interface is composed of elements of the cutting domains (10Wah D.A. Bitinaite J. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10564-10569Google Scholar). Structural data, together with site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and binding studies (11Bitinaite J. Wah D.A. Aggarwal A.K. Schildkraut I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10570-10575Google Scholar, 12Vanamee E.S. Santagata S. Aggarwal A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 69-78Google Scholar), have led to a model of how FokI cuts DNA (Fig. 1). FokI binds to GGATG sites as a monomer, but this initial complex is not competent for cleavage as the cutting domain is too far from the scissile phosphate. DNA binding releases the cutting domain, allowing dimerization and the assembly of a FokI dimer bound to two GGATG sites (Fig. 1). Cleavage occurs only at one of the GGATG sites, with the presence of two catalytic domains (one associated with the GGATG site being cut and the second “borrowed” from the other GGATG) leading to the hydrolysis of the individual DNA strands at this one site. As cutting does not destroy the GGATG sequence, the enzymes can recycle to cut the second GGATG site. A key feature of the mechanism shown in Fig. 1 is the requirement of two DNA target sites for efficient cutting. Restriction enzymes with this property are surprisingly widespread, constituting several distinct classes. Type IIe endonucleases, such as NaeI (13Colandene J.D. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13703-13707Google Scholar) and EcoRII (14Petrauskene O.V. Babkina O.V. Tashlitsky V.N. Kazankov G.M. Gromova E.S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 425: 29-34Google Scholar), require two sites but only cut at one. One of the DNA targets acts as an allosteric activator, allowing cutting at the second site. Type IIf enzymes, which include SfiI (15Wentzell L.M. Nobbs T.J. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 581-595Google Scholar),SgrAI (16Bilcock D.T. Daniels L.E. Bath A.J. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36379-36386Google Scholar), and Cfr10I (17Siksnys V. Skirgaila R. Sasnauskas G. Urbanke C. Cherny D. Grazulis S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1105-1118Google Scholar), also require two sites but cut both in a concerted manner. These enzymes are tetrameric and so contain four active sites, sufficient for the cutting of the four scissile phosphodiester bonds that occur at two double-stranded target sites. A simple method for assessing the requirement for two sites is to use plasmids containing either one or two copies of the target (16Bilcock D.T. Daniels L.E. Bath A.J. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36379-36386Google Scholar, 18Gormley N.A. Bath A.J. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6928-6936Google Scholar, 19Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (n press): iGoogle Scholar). Orthodox type II enzymes such as EcoRI,EcoRV, BamHI, and PvuII handle both plasmids equally well, as they do not need two sites. However, endonucleases in the sub-classes IIe and IIf show very low activity with plasmids containing only a single target site, confirming a requirement for two copies of their recognition sequence. The plasmid approach has recently been applied to a number of type IIs restriction endonucleases including FokI (19Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (n press): iGoogle Scholar). Despite the enzymes being classified into the same IIs category, a wide variation in properties was observed. Some (BsaI, BsmBI, BsmI, and SapI) behaved like simple type II endonucleases, cutting one- and two-site plasmids with equal facility. Others (BsgI, BpmI, FokI, andBspMI) clearly required two sites, but even the behavior of this group could be further subdivided. With BsgI andBpmI the two target sites were cut in a sequential manner at about the same rate. FokI was slightly different; sequential cutting of the two sites was observed, but the first was cut more rapid than the second. These three enzymes are similar to type IIe systems, where, although two target sites are required, only one is cut in a single round of activity. BspMI showed concerted cleavage of all four DNA strands in the two target sites, reminiscent of type IIf enzymes. Thus, type IIs enzymes may be mechanistically diverse. To further elucidate the type IIs systems, this article reports on binding and kinetic studies with MboII. This endonuclease has the recognition site GAAGA [8/7] (20Brown N.L. Hutchinson III, C.A. Smith M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 140: 143-148Google Scholar) and has been cloned fromMoraxella bovis (21Bocklage H. Heeger K. Müller-Hill B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1007-1013Google Scholar). A purification scheme has been described, and the free enzyme was found to be monomeric (6Sektas M. Kaczorowski T. Podajska A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 433-438Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the enzyme forms a specific complex (KD = 0.34 nm) with its recognition site with a DNase I footprint from just before the GAAGA sequence to just after the cutting site. This complex contains a monomer ofMboII bound to the GAAGA target (22Sektas M. Kaczorowski T. Podajska A.J Gene. 1995; 157: 181-185Google Scholar). The MboII restriction endonuclease was purified from Escherichia coli MS100. This strain was derived from ER2538 (F−E. coli B fhuA2 [lon] [dcm] ompT gal sulA11 Δ(mcrC-mrr) 114::IS10 R(mcr-73::miniTn10; Tets)2 endA1 R(zgb210::Tn10; Tets) (DE3)) by the addition of three plasmids: pLysS (chloramphenicol resistance), pSYX20MboIIM (a plasmid that constitutively expresses both MboII methyltransferases and confers kanamycin resistance), and pSYX22MboIIR (a plasmid that has the MboII restriction endonuclease under the control of an inducible T7 (23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar, 24Dubendorff J.W. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 45-59Google Scholar, 25Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Google Scholar) promoter and confers ampicillin resistance). Constitutive expression of the methylases protects the cell from any premature endonuclease synthesis. Cells were plated out on Luria-Bertani agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Material derived from a single colony was transferred to 2 × 10 ml of Luria-Bertani broth (containing the same antibiotics) and grown at 37 °C for 6 h. These cultures were diluted into 2 × 50 ml of Luria-Bertani broth/antibiotics and grown at 37 °C overnight. Approximately 15 ml of the overnight cultures were transferred to 6 × 500 ml of Luria-Bertani broth/antibiotics and grown until an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6 was achieved. Expression of the endonuclease was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, followed by 4 h of further incubation at 37 °C. The cells (∼1 g/500 ml of culture) were collected by centrifugation and stored frozen at −20 °C until needed. Enzyme purification was carried out using a buffer comprising 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% (v/v) glycerol supplemented with either 0.2m NaCl (low salt buffer) or 1 m NaCl (high salt buffer). All steps were carried out on ice or at cold room temperature. The purification was monitored using SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining and digestion of unmethylated phage λ DNA. About 6 g ofE. coli ER2538 cell paste was suspended in 50 ml of low salt buffer, and the cells were lysed by sonication. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a 20 × 3 cm phosphocellulose column (phosphocellulose P11, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with low salt buffer. The column was washed, at 1.0 ml/min, with 500 ml of low salt buffer and developed with a gradient composed of 250 ml each of low and high salt buffer. Fractions containing MboII (which eluted just before halfway through the gradient) were pooled. (NH4)2SO4 was added to 50% (w/v), and any precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation and discarded. The remaining supernatant was made 80% (w/v) in (NH4)2SO4, and the precipitatedMboII endonuclease was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was dissolved in a minimal volume of low salt buffer, and final purification was achieved by fast protein liquid chromatography-based gel filtration using a 30 × 1-cm Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) run in low salt buffer. Fractions that contained pure MboII were pooled, made up to 30% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Typically 1–2 mg of protein was obtained. SDS-PAGE stained with either Coomassie Blue or silver showed only one band at the expected molecular mass of 49 kDa. The concentration of MboII endonuclease was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 4.047 × 104m−1 cm−1(26Stoschek C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-69Google Scholar). The plasmid pUC18 is reported to contain 7 MboII sites at positions 291, 685, 1456, 1547, 2302, 2380, and 2489 (27Yanisch-Peron C. Viera J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Google Scholar) (there is no easily available plasmid with a smaller number of sites). During the course of this work, it was discovered that the pUC18 we used contained an additional MboII site at position 1304 (this is the result of a single base change; G at position 1308 to A, converting a GAAGG sequence to GAAGA; it is not clear whether the original pUC sequence contained an error or the plasmid used in this study has picked up a subsequent mutation). Two derivatives were prepared that contained a single MboII site at position 2302 (pMS1) and two MboII sites at positions 685 and 2302 (pMS2). Superfluous MboII sites were removed one at a time by back-to-back PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). The PCR protocol amplified a fragment of pUC18 that contained the mutatedMboII site flanked by two unique restriction endonuclease sites. In a subsequent step, the original plasmid was cut using the two restriction endonucleases, allowing the removal of the MboII site. The PCR fragment was inserted at this site, resulting in the addition of the mutated MboII site. E. coli XL-1 blue was used for these manipulations, and in each case the success of the operation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A single base substitution was made within each GAAGA recognition sequence (changes were selected so as not to change amino acids in coding regions) resulting in GGAGA (position 291), GAGGA (position 685), GAAGG (position 1304), GAAGG (position 1456), GAAAA (position 1547), GAGGA (position 2380), and GAAAA (position 2489). The immediate environment of the MboII site at position 2302 (present in both pMS1 and pMS2) is GCCCCCGAAGAACGTTTTCCAATGATGAGCACT. With the site at position 685 (present in only pMS2), the corresponding sequence is GAAGCGGAAGAGCGCCCAATACGCAAACCGCC. Thus, although pMS2 contains two GAAGA MboII sites, the bases flanking and between the recognition and cutting sites vary. Therefore, a third plasmid was prepared by insertion of the oligodeoxynucleotide GCCCCGAAGAACGTTTTCCAATGATGATGAGCACT into the uniqueSmaI restriction endonuclease site (position 412) of pMS1. This plasmid contains two MboII sites, one at the originalSmaI site and the second at position 2302 with identical sequences flanking both the GAAGA and cutting sites. DNA sequencing confirmed the success of the insertion and revealed two variants, pMS3a and pMS3b, which had the two MboII sites in a head-to-head and head-to-tail arrangement, respectively. The plasmids pMS1, -2, and -3 were isolated from 100 ml of E. coli XL-1 blue grown to an absorbance (600 nm) of about 0.6 in Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Purification used a Midiprep kit (Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of the purified plasmids was determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual Appendix C.1.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Most of the studies with MboII were done using a double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide prepared by hybridizing GCCATTGCGGTAACGTAACTTGCGTCTTCAAGTTGGAGCCTAGC (44-mer) with TTTTTGCTAGGCTCCAACTTGAAGACGCAAGTTACGTTACCGCAATGGC (49-mer) (both strands written in the 5′ → 3′ direction; theMboII recognition site and two bases flanking the cutting site shown in bold). These oligodeoxynucleotides are complementary apart from a short 5′ extension in the 49-mer, and duplexes (44/49-mer) were produced by mixing equimolar amounts of the single strands in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, heating to 95 °C, and cooling slowly to room temperature. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis showed >95% duplex formation. A control had the GAAGA element in the 49-mer strand replaced by AGAAG, with a complementary change in the 44-mer strand. For dimethyl sulfate interference, a variant of the 44/49-mer having the T at position 33 of the 49-mer strand replaced by dG (with a corresponding change in the 44-mer) was used. Some experiments were also carried out with a 25/28-mer duplex produced from TTCCGGAAGACTGTTACGTTACCGC (25-mer) and CGAGCGGTAACGTAACAGTCTTCCGGAA (28-mer). For gel shift analysis, one strand in the duplex was radiolabeled with a 5′-[32P]phosphate (polynucleotide kinase and γ-[32P]ATP). The duplex oligodeoxynucleotide (20 pm) was incubated with increasing amounts ofMboII (from 10 pm to 0.45 nm) in 20 μl of 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin (MboII analysis buffer). Incubation was for 45 min at 37 °C (occasionally, as mentioned under “Results,” the incubation time and temperatures were varied), and analysis used a 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel made up and run in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA. Gels (18 × 16 × 0.3 cm) were pre-run at 30 W1 for 1 h with cooling. The samples (to which had been added 3 μl of 40% (w/v) sucrose) were loaded and the gels run for 90 min at 30 W with cooling. The progress of the gel was monitored using the dyes bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol FF in spare lanes. The counts in each band were detected using a phosphorimaging device (Fuji BAS-1500). Data were fitted using the Scientist software program (30MicroMath Scientific Software (1995) Scientist, Version 2, Salt Lake City, UTGoogle Scholar) as outlined under “Results.” For gel retardation analysis, using a mixture of the 44/49-mer and a 200-mer, the long oligodeoxynucleotide was prepared by PCR of pMS1. Primers were selected to amplify a fragment 200 bases in length containing a centrally located GAAGA sequence (this fragment was labeled at its 5′ terminus with [32P]phosphate using polynucleotide kinase and γ-[32P]ATP). Incubation mixtures contained ∼50 pm levels of both the 44/49-mer and the 200-mer together with 0.7 nmMboII. An 8% polyacrylamide gel was found to work best in this case. For gel retardation analysis in the presence of Ca2+, the 44/49-mer and MboII (amounts given under “Results”) were mixed in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 6 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. After incubation for the times and at the temperatures given under “Results,” gel shift analysis was carried out using either a 12 or 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel made up using 89 mm Tris borate, pH 7.5, and run in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 7.5, containing 5 mmCaCl2 (the inclusion of CaCl2 in the buffer to make up the gel gave very poor results with badly smeared bands). Oligodeoxynucleotide hydrolysis was carried out in 200-μl volumes ofMboII analysis buffer (lacking EDTA and containing 10 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. The concentration of oligodeoxynucleotide (labeled in both strands with 5′-[32P]) was 0.24 nm. The different lengths of the two substrate strands and the two labeled product strands allowed the cutting of both strands in the duplex to be individually monitored. The reaction was initiated by adding MboII endonuclease to a final concentration of 4 nm. 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn at the times given under “Results” and mixed with 5 μl of “stop” solution (89 mm Tris borate, pH 8, containing 2.5 m urea, 0.1 mEDTA, 10% (w/v) sucrose and 125 μg/ml each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol FF) to quench the reaction. Analysis was by denaturing gel electrophoresis (16% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 murea and run in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8, containing 1 mm EDTA). Gels (18 × 16 × 0.3 cm) were run at 30 W for 90 min (progress monitored using the dyes), and band intensities were determined by phosphorimaging as described above. Data were fitted to smooth curves (see “Results”) to obtain the half-lives of reactions. Methylation interference, using dimethyl sulfate, was based on standard protocols (31Shaw P.E. Stewart A.F. Moss T. DNA-Protein Interactions, Principles and Protocols. 2nd Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 221-227Google Scholar). Only the variant duplex 44/49-mer was used, and two parallel experiments were carried out; one with only the 44-mer labeled and the other with only the 49-mer labeled (in both cases 5′-[32P] labeling was used). The oligodeoxynucleotide duplex, in 40 μl of 10 mm Hepes-NaOH containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, was incubated with 5 μl of a dimethyl sulfate solution (5% v/v in ethanol). Four such reactions were processed simultaneously. After 12–15 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 1 m2-mercaptoethanol and 10 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution of tRNA (from bakers' yeast, Sigma). The DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation as described (31Shaw P.E. Stewart A.F. Moss T. DNA-Protein Interactions, Principles and Protocols. 2nd Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 221-227Google Scholar) and dissolved in 10 μl of MboII analysis buffer. To each of the four solutions obtained was addedMboII restriction endonuclease to give a final concentration of 100 nm. After a 45-min incubation at 37 °C, the free and protein-associated DNA bands were separated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis as described above. Bands were visualized by phosphorimaging and the appropriate gel slices cut out. Oligodeoxynucleotides were extracted from the gel (the four extracts corresponding to the same band were pooled at this stage), cleaved with piperidine, and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis as described (31Shaw P.E. Stewart A.F. Moss T. DNA-Protein Interactions, Principles and Protocols. 2nd Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 221-227Google Scholar). Plasmid hydrolysis was carried out in 300-μl volumes ofMboII analysis buffer (lacking EDTA and containing 10 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. Reactions were carried out with either an excess of enzyme (80 nm plasmid, 2 μm enzyme) or an excess of DNA (90 nmplasmid, 8 nm enzyme). In all cases the reaction was initiated by enzyme addition, and 20-μl aliquots were removed (times given under “Results”) and added to 10 μl of stop mix (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1 m EDTA, 10% (w/v) sucrose and 125 μg/ml bromphenol blue). The samples were analyzed using a 1% agarose gel, run in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Gels were 14 × 11 × 0.5 cm and run at 120 W for 90–120 min. The bands were visualized using a Gel Documentation System 1000 (Bio-Rad ), and the intensity of each band was determined using Bio-Rad Molecular AnalystTM software. The bands produced with pMS1, pMS2, and pMS3 were supercoiled (SC; starting substrate), open circle (OC; resulting from nicking of one strand), and full-length linear (FLL; resulting from cutting of both strands at oneMboII site). All had a size of 2686 base pairs, but the supercoiled ran with an apparent size of 1700 base pairs and the open circle with an apparent size of >3000 base pairs (32Halford S.E. Taylor J.D. Vermote C.L.M Vipond I.B. Kneale G.G. DNA-Protein Interactions, Principles and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1994: 385-396Google Scholar). With pMS2 two product bands, resulting from cleavage at both MboII sites, of 1617 and 1069 base pairs were produced. With pMS3 these bands were 1842 and 844 base pairs. A correction factor was applied to the measured intensity to account for differential ethidium bromide binding. This factor was 0.7 for supercoiled DNA and 1 (i.e.no correction) for open circle and full-length linear forms (33McLure W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Google Scholar). Intensity corresponding to products arising from cutting at twoMboII sites were corrected for the fractional length of the product. Plasmid hydrolysis was also carried out with pMS1 (under conditions in which enzyme was in excess) in the presence of an oligodeoxynucleotide containing a single MboII site. Conditions were as described above, but the 44/49-mer was added to a final concentration of 400 nm. Gel retardation analysis was carried out using MboII and oligodeoxynucleotides. Initially all experiments were carried out in the presence of EDTA and lacked divalent metals such as Mg2+ or Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 2A, for the 44/49-mer, two shifted bands were seen using a 15% gel. The same pattern was found with the 25/28-mer (not shown). The results shown in Fig. 2A were obtained after incubation at 37 °C for 45 min. The band with the lower mobility (labeled Complex 1) was produced essentially instantaneously (i.e.mixing MboII and oligodeoxynucleotide followed by loading onto the gel as quickly as possible). However, the production of slightly faster running band (labeled Complex 2) was both time- and temperature-dependent. At 37 °C, 45 min was required for the maximal appearance of complex 2, with much less of this species being produced at shorter times (Fig. 3A). Between 20 and 32 °C hardly any of complex 2 was formed, even after 1 h of incubation (not shown); this suggests that MboII binding to DNA initially results in complex 1, which then slowly converts to complex 2. To investigate the nature of complexes 1 and 2, interference analysis with dimethyl sulfate has been carried out using a slightly modified version of the 44/49-mer. This contained GA rather than TA at the cutting site on the 49-mer strand, to provide a dimethyl sulfate target at this location. The modified oligodeoxynucleotide behaved in an identical manner to its parent in gel shift and cutting assays (not shown). With the radioactive label present in the 49-mer strand of the duplex, Fig. 2B shows that both complex 1 and complex 2 exhibit very clear interference at the GAAGA recognition site (Footprinted region 1). Dimethyl sulfate reacts with the N7 of dG (major groove location) and N3 of dA (minor groove location) to give N-methylated bases. Most restriction endonucleases make direct contacts through the major groove with the bases that constitute their recognition site (1Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 1-22Google Scholar, 2Kovall R.A. Matthews B.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 5: 578-583Google Scholar, 3Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 268-269Google Scholar). The strong interference seen with the two dG bases in the GAAGA sequence probably arises directly from the disruption of such contacts. With the three dA bases, disruption of direct protein-DNA contacts, made via the minor groove, may account for the interference. A more likely explanation is that methylation of these dA bases alters their position within the double helix and therefore, indirectly, perturbs protein-DNA interaction. Fig.2B also illustrates that complex 2 shows additional interference bands (Footprinted region 2) near the cutting site, which are absent from complex 1. Cutting on this strand takes place between G33 and A34. Methylation of G33 itself does not interfere with binding, and the data with A34 are inconclusive. However, bands corresponding to G36 and A39 are clearly absent in the complex 2 ladder, and therefore modification of bases 3′ to the cutting site prevents formation of this complex. MboII has no selectivity for bases at this site; interference must arise from indirect effects,e.g. base modification changing the overall DNA conformation. Experiments with the 44-mer strand showed very weak interference patterns, probably because of the lack of dG and dA bases (the target for dimethyl sulfate) at critical positions.Figure 3Influence of Ca2+ on oligonucleotide binding by MboII.

https://openalex.org/W1506343582,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein is a structural protein that packages the viral genomic RNA. In this study, we demonstrate that a stable core protein dimer could be produced in liver cells. The production of this protein could be enhanced by calphostin C and serum deprivation. This protein was determined to be the core protein dimer because of its reactivity with the anti-core antibody, its similar electrophoretic mobility compared with that of the core protein dimer generated by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde, and its increase in size by a hemagglutinin tag fused to the core protein sequence. This core protein dimer was highly stable and resistant to SDS and beta-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme that mediated the formation of this stable core protein dimer was determined to be the tissue transglutaminase (tTG) because, first, tTG could be activated by calphostin C and serum deprivation; second, the formation of this dimer was suppressed by monodansylcadaverine, a tTG inhibitor; and third, the core protein could be cross-linked by tTG in vitro. Thus, the HCV core protein represents the first known viral structural protein substrate of tTG. The post-translational modification by tTG reduced the RNA binding activity of the core protein, raising the possibility that tTG may regulate the biological functions of the HCV core protein."

https://openalex.org/W2081940883,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins were originally identified as prominent acute-phase serum proteins synthesized predominantly by hepatocytes. These small proteins are remarkably lipophilic, and we have sought evidence for their synthesis in mouse brain. RT-PCR showed constitutive expression of the murine SAA1 gene in the brains of normal BALB/cJ mice. After intracerebral inoculation with Sindbis virus, these mice predictably increase brain expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), and IL-6. However, brain SAA1 expression fell after injecting either virus or control saline and remained low despite increases in TNF-alpha and IL-6, which are known to induce its expression in hepatocytes. Our data thus show that expression of the murine SAA1 gene has different, unprecedented control in mouse brain, suggesting that the protein itself may have a different physiological role there."
