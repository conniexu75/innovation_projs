https://openalex.org/W1995768656,"Following intravenous infusion of tritiated norepinephrine, rat pineals were prepared for combined autoradiography and electron microscopy. Concentrations of photographic grains were observed only over regions of preterminal autonomic axons containing granulated vesicles, thereby directly demonstrating uptake of norepinephrine into these axons and strongly suggesting that their granulated vesicles contain norepinephrine."

https://openalex.org/W2036759076,Daily injection of microgram amounts of melatonin in rats decreased the incidence of estrus and reduced ovarian weight. Circulating melatonin was selectively taken up and retained by the ovary and pineal gland; this effect was reduced by exposure of rats to constant light. A single injection of melatonin lowered the incidence of estrus among rats exposed to constant light.
https://openalex.org/W1988086638,"The form of the average evoked response to clicks is highly correlated with the background electroencephalogram. However, the response during the emergent low-voltage ""dreaming"" stage is different from that seen during the low-voltage phase at the beginning of sleep. The results provide additional evidence that the emergent low-voltage stage is a neurophysiologically unique phase."

https://openalex.org/W1993028307,"Examination of 150 to 200 samples of the ependymal lining of the ventricles of nine adult human brains obtained 2½ to 6 hours post-mortem revealed cilia in at least 20 separate sites in the four ventricular cavities. In seven of the brains ciliary motion was evident, and in two of these it was widespread and rapid. It seems likely that the adult human ventricular ependyma is ciliated throughout. Currents having distinct patterns are induced in the ventricles of animal brains by ciliary motion, and such currents probably exist in man. A local mechanism for the rapid movement of cerebrospinal fluid is therefore present."

https://openalex.org/W1569816193,"In presenting the neuropathology of asphyxia neonatorum and some related conditions, as illustrated in experiments with monkeys (12), I have tried to make six principal points. (i) Newborn monkeys need not be asphyxiated to the point of terminal apnea to suffer structural brain damage. Mental retardation has not been proved, but neither has it been excluded, in these monkeys. (ii) Asphyxia neonatorum requiring resuscitation of the offspring, which otherwise would die, is associated with a remarkably constant syndrome of bilaterally symmetrical, nonhemorrhagic lesions in thalamic and brain-stem nuclei, mainly those of afferent systems. The individuals in this category clearly are retarded. (iii) Asphyxia neonatorum of this second degree may be associated with postpartum complications leading to neocortical atrophy, often of considerable magnitude. The individuals are markedly retarded, often palsied, epileptic, and in a few instances even comatose. (iv) Increased intrauterine pressure in the monkey during prolonged labor leads to fetal and postpartum depression, in connection with which cerebral cortical injury occurs in the absence of typical asphyxial lesions. (v) The relationship of cerebral hemorrhages to mental retardation is not clear, but their presence at autopsy probably signifies trauma during birth, or is an agonal artifact associated with death after postpartum depression. (vi) Finally, kernicterus, a condition in which bile pigment escapes into the brain tissues from the blood when the bilirubin level is high and when there is, in combination with it, some depressing factor such as asphyxia, has been produced in the newborn monkey. It, too, is associated with mental retardation."

https://openalex.org/W2050785846,"A METHOD for the microdetermination of acetylcholinesterase activity has been developed in which the formation of acetic acid labelled with carbon-14, liberated enzymically from the labelled substrate, is measured by a simple counting technique. The method has the advantage that it can be applied to very small samples of tissue at relatively constant pH. It has been applied successfully to samples of the order of 1 µl. of whole blood, blood plasma, or insect tissue deposited on cavity-type microscope slides. Since dilution of the sample is unnecessary or readily limited without affecting sensitivity, the technique provides a more reliable indicator of reversible cholinesterase inhibition by compounds such as carbamates than the conventional Michel method1, for example."

https://openalex.org/W2038091321,"The nonparticulate fraction of homogenates of heart, liver, kidney, lung, and cerebral cortex from human fetuses of varying gestational ages was subjected to electrophoresis on starch grains. Five lactic dehydrogenases and two malic dehydrogenases with characteristic rates with pyridine nucleotide analogs were found in all tissues at all ages. Quantitative differences in the relative proportions of these peaks were observed as gestation proceeded."

https://openalex.org/W2079208693,"Axenic, or germ-free, mice are more resistant to the delayed lethal effect of nitrogen mustard than normal mice. The resistance is most striking when mustard is administered at pH 2.0. The finding supports the hypothesis that intestinal bacteria play an important role in the systemic toxicity of nitrogen mustard."

Ligation of the renal blood vessels for a period of 6 to 24 hours destroys most of this phosphorescence, whereas a ligation of the ureter has no effect on kidney phosphorescence."
