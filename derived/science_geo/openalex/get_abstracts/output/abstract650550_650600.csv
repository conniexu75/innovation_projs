https://openalex.org/W3015608194,"A new coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the aetiological agent responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. Currently, there are no targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease, and effective treatment options remain very limited. Here we describe the results of a programme that aimed to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, by combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening. This programme focused on identifying drug leads that target main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2: Mpro is a key enzyme of coronaviruses and has a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for SARS-CoV-25,6. We identified a mechanism-based inhibitor (N3) by computer-aided drug design, and then determined the crystal structure of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with this compound. Through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed more than 10,000 compounds-including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials and other pharmacologically active compounds-as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these compounds inhibited Mpro, showing half-maximal inhibitory concentration values that ranged from 0.67 to 21.4 μM. One of these compounds (ebselen) also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no specific drugs or vaccines are available."

From the assembly of the genome of Thinopyrum elongatum , a wild relative of wheat used in breeding programs to improve cultivated wheat, Wang et al. cloned a gene that can address both problems (see the Perspective by Wulff and Jones). The encoded glutathione S -transferase detoxifies the trichothecene toxin and, when expressed in wheat, confers resistance to FHB. Science , this issue p. eaba5435 ; see also p. 822"
https://openalex.org/W3015411398,"Summary Conversion of glial cells into functional neurons represents a potential therapeutic approach for replenishing neuronal loss associated with neurodegenerative diseases and brain injury. Previous attempts in this area using expression of transcription factors were hindered by the low conversion efficiency and failure of generating desired neuronal types in vivo. Here, we report that downregulation of a single RNA-binding protein, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (Ptbp1), using in vivo viral delivery of a recently developed RNA-targeting CRISPR system CasRx, resulted in the conversion of Muller glia into retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with a high efficiency, leading to the alleviation of disease symptoms associated with RGC loss. Furthermore, this approach also induced neurons with dopaminergic features in the striatum and alleviated motor defects in a Parkinson’s disease mouse model. Thus, glia-to-neuron conversion by CasRx-mediated Ptbp1 knockdown represents a promising in vivo genetic approach for treating a variety of disorders due to neuronal loss."
https://openalex.org/W3100378492,"Two-dimensional systems can host exotic particles called anyons whose quantum statistics are neither bosonic nor fermionic. For example, the elementary excitations of the fractional quantum Hall effect at filling factor $\nu=1/m$ (where m is an odd integer) have been predicted to obey abelian fractional statistics, with a phase $\varphi$ associated with the exchange of two particles equal to $\pi/m$. However, despite numerous experimental attempts, clear signatures of fractional statistics remain elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate abelian fractional statistics at filling factor $\nu=1/3$ by measuring the current correlations resulting from the collision between anyons at a beam-splitter. By analyzing their dependence on the anyon current impinging on the splitter and comparing with recent theoretical models, we extract $\varphi=\pi/3$, in agreement with predictions."

Jiang et al. controlled the self-assembly of gold–cysteine nanoplatelets into a variety of chiral, hierarchically organized colloidal particles by changing the chiral fraction of cysteine and the nucleation temperature. Organic cations created electrostatic repulsions that favored edge assembly of the nanoplatelets, which in turn could create surfaces bearing twisted spikes. Science , this issue p. 642"
https://openalex.org/W2994616144,"A spin-pumping antiferromagnet Antiferromagnets have been used in spintronics mainly as a source of the so-called exchange bias. However, they hold promise for a much more active role given that their magnetization dynamics can in principle be much faster than those in ferromagnets. For this promise to materialize, antiferromagnets must learn the tricks that come naturally to ferromagnets. Vaidya et al. observed one such phenomenon called spin pumping (see the Perspective by Hoffmann). The researchers irradiated the antiferromagnet MnF 2 with circularly polarized subterahertz light, causing the spins in this material to spring into action. These dynamics, in turn, caused the injection of spin current into a layer of platinum adjacent to MnF 2 . Science , this issue p. 160 ; see also p. 135"
https://openalex.org/W3098698304,"The emergence of quasiparticles in strongly interacting matter represents one of the cornerstones of modern physics. However, when different phases of matter compete near a quantum critical point, the very existence of quasiparticles comes under question. Here we create Bose polarons near quantum criticality by immersing atomic impurities in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with near-resonant interactions. Using locally-resolved radiofrequency spectroscopy, we probe the energy, spectral width, and short-range correlations of the impurities as a function of temperature. Far below the superfluid critical temperature, the impurities form well-defined quasiparticles. However, their inverse lifetime, given by their spectral width, is observed to increase linearly with temperature at the Planckian scale $\frac{k_B T}{\hbar}$, a hallmark of quantum critical behavior. Close to the BEC critical temperature, the spectral width exceeds the binding energy of the impurities, signaling a breakdown of the quasiparticle picture."
https://openalex.org/W3016060766,"Vulnerability to relapse during periods of attempted abstinence from cocaine use is hypothesized to result from the rewiring of brain reward circuitries, particularly ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons. How cocaine exposures act on midbrain dopamine neurons to precipitate addiction-relevant changes in gene expression is unclear. We found that histone H3 glutamine 5 dopaminylation (H3Q5dop) plays a critical role in cocaine-induced transcriptional plasticity in the midbrain. Rats undergoing withdrawal from cocaine showed an accumulation of H3Q5dop in the VTA. By reducing H3Q5dop in the VTA during withdrawal, we reversed cocaine-mediated gene expression changes, attenuated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, and reduced cocaine-seeking behavior. These findings establish a neurotransmission-independent role for nuclear dopamine in relapse-related transcriptional plasticity in the VTA."
https://openalex.org/W3015450382,"Summary Many cytosolic proteins lacking a signal peptide, called leaderless cargoes, are secreted through unconventional secretion. Vesicle trafficking is a major pathway involved. It is unclear how leaderless cargoes enter into the vesicle. Here, we find a translocation pathway regulating vesicle entry and secretion of leaderless cargoes. We identify TMED10 as a protein channel for the vesicle entry and secretion of many leaderless cargoes. The interaction of TMED10 C-terminal region with a motif in the cargo accounts for the selective release of the cargoes. In an in vitro reconstitution assay, TMED10 directly mediates the membrane translocation of leaderless cargoes into the liposome, which is dependent on protein unfolding and enhanced by HSP90s. In the cell, TMED10 localizes on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment and directs the entry of cargoes into this compartment. Furthermore, cargo induces the formation of TMED10 homo-oligomers which may act as a protein channel for cargo translocation."
https://openalex.org/W3015624413,"The perception of complex scents It is generally assumed that olfactory receptors faithfully report information to the brain in the form of a linear, additive code. However, under realistic conditions, the olfactory system handles a far more complex input, usually mixtures of odors. Xu et al. found that when we smell scents, the nasal olfactory sensory neurons relay a more complex pattern of signals to the brain than previously thought. The responses of individual neurons within the peripheral olfactory epithelium were either amplified or attenuated by the presence of other odors, which could explain the common perception of one odor in a mixture dominating over others. This effect occurs within the peripheral sensory organ's receptors and not within the brain. Science , this issue p. eaaz5390"
https://openalex.org/W3016025149,"Forest dynamics and demography Tropical forest succession has been viewed mostly by considering trees in categories of early-, mid-, and late-successional species, corresponding to a fast–slow continuum of life history strategies. Rüger et al. now show that the fast–slow continuum does not capture the demographic strategy of the long-lived pioneer species, an important component of many tropical forests (see the Perspective by Bugmann). They developed a forest model that allows for objective predictions of tropical forest dynamics and validated the model's predictions against independent data. These findings should advance our understanding of tropical forest dynamics and facilitate sustainable tropical forest management. Science , this issue p. 165 ; see also p. 128"

Despite this, transcriptional definition of cell populations that comprise both the medial habenular (MHb) and lateral habenular (LHb) subregions in mammals remain undefined. To resolve this, we performed single-cell transcriptional profiling and highly multiplexed in situ hybridization experiments of the mouse habenula complex in naive mice and those exposed to an acute aversive stimulus. Transcriptionally distinct neuronal cell types identified within the MHb and LHb, were spatially defined, differentially engaged by aversive stimuli, and had distinct electrophysiological properties. Cell types identified in mice also displayed a high degree of transcriptional similarity to those previously described in zebrafish, highlighting the well-conserved nature of habenular cell types across the phylum. These data identify key molecular targets within habenular cell types and provide a critical resource for future studies.

To further characterize neuronal cell types in detail, we re-clustered neuronal cells identified from the initial clustering. From this, we identified 16 discrete neuronal clusters (Figure 2A), among which 12 clusters were considered to be in the habenula due to expression of canonical gene markers (Aizawa et al., 2012Aizawa H.

To examine the transcriptional similarities between subclusters in the MHb and LHb, phylogenic trees were constructed based on a distance matrix in gene expression space (Figures 2D and 2E). In the MHb, subcluster no. 3 (MHb3) and no. 6 (MHb6) were closer in distance and were marked by Slc18a3 and Rapgef4 although MHb1, 2, 4, and 5 were in close proximity and were enriched with Kcng4 and Calb2. We further examined whether each MHb subcluster had unique marker genes. 16–224 genes were enriched in each MHb subcluster, but few single genes were cluster specific (expressed in >30% of cells in the enriched cluster; expressed in <10% of cells in the other subclusters). Thus, the majority of DEGs did not distinguish individual clusters alone, but their expression contributed toward a unique transcriptional profile, which, when analyzed in aggregate, accurately defined distinct cell types (expressed in >10% of cells in the ot"

We found that hepcidin, the master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis, is required for tissue repair in the mouse intestine after experimental damage. This effect was independent of hepatocyte-derived hepcidin or systemic iron levels. Rather, we identified conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) as a source of hepcidin that is induced by microbial stimulation in mice, prominent in the inflamed intestine of humans, and essential for tissue repair. cDC-derived hepcidin acted on ferroportin-expressing phagocytes to promote local iron sequestration, which regulated the microbiota and consequently facilitated intestinal repair. Collectively, these results identify a pathway whereby cDC-derived hepcidin promotes mucosal healing in the intestine through means of nutritional immunity."

In this study, we implanted a window to the mouse uterus to visualize the developing embryo from embryonic day 9.5 to birth. This removable intravital window allowed manipulation and high-resolution imaging. In live mouse embryos, we observed transient neurotransmission and early vascularization of neural crest cell (NCC)-derived perivascular cells in the brain, autophagy in the retina, viral gene delivery, and chemical diffusion through the placenta. We combined the imaging window with in utero electroporation to label and track cell division and movement within embryos and observed that clusters of mouse NCC-derived cells expanded in interspecies chimeras, whereas adjacent human donor NCC-derived cells shrank. This technique can be combined with various tissue manipulation and microscopy methods to study the processes of development at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution."
https://openalex.org/W3015917472,"Demand for agricultural crop continues to escalate in response to increasing population and damage of prime cropland for cultivation. Research interest is diverted to utilize soils with marginal plant production. Moisture stress has negative impact on crop growth and productivity. The plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and plant growth regulators (PGR) are vital for plant developmental process under moisture stress. The current study was carried out to investigate the effect of PGPR and PGRs (Salicylic acid and Putrescine) on the physiological activities of chickpea grown in sandy soil. The bacterial isolates were characterized based on biochemical characters including Gram-staining, P-solubilisation, antibacterial and antifungal activities and catalases and oxidases activities and were also screened for the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and ammonia (NH3). The bacterial strains were identified as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus megaterium based on the results of 16S-rRNA gene sequencing. Chickpea seeds of two varieties (Punjab Noor-2009 and 93127) differing in sensitivity to drought were soaked for 3 h before sowing in fresh grown cultures of isolates. Both the PGRs were applied (150 mg/L), as foliar spray on 20 days old seedlings of chickpea. Moisture stress significantly reduced the physiological parameters but the inoculation of PGPR and PGR treatment effectively ameliorated the adverse effects of moisture stress. The result showed that chickpea plants treated with PGPR and PGR significantly enhanced the chlorophyll, protein and sugar contents. Shoot and root fresh (81%) and dry weights (77%) were also enhanced significantly in the treated plants. Leaf proline content, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes (CAT, APOX, POD and SOD) were increased in reaction to drought stress but decreased due to PGPR. The plant height (61%), grain weight (41%), number of nodules (78%) and pod (88%), plant yield (76%), pod weight (53%) and total biomass (54%) were higher in PGPR and PGR treated chickpea plants grown in sandy soil. It is concluded from the present study that the integrative use of PGPR and PGRs is a promising method and eco-friendly strategy for increasing drought tolerance in crop plants."

The fossils appear to be from a well-differentiated lineage, suggesting that this species had been evolving within South America for some time.

In this study, AhWRKY family was comprehensively analyzed using bioinformatic approaches in combination with transcriptome sequencing data of the drought-tolerant peanut variety 'L422'. A total of 158 AhWRKY genes were identified and named according to their distribution on the chromosomes. Based on the structural features and phylogenetic analysis of AhWRKY proteins, the AhWRKY family members were classified into three (3) groups, of which group II included five (5) subgroups. Results of structure and conserved motifs analysis for the AhWRKY genes confirmed the accuracy of the clustering analysis. In addition, 12 tandem and 136 segmental duplication genes were identified. The results indicated that segmental duplication events were the main driving force in the evolution of AhWRKY family. Collinearity analysis found that 32 gene pairs existed between Arachis hypogaea and two diploid wild ancestors (Arachis duranensis and Arachis ipaensis), which provided valuable clues for phylogenetic characteristics of AhWRKY family. Furthermore, 19 stress-related cis-acting elements were found in the promoter regions. During the study of gene expression level of AhWRKY family members in response to drought stress, 73 differentially expressed AhWRKY genes were obtained to have been influenced by drought stress. These results provide fundamental insights for further study of WRKY genes in peanut drought resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3015859127,"The aims of the present study are to analyze the associations of different forms of dyadic coping (i.e., own supportive dyadic coping = OSDC; perceived supportive dyadic coping provided by the partner = PSDC; common dyadic coping = CDC) with relationship satisfaction, and to investigate whether these effects differ depending on the amount of perceived stress. In 240 couples, the different forms of dyadic coping and stress of both partners were assessed annually across 5 measurement points. Data was analyzed by dyadic multilevel models, which allow for disentangling between-person (overall, timely stable) from within-person (yearly, time specific) variations. The results revealed that all different forms of dyadic coping enhanced overall and yearly relationship satisfaction. At the same time, relationship satisfaction depends on the amount of overall and yearly stress. Interestingly, for PSDC, we found that the more a member of the couple was supported by the partner yearly (time-specific PSDC) and the more the member was stressed overall (timely stable), the higher the member scored on relationship satisfaction. For CDC, we found that yearly CDC beyond the overall level of CDC interacted with the timely stable amount of stress. Dealing together with stress and perceiving the partner as helpful were especially beneficial for relationship satisfaction. Findings highlight the importance of addressing specific forms of dyadic coping in intervention and prevention programs for couples."

Methods Data were collected between 2011 and 2019 within the framework of the LIFE Child study (Germany). Different subgroups of 10- to 12-year-old children and their parents (n (max) = 692) completed questionnaires on several health behaviors (diet, media use, physical activity, sleep), parameters of health (behavioral strengths and difficulties, psychosomatic complaints), and school grades. Agreement between child and parent reports was evaluated using weighted kappa coefficients. Furthermore, the frequencies of different types of (dis)agreement (parent report > child report, same response, child report > parent report) were assessed and checked for associations with child or parent gender. Results Agreement between child and parent reports varied from low to almost perfect, with the greatest levels of agreement for school grades and organized physical activity, and the lowest for dizziness, sleep duration, and the consumption of potatoes. Child gender had no significant effect on parent-child agreement. In contrast, the findings suggest that parent gender had some effect on agreement levels, with higher agreement for certain psychosomatic complaints when parent reports were completed by the mother, and higher agreement for white bread consumption if they were completed by the father. For some of the questionnaire items (especially those relating to behavioral difficulties and psychosomatic complaints, but also to the consumption of individual food products and mobile phone use), the type of (dis)agreement differed depending on child or parent gender. Conclusions The findings suggest that the perceptions and reporting strategies of children and their parents can diverge considerably, in particular for behavior that is not easily observable or measurable."

https://openalex.org/W3015983707,"The relative importance of bottom-up versus top-down effects in aquatic ecosystems remains a longstanding and ongoing controversy. To investigate these effects on phytoplankton communities in freshwater lakes, phytoplankton and zooplankton were sampled, and physical-chemical variables were measured during spring and summer in two important freshwater lakes in northern China: Nansi Lake and Dongping Lake. The redundancy analysis results showed that phytoplankton density and biomass were regulated by physical-chemical variables (bottom-up effects) and predation (top-down effects) together, and the former was more prominent in both lakes. However, the correlation analysis indicated that the top-down effects of zooplankton on phytoplankton were not significant in spring and summer in both lakes, while the bottom-up regulation of physical-chemical variables on phytoplankton had different patterns in the two lakes. In Nansi Lake, the bottom-up effects of physical-chemical variables on phytoplankton were weaker in summer than that in spring due to the abundant nutrients in summer. In Dongping Lake, the bottom-up effects of physical-chemical on phytoplankton were significant both in spring and summer, and the dominant bottom-up control factor shifted from total nitrogen in spring to total phosphorus in summer, with an increased ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus due to changes in limiting factors. In the two studied lakes, with fish culture, the bottom-up effects of phytoplankton on zooplankton were more important than the top-down effects of zooplankton on phytoplankton. These results demonstrate the interactions between phytoplankton and zooplankton and highlight the importance of phytoplankton regulation in freshwater lakes, which has implications for the effective management of freshwater lake ecosystems."

In cardiac surgery, only few ERAS protocols have been described in the past. At University Heart Center Hamburg, Germany, we invented an ERAS protocol for patients undergoing minimally invasive cardiac valve surgery. In this retrospective single center study, we aimed to describe the implementation of our ERAS program and to evaluate the results of the first 50 consecutive patients. Our ERAS protocol was developed according to a modified Kern cycle by an expert group, literature search, protocol creation and pilot implementation in the clinical practice. Data of the first 50 consecutive patients undergoing minimally invasive cardiac valve surgery were analysed retrospectively. The key features of our multidisciplinary ERAS protocol are physiotherapeutic prehabilitation, minimally invasive valve surgery techniques, modified cardiopulmonary bypass management, fast-track anaesthesia with on- table extubation and early mobilisation. A total of 50 consecutive patients (mean age of 51.9±11.9 years, mean STS score of 0.6±0.3) underwent minimally-invasive mitral or aortic valve surgery. The adherence to the ERAS protocol was high and neither protocol related complications nor in-hospital mortality occurred. 12% of the patients developed postoperative atrial fibrillation, postoperative delirium emerged in two patients and reintubation was required in one patient. Intensive care unit stay was 14.0±7.4 hours and total hospital stay 6.2±2.9 days.

The present study was carried out to investigate the effects of acute RE and RE training on gene expression profiles and histone modifications in human skeletal muscle. Healthy male adults were assigned to acute RE (n = 9, age = 20.5±4.3yr, BMI = 28.0±6.8kg/m2) or RE training (n = 21, age = 23.7±2.5yr, BMI = 24.2±2.7kg/m2) groups. Biopsy samples were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle before and three hours after a single bout of acute RE, or 3-days after 10 weeks of RE training. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that 153 genes with GO terms including muscle development, stress response, metabolism, cell death, and transcription factor were significantly up-regulated (+291% vs. pre-acute RE) upon acute RE. Expressions of these genes were also greater (+9.6% vs. pre-RE training, p<0.05) in RE trained subjects. Significant up-regulation of acetylated histone 3 (H3) (+235%) and H3 mono-methylated at lysine 4 (+290%) and tri-methylated at lysine 27 (+849%), whereas down-regulation of H3.3 variant (−39%) distributions relative to total H3 were observed at transcriptionally activated loci after acute RE compared to pre-acute RE levels. Interestingly, the distribution of acetylated H3 was found to be up-regulated as compared to the level of total H3 after RE training (+40%, p<0.05). These results indicate that a single bout of RE drastically alters both gene expressions and histone modifications in human skeletal muscle. It is also suggested that enhanced histone acetylation is closely related to up-regulation of gene expressions after RE training."

https://openalex.org/W3016130174,"The interferon system is the first line of defense against virus infection. Recently, using a high-throughput genetic screen of a human interferon-stimulated gene short-hairpin RNA library, we identified a viral restriction factor, TDRD7 (Tudor domain-containing 7). TDRD7 inhibits the paramyxo-/pneumoviruses (e.g. Sendai virus and respiratory syncytial virus) by interfering with the virus-induced cellular autophagy pathway, which these viruses use for their replication. Here, we report that TDRD7 is a viral restriction factor against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). Using knockdown, knockout, and ectopic expression systems, we demonstrate the anti-HSV-1 activity of TDRD7 in multiple human and mouse cell types. TDRD7 inhibited the virus-activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which was essential for HSV-1 replication. Genetic ablation or chemical inhibition of AMPK activity suppressed HSV-1 replication in multiple human and mouse cells. Mechanistically, HSV-1 replication after viral entry depended on AMPK but not on its function in autophagy. The antiviral activity of TDRD7 depended on its ability to inhibit virus-activated AMPK. In summary, our results indicate that the newly identified viral restriction factor TDRD7 inhibits AMPK and thereby blocks HSV-1 replication independently of the autophagy pathway. These findings suggest that AMPK inhibition represents a potential strategy to manage HSV-1 infections."

We analyzed the association of lipid profile parameters with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) risk and all-cause mortality in a nationally representative cohort of 51,757 lipid-lowering medication-naïve patients who had CKD and diabetes. Advanced CKD patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n = 10,775) had lower serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) but higher non-HDL-c levels and triglyceride (TG) to HDL-c ratios. There was a positive linear association between serum LDL-c and MACE risk in both early and advanced CKD patients (P <0.001 for trend), except for the category of LDL-c 30–49 mg/dL in extremely low LDL-c subgroup analyses. A U-shaped relationship was observed between serum LDL-c and all-cause mortality (the 4th and 8th octile groups; lowest hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87–1.05 and highest HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04–1.26, respectively). A similar pattern remained in both early and advanced CKD patients. The TG/HDL-c ratio categories showed a positive linear association for MACE risk in early CKD (P <0.001 for trend), but this correlation disappeared in advanced CKD patients. There was no correlation between the serum TG/HDL-c ratio and all-cause mortality in the study patients. The LDL-c level predicted the risk for MACEs and all-cause mortality in both early and advanced CKD patients with diabetes, although the patterns of the association differed from each other. However, the TG/HDL-c ratio categories could not predict the risk for either MACEs or all-cause mortality in advanced CKD patients with diabetes, except that the TG/HDL-c ratio predicted MACE risk in early CKD patients with diabetes."

Recently, it has emerged as an attractive target for managing obesity in humans. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis to identify genes associated with browning in murine adipose tissue. We focused on glycerol kinase (GYK) because its mRNA expression pattern is highly correlated with that of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which regulates the thermogenic capacity of adipocytes. Cold exposure-induced Ucp1 up-regulation in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) was partially abolished by Gyk knockdown (KD) in vivo. Consistently, the Gyk KD inhibited Ucp1 expression induced by treatment with the β-adrenergic receptors (βAR) agonist isoproterenol (Iso) in vitro and resulted in impaired uncoupled respiration. Gyk KD also suppressed Iso- and adenylate cyclase activator-induced transcriptional activation and phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). However, we did not observe these effects with a cAMP analog. Therefore Gyk KD related to Iso-induced cAMP products. In Iso-treated Gyk KD adipocytes, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) was up-regulated, and monounsaturated fatty acids such as palmitoleic acid (POA) accumulated. Moreover, a SCD1 inhibitor treatment recovered the Gyk KD-induced Ucp1 down-regulation and POA treatment down-regulated Iso-activated Ucp1. Our findings suggest that Gyk stimulates Ucp1 expression via a mechanism that partially depends on the βAR-cAMP-CREB pathway and Gyk-mediated regulation of fatty acid metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W3015567273,"Microarray batch effect (BE) has been the primary bottleneck for large-scale integration of data from multiple experiments. Current BE correction methods either need known batch identities (ComBat) or have the potential to overcorrect, by removing true but unknown biological differences (Surrogate Variable Analysis SVA). It is well known that experimental conditions such as array or reagent batches, PCR amplification or ozone levels can affect the measured expression levels; often the direction of perturbation of the measured expression is the same in different datasets. However, there are no BE correction algorithms that attempt to estimate the individual effects of technical differences and use them to correct expression data. In this manuscript, we show that a set of signatures, each of which is a vector the length of the number of probes, calculated on a reference set of microarray samples can predict much of the batch effect in other validation sets. We present a rationale of selecting a reference set of samples designed to estimate technical differences without removing biological differences. Putting both together, we introduce the Batch Effect Signature Correction (BESC) algorithm that uses the BES calculated on the reference set to efficiently predict and remove BE. Using two independent validation sets, we show that BESC is capable of removing batch effect without removing unknown but true biological differences. Much of the variations due to batch effect is shared between different microarray datasets. That shared information can be used to predict signatures (i.e. directions of perturbation) due to batch effect in new datasets. The correction can be precomputed without using the samples to be corrected (blind), done on each sample individually (single sample) and corrects only known technical effects without removing known or unknown biological differences (conservative). Those three characteristics make it ideal for high-throughput correction of samples for a microarray data repository. We also compare the performance of BESC to three other batch correction methods: SVA, Removing Unwanted Variation (RUV) and Hidden Covariates with Prior (HCP). An R Package besc implementing the algorithm is available from http://explainbio.com."

https://openalex.org/W3015489685,"Objective To determine if a commercial myostatin reducer (Fortetropin®) would inhibit disuse muscle atrophy in dogs after a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy. Design A prospective randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Animals One hundred client-owned dogs presenting for surgical correction of cranial cruciate ligament rupture by tibial plateau leveling osteotomy. Procedures Patients were randomly assigned into the Fortetropin® or placebo group and clients were instructed to add the assigned supplement to the dog’s normal diet once daily for twelve weeks. Enrolled patients had ultrasound measurements of muscle thickness, tape measure measurements of thigh circumference, serum myostatin level assays, and static stance analysis evaluated at weeks 0, 8, and 12. Results From week 0 to week 8, there was no change for thigh circumference in the Fortetropin® group for the affected limb (-0.54cm, P = 0.31), but a significant decrease in thigh circumference for the placebo group (-1.21cm, P = 0.03). There was no significant change in serum myostatin levels of dogs in the Fortetropin® group at any time point (P>0.05), while there was a significant rise of serum myostatin levels of dogs in placebo group during the period of forced exercise restriction (week 0 to week 8; +2,892 pg/ml, P = 0.02). The percent of body weight supported by the affected limb increased in dogs treated with Fortetropin® (+7.0%, P<0.01) and the placebo group (+4.9%, P<0.01) at the end of the period of forced exercise restriction. The difference in weight bearing between the Fortetropin® and placebo groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.10). Conclusion Dogs receiving Fortetropin® had a similar increase in stance force on the affected limb, no significant increase in serum myostatin levels, and no significant reduction in thigh circumference at the end of the period of forced exercise restriction compared to the placebo. These findings support the feeding of Fortetropin® to prevent disuse muscle atrophy in canine patients undergoing a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy."

We encourage neuroscientists to put emissions reductions at the center of their everyday professional activities. The world faces a climate emergency. Here, we consider the actions that can be taken by neuroscientists to tackle climate change. We encourage neuroscientists to put emissions reductions at the center of their everyday professional activities. Human activity has heated the planet by ∼1.1°C since pre-industrial times, and the average global temperature seems to be growing exponentially (Xu et al., 2018Xu Y. Ramanathan V. Victor D.G. Global warming will happen faster than we think.Nature. 2018; 564: 30-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The international consensus body of climate scientists, backed by governments, has called for a reduction in emissions of ∼50% by 2030 to try to keep the temperature increase to 1.5°C (IPCC, 2018IPCCIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report: Global Warming of 1.5 °C.https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/Date: 2018Google Scholar). A 50% reduction in emissions is a daunting undertaking that will require us to completely restructure our global economy around renewable sources of energy and sustainable development. If temperature is allowed to go much beyond 2°C as business-as-usual projections suggest (Rogelj et al., 2016Rogelj J. den Elzen M. Höhne N. Fransen T. Fekete H. Winkler H. Schaeffer R. Sha F. Riahi K. Meinshausen M. Paris Agreement climate proposals need a boost to keep warming well below 2 °C.Nature. 2016; 534: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar), then the possible consequences include mass despeciation, periodic deadly temperatures, rising sea levels that jeopardize many current population centers, food and water insecurity, ever-rising poverty levels, and the possibility of mass migration and further armed conflict between nations (Wallace-Wells, 2019Wallace-Wells D. The Uninhabitable Earth: A Story of the Future. Allen Lane, 2019Google Scholar) In this NeuroView, our focus is on the actions that can be taken by neuroscientists—researchers, clinicians, educators, administrators, and students—who make up the readership of Neuron. Our goal here is to ask how neuroscientists can reduce the emissions and waste that arise as a consequence of professional activities, including flying, teaching, research, and administration (Favaro, 2014Favaro B. A carbon code of conduct for science.Science. 2014; 344: 1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the face of political inaction, it is easy to feel that individuals count for little and that the cause is hopeless. However, many earlier movements have shown us that when individuals work together to take collective non-violent action, the consequences can ripple and undergird major societal and policy change (Chenoweth et al., 2011Chenoweth E. Stephan M.J. Stephan M.J. Why civil resistance works: The strategic logic of nonviolent conflict. Columbia University Press, 2011Google Scholar). Although climate science, social change, and geopolitics are not the traditional focus of our field, we believe that neuroscientists have important roles to play in shaping our generation’s obligation to tackle the climate emergency. A major way we can reduce our emissions as a field is by flying less (Nathans and Sterling, 2016Nathans J. Sterling P. How scientists can reduce their carbon footprint.eLife. 2016; 5: e15928Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Air travel accounts for around 4% of CO2 emissions globally (IPCC, 2018IPCCIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report: Global Warming of 1.5 °C.https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/Date: 2018Google Scholar) and is slated to grow dramatically over coming years. These emissions are mostly caused by a small percentage of the world’s population that includes many academics. The international nature of academic work has normalized frequent air travel as an intrinsic part of being a successful scientist, and many neuroscientists travel tens of thousands of miles per year to give talks or posters at invited seminars, workshops, and conferences. A researcher traveling from London to San Diego on an economy class return ticket would produce about 2.6 tons of CO2. According to some estimates, these CO2 emissions from one return flight are equivalent to living without a car for a year (2.4 tons), nearly double the emissions associated with switching a household to entirely renewable energy (1.4 tons), and nearly 3 times the emissions associated with moving from an omnivorous to a fully plant-based diet for a year (0.8 tons) (Wynes and Nicholas, 2017Wynes S. Nicholas K. The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions.Environ. Res. 2017; 12: 074024Google Scholar); these emissions are also 13 times the annual per capita emissions of a person in Tanzania. The carbon footprint of many researchers is thus disproportionately large compared to the population average. Furthermore, the largest conference in our field, the Society for Neuroscience meeting, takes place in a US city each year and attracts over 30,000 attendees. Given that most delegates arrive by air, including many from outside the US, it is easy to estimate that this conference alone contributes tens of thousands of tons of C02 in flights alone. One common argument against reducing CO2 emissions is that rather than flying less, we should simply pay for carbon offsets when purchasing air tickets. Carbon offsets are voluntary payments toward schemes that aim to reduce emissions or even reverse them (“drawdown”) and thus to neutralize the impact of our consumption. For example, one major neuroscience conference now offers a link for people to pay $15 to offset one ton of CO2, with that money used to buy water filters in Honduras to reduce the need for local people to use wood when boiling drinking water. However, a closer look at carbon offsets suggests that they are at best a partial solution and at worst actively harmful. There are at least three serious arguments against offsets. The first concerns uncertainty about the benefit that the offsets actually confer. It is important to realize that offsets only truly neutralize the impact of consumption if the schemes meet the additionality requirement; i.e., the emissions reductions would not have happened without our payment. For example, if a government scheme began to sanitize Honduran drinking water, then the offset one paid for one’s flight would not be additional. Analysis of a major scheme, the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto protocol, showed that the vast majority of projects for emissions reduction were not truly additional and also noted that the same problem continues to bedevil current schemes (Haya et al., 2019Haya B. Cullenward D. Strong A.L. Grubert E. Heilmayr R. Sivas D. Wara M. Managing Uncertainty in Carbon Offsets: Insights from California’s Standardized Approach.Stanford Law School ENRLP Program Working Paper. 2019; https://law.stanford.edu/publications/managing-uncertainty-in-carbon-offsets-insights-from-californias-standardized-approach/Google Scholar) There is thus uncertainty about whether such schemes truly offset the CO2 emitted by flying. Second, the scale of the activity required to truly offset the emissions cost of flying may be unfeasible or prohibitive. For example, reforestation enhances net uptake of carbon from the atmosphere and is thus widely regarded to be an important tool in combating climate change. However, reforestation may actually increase carbon emissions if not managed carefully (Naudts et al., 2016Naudts K. Chen Y. McGrath M.J. Ryder J. Valade A. Otto J. Luyssaert S. Europe’s forest management did not mitigate climate warming.Science. 2016; 351: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Furthermore, each tree planted only offsets ∼20 kilos of C02 per year, whereas annual emissions from aviation are about of half a billion tons; thus, vast, continent-sized stretches of land would need to be devoted to reforestation for viable offsetting (Skidmore et al., 2019Skidmore A.K. Wang T. de Bie K. Pilesjö P. Comment on “The global tree restoration potential”.Science. 2019; 366: 6469Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The final argument is that some offset schemes may inadvertently be actively harmful. Some may create perverse incentives. For example, methane capture schemes funded from offsets have been found to increase the profitability of coal mines, thus potentially prolonging their lifespan6. More generally, offset schemes may be actively detrimental to reducing emissions if they stem the tide of people who reduce their flying by offering a false hope that their footprint can be reduced with a small tax. In short, offset schemes may discourage us from flying less when in actuality, flying less is required to avoid catastrophic climate change. There is thus a risk that offsets do more harm than good. Additionally, it may be naive to imagine that a small payment, such as $15 per ton, can offset the several tons of emissions typically generated by a long-haul return flight. For comparison, the approximate cost of direct air carbon capture—a truly additional scheme—is ∼$200 per ton (Keith et al., 2018Keith D.W. Holmes G. St. Angelo D. Heidel K. A process for capturing CO2 from the atmosphere.Joule. 2018; 2: 1573-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (604) Google Scholar), an order of magnitude higher. And indeed, the consequence of paying the substantial fee for this near-certain and additional benefit would be to actually reduce flying itself. Overall, these considerations suggest that by far the best solution is to fly less and thus to help ensure that the planet’s reserves of carbon remain locked in the ground for as long as possible. Frequent travel allows neuroscientists to promote their work and thus increases the rate at which new ideas spread. Travel also builds and fosters our international community, as friendships, connections, and collaborations are forged between individuals in geographically distant laboratories with shared research interests. International travel may be particularly beneficial to more junior researchers or those from the developing world, who have not yet had a chance to establish themselves within the neuroscience community. Any call to climate action must therefore seek to mitigate the risk that some members will be disproportionately disadvantaged by steps taken to reduce emissions. The term “climate justice” recognizes that those whose actions have contributed the least to our planetary predicament thus far (i.e., the poor, the young, and the vulnerable) are likely to suffer the worst consequences of the climate emergency. Conversely, this means that those senior researchers who have built their careers by establishing networks of collaborations through many decades of frequent air travel should be first in line to commit to flying less. They should also be on the front line of arguing for institutional change in the service of emissions reductions. More generally, the culture of the academic neuroscience community currently places junior researchers (as well as those from developing countries) in an inescapable bind—it is very difficult to establish oneself without committing to traveling internationally to take up training positions abroad, to meet relevant senior colleagues, and to present work at conferences and seminars. We need to rethink how we build our networks within the neuroscience community and to normalize other modes of teaching, collaboration, and information dissemination that do not rely on in-person meetings. We need to find ways to allow everyone in the community—including students and early career researchers—to prosper without being obliged to commit to frequent travel. Of note, widespread adoption of new modes of interaction (such as immersive virtual reality) that do not require travel will have the additional benefit of widening participation to groups who typically find travel more difficult—for example, those from countries subject to visa restrictions or for whom travel is prohibitively expensive, those with disabilities, or those with young children or other family responsibilities that make prolonged absence from home particularly difficult. The organizers of conferences and workshops should consider measures that will reduce the carbon footprint of the event while continuing to widen participation. First, virtual participation can be encouraged. Although this has historically been a rather clumsy option to implement, rapid technological development means that immersive systems allowing for fluent interactions are now available at relatively low cost. One simple but effective measure is to make talks and submissions (e.g., papers, posters) freely available so that interested delegates from further afield do not have to travel by air to participate. Some conferences already offer excellent prototypes for this model. For example, the popular machine-learning conference NeurIPS makes videos of all events immediately and freely available online in an easily accessible format. Another suggestion is to organize the meeting according to a “hub and spokes” scheme where the main meeting (e.g., in country A, the “hub”) is accompanied by smaller meetings (in countries B–Z, the “spokes”) that are attended by local participants, with hub and spokes meetings linked by videoconference. The “spokes” meetings can combine broadcasts of talks and elaborate on discussions from the main meeting but simultaneously provide local activities that permit networking and facilitate the building of collaborations closer to home. Neuroscientists can also organize, support, and attend more local conferences and workshops. Although this may not completely replace international meetings, it is a step forward in reducing their number and size. More generally, we hope that it will become standard practice for conferences to publish their estimated carbon footprint (according to an agreed standard) to allow potential delegates to take this into consideration when choosing which meeting to attend (Ponette-González and Byrnes, 2011Ponette-González A.G. Byrnes J.E. Sustainable Science? Reducing the Carbon Impact of Scientific Mega-Meetings.EBL. 2011; 2: 65-71Crossref Google Scholar). Academics also frequently travel to deliver seminars. Organizers who are populating the speaker program could consider offering the option of a virtual visit, whereby the talk is delivered remotely and beforehand while the Q & A and/or 1:1 meetings could occur live via videoconference; good examples already exist. This approach would permit most of the high-quality interaction that normally occurs during a research visit. If the organizers are looking for in-person visitors, in the spirit of climate justice, they might consider reserving places for early career researchers or those from under-represented groups who stand to benefit more from the opportunity to meet and socialize face-to-face with like-minded colleagues. In addition, host institutions should ensure that in those areas where train travel is a viable alternative (e.g., across Europe), speaker invitations could include an encouragement to travel by land and confirm that the associated costs would be reimbursed even if they are higher than for plane travel. Funders have a part to play here, by making up the difference between flying and other forms of travel. Scientific research can be an enormously resource-intensive exercise. Even seemingly innocuous activities, such as using the internet, can contribute. The information and communications technology sector, which underpins much research, is estimated to be responsible for about 2% of global CO2 emissions. Most neuroscience researchers will recognize the energy-intensive nature of their research, in particular if it involves the analysis of large datasets or large-scale computational simulations. Although not directly related to climate change, we should also take seriously the ecological effects of plastic waste from laboratory equipment, protective clothing, animal care, and bench consumables, as well as toxic chemicals, all of which threaten biodiversity. We are also permanently depriving future generations of non-renewable resources like helium. As a profession, we need to work toward more sustainable practices in the long term. Some researchers have begun initiatives to try and reduce waste (see http://www.mygreenlab.org; for an example, see Rae, 2019Rae C. Climate change.https://www.sussex.ac.uk/psychology/abc-lab/climate-changeDate: 2019Google Scholar). However, the institutions within which we work must take on board the seriousness of the environmental crisis and weigh it equally with a commitment to individual health and safety. Funders and institutions need to consider whether all research is essential, given the planetary destruction it entails. One approach could be for institutional auditing of the resources used to generate a research output. Currently, people are rewarded for the money they spend (bigger grants meaning more promotion, etc.), but not penalized in any way for what they consume in the course of their research. We need a culture change within and across our institutions to tackle the climate emergency. A spin-off benefit will be allowing small, low-resource-use labs to compete on a more equal footing with their giant counterparts. Neuroscientists are researchers, clinicians, educators, and administrators and also public voices for science-based policies. As researchers and clinicians, we can fly less and try to influence others to do the same. As educators, we can also seek to directly instill in our staff and students a sense of urgency about the climate emergency through our personal interactions and in formal teaching settings. For example, we can teach classes that foreground the climate emergency or else build climate into our standard syllabus, for example, using the climate emergency when teaching about cognitive biases, decision-making, programming, or big data (Aron, 2019Aron A.R. The Climate Crisis Needs Attention from Cognitive Scientists.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2019; 23: 903-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As neuroscientists, we can collectively try to build a lab culture that acknowledges the scale of the challenge posed by the climate emergency and that is supportive of local initiatives that are geared at raising awareness or protesting inaction. One could convene or request a lab meeting on how the team can reduce emissions in its everyday activities. As administrators and members of institutional bodies, we have yet more leverage. For example, we may sit on department and university-wide committees that make decisions about travel, spending, and investments. We can recommend that videoconferencing is used for seminars; that large open-house visits are replaced with systematic virtual interviews; that catering for departmental events has mainly vegetarian or vegan options; that our departments and institutions shift funds out of the principal banks that are heavily implicated in funding fossil fuel extraction; that our university endowments and pensions are divested of fossil fuel stocks; that we and our colleagues learn how to purge our personal retirement funds of fossil fuel stocks; that our campuses shift local energy supplies away from natural gas to majority electricity and eventually renewable-supplied electricity; that our campuses invest in better transportation to discourage personal solitary driving; and many other actions. Students and early career researchers who do not sit on institutional committees can nevertheless organize themselves to campaign for these changes, especially where departments are slow to react. Finally, we can also be public voices for science-based responses to the climate emergency. The neuroscience community also encompasses people involved in grant review and the disbursement of research funds. They too have a significant role in tackling the climate emergency. When researchers submit requests for research funds to government agencies or charitable foundations, they are required to provide a detailed breakdown of the financial costs of the research. These are scrutinized by reviewers and grant panels, and funds can be withheld if costs seem unwarranted. We suggest that funding bodies request an emissions-counting component, calculated according to agreed guidelines. For example, grants that propose a large number of international flights or that invoke major power costs (e.g., fMRI scanning or heavy computing resources) should be asked to note (and/or justify where useful) the emissions. These costs may be non-negligible. For example, annual emissions from a single fMRI scanner may be as much as 16 tons of CO2, even without taking into account substantial manufacturing and decommisioning contributions (Herrmann and Rock, 2012Herrmann C. Rock A. Magnetic resonance equipment (MRI) – Study on the potential for environmental improvement by the aspect of energy efficiency.PE International AG, Report. 2012; http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph240/nam2/docs/herrmann.pdfGoogle Scholar). Of note, the intention here is not to debar researchers from engaging in valuable research activities or essential travel but merely to encourage a culture in which we meticulously count the cost of research to the climate emergency. Funding bodies have tremendous influence and thus a great opportunity to tackle this issue. One potential model is the Athena Swan Charter, which sought to promote equality of opportunity among the sexes in UK higher education. Since 2011, a Silver Award, offered to department and universities with an outstanding track record of promoting gender equality under the Athena Swan commission, has been a precondition for eligibility for funding from major UK sources. In the years immediately following this change, the number of university departments with awards increased from just seven to over 200. In a similar vein, funding bodies who are evaluating large-scale institutional bids for research centers, infrastructure improvements, or doctoral training programs could consider the emissions reduction commitments of the applicant as a part of the evaluation process or even consider restricting eligibility to departments or institutes that have met appropriate targets. These steps may seem unnecessarily burdensome for academics who may already be overworked. However, we argue that a radical problem calls for radical solutions. These specific suggestions aside, we hope that funders will consider using their influence wisely to tackle the climate emergency. Emissions reductions must happen urgently. While large political systems equivocate, grassroots action can sway political activity. The actions proposed here are thus important steps toward prompting the major top-down social and economic changes that must eventually happen, such as equitable carbon taxes and widespread investment in renewable energy sources. Neuroscientists can be part of this change. They can make personal changes such as flying less, and by doing so and advertising it, they will support a growing culture that has the potential to lead to major emissions reductions. Neuroscientists are also situated within universities, professional societies, and research bodies where they can work with colleagues to inculcate myriad changes, including virtual conferencing, measuring and reducing waste, divesting banking and investments from exposure to fossil fuel companies, and reforming funding practices. In so doing, they can contribute to a fundamental shift in the ethos of our institutions to put emissions reductions into the very fabric of standard operations at every level. Doing so will safeguard the ongoing practice of neuroscience. We hope that the readers of Neuron will feel inspired to take up the challenges we raise here and that we can work together to ensure that the mysteries of the brain will still be studied with equal vigor 100 years from now."

https://openalex.org/W3015797295,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a widely-used surgical intervention for treating patients with end-stage degenerative and inflammatory osteoarthropathy. However, wear particles from the artificial titanium joint can induce osteolysis, limiting the long-term survivorship of THA. Monocyte/macrophage lineage cells are the key players in the response to wear particles, and the proinflammatory NF-κB and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT)-signaling pathways have been shown to be the most important contributors to wear particle–induced osteolysis. In contrast, ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) specifically removes the polyubiquitin chains from the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family Caspase recruitment domain (CARD)–containing 5 (NLRC5) and thereby enhances the NLRC5-mediated inhibition of NF-κB signaling. In this study, we aimed to clarify the role of the USP14–NLRC5 pathway in wear particle–induced osteolysis in vitro and in vivo. We found that NLRC5 or USP14 overexpression inhibits titanium particle–induced proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) production and NF-κB pathway activation, and it also decreases M1 macrophage polarization and PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Of note, NLRC5 and USP14 overexpression attenuated titanium particle–induced cranial osteolysis in mice. In conclusion, the findings of our study indicate that the USP14–NLRC5 pathway inhibits titanium particle–induced osteolysis by suppressing the NF-κB and PI3K/AKT pathways both in vitro and in vivo.

However, hip prosthesis only has an in-service life of 15–25 years, and nearly all of the patients need to receive revision surgery (1Man K. Jiang L. Foster R. Yang X. Immunological responses to total hip arthroplasty.J. Funct. Biomater. 2017; 8 (28762999): 3310.3390/jfb8030033Crossref Google Scholar). According to a complication-based analysis using worldwide arthroplasty registers, the most common cause for revision in THA was aseptic loosening (55.2%) (2Sadoghi P. Liebensteiner M. Agreiter M. Leithner A. Böhler N. Labek G. Revision surgery after total joint arthroplasty: a complication-based analysis using worldwide arthroplasty registers.J.

In China, a retrospective study conducted on 405 consecutive patients who underwent revision hip arthroplasty found that prosthesis loosening was the most common cause for revision hip arthroplasty (69.14%) (3Jun L.R.

It has been reported that wear particles from the artificial joint are the triggering cause of periprosthetic osteolysis and the consequent aseptic loosening (4Massin P. Achour S. Wear products of total hip arthroplasty: the case of polyethylene.Morphologie. 2017; 101 (27426252): 1-810.1016/j.morpho.2016.06.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, there is no effective nonsurgical treatment to prevent and cure this complication currently.

Monocyte/macrophage lineage cells play a significant role in immunology, tissue homeostasis, disease pathogenesis, and inflammation. Macrophages are the key players in the response to wear particles from prostheses (5Pajarinen J. Lin T.H. Nabeshima A. Jämsen E. Lu L. Nathan K. Yao Z. Goodman S.B. Mesenchymal stem cells in the aseptic loosening of total joint replacements.J. Biomed. Mater. Res. A. 2017; 105 (27977880): 1195-120710.1002/jbm.a.35978Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Macrophages, upon activation by wear particles, release a series of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which recruit and activate osteoclast precursors and trigger inflammatory bone resorption. Subsequently, mature osteoclast-mediated bone resorption leads to periprosthetic osteolysis and long-term aseptic loosening (6Eger M. Hiram-Bab S. Liron T. Sterer N. Carmi Y. Kohavi D. Gabet Y. Mechanism and prevention of titanium particle–induced inflammation and osteolysis.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 (30619321): 296310.3389/fimmu.2018.02963Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Yang H.

Macrophage activation in osteolysis may lead to macrophage polarization (8Murray P.J. Allen J.E. Biswas S.K. Fisher E.A. Gilroy D.W. Goerdt S. Gordon S. Hamilton J.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Lawrence T.

After exposure to different stimuli, the resting macrophages (M0) are capable of polarizing to two specific phenotypes with “classically-” and “alternatively-” activated macrophages, representing proinflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages (9Gu Q. Yang H. Shi Q. Macrophages and bone inflammation.J. Orthop. Transl. 2017; 10: 86-9310.1016/j.jot.2017.05.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Wear particles have been proved to activate the macrophages that induced an M1 macrophage phenotype promoting local secretion of inflammatory cytokines (10Wang X. Li Y. Feng Y. Cheng H. Li D. Macrophage polarization in aseptic bone resorption around dental implants induced by Ti particles in a murine model.J. Periodontal Res. 2019; 54 (30635919): 329-33810.1111/jre.12633Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). M1 macrophage polarization is associated with high levels of these cytokines, so it is tempting to ascribe M1 macrophages as cells promoting osteoclastogenesis, although the M2 macrophages would inhibit this process (11Horwood N.J. Macrophage polarization and bone formation: a review.Clin. Rev. Allergy Immunol. 2016; 51 (26498771): 79-8610.1007/s12016-015-8519-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, numerous studies in vivo and in vitro have indicated that the inhibition of the macrophage polarization to the M1 phenotype might be served as novel therapeutic strategies for periprosthetic osteolysis (6Eger M. Hiram-Bab S. Liron T. Sterer N. Carmi Y. Kohavi D. Gabet Y. Mechanism and prevention of titanium particle–induced inflammation and osteolysis.Front.

Although it is commonly believed that macrophages are the key cells in the response to wear particles associated with periprosthetic osteolysis, how the macrophages were activated and polarized is poorly understood. Inflammatory reactions associated with wear particles in macrophages are mediated by several important signaling pathways, the most important of which involves the NF-κB and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathways. NF-κB activation is essential for macrophage recruitment and maturation, inducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β (13Lin T.H. Tamaki Y. Pajarinen J. Waters H.A. Woo D.K. Yao Z. Goodman S.B. Chronic inflammation in biomaterial-induced periprosthetic osteolysis: NF-κB as a therapeutic target.Acta Biomater. 2014; 10 (24090989): 1-1010.1016/j.actbio.2013.09.034Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, NF-κB activation contributes to osteoclast differentiation and maturation via binding of RANKL and osteoclast-associated RANK (14Holding C.A. Findlay D.M. Stamenkov R. Neale S.D. Lucas H. Dharmapatni A.S. Callary S.A. Shrestha K.R. Atkins G.J. Howie D.W. Haynes D.R.

A number of researchers have reported that repressing NF-κB–signaling pathway activation could attenuate wear debris–induced osteolysis (15An S. Han F. Hu Y. Liu Y. Li J. Wang L. Curcumin inhibits polyethylene-induced osteolysis via repressing NF-κB signaling pathway activation.Cell. Physiol.

Our previous study has shown that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a positive role in the regulation of activating macrophages by wear particles. The inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway reduces TNFα production in the macrophage response to wear particles in vitro (18Huang J.B. Ding Y. Huang D. Liang A.J. Zeng W.K. Zeng Z.P. Qin C.Q. Barden B. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway reduces tumor necrosis factor-α production in the cellular response to wear particles in vitro.Artif.

Furthermore, TNFα promoted osteoclast precursor cell differentiation through the PI3K/Akt-signaling pathway (20Wu L. Guo Q. Yang J. Ni B. Tumor necrosis factor α promotes osteoclast formation via PI3K/Akt pathway-mediated blimp1 expression upregulation.J. Cell. Biochem. 2017; 118 (27505147): 1308-131510.1002/jcb.25672Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Also, the PI3K/Akt pathway has been identified as one of the numerous signaling pathways essential for promoting macrophage M1 polarization over the years (21Linton M.F. Moslehi J.J. Babaev V.R. Akt signaling in macrophage polarization, survival, and atherosclerosis.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20 (31159424): E270310.3390/ijms20112703Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent implant loosening is to suppress NF-κB- and PI3K/Akt-signaling pathways, and our previous studies have explored them. However, the effects are not totally satisfactory and are far from clinical applications. Undoubtedly, it is necessary to explore new regulators of these signaling pathways. The NOD-like receptor family CARD domain containing 5 (NLRC5) is the largest member of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) family, involved in various physiological processes, such as inflammation, innate immunity, and diabetic nephropathy (22Benkö S. Kovács E.G. Hezel F. Kufer T.A. NLRC5 functions beyond MHC I regulation–what do we know so far?.Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 (28261210): 15010.3389/fimmu.2017.00150Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Several studies have identified NLRC5 as a negative regulator that blocks IKKα and IKKβ, two central components of the NF-κB–signaling pathways, and has important roles in homeostatic control of innate immunity (23Cui J. Zhu L. Xia X. Wang H.Y. Legras X. Hong J. Ji J. Shen P. Zheng S. Chen Z.J. Wang R. NLRC5 negatively regulates the NF-κB and type I interferon signaling pathways.Cell. 2010; 141 (20434986): 483-49610.1016/j.cell.2010.03.040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 24Tong Y. Cui J. Li Q. Zou J. Wang H.Y. Wang R. Enhanced TLR-induced NF-κB signaling and type I interferon responses in NLRC5 deficient mice.Cell Res. 2012; 22 (22473004): 822-83510.1038/cr.2012.53Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). NLRC5 negatively regulates TLR2-mediated allergic airway inflammation via the NF-κB pathway (25Wang M. Wang L. Fang L. Li S. Liu R. NLRC5 negatively regulates LTA-induced inflammation via TLR2/NF-κB and participates in TLR2-mediated allergic airway inflammation.J. Cell. Physiol. 2019; 10.1002/jcp.28596Google Scholar). Besides, knockdown of NLRC5 in vitro attenuates renal I/R injury in vitro through the activation of the PI3K/Akt-signaling pathway (26Han F. Gao Y. Ding C.G. Xia X.X. Wang Y.X. Xue W.J. Ding X.M. Zheng J. Tian P.X. Knockdown of NLRC5 attenuates renal I/R injury in vitro through the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Biomed. Pharmacother. 2018; 103 (29655162): 222-22710.1016/j.biopha.2018.04.040Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) specifically removes the polyubiquitin chains from NLRC5 to enhance NLRC5-mediated inhibition of NF-κB signaling (27Meng Q. Cai C. Sun T. Wang Q. Xie W. Wang R. Cui J. Reversible ubiquitination shapes NLRC5 function and modulates NF-κB activation switch.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 211 (26620909): 1025-104010.1083/jcb.201505091Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). USP14 is one of three proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes that remove ubiquitin from proteasomal substrates prior to their degradation. However, very little is known about the role of USP14/NLRC5 in the process of wear particles activating macrophages and triggering periprosthetic osteolysis and aseptic loosening. This study therefore investigates the effect of USP14/NLRC5 to regulate the inflammatory response of macrophages and periprosthetic osteolysis due to wear particles. The brown color in Fig. 1A showed the staining intensity of the interest protein expressed in cytoplasm. TNFα was barely detected in synovial tissues of patients with femoral head necrosis but was highly expressed in the synovial membrane around the prosthesis in patients with aseptic loosening. In contrast, there is a lower expression of NLRC5 and USP14 in the patients with aseptic loosening compared with patients with femoral head necrosis (Fig. 1A). The average immunoreactivity score (IS) of TNFα in AL group was 1.57 ± 0.21, significantly higher than that in FHN patients (0.17 ± 0.12, p < 0.05), similar to the tendency of IL-6 (1.33 ± 0.21 versus 0.15 ± 0.06). Meanwhile, the average IS of NLRC5 significantly decreased in the AL group compared with FHN group (0.28 ± 0.10 versus 1.13 ± 0.15, p < 0.05). A similar tendency was found in USP14 (0.22 ± 0.13 versus 1.05 ± 0.13, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). To investigate the expression change of TNFα, NLRC5, and USP14 at different levels in macrophages after stimulation by Ti particles, we performed real-time PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA with J774A.1 cells and the culture supernatants. The mRNA expression of TNFα in macrophages was significantly up-regulated after the stimulation of Ti particles at every time point (p < 0.05). Besides, mRNA expressions of NLRC5 and USP14 decreased after 1 h of Ti stimulation and kept up-regulating when stimulated for more than 1 h (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). ELISA results showed that the concentration of TNFα-secreted protein in the culture supernatants increased continuously when stimulated by Ti particles (Fig. 2B). In contrast, protein levels of NLRC5 and USP14 decreased in J774A.1 cells when treated with Ti particles and LPS for 24 h, whereas the ubiquitination level of NLRC5 by Ti particles and LPS treatment was enhanced at 1 h after stimulation (Fig. 2C). NF-κB–signaling pathway and downstream proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in wear particle–induced periprosthetic osteolysis. Thus, we investigated the effect of USP14 and NLRC5 on the NF-κB pathway and TNFα and in J774A.1 cells stimulated by Ti particles. We stimulated the USP14/NLRC5-knockdown J774a.1 cells and the negative control cells with the Ti particles, and then we performed real-time PCR and ELISA to examine the expression of TNFα. An increased mRNA expression of TNFα was observed in USP14/NLRC5-knockdown J774a.1 cells compared with the negative control cells at each time points after stimulation (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). ELISA results showed the similar increase in secreted protein of TNFα in USP14/NLRC5-knockdown J774a.1 cells compared with the negative control cells after stimulation (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting were performed to explore the effect of USP14 and NLRC5 on the NF-κB–signaling pathway. As the immunofluorescent staining results showed, P65, a transcription factor of the NF-κB family, was observed with more translocation into nuclei of USP14-knockdown J774a.1 cells than those of control cells after Ti stimulation for 1 h (Fig. 3C). Quantitative analysis of fluorescence imaging confirmed that the ratio of P65 fluorescence value at the nucleus/cytoplasm in USP14-knockdown J774A.1 cells is higher than that in negative control cells (Fig. S1A), representing the enhanced activation of NF-κB–signaling pathway. What's more, Western blotting showed that the protein expression of phospho-IκBα and phospho-P65 was up-regulated after Ti and LPS stimulation, which was enhanced by the knockdown of USP14. Meanwhile, NLRC5 protein in USP14-knockdown J774A.1 cells decreased after Ti and LPS stimulation compared with NC cells, but no change was observed between the groups without stimulation (Fig. 3D). To further elucidate the effect of USP14 and NLRC5 on the NF-κB pathway and TNFα and in J774A.1 cells stimulated by Ti particles, we transfected USP14/NLRC5-expressing vector into J774A.1 cells to overexpress USP14 and NLRC5. Real-time PCR and ELISA were performed to examine the expression of TNFα after stimulation by Ti particles. As shown in Figs. 4A and 5A, overexpression of NLRC5 or USP14 significantly suppressed the mRNA expression of TNFα (p < 0.05). ELISA results showed that both USP14 and NLRC5 overexpression significantly attenuated the increase in secreted protein of TNFα (p < 0.05) (Figs. 4B and 5B). Immunofluorescent staining results showed that NLRC5 or USP14 overexpression reduced the translocation of P65 into the nuclei after Ti stimulation (Figs. 4C and 5C), which was confirmed by the quantitative analysis of the fluorescence image (Fig. S1, B and C). Apparently, Western blotting results showed that overexpression of NLRC5 or USP14 suppressed the up-regulation of protein expression of phospho-IκBα and phospho-P65 after Ti and LPS stimulation, confirming the effect of NLRC5 and USP14 on the NF-κB–signaling pathway (Figs. 4D and 5D). Besides, the protein level of NLRC5 in USP14-overexpressed cells was higher than that of normal cells, while its ubiquitinated level decreased in USP14-overexpressed J774A.1 cells compared with normal cells after Ti and LPS stimulations (Fig. 4D).Figure 5Expression of TNFα and NF-κB pathway in USP14-overexpressed J774A.1 cells compared with normal cells after titanium stimulation.

B, lower concentration of secreted TNFα protein was detected in USP14-overexpressed J774A.1 cells compared with normal cells at every time point after titanium stimulation. *, p < 0.05. C, P65 was observed with less translocation into the nuclei of USP14-overexpressed J774A.1 cells than those of normal cells after titanium stimulation.

The macrophages were identified by F4/80 and the M1-specific marker, iNOS. Representative dot plots of the different experimental groups are displayed in Fig. 6A. The flow cytometry results showed that the Ti stimulation caused an increase in the percentage of iNOS-positive cells in all groups (0.233 ± 0.08% versus 10.287 ± 0.878%, 0.360 ± 0.205% versus 7.007 ± 0.818%, and 0.537 ± 0.293% versus 2.350 ± 1.000%), and overexpression of NLRC5 and USP14 attenuated this M1 polarization of macrophages (Fig. 6B). To further explore the mechanisms of how USP14 and NLRC5 attenuated the M1 polarization of macrophages induced by Ti particles, Western blotting was carried out to observe the effect of USP14 and NLRC5 on the PI3K/Akt-signaling pathway 30 min after Ti stimulation. As shown in Fig. 6C, PI3K and Akt protein expression kept still while phospho-PI3K and phospho-Akt protein expressions were up-regulated after Ti stimulation, which was attenuated by NLRC5 and USP14 overexpression. The mouse model of cranial osteolysis induced by Ti particles was performed, and the local macrophage recruitment on the mid-line sagittal suture of the calvarium was investigated by BLI following the injection of the J774A.1 reporter macrophage expressing luciferase. From day 1 to day 7, bioluminescence was observed on the vertical images of mice injected with J774A.1 reporter cells that were respectively designed as NLRC5 and USP14-overexpressed and normal vector cells, indicating the continuous macrophage recruitment induced by Ti particles and the J774A.1 cells with genetic manipulation reactions to Ti particles (Fig. 7A). 7 days later, the crania of all the mice were harvested and performed with micro-CT scanning. 3-Dimensional reconstruction of the mouse crania showed an area of osteolysis around the cranial sutures in the mice treated with titanium particles compared with the sham group, which was alleviated by the overexpression of NLRC5 or USP14 (Fig. 7B). Bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) and bone mineral density (BMD) of a 1 × 3-mm region of interest (ROI) around the cranial suture were evaluated by micro-CT. Quantitative analysis in Table 1 showed a significant decrease in Ti-treated groups compared with a sham group in BV/TV (p < 0.05) and BMD (p < 0.05). Ti particle–induced bone loss was significantly attenuated in the NLRC5/USP14-overexpressed group (p < 0.05, Fig. 7C).Table 1BV/TV and BMD of each group of mice. o/e, overexpressedSham (mean ± S.D.)Ti+ vector (mean ± S.D.)Ti+ NLRC5-o/e (mean ± S.D.)Ti+ USP14-o/e (mean ± S.D.)BV/TV (%)20.29 ± 1.5014.30 ± 0.9417.48 ± 1.0918.38 ± 0.79BMD (g/cm3)0.190 ± 0.0110.136 ± 0.0130.171 ± 0.0090.177 ± 0.012 Open table in a new tab Immunohistochemistry assay of mouse calvaria showed that the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 were highly expressed in the Ti-treated groups compared with the sham group. But within the Ti-treated groups, TNFα and IL-6 expression levels in the NLRC5 and USP14 overexpression groups were lower than those of the normal cells group. Trap+ cell numbers per field of the normal group (34.00 ± 6.40 cells), the NLRC5-overexpressed group (23.80 ± 3.70 cells), and the USP14-overexpressed group (24.80 ± 5.26 cells) were significantly more than that of Sham group (12.20 ± 3.11 cells, p < 0.05 respectively). Meanwhile, the Trap+ cells in NLRC5/USP14-overexpressed groups were lower than those in normal group (Fig. 8A). Counting of Trap+ cell numbers confirmed the above conclusion (Fig. 8B). The long-term survivorship of THA is limited by wear particle–induced osteolysis, in which the monocyte/macrophage lineage cells play a pivotal role. The biotoxicity, biocompatibility, and mechanics properties have been greatly renovated with the regeneration of prosthesis materials, but the aseptic loosening caused by wear particles still remain unsolved (1Man K. Jiang L. Foster R. Yang X. Immunological responses to total hip arthroplasty.J. Funct. Biomater. 2017; 8 (28762999): 3310.3390/jfb8030033Crossref Google Scholar). Upon activation by wear particles, macrophages release a series of proinflammatory cytokine-like TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β, which induce the recruitment of macrophage and trigger the activation of osteoclast precursors (4Massin P.

https://openalex.org/W3015947115,"Background In the cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis, de- and remyelination can be studied without major interference from the adaptive immune responses. Since previous proteomic studies did not focus on the corpus callosum, where cuprizone causes the most pronounced demyelination, we performed a bottom up proteomic analysis on this brain region. Methods Eight week-old mice treated with 0.2% cuprizone, for 4 weeks and controls (C) were sacrificed after termination of the treatment (4wD), and 2 (2dR) or 14 (2wR) days later. Homogenates of dissected corpus callosum were analysed by quantitative proteomics. For data processing, clustering, gene ontology analysis, and regulatory network prediction, we used Perseus, PANTHER and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis softwares, respectively. Results We identified 4886 unmodified, single- or multi phosphorylated and/or gycosylated (PTM) proteins. Out of them, 191 proteins were differentially regulated in at least one experimental group. We found 57 proteins specific for demyelination, 27 for early- and 57 for late remyelinationwhile 36 proteins were affected in two, and 23 proteins in all three groups. Phosphorylation represented 92% of the post translational modifications among differentially regulated modified (PTM) proteins with decreased level, while it was only 30% of the PTM proteins with increased level. Gene ontology analysis could not classify the demyelination specific proteins into any biological process category, while allocated the remyelination specific ones to nervous system development and myelination as the most specific subcategory. We also identified a protein network in experimental remyelination, and the gene orthologues of the network were differentially expressed in remyelinating multiple sclerosis brain lesions consistent with an early remyelination pattern. Conclusion Proteomic analysis seems more informative for remyelination than demyelination in the cuprizone model."

The volume of all pores is the total volume of the pores. The properties of the individual pores are different. Their dimensions and shape can influence the properties of materials. Materials are modified with different admixtures to improve their properties. However, additives or admixtures can cause corrosion. Although building materials do not provide food for microorganisms, they are very often inhabited by them. As a result of their presence and the action of metabolic products, biodeterioration occurs. One of the products of metabolism is water. In this paper we investigated how the modified structure of biodeterioration caused by mould fungi affects the moisture content of cement-polymer mortar with the admixture of polysiloxane latex."

This article contributes to the deep understanding of the cultural aspects of the integration of oral health into primary health care at an Indigenous health organization. Proceeding from a collaborative and interdisciplinary research project evaluating the integration of oral health care within primary care in Eeyou Istchee, this research is based on group discussions (6) and individual interviews (36) with 74 participants (care providers, administrators, and patients) held in four Eastern James Bay Cree communities. This study anthropologically explored participants’ perceptions about primary health care conceptualizations, culturally based approaches, and experiences of oral care services at this organization using a “two-eyed seeing” Indigenous framework. The study identified three key factors related to the integration of primary oral health care: Cree perception of primary health and oral health care, cultural safety, and health provider–patient communication and the role of silence. Study findings reflected a dichotomy of perception of primary health care and the relevant units of care between the Cree structural and cultural perspective and the non-Cree professional perspective. The Cree people perceived “household” as a unit of care in comparison to non-Cree who viewed “health care services” as units of care. Our results also underline the role of cultural safety agents to address the needs for cultural competence and the role of silence as implicit cultural protocol. Our anthropological analysis illustrates the potential for increasing the level of appreciation for both users and workers in oral care in the future by ameliorating communication skills and intercultural knowledge."

Female and male fracture patients were selected for comparison by using a propensity-score matching procedure. Age, low income, types of fracture, fracture with surgery, several medical conditions, number of hospitalization and emergency visits were considered as potential confounding factors. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (OR), the 95% CI of post-fracture complications and 30-day in-hospital mortality differences between women and men.Male patients had a higher risk of post-fracture pneumonia (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.83-2.11), acute renal failure (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.60-2.15), deep wound infection (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.51-1.77), stroke (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.49-1.67), septicemia (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.42-1.61), acute myocardial infarction (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09-1.75) and 30-day in-hospital mortality (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.48-1.93) compared with female patients. However, a lower risk of post-fracture urinary tract infection (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.65-0.72) was found in men than in women. Male patients also had longer hospital stays and higher medical expenditures due to fracture admission than did the female patients. Higher rates of post-fracture adverse events in male patients were noted in all age groups and all types of fractures.We raised the possibility that male patients showed more complications and higher mortality rates after fracture admission compared with female patients, with the exception of urinary tract infections."
https://openalex.org/W3015612370,"Prolonged hyperuricemia is a cause of gout and an independent risk factor for chronic health conditions including diabetes and chronic kidney diseases. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for serum uric acid (SUA) concentrations have repeatedly confirmed genetic loci including those encoding uric acid transporters such as ABCG2 and SLC9A2. However, many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in GWASs have been common variants with small effects and unknown functions. In addition, there is still much heritability to be explained. To identify the causative genetic variants for SUA concentrations in Korean subjects, we conducted a GWAS (1902 males) and validation study (2912 males and females) and found four genetic loci reaching genome-wide significance on chromosomes 4 (ABCG2) and 11 (FRMD8, EIF1AD and SLC22A12-NRXN2). Three loci on chromosome 11 were distributed within a distance of 1.3 megabases and they were in weak or moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD) states (r2 = 0.02–0.68). In a subsequent association analysis on the GWAS loci of chromosome 11 using closely positioned markers derived from whole genome sequencing data, the most significant variant to be linked with the nearby GWAS signal was rs121907892 (c.774G>A, p.W258*) of the SLC22A12 gene. This variant, and each of the three GWAS SNPs, were in LD (r2 = 0.06–0.32). The strength of association of SNPs with SUA concentration (negative logarithm of P-values) and the genetic distance (r2 of LD) between rs121907892 and the surrounding SNPs showed a quantitative correlation. This variant has been found only in Korean and Japanese subjects and is known to lower the SUA concentration in the general population. Thus, this low-frequency variant, rs121907892, known to regulate SUA concentrations in previous studies, is responsible for the nearby GWAS signals."

Both clinical and preclinical data indicate that obesity, along with comorbidity insulin resistance, is a predisposing factor for cholelithiasis. Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) is a key transcription factor that integrates insulin signaling with hepatic metabolism and becomes deregulated in the insulin-resistant liver, contributing to dyslipidemia in obesity. To gain mechanistic insights into how insulin resistance is linked to cholelithiasis, here we determined FoxO1's role in bile acid homeostasis and its contribution to cholelithiasis. We hypothesized that hepatic FoxO1 deregulation links insulin resistance to impaired bile acid metabolism and cholelithiasis. To address this hypothesis, we used the FoxO1LoxP/LoxP-Albumin-Cre system to generate liver-specific FoxO1-knockout mice. FoxO1-knockout mice and age- and sex-matched WT littermates were fed a lithogenic diet, and bile acid metabolism and gallstone formation were assessed in these animals. We showed that FoxO1 affected bile acid homeostasis by regulating hepatic expression of key enzymes in bile acid synthesis and in biliary cholesterol and phospholipid secretion. Furthermore, FoxO1 inhibited hepatic expression of the bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor and thereby counteracted hepatic farnesoid X receptor signaling. Nonetheless, hepatic FoxO1 depletion neither affected the onset of gallstone disease nor impacted the disease progression, as FoxO1-knockout and control mice of both sexes had similar gallstone weights and incidence rates.

Synthesized from cholesterol primarily in the liver, bile acids are conjugated with taurine or glycine and are secreted into the bile. Conjugated bile acids, known as bile salts, are stored in the gallbladder in fasting states. After meals, bile acids are released from the gallbladder into the intestine, where bile acids function as physiochemical detergents to facilitate the absorption of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins (15Chiang J.Y. Bile acids: Regulation of synthesis.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50 (19346330): 1955-196610.1194/jlr.R900010-JLR200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 16Chiang J.Y.L.

In the postabsorption phase, bile acids are absorbed from the intestine and are circulated back to the liver, where bile acids inhibit their own biosynthesis in a feedback regulatory loop. About 95% of bile acids are reabsorbed in the intestine and transported back to the liver. Such enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is instrumental for preventing bile acid overproduction, as abnormally higher bile acid concentrations in the liver can damage cell membranes, impair liver function, and cause cholestasis and cirrhosis (15Chiang J.Y.

These data have spawned the idea that insulin resistance may be a predisposing factor for the pathogenesis of cholelithiasis. However, this idea seems at variance with some clinical and preclinical studies. First, the risk of cholelithiasis becomes higher, despite the improvement of insulin sensitivity and remission of diabetes, in humans with morbid obesity and type 2 diabetes following bariatric surgery (34Li V.K.

Second, acute weight loss, derived from a low calorie diet regimen, is associated with an increased susceptibility to developing cholelithiasis, independently of insulin resistance (23Stokes C.S.

Third, ob/ob or db/db mice, despite their morbid obesity and severe insulin resistance, are refractory to developing gallstones (42Bouchard G. Johnson D. Carver T. Paigen B. Carey M.C. Cholesterol gallstone formation in overweight mice establishes that obesity per se is not linked directly to cholelithiasis risk.J.

These data highlight a significant gap of knowledge about the molecular basis that links obesity and insulin resistance to the pathogenesis of cholelithiasis. In this context, a preclinical study by Biddinger et al. (44Biddinger S.B. Haas J.T. Yu B.B. Bezy O. Jing E. Zhang W. Unterman T.G. Carey M.C. Kahn C.R. Hepatic insulin resistance directly promotes formation of cholesterol gallstones.Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (18587407): 778-78210.1038/nm1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) reports that hepatic insulin resistance directly promotes the formation of gallstones in mice, when fed a lithogenic diet (LD), a dietary regimen that is shown to stimulate gallstone formation in a number of animal models (45Holzbach R.T. Animal models of cholesterol gallstone disease.Hepatology. 1984; 4 (6479878): 191S-198S10.1002/hep.1840040836Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 46Wang T.Y. Portincasa P. Liu M. Tso P. Wang D.Q. Mouse models of gallstone disease.Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 2018; 34 (29266008): 59-7010.1097/MOG.0000000000000417Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). They show that mice with conditional insulin receptor (Ir) depletion in the liver develop gallstone disease, as result of genetically inherited insulin resistance in Ir-knockout mice (44Biddinger S.B. Haas J.T. Yu B.B. Bezy O. Jing E. Zhang W. Unterman T.G. Carey M.C. Kahn C.R. Hepatic insulin resistance directly promotes formation of cholesterol gallstones.Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (18587407): 778-78210.1038/nm1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the underlying mechanism connecting Ir deficiency to gallstone disease remains undefined. It is known that the forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) transcription factor acts downstream of the Ir signaling pathway to mediate the inhibitory action of insulin on target gene expression (47Accili D. Arden K.C. FoxOs at the crossroads of cellular metabolism, differentiation, and transformation.Cell. 2004; 117 (15137936): 421-42610.1016/S0092-8674(04)00452-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 48Barthel A. Schmoll D. Unterman T.G. FoxO proteins in insulin action and metabolism.Trends Endocrinol.

In the absence of insulin, FoxO1 is active in the nucleus, in which FoxO1 binds to target promoters and stimulates target gene expression (47Accili D. Arden K.C. FoxOs at the crossroads of cellular metabolism, differentiation, and transformation.Cell. 2004; 117 (15137936): 421-42610.1016/S0092-8674(04)00452-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 48Barthel A.

In response to insulin, FoxO1 undergoes Akt-dependent phosphorylation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (50Lee S. Dong H.H. FoxO integration of insulin signaling with glucose and lipid metabolism.J. Endocrinol. 2017; 233 (28213398): R67-R7910.1530/JOE-17-0002Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This effect accounts for insulin-dependent inactivation of FoxO1 activity. As a result of insulin resistance, hepatic FoxO1 activity becomes abnormally higher, because of the inability of FoxO1 to undergo Akt-dependent phosphorylation and translocation in obesity and type 2 diabetes (50Lee S. Dong H.H. FoxO integration of insulin signaling with glucose and lipid metabolism.J. Endocrinol. 2017; 233 (28213398): R67-R7910.1530/JOE-17-0002Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Likewise, genetic Ir depletion in the liver is expected to intercept insulin inhibition of FoxO1 activity, contributing to constitutive FoxO1 activity in insulin-resistant liver of Ir-knockout mice, although this point was not addressed in the study (44Biddinger S.B. Haas J.T. Yu B.B. Bezy O. Jing E. Zhang W. Unterman T.G. Carey M.C. Kahn C.R. Hepatic insulin resistance directly promotes formation of cholesterol gallstones.Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (18587407): 778-78210.1038/nm1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Together these data implicate FoxO1 at the interface of insulin resistance and gallstone disease, inspiring us to hypothesize that genetic FoxO1 depletion would protect against the development of cholelithiasis in mice. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice with conditional FoxO1 depletion in the liver, using the FoxO1LoxP/LoxP-Albumin-Cre system. Liver-conditional FoxO1-knockout mice versus age/sex-matched WT littermates were fed on LD, followed by the determination of the effect of hepatic FoxO1 depletion on bile acid metabolism and gallstone disease. To corroborate these studies, we developed a high fat–containing lithogenic diet (HFLD) with 60% fat content, as the low fat content (15% fat) in LD is inadequate to induce obesity (45Holzbach R.T. Animal models of cholesterol gallstone disease.Hepatology. 1984; 4 (6479878): 191S-198S10.1002/hep.1840040836Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 46Wang T.Y. Portincasa P. Liu M. Tso P. Wang D.Q. Mouse models of gallstone disease.Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 2018; 34 (29266008): 59-7010.1097/MOG.0000000000000417Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We replicated our studies by feeding liver-conditional FoxO1-knockout mice versus age/sex-matched WT littermates the newly customized HFLD to further test our hypothesis that FoxO1 deregulation, resulting from overnutrition and insulin resistance, is culpable for the pathogenesis of cholelithiasis in obesity. Fxr is a key regulator of bile acid homeostasis. Fxr-deficient mice are associated with increased susceptibility to developing cholesterol gallstone disease (21Moschetta A. Bookout A.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Prevention of cholesterol gallstone disease by FXR agonists in a mouse model.Nat. Med. 2004; 10 (15558057): 1352-135810.1038/nm1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Fxr is abundantly expressed in the liver and its hepatic expression is down-regulated in response to insulin deficiency or insulin resistance (51Duran-Sandoval D. Mautino G. Martin G. Percevault F. Barbier O. Fruchart J.C. Kuipers F. Staels B.

To understand the underlying mechanism, we determined hepatic regulation of Fxr expression by FoxO1, whose hepatic activity is reciprocally up-regulated in insulin-deficient and insulin-resistant states (47Accili D. Arden K.C. FoxOs at the crossroads of cellular metabolism, differentiation, and transformation.Cell. 2004; 117 (15137936): 421-42610.1016/S0092-8674(04)00452-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 48Barthel A.

Arkansas was compared to states that expanded without a waiver in calendar year 2014. States that expanded Medicaid with an approved Section 1115 waiver during the study period or expanded without a waiver after 2014 or did not expand Medicaid were excluded from the analysis. The outcome measures were no health insurance coverage, Medicaid coverage, employer sponsored private insurance, and non-group direct purchase private insurance.Arkansas's use of a waiver to expand Medicaid was associated with a lower uninsured rate (-3.7%, p< 0.001), a higher Medicaid coverage rate (2.0%, p< 0.001), and a higher non-group, direct purchase private insurance coverage rate (2.9%, p< 0.001) compared to states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 without a waiver.Compared to states that implemented traditional Medicaid expansion, we found that Arkansas's waiver was associated with increases in health insurance coverage rates."

While the causes of food refusal are very different, the result is often malnutrition, which is linked to health comorbidities and a high mortality rate. However, the professionals lack the time and knowledge to clarify the cause for each patient. What associations do health professionals have when faced with food refusal?To investigate the associations that health professionals in oncological and palliative settings have about denied eating behavior.A cross-sectional study, starting with an open question focusing professionals' associations regarding food refusal. The results were inductively analyzed, whereby generic categories were developed. Subsequently, the categories were transformed into quantitative data to calculate the relationships between the categories.A total of 350 out of 2000 participants completed the survey, resulting in a response rate of 17.5%. Food refusal is primarily associated with physical and ethical aspects and with end-of-life. Half of the participants frequently find that patients refuse to eat. The attitudes show that the autonomy of the patient is the highest good and is to be respected. Even in the case of patients with limited decision-making capacity, the refusal to eat is acceptable.Clarifying the cause of food refusal requires a great deal of knowledge and is strongly influenced by the associations of health professionals. While the associations have very negative connotations, information and training is needed to make professionals aware of this and to change their associations. With this knowledge and in an interprofessional cooperation, mis-labelling of patient settings can be avoided and fears can be reduced."
