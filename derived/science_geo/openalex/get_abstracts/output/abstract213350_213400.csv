https://openalex.org/W2072456156,"INSECTICIDES are commonly used for control of soil insects, but little is known about the factors influencing insecticide activity in soil. In the few investigations reported, emphasis has been placed on insecticides in the chlorinated hydrocarbon group. It has been established that DDT, γ-BHC, and dieldrin are inactivated by dry clay soils1–3, and that under conditions of high relative humidity reactivation occurs3,4. Barlow and Hadaway3 have suggested that insecticide inactivation on dry mud surfaces results from the physical phenomenon of adsorption, and that reactivation under conditions of high relative humidity occurs because the insecticide particles are unable to compete with water for the adsorptive surfaces on the soil particles. Other investigators5–7 have noted that insecticides are also inactivated in soils high in organic matter. The mechanism of inactivation by the organic fraction is not clear, but Roberts7 recently concluded that dieldrin is adsorbed by the organic fraction of the soil. This communication summarizes preliminary results obtained in a comprehensive investigation, now in progress at this laboratory, to determine the influence of soil type and soil moisture on the activity of both chlorinated hydrocarbon and organophosphate insecticides applied to soil for insect control."

https://openalex.org/W2072939948,"PROGRESSIVE fatal neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, occur with exceptionally high incidence in the indigenous population of Guam and the other Mariana Islands in the Western Pacific. Recent investigations indicate that these neurological problems are not limited to the Chamorros, the indigenous population of the Marianas1,2. Since extensive pedigree and epidemiological data revealed no single genetic defect which might reasonably account for such abnormalities, ancestral relationships among different aboriginal populations of the Western Pacific are being examined. If the ancestry of these groups can be defined in terms of several common genetic markers, then a comparison of the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinsonism-dementia or other neurological diseases occurring within these groups might facilitate the separation of genetic and non-genetic disease-producing factors. This communication reports the results of a preliminary survey for three sex-linked traits: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency, red-green colour blindness and Xga blood-group in Chamorro males. The results are summarized in Table 1."
https://openalex.org/W1964931506,"THE work of Beutler1 on erythrocyte glutathione ‘instability’ has demonstrated the significance of the glutathione content of red cells for the maintenance of overall erythrocyte structure (and presumably function). In addition, Rigas et al.2 have shown how the interaction of hæmoglobin and oxidized glutathione can lead to increased rates of splenic erythrocyte destruction. A number of disease states have been related to increased instability of erythrocyte glutathione; for example, Theil et al.3 have shown a significant decrease of blood glutathione-levels in patients with acute renal insufficiency."

https://openalex.org/W2033688725,"IN their recent article in Nature1, on “A New Species of the genus Homo from Olduvai Gorge”, L. S. B. Leakey, P. V. Tobias and J. R. Napier refer to the specimens (from Swartkrans, Transvaal) originally described by Broom and Robinson (1949) as Telanthropus capensis but later referred by Robinson (1961) to Homo erectus Dubois sp. (1894). Leakey et al. give as their opinion that T. capensis “may well prove, on closer comparative investigation, to belong to Homo habilis”. However, if the Olduvai hominid proved to be conspecific with the Swartkrans form, the name capensis would have priority over habilis, not vice versa. Similarly, should the new hominid be conspecific with the Kanam mandible (which we think unlikely), the specific name kanamensis Leakey, 1935, would have priority."
https://openalex.org/W2079205961,"IT has been found that a recently isolated strain of Acetobacter caused yeasts to die when both organisms were present in a nutrient medium in full screw-capped bottles. In a typical test full McCartney bottles of beer were inoculated with 5 × 105 cells per ml. of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and amounts of a suspension of a washed culture of Acetobacter were added to different bottles to give counts of from 0 to 50 × 105 cells per ml. The numbers of viable yeasts were determined daily by methylene blue staining during incubation at 25°, with the results shown in Fig. 1."

https://openalex.org/W2058999187,"ANION exchange resins have been used to separate organic and inorganic iodine compounds from thyroid extracts and from serum by various workers1–4. Organic iodine compounds are relatively easily eluted from resins of this type, but it has proved difficult to recover the iodide. Attempts have been made to do this with sodium bromide by Galton and Pitt-Rivers1 and with sodium sulphate by Sekino et al.5."
https://openalex.org/W1969790375,"THE fluorescence seen transiently in feathers of the whole chick embryo after administration of tetracycline1 and noted regularly in sectioned hair from guinea pigs treated for examination of growth of bone2 led to a specific investigation of the binding of tetracycline in keratin. The working hypothesis in this investigation assumed relationships among the collagen-type structure proposed for feather keratin3, the calcification observed in certain keratins4, the necessity for the presence of both collagen and calcium in tetracycline binding5 and tetracycline deposition in the pattern of calcium distribution in secondary mineralization and long-term exchange6."

https://openalex.org/W1998609336,"THE production of chromosome aberrations by X-rays is now a standard procedure. Certain types of treatment of the cells prior to or during the irradiation may, however, have a modifying effect. The number of chromosome aberrations is decreased with anoxic conditions1; increasing temperature and a constant partial pressure of oxygen2; a prior treatment to liquid air3; and a heat shock of about 80° C for 0.5 h before irradiation4. Treatment with such chemicals as glutathione, cysteine, sodium hyposulphite5, and BAL (2,3-dimercaptopropanol)6 has also reduced the number of chromosome aberrations. The purpose of the work recorded here was to determine if certain radio-protective chemicals would influence genetic recombination as determined by the frequency of second division segregation. These chemicals are cysteine, thiourea, and cystamine."

https://openalex.org/W2049898715,"IT was shown by Kapsenberg1 and Heller and Salenstedt2 that infectious canine hepatitis virus (ICH) and adenoviruses possessed common complement fixing antigens. Heller and Salenstedt2 demonstrated five precipitin lines in Ouchterlony plates in the reaction between ICH and convalescent serum from a dog infected with ICH. Three of the antigens forming these precipitin lines were common to adenovirus type 7 which itself gave five precipitin lines with human anti-adenovirus type 7 convalescent serum. The immunological relationship between the two viruses was one-sided, as anti-adenovirus type 7 serum would react in Ouchterlony plates with ICH, but anti-ICH would not react with adenovirus type 7. Recently, Darbyshire and Pereira3 have demonstrated two antigens in the livers of ICH infected dogs which can be precipitated with dog anti-ICH. One of these antigens is precipitated by rabbit anti-adenovirus type 5 serum. In the experiments reported here it was found that ICH infected dog kidney cultures produced only two soluble viral antigens, one of which is closely similar to the A (group specific) antigen of adenoviruses types 5 and 7 and another which is specific for ICH."

https://openalex.org/W2064066858,"RECENTLY we carried out an experiment at the National Lending Library for Science and Technology, the results of which may be of interest to all concerned with the training of research students. We invited three groups, each of about 20 postgraduate research students, to the Library for a fortnight. While they were at the Library, we arranged a few seminars on the use of scientific literature, provided appropriately qualified ‘tutors’ to guide them in tracking down references related to their research projects and made the resources of the Library available."

https://openalex.org/W2085410883,"URINE from patients homozygous for hereditary atypical serum cholinesterase (HASC) and from normals (mainly laboratory personnel) was collected and refrigerated immediately. The cholinesterase genotype, as shown in Table 1, was determined by reported methods1,2 on blood specimens drawn at the same time. The urine was lyophilized and reconstituted with distilled water to one-fifth the original volume. The concentrates were extracted by a slight modification of the method of Biran and Bartley3, as shown in Fig. 1."
https://openalex.org/W2059247772,"SINCE it has been suggested by Brown et al.1 that ‘cyclonueleoside’ might be involved in the pathway of transformation of ribonucleoside to deoxyribonucleoside in the living cell, several investigators have reported2,3 the results of experiments to elucidate whether cyclonucleoside did or did not participate in this transformation. Whereas in these investigations no direct evidence for participation of cyclonucleoside was obtained, the possibility of involvement of cyclonucleoside phosphates4 in this reaction remained unsolved."
https://openalex.org/W2086437653,"DURING the investigation of plasma of laying hens, it was found necessary to obtain samples of approximately 0.03 ml. from large numbers of birds, and also from the same bird at frequent intervals. A technique was developed, in which centrifugation of the blood, to separate the cells from the plasma, was performed in the collection tubes. Transferring the blood is thereby avoided, and the plasma is obtained almost quantitatively."
