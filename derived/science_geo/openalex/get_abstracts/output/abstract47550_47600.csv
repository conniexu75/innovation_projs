https://openalex.org/W1496795801,"Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein (BP) has been purified from Cohn fraction IV of human plasma by acidification, ion exchange to remove endogenous ligands, and affinity chromatography on agarose-IGF-II. The pure protein appeared as a single peak by high performance reverse-phase and gel permeation chromatography (molecular mass, 45-50 kDa), but on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a major band at 53 kDa and a minor band at 47 kDa, unreduced, or 43 and 40 kDa, respectively, reduced. The two bands stained for both protein and carbohydrate. After storage at 2 degrees C for 5 months at pH 3, two additional bands, at 26 and 22 kDa on unreduced gels, were also present. Autoradiography after affinity labeling with IGF-I or IGF-II tracer revealed a single labeled band of 61 kDa. BP, quantitated using a specific radioimmunoassay, was retained by agarose-immobilized IGF-I, IGF-II, concanavalin A, and wheat germ lectin, but not Helix pomatia lectin. Competitive binding curves using pure BP and human IGF-I and IGF-II as both labeled and unlabeled ligands indicated association constants of 2-3 X 10(10) liters/mol for both peptides, with a slightly higher affinity for IGF-II than IGF-I, and 0.9 binding sites for either peptide per 53-kDa protein. The exact relationship of this acid-stable IGF BP to the 150-kDa complex from which it is derived remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1540771766,"The Ca2+(calmodulin (CaM))-dependent protein kinase II, purified from either rabbit liver or rat brain, was preincubated under conditions that are known to promote its autophosphorylation. When kinase activity was assayed after this preincubation, it was observed that excess EGTA could block no more than 40-60% of the total Ca2+- and CaM-dependent activity compared to 95% inhibition by EGTA prior to preincubation. In the EGTA assay, free Ca2+ was calculated to be less than 1 nM; therefore, this activity was designated Ca2+-independent activity. Formation of this Ca2+-independent form of the kinase was shown to be associated with autophosphorylation based on the following observations: (a) it required the presence of Ca2+, CaM, and ATP; (b) the ATP analogs adenylyl imidodiphosphate and adenylyl methylenediphosphate could not substitute for ATP; (c) generation of the independent form was associated with incorporation of phosphate into the kinase; and (d) addition of protein phosphatase partially dephosphorylated the kinase and restored its Ca2+ dependence. This phenomenon may be of physiological importance because it would prolong the effects of extracellular signals that only transiently increase the intracellular Ca2+ level."
https://openalex.org/W1535244363,"We describe effects of serum insufficiency and cell contact on the transcription and abundance of the c-myc proto-oncogene mRNA in BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts. In exponentially growing cells, withdrawal of serum caused a 10-fold decline in c-myc mRNA within 90 min. At least part of this decline was due to a decrease in the level of myc gene transcription. These cells became quiescent at subconfluence after 36-40 h. Cells made quiescent at subconfluence or confluence contained low levels of c-myc mRNA which rose more than 20-fold 2 h after stimulation of growth by fresh serum. Thereafter, the mRNA level declined. In subconfluent cells, it declined to the level in exponentially growing cells, i.e. nearly 10-fold over the level in quiescent cells. In confluent cells, by contrast, the mRNA returned to near-quiescent levels within 18 h (by mid-S phase). However, c-myc gene transcription was regulated identically in subconfluent and confluent cultures; quiescent cells transcribed c-myc at detectable levels, and stimulation by serum caused a 5-fold increase in 1 h, followed by a decline to about 2-fold over the quiescent level within 18 h. Thus, confluence affected steady state mRNA levels without affecting the level of transcription. Our results suggest that extracellular conditions that modulate cell proliferation (serum and cell contact) exert strong and rapid control over c-myc mRNA by post-transcriptional and transcriptional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1561980328,"The Ca2+-ryanodine receptor complex is solubilized in functional form on treating sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles from rabbit fast skeletal muscle with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS) (1 mg/mg protein) and 1 M NaCl at pH 7.1 by shaking for 30 min at 5 degrees C. The heavy membrane preparations obtained from pyrophosphate homogenates frequently exhibit junctional feet and appear to be derived primarily from the terminal cisternae of the SR. The characteristics of [3H]ryanodine binding are similar for the soluble receptor and the heavy SR vesicles with respect to dependence on Ca2+, pharmacological specificity for inhibition by six ryanoids and ruthenium red, and lack of sensitivity to voltage-dependent Ca2+-channel blockers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, or doxorubicin. In contrast, the cation sensitivity is decreased on receptor solubilization. The soluble receptor is modulated by cyclic nucleotides and rapidly denatured at 50 degrees C. Saturation experiments reveal a single class of receptors (Kd = 9.6 nM), whereas kinetic measurements yield a calculated association constant of 5.5 X 10(6) min-1 M-1 and a dissociation constant of 5.7 X 10(-4) min-1, suggesting that the [3H]ryanodine receptor complex ages with time to a state which is recalcitrant to dissociation. Sepharose chromatography shows that the receptor complex consists primarily of two protein fractions, one of apparent Mr 150,000-300,000 and a second, the [3H]ryanodine binding component, of approximately Mr 1.2 X 10(6). Preliminary analysis of the soluble receptor preparation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals subunits of Mr greater than 200,000 and major bands of calsequestrin and Ca2+-transport ATPase. These findings indicate that [3H]ryanodine binds to the Ca2+-induced open state of the channel involved in the release of contractile Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1586997294,"Flow dialysis measurements of calcium binding to bovine brain S100 alpha alpha, S100a (alpha beta), and S100b (beta beta) proteins in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5 and 8.3 revealed that S100 proteins bind specifically 4 Ca2+ eq/mol of protein dimer. The specific calcium-binding sites had, therefore, been assigned to typical amino acid sequences on the alpha and beta subunit. The protein affinity for calcium is much lower in the presence of magnesium and potassium. Potassium strongly antagonizes calcium binding on two calcium-binding sites responsible for most of the Ca2+-induced conformational changes on S100 proteins (probably site II alpha and site II beta). Zinc-binding studies in the absence of divalent cations revealed eight zinc-binding sites/mol of S100b protein dimer that we assumed to correspond to 4 zinc-binding sites/beta subunit. Zinc binding to S100b studied with UV spectroscopy methods showed that the occupation of the four higher affinity sites and the four lower affinity sites on the protein dimer were responsible for different conformational changes in S100b structure. Zinc binding on the higher affinity sites regulates calcium binding to S100b by increasing the protein affinity for calcium and decreasing the antagonistic effect of potassium on calcium binding. Zinc-binding studies on S100a and S100 alpha alpha protein showed that the Trp-containing S100 proteins bind zinc more weakly than S100b protein. Calcium-binding studies on zinc-bound S100a proved that calcium- and zinc-binding sites were distinct although there was no increase in zinc-bound S100a affinity for calcium, as in S100b protein. Finally we provide evidence that discrepancies between previously published results on the optical properties of S100b protein probably result from oxidation of the sulfhydryl groups in the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1509427554,"Myogenesis is accompanied by the withdrawal of proliferating myoblasts from the cell cycle, their fusion to form myotubes, and the coordinate expression of a variety of muscle-specific gene products, such as the muscle isoenzyme of creatine kinase (MCK). In the present study we used the nonfusing muscle cell line, BC3H1, to examine the mechanisms involved in regulation of MCK mRNA expression. Proliferating BC3H1 cells, in media with 20% fetal calf serum, had undetectable levels of MCK mRNA. Exposure of undifferentiated cells to media containing 0.5% serum resulted in withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle and in a several hundred-fold increase in the steady state level of MCK mRNA. Induction of this muscle-specific mRNA could be rapidly reversed by exposure of quiescent differentiated cells to media containing either 20% serum or pituitary fibroblast growth factor. The decline in the steady state level of MCK mRNA following mitogenic stimulation was not dependent upon reentry of cells into the cell cycle, but it did require protein synthesis. Together, these data indicate that fibroblast growth factor can specifically inhibit muscle-specific gene expression through a mechanism independent of cell proliferation. The finding that MCK mRNA was down-regulated by a mechanism that required protein synthesis suggests that mitogen-inducible early gene products may be involved in regulation of muscle gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1595123479,"The distribution of cholesterol between vesicles of different lipid composition at equilibrium has been determined. Small, sonicated unilamellar vesicles and large unilamellar vesicles were incubated at a defined temperature, and aliquots were then obtained at selected times for analysis. Inclusion of a small amount of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylinositol in the membrane does not appreciably affect the distribution of cholesterol at equilibrium by these measurements. A membrane in the gel state is a poor acceptor of cholesterol. The length of the hydrocarbon chain on the phospholipid may also play a role. Bovine brain sphingomyelin dramatically slows the kinetics of cholesterol transfer, and the equilibrium distribution of cholesterol among vesicles containing sphingomyelin is therefore not observable in these experiments. Data obtained with vesicles containing phosphatidylethanolamine indicate a preference of cholesterol for vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine compared to vesicles consisting primarily of phosphatidylethanolamine, at equilibrium. Experiments with a chaotropic agent indicate that the nature of the surface of the phosphatidylethanolamine bilayer, and its hydration, are important factors in the distribution of cholesterol among membranes in which phosphatidylethanolamine is present. These data suggest that membrane lipid content may play a role in the distribution of cholesterol among the membranes of a cell."
https://openalex.org/W1672932894,"A new ganglioside containing an inner ester linkage was extracted from adult brain specimens, obtained at the time of surgery on 51-70-year-old subjects, purified, and analyzed. It contains glucose, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, an N-acetylneuraminic acid in the molar ratio 1:2:1:2, but, on ion-exchange chromatography, behaves as a monosialoganglioside. Structural analyses showed its basic neutral glycosphingolipid core to be ganglio-N-tetraose ceramide, carrying a disialosyl residue on the 3-position of internal galactose. Sialidase degradation and chemical analysis of the products obtained after alkaline treatments suggested one sialic acid residue to be involved in an ester linkage. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry indicated the presence of an inner ester linkage between the carboxyl group of the external sialic acid residue and a hydroxyl group of the internal one. On these bases, the new ganglioside can be assumed to be a GD1b in lactonic form. This ganglioside is present only in trace amounts in the brain of infants, but its content increases with age, reaching a value of 3.5% of total sialic acid in 51-70-year-old subjects."
https://openalex.org/W1521965196,"We have previously proposed a chlorogenic acid biosynthetic pathway which involves a transesterification reaction between hydroxycinnamoyl D-glucose and D-quinic acid. The proposed pathway was based on tracer experimental results (Kojima, M., and Uritani, I. (1972) Plant Cell Physiol. 13, 311-319). The enzyme that catalyzes the above reaction has been purified 160-fold from sweet potato root (Ipomoea batatas Lam.) and characterized. The purified enzyme yielded one band of 26,000 daltons on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its molecular weight was estimated to be 25,000 by gel filtration chromatography. Therefore, the enzyme seems to consist of a single polypeptide of 25,000-26,000 daltons. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was 8.6. The optimum pH of the enzyme reaction was 6.0. The enzyme did not require any metal for activity and showed a broad substrate specificity toward hydroxycinnamoyl D-glucose as donors. The Km and Vmax values were 3.7 mM and 8.5 units/mg of protein for t-cinnamoyl D-glucose, 3.9 mM and 15.1 units/mg of protein for p-coumaroyl D-glucose, and 14.3 mM and 38.1 units/mg of protein for caffeoyl D-glucose. The enzyme showed a strict substrate specificity toward D-quinic acid-related compounds as acceptors; the Km and Vmax values were 16.7 mM and 15.1 units/mg of protein for D-quinic acid, 250 mM and 19.0 units/mg of protein for shikimic acid, and there was no activity with either L-malic acid or meso-tartaric acid. The enzyme activity changed in a manner suggesting its involvement in chlorogenic acid biosynthesis during incubation of sliced sweet potato root tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1523963881,"An early form of procollagen I was found in acetic acid extracts of radioactively labeled chick embryo skull bones. It resembled native procollagen I, but sedimented slightly faster, and its component chains were slightly underhydroxylated and were not disulfide-linked to each other, although its propeptides were internally disulfide-bonded. Pulse-chase experiments showed its conversion to disulfide-linked procollagen. As the same conversion occurred when proline hydroxylation was blocked by 2,2'-dipyridyl, we infer that the formation of this precursor from its component chains does not require collagen triple helix formation. We suggest that interaction between the folded carboxyl propeptides of individual pro-alpha (I) chains is an important step in the formation of this precursor and of procollagen I. Studies of the refolding and association of fully reduced and denatured carboxyl propeptides supported this concept. In the presence of glutathione the correct disulfide bonds could be reestablished, as judged by a mapping of some tryptic peptides. Individual carboxyl propeptides refolded first, and this occurred even in 2 M urea. Recognition between folded carboxyl propeptides occurred only when less than 0.5 M urea was present. The presence of the carboxyl telopeptides was important for trimeric reassembly. Individual propeptides also folded spontaneously during cell-free translation of pro-alpha (I) chains and were recognized by specific antibodies. We consider the role of carboxyl propeptides in the formation of procollagen I molecules and suggest a model of self-assembly, possibly facilitated by interactions with the luminal surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1526609551,"We have used resonance Raman spectroscopy and isotopic labeling techniques to unambiguously assign the dioxygen stretching frequency (vo-o) in the substrate-bound oxygenated complex of cytochrome P-450cam. The frequency found for Vo-o in the P-450cam system (1140 cm-1) is in remarkable agreement with recent studies of thiolate heme model compounds. The general features of the oxy-P-450cam Raman spectra are tabulated and comparisons are made with the oxy complexes of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various model compounds. Most of the results are qualitatively explained by consideration of electron donation into the pi g (O2)/d pi (M) orbitals of the oxygenated complex (M = Fe or Co). It is also noted that the effect of the extra electron in the nitrogen base Co(II) oxy complexes, in some ways, parallels the effect of the lone pair electrons of thiolate in the oxy-P-450cam complex. This is evidenced by the enhanced resonance Raman activity of vo-o in both the Co(II) and P-450 systems as well as by the similarity of the vo-o frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W1587692148,"Abstract We have investigated the effects of the binding of various metal ions to cation-free bacteriorhodopsin membrane). The following have been measured: shift of the absorption maximum from 603 to 558 nm (blue to purple transition), binding isotherms, the release of H+ upon binding, and the decay of the deprotonated intermediate of the photocycle, M412. We find that all cations of the lanthanide series, as well as the alkali and alkali earth metals earlier investigated, are able to bring about the absorption shift, whereas Hg2+ and Pt4+ are not. Sigmoidal spectroscopic titration curves and nonsigmoidal binding curves suggest that there are two high affinity sites for cations in bacteriorhodopsin. Binding to the site with the second highest affinity is responsible for the absorption shift. Divalent cation binding to blue membrane causes release of about six protons, whereas higher numbers of protons are released by trivalent cations, suggesting that the shift of absorption maximum involves proton release from carboxyl group(s). The metal ion bound to this site must be surrounded by carboxyl oxygen atoms acting together as a multidentate ligand with a specific geometry because multivalent ions are effective only when capable of octahedral coordination. Lanthanide ions dramatically inhibit M412 decay at pH above 6.3, an effect probably due to binding to lipid phosphoryl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1555538371,"The effects of ketoconazole, a lanosterol demethylase and cytochrome P450 inhibitor, on the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34, reductase) activity and sterol biosynthesis were studied in rat intestinal epithelial cell cultures (IEC-6). Incubation of cells with 0.15-2 microM ketoconazole resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of reductase activity. As the drug concentration approached 15 microM, the reductase activity returned to control values, and at 30 microM ketoconazole, a stimulation of enzyme activity was observed. The drug had no effect on reductase activity in homogenates of IEC-6 cells. Ketoconazole (0.15-30 microM) caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the incorporation of [3H] mevalonolactone into cholesterol with a concomitant accumulation of radioactivity in methyl sterols; e.g. lanosterol and 24,25-epoxylanosterol. Interestingly, the incorporation of radioactivity into polar sterols showed a biphasic response which was inversely proportional to the biphasic response of reductase activity. Thus, incorporation of [3H]mevalonolactone into polar sterols increased at low concentrations of ketoconazole (0.15-2 microM) and decreased to control values at high concentrations of the drug. Treatment of cells with ketoconazole (30 microM) and [3H]mevalonolactone followed by removal of the drug and radiolabel resulted in an inhibition of reductase activity and a redistribution of radioactivity from lanosterol and 24,25-epoxylanosterol to cholesterol and polar sterols. These results suggested that the inhibition of reductase activity at low concentrations of ketoconazole (less than 2 microM) was due to a formation of regulatory polar sterols generated from the methyl sterols. At high concentrations of ketoconazole (30 microM) where no suppression in reductase activity was observed, the conversion of exogenously added [3H]24(S),25-epoxylanosterol to polar sterols was prevented. Exogenously added 24,25-epoxylanosterol inhibited reductase activity in a dose-dependent fashion, and ketoconazole (30 microM) prevented the inhibition caused by low concentrations of epoxylanosterol. The drug, however, was unable to prevent the dose-dependent suppression of reductase activity by 25-hydroxylanosterol, a reduced form of 24,25-epoxylanosterol. These results indicated that 24,25-epoxylanosterol per se was not an inhibitor of reductase activity but could be metabolized to regulatory polar sterols through a cytochrome P-450 dependent reaction which was sensitive to ketoconazole. Treatment of cells with ketoconazole totally abolished the inhibition of reductase activity by low density lipoprotein (LDL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1522010057,"The roles of alkaline phosphatase and labile internal mineral in matrix vesicle-mediated mineralization have been studied by selectively releasing the enzyme from a wide variety of matrix vesicle preparations using treatment with a bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and by demineralization of the vesicles using isosmotic pH 6 buffer. Following depletion of 50-90% of the alkaline phosphatase activity or treatment with citrate buffer, the vesicles were tested for their ability to accumulate 45Ca2+ and 32Pi from a synthetic cartilage lymph. Removal of alkaline phosphatase by phospholipase C treatment caused two principal effects, depending on the matrix vesicle preparation. In rapidly mineralizing vesicle fractions which did not require organic phosphate esters (Po) to accumulate mineral ions, release of alkaline phosphatase had only a minor effect. In slowly mineralizing vesicles preparations or those dependent on Po substrates for mineral ion uptake, release of alkaline phosphatase caused significant loss of mineralizing activity. The activity of rapidly calcifying vesicles was shown to be dependent on the presence of labile internal mineral, as demonstrated by major loss in activity when the vesicles were decalcified by various treatments. Ion uptake by demineralized vesicles or those fractionated on sucrose step gradients required Po and was significantly decreased by alkaline phosphatase depletion. Uptake of Pi, however, was not coupled with hydrolysis of the Po substrate. These findings argue against a direct role for alkaline phosphatase as a porter in matrix vesicle Pi uptake, contrary to previous postulates. The results emphasize the importance of internal labile mineral in rapid uptake of mineral ions by matrix vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W109442298,"Scatchard analysis of equilibrium dialysis studies have revealed that in the presence of 3.0 mM MgCl2 and 150 mM KCl, calregulin has a single binding site for Ca2+ with an apparent dissociation constant (apparent Kd) of 0.05 microM and 14 binding sites for Zn2+ with apparent Kd(Zn2+) of 310 microM. Ca2+ binding to calregulin induces a 5% increase in the intensity of intrinsic fluorescence and a 2-3-nm blue shift in emission maximum. Zn2+ binding to calregulin causes a dose-dependent increase of about 250% in its intrinsic fluorescence intensity and a red shift in the emission maximum of about 11 nm. Half-maximal wavelength shift occurs at 0.4 mol of Zn2+/mol of calregulin, and 100% of the wavelength shift is complete at 2 mol of Zn2+/mol of calregulin. In the presence of Zn2+ and calregulin the fluorescence intensity of the hydrophobic fluorescent probe 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulfonate (ANS) was enhanced 300-400% with a shift in emission maximum from 500 to 480 nm. Half-maximal Zn2+-induced shift in ANS emission maximum occurred at 1.2 mol of Zn2+/mol of calregulin, and 100% of this shift occurred at 6 mol of Zn2+/mol of calregulin. Of 12 cations tested, only Zn2+ and Ca2+ produced changes in calregulin intrinsic fluorescence, and none of these metal ions could inhibit the Zn2+-induced red shift in intrinsic fluorescence emission maximum. Furthermore, none of these cations could inhibit or mimic the Zn2+-induced blue shift in ANS emission maximum. These results suggest that calregulin contains distinct and specific ligand-binding sites for Ca2+ and Zn2+. While Ca2+ binding results in the movement of tryptophan away from the solvent, Zn2+ causes a movement of tryptophan into the solvent and the exposure of a domain with considerable hydrophobic character."
https://openalex.org/W1572492375,"Some divalent (Cd2+, Sr2+, Ba2+) and lanthanide (Ln3+) ions can be substituted for endogenous Ca2+ of horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Ca2+-bound hemoenzyme) and maintain the protein structure in the heme vicinity as well as the enzymatic activity of HRP, as does Ca2+. However, due to lower affinity than Ca2+, the bound Ln3+ was readily replaced by Ca2+ to yield native HRP, in sharp contrast to other typical Ca2+-binding proteins, of which the affinity to Ln3+ is higher than to Ca2+. Addition of paramagnetic Ln3+ to Ca2+-free HRP induced a series of paramagnetically shifted 1H NMR resonances of protein at the first metal binding site in HRP. The pH-dependent spectral changes of the Ln3+-shifted resonances suggest that tyrosyl hydroxyl and glutamate and aspartate carboxyl groups are involved in the binding site of the Ca2+, other divalent ions, or Ln3+. The 113Cd NMR spectra of 113Cd2+-bound HRP also indicated the presence of one metal strongly bound to the oxygen ligands and another site with low affinity for the metal ions, which is consistent with the results from the Ln3+-induced proton NMR. All these results suggest that the binding of one metal ion to HRP is essential for its structural and functional properties."
https://openalex.org/W1547594766,"Recent studies report that the frictional resistance of partially acetylated core particles increases when the number of acetyl groups/particle exceeds 10 (Bode, J., Gomez-Lira, M. M. & Schroter, H. (1983) Eur. J. Biochem. 130, 437-445). This was attributed to an opening of the core particle though other explanations, e.g. unwinding of the DNA ends were also suggested. Another possible explanation is that release of the core histone N-terminal domains by acetylation increased the frictional resistance of the particle. Neutron scatter studies have been performed on core particles acetylated to different levels up to 2.4 acetates/H4 molecule. Up to this level of acetylation the neutron scatter data show no evidence for unfolding of the core particle. The fundamental scatter functions for the envelope shape and internal structure are identical to those obtained previously for bulk core particles. The structure that gave the best fit to these fundamental scatter functions was a flat disc of diameter 11-11.5 nm and of thickness 5.5-6 nm with 1.7 +/- 0.2 turns of DNA coiled with a pitch of 3.0 nm around a core of the histone octamer. The data analysis emphasizes the changes in pair distance distribution functions at relatively low contrasts, particularly when the protein is contrast matched and DNA dominates the scatter. Under these conditions there is no evidence for the unwinding of long DNA ends in the hyperacetylated core particles. The distance distribution functions go to zero between 11.5 and 12 nm which gives the maximum chord length in a particle of dimension, 11 nm X 5.5 nm. The distance distribution function for the histone octamer contains 85% of the vectors within the 7.0-nm diameter of the histone core. 15% of the histone vectors lie between 7.0 and 12.0 nm, and these are attributed to the N-terminal domains of the core histones which extend out from the central histone core. Histone vectors extending beyond 7.0 nm are necessary to account for the measured radius of gyration of the histone core of 3.3 nm. A similar value of 3.2 nm is calculated for the recent ellipsoidal shape of 11.0 X 6.5 X 6.5 nm from the crystal structure of the octamer. However, the nucleosome model based on this structure is globular, roughly 11 nm in diameter, which does not accord with the flat disc shape core particle obtained from detailed neutron scatter data nor with the cross-section radii of gyration of the histone and DNA found previously for extended chromatin in solution."
https://openalex.org/W2262865586,"We used fluorescence non-radiative energy transfer to measure the self-association of melittin in solution and when bound to lipid bilayers. Energy transfer occurred from the tryptophan residue of unlabeled melittin to an N-methyl anthraniloyl residue covalently bound to a basic lysine residue on melittin. The extent of energy transfer from tryptophan to the label was found to increase severalfold upon the salt-induced tetramerization of melittin. When bound to vesicles of dimyristoyl-L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine, the extent of energy transfer was found to be equivalent to that of monomeric melittin, irrespective of the presence of monomeric or tetrameric melittin in the aqueous phase. We conclude that membrane-bound melittin is monomeric."
https://openalex.org/W1544089362,"In the fasted to fed transition liver glycogen derives mainly from gluconeogenic precursors. Why glucose is not used efficiently as a direct precursor of glycogen has become a controversial issue, in part because of disagreement over the question of how well liver can phosphorylate glucose under conditions prevailing postprandially. To try to resolve the matter the relative merits of two recently described assays, one spectrophotometric (A), the other isotopic (B), for monitoring rates of glucose phosphorylation in the high speed supernatant fraction of liver have been rigorously evaluated. A third method, also isotopic (C), was developed for use with unfractionated as well as fractionated liver homogenates. Using fasted rats and mice from different nutritional backgrounds the glucose-phosphorylating capacity of liver extracts was measured and compared with rates of hepatic glycogen synthesis observed during refeeding. Two of the assays (A and C) provided reliable data at all concentrations of glucose tested (5-100 mM), while method B exhibited shortcomings at lower substrate concentrations. The results clearly establish that in both rats and mice the ability of the liver to phosphorylate glucose at physiological concentrations is sufficient to support only 25-30% of postprandial glycogen synthesis. A limited capacity for glucose phosphorylation probably accounts for the fact that two-thirds of glycogen synthesized with refeeding after a fast is formed by the indirect (gluconeogenic) pathway."

We reported the amino acid sequences of chains I, IIB, and IIC previously (Suzuki, T., Yasunaga, H., Furukohri, T., Nakamura, K., and Gotoh, T. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11481-11487). The sequence of chain IIA has now been determined. Chain IIA consists of 146 amino acid residues with a heme group and has a molecular weight of 17,236. All of the constituent chains of Tylorrhynchus hemoglobin appear to be homologous with those of vertebrate hemoglobins and contain heme. Distal (E7) His, distal (E11) Val, and proximal (F8) His are all conserved in the four chains. Phylogenetically, chain IIA appears more closely related to the monomeric chain I than to either of the other trimeric chains IIB and IIC. This is the first giant extracellular hemoglobin to be sequenced completely."

The conformation of S100 alpha alpha in the metal-free forms as well as in the presence of calcium were studied by UV absorption, circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, sulfhydryl reactivity, and interaction with a hydrophobic fluorescent probe. The alpha-subunit appears to have nearly identical conformation in S100 alpha alpha and S100a protein dimers. We also confirmed that only the alpha-subunit exposes hydrophobic domains to solvent in the presence of calcium and that cysteine residues exposed upon Ca2+ binding to S100 proteins correspond to Cys 85 alpha and Cys 84 beta. Incubation of S100a with calcium and KCl proved that calcium binding to the putative calcium-binding sites (site I alpha, I beta) triggers a time- and temperature-dependent conformational change in the protein structure which decreases the antagonistic effect of KCl on calcium binding to sites II alpha and II beta and provokes subunit exchanges between protein dimers and the emergence of S100 alpha alpha and S100b (beta beta) proteins. Dynamic fluorescence measurements showed that incubating calcium at high S100a protein concentrations (greater than 10(-5) M) induces an apparent slow dimer-monomer equilibrium which might result in total subunit dissociation at lower protein concentrations. The effect of acidic pH on subunit dissociation in S100a protein (Morero, R. D., and Weber, G. (1982) Biochim. Biophys.

An early step in the reaction is the production of a Schiff's base between PBG synthase and one ALA molecule. Because both substrate molecules are chemically identical, there had been no evidence of enzyme-catalyzed partial reactions of ALA under conditions where PBG is not formed. In this study, NaBH4 was used to trap the Schiff's base formed between substrate ALA and active holo-PBG synthase, inactive apo-PBG synthase, and inactive methylmethanethiosulfonate-modified apo-PBG synthase. ALA-dependent NaBH4 inactivation of these enzyme forms was quantified at 50-62, 94-97, and 93-96% inactivation, respectively. [4-14C]ALA was used to determine the stoichiometry of Schiff's base trapping which was 2.3, 3.5-4.0, and 3.4 per octamer for holoenzyme, apoenzyme, and methylmethanethiosulfonate-modified apoenzyme, respectively. These results are consistent with four active sites per octamer or half-of-the-sites reactivity. We conclude that the production of the Schiff's base formed between one ALA molecule and the enzyme requires neither Zn(II) nor reduced enzyme sulfhydryl groups. Furthermore, the possible number of kinetic schemes for formation of the quaternary complex of enzyme, Zn(II), and two ALA moieties, one as the Schiff's base, has been reduced from 12 to 3. This is the first demonstration of a partial reaction catalyzed by PBG synthase with the natural substrate ALA under conditions which do not support PBG formation. Thus, we have opened the way toward investigating the partial reactions which may precede Zn(II) participation in the PBG synthase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1590965772,"Based on sequence data, rat and mouse pro-adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)/endorphin could give rise to joining peptide, a short acidic peptide that could terminate with a glutamic acid alpha-amide. Rat and mouse pituitary cells were found to cleave the pro-ACTH/endorphin precursor at an -Arg-Arg- site to produce primarily joining peptide-sized material. The amounts of joining peptide were approximately equimolar to the other major pro-ACTH/endorphin-derived products. Using antisera specific for the COOH-terminal modifications of joining peptide and three analytical approaches which separate amidated from glycine-extended forms of joining peptide, it was found that most of the joining peptide in murine anterior and intermediate pituitary was amidated. Identification of the amidated and glycine-extended forms of joining peptide was confirmed by amino acid analysis of the purified molecules. When anterior pituitary corticotrope tumor cells were grown in culture medium lacking ascorbate, there was no detectable ascorbate in the cells; nevertheless, a significant fraction of the joining peptide produced was alpha-amidated, indicating that production of alpha-amidated product was not totally dependent on ascorbate. The amidation state of the joining peptide produced by mouse corticotrope tumor cells was responsive to added ascorbate. Cells grown in medium containing ascorbic acid at the levels found in plasma concentrated the ascorbate to the levels normally found in pituitary tissue, and nearly all of the joining peptide produced was alpha-amidated. The amidation state of secreted joining peptide mirrored the amidation state of the joining peptide in the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1535549831,"Oxygen equilibrium curves of the extracellular hemoglobin from Lumbricus terrestris were determined under a variety of conditions. These data were characterized by (i) a rather small free energy of cooperativity (1.6-2.8 kcal/mol), (ii) a large and strongly pH-dependent Hill coefficient with a maximum value of 7.9, (iii) a high sensitivity of the upper asymptote of the Hill plot to pH, and (iv) a maximum association constant as large as that of the free beta subunit of human hemoglobin A. The effects of LiCl, KCl, NaCl, BaCl2, CaCl2, SrCl2, and MgCl2 on the oxygen equilibrium were measured. Cations, not Cl-, were found to control oxygen binding. Divalent cations have a larger effect on oxygen affinity than monovalent cations, and their effectiveness decreased in the order listed above within each valence class. These specific effects depend in part on ionic radius and cannot be explained in terms of ionic strength. The data indicate that the oxygenation-linked binding of a Ca2+ ion is accompanied by the release of two protons; the binding of a Na+ ion is associated with the release of one proton. These findings indicate that the oxygenation-linked cation-binding site contains two acid groups that do not readily dissociate their protons except when replaced by cations. Incubation at either pH 6.2 or 8.9 had no effect on subsequent measurements of oxygen equilibria at pH 7.8. The apparent heat of oxygenation was found to be -11.8, -7.3, and -9.3 kcal/mol at pH 9.0, 7.4, and 6.6, respectively. These differences indicate that proton-binding processes contribute to the heat of oxygenation."
https://openalex.org/W1523042336,"At 77 K, under excitation at 440 nm, two major fluorescence emission peaks were observed in envelope membranes from spinach chloroplasts at 636 and 680 nm. A narrow range of wavelengths around 440 nm and a wider range of wavelengths between 390 and 440 nm, respectively, were responsible for excitation of the 636 and 680 nm fluorescence emissions which, in marked contrast with thylakoid fluorescence emission, were devoid of any exciting components between 460 and 500 nm. In acetonic extract of envelope membranes, two fluorescence emission peaks were observed at 635 and 675 nm. After extraction of the acetonic solution by nonpolar solvents (petroleum ether or hexane), the 675 nm fluorescence emission was partitioned between the polar and nonpolar phases whereas the 635 nm fluorescence emission was solely recovered in the polar phase. All together, the results obtained suggest that envelope membranes contain low amounts of pigments having the absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic properties, together with the behavior in polar/nonpolar solvents, of protochlorophyllide and chlorophyllide. In addition, modulation of the level of fluorescence at 636 and 680 nm could be obtained by addition of NADPH to envelope membranes under illumination. The presence of protochlorophyllide in chloroplast envelope membranes together with its possible photoconversion into chlorophyllide could have major implication for the understanding of chlorophyll biosynthesis in mature chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W1495412240,"Abstract In an attempt to verify the recent proposal that the heme d1 prosthetic group isolated from cytochrome cd1 is not a chlorin, but a dioxo-isobacteriochlorin (Chang, C. K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9520-9522), a model dioxo-isobacteriochlorin has been synthesized possessing a pi-electron system exactly identical to that as proposed. The presence of an acrylic acid substituent strongly perturbs the absorption spectrum of the chromophore and produces a visible spectrum virtually indistinguishable from that of the iron-free heme d1. Based on this finding, buttressed by additional spectral correspondence between the model iron heme and heme d1, we conclude that the proposed diketo ring structure is indeed correct, and the trivial names dioneheme and acryloporphyrindione are suggested for heme d1 and the demetallated macrocycle, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1536473284,"Synthesis of procollagen was examined in skin fibroblasts from a patient with a moderately severe autosomal dominant form of osteogenesis imperfecta. Proteolytic removal of the propeptide regions of newly synthesized procollagen, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, revealed the presence of type I collagen in which two alpha 1(I) chains were linked through interchain disulfide bonds. Fragmentation of the disulfide-bonded alpha 1(I) dimers with vertebrate collagenase and cyanogen bromide demonstrated the presence of a cysteine residue in alpha 1(I)CB8, a fragment containing amino acid residues 124-402 of the alpha 1(I) collagen chain. Cysteine residues are not normally found in the triple-helical domain of type I collagen chains. The heterozygous nature of the molecular defect resulted in the formation of three kinds of type I trimers: a normal type with normal pro-alpha(I) chains, a type I trimer with one mutant pro-alpha 1(I) chain and two normal chains, and a type I trimer containing two mutant pro-alpha 1(I) chains and one normal pro-alpha 2(I) chain. The presence of one or two mutant pro-alpha 1(I) chains in trimers of type I procollagen was found to reduce the thermal stability of the protein by 2.5 and 1 degree C, respectively. In addition to post-translational overmodification, procollagen containing one mutant pro-alpha 1(I) chain was also cleared more slowly from cultured fibroblasts. The most likely explanation for these disruptive changes in the physical stability and secretion of the mutant procollagen is that a cysteine residue is substituted for a glycine in half of the pro-alpha 1(I) chains synthesized by the patient's fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1583081035,"Hydrogen exchange kinetic behavior of human erythrocyte glucose transporter protein in vesicles was studied in the absence and in the presence of D-glucose or a well known inhibitor, cytochalasin B. This is to detect a proposed channel of water penetrating into the protein through which the sugar molecule passes and to monitor any conformational changes induced by the substrate or inhibitor. Analyses of the kinetic data revealed several classes of hydrogens which exchange with readily distinguishable rates. Of 660 hydrogens detected per transporter, approximately 30% exchanged with rates generally characterized as those of free amide hydrogens indicating they are interfaced to solvent water. Since the transporter is known to be embedded deep in the hydrophobic area of the membrane with minimum exposure to the outside of the membrane lipid bilayer, a significant portion of these free amide hydrogens must be at the purported channel rather than outside of the membrane. D-Glucose and cytochalasin B affected the exchange kinetics of these presumably channel-associated free amide hydrogens rather differently. D-Glucose reduced the apparent rate constants, but not the total number. Cytochalasin B on the other hand reduced the total number to one-half without significantly changing the apparent rate constants. The remaining 70% of the labeled hydrogens exchanged with much slower rates which vary 10-10,000-fold, indicating that they are internally structured peptide amide and side chain hydrogens. Both D-glucose and cytochalasin B further reduced the rates of these hydrogens, indicating a global stabilization of the protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W1597982254,"Fragments D1 and DD, plasmic degradation products of human fibrinogen and cross-linked fibrin, respectively, originate from the COOH-terminal domain of the parent molecule. Since a specific binding site for fibrin resides in the COOH-terminal region of the gamma chain, the primary structure of the two fragments was compared and their affinity for fibrin monomer measured. Fragments D1 and DD contained the same segments of the three fibrinogen chains, corresponding to the sequences alpha 105-206, beta 134-461, and gamma 63-411. Fragment DD had a double set of the same chain remnants. Fragments D1 and DD inhibited polymerization of fibrin monomer in a dose-dependent manner; 50% inhibition occurred at a molar ratio of fragment to monomer of 1:1 and 0.5:1, respectively. To prevent fibrin monomer polymerization and render it suitable for binding studies in the liquid phase, fibrinogen was decorated with Fab fragments isolated from rabbit antibodies to human fragment D1. Fibrinogen molecules decorated with 6 molecules of this Fab fragment did not clot after incubation with thrombin, and the decorated fibrin monomer could be used to measure binding of fragments D1 and DD in a homogeneous liquid phase. The data analyzed according to the Scatchard equation and a double-reciprocal plot gave a dissociation constant of 12 nM for fragment D1 and 38 nM for fragment DD. There were two binding sites/fibrin monomer molecule for each fragment. After denaturation in 5 M guanidine HCl, the inhibitory function on fibrin polymerization was irreversibly destroyed. Denatured fragments also lost binding affinity for immobilized fibrin monomer. The preservation of the native tertiary structure in both fragments was essential for the expression of polymerization sites in the structural D domain."
https://openalex.org/W1541548884,"Resonance Raman investigations on compound II of native, diacetyldeuteroheme-, and manganese-substituted horseradish peroxidase (isozyme C) revealed that the metal-oxygen linkage in the compound differed from one another in its bond strength and/or structure. Fe(IV) = O stretching frequency for compound II of native enzyme was pH sensitive, giving the Raman line at 772 and 789 cm-1 at pH 7 and 10, respectively. The results confirmed the presence of a hydrogen bond between the oxo-ligand and a nearby amino acid residue (Sitter, A. J., Reczek, C. M., and Terner, J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7515-7522). The Fe(IV) = O stretch for compound II of diacetylheme-enzyme was located at 781 cm-1 at pH 7 which was 9 cm-1 higher than that of native enzyme compound II. At pH 10, however, the Fe(IV) = O stretch was found at 790 cm-1, essentially the same frequency as that of native enzyme compound II. The pK value for the pH transition, 8.5, was also the same as that of native compound II. Unlike in native enzyme, D2O-H2O exchange did not cause a shift of the Fe(IV) = O frequency of diacetylheme-enzyme. Thus, the metal-oxygen bond at pH 7 was stronger in diacetylheme-enzyme due to a weaker hydrogen bonding to the oxo-ligand, while the Fe(IV) = O bond strength became essentially the same between both enzymes at alkaline pH upon disruption of the hydrogen bond. A much lower reactivity of the diacetylheme-enzyme compound II was accounted to be due to the weaker hydrogen bond. Compound II of manganese-substituted enzyme exhibited Mn(IV)-oxygen stretch about 630 cm-1, which was pH insensitive but down-shifted by 18 cm-1 upon the D2O-H2O exchange. The finding indicates that its structure is in Mn(IV)-OH, where the proton is exchangeable with a water proton. These results establish that the structure of native enzyme compound II is Fe(IV) = O but not Fe(IV)-OH."

https://openalex.org/W2122179264,"Human low density lipoprotein (LDL), radiolabeled in the cholesteryl ester moiety, was injected into estrogen-treated and -untreated rats. The hepatic and extrahepatic distribution and biliary secretion of [3H]cholesteryl esters were determined at various times after injection. In order to follow the intrahepatic metabolism of the cholesteryl esters of LDL in vivo, the liver was subfractioned into parenchymal and Kupffer cells by a low temperature cell isolation procedure. In control rats, the LDL cholesteryl esters were mainly taken up by the Kupffer cells. After uptake, the [3H]cholesteryl esters are rapidly hydrolyzed, followed by release of [3H]cholesterol from the cells to other sites in the body. Up to 24 h after injection of LDL, only 9% of the radioactivity appeared in the bile, whereas after 72 h, this value was 30%. Hepatic and especially the parenchymal cell uptake of [3H]cholesteryl esters from LDL was strongly increased upon 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol treatment (3 days, 5 mg/kg). After rapid hydrolysis of the esters, [3H]cholesterol was both secreted into bile (28% of the injected dose in the first 24 h) as well as stored inside the cells as re-esterified cholesterol ester. It is concluded that uptake of human LDL by the liver in untreated rats is not efficiently coupled to biliary secretion of cholesterol (derivatives), which might be due to the anatomical localization of the principal uptake site, the Kupffer cells. In contrast, uptake of LDL cholesterol ester by liver hepatocytes is tightly coupled to bile excretion. The Kupffer cell uptake of LDL might be necessary in order to convert LDL cholesterol (esters) into a less toxic form. This activity can be functional in animals with low receptor activity on hepatocytes, as observed in untreated rats, or after diet-induced down-regulation of hepatocyte LDL receptors in other animals."
https://openalex.org/W1513574545,"13C NMR spectroscopy has been used to demonstrate that 13CN-labeled benzoylamidoacetonitrile forms a covalent adduct with the thiol group of cysteine 25 in the active site of papain. Spectral comparison with model compounds indicates that the adduct is a thioimidate. On the basis of a proposed mechanism for the formation of the thioimidate, it is concluded that the -CH2C(= NH)S--imino nitrogen does not sit in the active site in the same manner as the thiol ester carbonyl oxygen of the thiol acyl enzyme (or the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate). Thus, in this sense the stabilization of the thioimidate does not reflect a similarity in structure between the bound thioimidate and the transition state."
https://openalex.org/W1550815160,"Analysis of myoglobin levels in L6 cells (derived from rat skeletal muscle) by radioimmunoassay shows that myoglobin is not synthesized until after the cells differentiate to form multinucleated myotubes. Thereafter, myoglobin accumulates in a linear fashion for up to 20 days, the longest time for which the cultures may be reliably maintained. Treatment of cultures with hemin increased myoglobin levels in a dose-dependent manner resulting in a 70% increase in myoglobin with 20 microM hemin. Succinyl acetone, a heme synthesis inhibitor, reduced myoglobin levels by 40% while simultaneous treatment with hemin restored myoglobin levels to control values. Treatment of cultures with a variety of Fe(III) chelates known to enhance both iron accumulation and ferritin synthesis in L6 cells had no effect on myoglobin levels. delta-Aminolevulinic acid also had no effect on myoglobin levels. None of the treatments had any effect on either the total soluble protein or DNA content of the cultures, and, therefore, the observed effects appear to be specific for myoglobin. These results suggest that myoglobin is expressed as a function of differentiation and that intracellular heme exerts a regulatory effect on myoglobin levels."
https://openalex.org/W165807402,"The overall generation and inhibition of human factor Xa have been studied in pure systems and plasma to determine the kinetic characteristics of inhibition during factor Xa generation. Generation curves were measured amidolytically in a pure system containing factor X and antithrombin, which was activated with the factor X-activating enzyme of Russell's viper venom (RVV-X). The measured change in factor Xa level with time was fitted to a 3-parameter 2-exponential model to determine apparent first-order rates of inhibition. With antithrombin at 4.5 microM, the inhibition rate constant thus obtained was very close to the known rate of inhibition of exogenous enzyme. Factor Xa generation curves were also analyzed in plasma; however, to reduce interference in the assay of thrombin, congenitally prothrombin-deficient plasma was used containing 0.5 microM D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone. In plasma, factor Xa generated in the presence of phospholipid and Ca2+ ions by RVV-X, factor IXa, or tissue factor was inhibited more slowly than exogenous enzyme. The reduction was particularly severe with tissue factor activation, where the rate was 0.04-0.06 min-1. This protection by tissue factor was also observed in pure systems and apparently required factor VII."

Furthermore, the condensation of palmitoleoyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA was also noncompetitively inhibited by gamma-linolenoyl-CoA. Replacement of normal diet by a fat-free high carbohydrate diet resulted in 8-, 2.5-, and 2.3-fold increases in the condensation rates of both palmitoyl- and myristoyl-CoA, palmitoleoyl-CoA, and gamma-linolenoyl-CoA, respectively. On the other hand, administration of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) resulted in a 2-fold stimulation of the condensation activities with myristoyl- and palmitoyl-CoA, while those with palmitoleoyl- and gamma-linolenoyl-CoA decreased to about 83 and 63%, respectively. Similar results following dietary changes or DEHP administration were obtained for total elongation activities. Finally condensation activities of 16:0, 16:1, and gamma-18:3 CoA were differently affected by the proteolytic enzyme, chymotrypsin. The competitive substrate studies, those of dietary and DEHP administration, and the differential action of chymotrypsin strongly suggest the existence of at least three discrete condensing enzymes catalyzing the condensation of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated acyl-CoAs. These studies also indicate that the condensation reaction is the regulating and rate-limiting step of the fatty acid chain elongation system."
https://openalex.org/W1545196380,"The properties of sulfhemoglobin (sulfHb) were investigated using disc gel isoelectric focusing and optical spectrophotometry. Laboratory-prepared samples, which contained a high yield of sulfHb (70-85%), and a patient-derived sample, which contained a low yield (12%), contain a tetrameric population that reflects a random distribution of modified (sulfurated) subunits. Hybrid tetramers, i.e. those containing sulfurated and unmodified subunits, were resolved from fully sulfurated and unmodified hemoglobin upon electrofocusing of ferric or ferrous sulHb samples. The electrophoretic differences between ferric sulfHb and metHb arise from a difference in the pK for the met to hydroxymet conversion of sulfurated subunits (Carrico, R., Peisach, J., and Alben, J. O. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 2386-2391). Both partially and fully sulfurated tetramers, when in the deoxy form and when in the fully ligated CO form, co-focus with their unmodified deoxy-Hb and Hb CO counterparts. Thus, these sulfurated tetramers exhibit normal ligand-dependent ionization of Bohr protons. In air-equilibrated samples, hybrid tetramers are partially ligated as a result of the reduced O2 affinity of the sulfurated subunits. These partially ligated tetramers exhibit a pI intermediate between oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb due to the fractional ionization of Bohr protons. The partially sulfurated, partially ligated tetramers as well as deoxy-sulfHb tetramers were found to bind 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in disc gels. Despite the preservation of these heterotropic effects, which are confirmed in CO binding studies in solution, fully sulfurated tetramers recovered using preparative isoelectric focusing exhibit little or no cooperativity."

(1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 1761-1765). DNA replication in tsFT20 cells at the restrictive temperature (39 degrees C) has been characterized in detail. DNA-synthesizing ability of these cells was measured by [3H] thymidine incorporation and autoradiography. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine decreased rapidly after temperature shift-up, and the incorporation was less than 20% of the initial level after 4 h at 39 degrees C. The rapid decrease correlated well with the decrease in the grain number in the individual nucleus but not with the number of cells with labeled nuclei. Alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis and DNA fiber autoradiography revealed that DNA chain elongation proceeded normally within a replicon in the temperature-sensitive cells incubated at the restrictive temperature and the DNA elongation rate did not change during the incubation at the restrictive temperature up to at least 6 h. On the other hand, the maturation of replicon-sized DNA to higher molecular weight DNA was retarded or inhibited in the temperature-sensitive cells at the restrictive temperature. The analysis of the center to center distance between replicons by DNA fiber autoradiography revealed that the frequency of replicon initiation decreased in tsFT20 cells at 39 degrees C."

Chem. 258, 4511-4517) for trapping the intermediate compounds between human hemoglobin and carbon monoxide was validated by quantitatively determining during the approach to equilibrium all the species present in a solution containing large amounts of intermediates. An accurate estimate of the intermediate compounds at 50% carbon monoxide saturation in 0.1 M KCl, pH 7, at 22 degrees C, allowed the calculation, according to Adair's scheme, of the four equilibrium constants. At 50% ligand saturation, the pool of intermediate species was about 12% of the total. A slightly greater concentration of tri-liganded than mono-liganded species was found. Carbon monoxide bound to beta chains in slightly greater excess with respect to alpha chains in both the mono- and tri-liganded species. The symmetrical bi-liganded intermediates, alpha 2 beta CO2 and alpha 2CO beta 2, were absent. The nature of the bi-liganded intermediate found to be present in detectable amounts by our technique has yet to be clarified: it could be either the asymmetrical species (alpha beta) (alpha CO beta CO) and (alpha beta CO) (alpha CO beta) or both of them. Such a finding on the functional heterogeneity among the four possible bi-liganded intermediates is consistent with hypotheses of the existence of more than two quaternary structures in the course of ligand binding to hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1543618568,"The lability of RNA polymerase I has been examined by incubation at 37 degrees C. Under the conditions used virtually all enzyme activity was lost after 90 min incubation at this temperature. Concomitant with the decrease in enzyme activity was the disappearance of the 190-kDa enzyme subunit and the production of three small polypeptides of Mr 14,000-19,000. Using immunological methods the small polypeptides were shown to be cleavage products of the 190-kDa subunit. The 190-kDa-derived polypeptides retained all the antibody-binding sites of the large subunit that are important in RNA synthesis. The isolated cleavage products were able to bind to DNA as well as to active enzyme and to inhibit reversibly RNA synthesis. In addition to their binding properties, the 190-kDa-derived polypeptides, but not the intact 190-kDa subunit, were able to degrade DNA. These data suggest that multiple mechanisms exist in the control of RNA polymerase I-catalyzed transcription, namely, irreversible loss of the catalytic subunit coupled with reversible inhibition by the cleavage products as a result of competition for normal enzyme-DNA interactions and, possibly, involving activation of a cryptic nuclease."

Proc. 41, 507), was detected in aqueous extracts of porcine ovaries on the basis of a markedly enhanced action on prolyl bonds. This porcine form of DPP II, which was most sensitively assayed on Phe-Pro-2-naphthylamide (Phe-Pro-NNap), was purified 1400-fold to a specific activity of 28 mumol/min/mg of protein (pH 6.0, 37 degrees C) from an aqueous extract of hog ovaries taken during pregnancy, when ovarian levels of DPP II are some 3- to 8-fold higher. Purification involved ammonium sulfate fractionation, molecular exclusion chromatography, chromatofocusing, affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B, and high performance ion exchange chromatography. The purified enzyme, which was apparently electrophoretically homogeneous at pH 3, 7, and 8.8 (pI = 5.0), was shown to be an Mr = 110,000 glycoprotein containing about 2% carbohydrate (primarily mannose) and less than 1% sialic acid, and to consist of two noncovalently linked Mr = 54,000 subunits. A serine catalytic mechanism was supported by inhibitor studies and by common mobilities seen during electrophoresis for (histochemically detected) Phe-Pro-arylamidase activity and the [14C]diisopropyl fluorophosphate-labeled enzyme. In the standard fluorometric assay at 37 degrees C, Phe-Pro-NNap (0.2 mM) was hydrolyzed optimally at pH 6.0 (Km = 45 microM; kcat = 54 s-1). In comparison to the rate seen on Lys-Ala-NNap, the usual DI P II assay substrate, rates seen on Phe-Pro-, Lys-Pro-, and Arg-Pro-NNap were about 8-, 4-, and 2-fold higher, respectively. No action occurred on N-blocked derivatives or on Pro-NNap. Action on oligopeptides appeared to be limited to tripeptides, in particular those containing proline or alanine in the P1 position, i.e. Phe-Pro-Ala (100%), Lys-Ala-Ala (35%), Ala-Ala-Ala (33%), and Gly-Pro-Ala (26%). Only a trace of activity was seen on Phe-Pro-Ala-Ala, and none on Z-Phe-Pro-Ala or Ala-Ala-Ala-OMe. Evidence for the lysosomal localization of DPP II included sedimentability and latency and its distribution, coincident with acid phosphatase, in two distinct isopycnic regions following equilibrium density centrifugation. Lysosomal heterogeneity was suggested by this dual isopycnic banding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W59788232,"Incubation of human plasma fibronectin in the presence of low concentrations of FeCl3 or CuSO4 led to the formation of disulfide-bonded multimers as revealed by analysis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing or reducing conditions. The polymers induced by FeCl3 did not enter the spacer gel, and those induced by CuSO4 migrated to the top of the running gel, indicating that the former polymers were larger than the latter, which in gel filtration experiments appeared to be larger than Mr 670,000. The polymerization occurred between pH 7 and 9 and more rapidly at 22 or 37 degrees C than at 4 degrees C and was inhibited by metal-chelating reagents. NaCl, heparin, spermine, urea, or guanidine hydrochloride did not appreciably affect the reaction, whereas dithioerythritol enhanced the CuSO4-induced polymerization of fibronectin. When incubated in the presence of FeCl3, the Mr 30,000 NH2-terminal, Mr 40,000 gelatin-binding, and the Mr 120,000-140,000 COOH-terminal fragments of fibronectin formed disulfide-bonded polymers, whereas only the Mr 140,000 fragment was polymerized in the presence of CuSO4. Disulfide-bonded polymers were also formed in the presence of FeCl3 but not CuSO4 when the free sulfhydryl groups of fibronectin were blocked by N-ethylmaleimide. The results suggest that in the presence of CuSO4, disulfide-bonded polymerization of fibronectin may involve predominantly the free sulfhydryl groups, whereas in the presence of FeCl3, also the intramolecular disulfides may exchange to form disulfides between separate fibronectin molecules. Thus, under different conditions, different parts of fibronectin may be susceptible to disulfide-bonded polymerization."

Our most highly purified fractions had a specific activity in the presence of 6-methyltetrahydropterin, of 1.5 mumol of tyrosine formed/min/mg of protein, which is higher than has been reported hitherto. For the rat kidney enzyme, the ratio of specific activity in the presence of 6-methyltetrahydropterin to the specific activity in the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is 5. By contrast, this ratio for the unactivated rat liver hydroxylase is 80. These results indicate that the kidney enzyme is in a highly activated state. The rat kidney hydroxylase could not be further activated by any of the methods that stimulate the BH4-dependent activity of the rat liver enzyme. In addition, the kidney enzyme binds to phenyl-Sepharose without prior activation with phenylalanine. The phenylalanine saturation pattern with BH4 as a cofactor is hyperbolic with substrate inhibition at greater than 0.5 mM phenylalanine, a pattern that is characteristic of the activated liver hydroxylase. The molecular weight of the rat kidney enzyme as determined by gel permeation chromatography is 110,000, suggesting that the enzyme might be an activated dimer. We conclude, therefore, that phenylalanine hydroxylases from rat kidney and liver are in different states of activation and may be regulated in different ways."

Here we demonstrate that the difference in Mr results from excision of a peptide from the COOH terminus of the alpha-chain of C4s. The site of truncation of the alpha-chain of C4 in plasma was established by sequence analysis of the COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide fragment isolated by high performance liquid chromatography. Sequential Edman degradation, digestion with carboxypeptidase Y, analysis of amino acid composition, and partial sequence analysis of an overlapping tryptic peptide established the sequence of this peptide to be Glu-Ala-Asn-Glu-Asp-Tyr-Glu-Asp-Tyr-Glu-Tyr-Asp-Glu-Leu-Pro-Ala. Comparison of our results with reported sequences establishes the COOH-terminal alanine to be residue 748 in the alpha-chain. This identifies the site at which C4s is cleaved by an extracellular protease and suggests that the protease has an elastase-like activity."
https://openalex.org/W1559515342,"Rearrangements of chromatin structure during excision repair of UV-damaged DNA appear to involve unfolding of nucleosomal DNA while repair is taking place, followed by refolding of this DNA into a native nucleosome structure. Recently, we found that repair patches are not distributed uniformly along the DNA in nucleosome core particles immediately following their refolding into nucleosomes (Lan, S. Y., and Smerdon, M. J. (1985) Biochemistry, 24,7771). Therefore, the distribution of repair patches in nucleosome core DNA was used to monitor the stability of nucleosome placement in these regions. Our results indicate that in nondividing human cells undergoing excision repair there is a slow change in the positioning of nucleosomes in newly repaired regions of chromatin, resulting in the eventual randomization of repair patches in nucleosome core DNA. Furthermore, the nonrandom placement of nucleosomes observed just after the refolding event is not re-established during DNA replication. Possible mechanisms for this change in nucleosome placement along the DNA are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1494519238,"Horseradish peroxidase will catalyze the chlorination of certain substrates by sodium chlorite through an intermediate known as compound X. A chlorite-derived chlorine atom is known to be retained by compound X and has been proposed to be located at the heme active site. Although several heme structures have been proposed for compound X, including an Fe(IV)-OCl group, preliminary data previously reported by our laboratory suggested that compound X contained a heme Fe(IV) = O group, based on the similarity of a compound X resonance Raman band at 788 cm-1 to resonance Raman Fe(IV) = O stretching vibrations recently identified for horseradish peroxidase compound II and ferryl myoglobin. Isotopic studies now confirm that the 788 cm-1 resonance Raman band of compound X is, in fact, due to a heme Fe(IV) = O group, with the oxygen atom derived from chlorite. The Fe(IV) = O frequency of compound X, of horseradish peroxidase isoenzymes B and C, undergoes a pH-induced frequency shift, with behavior which appears to be the same as that previously reported for compound II, formed from the same isoenzymes. These observations strongly suggest that compounds II and X have very similar, if not identical, heme structures. The chlorine atom thus appears not to be heme-bound and may rather be located on an amino acid residue. The studies on compound X reported here were done in a pH region above pH 8, where compound X is moderately stable. The present results do not necessarily apply to compound X below pH 8."
https://openalex.org/W1505732977,"During induction of the heat shock response by temperature jump in the protozoan Tetrahymena, a decrease in cellular ATP levels occurs within minutes and cells become thermotolerant. Treatment of Tetrahymena with the amino acid analog canavanine also induces synthesis of heat shock proteins, but more slowly than by temperature jump. No changes in cellular ATP levels were observed during the course of canavanine induction of heat shock protein synthesis measured in vivo by the technique of 31P NMR spectroscopy. Tetrahymena do not become thermotolerant following induction of heat shock protein synthesis with canavanine. However, Tetrahymena will develop thermotolerance in the presence of canavanine if they are first subjected to a nonlethal temperature jump before exposure to a normally lethal temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2416717097,"The resonance Raman spectra of the two affinity states of the CO-ligated monomeric insect hemoglobins, Chironomus thummi thummi (CTT) III ad IV, have been investigated. We have identified (via 54Fe/57Fe and 13C18O/12C16O isotope exchange) the Fe-N epsilon(His) stretching mode at approximately 317 cm-1. This stretching mode changes from 329 (pH 5.5) to 317 cm-1 (pH 9.5) reflecting the pH-induced t in equilibrium with r conformational transition. The Fe-CO stretching mode is also pH-sensitive changing from 483 (pH 5.2) to 485 cm-1 (pH 9.2) in 57Fe CTT III . 13C18O complex. However the C-O stretching mode is pH-insensitive. The nonallosteric monomeric insect hemoglobin CTT I does not exhibit a pH-dependence of these vibrational modes. pH-Induced effects were also observed for a vinyl bending mode at 379 cm-1 (pH 9.5) in CTT III deuterated at the beta-carbons of the vinyls in position 2 and 4. It shifts to 390 cm-1 at pH 5.5. The other vinyl vibration at 573 cm-1 exhibits intensity enhancement via through-space coupling with the Fe-C-O bending mode. Our resonance Raman data provide the first direct evidence that the trans-effect is operative as a trigger mechanism for ligand-binding in monomeric allosteric insect hemoglobins. In going from the low-affinity to the high-affinity state, the Fe-N epsilon(His) bond becomes weaker, whereas the Fe-CO bond becomes stronger."
https://openalex.org/W1536304050,"In this communication we report the synthesis and characterization of a defined-sequence, alternating purine-pyrimidine polymer with a 10-base pair repeating unit: poly[d(CGCGCGTGCA)]. It is seen that the polymer can undergo a right-left-hand helical transition, but the conformational transition requires much higher salt concentration than with poly[d(G-C)]. The results are interpreted in terms of interaction of the polymer with solvent molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1564005374,"The chemical nature of the inactivation of citrate synthase by S-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)-CoA, an active site-directed irreversible inhibitor, has been investigated. Active site-directed inactivation leads to derivatization of either Lys22 by epsilon-amino Schiff base formation or Glu363 by apparent alkylation of the gamma-carboxyl group, respectively. Lys22 is labeled in the tight (catalytic) form of the enzyme while Glu363 is labeled in the open (product release) form. Glu363 and Lys22 are both located at or near the entrance to an active site in the crystal structure of citrate synthase (Remington, S., Wiegand, G., and Huber, R. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 158, 111-152). Glu363 is in the sequence of the protomer forming the active site while Lys22 is in the sequence of the other polypeptide in the homodimer. Labeling in this region appears to inactivate the enzyme by preventing access of substrates to the active site. A distinct and separate labeling process involves derivatization of Asn192 in the tight (catalytic) form and Ser198 and/or Ser199 in the open (product release) form at a locus far removed from the active site. Labeling at the second site may simply identify chemically reactive residues, or it may identify the binding site for long chain acyl-CoA, which has been identified as a possible allosteric negative effector of citrate synthase (Caggiano, A. V., and Powell, G. L. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 2800-2806). This second labeling process apparently inactivates the enzyme by interfering with catalytically essential conformational changes."
