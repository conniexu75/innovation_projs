https://openalex.org/W2990471452,"Genome mining has become a key technology to exploit natural product diversity. Although initially performed on a single-genome basis, the process is now being scaled up to mine entire genera, strain collections and microbiomes. However, no bioinformatic framework is currently available for effectively analyzing datasets of this size and complexity. In the present study, a streamlined computational workflow is provided, consisting of two new software tools: the ‘biosynthetic gene similarity clustering and prospecting engine’ (BiG-SCAPE), which facilitates fast and interactive sequence similarity network analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters and gene cluster families; and the ‘core analysis of syntenic orthologues to prioritize natural product gene clusters’ (CORASON), which elucidates phylogenetic relationships within and across these families. BiG-SCAPE is validated by correlating its output to metabolomic data across 363 actinobacterial strains and the discovery potential of CORASON is demonstrated by comprehensively mapping biosynthetic diversity across a range of detoxin/rimosamide-related gene cluster families, culminating in the characterization of seven detoxin analogues. Two bioinformatic tools, BiG-SCAPE and CORASON, enable sequence similarity network and phylogenetic analysis of gene clusters and their families across hundreds of strains and in large datasets, leading to the discovery of new natural products."
https://openalex.org/W2990556745,"Tendon injuries cause prolonged disability and never recover completely. Current mechanistic understanding of tendon regeneration is limited. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics to identify a tubulin polymerization-promoting protein family member 3-expressing (Tppp3+) cell population as potential tendon stem cells. Through inducible lineage tracing, we demonstrate that these cells can generate new tenocytes and self-renew upon injury. A fraction of Tppp3+ cells expresses platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdfgra). Ectopic platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA) protein induces new tenocyte production while inactivation of Pdgfra in Tppp3+ cells blocks tendon regeneration. These results support Tppp3+Pdgfra+ cells as tendon stem cells. Unexpectedly, Tppp3-Pdgfra+ fibro-adipogenic progenitors coexist in the tendon stem cell niche and give rise to fibrotic cells, revealing a clandestine origin of fibrotic scars in healing tendons. Our results explain why fibrosis occurs in injured tendons and present clinical challenges to enhance tendon regeneration without a concurrent increase in fibrosis by PDGF application."

This motivated a combined analysis across ASD and ADHD, identifying microtubule-associated protein 1A (MAP1A) as a new exome-wide significant gene conferring risk for childhood psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2991289264,"Internal states shape stimulus responses and decision-making, but we lack methods to identify them. To address this gap, we developed an unsupervised method to identify internal states from behavioral data and applied it to a dynamic social interaction. During courtship, Drosophila melanogaster males pattern their songs using feedback cues from their partner. Our model uncovers three latent states underlying this behavior and is able to predict moment-to-moment variation in song-patterning decisions. These states correspond to different sensorimotor strategies, each of which is characterized by different mappings from feedback cues to song modes. We show that a pair of neurons previously thought to be command neurons for song production are sufficient to drive switching between states. Our results reveal how animals compose behavior from previously unidentified internal states, which is a necessary step for quantitative descriptions of animal behavior that link environmental cues, internal needs, neuronal activity and motor outputs."
https://openalex.org/W2989719215,"Covalent probes serve as valuable tools for global investigation of protein function and ligand binding capacity. Despite efforts to expand coverage of residues available for chemical proteomics (e.g., cysteine and lysine), a large fraction of the proteome remains inaccessible with current activity-based probes. Here, we introduce sulfur-triazole exchange (SuTEx) chemistry as a tunable platform for developing covalent probes with broad applications for chemical proteomics. We show modifications to the triazole leaving group can furnish sulfonyl probes with ~5-fold enhanced chemoselectivity for tyrosines over other nucleophilic amino acids to investigate more than 10,000 tyrosine sites in lysates and live cells. We discover that tyrosines with enhanced nucleophilicity are enriched in enzymatic, protein-protein interaction and nucleotide recognition domains. We apply SuTEx as a chemical phosphoproteomics strategy to monitor activation of phosphotyrosine sites. Collectively, we describe SuTEx as a biocompatible chemistry for chemical biology investigations of the human proteome."

https://openalex.org/W2991468917,"To discover novel genes underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we aggregated exomes from 3,864 cases and 7,839 ancestry-matched controls. We observed a significant excess of rare protein-truncating variants among ALS cases, and these variants were concentrated in constrained genes. Through gene level analyses, we replicated known ALS genes including SOD1, NEK1 and FUS. We also observed multiple distinct protein-truncating variants in a highly constrained gene, DNAJC7. The signal in DNAJC7 exceeded genome-wide significance, and immunoblotting assays showed depletion of DNAJC7 protein in fibroblasts in a patient with ALS carrying the p.Arg156Ter variant. DNAJC7 encodes a member of the heat-shock protein family, HSP40, which, along with HSP70 proteins, facilitates protein homeostasis, including folding of newly synthesized polypeptides and clearance of degraded proteins. When these processes are not regulated, misfolding and accumulation of aberrant proteins can occur and lead to protein aggregation, which is a pathological hallmark of neurodegeneration. Our results highlight DNAJC7 as a novel gene for ALS. DNA sequencing of 3,864 individuals with ALS and 7,839 controls identified a novel disease gene, DNAJC7, which encodes a heat-shock protein. As DNAJC7 is an essential part of cell maintenance, mutations in DNAJC7 may lead to neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2990462567,"Multidrug resistant organisms are a serious threat to human health1,2. Fast, accurate antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) is a critical need in addressing escalating antibiotic resistance, since delays in identifying multidrug resistant organisms increase mortality3,4 and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, further selecting for resistant organisms. Yet current growth-based AST assays, such as broth microdilution5, require several days before informing key clinical decisions. Rapid AST would transform the care of patients with infection while ensuring that our antibiotic arsenal is deployed as efficiently as possible. Growth-based assays are fundamentally constrained in speed by doubling time of the pathogen, and genotypic assays are limited by the ever-growing diversity and complexity of bacterial antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Here we describe a rapid assay for combined genotypic and phenotypic AST through RNA detection, GoPhAST-R, that classifies strains with 94-99% accuracy by coupling machine learning analysis of early antibiotic-induced transcriptional changes with simultaneous detection of key genetic resistance determinants to increase accuracy of resistance detection, facilitate molecular epidemiology and enable early detection of emerging resistance mechanisms. This two-pronged approach provides phenotypic AST 24-36 h faster than standard workflows, with <4 h assay time on a pilot instrument for hybridization-based multiplexed RNA detection implemented directly from positive blood cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2990021145,"Redox balance, an essential feature of healthy physiological steady states, is regulated by circadian clocks, but whether or how endogenous redox signalling conversely regulates clockworks in mammals remains unknown. Here, we report circadian rhythms in the levels of endogenous H2O2 in mammalian cells and mouse livers. Using an unbiased method to screen for H2O2-sensitive transcription factors, we discovered that rhythmic redox control of CLOCK directly by endogenous H2O2 oscillations is required for proper intracellular clock function. Importantly, perturbations in the rhythm of H2O2 levels induced by the loss of p66Shc, which oscillates rhythmically in the liver and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of mice, disturb the rhythmic redox control of CLOCK function, reprogram hepatic transcriptome oscillations, lengthen the circadian period in mice and modulate light-induced clock resetting. Our findings suggest that redox signalling rhythms are intrinsically coupled to the circadian system through reversible oxidative modification of CLOCK and constitute essential mechanistic timekeeping components in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2990455352,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in regulating social functions in mammals, and its dysfunction has been linked to social deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet little is known of how the PFC encodes social information and how social representations may be altered in such disorders. Here, we show that neurons in the medial PFC of freely behaving male mice preferentially respond to socially relevant olfactory cues. Population activity patterns in this region differed between social and nonsocial stimuli and underwent experience-dependent refinement. In mice lacking the autism-associated gene Cntnap2, both the categorization of sensory stimuli and the refinement of social representations were impaired. Noise levels in spontaneous population activity were higher in Cntnap2 knockouts and correlated with the degree to which social representations were disrupted. Our findings elucidate the encoding of social sensory cues in the medial PFC and provide a link between altered prefrontal dynamics and autism-associated social dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2989621922,"Biological production of chemicals often requires the use of cellular cofactors, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). These cofactors are expensive to use in vitro and difficult to control in vivo. We demonstrate the development of a noncanonical redox cofactor system based on nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN+). The key enzyme in the system is a computationally designed glucose dehydrogenase with a 107-fold cofactor specificity switch toward NMN+ over NADP+ based on apparent enzymatic activity. We demonstrate that this system can be used to support diverse redox chemistries in vitro with high total turnover number (~39,000), to channel reducing power in Escherichia coli whole cells specifically from glucose to a pharmaceutical intermediate, levodione, and to sustain the high metabolic flux required for the central carbon metabolism to support growth. Overall, this work demonstrates efficient use of a noncanonical cofactor in biocatalysis and metabolic pathway design."

https://openalex.org/W2990914627,"Many members of the AAA+ ATPase family function as hexamers that unfold their protein substrates. These AAA unfoldases include spastin, which plays a critical role in the architecture of eukaryotic cells by driving the remodeling and severing of microtubules, which are cytoskeletal polymers of tubulin subunits. Here, we demonstrate that a human spastin binds weakly to unmodified peptides from the C-terminal segment of human tubulin α1A/B. A peptide comprising alternating glutamate and tyrosine residues binds more tightly, which is consistent with the known importance of glutamylation for spastin microtubule severing activity. A cryo-EM structure of the spastin-peptide complex at 4.2 A resolution revealed an asymmetric hexamer in which five spastin subunits adopt a helical, spiral staircase configuration that binds the peptide within the central pore, whereas the sixth subunit of the hexamer is displaced from the peptide/substrate, as if transitioning from one end of the helix to the other. This configuration differs from a recently published structure of spastin from Drosophila melanogaster, which forms a six-subunit spiral without a transitioning subunit. Our structure resembles other recently reported AAA unfoldases, including the meiotic clade relative Vps4, and supports a model in which spastin utilizes a hand-over-hand mechanism of tubulin translocation and microtubule remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2990111387,"Background Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone tumor affecting humans and it has extreme heterogeneity. Despite modern therapy, it recurs in approximately 30–40% of patients initially diagnosed with no metastatic disease, with the long-term survival rates of patients with recurrent OS being generally 20%. Thus, early prediction of metastases in OS management plans is crucial for better-adapted treatments and survival rates. In this study, a radiomics model for metastasis risk prediction in OS was developed and evaluated using metabolic imaging phenotypes. Methods and findings The subjects were eighty-three patients with OS, and all were treated with surgery and chemotherapy for local control. All patients underwent a pretreatment 18F-FDG-PET scan. Forty-five features were extracted from the tumor region. The incorporation of features into multivariable models was performed using logistic regression. The multivariable modeling strategy involved cross validation in the following four steps leading to final prediction model construction: (1) feature set reduction and selection; (2) model coefficients computation through train and validation processing; and (3) prediction performance estimation. The multivariable logistic regression model was developed using two radiomics features, SUVmax and GLZLM-SZLGE. The trained and validated multivariable logistic model based on probability of endpoint (P) = 1/ (1+exp (-Z)) was Z = -1.23 + 1.53*SUVmax + 1.68*GLZLM-SZLGE with significant p-values (SUVmax: 0.0462 and GLZLM_SZLGE: 0.0154). The final multivariable logistic model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve of 0.80, a sensitivity of 0.66, and a specificity of 0.88 in cross validation. Conclusions The SUVmax and GLZLM-SZLGE from metabolic imaging phenotypes are independent predictors of metastasis risk assessment. They show the association between 18F-FDG-PET and metastatic colonization knowledge. The multivariable model developed using them could improve patient outcomes by allowing aggressive treatment in patients with high metastasis risk."
https://openalex.org/W2991299974,"Background Lifestyle change can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes among women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). While understanding women’s lived experiences and views around GDM is critical to the development of behaviour change interventions to reduce this risk, few studies have addressed this issue in low- and middle- income countries. The aim of the study was to explore women’s lived experiences of GDM and the feasibility of sustained lifestyle modification after GDM in a low-income setting. Methods This was a descriptive qualitative study on the lived experiences of women with prior GDM, who received antenatal care at a public sector tertiary hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Nine focus groups and five in-depth interviews were conducted with a total of thirty-five women. Data were analysed using content analysis and the COM-B (Capabilities, Opportunities, Motivations and Behaviour) model to identify factors influencing lifestyle change during and beyond the GDM pregnancy. Results The results suggest that the COM-B model’s concepts of capability (knowledge and skills for behaviour change), opportunity (resources for dietary change and physical activity) and motivation (perception of future diabetes risk) are relevant to lifestyle change among GDM women in South Africa. The results will contribute to the design of a postpartum health system intervention for women with recent GDM. Conclusion Our findings highlight the need for health services to improve counselling and education for women with GDM in South Africa. Support from family and health professionals is essential for women to achieve lifestyle change. The experience of GDM imposed a significant psychological burden on women, which affected motivation for lifestyle change. To achieve long-term lifestyle change, behaviour interventions for women with prior GDM need to address their capability, opportunity and motivation for lifestyle change during and beyond pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2990768607,"Oxaliplatin is the first-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Unlike other platinum anticancer agents, oxaliplatin does not result in significant renal impairment and ototoxicity. Oxaliplatin, however, has been associated with acute and chronic peripheral neuropathies. Despite the awareness of these side-effects, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be clearly established. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to understand the factors involved in the generation of chronic neuropathy elicited by oxaliplatin treatment. We established a rat model of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain (4 mg kg-1 intraperitoneally). The paw withdrawal thresholds were assessed at different time-points after the treatment, and a significant decrease was observed 3 and 4 weeks after oxaliplatin treatment as compared to the vehicle treatment (4.4 ± 1.0 vs. 16.0 ± 4.1 g; P < 0.05 and 4.4 ± 0.7 vs. 14.8 ± 3.1 g; P < 0.05, respectively). We further evaluated the role of different mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. Although the levels of total extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were not different between oxaliplatin and vehicle treatment groups, phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) 1/2 was up-regulated up to 4.5-fold in the oxaliplatin group. Administration of ERK inhibitor PD98059 (6 μg day-1 intrathecally) inhibited oxaliplatin-induced ERK phosphorylation and neuropathic pain. Therefore, upregulation of p-ERK by oxaliplatin in rat DRG and inhibition of mechanical allodynia by an ERK inhibitor in the present study may provide a better understanding of intracellular molecular alterations associated with oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain and help in the development of potential therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2991245210,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that suppress the expression of multiple genes and are involved in numerous biologic functions and disorders, including human diseases. Here, we report that two miRNAs, miR-302b and miR-372, target mitochondrial-mediated antiviral innate immunity by regulating mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic demand. Using human cell lines transfected with the synthetic analog of viral dsRNA, poly(I-C), or challenged with Sendai virus, we found that both miRNAs are up-regulated in the cells late after viral infection and ultimately terminate the production of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines. We found that miR-302b and miR-372 are involved in dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation and disrupt mitochondrial metabolism by attenuating solute carrier family 25 member 12 (SLC25A12), a member of the SLC25 family. Neutralizing the effects of the two miRNAs through specific inhibitors re-established the mitochondrial dynamics and the antiviral responses. We found that SLC25A12 contributes to regulating the antiviral response by inducing mitochondrial-related metabolite changes in the organelle. Structure–function analysis indicated that SLC25A12, as part of a prohibitin complex, associates with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein in mitochondria, providing structural insight into the regulation of the mitochondrial-mediated antiviral response. Our results contribute to the understanding of how miRNAs modulate the innate immune response by altering mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic demand.

In mammals, innate immunity against viral infection requires the activation of multiple signaling steps that culminate in the rapid production of type I interferons (IFN-α and -β) and other proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES, also known as CCL5), that provide first-line host defense. The immune response is triggered by the recognition of broadly-conserved viral components, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (e.g. dsRNA or 5′-triphosphated single-stranded RNA), by host-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), and Toll-like receptor 3 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) act as the PRRs (7Kawai T.

We followed 53 miRNAs that were up-regulated more than 3-fold in poly(I-C)-transfected cells relative to those in the mock state (Table S1). To confirm that we would be observing a specific response to activation of the RLR-dependent signaling pathway, we induced another viral infection using Sendai virus (SeV), a negative-stranded RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family. Remarkably, nine miRNA candidates (miR-1250, miR-143, miR-302b, miR-338, miR-372, miR-410, miR-485, miR-520f, and miR-922) were well-matched between these two different stimuli (Fig. 1A and Table S1). We therefore evaluated whether these miRNAs with increased levels had a role in the RLR-signaling pathway. Although the delivery of poly(I-C) into HEK293 cells potently activated an IFN-β luciferase-based reporter (Fig. 1B, NC), co-transfection of each miRNA mimic with poly(I-C) had various effects on the activation of its reporter. Among the nine candidates mentioned above, we confirmed that the delivery of three miRNA mimics (miR-302b, miR-372, and miR-520f) with poly(I-C) was sufficient to inhibit signal transduction (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the delivery of two miRNA mimics, miR-302b and miR-372, in HeLa cells (widely used for mitochondrial imaging) led to extensively fragmented mitochondria (Fig. 1C and Table 1). These findings suggest that miR-302b and miR-372 affected the activity of both the RLR pathway and mitochondrial morphology. Because miR-302b and miR-372 have homologous seed sequences that can target overlapping genes (18Agarwal V. Bell G.W. Nam J.W. Bartel D.P. Predicting effective microRNA target sites in mammalian mRNAs.Elife. 2015; 4 (26267216): e0500510.7554/eLife.05005Crossref PubMed Scopus (4377) Google Scholar), we mainly analyzed the function of miR-302b and confirmed the results against miR-372 in the following experiments.Table 1Summary of miRNAs involved in the RLR pathway and mitochondrial dynamicsmiRNAmiRNA expression (fold per control)Luciferase activity, IFN-β(fold % per control)Mitochondrial morphologyPoly(I-C) stimulationSeV infectionhsa-miR-12502292.516.1Normal tubularhsa-miR-14313814.740.8Normal tubularhsa-miR-302b-3p4.32.93.5Strong fragmentationhsa-miR-338-5p3.15.036.7Normal tubularhsa-miR-3724.32.46.5Strong fragmentationhsa-miR-41070.1110186Normal tubularhsa-miR-485-3p28721245.6Normal tubularhsa-miR-520f-3p17.35.47.8Partial fragmentationhsa-miR-92216.313.071.5Normal tubular Open table in a new tab Having identified that miR-302b (also miR-372) might link antiviral cellular innate immunity with mitochondrial potentials, we evaluated the functional role of the miRNA involved in mitochondrial-mediated antiviral innate immunity. The kinetic profile of IFN-β expression in A549 cells (widely used in viral research) infected with SeV peaked at 6 h post-infection (p.i.) as detected by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the IFN-β mRNA level was sharply decreased at 12 h p.i. (Fig. 1D, top), which is a typical antiviral immune response (19Whittemore L.A. Maniatis T. Postinduction turnoff of β-interferon gene expression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10 (2157136): 1329-133710.1128/MCB.10.4.1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Expression of miR-302b, which was delayed relative to that of IFN-β, was induced 12 h after infection and increased for up to 36 h p.i.; this lagging trend in the expression was also observed in cells transfected with poly(I-C) (Fig. 1D, bottom; see also Fig. S1A). To verify that the observed RLR-mediated up-regulation of miR-302b was not due to a specific characteristic of the cell type we used, we performed the same miRNA induction experiments in other human cell lines, MRC-5 (fetal lung fibroblasts) and HAP-1 (widely used for biomedical and genetic research), and confirmed that both cell types also exhibited increased expression of miR-302b (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1B). Because altering the level of miR-302b in cells would be consistent with an antiviral immune response (Fig. 1, B and D), we hypothesized that the miRNA acts as a modulator of the RLR-signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we treated HEK293 cells with the miR-302b mimic and assessed their immune response against either viral infection or poly(I-C) stimulation. The viral-triggered induction of IFN-β and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as RANTES or TNFα was dramatically suppressed in cells transfected with the miR-302b mimic (Fig. 1F and Fig. S1, C and D). In addition, we confirmed that an abundant presence of the miR-302b mimic in the cells similarly attenuated the phosphorylation of endogenous interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3; Fig. 1G), a hallmark of IRF-3 activation, and the production of endogenous IFN-β protein (Fig. 1H and Fig. S1, E and F). Treatment of HEK293 cells with the miR-302b mimic similarly reduced the activation of both IFN-β and NF-κB reporters in response to overexpression of either the N-terminal CARD domain of RIG-I (designated as RIG-I1–250) or MAVS, the MOM protein that acts downstream of RIG-I (Fig. S1G) (9Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Identification and characterization of MAVS, a mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein that activates NF-κB and IRF3.Cell. 2005; 122 (16125763): 669-68210.1016/j.cell.2005.08.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). Most importantly, interfering with either endogenous miR-302b or miR-372 by applying its specific inhibitors to poly(I-C)-stimulated HEK293 (Fig. 2A) or HAP-1 (Fig. 2B) cells sufficiently increased the production of IFN-β. Taken together, these observations indicated that miR-302b (also miR-372) acts as a negative regulator of the mitochondrial-mediated antiviral response and suggests that it would act in the late stage of viral infection. Because the accumulation of miR-302b in HeLa cells leads to remarkable mitochondrial fragmentation that is restored by the presence of its specific inhibitors (Fig. 3, A and B, and Fig. S2, A and B), we next attempted to elucidate whether certain molecules involved in mitochondrial dynamics are associated with the phenomenon. To reveal its mechanistic actions, we performed microarray analysis in HEK293 cells transfected with the miR-302b mimic. Gene expression profiling of the cells revealed an association of miR-302b with the mitochondrial dynamics (Fig. 3C, left heat map), especially the mitochondrial fission process. The observed up-regulation of MID49, MID51, and MFF, adaptors for dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) (20Otera H. Ishihara N. Mihara K.

Indeed, the search for target genes against miR-302b using the program TargetScan revealed that RAB32 had a putative binding sequence in the 3′-UTR of the mRNA. To confirm the predicted results experimentally, we constructed a reporter plasmid in which the 3′-UTR region of RAB32(110–140) was cloned into a Renilla luciferase reporter gene. The results of the reporter assay confirmed that the luciferase activity in HEK293 cells transfected with the miR-302b mimic was greatly attenuated when the WT RAB32 plasmid was co-transfected, whereas co-transfection with its mismatch-induced mutant plasmid had no effect (Fig. 3D and Fig. S2C). Consistent with these results, delivery of the miR-302b mimic into the cells significantly affected the abundance of endogenous RAB32 at both the mRNA (Fig. S2, D and E) and protein (Fig. 3E) levels. In addition, we observed that eliminating RAB32 through the action of miR-302b suppressed the phosphorylation of DRP1 at Ser637 (Fig. 3F), a hallmark of DRP1 activation (24Chang C.R. Blackstone C. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation of Drp1 regulates its GTPase activity and mitochondrial morphology.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 (17553808): 21583-2158710.1074/jbc.C700083200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), as seen in HEK293 cells treated with siRNA against RAB32 (Fig. S2F). In contrast, HEK293 cells transfected with the miR-302b mimic also exhibited increased expression of the DRP1 adaptors MID49 and MID51, as confirmed by the increase in the amounts of their proteins in the cells (Fig. 3G). DRP1 recruitment in the mitochondrial fraction was sufficiently increased in an miR-302b-dependent manner (Fig. 3H), further indicating that our morphologic phenotype resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation (25Losón O.C. Song Z. Chen H. Chan D.C. Fis1, Mff, MiD49, and MiD51 mediate Drp1 recruitment in mitochondrial fission.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24 (23283981): 659-66710.1091/mbc.e12-10-0721Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Together, these results highlighted the mechanism by which miR-302b is involved in mitochondrial fission via the DRP1-dependent pathway. The presence of excess fragmented mitochondria ultimately leads to cellular signaling dysfunction, including the mitochondrial-mediated antiviral response (14Castanier C. Garcin D. Vazquez A. Arnoult D. Mitochondrial dynamics regulate the RIG-I-like receptor antiviral pathway.EMBO Rep. 2010; 11 (20019757): 133-13810.1038/embor.2009.258Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next evaluated whether arresting DRP1 activity in cells treated with an miR-302b mimic (Fig. S2G) would affect RLR-mediated signal transduction. As reported previously (14Castanier C. Garcin D. Vazquez A. Arnoult D. Mitochondrial dynamics regulate the RIG-I-like receptor antiviral pathway.EMBO Rep. 2010; 11 (20019757): 133-13810.1038/embor.2009.258Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), depleting endogenous DRP1 in HEK293 cells through its specific siRNA enhanced the induction of both IFN-β and RANTES in response to poly(I-C) stimulation relative to that in control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3I). However, the loss of DRP1 in cells treated with the miR-302b mimic also showed potential induction of immune responses compared with controls, but the recovery was only partial in the cells transfected with a negative control mimic (Fig. 3I, NC/siDRP1 versus miR-302b/siDRP1). These findings suggest that some other factors besides mitochondrial morphology are involved in the RLR pathway, leading us to explore the direct involvement in signal transduction. Thorough analysis of our microarray data revealed that SLC25A12, a member of the solute carrier family, was intensively down-regulated in miR-302b–transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). As expected, SLC25A12 possessed an miR-302b–binding sequence in its 3′-UTR (Fig. 4B and Fig. S3A), whose low abundance of protein was experimentally confirmed in cells transfected with the miRNA mimic (Fig. 4C). Strikingly, the antiviral immune responses detected on the basis of the expression of IFN-β and RANTES in HEK293 cells stimulated by poly(I-C) were significantly decreased in an SLC25A12-depleted condition (Fig. 4D). Knockdown of endogenous SLC25A12 in the cells similarly reduced IFN-β reporter activation in response to the overexpression of either RIG-I1–250 or MAVS constructs (Fig. S3B). We also verified the antiviral immune function of SLC25A12 using SLC25A12-deficient HAP-1 cells (Fig. 4E). Because SLC25A12, an aspartate–glutamate transporter localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) (26Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Saheki T. Satrústegui J. Palmieri F. Citrin and aralar1 are Ca2+-stimulated aspartate/glutamate transporters in mitochondria.EMBO J. 2001; 20 (11566871): 5060-506910.1093/emboj/20.18.5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), is required for regulating antiviral signaling through MAVS, it is likely that SLC25A12 acts downstream of MAVS in the pathway. While exploring the mechanisms of action of SLC25A12, we found that the transporter co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous MAVS in HEK293 cells under physiologic conditions (Fig. 5A). We therefore performed a structure–function analysis to fill the topologic gap between SLC25A12 and MAVS. Using a co-immunoprecipitation approach, we mapped the region of SLC25A12 that interacts with MAVS via the C-terminal region (Fig. 5B) that faces the intermembrane space (IMS) with an unknown function (27Thangaratnarajah C. Ruprecht J.J. Kunji E.R. Calcium-induced conformational changes of the regulatory domain of human mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carriers.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (25410934): 549110.1038/ncomms6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consistent with the immunoprecipitation results, fluorescence microscopy confirmed the co-localization of both SLC25A12 and MAVS in HeLa cells (Fig. 5C). We explored additional molecules that might bridge SLC25A12 and MAVS at the IMS and found that prohibitins (PHB1 and PHB2), mitochondrial scaffolds localized in the MIM (28Yoshinaka T. Kosako H. Yoshizumi T. Furukawa R. Hirano Y. Kuge O. Tamada T. Koshiba T.

We assume that SLC25A12, as a part of the PHB interactome (28Yoshinaka T. Kosako H. Yoshizumi T. Furukawa R. Hirano Y. Kuge O. Tamada T. Koshiba T.

Interestingly, decreasing SLC25A12 in cells affected the structural features of the MAVS activation accompanied by RLR-mediated signal transduction, i.e. homotypic oligomerization (29Hou F. Sun L. Zheng H. Skaug B. Jiang Q.-X. Chen Z.J.

In addition, SLC25A12-specific siRNA had no effect on IFN-β reporter activation in response to the overexpression of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) (Fig. S3B), a kinase that targets IRF-3, despite the fact that the effector acts downstream of MAVS (9Seth R.B.

On the basis of these findings, we propose a model in which SLC25A12 inhibits the RLR pathway downstream of MAVS (and/or at the same level) and upstream of the kinase TBK-1.

As little is known about the effects of smoking on TSH, TPOAb and TgAb in Chinese residents. This study aimed to evaluate the association between cigarette smoking and TSH, TPOAb and TgAb in ten-city residents of China. Study design This was a population-based cross-sectional study. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 15,181 subjects from ten major cities of China were investigated. Data regarding demographic characteristics, smoking status and consumption of iodine status were collected using in-person interviews based on a self-designed structured questionnaire. Serum concentrations of TSH, TPOAb and TgAb were measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Univariate analysis and multivariate linear stepwise regression analyses were used to analyze the data. Results The regular smokers had lower concentrations of TSH, TPOAb and TgAb than occasional smokers, former smokers and never smokers. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that regular smoking was associated with the decreased concentrations of TSH (β = -0.178), TPOAb (β = -0.287) and TGAb (β = -0.453) after adjusting other factors. Furthermore, daily smoking number was significantly associated with the decreased level of TSH (β = -0.045) and TPOAb(β = -0.080), and smoking duration was associated with the decreased TSH level (β = -0.030). Conclusions Our findings suggest that cigarette smoking is related to a significant decline in the concentrations of TSH, TPOAb and TgAb. In addition, daily smoking number and long-term smoking decrease serum TSH and TPOAb levels. Cigarette smoking plays a significant role in the development of thyroid dysfunction."

Recently, new purified and soluble preparations have been developed in an attempt to increase their biological actions. Two YCW preparations, one conventional and another with higher solubility of the mannan oligosaccharide fraction, were evaluated on dogs. One food formulation was used, divided into the following treatments: CON-control, without yeast cell wall addition; YCW-addition of 0.3% of a conventional yeas cell wall extract; YCWs-addition of 0.3% of a yeast cell wall extract with high mannan oligosaccharide solubility. Twenty-four beagle dogs were used, eight per food, distributed on a block design. Blocks lasted 32 days, and TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10, ex vivo production of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide by peripheral neutrophils and monocytes, phagocytic index, and fecal IgA were evaluated at the beginning and end of each period. Additionally, nutrient digestibility, feces production and quality, and fermentation products were quantified. The results were evaluated by analysis of variance and compared using the Tukey test (P<0.05), using the basal immunological parameters as a covariate. The inclusion of YCWs reduced fat digestibility (P<0.05), increased the concentration of butyrate and putrescine, and reduced lactate in feces (P<0.05), showing that mannan oligosaccharide solubilization resulted in higher fermentation of this compound and altered the metabolism of the gut microbiota. Lower IL-6 on serum was verified for dogs fed the YCWs diet (P<0.05), suggesting a reduction in the inflammatory activity of dogs. Higher phagocytic index was verified for peripheral monocytes after the intake of the YCW food, suggesting better innate immunity. In conclusion, the solubilization of the mannooligosaccharide fraction alters its interaction with gut microbiota and biological actions in animals, although both yeast cell wall preparations exhibited prebiotic effects on dogs."

https://openalex.org/W2990795296,"Background Healthcare professionals and students of medical faculties in Poland increasingly encounter culturally diverse patients. It is necessary to support the development of cultural intelligence in order to improve the medical care provided to patients from different cultural backgrounds. At present there are no standardized tools in Poland that can accurately and reliably assess cultural intelligence, which is defined by Ang et al. as “an individual’s capability to function and manage effectively in culturally diverse settings”. As argued in the present paper, this (cap)ability may be important for providing patient-centred care that is culturally adequate and competent. Purpose The aim of the research was to show the multistage process of validation of the Polish version of The Cultural Intelligence Scale by Ang et al. and Van Dyne et. al. Methods Across two studies we examined the psychometric properties of the Cultural Intelligence Scale, including reliability (i.e. internal consistency, test-retest reliability, factor structure) and validity (i.e. theoretical, criteria, convergent). In the first two-session study, 349 participants (98% were healthcare professionals, e.g. nurse, student nurse, medical student; mainly women, 89%) completed the Polish version of the Cultural Intelligence Scale twice with an interval of at least 22 days. In addition, across two study sessions participants completed questionnaires constructed to measure (a) cultural competence, (b) need for cognitive closure, (c) emphatic sensitiveness, (d) emotional intelligence, (e) self-esteem, (f) social desirability, (g) personality, and (h) positive/negative attitudes towards culturally divergent people. Finally, to additionally examine the theoretical validity, 36 professional cross-cultural competence trainers completed the Cultural Intelligence Scale during a one-session study. Results The Cultural Intelligence Scale has been shown to have satisfactory psychometric properties. It has high reliability (Cronbach’s alpha, respectively .94 and .95 in the first and second sessions) and the factor structure seems to approach the postulated one. Theoretical and criterion accuracy are well proven; convergence is less straightforward, but it correlates well with tools that examine variables such as cultural competence, cognitive closure, empathy/emphatic sensitiveness, emotional intelligence, self-esteem, personality, and social desirability. The results suggest that these factors contribute to the development of the cultural intelligence. Conclusion The Cultural Intelligence Scale can be successfully used in empirical research of cultural intelligence of medical professionals and students of medical majors and their education in Polish conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2991051023,"Proton radiotherapy using minibeams of sub-millimeter dimensions reduces side effects in comparison to conventional proton therapy due to spatial fractionation. Since the proton minibeams widen with depth, the homogeneous irradiation of a tumor can be ensured by adjusting the beam distances to tumor size and depth to maintain tumor control as in conventional proton therapy. The inherent advantages of protons in comparison to photons like a limited range that prevents a dosage of distal tissues are maintained by proton minibeams and can even be exploited for interlacing from different beam directions. A first animal study was conducted to systematically investigate and quantify the tissue-sparing effects of proton pencil minibeams as a function of beam size and dose distributions, using beam widths between σ = 95, 199, 306, 411, 561 and 883 μm (standard deviation) at a defined center-to-center beam distance (ctc) of 1.8 mm. The average dose of 60 Gy was distributed in 4x4 minibeams using 20 MeV protons (LET ~ 2.7 keV/μm). The induced radiation toxicities were measured by visible skin reactions and ear swelling for 90 days after irradiation. The largest applied beam size to ctc ratio (σ/ctc = 0.49) is similar to a homogeneous irradiation and leads to a significant 3-fold ear thickness increase compared to the control group. Erythema and desquamation was also increased significantly 3–4 weeks after irradiation. With decreasing beam sizes and thus decreasing σ/ctc, the maximum skin reactions are strongly reduced until no ear swelling or other visible skin reactions should occur for σ/ctc < 0.032 (extrapolated from data). These results demonstrate that proton pencil minibeam radiotherapy has better tissue-sparing for smaller σ/ctc, corresponding to larger peak-to-valley dose ratios PVDR, with the best effect for σ/ctc < 0.032. However, even quite large σ/ctc (e.g. σ/ctc = 0.23 or 0.31, i.e. PVDR = 10 or 2.7) show less acute side effects than a homogeneous dose distribution. This suggests that proton minibeam therapy spares healthy tissue not only in the skin but even for dose distributions appearing in deeper layers close to the tumor enhancing its benefits for clinical proton therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2991630073,"Background Chronic inflammation is known to be associated with both rotator cuff tears (RCTs) and depression. However, no epidemiological studies with a longitudinal follow-up have been performed to prove this association. We aimed to investigate whether depressed patients had an elevated risk of RCT and subsequent repair surgery compared with those without depression. Methods This retrospective cohort study comprised of patients diagnosed with depression between 2000 and 2010 (depression cohort) and patients without depression (non-depression cohort, 1:2 age and sex matched). The risk of RCT and rotator cuff repair surgery were determined during a 13-year follow-up (2000–2013) between these two cohorts. Results This study included 26,868 patients with depression and 53,736 patients without depression. The incidence of RCT was 648 and 438 per 100,000 person-years in the depression and non-depression cohorts, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 1.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36–1.57) for depressed patients. The incidence of rotator cuff repair surgery was 28 and 18 per 100,000 person-years in the depression and non-depression cohorts, respectively. Depressed patients also had a significantly increased risk of subsequent rotator cuff repair surgery (adjusted HR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.04–2.06). Conclusion The present study showed that depression was associated with an increased risk of rotator cuff tear and rotator cuff repair surgery."

Methods Firstly, HHIP gene expression data of NSCLC tissues and normal tissues were obtained from GSE18842/GSE19804/GSE43458 databases of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and then validated by TCGA NSCLC database in a cohort of 1027 cases of NSCLC patients and 108 cases of normal people. A chi-square test was used to analyze the relationship between HHIP expression and clinicopathological characteristics of NSCLC. The expression levels of HHIP in NSCLC cells were detected by quantitative-real time PCR. The function of HHIP was investigated by a series of in vitro assays. CCK-8, wounding healing, Transwell invasion assay were utilized to explore the mechanisms of HHIP. Results HHIP mRNA were significantly down-regulated in NSCLC in three GEO databases and TCGA database (P<0.05). This result was confirmed in NSCLC cell lines by qRT-PCR analysis, its expression in normal NSCLC cell line BEAS-2B was significantly higher than that in NSCLC cells. Chi-square test results showed that the low expression of HHIP was correlated with gender, cancer type, TNM stage and tumor size. Functional experimental results showed that over-expressing HHIP significantly decreased the ability of cell proliferation, migration and invasion in NSCLC cells (P<0.05). Conclusion Overall, the above results indicated that HHIP could regulate proliferation, migration and invasion, and could be used as a judging criterion for identifying NSCLC classification and stage."
https://openalex.org/W2991156850,"Schistosomiasis is caused by a trematode of the genus Schistosoma and affects over 200 million people worldwide. The only drug recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment and control of schistosomiasis is praziquantel. Development of new drugs is therefore of great importance. Thiazoles are regarded as privileged structures with a broad spectrum of activities and are potential sources of new drug prototypes, since they can act through interactions with DNA and inhibition of DNA synthesis. In this context, we report the synthesis of a series of thiazole derivatives and their in vitro schistosomicidal activity by testing eight molecules (NJ03-08; NJ11-12) containing thiazole structures. Parameters such as motility and mortality, egg laying, pairing and parasite viability by ATP quantification, which were influenced by these compounds, were evaluated during the assays. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilized for evaluation of morphological changes in the tegument. Schistosomula and adult worms were treated in vitro with different concentrations (6.25 to 50 μM) of the thiazoles for up to 5 and 3 days, respectively. After in vitro treatment for five days with 6.25 μM NJ05 or NJ07 separately, we observed a decrease of 30% in schistosomula viability, whilst treatment with NJ05+NJ07 lead to a reduction of 75% in viability measured by ATP quantitation and propidium iodide labeling. Adult worms' treatment with 50 μM NJ05, NJ07 or NJ05 + NJ07 showed decreased motility to 30-50% compared with controls. Compound NJ05 was more effective than NJ07, and adult worm viability after three days was reduced to 25% in parasites treated with 50 μM NJ05, compared with a viability reduction to 40% with 50 μM NJ07. SEM analysis showed severe alterations in adult worms with formation of bulges and blisters throughout the dorsal region of parasites treated with NJ05 or NJ07. Oviposition was extremely affected by treatment with the NJ series compounds; at concentrations of 25 μM and 50 μM, oviposition reached almost zero with NJ05, NJ07 or NJ05 + NJ07 already at day one. Tested genes involved in egg biosynthesis were all confirmed by qPCR as downregulated in females treated with 25 μM NJ05 for 2 days, with a significant reduction in expression of p14, Tyrosinase 2, p48 and fs800. NJ05, NJ07 or NJ05+NJ07 treatment of HEK293 (human embryonic cell line) and HES (human epithelial cell line) showed EC50 in the range of 18.42 to 145.20 μM. Overall, our results demonstrate that those molecules are suitable targets for further development into new drugs for schistosomiasis treatment, although progress is needed to lessen the cytotoxic effects on human cells. According to the present study, thiazole derivatives have schistosomicidal activities and may be part of a possible new arsenal of compounds against schistosomiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2989957461,"Introduction Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (IFAS) services are currently provided free of charge to pregnant women in Kenya during antenatal care (ANC) but compliance remains low. Poor awareness is an important factor contributing to low utilization of IFAS. Inadequate counselling is one of the key factors associated with poor awareness on IFAS. Community based health education is a promising diversification strategy for IFAS health education to curb this problem. Objectives To determine effect of community based IFAS health education, utilizing CHVs, on IFAS knowledge, levels of counselling on various IFAS topics and attitude towards IFAS among pregnant women in Kiambu County. Methodology A Pretest-Posttest Quasi-Experimental study design, consisting of intervention and control group, was applied among 340 pregnant women 18–49 years, in five health facilities, selected using two stage sampling in Lari Sub-County, Kiambu County, Kenya. Community health volunteers provided IFAS health education with weekly supplements and follow-ups to pregnant women in intervention group, while control group received the same from health care providers. Baseline and endline data were collected during ANC and compared. Quantitative data was analyzed using STATA version 14. Analysis of effect of intervention was done using Difference-In-Difference approach. Results There was an effect difference in maternal IFAS knowledge of 13%, with intervention group levels increasing most by 35 percentage points. The odds of being knowledgeable were 3 times more at endline than baseline. There was significant (p<0.001) change in proportion with positive attitude towards IFAS: the odds of having positive attitude at endline was 9 times that of baseline (OR = 9.2:95%CI 3.1, 27.2). Conclusion Implementation of community based health education improved maternal knowledge, positive attitude and proportion of pregnant women counselled on IFAS, better improvement being recorded in intervention group. Hence, there is need to integrate community based approach with antenatal IFAS distribution to improve supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W2990801422,"Vachellia and Senegalia are the most important genera in the subfamily Mimosoideae (Fabaceae). Recently, species from both genera were separated from the long-characterized Acacia due to their macro-morphological characteristics. However, this morpho-taxonomic differentiation struggles to discriminate some species, for example, Vachellia nilotica and Senegalia senegal. Therefore, sequencing the chloroplast (cp) genomes of these species and determining their phylogenetic placement via conserved genes may help to validate the taxonomy. Hence, we sequenced the cp genomes of V. nilotica and S. senegal, and the results showed that the sizes of the genomes are 165.3 and 162.7 kb, respectively. The cp genomes of both species comprised large single-copy regions (93,849~91,791 bp) and pairs of inverted repeats (IR; 26,093~26,008 bp). The total numbers of genes found in the V. nilotica and S. senegal cp genomes were 135 and 132, respectively. Approximately 123:130 repeats and 290:281 simple sequence repeats were found in the S. senegal and V. nilotica cp genomes, respectively. Genomic characterization was undertaken by comparing these genomes with those of 17 species belonging to related genera in Fabaceae. A phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome dataset and 56 shared genes was undertaken by generating cladograms with the same topologies and placing both species in a new generic system. These results support the likelihood of identifying segregate genera from Acacia with phylogenomic disposition of both V. nilotica and S. senegal in the subfamily Mimosoideae. The current study is the first to obtain complete genomic information on both species and may help to elucidate the genome architecture of these species and evaluate the genetic diversity among species."
https://openalex.org/W2989768530,"Purpose To translate and apply a cross-cultural adaptation of the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS) in Swedish and investigate its absolute and relative reliability. Methods The original EBPAS (a questionnaire assessing health professionals’ attitudes to implementation of evidence-based practice) was translated into Swedish using a forward and backward procedure, including a group discussion and expert committee. To assess reliability, 55 physiotherapists (48 women) aged 23–64 years from different clinical settings in the Stockholm region answered the EBPAS by postal survey twice within an interval of 2 weeks. Results The Cronbach’s alpha values for EBPAS were >0.721. The intraclass correlation (ICC) between test and retest (relative reliability) was moderate to good for the four subscales, with ICC(A.1) and ICC(C.1) values approximately equal and in the range 0.56–0.89. Values for the absolute reliability of the mean score were a standard error of measurement of about 7% and a smallest real difference of about 19%. Conclusion The Swedish version of the EBPAS shows mainly good reliability."
https://openalex.org/W2990348845,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of chromatin-related biological processes. The method, however, requires thousands of cells and has therefore limited applications in situations where cell numbers are limited. Here we describe a novel method called Restriction Assisted Tagmentation Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (RAT-ChIP) that enables global histone modification profiling from as few as 100 cells. The method is simple, cost-effective and takes a single day to complete. We demonstrate the sensitivity of the method by deriving the first genome-wide maps of histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications of inner cell mass and trophectoderm of bovine blastocyst stage embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2990406796,"On August 3rd, 2017, a Q fever outbreak alert was issued at a courier company that in addition to urgent freight transport offered pet delivery services. The epidemiological investigation set the exposition period between June 1 and August 8. In this period, 180 workers from two operational platforms for parcel distribution located in two provinces of the Basque Country (Bizkaia and Araba) were exposed; 64 filled a questionnaire and provided blood samples for serological testing, resulting in 10 confirmed cases (15.6%) and six (9.4%) probable cases. Nine workers (8 confirmed and 1 probable) showed Q fever symptoms, including pneumonia (five cases), and required medical care services, including one hospital admission. The attack rate was 25% (16/64), being higher among workers that visited the Bizkaia platform. This suggested that the origin of the outbreak was in the Bizkaia platform, where animals in transit waited at a pet holding site until being moved to their destination. Environmental samples consisting on 19 surface dust and two aerosol samples were collected at the Bizkaia platform to investigate the presence of C. burnetti DNA. All dust samples were positive by real time PCR, the lowest Ct values being found in dust collected at the pet holding facilities, and therefore suggesting that contamination originated at the pet holding site. The genotype identified in dust was SNP1/MST13, one of the most commonly identified genotypes in goats and sheep in the Basque Country. During the exposure period, two deliveries of miniature goats were made, of which only one could be investigated and tested negative. Although the contamination source could not be unequivocally identified, transport of ruminants was banned at the company, and Q fever was included among the occupational-associated health risks."
https://openalex.org/W2990772859,"Obstetric trends show changes in complication rates and maternal characteristics such as caesarean section, induced labour, and maternal age. To what degree such general time trends and changing patterns of antiepileptic drug use influence pregnancies of women with epilepsy (WWE) is unknown. Our aim was to describe changes in maternal characteristics and obstetric complications in WWE over time, and to assess changes in complication risks in WWE relative to women without epilepsy.This was a nationwide cohort study of all first births in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, 1999-2016. We estimated maternal characteristics, complication rates, and risks for WWE compared to women without epilepsy. Main maternal outcome measures were hypertensive disorders, bleeding in pregnancy, induction of labour, caesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, preterm birth, small for gestational age, and epidural analgesia. Time trends were analyzed by logistic regression and comparisons made with interaction analyses.426 347 first births were analyzed, and 3077 (0.7%) women had epilepsy. In WWE there was an increase in proportions of induced labour (p<0.005) and use of epidural analgesia (p<0.005), and a reduction in mild preeclampsia (p = 0.006). However, the risk of these outcomes did not change over time. Only the risk of severe preeclampsia increased significantly over time relative to women without epilepsy (p = 0.006). In WWE, folic acid supplementation increased significantly over time (p<0.005), and there was a decrease in smoking during pregnancy (p<0.005), but these changes were less pronounced than for women without epilepsy (p<0.005).During 1999-2016 there were important changes in maternal characteristics and complication rates among WWE. However, outcome risks for WWE relative to women without epilepsy did not change despite changes in antiepileptic drug use patterns. The relative risk of severe preeclampsia increased in women with epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2991149171,"Purpose To assess the clinical utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the diagnosis of patients with optic atrophy (OA). Design Retrospective cohort study. Methods 97 patients were referred to the McMaster University Medical Center (Hamilton, Ontario) for evaluation of bilateral OA. All patients were sent for NGS including a 22 nuclear gene panel and/or complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing. Positive genetic test results and abnormal vibration sensation were compared in patients +/- environmental exposures or a family history. Results 19/94 (20.2%) had a positive nuclear variant, of which 15/19 (78.9%) were in the OPA1 gene. No positive mtDNA variants were identified. The detection of a positive genetic variant was significantly different in patients who reported excessive ethanol use, but not in patients who smoke (0/19 (0%) vs. 19/78 (24.4%), P = 0.0164 and 4/22 (18.2%) vs. 15/74 (20.3%), P = 0.829, respectively). Patients with a positive family history were more likely to have a positive genetic variant compared to patients with a negative family history (P = 0.0112). There were significantly more excessive drinkers with an abnormal vibration sensation (P = 0.026), and with a similar trend in smokers (P = 0.074). Conclusions All positive genetic variants were identified in nuclear genes. We identified a potential independent pathophysiological link between a history of excessive ethanol consumption and bilateral OA. Further investigations should evaluate and identify potential environmental risk factors for OA."
https://openalex.org/W2991507183,"Insulated sandwich concrete panel (ISCP) is widely used because of its high thermal insulation efficiency and low construction cost. Aiming at improving traditional ISCP, a new cast-in-situ concrete wall structure made of ISCP is proposed, which is composed of thin-walled cold-formed steels, slant steel wire connectors, steel wire meshes, concrete layers, expanded polystyrene sheets and reinforced concrete embedded columns. In order to assess the hysteretic properties of the new insulated sandwich concrete wall and the influence of various parameters, low-frequency horizontal cyclic load tests were carried out on seven full-scale specimens of new type cast-in-situ insulated sandwich concrete wall. The specimens were compared and analyzed with respect to failure mode, bearing capacity, ductility, degradation characteristics and energy dissipation capacity. The results show that the final failure pattern of the specimen is two main diagonal cracks intersecting each other; the bearing capacity is greatly affected by concrete thickness and axial compression ratio, regardless of concrete strength. Brittle failure is typically observed when the steel wire spacing is large, while ductility is pronounced when the concrete layer thickness is small and the concrete strength is low; the smaller the thickness of concrete layer, the faster the stiffness degrades. The wall structure shows a better energy dissipation performance with a smaller steel wire spacing, lower concrete strength and smaller axial compression ratio."

https://openalex.org/W2991162307,"Rare diseases defined by genetic mutations are classic targets for gene therapy. More recently, researchers expanded the use of gene therapy in non-clinical studies to infectious diseases through the delivery of vectorized antibodies to well-defined antigens. Here, we further extend the utility of gene therapy beyond the “accepted” indications to include organophosphate poisoning. There are no approved preventives for the multi-organ damage resulting from acute or chronic exposure to organophosphates. We show that a single intramuscular injection of adeno-associated virus vector produces peak expression (~0.5 mg/ml) of active human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) in mice serum within 3–4 weeks post-treatment. This expression is sustained for up to 140 days post-injection with no silencing. Sustained expression of hBChE provided dose-dependent protection against VX in male and female mice despite detectable antibodies to hBChE in some mice, thereby demonstrating that expression of hBChE in vivo in mouse muscle is an effective prophylactic against organophosphate poisoning."

The 7-Step Pathway Resuscitation Plan and Alert form (7-Step form) is one example of a resuscitation plan. Treatment recommendations in resuscitation plans currently lack standardised language, creating potential for misinterpretation and patient harm.To explore how terminology used in resuscitation plans is interpreted and applied by clinicians.A mixed methods study surveyed 50 general medical doctors, who were required to interpret and apply a 7-Step form in three case vignettes and define seven key terms. Statistical analysis on multiple choice and thematic analysis on free-text responses was performed.Terminology was inconsistently interpreted and inconsistently applied, resulting in clinically significant differences in treatment choices. Three key themes influenced the application of a resuscitation plan: in-depth discussion, precise documentation and personal experience of the bedside deciding doctor.This study highlights persistent communication deficiencies in resuscitation plan documentation and how this may adversely affect patient care; findings unlikely to be unique to Australia or South Australia.Removing ambiguity by standardising and defining the terminology in resuscitation plans will improve bedside decision-making, while also supporting the rights of the patient to receive appropriate and desired care."
https://openalex.org/W2990873187,"Fertilizer is applied widely to improve the productivity of plantations. Traditionally, fertilization is conducted in spring and/or in the early rainy season, and it is believed to support the growth of planted trees in the growing season. Little attention to date has been paid on identification of the optimal timing of fertilization and fertilizer dose. In this study, application of the fine root monitoring technique in identifying optimal fertilization timing for an Acacia plantation in Vietnam is described. The study used two fertilizer doses (100 and 200 g NPK/tree) and three fertilization timings (in spring; in the early rainy season; and based on the fine root monitoring technique to identify when the fine roots reach their growth peak). As expected fertilization timings significantly affected growth and above-ground biomass (AGB) of the plantation. Fertilization based on the fine root monitoring technique resulted in the highest growths and AGB, followed by fertilization in the early rainy season and then in spring. Applying fertilizer at 200 g NPK/tree based on the fine root monitoring technique increased diameter at breast height (DBH) by 16%, stem height by 8%, crown diameter (Dc) by 16%, and AGB by 40% as compared to early rainy season fertilization. Increases of 32% DBH, 23% stem height, 44% Dc, and 87% AGB were found in fertilization based on fine root monitoring technique compared to spring fertilization. This study concluded that forest growers should use the fine root monitoring technique to identify optimal fertilization timing for higher productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2990038570,"The capacity to utilize ingested protein for optimal support of protein synthesis and lean body mass is described within the paradigm of anabolic competence. Protein synthesis can be stimulated by physical exercise, however, it is not known if physical exercise affects post-exercise protein oxidation. Characterization of the driving forces behind protein oxidation, such as exercise, can contribute to improved understanding of whole body protein metabolism. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of two levels of aerobic exercise intensity on immediate post-exercise exogenous protein oxidation. Sixteen healthy males with a mean (SD) age of 24 (4) years participated. The subjects' VO2-max was estimated with the Åstrand cycling test. Habitual dietary intake was assessed with a three-day food diary. Exogenous protein oxidation was measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. These measurements were initiated after the ingestion of a 30 g 13C-milk protein test drink that was followed by 330 minutes breath sample collection. On three different days with at least one week in between, exogenous protein oxidation was measured: 1) during rest, 2) after 15 minutes of aerobic exercise at 30% of VO2-max (moderate intensity), and 3) after 15 minutes of aerobic exercise at 60% of VO2-max (vigorous intensity). After vigorous intensity aerobic exercise, 31.8%±8.0 of the 30 g 13C-milk protein was oxidized compared to 26.2%±7.1 during resting condition (p = 0.012), and 25.4%±7.6 after moderate intensity aerobic exercise compared to resting (p = 0.711). In conclusion, exogenous protein oxidation is increased after vigorous intensity aerobic exercise which could be the result of an increased protein turnover rate."
https://openalex.org/W2991319224,"Acute infection with Plasmodium vivax, classically associated with benign disease, has been presenting as serious and even fatal disease in recent years. Severe disease is mainly due to biochemical and hematological alterations during the acute phase of infection. In the present cross-sectional study, the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) was evaluated as a method for identifying patients at risk of severe vivax malaria. This retrospective study included 130 patients with confirmed P. vivax infection between June 2006 and January 2018. Clinical-epidemiological data were obtained from medical records. Hematological and biochemical parameters were determined using automated equipment. The criteria of severity for infection by Plasmodium falciparum, established by the World Health Organization (WHO), were adapted to classify patients with danger signs of severe vivax malaria. Of the 130 patient's records evaluated, 19 (14.6%) had one or more signs and symptoms of severe malaria. The mean APRI values among patients with and without severe malaria were 2.11 and 1.09, respectively (p = 0.044). Among those with severe disease, the proportion with an APRI value above 1.50 was 30% compared to the 10% among those without severe disease (p = 0.007). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% CI), calculated to assess the accuracy of the APRI in discriminating between patients with and without severe disease, was 0.645 (0.494; 0.795). An APRI cutoff of 0.74 resulted in sensitivity of 74.0%, specificity of 56.0%, and accuracy of 65.0%. This study shows that the APRI is elevated in patients with evidence of infection by P. vivax. Based on the good sensitivity found in this study, we conclude that this simple index can serve as a diagnostic biomarker to identify patients at risk of severe disease during the acute phase of P. vivax infection."
https://openalex.org/W2989901885,"Objectives Vitamin supplementation reduces pemetrexed toxicity. Raised plasma homocysteine reflects deficiency in vitamin B12 and folate, and is suppressed by supplementation. This observational study of 112 patients receiving pemetrexed-based chemotherapy assessed homocysteine levels after 3 weeks of vitamin supplementation, hypothesising high levels would correlate with ongoing deficiency, thus increased toxicity. Material and methods Primary endpoint was the composite of proportion of patients with treatment delay/ dose reduction/ drug change or hospitalisation during the first six weeks of chemotherapy, comparing those with normal plasma homocysteine (successfully supplemented, SS) and those with high homocysteine (unsuccessfully supplemented, USS). Secondary endpoints included toxicity and analyses for depression. Post-hoc analysis examined correlation between interval of vitamin and folate supplementation and pemetrexed on primary endpoint and grade 3–4 toxicities. Results Eighty-four patients (84%) were successfully supplemented (SS group). The proportion of patients undergoing a treatment delay/ dose reduction/ drug change or hospitalisation in SS group was 44.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.2%–55.3%) and in USS group was 18.8% (95% CI 4.0%–45.6%) (p = 0.09). Twelve percent of patients gave a past history of depression however 66% of patients had an on study Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) score of >7. Supplementation status was not associated with depression. The median overall survival (OS) was 11.8 months (95% CI 8.6–16.5) in the SS group and 8.8 months (95% CI 6.6–16.2) in the US group (p = 0.5). The number of days (<7 or ≥ 7 days) between vitamin B12 and folate initiation and pemetrexed administration, had no effect on the primary endpoint and grade 3–4 toxicities. Conclusion On-treatment homocysteine levels were not a biomarker of toxicity or depression. Standard vitamin supplementation is adequate in the majority of patients receiving pemetrexed. High HAD score were noted in this population giving an opportunity for mental health intervention. The lead-in time for vitamin supplementation can be short."

Also, no study to date has provided reference-based standards for relative schoolbag weight. Therefore, the main purpose of the study was to establish normative values of relative schoolbag weight in a sample of children. In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 584 primary school students aged 6-14 (meanage±SD = 9.6±2.4 yrs, meanheight±SD = 1.4±0.2 m, meanweight±SD = 37.5±13.3 kg, meanbody-mass index±SD = 17.6±3.1 kg/m2, 44.4% girls) chosen from five schools in the city of Brno. Schoolbag weight and child's body weight were objectively measured by using digital scale. Relative schoolbag weight was calculated by dividing schoolbag weight with child's body weight and the result was expressed in percentage. Lambda, Mu and Sigma (LMS) method was used to create sex- and age-percentile curves. Boys carried slightly heavier schoolbag, compared with girls (mean difference 0.2 kg, p = 0.020). No significant differences between sexes in relative schoolbag weight were observed (p = 0.240). Median values (P50) for boys and girls were similar and the largest observed between ages 6-9 in boys (15-17%) and 6-8 in girls (16-18%). The percentage of children carrying relative schoolbag weight beyond 10% of their body weight was very high, especially between ages 6-10 in boys (85.1-100%) and 6-11 in girls (86.8-95.4%). This study provides first sex- and age- relative schoolbag weight normative values in primary school children. Future studies should use similar methods for generating comparable data."
https://openalex.org/W2989668888,"We present a new approach to characterizing the global geometric state of chromatin from HiC data. Chromatin conformation capture techniques (3C, and its variants: 4C, 5C, HiC, etc.) probe the spatial structure of the genome by identifying physical contacts between genomic loci within the nuclear space. In whole-genome conformation capture (HiC) experiments, the signal can be interpreted as spatial proximity between genomic loci and physical distances can be estimated from the data. However, observed spatial proximity signal does not directly translate into persistent contacts within the nuclear space. Attempts to infer a single conformation of the genome within the nuclear space lead to internal geometric inconsistencies, notoriously violating the triangle inequality. These inconsistencies have been attributed to the stochastic nature of chromatin conformation or to experimental artifacts. Here we demonstrate that it can be explained by a mixture of cells, each in one of only several conformational states, contained in the sample. We have developed and implemented a graph-theoretic approach that identifies the properties of such postulated subpopulations. We show that the geometrical conflicts in a standard yeast HiC dataset, can be explained by only a small number of homogeneous populations of cells (4 populations are sufficient to reconcile 95,000 most prominent impossible triangles, 8 populations can explain 375,000 top geometric conflicts). Finally, we analyze the functional annotations of genes differentially interacting between the populations, suggesting that each inferred subpopulation may be involved in a functionally different transcriptional program."
