https://openalex.org/W1570762629,"Retinal rod outer segments contain a phosphodiesterase specific for cyclic GMP. This enzyme is virtually inactive in the dark. Photoexcitation of rhodopsin results in the formation of hundreds of molecules of GTP-transducin, which in turn activate many molecules of phosphodiesterase. The phosphodiesterase is also known to be activated by the proteolytic action of trypsin. We have investigated the nature of the inhibitory constraint on the catalytic activity of the phosphodiesterase in the dark state. Phosphodiesterase purified by hexylagarose chromatography followed by gel filtration high pressure liquid chromatography consists of three kinds of subunits: alpha (88 kilodaltons), beta (84 kilodaltons), and gamma (11 kilodaltons). Three lines of evidence show that the phosphodiesterase in the dark state is inhibited by its gamma subunit. First, inhibitor activity copurifies with the catalytic activity of this enzyme. Second, trypsin degrades the gamma subunit, resulting in a concomitant increase in catalytic activity. The high pressure liquid chromatography elution position of trypsin-activated phosphodiesterase suggests that it is an alpha beta complex. Third, nearly all of the catalytic activity of trypsin-activated phosphodiesterase can be inhibited by the addition of gamma subunit purified either by heat treatment or by gel filtration at pH 2.1. The addition of gamma subunit to trypsin-activated phosphodiesterase decreases its Vmax from 1.2 mmol of cyclic GMP hydrolyzed/min/mg to less than 1% of this value with relatively little change in the value of Km. The gamma subunit has high affinity for trypsin-activated phosphodiesterase. The dissociation constant of this complex is 0.13 nM. These experiments show that the phosphodiesterase in the dark state has very little catalytic activity because of the inhibitory constraint imposed by its gamma subunit."

They exhibit not only time- and voltage-dependent Na+ and K+ conductances, analogous to those in the squid giant axon1, but also a variety of other conductances that have a significant role in the control of cell excitability. Of the outward currents, there are, in addition to the delayed rectifier, the Ca2+-activated K+ current2,3 which underlies the long-lasting spike afterhyperpolarization, and the M current4, a non-inactivating K+ current evoked by membrane depolarization and blocked by muscarinic, cholinergic agonists. We demonstrate here the existence in a mammalian central neurone (hip-pocampal CA3 pyramidal cells) of yet another outward current, which is transient and may be carried by K+ ions. Further, the experiments show that this current is substantially reduced by the convulsant 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)5, resulting in a marked increase in cell excitability."

https://openalex.org/W1591841427,"The temperature and pH dependence of the reaction of the superoxide radical anion with ferricytochrome c have been measured using the pulse-radiolysis technique. The temperature dependence of the reaction at low ionic strength yields an activation energy of 31 +/- 5 kJ/mol as compared to 14 +/- 3 kJ/mol for the reaction of CO2.(-) under the same conditions. The pH dependence fits the single pK'a of ferricytochrome c of 9.1. The bimolecular rate constant for the reaction of the superoxide anion with ferricytochrome c at pH 7.8, 21 +/- 2 degrees C, in the presence of 50 mM phosphate and 0.1 mM EDTA is (2.6 +/- 0.1) X 10(5) M-1 s-1. Using this value, 1 unit of superoxide dismutase activity (McCord, J. M., and Fridovich, I. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 6049-6055) is calculated to be 3.6 +/- 0.3 pmol of enzyme if the assay is performed in a total volume of 3.0 ml. Copper ions reduce the yield of the reaction of ferricytochrome c with CO2.(-). The reactivities of native and singly modified 4-carboxy-2,4-dinitrophenyllysine cytochromes c towards the superoxide anion radical are in the order native greater than 4-carboxy-2,4-dinitrophenyllysine 60 greater than lysine 13 greater than lysine 87 greater than lysine 27 greater than lysine 86 greater than lysine 72, indicating that electron transfer takes place at or close to the solvent accessible heme edge. The mechanism of the reaction is discussed in terms of the approach of superoxide anion radicals to the heme edge and the available molecular orbitals of both heme and free radicals."

https://openalex.org/W1661362421,"We have synthesized cDNA clones for maize zein proteins using mRNAs purified from developing endosperm. Analysis of these clones by in vitro translation of hybrid-selected mRNAs suggested differences in sequence homology among the mRNAs for the different molecular weight zein polypeptides. These differences were also apparent in restriction maps of clones corresponding to the Mr = 22,000, 19,000, and 15,000 zeins. Using radioactive cDNA inserts as probes, we measured the extent of sequence homology among zein clones with a sensitive dot hybridization procedure. By this analysis, it was possible to distinguish clones corresponding to the different molecular weight zeins at low (Tm - 49 degrees C) to moderate (Tm - 35 degrees C) criteria, while under more stringent conditions (Tm - 20 degrees C), distinctions could be made between zein sequences within a molecular weight group. This analysis distinguish three different mRNAs for each of the Mr = 22,000 and Mr = 19,000 zeins, but only one was detected for the Mr = 15,000 zein. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of clones for the Mr = 22,000 and Mr = 19,000 zeins showed about 60% homology throughout the coding regions. This analysis also revealed the presence of short repetitive nucleotide sequences corresponding to tandem repeats of approximately 20 amino acids in both groups of proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2151323478,"After fusion of small unilamellar phospholipid liposomes with mitochondrial inner membranes, the rate of electron transfer between membrane dehydrogenases and cytochrome c decreases as the average distance between integral membrane proteins increases, suggesting that electron transfer is mediated through a diffusional process in the membrane plane (Schneider, H., Lemasters, J. J., Hochli, M., and Hackenbrock, C. R. (1980)., J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3748-3756). The role of ubiquinone in this process was evaluated by fusing liposomes containing ubiquinone-10 or ubiquinone-6, with inner membranes. In control membranes enriched with phospholipid only, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase and NADH- and succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities decreased proportionally to the increase in bilayer lipid. These decreases were restored substantially in phospholipid plus ubiquinone-supplemented membranes. The degree to which restoration occurred was dependent upon the length of the isoprenoid side chain of the ubiquinone with the shorter chain length ubiquinone-6, always giving greater restoration than ubiquinone-10. It is concluded that electron transfer between flavin-linked dehydrogenases (Complexes I and II) and cytochrome bc1 (Complex III) occurs by independent, lateral diffusion of ubiquinone as well as independent, lateral diffusion of ubiquinone as well as the protein complexes within the plane of the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W150580789,"The modification and concomitant inactivation of the catalytic subunit of bovine heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase with affinity analogs of peptide substrates potentially capable of undergoing disulfide interchange with enzyme-bound sulfhydryl groups have been used to probe the active site associated with peptide binding. The regeneration of catalytic activity on treatment of the modified enzymes with dithiothreitol and the observation that prior reaction with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) blocks the modification of the kinase by these reagents are consistent with the proposal that only thiol residues are reacting. The affinity analog Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Cys(3-nitro-2-pyridinesulfenyl)-Leu-Gly, 1, and the closely related peptide AcLeu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Cys(3-nitro-2-pyridinesulfenyl)-Leu-Gly-OEt, 3, react with a single sulfhydryl as shown by the stoichiometry of the release of the 3-nitro-2-pyridinesulfenyl group and the amount of label incorporated in the enzyme when the radioactively labeled peptide analog of 3 (peptide 4) is employed as the modifying agent. The kinetics of the reaction of 1 with 4.3 microM catalytic subunit was monophasic (employing substrate in excess conditions), yielding an apparent value of KI of approximately 40 microM and a k2 value of approximately 0.25 s-1. The low value of the observed KI, together with the observation that protein kinase substrates inhibit the modification reactions, suggest strongly that the cysteine residue undergoing reaction is in the vicinity of the active site. By trypsin-catalyzed degradation and identification of the peptide segment modified by covalent attachment of the peptide portion of the radioactive analog 4, the single cysteine modified was identified as cysteine-198."

https://openalex.org/W1605605108,"We have found that the major excreted protein (MEP) of transformed mouse fibroblasts, a phosphoglycoprotein of Mr = 35,000, carries the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker. MEP secreted by Kirsten virus-transformed NIH 3T3 cells binds to a purified preparation of lysosomal enzyme phosphomannosyl receptor, and this binding is specifically inhibited by mannose 6-phosphate. 32Pi introduced into MEP by metabolic labeling of intact cells is exclusively associated with asparagine-linked oligosaccharides as indicated by sensitivity to endohexosaminidase H. Labeling studies utilizing [2-3H]mannose indicate that approximately one-fifth of the mannose residues of MEP are phosphorylated. Comparative studies of the synthesis, secretion, and uptake of MEP and the lysosomal enzyme beta-galactosidase indicate that MEP made by Kirsten virus-transformed NIH 3T3 cells is not handled in the same manner as are other lysosomal enzymes. MEP may be an unusual lysosomal protein, or both."

https://openalex.org/W2158543975,"The catalytic protein of rabbit hepatic adenylate cyclase, after chromatographic separation from the GTP-binding regulatory protein (G/F) (Ross, E. M. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1949-1953), is essentially free of endogenous phospholipids. This preparation is active in the presence of Mn2+ and is markedly stimulated by forskolin, but it is stimulated only slightly by the addition of purified G/F plus an activator (GTP gamma S or NaF). The ability of activator-liganded G/F to stimulate the activity of the resolved catalyst is increased up to 8-fold by the addition of either dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (0.3-1.5 mM optimal concentration) or several other phosphatidylcholines. Phosphatidylcholine stabilizes the catalyst to denaturation but has little effect on its basal activity or on its stimulation by Mn2+ or forskolin. It also had no stimulating effect on the activation of G/F by GTP gamma S. These data are interpreted as showing that phosphatidylcholine promotes or is required for the stimulatory interaction of activator-liganded G/F with the catalytic protein of adenylate cyclase. Lubrol 12A9, Triton X-100, cholate, lysophosphatidylcholine, digitonin, and phosphatidylserine could not substitute for phosphatidylcholine. The detergents inhibited stimulation by liganded G/F even in the presence of phosphatidylcholine. Removal of cholate from a mixture of soluble catalytic protein and phosphatidylcholine by dialysis and sucrose density gradient centrifugation caused the binding of catalytic protein to large unilamellar vesicles. This preparation was further reconstituted with increasing amounts of G/F to yield vesicles with varied G/F:catalyst ratios and similarly varied responses to G/F-mediated activating ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1492951128,"Renal brush-border membrane vesicles were irradiated in the frozen state with a high energy electron beam. The integral membrane proteins, alkaline phosphatase and 5'-nucleotidase, each showed a single exponential loss of activity with radiation dose, indicating target sizes of 67,000 and 58,000 daltons, respectively. Inactivation of sodium-dependent phlorizin binding to the brush-border membrane D-glucose transporter was more complex. One-half of the phlorizin binding sites were lost after even the smallest doses of radiation suggestive of large functional units (greater than 4 X 10(6) daltons) for a subpopulation of phlorizin binding proteins. The remaining sites behaved as a single radiation target of 110,000 +/- 8,000 daltons and retained the kinetic characteristics commonly associated with phlorizin binding to the glucose transporter. Thus, the data are consistent with the assignment of a molecular weight of 110,000 to the phlorizin binding moiety of the brush-border membrane D-glucose transport protein."
https://openalex.org/W2301599923,"Abstract 32P-labeled ATP-citrate lyase isolated from 32P-labeled hepatocytes treated with insulin contained 1.6-1.8-fold greater 32P-radioactivity per mg protein than control enzyme. Both enzyme preparations were digested in parallel with trypsin until 94% of all 32P-radioactivity was rendered acid soluble. Quantitative high performance liquid chromatographic peptide mapping of the tryptic digests revealed a principal 32P-peptide which accounted for at least 80% of the insulin induced increment in 32P-radioactivity of native lyase. This peptide was purified, sequenced, and the site of 32P-phosphorylation assigned by two methods: electrophoresis (pH 6.5) of residual peptide after each step of Edman degradation and solid phase sequencing. The site of insulin-directed phosphorylation of ATP-citrate lyase (Thr-Ala-Ser(32P)-Phe-Ser-Glu-Ser-Arg) is the same as that directed by glucagon, and, in turn, identical with that phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1536729586,"The role of the eucaryotic T-A-T-A box (Hogness box) homology sequence located approximately 30 base pairs upstream from the RNA initiation site has been further examined by oligodeoxynucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis. A method was employed which allows insertion of nucleotide-specific mutations into virtually any double-stranded, recombinant plasmid DNA. A synthetic mixed oligonucleotide, bearing defined multiple nucleotide substitutions at a single site, was used both as a specific mutagen during primed DNA repair synthesis in vitro, as well as a highly sensitive hybridization probe for the identification of the mutated cloned DNA. Using this methodology, an A leads to G transition mutation was introduced into the second position of the ovalbumin gene T-[A]-T-A box, and the effect of modifying this highly conserved nucleotide on the expression of the mutant DNA was analyzed in a cell-free transcription system. Comparison of two allelic ovalbumin genes, slightly divergent upstream from the TATA box, resulted in identical in vitro transcription efficiencies. While correct initiation of ovalbumin RNA transcripts was not affected, the efficiency of gene expression using the mutant template, compared to either the corresponding wild-type sequence or the allelic gene, was markedly reduced. These results suggest that it is the T-A-T-A box sequence which plays a role in the efficient initiation of RNA transcription in vitro and further supports the implication that this region may serve a promoter-related function in eucaryotic transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1548761499,"The addition of Mg2+ or ATP to (Na+,K+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) of pig kidney modified with a sulfhydryl fluorescent reagent N-[p-(2-benzimidazolyl)phenyl]maleimide simply reduced fluorescence in the presence of Na+; however, the addition of both ligands to the enzyme induced a reversible dynamic change. The direction of the change was dependent on the concentration of Na+ present. These dynamic changes in fluorescence intensity both in the presence of low and high concentrations of Na+ can be repeated by the re-addition of ATP but not by ADP. Addition of ouabain under the former condition stabilized the fluorescence at the highest level, but the addition of ouabain under the latter condition increased the fluorescence from the lowest to the highest level. The phosphoenzyme formed under the former condition was sensitive to K+ and insensitive to ADP while the phosphoenzyme formed under the latter condition was sensitive to ADP and insensitive to K+. The data indicate that the positive and negative fluorescence changes were induced by the formation of K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme and ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme, respectively. N-Ethylmaleimide treatment partially inhibited the positive change without affecting the negative change. These data also indicate that the transition of ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme to K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme accompanied the largest fluorescence intensity change which was examined during the hydrolysis of ATP. The data obtained from the tryptophan fluorescence of both the native and the modified enzyme suggest that the micro-environments of the tryptophan and the sulfhydryl residues are similar in the state of K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme but different in the state of ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1653512598,"Two mechanisms of Na+ influx have been observed using synaptosomal plasma membrane vesicles purified by density gradient centrifugation from a synaptosomal hypotonic lysate. First, a 5-fold increase in uptake over basal Na+ entry occurs with 50 microM veratridine. The veratridine-dependent Na+ uptake is partially inhibited by 2 microM tetrodotoxin with an apparent time dependency of action (half-maximal inhibition in approximately 20 min). Second, a larger Na+ accumulation (approximately 15-fold above basal) was observed with 2.5 mM ATP, this effect being dependent on internal K+ loading of vesicles although inhibited by high external K+. The two uptake processes are believed to represent operation of the plasma membrane voltage-sensitive Na+ channel, and the Na+-pumping (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, respectively. Both Na+ flux mechanisms appear to operate in a single population of vesicles since opening of the Na+ channel with veratridine diminishes the ATP-dependent accumulation of Na+ by over 75%. An inverted orientation of the plasma membrane vesicles is likely to account for the functioning of the ATP-dependent Na+ pump and may also account for the low sensitivity and time dependency of the inhibitory action of tetrodotoxin on Na+ channel-opening. Na+ accumulated by the Na+ pump was rapidly effluxed by 10 mM external Ca2+ via the Na+-Ca2+ exchange mechanism which (together with an ATP-dependent Ca2+-accumulating mechanism) was recently characterized in the vesicles (Gill, D. L., Grollman, E. F., and Kohn L. D. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 184-192). This result, together with the observed inhibition of Ca2+ influx via (Na+-Ca2+)-exchange due to veratridine-mediated Na+ flux, strongly suggests that the Na+ pump, Na+ channel, and both Ca2+ transport mechanisms function in a single population of inverted plasma membrane vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1587184757,"The existence of a cardiac carnitine binding protein was demonstrated using an in vitro binding assay. The binding activity was solubilized with Triton X-100 from the pellet following a 59,000 X g centrifugation of rat ventricular homogenates. Preincubation at temperatures above 40 degrees C or treatment with pronase significantly reduced the binding activity, suggesting that the activity was that of a protein. Cell fractionation studies suggested that the cardiac carnitine binding protein was associated with the plasma membrane fraction and that its activity was distinct from carnitine palmitoyl-transferase, carnitine acetyltransferase, and carnitine translocase. Optimal binding required 60 min of incubation at 25 degrees C. The binding of carnitine to the cardiac carnitine binding protein was saturable, and a dissociation constant of 0.7 microM for DL-carnitine was measured. L-Carnitine competed with DL-[methyl-3H]carnitine for competition by D-carnitine was much less effective. Binding was significantly inhibited when N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetic acid, or mercuric chloride was present. Once DL-[3H]carnitine was bound to the cardiac carnitine binding protein, radioactivity could be dissociated by a variety of mild treatments including dialysis, overnight incubation at 4 degrees C, and application to a gel filtration column."
https://openalex.org/W1606741593,"Chick embryo red blood cells express the embryonic globin and the rRNA genes before 5 days of development but only the adult globin genes and no rRNA after 12 days of development. We have isolated nuclei from the red blood cells of these developmental stages and allowed them to transcribe in vitro. We have analyzed the overall transcriptional properties of these nuclei, the overall activities of RNA polymerases I and II and the sequence-specific activity of RNA polymerase II in the beta-globin domain using cloned genomic hybridization probes. Among our findings are the following. 1) Erythroid nuclei of 5-day embryos are more transcriptionally active than those at 12 days. 2) RNA polymerase I is a very active at 5 days but is off by 12 days. 3) A template-independent activity which yields labeled RNA is present in the red cell nuclei of 12-day but not 5-day embryos. 4) Between 5 and 12 days of development transcriptional modulation delineates embryonic and adult beta-globin domains. 5) These domains exceed the boundaries of the genes themselves by several kilobases. 6) All transcripts which hybridize to sequences in the beta-globin gene region, including repeat sequence transcripts, are transcribed by RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1549440456,"The ATP analog 6-[(3-carboxy-4-nitrophenyl)thiol]-9-beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine 5'-triphosphate (Nbs6ITP) is slowly hydrolyzed at pH 7.4 by the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, whereas it binds covalently at pH 8.5 and inhibits the enzyme irreversibly. Time courses of irreversible inhibition could only be fitted to a model in which the enzyme can exist in two slowly interchangeable states, one of which is enzymatically active and binds Nbs6ITP first reversibly and then covalently. Arguments that the covalent binding occurs at a low affinity nucleotide binding site are: (a) similarity of the Ki Nbs6ITP for the reversible and the irreversible inhibition and of K0.5 for ATP protection; (b) stoichiometry of covalent Nbs6ITP binding per alpha subunit of 0.8; and (c) change of complex substrate dependence of the enzyme to a Michaelis-Menten type after Nbs6ITP modification. This change in kinetics and the finding that the Nbs6ITP inactivation at a low affinity nucleotide binding site is increased by micromolar ADP concentrations indicates that the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase contains two different nucleotide binding sites. Since studies of nucleotide effects on enzyme inactivation by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) did not confirm the hypothesis of an SH-group in a nucleotide binding site, Nbs6ITP may bind to another functional group, e.g. to an OH-group of tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W1532465898,"The seven tRNA genes clustered in the supB-E region of the Escherichia coli chromosome were transcribed in vitro with purified RNA polymerase, using a restriction fragment from lambda psu degrees 2, a transducing phage carrying the chromosome region, as template. A single major transcript was synthesized, which was about 770 nucleotides long and contained all seven tRNA sequences. The terminal sequences of the transcript were determined and mapped on the DNA sequence of the supB-E region previously determined. The transcription start site is seven base pairs downstream from the Pribnow box sequence, as expected from the DNA sequence analysis and consistent with the findings on the trimeric tRNA precursor (pppG--tRNAMETM-tRNALeu-tRNAGln1) which was detected in an RNase P mutant and shown to be coded for by the supB-E region. Cleavage of the restriction fragment at the -35 region with another restriction endonuclease abolished the template activity of the fragment. Transcription of the supB-E tRNA operon was relatively unaffected by the presence of rho factor. Transcription termination occurs within a region of three bases between positions 770 and 772 from the transcription start site. Immediately upstream from the termination sites, there is a region of 26 nucleotides that could form a stem structure, thereby consistent with the general feature of rho-independent termination sites."

https://openalex.org/W1505644856,"The role of fatty acid and citrate on the interaction of the AMP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.6) reaction with glycolysis was investigated using permeabilized yeast cells. (a) Linolenate and citrate inhibited glycolytic flux and the recovery of the adenylate energy charge; however, linolenate remarkably retarded the depletion of the total adenylate pool, which was not at all affected by the addition of citrate. (b) Linolenate inhibited AMP deaminase activity in situ, resulting in the subsequent decrease in ammonium production, which reduced the activity of 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), whereas linolenate itself had no ability to inhibit the phosphofructokinase activity in the presence of excess ammonium concentration. (c) Citrate inhibited the activity of phosphofructokinase in situ in the presence and absence of ammonium ion, followed by an inhibition of glycolysis; however, AMP deaminase activity was not inhibited by citrate. The inhibition of glycolysis by fatty acids can be accounted for by the lowered activity of phosphofructokinase as a result of the decreased level of ammonium ion through the inhibition of the AMP deaminase reaction by these ligands, whereas the effect of citrate on glycolysis is a direct inhibition of phosphofructokinase without affecting the activity of AMP deaminase. Fatty acid and citrate, a principal metabolic product of fatty acid oxidation, can be responsible for the control of glycolysis in two different manners."

The nucleic acid sequences of the respective cDNAs of the two genes share considerable homology, as well as the existence of multiple forms of each gene within the genome. In this study we report on the linkage arrangement of several genes from this group. Two hPL-like genes as well as an hGH gene are shown to be linked within a 38-kilobase pair region of DNA. Linkage between a variant hGH gene and an hPL gene is also shown. The orientation and structural organization of these genes was previously established using 5'- and 3'-specific probes from a placental lactogen cDNA clone and detailed restriction endonuclease mapping. Restriction fragments from the overlapping clones were verified by comparison to digests of high molecular weight genomic DNA. In addition, the location of a specific class of repetitive DNA sequences, the Alu family, was mapped on these clones using the recombinant clone BLUR 8. All members of this multigene family have Alu repeat sequences either immediately flanking their 3' or 5' untranslated regions or within their intervening sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1527510202,"Previous observations on the effects of permeant anions on ATP-dependent calcium transport in inside-out vesicles prepared from human erythrocytes suggested that the calcium pump is electrogenic, generating a positive interior membrane potential. The present work demonstrates the development of a positive interior membrane potential across inside-out vesicle membranes during calcium transport in the absence of permeant anions. Several membrane potential probes, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate, 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide, and an electron paramagnetic resonant triphenylphosphonium derivative, provide qualitative evidence for the development of a membrane potential. Moreover, a number of parallels are observed between the changes in the membrane potential measured by the probes and calcium transport. These include enhancement by calmodulin, time course of change, similar kinetic properties, and the requirement for intact vesicle membranes. Quantitative measurements of the membrane potential shows a positive interior membrane potential of 26-37 mV using radiolabeled permeant anion distribution and 38-57 mV using 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide fluorescence changes. These membrane potentials are of a similar magnitude to those reported for the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (Zimniak, P., and Racker, E. (1978). J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4631-4637)."
https://openalex.org/W1541076689,"Glucagon was acylated at position 12 using conditions favoring reaction with the epsilon-amino group of lysine. The N epsilon-acetyl, N epsilon-hexanoyl, and N epsilon-decanoyl derivatives were prepared and purified. Secondary structure as measured by circular dichroism was lower in all derivatives than in glucagon, both in 95% methanol and in 25 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate at pH 2 and pH 12. N epsilon-Acetyl glucagon was less active than the native hormone in a radioreceptor assay and higher concentrations of this derivative were required to stimulate the adenylate cyclase activity of rat liver plasma membranes. The maximal extent of cyclase activation by this derivative was less than that found with the native hormone. N epsilon-Hexanoyl glucagon and N epsilon-decanoyl glucagon had greater activity than N epsilon-acetyl glucagon in receptor binding as well as in adenylate cyclase activation, although these two derivatives were not as active as the native hormone. N epsilon-hexanoyl glucagon and N epsilon-decanoyl glucagon were more potent in receptor binding than in adenylate cyclase activation. From these results it appears that the positive charge of the epsilon-amino groups may have a specific role in obtaining maximal biological activity, while the acyl groups contribute to the nonspecific hydrophobic interactions between the hormone and its receptor. In addition, a possible relationship between stabilization of the amphipathic helix in solution and the activity of these and other N epsilon-derivatives of glucagon is discussed."

The other splitting (approximately 2.4-3.2 MHz) is attributed to a methyl-proton on Val (E11). No coupling of protons on the proximal side is resolved. Deoxy CoHb exhibits only one prominent interaction (approximately 1.3 MHz) which is assigned to one of the protons on the proximal histidine (F8).
