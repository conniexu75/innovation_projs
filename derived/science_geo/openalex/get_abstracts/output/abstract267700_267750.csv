Nuclei prepared by this method have been compared with nuclei prepared by the method of Laskowski and with nuclei prepared by a citric acid method, particularly in regard to respiration."

https://openalex.org/W2077126327,"Fallout in the United States from early in 1951 through 1954 is summarized. Accumulated fission product activity in the United States, exclusive of the area within 200 miles of the Nevada test site, was 61 millicuries per square mile. Gamma radiation from this is of the order of 0.0010 mr/hr compared with normal background of 0.005 to 0.05 mr/hr. The measuring technique detects an increase of 10/sup -8/ roentgens per hour, natural background is 5 x 10/sup -6/ to 5 x 10/sup -5/ r/hr."

https://openalex.org/W2039161169,"The landing dynamics of and soil penetration by Surveyor I indicated that the lunar soil has a porosity in the range 0.35 to 0.45. Experiments with Surveyor III's surface sampler for soil mechanics show that the lunar soil is approximately incompressible (as the word is used in soil mechanics) and that it has an angle of internal friction of 35 to 37 degrees; these results likewise point to a porosity of 0.35 to 0.45 for the lunar soil. Combination of these porosity measurements with the already-determined radar reflectivity fixes limits to the dielectric constant of the grains of the lunar soil. The highest possible value is about 5.9, relative to vacuum; a more plausible value is near 4.3. Either figure is inconsistent with the idea that the lunar surface is covered by chondritic meteorites or other ultrabasic rocks. The data point to acid rocks, or possibly vesicular basalts; carbonaceous chondrites are not excluded."
