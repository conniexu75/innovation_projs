https://openalex.org/W2002975752,"Rats were tested for induction of maternal behavior by exposing them to young pups continuously for 10 to 15 days. Nonpregnant intact, ovariectomized. and hypophysectomized females were studied, as well as intact and castrated males. Nearly all the animals exhibited the four main items of maternal behavior and there were only minor differences in the latencies for the onset of maternal behavior among the various groups. It is concluded that all rats have a basic level of maternal responsiveness which is independent of hormonal stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2074248537,A simple calcium-selective electrode has been developed which is capable of measuring calcium ion activity in the presence of many common interfering ions. The electrode utilizes a liquid ion exchanger membrane containing the calcium salt of a disubstituted phosphoric acid.
https://openalex.org/W2011523822,"Male accessory glands were implanted in virgin females of Aedes aegypti. When exposed to males, females copulated readily but were not inseminated; they remained sterile for life. Extract from one male could sterilize more than 64 females. The active principle may be a protein or peptide. Intraspecific transplant prevented insemination in 12 species, including Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex; interspecific transplant gave partial protection."
https://openalex.org/W1974269041,"An immobilized film of an aqueous bicarbonate-carbonate solution was developed which was 4100 times more permeable to carbon dioxide than to oxygen. The carbon dioxide transport was reaction-rate limited, and thus it could be increased by addition to the film of catalysts for the hydrolysis of carbon dioxide."
https://openalex.org/W2076219728,"X-ray diffraction patterns show that the mature denticles of three extant chiton species are composed of the mineral lepidocrocite and an apatite mineral, probably francolite, in addition to magnetite. Each of the three minerals forms a discrete microarchitectural unit of the chiton denticles. This is the first indication that lepidocrocite is precipitated by marine organisms and an apatite mineral by chitons."

https://openalex.org/W2025476481,"Evoked cortical potentials and the number of flashes perceived were compared when subjects were presented with short trains of flashes under conditions where each presented flash could not be counted individually, but the train of flashes appeared to be flickering (1 to 14 flashes at 33.3 flashes per second). The rate at which each successive perceived flash was added appeared to correspond with the rate at which the successive components of the evoked response pattern were added. The temporal nature of this pattern was similar for both single flashes and trains of flashes. The results suggest that the onset of stimulation triggers a process which has a marked effect on both the cortical and perceptual response to subsequent stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2059096324,"The hydrocarbons of zooplankton pass through the digestive tract of the basking shark without fractionation or structural modification. They are resorbed in the spiral valve and deposited in the liver. In contrast to unsaturated fatty acids, the olefinic hydrocarbons are not decreased in concentration. The hydrocarbon assemblage in the digestive tract and in the liver is indicative of the food sources and feeding grounds of the shark. Squalene, abundant in shark liver, occurs only in traces in zooplankton; phytane, if present at all, constitutes less than 0.005 percent of the hydrocarbons of zooplankton and of shark liver."
https://openalex.org/W1985695929,"The human endometrium, studied with the electron microscope, undergoes asynchronous and premature cyclic development in response to intrauterine contraceptive devices. Typical nucleolar channel systems and other cellular characteristics of the normal secretory phase appear before ovulation, and decidualization occurs several days prematurely. Disturbance of the synchrony of ovular and endometrial development may be a mechanism of contraceptive action of these devices."
https://openalex.org/W2022375031,"Electron microscopical studies revealed the presence of dendritic nerve processes in sensory organs of the third- and fourth-stage juveniles of Haemonchus contortus, which contained structures resembling modified cilia. With few exceptions, the outer circle of fibers consisted of ten doublets, and in place of typical cilia-like central fibers were small microtubules or vesicles varying in number from zero to five."
https://openalex.org/W1981247871,"The rate of absorption of potassium by slices of corn leaf in the light was about twice the rate in the dark. When the light was turned on or off, changes in the rate of absorption took place some minutes after the change in illumination. Experiments with the antimetabolites, 2,4-dinitrophenol and cyanide, indicated that the source of energy for active accumulation of potassium by green tissue in the light was different from that in the dark. In the light, energy was closely linked to photosynthetic reactions; in the dark, it was linked to respiratory processes."
https://openalex.org/W2080212426,In a study of the rate of production of four species of planktonic Foraminifera in the region of the California Current it was found that their life spans are of the order of 1 month. Reproduction seems to take place mainly in the upper hundred meters. Results are in contrast to previous evidence presented in favor of yearly life cycles and maturing at great depth in other species of planktonic Foraminifera.
https://openalex.org/W2026118453,"The application of mechanical force to the sporangiophore of Phycomyces elicits a transient growth response. The immediate stimulus may be the deformation of the sporangiophore under the applied force. Compression of the cell causes an interval of faster growth, and extension causes an interval of slower growth."
https://openalex.org/W1995198635,"Antibodies to the antral hormone gastrin have been induced in the rabbit and detected by passive hemagglutination. Specificity of the antibody, as determined by three methods, is directed to gastrins I and II, gastrin pentapeptide, and gastrin tetrapeptide, as well as to the stage-1 gastrin used for immunization."
https://openalex.org/W2013835032,"Protein synthesis was studied in the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis GL after actinomycin D was added to the culture medium. When the temperature rose above that optimum for growth, there were significant reductions in protein synthesis. Lipid biosynthesis under the same conditions was slightly stimulated, an indication that the eflect was not due to an underlying reduction in energy sources. The phenomenon appears to be unique to the protein synthesizing system. Correlation with previous data suggests that it is due to nontranslational destruction of template RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2039933310,"Atmospheric ions, identified by mobility characteristics, were associated with germination of lyophilized uredospores of Puccinia striiformis West. at Bozeman Montana. Ions of intermediate size were highest in concentration, and percentage germination of spores was lowest during periods conducive to air pollution. In duplicate experiments at an isolated site near Barrow. Alaska, essentially all atmospheric ions were small ions and the fungus spores were consistently germinated near maximum."
https://openalex.org/W2080700735,"Pekin ducklings were tested with respect to their preference for approaching one of two simultaneously presented, rotating, silent duck decoys, painted in a variety of colors or patterns. Some of the ducklings had not been given any previous visual experience other than that gained in a 20-minute introduction to the empty apparatus; others had previously been given the opportunity to follow one particular decoy for 20 minutes. The decoys could be grouped into three categories: those in the first category were treated as equivalent, that is, so long as the duckling had followed one of these models it would approach either. The decoys of the second category were ones to which ""imprinting"" occurred, that is, the ducklings showed a decided preference for the model they had originally followed, whichever it was. The third category included models, one of which was always preferred, though the controls showed no such preference. The effects of the imprinting procedure vary with the stimuli presented."
https://openalex.org/W2065758458,"Like cortisol, growth hormone enhances RNA synthesis in rat liver nuclei. However, DNA-RNA hybridization experiments show that the application of growth hormone does not stimulate the formation of new species of messenger RNA. The latter phenomenon was observed after treatment with cortisol."
https://openalex.org/W2088564293,"The rate of reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol by illuminated chloroplasts isolated from ecological races of Typha latifolia was negatively correlated with length of growing season at the site of origin. Efficiency of the photochemical apparatus for this reaction was twice as high in a high-altitude population from Wyoming as in a maritime population from California."
https://openalex.org/W2161230716,"Localized changes in oxygen tension were recorded with platinum cathodes placed in the lateral geniculate nucleus in both anesthetized and awake cats. The amplitude of the responses increased with increasing stimulus intensity, but decreased with increasing flash rate. Both increases and decreases in cathode current were produced by steady illumination. The characteristics of the responses suggest that the responses reflect localized variations in blood flow, produced in turn by changes evoked in the tonic neural activity of the lateral geniculate nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2038126965,"Prototheca wickerhamii is a yeastlike organism that resembles the green alga Chlorella. Nuclear division in coordination with cytoplasmic cleavage gives rise to uninucleate cytoplasmic segments, each of which acquires a delicate cell wall and develops into an autospore. The autospores in this species are spherical; but in a variant that presumably arose as a result of spontaneous mutation, the cytoplasmic cleavage is irregular, and the resultant autospores are ovoid to bacillary. When these variant autospores grow, they swell and round up before the nuclear division begins, producing spherical cells like those seen in wild-type cultures. In view of the fact that species concept in the genus is based on size and shape of cells, the variation limits in these morphological characteristics have significant bearing on species classification."
https://openalex.org/W2089818839,"Nucleate and anucleate halves of sea urchin eggs have seven and five forms of L-malic dehydrogenase, respectively. Fertilization results in reduction of the number of enzyme forms in both halves. The normal complement of seven isozymes in unfertilized eggs appears to be a synthesis of five soluble and four particulate forms. Reduction in the number of isozymes after fertilization takes place principally in solutble forms and appears to be under cytoplasmic control."
https://openalex.org/W2092944842,"In this article I have presented, for discussion, a proposed system for energy generation by which the principal sources of environmental pollution by power plants could be eliminated. For stationary power plants the concept appears feasible technically and, according to my "" horseback estimates,"" perhaps economically as well, depending upon the economic value of the by-products of sulfur, CO(2), water, and possibly nitrogen, and upon the price we are willing to pay for a clean environment .Thus, a more thorough engineering and economic analysis to explore these and other factors in greater depth seems warranted. In the case of turbine-driven vehicles, the technical and economic feasibility of widespread distribution and handling of the fuel constitutes a serious question, but one which deserves equally serious consideration before the possibility is discounted. The reports of the cited study panels notwithstanding, the technology required for the proposed system exists today, with one exception. This exception (which is not essential for trial of the system but will be required for its complete fruition) is the development of a nuclear reactor for the prime purpose of delivering process heat for the steam reforming of natural gas and, ultimately, for gas production from coal in a continuous process, such as those discussed by Pieroni et al. (16). Today's intermittent processes of coking and gas production are both archaic and themselves large sources of atmospheric pollution, and a development program aimed at advancing the technology of the coal industry in this regard would seem long overdue. The report of the PSAC Environmental Pollution Panel recommended ""demonstration of the feasibility and economy of new developments for abating or controlling pollution through their use at Federal installations"" and suggested the coalburning TVA power plants as a likely place for such demonstration. This suggestion is doubly appropriate since the TVA is in a region of subnormal "" atmospheric ventilation"" (8). By design these plants are adjacent to the AEC's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and such a location would seem ideal for an experiment on the wedding of nuclear and fossil sources of energy. In comments on a preliminary draft of this article, proponents of ""conventional "" nuclear power pointed out that such power is hard to beat on the basis of cost, and that dissipation of heat to the air by way of cooling towers can also be accomplished in conventional plants (17). These observations are individually correct but not compatible: the low power costs cited are for very large plants [of the order of 1000 mega-watts lectrical) and larger], and the costs of cooling towers and associated equipment needed to dissipate such large amounts of heat [of the order of 2000 megawatts (thermal)] to air from a closed cycle would offset the power cost advantage of the large plant. In regard to the proposed use of nuclear process heat, Weinberg (20) has expressed doubt that much advantage can be derived from this approach because the temperatures involved are too high for low-cost reactors, and heat transfer from surfaces could involve materials problems. In the case of gas production, this is indeed an anticipated problem-not a technologically insuperable one, but a problem of reducing the cost of the materials required (16). Indeed, Weinberg himself has mentioned this possible use of nuclear heat in a recent publication discussing the steam reforming of coal to liquid fuel(21). Also, an improved process for synthesizing methane from lignitec has recently been reported (22). Since the earlier studies date back a decade, a new look at the problems and costs involved relative to the benefits to be derived (not the least of which could be new vigor for the coal industry) would seem to be in order. In the case of steam reforming of natural gas, the temperature level (about 1500 degrees F) is such that the technology is available today, and a process-heat-reactor design study could be initiated without awaiting further developments."
https://openalex.org/W2041031959,"Meat and milk products from ruminants (cows, goats, sheep, and beef animals) contribute 35 to 40 percent of the fat in the average American diet. Such fat is highly saturated, containing less than about 4 percent polyunsaturated fatty acids. The unsaturated plant lipids (fats) ordinarily consumed by the ruminant are hydrogenated (saturated) in the rumen. Transport and incorporation of this hydrogenated fat into meat and milk follows. Rumen hydrogenation does not take place until the fat is broken down to free fatty acids, thus establishing the fact that lipolysis is an essential feature of the process. Circumvention of this lipolysis may lead to more-unsaturated meat and milk fat."
https://openalex.org/W1481535933,Stuidy of the amino acid composition and amino-terminal residue in the abnormal peptide of an electrophoretically slow hemoglobin revealed that the globin's structure was alpha(2)beta(2)(121 Lys) (Obeta). This hemoglobin had been provisionally classified as Hb E or as a new heemoglobin. The clinical significance of this abnormality is not yet defined.
https://openalex.org/W1981445585,"The intensity of x-ray scattering and the radius of gyration were measured for a mixture of yeast transfer RNA's in tenth molar potassium chloride. The experimentally observed radius of gyration eliminates single-stranded, hairpin, singly folded hairpin, triple-stranded, and linked double-hairpin models of tRNA but allows certain folded cloverleaf models. The measured intensities at larger angles, beyond the radius of gyration region, lend some support to the Holley's cloverleaf model, in which three arms are folded up tightly together and the fourth arm is extended in the opposite direction."
https://openalex.org/W2003132225,"The duration of the swimming response of an intertidal amphipod to increases in hydrostatic pressure apparently serves to measure the timing of wave uprush on the beach. Experiments have demonstrated that this response to a standard pressure-increase stimulus varies in duration only slightly with temperature over the range from 10° to 28°C, with estimated Q10 values of 1.3 to 1.5. Relative insensitivity to temperature, such as here described, seems to be an essential component of biological time-measuring systems (including endogenous circadian, tidal, and lunar rhythms) that are ecologically keyed to the timing of temperature-independent environmental factors."

https://openalex.org/W1964656811,"The amounts of radioactive indole-3-acetic acid that moved, both basipetally and acropetally, through short sections of bean epicotyl were measured at 15 degrees and 25 degrees C in the presence and absence of 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid. Low temperature and this second compound each inhibited acropetal efflux of indole 3-acetic acid more than they did the influx. Results are interpreted as supporting a metabolically dependent component of the acropetal movement of auxin in bean epicotyls."
