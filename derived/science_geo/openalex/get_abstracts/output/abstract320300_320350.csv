https://openalex.org/W2062278276,"Textures of calcite crystals from a variety of mineralized tissues belonging to organisms from four phyla were examined with high-resolution synchrotron x-ray radiation. Significant differences in coherence length and angular spread were observed between taxonomic groups. Crystals from polycrystalline skeletal ensembles were more perfect than those that function as single-crystal elements. Different anisotropic effects on crystal texture were observed for sea urchin and mollusk calcite crystals, whereas none was found for the foraminifer, Patellina, and the control calcite crystals. These results show that the manipulation of crystal texture in different organisms is under biological control and that crystal textures in some tissues are adapted to function. A better understanding of this apparently widespread biological phenomenon may provide new insights for improving synthetic crystal-containing materials."
https://openalex.org/W2070186781,"Magnetosomes are intracellular, iron-rich, membrane-enclosed magnetic particles that allow magnetotactic bacteria to orient in the earth's geomagnetic field as they swim. The magnetosomes of most magnetotactic bacteria contain iron oxide particles, but some magnetotactic species contain iron sulfide particles instead. Phylogenetic analyses of small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences showed that all known magnetotactic bacteria of the iron oxide type are associated with the α subgroup of the Proteobacteria in the domain Bacteria. In contrast, uncultured magnetotactic bacteria of the iron sulfide type are specifically related to the dissimilatory sulfate-reducing bacteria within the δ subdivision of the Proteobacteria. These findings indicate a polyphyletic origin for magnetotactic bacteria and suggest that magnetotaxis based on iron oxides and iron sulfides evolved independently."
https://openalex.org/W2037267175,"The Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx has been thought to have been a feathered predator adapted to running that represented a terrestrial stage in the evolution of true birds from coelurosaurian dinosaurs. Examination of claw geometry, however, shows that (i) modern ground- and tree-dwelling birds can be distinguished on the basis of claw curvature, in that greater claw arcs characterize tree-dwellers and trunk-climbers, and (ii) the claws of the pes (hind foot) and manus (front hand) of Archaeopteryx exhibit degrees of curvature typical of perching and trunk-climbing birds, respectively. On this basis, Archaeopteryx appears to have been a perching bird, not a cursorial predator."
https://openalex.org/W2046409778,"Shewanella putrefaciens, a respiratory facultative anaerobe isolated from the Black Sea, can reduce thiosulfate, sulfite, and elemental sulfur to sulfide readily and quantitatively. This widespread and anaerobically versatile microorganism, which is incapable of reducing sulfate, uses oxidized sulfur intermediates as electron acceptors during the respiratory oxidation of organic matter. Because of its widespread distribution and abundance, it may play a significant role in sulfur and trace metal cycling in the Black Sea and in other marine and freshwater anaerobic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2057391939,"The use of high-temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides a means of investigating the structure of refractory aluminate liquids at temperatures up to 2500 K. Time-averaged structural information indicates that the average aluminum coordination for magnesium aluminate (MgAl(2)O(4)) liquid is slightly greater than for calcium aluminate (CaAl(2)O(4)) liquid and that in both liquids it is close to four. Ion dynamics simulations for these liquids suggest the presence of four-, five-, and six-coordinated aluminate species, in agreement with NMR experiments on fast-quenched glasses. These species undergo rapid chemical exchange in the high-temperature liquids, which is evidenced by a single Lorentzian NMR line."

As prepared, the films exhibit a disordered hexagonal structure; molecularly resolved images in direct space establish a connection between the extent of the positional order and the presence of defects such as dislocations. Upon heating, the films reorganize into a more condensed state with a centered rectangular crystallographic arrangement; in this new state the films exhibit long-range positional order and unusual structural features, such as a height modulation of the arachidic acid molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2011944280,"Measurements of noble gas (helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon) partitioning between silicate melt and iron melt under pressures up to 100 kilobars indicate that the partition coefficients are much less than unity and that they decrease systematically with increasing pressure. The results suggest that the Earth's core contains only negligible amounts of noble gases if core separation took place under equilibrium conditions."

Experiments in the last 10 years have led to the conclusion that the pion field is greatly suppressed at shorter distances, and that the pion is not a fundamental particle but an excitation of the vacuum."

https://openalex.org/W1981245856,"Experimenters at UCLA have succeeded in producing a plasma wave accelerator by blasting hydrogen gas with a pair of powerful laser beams to generate a plasma. The laser beams are tuned to different wavelengths, which interfere with each other and generate a pattern of light intensities that segregate the plasma's charged constituents into alternating stripes. Short but extremely strong electric fields are created between the stripes, which move through the plasma and can be used to accelerate electrons. The UCLA group succeeded in boosting the energy of electrons injected into a laboratory plasma by at least 7 MeV."
