https://openalex.org/W1563624749,"(R)-Trichostatin A (TSA) is a Streptomyces product which causes the induction of Friend cell differentiation and specific inhibition of the cell cycle of normal rat fibroblasts in the G1 and G2 phases at the very low concentrations. We found that TSA caused an accumulation of acetylated histone species in a variety of mammalian cell lines. Pulse-labeling experiments indicated that TSA markedly prolonged the in vivo half-life of the labile acetyl groups on histones in mouse mammary gland tumor cells, FM3A. The partially purified histone deacetylase from wild-type FM3A cells was effectively inhibited by TSA in a noncompetitive manner with Ki = 3.4 nM. A newly isolated mutant cell line of FM3A resistant to TSA did not show the accumulation of the acetylated histones in the presence of a higher concentration of TSA. The histone deacetylase preparation from the mutant showed decreased sensitivity to TSA (Ki = 31 nM, noncompetitive). These results clearly indicate that TSA is a potent and specific inhibitor of the histone deacetylase and that the in vivo effect of TSA on cell proliferation and differentiation can be attributed to the inhibition of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1555673341,"Phorbol esters have been reported to decrease sensitivity or responsiveness to insulin in cells in vitro. Since phorbol esters are analogues of endogenously produced 1,2-diacylglycerol, the present study investigated whether 1,2-diacylglycerol concentration is elevated in insulin-resistant tissues of the rat in vivo. Studies were done on 11-12-week-old genetically obese Zucker rats, which are insulin-resistant. Lean Zucker rats served as controls. Levels of 1,2-diacylglycerol in obese rats were increased 82% in liver, 136% in calf muscles, 72% in soleus muscle, a slow-twitch muscle, and 40% in plantaris muscle, a fast-twitch muscle. Ceramide levels in the same tissues were increased 26, 52, 69, and 13%, respectively. Studies were also done on normal, non-obese Sprague-Dawley rats 3 h, 1, 3, 8, and 15 days after interrupting the nerve supply to hindlimb muscles. We have previously shown that 3-17 days after denervation, soleus muscles are completely unresponsive to insulin and do not increase glucose uptake in response to insulin stimulation in vivo, whereas plantaris muscles show a normal glucose uptake when stimulated by insulin; however, the insulin-induced increment in glucose uptake is reduced 68% because it is superimposed on already elevated basal glucose uptake (Turinsky, J. (1987) Am. J. Physiol. 252, R531-R537). In the present study, the denervated soleus muscles exhibited a sustained increase of 23-56% in 1,2-diacylglycerol concentration between 3 h and 15 days after interruption of nerve supply. The denervated soleus muscles also showed 34 and 42% increases in ceramide concentration at 3 and 8 days after denervation, respectively. In contrast, no increases in 1,2-diacylglycerol concentration were observed in plantaris muscles at shorter intervals than 15 days after denervation. Ceramide concentrations in plantaris muscles were increased 43 and 75% at 8 and 15 days after denervation, respectively. These observations demonstrate that tissue insulin resistance is frequently associated with a long term increase in tissue 1,2-diacylglycerol concentration. This suggests the possibility that augmented 1,2-diacylglycerol levels contribute to the development of some types of tissue insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1885901959,"Dolastatin 10, a potent antimitotic peptide from a marine animal, strongly inhibits microtubule assembly, tubulin-dependent GTP hydrolysis, and the binding of vinca alkaloids to tubulin. In studies of the binding of [3H]vincristine to the protein, with vinblastine as a control for competitive inhibition (Ki, 6.6 microM), we found that the macrolide antimitotic agents maytansine and rhizoxin were also competitive inhibitors (Ki values, 3.1 and 12 microM). Dolastatin 10 and an unrelated peptide antimitotic, phomopsin A, were more potent but noncompetitive inhibitors (Ki values, 1.4 and 2.8 microM). Since maytansine and, to a much lesser extent, vinblastine interfere with nucleotide exchange on tubulin, all drugs were examined for effects on nucleotide interactions at the exchangeable GTP site. Rhizoxin had effects intermediate between those of vinblastine and maytansine. Both peptides inhibited binding of radiolabeled GTP to tubulin even more strongly than did maytansine, but no drug displaced nucleotide from tubulin. The drugs were evaluated for stabilizing effects on the colchicine binding activity of tubulin. The peptides prevented loss of this activity, and vinblastine provided partial protection, while rhizoxin and maytansine did not stabilize tubulin. A tripeptide segment of dolastatin 10 also effectively inhibits tubulin polymerization and GTP hydrolysis. The tripeptide did not significantly inhibit either vincristine binding or nucleotide exchange, nor did it stabilize colchicine binding. These findings are rationalized in terms of a model with two distinct drug binding sites in close physical proximity to each other and to the exchangeable GTP site on beta-tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W1541002222,"The debrisoquine/sparteine-type polymorphism is a clinically important inherited variation of drug metabolism characterized by two phenotypes, the extensive metabolizer and the poor metabolizer (PM). Five to 10 percent of individuals in Caucasian populations are of the PM phenotype and have deficient metabolism of debrisoquine and over 25 other drugs. Our previous studies have revealed absence of cytochrome P450IID6 protein and aberrant splicing of IID6 premRNA in livers of PMs. Moreover, two mutant alleles of the P450IID6 gene locus (CYP2D6) were identified by restriction fragment length analysis to be associated with the PM phenotype. However, the mutations of the CYP2D6 gene causing absent P450IID6 protein have not been defined. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of two types of mutant alleles of CYP2D6 isolated from genomic libraries of three PM individuals. One allele (29-A) was characterized by a single nucleotide deletion in the 5th exon with consequent frameshift and was observed in one individual only. The other type of mutant allele (29-B) was present in all three PM individuals and its sequence contained multiple mutations, notably four base changes causing amino acid changes in exons 1, 2 and 9, and a point mutation at the consensus sequence of the splice site of the 3rd intron. To understand the significance of the individual mutations, chimeric genes were constructed between the wild-type IID6 gene and the mutant 29-B allele or site-specific mutations were introduced into the IID6-cDNA and these DNA constructs were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. The mutations in exon 1 resulted in a functionally deficient IID6 protein and the mutation at the splice site in absent IID6 protein, whereas the mutations in exons 2 and 9 were of no consequence for IID6 function. Only the mutation at the splice site thus explains the absence of P450IID6 protein in livers of PM individuals and appears to be a common cause of polymorphic drug oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1494856590,"Osteogenin, an extracellular matrix component of bone, is a heparin binding differentiation factor that initiates endochondral bone formation in rats when implanted subcutaneously with an insoluble collagenous matrix. We have examined the interaction of osteogenin with various extracellular matrix components including basement membranes. Osteogenin, purified from bovine bone, binds avidly to type IV collagen and to a lesser extent to both type I and IX collagens. Osteogenin binds equally well to both native and denatured type IV collagen. Both alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains of type IV collagen are recognized by osteogenin. Osteogenin binds to a collagen IV affinity column, and is eluted by 6.0 M urea with 1 M NaCl, pH 7.4, and the eluate contained the osteogenic activity as demonstrated in vivo. Binding of osteogenin to collagen IV is not influenced by either laminin or fibronectin. These results imply that osteogenin binding to extracellular matrix components including collagens I and IV and heparin may have physiological relevance, and such interactions may modulate its local action."
https://openalex.org/W1513510460,"Endothelin, a peptide mediator produced by vascular endothelial cells, caused sustained vasoconstriction of the portal vasculature in the perfused rat liver. The vasoactive effect of endothelin was accompanied by increased glycogenolysis and alterations in hepatic oxygen consumption. The endothelin-induced increase in the portal pressure was concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 1 nM. Endothelin-induced hepatic glycogenolysis was dose-dependent but exhibited a different EC50 than for the vasoconstrictive effects of endothelin. Hepatic vasoconstriction and glycogenolysis following endothelin infusion were inhibited when Ca2+ was removed from the perfusion medium. The endothelin-induced responses in the liver were not altered by prior infusion of phenylephrine (alpha-adrenergic agonist), isoproterenol (beta-adrenergic agonist), angiotensin II, glucagon, platelet-activating factor, or the platelet-activating factor antagonist, BN52021. However, repeated infusion of endothelin resulted in desensitization of the glycogenolytic response but was without a significant effect on hepatic vasoconstriction. Endothelin also stimulated metabolism of inositol phospholipids in isolated hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in primary culture. The present experiments demonstrate, for the first time, that endothelin is a very potent agonist in the liver eliciting both a sustained vasoconstriction of the hepatic vasculature and a significant increase in hepatic glucose output."
https://openalex.org/W1563567604,"The functional characterization of human platelet-released factor V and its activation by factor Xa and thrombin was studied by functional assessment of cofactor activity and Western blotting analyses of platelet releasates, obtained by stimulating washed suspensions of platelets with various agonists, including collagen, collagen with ADP, and the calcium ionophore A23187. Platelet factor V was released as a partially proteolyzed molecule that was bound to platelet microparticles, irrespective of the agonist used. Radiolabeled plasma factor V was not cleaved for up to 30 min following release when added to platelets prior to stimulation, suggesting that platelet factor V was stored in a partially proteolyzed form. Released platelet factor V possessed significant cofactor activity that was increased only 2-3-fold by either factor Xa or thrombin. The factor V subunits that expressed cofactor activity were isolated and found to consist of peptides of Mr = 220,000 and 150,000. Incubation of released platelet factor V with factor Xa or thrombin yielded the same cleavage pattern, in which two peptides of Mr = 105,000 and 74,000 appeared to be electrophoretically indistinguishable from thrombin-activated plasma factor V. Under the conditions of these studies, factor Xa activated platelet-released factor V 50-100 times more effectively than thrombin. This observation may be due in part to the existence of platelet factor V in a partially proteolyzed state, or its association with platelet microparticles following platelet stimulation. These data collectively suggest that platelet-released factor V may be the foremost initiator of prothrombinase complex assembly and function during the early stages of coagulation with additional cofactor activation accomplished by factor Xa."
https://openalex.org/W1621137138,"The purification of two heparitinases and a heparinase, in high yields from Flavobacterium heparinum was achieved by a combination of molecular sieving and cation-exchange chromatography. Heparinase acts upon N-sulfated glucosaminido-L-iduronic acid linkages of heparin. Substitution of N-sulfate by N-acetyl groups renders the heparin molecule resistant to degradation by the enzyme. Heparitinase I acts on N-acetylated or N-sulfated glucosaminido-glucuronic acid linkages of the heparan sulfate. Sulfate groups at the 6-position of the glucosamine moiety of the heparan sulfate chains seem to be impeditive for heparitinase I action. Heparitinase II acts upon heparan sulfate producing disulfated, N-sulfated and N-acetylated-6-sulfated disaccharides, and small amounts of N-acetylated disaccharide. These and other results suggest that heparitinase II acts preferentially upon N,6-sulfated glucosaminido-glucuronic acid linkages. The total degradation of heparan sulfate is only achieved by the combined action of both heparitinases. The 13C NMR spectra of the disaccharides formed from heparan sulfate and a heparin oligosaccharide formed by the action of the heparitinases are in accordance to the proposed mode of action of the enzymes. Comparative studies of the enzymes with the commercially available heparinase and heparitinase are described."
https://openalex.org/W1540843979,"In the absence of delta mu H+, the in vitro translocation of proOmpA resulted in the stable accumulation of a possible translocation intermediate in addition to a transiently accumulating one. The stable intermediate was detected on a polyacrylamide gel as two proteinase K-resistant bands corresponding to a molecular weight of about 28,000. The appearance of the bands was appreciably enhanced when proOmpA was oxidized with ferricyanide. No mature OmpA appeared. When proOmpA reduced with dithiothreitol was used, on the other hand, the bands did not appear at all. Upon the replacement of Cys302 of OmpA with Gly, the intermediate accumulation was abolished. The proOmpA treated with dithiothreitol was labeled with N-[3H]-ethylmaleimide, whereas that treated with ferricyanide was not. The ferricyanide-treated proOmpA was translocated into membrane vesicles in the presence of delta mu H+. The mature OmpA thus translocated and processed was not labeled with N-[3H]ethylmaleimide. It is concluded that proOmpA possessing the Cys290-Cys302 disulfide bridge can be translocated without cleavage of the bridge, when delta mu H+ is imposed. The accumulation of the disulfide bridge-containing intermediate was ATP-dependent, whereas its conversion to the translocated mature form was not blocked in the presence of adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate. It is concluded that the early and late stages of the translocation reaction require ATP and delta mu H+ differently."
https://openalex.org/W1581561389,"The secretion signal of extracellular metalloprotease B that is secreted without a signal peptide by the Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi is shown by deletion and gene fusion analyses to be located within the last 40 C-terminal amino acids. Secretion of a peptide containing only this region of the protease requires the same three secretion factors (PrtD, PrtE, and PrtF) that were previously shown to be required for the secretion of the full-length protease. This secretion signal can also be recognized, albeit inefficiently, by the analogous secretion machinery of alpha-hemolysin, another protein with a C-terminal secretion signal that is secreted by some strains of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. The secretion signal was fused to an internal 200-amino acid fragment from the sequence of the cytoplasmic protein amylomaltase to promote its specific secretion by the protease secretion pathway. Almost exactly the same sequence as that identified as the protease B secretion signal was also found at the C terminus of metalloprotease C that is also secreted by E. chrysanthemi."
https://openalex.org/W1511429670,"A mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 defective in 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase has been isolated. At the permissive temperature for growth, 30 degrees C, 20% of the total cellular glycerophospholipids is 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, as identified by mass spectral analysis and proton NMR. This percentage of 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate rises to about 30% when the temperature of the culture is shifted to 42 degrees C. This increase is primarily at the expense of phosphatidylethanolamine. Extracts from cells harboring the plsC mutation have no detectable 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity. The fatty acid composition of the accumulated 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate is about 60% cis-vaccenate and 40% palmitate, with no detectable amounts of palmitoleate or other fatty acids, consistent with the known fatty acid composition of the sn-1 position of glycerophospholipids. The isolation of this gene, plsC, completes the list of genes known to be required for the synthesis of the major glycerophospholipids in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1569845119,"High level expression of TEM beta-lactamase results in the accumulation of precursor and mature protein in the insoluble fraction of Escherichia coli. The mature polypeptide is sequestered in protein aggregates (inclusion bodies) located within the periplasmic space whereas the insoluble precursor is present in the cytoplasm. With the native beta-lactamase, aggregation is observed when the rate of expression exceeds 2.5% of the total protein synthesis rate. Substitution of the native signal sequence with the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) leader peptide results in extensive aggregation of only the mature protein. Furthermore, for OmpA-beta-lactamase, the accumulation of mature insoluble protein is independent of the rate of protein synthesis. These observations cannot be accounted by the kinetics of export of the OmpA-beta-lactamase and the native precursor, therefore suggesting that the signal sequence affects the conformation of the newly secreted mature polypeptide and in turn, the folding pathway. Previously, we have shown that the aggregation of the mature protein secreted using its own signal sequence can be inhibited by growing the cells in the presence of non-metabolizable sugars such as sucrose (Bowden, G., and Georgiou, G. (1988) Biotechnol. Prog. 4, 97-101). We show here that this phenomenon is not related to osmotic effects, changes in beta-lactamase translation or precursor processing. It follows that the addition of sugars exerts a direct effect on the in vivo pathway of aggregation and folding, in analogy with the well characterized effect of sugars in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1551842960,"Previous studies have shown that extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI) is an effective inhibitor of factor Xa alone or factor VIIa-tissue factor complex in the presence of factor Xa. Since tissue factor exposure is implicated in thrombogenesis, we hypothesized that EPI may be valuable in the treatment of some thromboembolic episodes. Furthermore, EPI may be an important factor in bleeding complications in hemophiliacs. In the present study, human EPI was expressed in baby hamster kidney cells using a mammalian expression vector. Transfected cells expressed 1-2 micrograms/ml of recombinant EPI (rEPI) which was purified to homogeneity by heparin-Sepharose chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Purified rEPI exhibited a specific activity of 30,000 units/mg and migrated as a single band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular weight of 42,000. In addition, the NH2-terminal sequence of rEPI was identical to that of HepG2 EPI and HeLa EPI. The ability of rEPI to inhibit factor X activation by a complex of factor VIIa-tissue factor was then examined in the presence and absence of plasma concentrations of human factors VIII and IX. Using relipidated human brain tissue factor apoprotein, rEPI inhibited the factor VIIa-mediated activation of factor X half-maximally at 2.5 and 1 nM in the presence and absence of factors VIII and IX, respectively. Using monolayers of a human bladder carcinoma cell line (J82) as the source of tissue factor, the activation of factor X by cell-bound factor VIIa was inhibited half-maximally by 5 nM rEPI in the presence of factors VIII and IX. The proteolytic activity of J82 cell-bound factor Xa toward prothrombin was inhibited half-maximally at approximately 5 nM rEPI, while the amidolytic activity of factor Xa in solution was inhibited by rEPI with a Ki of 130 pM. Recombinant EPI also inhibited the amidolytic activity of factor VIIa half-maximally at 10 nM rEPI in the presence of relipidated tissue factor apoprotein and calcium. These results indicate that, in the presence of plasma concentrations of factors VIII and IX, at least 10 times the plasma concentration of EPI is required to reduce factor VIIa-dependent factor X activation one order of magnitude in vitro. In the absence of functional factor VIII and IX, rEPI at plasma levels was a potent inhibitor of factor VIIa-mediated factor X activation, and this activity presumably accounts for the inability of hemophiliacs to initiate hemostasis via the extrinsic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1526510974,"Rapid activation of phospholipase D (PLD) in response to cell stimulation was recently demonstrated in many systems, raising the hypothesis that PLD participates in transduction of extracellular signals across the plasma membrane. In the present study, we describe the identification of a neutral PLD activity in purified rat brain synaptic plasma membranes, and the in vitro conditions required to assay its catalytic activity with exogenous [3H]phosphatidylcholine as substrate. Production of [3H]phosphatidic acid, the natural lipid product of PLD and of [3H]phosphatidylethanol, catalyzed by PLD in the presence of ethanol via transphosphatidylation, were measured. The synaptic membrane PLD exhibited its highest activity at pH 7.2 and was thus defined as a neutral PLD. Enzyme activity was absolutely dependent on the presence of sodium oleate and was strongly activated by Mg2+ ions (at 1 mM). Ca2+ at concentrations up to 0.25 mM was as stimulatory as Mg2+, but at 2 mM it completely inhibited enzyme activity. Mg2+ extended the linear phase of PLD activity from 2 to 15 min, suggesting that it may stabilize the enzyme under our assay conditions. The production of [3H]phosphatidylethanol was a saturable function of ethanol concentration. Production of [3H] phosphatidic acid was inversely related to the concentration of ethanol and to the accumulation of phosphatidylethanol, indicating that the two phospholipids are indeed produced by the competing hydrolase and transferase activities of the same enzyme. beta,beta-Dimethylglutaric acid, utilized previously as a buffer in studies of rat brain PLD, inhibited enzyme activity at neutral pH but not at acidic pH. The properties of the neutral synaptic membrane PLD and its relationships with other in vitro, acid, and neutral PLD activities, as well as with the signal-dependent PLD detected in intact cells, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W174714445,"In this study, we have used isolated pancreatic islets cultured for 7 days in 3 or 30 mM glucose to explore whether glucokinase is induced or activated by high glucose concentrations and has related enzyme activity to glucose-stimulated insulin release. Islets cultured in low glucose medium or low glucose medium plus 350 ng/ml insulin did not respond to high glucose stimulation. Islets cultured in medium containing high glucose concentrations showed a high rate of basal insulin secretion when perifused with 5 mM glucose, and the insulin release was greatly augmented in a biphasic secretion profile when the glucose concentration was raised to 16 mM. Islet glucokinase and hexokinase activities were determined by a sensitive and specific fluorometric method. Glucokinase activity was reduced to approximately 50% in islets cultured in low glucose medium with or without insulin present compared to results with fresh islets. However, islets cultured in 30 mM glucose showed that glucokinase activity was elevated to 236% compared to results with fresh islets. It is concluded that (a) glucose is the physiological regulator of glucokinase in the islet of Langerhans and that (b) the activity of glucokinase plays a crucial role in glucose-induced insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1508483515,"A DNA-binding factor present in a wide variety of cell types is shown to bind to a site (GHF2) within the rat growth hormone gene promoter between nucleotides -147 and -129. Biochemical and transcriptional properties identify this factor as Sp1. The degree of glycosylation of one of the forms of Sp1 is observed to vary in a cell type-specific fashion. The GHF2 binding site overlaps with the more distal (dGHF1) of the two binding sites for the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1. DNase I footprinting and gel retardation analysis with partially purified Sp1 and Pit-1 show that Sp1 and Pit-1 binding to these sites is mutually exclusive. Despite the inability of these two transcription factors to be simultaneously bound to their overlapping sites in vitro, the structural integrity of both binding sites appears essential to the maximal expression of the rat growth hormone promoter after transfection into pituitary GC cells. These findings suggest that activation of the rat growth hormone promoter by Sp1 and Pit-1 may occur through a multistage mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1496425492,"Abstract The alpha-sarcin domain of 28 S RNA in Xenopus oocytes is attacked by several catalytic toxins (e.g. alpha-sarcin and ricin) that abolish protein synthesis. We synthesized 6 ribozymes targeted to the alpha-sarcin domain and to an oligoribonucleotide (34-mer) that mimics this domain. Sarcin ribozyme 5 (SR5) efficiently cleaved after the CUC site in the synthetic 34-mer in vitro at 50 degrees C. SR5 also cut the same site when both substrate and ribozyme were coinjected or injected separately into oocytes at 18 degrees C. Correct cleavage in vivo was shown by isolating and sequencing the large cleavage fragment. The cleavage reaction appeared to function equally well in the oocyte nucleus and cytoplasm. SR5 also correctly cleaved endogenous 28 S RNA in oocytes, although cutting was much less efficient than with alpha-sarcin. We therefore demonstrated that a ribozyme specifically cuts both a model substrate and a cellular RNA in vivo. Earlier work showed that certain injected deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to the alpha-sarcin region abolish protein synthesis. Oocyte protein synthesis was also abolished by an SR5 containing a single G----U substitution that inactivates RNA catalysis, indicating that SR5's translational suppression was perhaps due to antisense function rather than ribozyme cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1523357361,"Chemical modification and site-specific mutagenesis approaches were used in this study to identify the active site serine residue of pancreatic cholesterol esterase. In the first approach, purified porcine pancreatic cholesterol esterase was covalently modified by incubation with [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). The radiolabeled cholesterol esterase was digested with CNBr, and the peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography. A single 3H-containing peptide was obtained for sequence determination. The results revealed the binding of DFP to a serine residue within the serine esterase homologous domain of the protein. Furthermore, the DFP-labeled serine was shown to correspond to serine residue 194 of rat cholesterol esterase (Kissel, J. A., Fontaine, R. N., Turck, C. W., Brockman, H. L., and Hui, D. Y. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1006, 227-236). The codon for serine 194 in rat cholesterol esterase cDNA was then mutagenized to ACT or GCT to yield mutagenized cholesterol esterase with either threonine or alanine, instead of serine, at position 194. Expression of the mutagenized cDNA in COS-1 cells demonstrated that substitution of serine 194 with threonine or alanine abolished enzyme activity in hydrolyzing the water-soluble substrate, p-nitrophenyl butyrate, and the lipid substrates cholesteryl [14C]oleate and [14C] lysophosphatidylcholine. These studies definitively identified serine 194 in the catalytic site of pancreatic cholesterol esterase."
https://openalex.org/W1536499613,"Abstract The role of Asp-212 in the proton pumping mechanism of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) has been studied by a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy. Difference spectra were recorded at low temperature for the bR----K and bR----M photoreactions of the mutants Asp-212----Glu, Asp-212----Asn, and Asp-212----Ala. Despite an increased proportion of the 13-cis form of bR (normally associated with dark adaptation), all of the mutants exhibited a light-adapted form containing as a principal component the normal all-trans retinal chromophore. The absence of a shift in the retinal C = C stretching frequency in these mutants indicates that Asp-212 is not a major determinant of the visible absorption wavelength maximum in light-adapted bR. It is unlikely that Asp-212 is the acceptor group for the Schiff base proton since both the Asp-212----Glu and Asp-212----Ala mutants formed an M intermediate. All of the Asp-212 mutants were missing a Fourier transform infrared difference band that had been assigned previously to protonation changes of Tyr-185. These results are discussed in terms of a model in which Tyr-185 and Asp-212 form a polarizable hydrogen bond and are positioned near the C13-Schiff base portion of the chromophore. These 2 residues may be involved in stabilizing the relative orientation of the F and G helices and isomerizing the retinal in a regioselective manner about the C13 = C14 double bond."
https://openalex.org/W1484847336,"The pepsin-like aspartyl proteases consist of a single polypeptide chain with topologically similar amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, each of which contributes 1 aspartic acid residue to the active site. This structure has been proposed to have evolved by gene duplication and fusion from a dimeric enzyme composed of two identical polypeptide chains, such as the aspartyl protease (PRT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). To determine if a single polypeptide form of the HIV-1 protease would be enzymatically active, two protease coding regions were linked to form a dimeric gene (pFGGP). Expression of this gene in Escherichia coli yielded a protein with the expected molecular mass of 22 kDa. The in vitro kinetic parameters of PRT and FGGP (where FGGP is the single polypeptide form of the HIV-1 protease with 2 glycine residues connecting the two subunits) for three peptide substrates are similar. Construction and analysis of a CheY-GAG-FGGP fusion protein demonstrated that FGGP is capable of precursor processing in vivo. Mutation of one or both of the active site aspartates to either asparagine or glutamate rendered the enzyme inactive, demonstrating that both active site aspartate residues are required for enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1527202545,"A recent study reported that protein synthesis was inhibited in rat livers perfused with medium containing vasopressin (Chin, K. -V., Cade, C., Brostrom, M. A., and Brostrom, C. O. (1988) Int. J. Biochem. 20, 1313-1319). The inhibition of protein synthesis caused by vasopressin was associated with a disaggregation of polysomes, suggesting that peptide chain initiation was slowed relative to elongation. In contrast, Redpath and Proud (Redpath, N. T., and Proud, C. G. (1989) Biochem. J. 262, 69-75) recently reported an inhibition of peptide chain elongation by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent mechanism. Therefore, the question remained whether only peptide chain initiation was inhibited or both initiation and elongation were affected by vasopressin. In the present study, vasopressin was found to inhibit protein synthesis in both perfused rat livers and isolated rat hepatocytes. Ribosomal half-transit times in isolated hepatocytes averaged 1.9 +/- 0.1 min with or without vasopressin present in the media, demonstrating that the rate of peptide chain elongation was unaffected by vasopressin. Instead, the inhibition of protein synthesis induced by vasopressin was manifested at the level of peptide chain initiation. Vasopressin treatment resulted in both a 2-fold increase in the number of free ribosomal particles and a greater than 50% decrease in the amount of [35S]methionine bound to 43 S preinitiation complexes. In addition, the activity of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2B in crude extracts from perfused livers was reduced to 53% of the control value in response to vasopressin. The inhibition of eIF-2B activity was associated with an increase in the proportion of the alpha-subunit of eIF-2 in the phosphorylated form from 9.6% in control livers to 30.7% in livers perfused with medium containing vasopressin. The results demonstrate the novel finding that the inhibition of protein synthesis in vasopressin-treated livers is caused by a reduction in eIF-2B activity due to an increase in phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1602609341,"The effects of lowered O2 tension on insulin secretion and changes in cellular energy parameters were investigated in isolated rat pancreatic islets perifused with buffers equilibrated with 21, 9, 5, and 1% oxygen and containing 5 mM glucose. Decreasing the external [O2] reduced the amount of insulin released in response to 16 mM glucose, 20 mM alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, and 40 mM KCl. Secretion elicited by high glucose or KCl had declined significantly at 9% oxygen, whereas that caused by alpha-ketoisocaproic acid became inhibited below 5% O2. Lowering the oxygen tension also decreased the ability of islets to respond with a rise in [ATP]/[ADP] upon stimulation with metabolic secretagogues. This reduction in the evoked increase in the nucleotide ratios paralleled the inhibition of stimulated insulin secretion. Addition of 2 mM amytal markedly decreased the islet energy level and eliminated the secretory response to 16 mM glucose. The results suggest that enhancement of B-cell energy production and a consequent rise in [ATP] (or [ATP]/[ADP]) are a necessary event for the hormone release elicited by high glucose and alpha-ketoisocaproic acid. A decrease in temperature inhibited insulin secretion with all three secretagogues tested. The energies of activation were similar for high glucose and KCl-induced secretion, about 20 kcal/mol, but were higher for alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, about 35 kcal/mol. At 28 degrees C, the [ATP]/[ADP] was larger than that at 38 degrees C (8 versus 5) and was not increased further upon addition of 16 mM glucose. It is suggested that a decrease in the rate of energy production at lowered temperatures may contribute to the inhibition of insulin release caused by metabolic secretagogues."
https://openalex.org/W1583392323,"The incorporation of iodide into proteins (PBI) and lipids (LBI) of horse thyroid slices was measured in various conditions. Their dependency on the concentration of extracellular iodide was strikingly different. For PBI the relationship was biphasic with a decrease above 10 microM, likely to correspond to the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. On the contrary, LBI increased as a function of iodide concentration up to 100 microM. Methimazole (MMI) inhibited the incorporation of iodide into both LBI and PBI, but higher concentrations of MMI were required to depress LBI as compared to PBI. The inhibition of active iodide transport by NaCIO4 reduced both PBI and LBI. Chromatography on silica gel resolved almost equal amounts of low and high polarity iodolipids. The main unpolar iodolipid was identified as 2-iodohexadecanal (2-IHDA), on the basis of proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and co-elution with authentic 2-IHDA obtained by chemical synthesis in reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography. The presence of 2-IHDA was also detected in dog thyroid slices, following incubation with KI (50 microM) and in the rat thyroid, 4 hours after intraperitoneal injection of KI (650 micrograms). An incubation of bovine brain plasmalogens with lactoperoxidase, iodide, and H2O2 generated 2-IHDA. In conclusion, we have identified a major thyroid iodolipid as 2-iodohexadecanal. The biosynthesis of this compound is likely to involve the addition of iodine to the vinyl ether group of plasmalogens."
https://openalex.org/W1556562622,"Activation of protein kinase C in T cells results in rapid phosphorylation of a 19-kDa intracellular protein termed 19K. We report the purification of 19K from human peripheral T cells and an internal 20-amino acid sequence determined from this protein. It is shown that 19K is a novel cytoplasmatic protein which is phosphorylated in vitro by partially purified protein kinase C. 19K-specific antibodies, raised by immunizing rabbits with purified protein, were used to show that the 19K is expressed, and phosphorylated in response to protein kinase C activation, in several cellular systems. These antibodies were also used to precipitate 19K from both [35S]methionine and 32Pi-labeled T cells. The data showed that 15 min of phorbol ester treatment has no effect on the rate of 19K synthesis but results in induction of 19K phosphorylation. However, we demonstrate, by Western blot analysis, that expression of 19K in primary peripheral T cells increased at least 10-fold over a period of 4 days after activation. The increase in 19K expression correlates with initiation of DNA synthesis, and in proliferating T cells 19K comprises approximately 0.2% of total cytoplasmatic protein. Thus, 19K is a novel putative protein kinase C substrate which is subject to activation associated up-regulation in human T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1498183858,"Abstract An enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of certain 4-alkyl-o-benzoquinones to 2-hydroxy-p-quinone methides has been purified to apparent homogeneity from the hemolymph of Sarcophaga bullata by employing conventional protein purification techniques. The purified enzyme migrated with an approximate molecular weight of 98,000 on gel filtration chromatography. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 46,000, indicating that it is made up of two identical subunits. It exhibited a pH optimum of 6.0 and readily converted chemically synthesized as well as enzymatically generated quinones derived from N-acetyldopamine, N-beta-alanyldopamine, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl alcohol to highly unstable 2-hydroxy-p-quinone methides. The quinone methides thus formed were rapidly and nonenzymatically hydrated to form side chain hydroxylated o-diphenols as the stable product. In support of this proposition, when the enzyme reaction with N-acetyldopamine quinone was conducted in the presence of 10% methanol, racemic beta-methoxy-N-acetyldopamine was recovered as an additional product. The quinones of N-acetylnorepinephrine, N-beta-alanylnorepinephrine, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol were also attacked by the isomerase, resulting in the formation of N-acetylarterenone, N-beta-alanylarterenone and 2-hydroxy-3',4'-dihydroxyacetophenone, respectively as the stable products. The isomerase converted the dihydrocaffeiyl methyl amide quinone to its quinone methide analog which rapidly tautomerized to yield caffeiyl methyl amide. The importance of quinone isomerase in insect immunity and sclerotization of insect cuticle is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1557376956,"The transport of [125I]triiodothyronine ([125I]T3) and [3H]tryptophan ([3H]Trp) by washed rat erythrocytes was studied at 25 degrees C in the presence of leucine in order to block the neutral amino acid transport system L. Eadie-Hofstee plots of initial velocity data gave the following values of Km (micromolar) and Vmax (nanomole/min/10(8) cells): 0.122 +/- 0.007 and 0.140 +/- 0.021 for T3, and 558 +/- 28 and 17.4 +/- 2.3 for Trp (n = 5). The Trp transport system in rat erythrocytes is similar to the human erythrocyte aromatic amino acid-specific system T described by Rosenberg et al. (Rosenberg, R., Young, J. D., and Ellory, J. C. (1980) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 598, 375-384). Unlabeled aromatic amino acids (e.g. Trp, phenylalanine, tyrosine) competitively inhibited [125I]T3 uptake and unlabeled iodothyronine analogues (e.g. T3, D-T3, thyroxine, thyronine) competitively inhibited [3H]Trp uptake. The inhibition constants of these competitors measured with each labeled substrate were highly correlated. N-Ethylmaleimide irreversibly inhibited T3 and Trp transport and each substrate protected the transport system of the other from inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide. The Vmax of T3 and Trp transport by human erythrocytes were 500 and 120 times lower, respectively, than those of rat erythrocytes (0.30 and 126 pmol/min/10(8) cells, respectively). The T3 and Trp transport activities of sheep erythrocytes were undetectable. These results indicate that T3 and Trp either share a common multi-specific transport system or are transported by closely linked systems which interact in the erythrocyte membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2123201636,"High-affinity binding of thyroid hormone (T3) to nuclear receptors influences the transcriptional rate of specific genes. The carboxylic acid, sodium butyrate, is known to reduce nuclear binding of T3 in GH3 rat pituitary cels, and this effect correlates with inhibition of T3 responsiveness. Incubation of GH3 cells with 10 mM, but not 1 mM, sodium butyrate abolishes induction of growth hormone gene expression by T3. The relationship between thyroid hormone receptor (TR) depletion and inhibition of T3 action was further investigated by determining the effects of sodium butyrate on TR gene expression. GH3 cells contain mRNAs encoding at least three thyroid hormone receptors (TRs alpha 1, beta 1, and beta 2), as well as a related non-T3 binding repressor or T3 action (c-erbA alpha 2). Remarkably, 10 mM sodium butyrate reduces TR beta 2 mRNA levels by greater than 95% in the presence or absence of T3. The down-regulation of TR beta 2 mRNA occurs at a concentration of sodium butyrate between 5 and 10 mM and is maximal by 8 h of treatment. In contrast, TR beta 1 mRNA levels are unchanged. Furthermore, sodium butyrate has little effect on the mRNAs encoding TR alpha 1 and c-erbA alpha 2. Nuclear run-on assays indicated that sodium butyrate depletes TR beta 2 mRNA by rapidly repressing TR beta 2 gene transcription. In the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D, the half-life of TR beta 2 mRNA was approximately 3 h in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate. Thus, the reduction in TR number induced by sodium butyrate is likely to be due to the transcriptionally mediated reduction in TR beta 2 mRNA. These data suggest that TR beta 2 has an important physiological role in the regulation of growth hormone gene expression by T3."
https://openalex.org/W1488094059,"Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase activity is absolutely dependent on the presence of a divalent cation in the reaction mixture. This requirement can be satisfied by either Mg2+, Co2+, or Mn2+. When Mg2+ is used, the reaction rate is inhibited by metal ligands, and this inhibition can be reversed by Zn2+. Reaction rates in Mg2+ are also stimulated by the addition of micromolar amounts of Zn2+. To examine the role of Zn2+ in terminal transferase catalysis we analyzed for Zn2+ in homogeneous recombinant human terminal transferase preparations and found that Zn2+ is not an intrinsic part of enzyme molecule. Analysis of Zn2+ binding to terminal transferase under equilibrium conditions shows about 0.3 g of atom of Zn2+/mol of enzyme, suggesting that Zn2+ forms an easily dissociable complex with the enzyme molecule. Kinetic analyses showed that the stimulatory effect of Zn2+ is observed in several buffer systems. Zn2+ increases the affinity of the enzyme for the initiator about 2-fold and decreases affinity for dATP more than 10-fold, resulting in an increase in the apparent Vmax of the reaction. Using a 3'-ended 2',3'-dideoxyoligonucleotide as an inhibitor demonstrates that the inhibitor has no effect on the reaction rate in the absence of Zn2+ but is competitive with respect to the initiator in the presence of Zn2+. These results suggest that Zn2+ is a positive effector for terminal transferase, interacting with oligonucleotide and enzyme near the initiator binding site. Binding of Zn2+ to the enzyme appears to induce conformational changes that greatly increase the Vmax of the reaction with a concomitant decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for dNTP."
https://openalex.org/W1488152157,"Four forms of dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), which catalyzes the first reaction in the lysine-specific biosynthetic pathway in higher plants, were purified to homogeneity from a suspension culture of wheat (Triticum aestivum). These polypeptides have similar N-terminal amino acid sequences. Two different cDNA clones were isolated by screening a wheat cDNA library with oligonucleotide probes based on these amino acid sequences. The predicted amino acid sequences indicate that both clones encode putative chloroplast transit peptides that have little homology to each other as well as the conserved mature protein portions of Mr 35,737 and 35,776 (94% identity). Mature wheat DHDPS has 30% amino acid identity to Escherichia coli DHDPS. One of the cloned cDNAs, which had been fused to bacterial transcription/translation signals, genetically complemented a strain of E. coli that lacks endogenous DHDPS activity. Moreover, the expression of wheat DHDPS cDNA in wild-type E. coli increased the enzymatic activity 10-fold in the transformed bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1487848365,"The photocycle kinetics of the bacteriorhodopsin mutant Tyr-185----Phe has been investigated by UV-visible transient spectroscopy. Flash-induced spectral changes were measured from 100 ns to 500 ms using a gated optical multichannel analyzer on protein samples that were reconstituted in vesicles with Halobacterium halobium lipids. Tyr-185----Phe exhibits a pH-dependent absorbance spectrum reflecting contributions from two different species. At pH 6, the dominant photocycling species has a lambda max near 610 nm although the absorption maximum of light-adapted Tyr-185----Phe is at 581 nm. This red-shifted species does not form any M-like intermediate and undergoes a photocycle similar to that observed for deionized blue membrane. At pH 8, the dominant photoactive form exhibits a lambda max near 550 nm. This purple species, which is blue shifted 20 nm relative to wild-type bacteriorhodopsin, exhibits a photocycle similar to the wild type. However, M formation occurs in 8 microseconds, approximately three times faster than wild-type bacteriorhodopsin at pH 8. In addition, an unusually long lived intermediate absorbing at 610 nm is observed at high pH. In the UV region, a broad band near 300-310 nm is absent in the mutant relative to wild type, consistent with earlier measurements made at low temperature which suggest that Tyr-185 undergoes a change in protonation. Steady-state proton pumping action spectra indicate that the 550 nm species does transport protons but that the blue species is inactive. These results are discussed in terms of a model that hypothesizes that Tyr-185 is located close to the bacteriorhodopsin chromophore and stabilizes the interaction of helices F and G through formation of a polarizable bond with Asp-212."
https://openalex.org/W2440996384,"Low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) is a membrane glycoprotein carrying both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides, processing of which is reflected in conversion from a precursor to mature form during its synthesis and intracellular transport. Treatment with brefeldin A (BFA) of mouse macrophage-like J774 cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and two human cancer cell lines (A431 and IMC-2) resulted in production of LDL-R with a molecular size 5-10 kDa smaller than that of the mature form in the control cells. Treatment with sialidase caused apparent reduction in the molecular size of LDL-R synthesized in all BFA-treated J774, Chinese hamster ovary, A431, and IMC-2 cell lines as observed for the mature form of the control cells. Thus, O-linked sugar chains of LDL-R were apparently sialylated in the BFA-treated cells. We also examined the effect of BFA on the processing of another membranous glycoprotein, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) carrying only N-linked oligosaccharides. EGF-R synthesized in the presence of BFA was found to have no response to sialidase treatment, suggesting that the drug blocks the sialylation of EGF-R. The results indicate that BFA causes different effects on the sialylation of LDL-R and EGF-R depending upon linkage types of their oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1496926654,"To probe the role of nucleotide cofactor in the binding of single-stranded DNA to recA protein, we have developed a sedimentation assay using 5'-labeled 32P-poly(dT).recA.poly(dT) complexes sediment quantitatively when centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 45 min, whereas free poly(dT) remains in the supernatant. In the presence of ATP, between 6 and 7 bases cosediment per recA monomer; but when ADP is present or in the absence of added nucleotide cofactor, only 3-3.5 bases/recA monomer cosediment. In competition experiments in which recA.32P-poly(dT) complexes are incubated with unlabeled poly(dT), we again find 3-3.5 bases of labeled poly(dT) cosedimenting per recA monomer when no nucleotide cofactor is present. However, when the same experiment is performed with ATP, only half of the expected 6-7 bases of labeled poly(dT) remain bound to the DNA, demonstrating that half of the poly(dT) in the complex exchanges rapidly with free poly(dT), whereas the other half equilibrates slowly, like poly(dT) in the absence of nucleotide. The rate of exchange of the second more tightly bound poly(dT) is accelerated when ADP is present. Our observations are rationalized by a model in which each recA protein helical filament binds two strands of poly(dT) with a stoichiometry of 3-3.5 bases/recA monomer/strand."
https://openalex.org/W1531938682,"Abstract The LEU3 protein of yeast activates a number of genes in the branched chained amino acid pathways. Native LEU3 is modulated by alpha-isopropylmalate, an intermediate in leucine biosynthesis. alpha-Isopropylmalate is needed for transcriptional activation, but not for DNA binding. We show here that the transcriptional activation function of LEU3 resides within the C-terminal 32 amino acids. An adjacent stretch of 81 residues is dispensable and apparently forms a connecting link between the activation domain and a large central region previously identified as important for modulation. The newly defined activation domain contains a cluster of three tryptophan residues, each of which was changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Surprisingly, all three Trp----Ala mutations affect modulation. One of them, Trp-864----Ala, creates a LEU3 molecule that is largely unmodulated and also is a better transcriptional activator than is wild type LEU3 (hyperactivator). The other two mutations (Trp-861----Ala and Trp-870----Ala) change the modulation ratio but have no effect on the maximal activation efficiency of the activator. We propose that the activation domain of LEU3 is kept silent by association with the central region of the protein and that an alpha-isopropylmalate-induced conformational change in the central region releases and thus activates the activation domain."
https://openalex.org/W1529277280,"The nucleotide sugar precursor of the oleandrose units of the avermectins has been purified from a mutant of Streptomyces avermitilis, which does not synthesize any avermectins but which converts avermectin aglycones to their respective disaccharides. This precursor has been identified as dTDP-oleandrose. The purification was achieved by anion exchange and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The purified nucleotide sugar had an absorption spectra characteristic of thymidine, released dTMP when treated with phosphodiesterase, and possessed an NMR spectrum in which three resonances characteristic of oleandrose were seen in addition to the thymidine signals. The enzyme, avermectin aglycone dTDP-oleandrose glycosyltransferase, which catalyzes the stepwise addition of oleandrose to the avermectin aglycones, has been demonstrated in cell-free extracts and (NH4)2SO4 fractions of cell-free extracts of S. avermitilis. The enzyme is specific for dTDP-oleandrose as the glycosyl donor but utilizes all avermectin aglycones as glycosyl acceptors. The stoichiometry between dTDP-oleandrose consumed in the reaction and oleandrose units transferred to the avermectin mono- and disaccharide was found to be 1:1."
https://openalex.org/W1600458438,"The molybdenum center of xanthine oxidase has been examined by resonance Raman spectroscopy. Making use of the long-wavelength absorption of the reduced molybdenum center in complex with violapterin (the product of enzymic action of lumazine), resonance Raman spectra were obtained using laser excitation at 676.4 nm. Several internal vibrational modes of violapterin were found to be resonance-enhanced, and a number of bands in the 250-1100 cm-1 range, presumably arising from vibrational modes of the molybdenum coordination sphere, were also observed. Upon substitution of 18O for 16O in the molybdenum coordination sphere, bands at 1469, 853, 517, 325, and 276 cm-1 exhibited shifts of 5-12 cm-1 to lower energy. By analogy to previous vibrational studies of Mo-O-Mo and Mo-O-R model compounds, the 853, 517, and 276 cm-1 frequencies were judged consistent with a labeled Mo-O-R linkage of the complexed violapterin. More importantly, the relatively small frequency shifts observed in these and other vibrations upon incorporation of 18O are very similar to those observed by others for 18O-labeled phenol and metal-phenolate complexes (Pinchas, S., Sadeh, D., and Samuel, D. (1965) J. Phys. Chem. 69, 2259-2264; Pyrz, W. J., Rue, L. A., Stern, L. J., and Que, L. J., Jr. (1985) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 107, 614-620) that model iron-tyrosinate proteins. The relatively small isotope-induced frequency shifts in multiple bands are thus interpreted as resulting from vibrational mixing of internal coordinates involving the oxygen atom with internal ring motions of the aromatic species. No oxygen isotope-sensitive bands were observed in the 900-1100 cm-1 region where Mo = O stretching modes typically occur. In agreement with the conclusions of previous workers (Davis, M.D., Olson, J. S., and Palmer, G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14730-14737) we interpret our results to indicate that the absorption band appearing upon complexation of violapterin with the molybdenum center of reduced xanthine oxidase is a molybdenum-to-violapterin charge-transfer band. These results, as well as several other lines of evidence, are consistent with direct coordination of violapterin to molybdenum in the charge-transfer complex via the 7-hydroxyl group (i.e. the hydroxyl group introduced into substrate by the enzyme). The Mo=O stretching mode of the complex is presumably not resonance enhanced because it is orthogonal to the charge-transfer electronic transition, suggesting that coordination of violapterin is cis to the oxo group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1562981017,"A mutant human lysozyme C77A, in which Cys-77 is replaced with Ala, was secreted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae as two proteins (C77A-a and C77A-b) with different specific activities. A peptide fragment from Val93 to Ala108 was obtained from C77A-a by pepsin digestion, and examined by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. The results showed that glutathione was attached to the thiol group of Cys95 of the fragment through a disulfide linkage. This observation was confirmed by quantitative formation of free glutathionesulfonic acid from C77A-a by performic acid treatment. In contrast, there was no modification in the case of C77A-b. These results indicate that C77A-a contained a mixed disulfide with glutathione attached to cysteine residue 95. In C77A-b, there appears to be a free thiol of Cys95 surrounded by many side chains, which was not modified by iodoacetic acid under native conditions, suggesting that the attachment of glutathione occurs during folding. These findings further suggest that in the oxidation step of disulfide bond formation in human lysozyme secreted by yeast, mixed disulfides are formed with glutathione and that posttranslational modification with glutathione can occur even in a protein secreted by yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1605264554,"Extracts of Klebsiella pneumoniae convert 5-S-methyl-5-thio-D-ribose (methylthioribose) to methionine and formate. To probe the terminal steps of this biotransformation, [1-13C]methylthioribose has been synthesized and its metabolism examined. When supplemented with Mg2+, ATP, L-glutamine, and dioxygen, cell-free extracts of K. pneumoniae converted 50% of the [1-13C]methylthioribose to [13C]formate. The formation of [13C]formate was established by 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy studies of the purified formate, and by 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry studies of its p-phenylphenacyl derivative. By contrast, no incorporation of label from [1-13C]methylthioribose into the biosynthesized methionine was detected by either mass spectrometry or 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The most reasonable interpretation of these results is that C-1 of methylthioribose is converted directly to formate concomitant with the conversion of carbon atoms 2-5 to methionine. The penultimate step in the conversion of methylthioribose to methionine and formate is an oxidative carbon-carbon bond cleavage reaction in which an equivalent of dioxygen is consumed. To investigate the fate of the dioxygen utilized in this reaction, the metabolism of [1-13C]methylthioribose in the presence of 18O2 was also examined. Mass spectrometry revealed the biosynthesis of substantial amounts of both [18O1]methionine and [13C, 18O1]formate under these conditions. These results suggest that the oxidative transformation in the conversion of methylthioribose to methionine and formate may be catalyzed by a novel intramolecular dioxygenase. A mechanism for this dioxygenase is proposed."

(1982) Biochemistry 21, 573-580) suggested that the metabolic lesion was at the level of 4-methyl sterol oxidation. However, the observed cellular accumulation of lanosterol was not consistent with a defect at this metabolic site. With the use of a novel Silica Sep Pak sterol separation procedure, we demonstrated that 60-80% of the acetonesoluble lipid radioactivity in [5-3H]mevalonate-labeled CHO-215 cells was incorporated into acidic sterols. 7(8),Cholesten-4 beta-methyl,4 alpha-carboxy,3 beta-ol was the dominant end product. In addition to this acidic sterol, 7(8),24-cholestadien,4 beta-methyl,4 alpha-carboxy,3 beta-ol and 7(8),24-cholestadien,4 alpha-carboxy,3 beta-ol were also isolated. Incubation of cell-free extracts with [3H]7(8)-cholesten-4 beta-methyl, 4 alpha-carboxy,3 beta-ol and pyridine nucleotides confirmed that CHO-215 4-carboxysterol decarboxylase activity was less than 1% of that for wild type cells. Thus, a correspondence between decreased 4-carboxysterol decarboxylase activity and the spectrum of accumulated sterol products by intact CHO-215 cells was demonstrated. No detectable cholesterol was synthesized by CHO-215 cells. 3H-Product accumulation studies demonstrated that 7(8),24-cholestadien, 4 beta-methyl,4 alpha-carboxy,3 beta-ol increased prior to its subsequent saturation at the delta 24 carbon. Furthermore, the steady state ratio for delta 24-saturated acidic sterols/unsaturated acidic sterols was dependent on media cholesterol source and amount.

This compound irreversibly inactivated both a crude detergent-dispersed adenylyl cyclase from rat brain and the partially purified enzyme from bovine brain. The irreversible inactivation by 100 to 200 microM 2',5'-dd3'-FSBA was blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by several established P-site inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase, 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine, 2'-d3'-AMP, adenosine, and 2'-deoxyadenosine, but not by inosine, N6-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine, adenine, 2'-d3':5'-cAMP, or 5'-AMP, agents known not to act at the P-site. Moreover, irreversible inactivation by 2',5'-dd3'-FSBA occurred in the presence of ATP at concentrations up to 3 mM, making it unlikely that inactivation was due to an effect on the enzyme's catalytic site. Adenylyl cyclase was also irreversibly inactivated by 5'-FSBA, although modestly (less than 20%) and apparently nonspecifically. Dithiothreitol protected the enzyme from irreversible inactivation by 2',5'-dd3'-FSBA, but reversible inhibition of the enzyme was still observed, although with reduced potency. When 2 mM dithiothreitol was added after a 30-min preincubation with 2',5'-dd3'-FSBA, the rat brain enzyme was partially (approximately 80%) reactivated. The data suggest that 2',5'-dd3'-FSBA may irreversibly inactivate adenylyl cyclase by reacting with a cysteinyl moiety in proximity to the P-site domain of the enzyme. These data together with results of studies of P-site inhibition kinetics published elsewhere (Johnson, R. A., and Shoshani, I. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11595-11600) strongly suggest that the P-site and catalytic site are distinct domains on the enzyme. 2',5'-dd3'-FSBA, and especially its radiolabeled analog, should prove to be a useful probe for structural studies of adenylyl cyclase, particularly with regard to the P-site."
https://openalex.org/W2109259730,"The anti-estrogen binding site (ABS) is an apparently ubiquitous component of cells that has been shown to be intimately linked with the antiproliferative effects of certain antiestrogenic compounds, like tamoxifen, which is currently used for the treatment of breast cancer. However, the identification and in vitro study of this novel protein has been hampered to date by a lack of convenient probes that will efficiently label the molecule in nonpurified preparations. Thus, using a selective ABS ligand (4-benzylphenoxy-N-ethylmorpholine, MBPE) as starting material, we synthesized a photosensitive azido derivative, [(2-azido-4-benzyl)phenoxy]N-ethylmorpholine (azido-MBPE) that can be prepared in a tritiated form. Azido-MBPE has a high affinity for ABS (Kd = 3 nM), identical to that of tamoxifen, and covalently labels 5 and 12% of membrane-bound and detergent-solubilized ABS, respectively. Its incorporation is selectively and competitively inhibited by other ABS ligands (tamoxifen greater than nitromifen greater than hydroxytamoxifen). [3H]Azido-MBPE potently photolabels either membrane-bound or detergent-solubilized ABS as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions revealing specific photoincorporation in a protein band of Mr = 40,000. This molecular weight is approximately two times lower than what we observed previously for ABS preparations studied under nondenaturing conditions and postlabeled with [3H]tamoxifen (Mr = 80,000-110,000). In chromatofocusing experiments with photolabeled ABS, a single specifically labeled protein fraction migrating with a pI of 6.4 was found to exhibit a Mr of 40,000 when subsequently electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. These results indicate that [3H]azido-MBPE is a specific high affinity probe of ABS that will prove useful in the ultimate identification of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1482640236,"A major control of gene expression occurs at the level of initiation of RNA transcription. In the nervous system this is reflected in part by 5' end RNA heterogeneity of neural transcripts. We now report the characterization of four preproenkephalin (ppEnk) RNA initiation sites in the rat brain striatum. In the adrenal medulla two ppEnk transcriptional start sites were detected. Moreover, cholinergic induction of ppEnk RNA initiation was observed in the adrenal medulla, but not in the striatum. The converse was true following handling stress. Our observations suggest that selective start site usage and stimulus evoked induction of specific RNA initiation is tissue-specific. We speculate that start site usage and induction may provide separate mechanisms through which neuronal gene expression is controlled in anatomically, as well as functionally distinct neurohumoral structures."

The presence of the perturbed Z-conformation required (CG) stretches longer than 32 bp and bilateral flanking by the AT-rich tracts, since plasmids with the (CG) tracts unilaterally flanked had an orthodox Z-structure. The thermodynamics of the negative super-coil-induced transitions were influenced only slightly by the neighboring AT-rich regions. Hence, the nature of Z-conformations in plasmids is markedly influenced by intrinsic structural features of the (Pur-Pyr) tract and by seemingly modest changes in the properties of neighboring sequences over a distance of several helical turns."
https://openalex.org/W1572788039,"The 3'-terminal tRNA-like structure of the tobacco mosaic virus RNA interacts with ATP/CTP:tRNA nucleotidyltransferases from Escherichia coli or yeast in much the same manner as do tRNAs. Primary sites of interaction cluster near the 3' end and in the loop proposed to be analogous to the psi-loop of a tRNA. Some modified bases in the tRNA-like structure inhibit interaction with nucleotidyltransferase, yet the analogous bases in a tRNA do not. The location of some of these nucleotides within the analog to the psi-loop suggests that this structure differs slightly from its counterpart in a tRNA. The location of other such bases in the helical stem near the 3' end can be explained if the pseudoknot is disrupted by these modified bases or if the tertiary structure of the RNA is altered in the enzyme-RNA complex. A partially denatured secondary structure that persists on denaturing gels is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1608618179,"By the kar1-mediated cytoduction, linear double-stranded DNA plasmids pGKL1 and pGKL2, encoding killer toxin complex, have been successfully transferred to the recipient strains with about 30% frequency. The killer toxin was found to be secreted through the normal yeast secretory pathway by introducing pGKL plasmids into the several Saccharomyces cerevisiae sec mutants and examining the secretion of killer toxin. S. cerevisiae cells, harboring newly isolated deletion plasmid pGKL1D, expressed only the 28K protein among three killer subunits, and secreted the 28K subunit at a level of zero to 20% efficiency of the cells containing intact pGKL1 plasmid. These data indicated that subunit interaction (cosecretion) of killer proteins is required for the efficient secretion of 28K subunit. The 28K precursor protein was found to translocate across the canine pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum membrane under the direction of its own signal peptide in vitro without any other subunits. From kex2 mutant cells harboring pGKL1 plasmid, the 97K subunit, and its precursor 128K protein were not secreted, however, the 28K subunit was secreted in the same amount as that secreted from KEX2 cells. These lines of evidence suggest that the final assembly of killer toxin complex after KEX2 site of Golgi apparatus is not essential for the secretion of 28K subunit, and therefore, that putative interaction between 128K protein and 28K subunit for the transport between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus may be required for the efficient secretion of 28K subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1548981150,"The gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is down-regulated as myoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle and commit to terminal differentiation. To localize cis-acting elements involved in regulating DHFR gene expression, the DHFR promoter and upstream region, together with differing amounts of contiguous intragenic sequence, were fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The resulting fusion genes were stably transformed into muscle cells, and CAT mRNA levels were measured in proliferative myoblasts and committed myocytes. A gene consisting of the -850/+465 region of DHFR (numbers refer to distance in base pairs from transcription initiation site) fused to CAT was efficiently expressed in proliferating myoblasts and was appropriately down-regulated during commitment. A gene consisting of the -850/+60 region of DHFR fused to CAT was poorly expressed in proliferating myoblasts and was not down-regulated during commitment. When inserted between the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and CAT sequence of RSVpCAT, the +61/+465 region of the DHFR gene augmented CAT mRNA expression in muscle cell transformants but did not confer a regulated pattern of expression. Our data indicate that DHFR sequences between +60 and +465 are required but are not sufficient for replication-dependent expression. The DHFR sequences may be operating at either a transcriptional or posttranscriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1584175173,"Single crystals of the thiamin diphosphate (the vitamin B1 coenzyme)-dependent enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1) from brewers' yeast have been grown using polyethylene glycol as a precipitating agent. Crystals of the homotetrameric version alpha 4 of the holoenzyme are triclinic, space group P1, with cell constants a = 81.0, b = 82.4, c = 116.6 A, alpha = 69.5 beta = 72.6, gamma = 62.4 degrees. The crystals are reasonably stable in a rotating anode x-ray beam and diffract to at least 2.5 A resolution. The Vm value of 2.55 A/dalton is consistent with a unit cell containing four subunits with mass of approximately 60 kDa each. Rotation function results with native data indicate strong non-crystallographic 222 symmetry relating the four identical subunits, thus density averaging methods are likely to play a role in the structure determination."
https://openalex.org/W1547761546,"The reaction pathway of enzyme-catalyzed acetylation of the acyl-accepting sites of the yeast synthase, a Ser-OH at the acetyl transacylase site, a Cys-SH at the beta-ketoacyl synthase site, and the acyl carrier protein 4'-phosphopantetheine-SH (Pant-SH), has been investigated using the chromophoric substrate, p-nitrophenyl thioacetate. The stoichiometry of acetylation of the native enzyme was 3 mol of acetate bound per mol of synthase unit, alpha beta (Mr 430,000). The acetylation process is biexponential; the rate constant of acetylation of the first 2 mol is 5.0 s-1 and the third mol is 0.2 s-1. The pathway by which acetyl moiety is added to the enzyme was determined by selectively blocking the acyl-accepting sites and subsequently determining the kinetics and stoichiometry of acetylation. The dibromopropanone-treated enzyme, in which the Pant-SH and Cys-SH are alkylated, exhibited an exponential burst of approximately 1 mol/mol of synthase unit with a rate constant of 11.0 s-1. The iodoacetamide-treated enzyme, in which Cys-SH is alkylated, had a biexponential burst with a total stoichiometry of approximately 2 mol/mol of synthase unit, with rate constants of 9 and 0.2 s-1, respectively. The kinetically competent acetylation to the extent of 2 and approximately 1 mol/mol of synthase unit for both Cys-SH and Cys-SH and Pant-SH-blocked enzymes, respectively, indicated that the route of acetyl transfer in the yeast synthase is obligatorily Ser-OH—-Cys-SH. The acetylation of Pant-SH (0.2 s-1) occurs with a rate insignificant to the process of fatty acid synthesis (turnover rate constant of 1.5 s-1). These conclusions are supported by experiments involving end point radiolabeling of the synthase with [1-14C]acetyl moieties using the substrate, p-nitrophenyl thio[1-14C]acetate. Native, dibromopropanone-treated, and iodoacetamide-treated enzymes bind about 3, 1, and 2 mol of acetyl/mol of synthase unit, respectively. Performic acid oxidation studies of the acetyl-labeled enzyme indicate that there is one Ser-O-acetyl formed in the native and alkylated enzymes and one Cys-S-acetyl and one Pant-S-acetyl formed in the native enzyme. Altogether, these results support our contention that the acetylation of the Pant-SH is kinetically incompetent. Thus, the yeast synthase transacetylation reactions occur by a novel process of acetyl transfer from CoA to Ser-OH—-Cys-SH, which is in contrast to the transfer from CoA to Ser-OH—-Pant-SH—-Cys-SH catalyzed by the prokaryotic synthases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1528176093,"Purified bovine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was used to investigate the effects of monovalent cations and alpha-ketoisovalerate on pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase inhibition by thiamin pyrophosphate. Initial velocity patterns for thiamin pyrophosphate inhibition were consistent with hyperbolic non-competitive or hyperbolic uncompetitive inhibition at various K+ concentrations between 0 and 120 mM. The Kis, Kid, and Kin for thiamin pyrophosphate were in the range of 0.009 to 5.1 microM over the range of K+ concentrations tested. In the absence of K+, 1 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate had no effect on PDH kinase inhibition by thiamin pyrophosphate, whereas in the presence of 20 mM K+, alpha-ketoisovalerate stimulated PDH kinase activity almost 2-fold over the range of 0-80 microM thiamin pyrophosphate. Half-maximal stimulation by alpha-ketoisovalerate occurred at about 200 microM in the presence of 100 microM thiamin pyrophosphate and 20 mM K+. Similar but less extensive changes occurred in the presence of 100 microM thiamin pyrophosphate and 1 mM NH4+. Initial velocity patterns for PDH kinase inhibition by thiamin pyrophosphate in the presence of 2 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate were mixed noncompetitive, but alpha-ketoisovalerate increased the Vm and Km for adenosine 5'-triphosphate in the presence of inhibitor. In the presence of thiamin pyrophosphate, PDH kinase remained stimulated after chromatography on Sephadex G-25 to remove alpha-ketoisovalerate. The results indicate that acylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by alpha-ketoisovalerate results in PDH kinase stimulation but only in the presence of monovalent cations and thiamin pyrophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1546778621,"Human glycophorin C (GPC) is an integral membrane protein found in many cell types but which exhibits increased expression in red cells. We have investigated the in vitro binding of nuclear protein factors to the GPC gene 5'-flanking region which was transcriptionally active when transfected into erythroid and non-erythroid cells. We found that in addition to known ubiquitous or erythroid trans-acting factors, a presently uncharacterized erythroid/megakaryocyte-specific protein binds the GPC promoter. This factor, that we called NFE-6, is present in embryonic, fetal, or adult-like human or mouse erythroleukemic cell lines, in a megakaryoblastic cell line, but not in lymphoid or non-hematopoietic cell lines. These data suggest that NFE-6, like the well characterized NFE-1 factor, is tissue- but not stage-specific and is conserved across species. It is proposed that NFE-6 might be involved in the quantitative change in the expression of the house-keeping GPC gene related to red cell specialization."
https://openalex.org/W1585966604,"The activation of factor X in the presence of antithrombin has been studied in order to determine the parameters that control the area under the resulting factor Xa generation curve. Generation curves were analyzed using a model containing three parameters: the total generation of factor Xa, Emax; the rate of factor Xa generation, expressed as a first-order rate constant, kappa 1; and the rate of inhibition, expressed as another first-order rate constant, kappa 2. Using factor IXa-VIIIa to activate factor X, we found the area under the generation curve to be proportional to Emax, which was varied by varying the factor IXa concentration, and inversely proportional to kappa 2, which was varied by varying the antithrombin concentration. With this activator, however, kappa 1 varied in parallel with Emax, resulting in a correlation between integrated area and kappa 1. In order to determine whether Emax or kappa 1, or both, was a controlling parameter, similar activations were done with varying concentrations of the factor X-activating enzyme of Russell's viper venom. With this activator it was possible to vary Emax and kappa 1 independently, again at varying antithrombin concentrations. These results showed the integrated area to be proportional to Emax and inversely proportional to kappa 2, as before, but independent of the activation rate, kappa 1. In this system, therefore, the area under the factor Xa generation curve is controlled by the amount of factor Xa generated and its rate of inhibition but is independent of the rate of factor Xa generation."
