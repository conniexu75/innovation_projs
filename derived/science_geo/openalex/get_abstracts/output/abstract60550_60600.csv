https://openalex.org/W1495600170,"Abstract The 85-residue structure of Chromatium high potential iron protein (HiPIP) has been determined by x-ray diffraction methods at 2.0 A resolution, and is currently undergoing crystallographic refinement. The partially refined HiPIP structure reported here has an R factor of 0.24. Moreover, bond distances and angles have been constrained to their expected values, so that a model may be constructed from standard brass parts. Thus, it is an unusually well determined protein structure. The Fe4S*4 cluster (Carter, C. W., Jr., Freer, S. T., Xuong, Ng. H., Alden, R. A., and Kraut, J. (1971) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 36, 381–385) is covalently attached to the protein by Fe—S bonds at cysteine residues 43, 46, 63, and 77. Residues 1–42 fold up upon this cluster binding segment. Most of the interface between these NH2- and COOH-terminal segments consists of packed nonpolar side chains. The chain segment containing Cys 77 is trapped inside this interface where it forms a stretch of antiparallel β sheet with residues 17–20 in the NH2-terminal half of the chain. This unusual architecture probably accounts for the relatively high stability of HiPIP (Dus, K., DeKlerk, H., Sletten, K., and Bartsch, R. G. (1967) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 140, 291–311). The Tyr 19 side chain abuts the Fe4S*4 cluster in a manner similar to that observed for Tyr 2 and Tyr 28 in Peptococcus aerogenes ferredoxin (Adman, E. T., Sieker, L. C., and Jensen, L. H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3987–3996). The polypeptide chain conformation may be described, almost in its entirety, as a sequence of α helical or extended conformations and hairpin turns. Moreover, most of these secondary structures are surprisingly close in their detailed geometry to those predicted to be of lowest energy. More than 75% of the main chain hydrogen bonding sites are bonded either within secondary structures (47%) or to water (30%). Thus these bonds may be formed prior to complete assembly of the entire structure. Hairpin turns are conspicuously associated with the protein-water interface: they contain a large majority of the polar side chains and their main chain carbonyl oxygen and amido nitrogen atoms bind a disproportionately large fraction of the fixed water molecules. Sequence-structure correlations of the type proposed by Robson and Pain (Robson, B., and Pain, R. H. (1971) J. Mol. Biol. 58, 237–259) and Lewis et al. (Lewis, P. N., Momany, F. A., and Scheraga, H. A. (1971) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 68, 2293–2297) turn out to be quite accurate, and the most serious discrepancy between predicted and observed structures can be rationalized convincingly in terms of Fe4S*4 cluster binding requirements. These observations appear to weigh heavily against theories of protein folding which involve early, nonspecific micelle formation (Robson, B., and Pain, R. H. (1971) J. Mol. Biol. 58, 237–259)."

https://openalex.org/W1488034448,"Abstract The three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin from the bloodworm, Glycera dibranchiata, has been determined crystallographically to a resolution of 2.5 A using three isomorphous heavy atom derivatives. Approximately 79% of the 147 amino acid residues are in seven helical segments which are disposed in the familiar myoglobin fold. The heme group is enclosed in a hydrophobic cavity which is formed by the particular folding of the polypeptide chain. The D helix is absent and the position usually occupied by the distal histidine in vertebrate hemoglobins is occupied by leucine."

The finding that these proteins are not confined to lower vertebrates but have been conserved throughout evolution strongly suggests that they must possess a definite physiological function possibly related to the contractile process."

https://openalex.org/W1596518827,"Abstract Microsomal preparations from rat brain in the presence of Mg2+ hydrolyzed the ethanolamine, choline, and phosphate moieties from 1-[1-14C]hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine, 1-[1-14C]hexadec-1-enyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine, and 1-[1-14C]hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine. Studies of the hydrolysis of 1-[1-14C]-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine in this system indicated that the ethanolamine moiety was first removed by a phosphodiesterase to form 1-[1-14C]hexadecylglycero-3-phosphate which was then dephosphorylated to form 1-[1-14C]hexadecylglycerol. Only minimal hydrolysis occurred when the 2-positions of the substrates were acylated; otherwise the phosphodiesterase activity was similar to that of phospholipase D from plants. The occurrence of such a lysophospholipase D pathway has not been previously reported. When Ca2+ (5 mm) was added to the system instead of Mg2+ (5 mm), little, if any, stimulation occurred; higher concentrations of Ca2+ (25 mm) inhibited the reaction. Therefore, this reaction does not appear to be related to the Ca2+-stimulated base exchange reaction found in the brain by others."

https://openalex.org/W1576583745,"Abstract Long chain fatty acyl coenzyme A esters were found to be potent inhibitors of adenine nucleotide translocation in both rat and guinea pig liver mitochondria. There was a positive correlation of inhibition with the carbon chain length and carnitine-dependent oxidation of the fatty acyl-CoA esters. Octanoyl-CoA was completely ineffective at concentrations up to 50 µm. Esters containing a greater number of carbon atoms produced significant inhibition at concentrations as low as 5 µm. Both saturated and unsaturated acyl-CoA esters were effective inhibitors, although there was some difference in effectiveness depending upon the concentration. Palmitoyl-CoA was shown to inhibit binding competitively with ADP in both nucleotide depleted mitochondria and Lubrol membrane fragments. The mode of inhibition and sensitivity of adenine nucleotide translocase to the acyl-CoA esters appeared to be similar to that produced by atractylate. Under conditions studied, the concentration of carnitine acyltransferase enzyme(s) did not influence the inhibition produced by the acyl-CoA esters. Phosphoenolpyruvate, known to be transported on the tricarboxylate carrier, also was found to be transported by the adenine nucleotide translocase in both rat and guinea pig liver mitochondria. In addition the tricarboxylate as well as adenine nucleotide translocator was inhibited by atractylate as well as long chain fatty acyl-CoA esters. These results suggest an important function of long chain fatty acyl-CoA esters in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolite transport."

https://openalex.org/W1601288583,"Abstract To gain information concerning the location of the five disulfide bonds of the common, α, subunit of pituitary thyrotropin and luteinizing hormone, bovine thyrotropin-α and luteinizing hormone-α were partially reduced with low concentrations of dithioerythritol, and the resulting cysteine residues were labeled with [1-14C]iodoacetic acid. The labeled subunits were then completely reduced and carboxymethylated with nonradioactive iodoacetic acid. Peptides containing S-carboxymethylcysteine were isolated from samples labeled after different conditions of partial reduction. Determination of the specific radioactivities of the S-carboxymethylcysteines indicated the initial simultaneous opening of two bridges involving half-cystines at positions 11, 14, 35, and 36 of the α sequence (Liao, T.-H., and Pierce, J. G. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 850–865) with disulfide bonds most likely between half-cystines 11, 14 with either 35 and 36, or 36 and 35. The distribution of radioactivity in the other half-cystine positions indicates bonds between residues 32–64, 63–91, and 86–88."
https://openalex.org/W1491621039,"Abstract A method is described for the preparation of homogeneous insulin from the pancreatic tissue of the guinea pig. The amino acid composition of this insulin and of the separated S-sulfonated chains demonstrated that the primary structure of the molecule was intact. Guinea pig insulin sedimented as a monomer in analytical ultracentrifugation, even in the presence of equimolar zinc ion. Ultraviolet absorbance difference spectrophotometry showed that certain hydrogen bonds which may be involved in stabilizing the monomer, and possibly the hexameric aggregate, in crystalline bovine or porcine insulin may not exist in guinea pig insulin. The reason for the failure of guinea pig insulin to dimerize may be related to the replacement of the B-22 arginine by aspartic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1553873077,"Abstract A novel use of Edman degradation was made in the study of desmosine- and isodesmosine-containing elastolytic peptides of bovine ligamentum nuchae elastin. The elastolysis of elastin produced peptides with the cleavage at or near the NH2-terminals of desmosine and isodesmosine cross-links. Therefore, it became possible to release single chain peptides from the carboxyl groups of these cross-links with the use of Edman degradation. This approach permitted the isolation and sequencing of seven unique peptides from bovine ligamentum nuchae elastin; the sequences of five such peptides from porcine aortic elastin were also determined. The comparison of the sequences of these peptides with the NH2-terminal sequences of porcine tropoelastin tryptic peptides (Foster, J. A., Bruenger, E., Gray, W. R., and Sandberg, L. B. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 2876–2879) permitted the identification of 12 possible lysine sequences which may be involved in cross-link formation. On the basis of the available data on elastin and tropoelastin, it is proposed that the tropoelastin molecule contains six pairs of lysines in the sequence -Lys-Ala-Ala-Lys- and six additional pairs of lysines in the sequence -Lys-Ala-Ala-Ala-Lys- and that two such pairs meet to form desmosine or isodesmosine cross-links."
https://openalex.org/W1603290388,"Abstract Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomes were isolated from ovaries of Xenopus laevis. Subunits prepared from these ribosomes have relatively low poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesizing activity when tested separately, but regain at least 80% of the activity of the original ribosomes when mixed. Buoyant densities in analytical CsCl gradients and chemical measurements of RNA and protein content indicate that cytoplasmic large (1.626 g per cm3; 58% RNA) and small (1.553 g per cm3; 50% RNA) subunits are less protein rich and contain a smaller mass of protein than mitochondrial large (1.447 g per cm3; 32% RNA) and small (1.448 g per cm3; 20% RNA) subunits. We suggest that in comparison to 80 S cytoplasmic ribosomes, the lower sedimentation coefficient of 55 to 60 S mitochondrial ribosomes is due equally to their lower particle mass (3.5 versus 4.0 x 106 daltons) and to their lower density. Proteins extracted from separated subunits were fractionated and their number and molecular weights were estimated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins present in different subunits were compared by co-electrophoresis of trace amounts of 125I-labeled and stainable amounts of unabeled proteins. Cytoplasmic large and small subunits contain 37 and 34 proteins, respectively; at least 65, but more likely all 71, of these proteins are distinct. Mitochondrial large and small subunits contain 40 and 44 proteins, respectively, at least 77, but more likely all 84, of these proteins are distinct. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal subunits share few, if any, of these 155 proteins. Xenopus mitochondrial DNA can encode at most onesixth of the mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. Therefore, most, if not all, mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2003753651,Membrane affinity for the neurotransmitter norepinephrine is rapidly but reversibly decreased in nerve terminals of the cerebral cortex by intense nervous stimulation. This should adaptively facilitate alerting during acute emergency and stress. The Michaelis constant (K(m)) for the high-affinity active uptake of norepinephrine into crude synaptosome-rich homogenates of the cerebral cortices of mice was increased 68 percent after 15 minutes of intense fighting and 110 percent 5 minutes after a single electroconvulsive shock. These changes were no longer evident 18 to 20 hours later.

https://openalex.org/W1525783847,"Abstract The subunit molecular weight of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase is reported to be 25,000 for the Chinese hamster enzyme (Olsen, A. S., and Milman, G. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4030) and 34,500 for the human enzyme (Arnold, W. J., and Kelley, W. N. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 7398–7404). To investigate this difference the enzyme was purified from human erythrocytes by the method reported to give a 34,500 molecular weight subunit. Although the purification produces what appears to be a single active band on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, the major protein components observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels are not derived from the enzyme. Instead, activity is associated with a minor component of subunit molecular weight 26,000. Heating at 85° in the presence of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate yields complete recovery of enzyme activity, removes contaminating proteins, and leaves only a 26,000 molecular weight subunit. Thus the enzyme from both species appears to have the same subunit molecular weight of 25,000 to 26,000."

https://openalex.org/W2078525638,"THE high incidence of spontaneous leukaemias in AKR mice may be explained by the early appearance and high level of replication of a type C virus. It is often suggested, however, that in addition, AKR mice could be tolerant to their leukaemias. This tolerance would enhance the in vivo growth of malignant cells. In fact, AKR mice are not completely devoid of antileukaemic immune response1–5. It would be interesting, therefore, to determine if a quantitative or qualitative defect of one given type of antileukaemic response exists in AKR mice. Previous work has shown that an antibody response directed against the type C virus or against antigens of leukaemic cells can be demonstrated not only in hyperimmune1 but also in normal AKR mice4. A cell mediated reaction directed against G (Gross)6 leukaemia antigen-bearing cells was also detected in vitro5,7 but this cell-mediated reaction was characterised by inhibition of the growth of G+ cells in monolayers. It is now known, however, that this kind of inhibition can be due to non-T cells7–9 and could be antibody dependent10. A completely different cell-mediated antitumour reaction can be evidenced in the murine sarcoma virus (MSV) induced tumour system by the chromium release test (CRT) which detects a pure T-cell-mediated11,12 and antibody-independent13 cytolysis of tumour cells. Our work was performed to determine if AKR mice are capable of spontaneously developing such a kind of T-killer cell response."

This increased ingestion occurred even with high concentrations of lead acetate which normal weanlings found extremely aversive. Chronic injections of lead acetate into weanlings did not change lead ingestion, indicating an absence of behavioral regulation of body lead levels. Female lead-injected weanlings did show a significant increase in calcium ingestion. Calcium deficiency may be one component of lead pica."

https://openalex.org/W1630603894,"Abstract Active amino acid transport in Staphylococcus aureus U-71 membrane vesicles is coupled to either α-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase or l-lactate dehydrogenase depending upon the growth conditions of the parent cells. Vesicles prepared from cells grown on gluconate as a primary carbon source exhibit an absolute specificity for α-glycerol phosphate as a physiological electron donor for transport, whereas vesicles prepared from cells grown on glucose as a primary carbon source exhibit an absolute specificity for l-lactate as an electron donor for transport. Both preparations exhibit similar dehydrogenase activities qualitatively, indicating that the coupling between these dehydrogenases and transport is altered. l-Lactate oxidation, l-lactate:dichlorophenolindophenol reductase activity, and l-lactate-dependent amino acid transport exhibit similar apparent Michaelis constants with respect to l-lactate, indicating that l-lactate oxidation per se is the rate-limiting step for amino acid transport in the appropriate membrane preparation. Amino acid transport is dependent on electron transfer, and inhibition of l-lactate oxidation by anaerobiosis, cyanide, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, amytal, and oxalate is directly related to inhibition of amino acid transport. However, only anaerobiosis, cyanide, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, and amytal, each of which inhibits electron transfer after the site of energy coupling, cause efflux. Oxalate, a potent inhibitor of l-lactate dehydrogenase, does not cause efflux despite almost complete inhibition of l-lactate oxidation and amino acid transport. Moreover, oxalate blocks or inhibits efflux caused by each of the other inhibitors and by 2,4-dinitrophenol. These results provide further evidence that active transport is dependent on the oxidation-reduction potential of the respiratory chain at the site of energy coupling. Cyanide-induced efflux is a saturable process with an apparent affinity constant that is approximately 500 times higher than the affinity constant for active transport. The apparent maximum velocity of efflux, on the other hand, is the same as that of active transport. These findings suggest that one of the primary effects of energy coupling is to change the affinity of the carrier for substrate. Under anaerobic conditions serine uptake exhibits linear kinetics, indicating that the rate-limiting step for serine uptake under these conditions is a nonsaturable process with an infinite Km. Moreover, approximately 5 min is required for external serine to equilibrate with the intramembranal pool at a variety of concentrations. Thus, it is highly unlikely that facilitated diffusion is the rate-limiting step for active serine uptake."

https://openalex.org/W1523638813,"Abstract Initiation of sheep globin synthesis was studied to determine if a unique initiation mechanism might be a control point for hemoglobin A to C switching. Polysomes from the reticulocytes of anemic adult sheep direct cell-free synthesis of sheep α-, βb-, and/or βc-globin chains. The first two amino acids on the NH2 terminus of these three globins are valine-leucine, methionine-leucine, and proline-asparagine, respectively. The initiator tRNA, methionyl-tRNAf, donates [35S]methionine to the βb chain but not to the α or βc. When methionine on the initiator tRNA is formylated, formyl[35S]methionine is donated to all three globins. α-, βb-, and βc-Globins with an NH2-terminal formylmethionine were isolated from the cell-free reaction by carboxymethylcellulose chromatography and subjected to deformylation and proteolytic digestion. [35S]Methionine on formylmethionine α-globin is released as free methionine, methionine-valine, or methionine-valine-leucine (as determined by electrophoresis and chromatography). Similarly, the [35S]methionine on formylmethionine βb-globin is released as methionine-leucine. Conditions were not found which would cleave a dipeptide from the formylmethionine βc chain, so the globin was labeled with [3H]proline, [3H]asparagine, or [3H]lysine in addition to [35S]methionine and subjected to automated Edman degradation. The data show that the initial sequence of formylmethionine βc is methionine-proline-asparaginelysine. We conclude that methionyl-tRNAf initiates all three globin chains but that this methionine is subsequently cleaved from the α and βc chains. We infer that βa globin is initiated in a manner similar to βb because their NH2-terminal sequences are identical. Thus, the mechanism of sheep globin initiation is similar to that of rabbit and human globin initiation; this conclusion suggests a pretranslational control for hemoglobin switching in the sheep."

https://openalex.org/W1486092141,"Abstract Achlya is a filamentous coenocytic fungus that grows only in the presence of Ca2+. The Ca2+ transport (uptake and binding) system of this organism was studied and shown to consist of two components: a low molecular weight Ca2+ binding glycopeptide present within the cell wall matrix and a Ca2+ uptake component associated with the cell membrane. Certain thiol group-reacting agents and cytokinin-active compounds enhanced Ca2+ binding and uptake, respectively. Ca2+ transport by intact cells showed pH dependence with optima at pH 6.5 and 8.5 and temperature dependence with maximal transport occurring at 40° (without activation) and 15° (with activation). Ca2+ transport proceeded by facilitated diffusion. The system is insensitive to metabolic inhibitors. Compounds with known cytokinin activity stimulated the release of Ca2+ bound to the cell wall glycopeptide, and these same compounds enhanced Ca2+ intake into osmotically shocked cells (lacking the glycopeptide). The half-saturation values for Ca2+ intake into cells and release from the glycopeptide are essentially identical."

https://openalex.org/W1492420088,"Abstract Tryptophan residues of bovine α-lactalbumin, one of the two protein components of lactose synthetase, were selectively sulfenylated with 2-nitrophenylsulfenyl chloride. When the reaction was performed in 0.1 m acetic acid for 1 hour, a modified protein containing 1.0 nitrophenylsulfenyl tryptophan residue per α-lactalbumin molecule was formed and isolated in 42% yield. Upon reduction, carboxymethylation, and trypsin digestion, this sulfenylated α-lactalbumin (NPS1-αLA) yielded two yellow peptides. Amino acid composition of these peptides indicated that in NPS1-αLA, tryptophan residues 60 and 118 were equally sulfenylated to the extent of 0.5 nitrophenylsulfenyl tryptophan per α-lactalbumin. NPS1-αLA cross-reacts with anti-α-lactalbumin antibodies, but, unlike the native protein, it has no biological activity in the lactose synthesis reaction, and its electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels is different from that of native α-lactalbumin."

Some experiments with pox viruses involving partially inactivated virus or various metabolic inhibitors suggest a correlation between the production of virus proteins and the appearance of cytopathic effects without necessarily establishing a casual relationship between the two events1,2. Other work suggests that inhibition of host protein synthesis, and by extension induction of cytopathic effects by vaccinia virus, is independent of virus-induced protein synthesis but is some function of the virus particle itself3. Here, we report direct experiments in which vaccinia-specific materials were isolated from infected HeLa cells, rendered free from infective virus and shown to be toxic to susceptible uninfected HeLa cells under appropriate test conditions. To our knowledge this is the first documented example of an observable cell-killing effect of vaccinia specific protein(s). It differs from that of the penton capsomere (toxin) of adenovirus which affects cell membranes from the outside causing them to detach from glass4, in that we believe it acts intracellularly."
