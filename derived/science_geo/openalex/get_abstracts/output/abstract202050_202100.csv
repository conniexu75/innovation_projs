https://openalex.org/W2092979675,"When a mammalian cell strain was incubated with 5-iododeoxyuridine and 5-bromodeoxyuridine, DNA thymine was partially replaced by the halogen-containing pyrimidines. The extent of incorporation of the unnatural bases increased when amethopterin and hypoxanthine were added to the medium. It is thus evident that the replacement of DNA thymine by selected structural analogs, a phenomenon previously reported for bacterial systems, is applicable to cells of higher organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2003305258,It appears that obese animals retain proportionally more steroid hormones than nonobese animals. The retention of these hormones does not appear to be a function of the nature of the obesity syndrome but simply a function of the increased fat content.

https://openalex.org/W2042913170,"The fluorescence assay method has been used in the identification and quantitative estimation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in mollusks. Ganglia of a representative pelecypod contain more 5-HT than those of a gastropod. Most non-nerve tissues have low levels of 5-HT, which, except in ""kidneys,"" may derive from nerve endings."

https://openalex.org/W2093323607,"The presence of organic material in some manganese-rich nodules suggests that the nodules are of biological origin. This suggestion leads to the proposal that in sea water, heavy metals get protection from hydrolysis by organic complexing; parts of these complexes become metabolized, the remaining parts then precipitate. These processes would explain a number of interesting observations."
https://openalex.org/W1997345988,"WEBER1 has recently reported on the intramolecular transfer of excitation energy in dihydrodiphosphopyridine nucleotide. In addition to the strong band having its maximum at 340 mµ, the excitation spectrum of the 462 mµ fluorescence also shows a maximum at 260 mµ, a region where the absorption is due to the purine part of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2098465079,All tested stocks of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit a peptide in males but not in females. The failure of some investigators to demonstrate its presence is attributable to their choice of chromatographic solvents. Acid hydrolysis confirms its peptide identity. Its presence in females transformed into males by the mutant tra implicates the sex-determining loci in its formation.

https://openalex.org/W2083778147,"The effect of beta-propiolactone on chromosomes is independent of pH, oxygen tension, and some metabolic inhibitors. It is influenced by temperature, concentration, and pretreatments with dinitrophenol. henol. Interphase sensitivitycalizationand localization of breaks are discussed in terms of the action of beta-propiolactone and the relationship of gamma-propiolactone to other radiomimetic compounds."

https://openalex.org/W2014081663,In vitro x-irradiation of frog and Amphiuma erythrocytes caused cytophysiological damage to part of the cell population. There was a significant decrease in the percentage of normal cells and some hemolysis. Changes were also observed in the electrical capacitance and potassium-42 uptake of irradiated erythrocytes.
https://openalex.org/W2023099004,The response of the node of Ranvier can be prolonged up to 5 to 6 seconds by addition to the medium of minute amounts of certain metal ions. This prolongation involves a change from a triangular to a rectangular configuration. The properties of the prolonged nerve-fiber responses are very similar to those of heart muscle.
https://openalex.org/W2065140564,"A pepsin-like enzyme has been found in larvae of the stable fly. The activity is detectable in homogenates of whole larvae and in homogenates of isolated midguts, the latter of which possess a pH environment low enough to support a peptic enzyme. The pH optimum of the activity was determined to be 2.4."

https://openalex.org/W2017984581,"Radioactive nicotine was synthesized by Nicotiana rustica L. which was fed sodium acetate-1-C14, sodium acetate-2-C14, sodium pyruvate-1-C14, or sodium pyruvate-3-C14. Acetate-2-C14 and pyruvate-3-C14 were converted to nicotine with the least dilution of radioisotope, whereas pyruvate-1-C14 was incorporated with a relatively large dilution. When acetate-1-C14 was administered to the plants the nicotine contained C14 only in the pyrrolidine ring. After acetate-2-C14 was fed, C14 was located in both the pyrrolidine and pyridine rings."
https://openalex.org/W2002950064,The oral administration of phenylpyruvic acid to human subjects results in increased urinary excretion of o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. This demonstrates that phenylpyruvic acid may act as a precursor for o-hydroxy derivatives of phenylalanine and suggests that the formation of o-tyrosine is not necessary to account for the excretion of o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in phenylketonuria.
https://openalex.org/W2001692118,"When Stentor coeruleus was cut into anterior and posterior halves, the micronuclei in the posterior half underwent mitosis about 5 to 6 hours later, as shown in stained preparations. It is suggested that the division of the micronuclei was initiated by metabolic changes which resulted from the lack of adoral membranelles."
https://openalex.org/W2153315035,"Adults of three species of mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles quadrimaculatus and Culex pipiens, showed essentially similar patterns of nitrogen output as judged by their excretion of total nitrogen and by their excretion of nitrogen as uric acid, urea, ammonia, amino acid, and protein. About 80 percent of their total nitrogen has been accounted for. Substances that seem on analysis to be like glycoprotein have been found in the excreta of the three species."
https://openalex.org/W1996518171,Force-area diagrams for monolayers of stearic acid on Ringer's solution demonstrate a competition between veratrine and calcium for carboxyl groups of the films. The competition occurs at customary concentrations. Local anesthetics act quite differently. The interactions suggest those observed less directly in living cells and therefore indicate that such surface films may serve as models for the study of drug and ion effects.
https://openalex.org/W2030719625,Excised anthers of Allium cepa and Rhoeo discolor have been successfully cultured in modified White's medium supplemented with various concentrations of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid. Ribonucleic acid proved to be much more useful than deoxyribonucleic acid and reduced the time required for the completion of meiosis from 48 hours to 24 hours. The role of nucleic acids in the control of nuclear divisions has been indicated.
https://openalex.org/W2062068735,"Prolonged, intense auditory stimulation caused a marked reduction in glutathione levels in the blood of female rats. The frequency of the response was significant statistically and was related inversely to the recovery rate after auditory stimulation. An increase in adrenal weights and ascorbic acid, as well as a decrease in total adrenal cholesterol, were noted."

https://openalex.org/W2007717038,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PC) show contrasting levels in muscle and liver after short and long periods of hibernation. In prolonged hibernation cardiac and skeletal muscle PC continues to maintain ATP, but at lower levels. In the liver, control levels for these compounds are regained."
https://openalex.org/W2073425704,"Although reddish-yellow pigments, mainly §-carotene and rubixanthine, were present in the original strain of Micrococcus pyogenes var. aureus , mutants highly resistant to tetracyclines were observed to become colorless. All strains lack lipoxidase activity. The colorless strains probably reflect blocking by tetracyclines during carotenogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2061655009,"Studies of leukemia in populations receiving small amounts of radiation are needed to investigate the question of a threshold dose. Estimates have been made of the population sizes required to detect a statistically significant increment of leukemia at specified low exposures, by means of the dose-response relation observed by Court-Brown and Doll at high doses."
https://openalex.org/W1979481525,A positive relationship exists between the number of times a subject responds with a psychogalvanic response to an orienting or alerting stimulus (tone) and the rate of learning in classical conditioning. This is seen by a correlation (p=.65 and .643 when corrected for ties) between the number of orienting responses and the resistance to extinction of the conditioned psychogalvanic response.
https://openalex.org/W2007821222,"A new method has been developed for removing the nucleic acid portion of the nucleoprotein fraction which stimulates growth in tissue culture. Biological activity resides in the purified protein fraction, while the high-polymer nucleic acid fraction is inert. The active protein fraction contains extractable lipids which have no effect on the biological activity."

https://openalex.org/W2076986975,"Light-dark cycles with 12-hour and 16-hour photoperiods are known to be effective in 24-hour cycles in inducing gonadal activity and fat deposition in migratory birds. Twenty-four-hour cycles with 16-hour dark periods are not effective. To test the role of the light periods and the dark periods in a given cycle, slate-colored juncos were subjected to light in cycles which combined stimulatory photoperiods (L) and inhibitory dark periods (D) as follows: 12L-16D; 12L-20D; 16L-16D; 16L-22D; 16L-32D. The results indicate that the photoperiod, not the dark period, determined the response."
https://openalex.org/W1965619929,"A solution to be desalted is placed on a paper strip along which an ammonium formate buffer gradient has been established. Application of a potential brings about migration of amino acids to their isoelectric pH's and removal of salt ions. The strip is eluted with water, and the eluate is freed of ammonium formate by vacuum sublimation at 40 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W2003933105,"IT has been shown that the pars distalis of the pituitary gland of the cat, rabbit1 and dog2,3 contains cells which stain with carmine or acid fuchsin. These cells have been described as a second type of acidophile. They appear during the first pro-œstrous period in the young female cat, extend to occupy larger areas during œstrus and then partially regress4."
https://openalex.org/W2054191953,"In discussing the reality of a peripheral duality of pain-afferent systems, which she attributes to an artifact [Science 128, 713 (1958)], M. H. Jones rejects as valueless data concerning differences in the velocity of conduction of nerve impulses as determined by reaction times. Yet precise data tend to show the reality of these differences in velocity."
https://openalex.org/W2066145066,"MANY different methods have been applied by several authors to the separation of mono- and di-n-butyl phosphate. Kumler and Eiler1, who were interested in obtaining pure samples for the determination of their dissociation constants, used fractional precipitation of barium salts. Extraction by organic solvents (n-amylic alcohol or dibutylic ether) was applied with a good yield by Stewart and Crandall2; di-n-butyl phosphate is preferentially extracted into the organic phase. With the aim of obtaining mono- and di-n-butyl phosphate labelled with phosphorus-32, after the isotopic transfer of phosphorus-32 from H3
32PO4 to the esters, the exchange resin ‘Dowex 2 X–8’, 100–200 mesh, chloride form, was used by Higgins and Baldwin3 to separate the three components from each other. Thus the mixture at pH 9 was fixed at the top of the resin bed; ortho-phosphoric acid, mono- and di-n-butyl phosphate were consecutively obtained by eluting with 0.05 M hydrochloric acid and with 0.5 M potassium chloride."
