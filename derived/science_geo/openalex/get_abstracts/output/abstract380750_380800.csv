Despite advances in understanding the molecular basis of this process, the membrane origin of autophagosomes remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that, in starved cells, the outer membrane of mitochondria participates in autophagosome biogenesis. The early autophagosomal marker, Atg5, transiently localizes to punctae on mitochondria, followed by the late autophagosomal marker, LC3. The tail-anchor of an outer mitochondrial membrane protein also labels autophagosomes and is sufficient to deliver another outer mitochondrial membrane protein, Fis1, to autophagosomes. The fluorescent lipid NBD-PS (converted to NBD-phosphotidylethanolamine in mitochondria) transfers from mitochondria to autophagosomes. Photobleaching reveals membranes of mitochondria and autophagosomes are transiently shared. Disruption of mitochondria/ER connections by mitofusin2 depletion dramatically impairs starvation-induced autophagy. Mitochondria thus play a central role in starvation-induced autophagy, contributing membrane to autophagosomes.

Mitochondria thus play a central role in starvation-induced autophagy, contributing membrane to autophagosomes. Autophagosomes are derived from mitochondrial outer membrane during starvation Lipids, but not most proteins, are transferred from mitochondria to autophagosomes Mitochondria-ER connections are required to form autophagosomes during starvation Mitochondrial contribution to autophagosome assembly is unique to starvation During starvation, many organisms retrieve nutrients via degradation of their own intracellular components. This process is termed macroautophagy, or simply autophagy—“self eating.” Autophagy is initiated by formation of multilamellar organelles that engulf cytosol en masse. Lysosomes subsequently fuse with autophagosomes and deliver lysosomal proteases. Captured substrates are thereby degraded, and transporters and permeases in the membrane move components released by catabolism back to the cytosol (Xie and Klionsky, 2007Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Autophagosome formation: core machinery and adaptations.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Autophagy during starvation is utilized throughout the eukaryotic domain. S. cerevisiae autophagy mutants rapidly die when cells are deprived of nitrogen and carbon (Scott et al., 1996Scott S.V.

Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. The role of autophagy during the early neonatal starvation period.Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). An important question regarding starvation-induced autophagosomes is where these organelles originate from. Nearly all proteins involved in inception and maturation of autophagosomes are cytosolic proteins that are recruited to membranes (Xie and Klionsky, 2007Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Autophagosome formation: core machinery and adaptations.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Proteomic studies have identified peripheral proteins but not a clear signature of membrane origin (Overbye et al., 2007Overbye A. Fengsrud M. Seglen P.O. Proteomic analysis of membrane-associated proteins from rat liver autophagosomes.Autophagy. 2007; 3: 300-322PubMed Google Scholar), and reports have implicated membrane contribution from disparate sources including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), trans Golgi network (TGN) and mitochondria (Axe et al., 2008Axe E.L.

Electron microscopy (EM) tomography has revealed close apposition of ER and phagophore membranes, most apparent when phagophore maturation is blocked (Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009Hayashi-Nishino M. Fujita N. Noda T. Yamaguchi A. Toshimori T. Yamamoto A. A subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum forms a cradle for autophagosome formation.Nat.

Eskelinen E.L. 3D tomotgraphy redeals connections between the phagophore and endoplasmic reticulum.Autophagy. 2009; 5: 1180-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). These studies implicate involvement of the ER in autophagy, but it remains unclear whether this is a specific form of autophagy–ER-phagy–or whether the ER contributes to all autophagosome formation (Reggiori and Tooze, 2009Reggiori F. Tooze S.A. The EmERgence of autophagosomes.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 747-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because different membranes have been implicated in autophagosome biogenesis, it is possible the membrane origin of autophagosomes is variable. Here, we investigate formation of starvation-induced autophagosomes and uncover a mechanism involving contribution from the outer membrane of mitochondria that occurs during starvation but not ER stress. We show mitochondrial-derived membranes are utilized during autophagy and that autophagosome formation is dependent on ER/mitochondria connections modulated by mitofusin2 (Mfn2). These connections likely replenish mitochondrial lipid utilized for autophagic growth. We further identify a lipid anchor sequence that allows transfer of proteins from mitochondria to autophagosomes. Starvation-induced autophagosomes were studied in a clonal Normal Rat Kidney cell line expressing cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fused to LC3 (line NRK58B). LC3 (MAP1LC3, rat homolog of S. cerevisiae Atg8p) is a canonical autophagosome marker (Kabeya et al., 2000Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T.

Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Under replete growth conditions, CFP-LC3 was distributed between cytosolic and nuclear pools, with very little observed on autophagic membranes. Replacement of growth media with DPBS, HBSS or serum-free media induced a starvation response, and CFP-LC3 was recruited to autophagosomal membranes (Figure 1A ). Cells starved for 2 hr accumulated on average ∼50 CFP-LC3-labeled autophagic structures with very reproducible kinetics (Figure 1B). This response required Vps34/Beclin Class III PI3 kinase activity–an upstream event in autophagosome formation (Furuya et al., 2005Furuya N. Yu J. Byfield M. Pattingre S. Levine B. The evolutionarily conserved domain of Beclin 1 is required for Vps34 binding, autophagy and tumor suppressor function.Autophagy. 2005; 1: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). NRK58B cells starved in the presence of 10 mM 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an inhibitor of the kinase complex (Petiot et al., 2000Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. Distinct classes of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinases are involved in signaling pathways that control macroautophagy in HT-29 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), failed to recruit CFP-LC3 to punctae. Treated cells showed CFP-LC3 predominately in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Subsequent washout of 3-MA restored the ability to induce autophagy during starvation (Figures 1C and 1D). Starvation induced autophagosomes also showed sequential recruitment of Atg5 (mouse mAtg5) and LC3. Atg5 marks sites of initial autophagosome formation and is necessary for recruitment of LC3 during starvation (Mizushima et al., 2001Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Dissection of autophagosome formation using Apg5-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). We observed rapid accumulation of YFP-Atg5, followed by abrupt loss at punctae (Figure 1E; Movie S1 available online). YFP-Atg5 persisted for ∼3 min, and release always occurred concurrently with accumulation of CFP-LC3 (Figures 1E and 1F). We charted the intracellular locations of YFP-Atg5 and found that autophagosome assembly occurs at sites dispersed throughout the cell (Figure 1G). Autophagosomes generated by starvation captured cytosolic components. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), an autophagy substrate (Hoyvik et al., 1991Hoyvik H. Gordon P.B. Berg T.O. Stromhaug P.E. Seglen P.O. Inhibition of autophagic-lysosomal delivery and autophagic lactolysis by asparagine.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Sneve et al., 2005Sneve M.L. Overbye A. Fengsrud M. Seglen P.O. Comigration of two autophagosome-associated dehydrogenases on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels.Autophagy. 2005; 1: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), was expressed in nutrient-deprived NRK58B cells. Signal from freely diffusing GAPDH-YFP molecules was depleted by repetitively photobleaching a small region of cytosol to reveal non-diffusing subpopulations of GAPDH-YFP in punctae. These co-localized with lysosomal markers (not shown) or CFP-LC3 (Figure 1H), indicating autophagosomes with trapped cytosolic substrate. Autophagosomes in starved NRK58B were further characterized by LysoTracker labeling to visualize fusion between lysosomes and autophagosomes. Upon fusion, LysoTracker signal accumulated in CFP-LC3-labeled autophagosomes. Soon thereafter, CFP-LC3 signal from these structures was lost (Figure 2A ; Movie S2). The lifetime of starvation-induced autophagosomes was examined using photoactivatable GFP (PAGFP) (Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. A photoactivatable GFP for selective photolabeling of proteins and cells.Science. 2002; 297: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar), which is invisible until activated by ∼400-nm irrradiation. PAGFP-LC3 can be used to pulse-label and monitor an autophagosome population (Hailey and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2009Hailey D.W. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Using photoactivatable proteins to monitor autophagysome lifetime.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452: 25-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). NRK cells expressing PAGFP-LC3 were starved, photoactivated, and monitored by live cell imaging. Starvation-induced autophagosomes exhibited near complete turnover within 40 min. Loss of PAGFP-LC3 signal was not due to photobleaching or release of PAGFP-LC3 from autophagosomes prior to lysosomal fusion, since loss of signal was blocked by treatment with chloroquine to inactivate lysosomal proteases and block fusion with lysosomes (Figures 2B and 2C; Movie S3) (Bjorkoy et al., 2005Bjorkoy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. p62/SQSTM1 forms protein aggregates degraded by autophagy and has a protective effect on huntingtin-induced cell death.J.

Methods for assessing autophagy and autophagic cell death.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 445: 29-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Together these data indicate that starvation-induced autophagosomes in NRK58B cells are bona fide autophagosomes. They require Class III PI3Kinase activity and exhibit subsequent Atg5 and LC3 recruitment. These autophagosomes assemble at sites scattered throughout the cell, capture cytosolic substrates, and rapidly turn over in a lysosomal dependent fashion. To identify membranes contributing to autophagosome formation, a battery of YFP-fusion proteins targeted to different intracellular organelles were expressed in NRK58B cells. We reasoned that if the membrane of an organelle was utilized for autophagosome formation, chimeric markers targeted to this membrane might be transferred to the induced autophagosomes. Markers tested included those for the Golgi apparatus, TGN, early endosomal system, plasma membrane, ER, and mitochondria. Tested ER markers included YFP fused to the targeting sequence of ER cytochrome b5, called YFP-ERcb5TM. The targeting sequence of an isoform of cytochrome b5 (cb5) that labels the outer mitochondrial membrane tagged with YFP, called YFP-Mitocb5TM was used to label mitochondria. This cb5 isoform has a shorter transmembrane region and positively charged residues at its distal C terminus than the cb5 isoform targeted to the ER–differences necessary and sufficient to target it specifically to the mitochondria outer membrane (Borgese et al., 2001Borgese N. Gazzoni I. Barberi M. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Targeting of a tail-anchored protein to endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial outer membrane by independent but competing pathways.Mol. Biol.

Biochem. 1983; 132: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). YFP fusions to ERcb5TM and Mitocb5TM co-localized uniquely with ER and mitochondrial markers respectively. There was no YFP-ERcb5TM signal in mitochondrial membranes, and no YFP-Mitocb5TM signal in ER membranes (Figure S1). Most surveyed organelles revealed little or no overlap with CFP-LC3-positive autophagosomes (Figures 3A and 3B ). For ER markers including YFP-ERcb5TM, regions of low ER density showed no overlap with CFP-LC3 (Figure 3A, insets). Because the ER is continuous, we also used repetitive photobleaching of a small region to deplete signal from the entire ER network. Following bleaching, these ER markers were not detected in starvation-induced autophagosomes, suggesting no transfer of ER markers to autophagosomes had taken place. (Figure S2).Figure 3Evaluating Membrane-Targeted Markers for Transfer to AutophagosomesShow full caption(A) Expression of YFP-tagged membrane markers in starved NRK58B cells.

To further evaluate potential transfer of the ER marker to autophagosomes, the ER network was bleached. Because the ER network is continuous, repetative photobleaching part of the ER (yellow box above) depletes signal throughout the entire ER network. No signal was retained in autophagosomes following photobleaching, indicating no ER marker was present on autophagosomes.

If the ER marker was present on membranes of mature autophagosomes separated from the ER network, they would retain signal if they were outside the bleached region. The scale bar represents 5 μm. Only the YFP-Mitocb5TM mitochondrial outer membrane marker showed extensive overlap with autophagosomes. YFP-Mitocb5TM was present on nearly 80% of CFP-LC3 positive autophagosomes after a 2 hr starvation (Figures 3A and 3B). Notably, this observation was specific to starvation-induced autophagy. YFP-Mitocb5TM did not colocalize with autophagosomes formed in response to ER stress and calcium perturbation (Figure S3). YFP-Mitocb5TM stably associated with autophagic membranes. Photobleaching YFP-Mitocb5TM signal was used to deplete all signal except that present on isolated autophagic vesicles. YFP-Mitocb5TM showed persistent signal on these isolated autophagosomes for > 3 min (Figure 3C). We next asked whether overlap of YFP-Mitocb5TM mitochondrial outer membrane marker with the autophagic marker was due to induction of mitophagy, a process wherein mitochondria are captured and degraded (Mijaljica et al., 2007Mijaljica D. Prescott M. Devenish R.J. Different fates of mitochondria: alternative ways for degradation?.Autophagy. 2007; 3: 4-9PubMed Google Scholar). This predicts more overlap of matrix and inner membrane mitochondrial markers with CFP-LC3 positive structures compared to an outer mitochondrial marker. We thus evaluated co-localization of mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane markers with CFP-LC3 after autophagic induction. Mitochondrial matrix was labeled with yellow fluorescent protein fused to the targeting sequence of cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII. Inner membrane was labeled with 10N-nonyl acridine orange (a dye that binds cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Petit et al., 1992Petit J.M. Maftah A. Ratinaud M.H. Julien R. 10N-nonyl acridine orange interacts with cardiolipin and allows the quantification of this phospholipid in isolated mitochondria.Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Neither marker showed a comparable degree of overlap with the autophagosomal marker after starvation (Figures 4A and 4B ). Similarly, the inner membrane marker Prohibitin-YFP showed dramatically less autophagosome-associated signal (Figure 4B). Contrary to what mitophagy predicts, matrix and inner mitochondrial markers did not overlap with CFP-LC3-positive structures induced by starvation. Mitophagy also predicts mitochondrial components should be captured inside autophagosomes. To test this, we examined autophagosomes in cells expressing YFP-Mitocb5TM and GAPDH-RFP. High-resolution imaging resolved isolation membranes of autophagosomes around sequestered GAPDH-RFP signal (Figure 4C). Line profiles of GAPDH-RFP within autophagosomes exhibited single bell-shaped intensity profiles, consistent with soluble protein trapped in the lumen of the autophagosomes. By contrast, YFP-Mitocb5TM showed well-delineated intensity peaks at the limiting membranes of autophagic vesicles (Figure 4D). This indicated that YFP-Mitocb5TM in autophagosomes was present on limiting membranes of autophagosomes, and that the autophagosome lumens contained cytosolic components, not mitochondria. Finally, we compared starvation with conditions known to induce mitophagy. Mitophagy can be induced by staurosporine/ Z-VAD-FMK treatment to simultaneously damage mitochondria and inhibit pan-caspase activity (Colell et al., 2007Colell A. Ricci J.E. Tait S. Milasta S. Maurer U. Bouchier-Hayes L. Fitzgerald P. Guio-Carrion A. Waterhouse N.J. Li C.W. et al.GAPDH and autophagy preserve survival after apoptotic cytochrome c release in the absence of caspase activation.Cell. 2007; 129: 983-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In these conditions, flow cytometry revealed loss of mitochondrial mass in a significant fraction of treated cells. Additionally, we observed autophagosomes in treated NRK58B cells that captured both mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane. Starvation, in contrast, produced neither appreciable loss of mitochondrial mass nor apparent capture of entire mitochondria (Figure 4; Figure S4). We concluded that mitophagy does not underlie the presence of YFP-Mitocb5TM in autophagosomal membranes during starvation in our system. We next considered other scenarios that could result in overlap of the mitochondrial outer membrane marker with the autophagosome marker. One possibility is that mitochondrial outer membrane is used in autophagosome biogenesis. We asked if we could visualize outgrowth of autophagosomes from mitochondria. Starved NRK cells expressing GFP-LC3 and Mito-RFP revealed GFP-LC3 punctae that first formed in association with mitochondria and retained that association despite highly dynamic mitochondrial movements (Figure 5A ; Movie S4). Another autophagosome marker GFP-Atg5 showed similar behavior. Membrane association of the Atg5/Atg12/Atg16 complex is a prerequisite for LC3 recruitment to membranes (Mizushima et al., 2001Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K.

In starved NRK cells, GFP-Atg5 punctae first appeared along mitochondrial elements and persisted along these elements through their lifetime (Figure S5, Figure S6; Movie S5).Figure S5Live-Cell Imaging of GFP-LC3-Labeled Autophagosomes and Associated Mitochondrial Elements, Related to Figure 5Show full captionNRK cells were transfected with the mitochondria matrix marker Mito-RFP and autophagosome marker GFP-Atg5 and subsequently starved.

https://openalex.org/W2008878539,"Melanomas are highly heterogeneous tumors, but the biological significance of their different subpopulations is not clear. Using the H3K4 demethylase JARID1B (KDM5B/PLU-1/RBP2-H1) as a biomarker, we have characterized a small subpopulation of slow-cycling melanoma cells that cycle with doubling times of >4 weeks within the rapidly proliferating main population. Isolated JARID1B-positive melanoma cells give rise to a highly proliferative progeny. Knockdown of JARID1B leads to an initial acceleration of tumor growth followed by exhaustion which suggests that the JARID1B-positive subpopulation is essential for continuous tumor growth. Expression of JARID1B is dynamically regulated and does not follow a hierarchical cancer stem cell model because JARID1B-negative cells can become positive and even single melanoma cells irrespective of selection are tumorigenic. These results suggest a new understanding of melanoma heterogeneity with tumor maintenance as a dynamic process mediated by a temporarily distinct subpopulation."

Much of our knowledge is based on ensemble measurements.

Here, we discuss examples of when heterogeneity cannot be ignored and describe practical strategies for analyzing and interpreting cellular heterogeneity. A central challenge of biology is to understand how individual cells process information and respond to perturbations. Much of our knowledge is based on ensemble measurements. However, cell-to-cell differences are always present to some degree in any cell population, and the ensemble behaviors of a population may not represent the behaviors of any individual cell. Here, we discuss examples of when heterogeneity cannot be ignored and describe practical strategies for analyzing and interpreting cellular heterogeneity. After decades of probing, measuring, and analyzing the behaviors of single cells, it has become clear that the challenge is no longer to demonstrate that populations of “seemingly identical” cells are heterogeneous. Indeed, phenotypic differences among cells are always present at a fine-enough resolution of inspection. Rather, the daunting challenge is to determine which, if any, components of observed cellular heterogeneity serve a biological function or contain meaningful information. Population-averaged assays are powerful tools in biology, enabling the identification of components and interactions within complex metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional networks. (Population-averages can refer to experimental measurements derived from assays that pool analytes from large numbers of cells or to mathematical averages taken over distributions of single-cell measurements.) Such measurements can succinctly capture population state and readily report how these states change in response to perturbations. An assumption is that ensemble averages reflect the dominant biological mechanism operating within individual cells in a population. Although ensemble measurements may be too simplistic, capturing all variation among cells also may be unnecessary. To develop accurate models of individual cell behavior—be they in the form of cartoons, words, or mathematics—it is essential to identify which cell-to-cell differences are important and which can be ignored. What about cells away from the mean (Figure 1Ai )? The behavior of such cells may be similar to that of the average behavior of the population, and observed variation may be summarized by a mean (and perhaps a variance) with no loss of meaningful biological information. Cell-to-cell differences, for example those due to biochemical noise (Elowitz et al., 2002Elowitz M.B. Levine A.J. Siggia E.D. Swain P.S. Science. 2002; 297: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3546) Google Scholar, Newman et al., 2006Newman J.R. Ghaemmaghami S. Ihmels J. Breslow D.K. Noble M. DeRisi J.L. Weissman J.S.

Science. 2004; 304: 1811-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), may have no functional significance. So-called “housekeeping” genes are often chosen as references in assays under the assumption that their variation in expression is small and biologically unimportant (although such assumptions are increasingly challenged; for example, see Bahar et al., 2006Bahar R. Hartmann C.H. Rodriguez K.A. Denny A.D. Busuttil R.A. Dolle M.E. Calder R.B. Chisholm G.B. Pollock B.H. Klein C.A. et al.Nature. 2006; 441: 1011-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). As a more specific example, subpopulations of R1-R6 photoreceptor cells in the compound eye of the fruit fly Drosophila are considered functionally equivalent with respect to their response and adaptation to light signals (Yau and Hardie, 2009Yau K.W. Hardie R.C. Cell. 2009; 139: 246-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, cell-to-cell differences can have functional consequences, such as seen for cell fate decisions in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis and selection of color vision photoreceptors in Drosophila (Losick and Desplan, 2008Losick R. Desplan C. Science. 2008; 320: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Recently, subpopulations of clonally derived hematopoietic progenitor cells with low or high expression of the stem cell marker Sca-1 were observed to be in dramatically different transcriptional states and to give rise to different blood cell lineages (Chang et al., 2008Chang H.H. Hemberg M. Barahona M. Ingber D.E. Huang S. Nature. 2008; 453: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Therefore, models derived from ensemble averages may not represent individual cell function even for a simple bell-shaped distribution of single-cell measurements. Population distributions can also mask the presence of rare or small subpopulations of cells (Figure 1Aii). In such a case, a population mean may represent the vast majority of cells yet miss important biology. Recent studies have investigated the presence and dynamics of small subpopulations within genetically identical populations of bacteria. These include the identification of pre-existing subpopulations of slow-growing “persister cells” that have a negligible effect on fitness under normal conditions but enable survival in response to drug treatment (Balaban et al., 2004Balaban N.Q. Merrin J. Chait R. Kowalik L. Leibler S. Science. 2004; 305: 1622-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). In other studies, variability in the duration of a transiently differentiated state may increase fitness in fluctuating environments (Cagatay et al., 2009Cagatay T. Turcotte M. Elowitz M.B. Garcia-Ojalvo J. Suel G.M. Cell. 2009; 139: 512-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Similarly, small reservoirs of dormant stem cells have been identified within larger hematopoietic stem cell populations. The rapid reactivation of these subpopulations during times of injury plays a crucial role in re-establishment of homeostasis (Wilson et al., 2008Wilson A. Laurenti E. Oser G. van der Wath R.C. Blanco-Bose W. Jaworski M. Offner S. Dunant C.F. Eshkind L. Bockamp E. et al.Cell. 2008; 135: 1118-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Finally, cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease (Heppner, 1984Heppner G.H. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2259-2265PubMed Google Scholar, Rubin, 1990Rubin H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The origins of subpopulations that contribute unequally to disease progression or response to therapeutic intervention are the subject of debate. However, heterogeneity poses practical challenges for building accurate clinical models, particularly ones based on population-averaged measurements, to guide diagnosis and treatment of the disease (Campbell and Polyak, 2007Campbell L.L. Polyak K. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2332-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Even within clonal populations under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, the dynamics and responses of single cancer cells to drugs can vary widely (Cohen et al., 2008Cohen A.A. Geva-Zatorsky N. Eden E. Frenkel-Morgenstern M. Issaeva I. Sigal A. Milo R. Cohen-Saidon C. Liron Y. Kam Z. et al.Science. 2008; 322: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008Gascoigne K.E. Taylor S.S. Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), and drug-tolerant states can arise transiently through reversible epigenetic changes (Sharma et al., 2010Sharma S.V. Lee D.Y. Li B. Quinlan M.P. Takahashi F. Maheswaran S. McDermott U. Azizian N. Zou L. Fischbach M.A. et al.Cell. 2010; 141: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). An even more problematic situation is when the ensemble-averaged measurement poorly reflects the internal states of the majority of the cells, any subpopulation of cells, or even any single cell (Figure 1Aiii). This can occur, for example, when the population contains several dominant, yet phenotypically distinct subpopulations. This situation is observed for populations of immature Xenopus oocytes (Ferrell and Machleder, 1998Ferrell Jr., J.E. Machleder E.M. Science. 1998; 280: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Ensemble averages suggest that a graded input of the maturation-inducing hormone progesterone is converted to a graded signaling output, in this case phosphorylation of the downstream readout p42 MAP kinase. Physical models based on these measurements would predict that the “average” oocyte would exhibit an intermediate level of commitment for an intermediate level of progesterone stimulation. However, for individual oocytes, commitment is an all-or-nothing response. That is, the population comprises two nonoverlapping subpopulations—committed and noncommitted—with no oocytes at intermediate levels of commitment. Thus, when populations are mixtures of distinct subpopulations, the biological models of relevance are mechanisms operating within each subpopulation. Signaling networks, even for narrowly defined biological functions, can be complex, and constructing accurate models may require monitoring multiple components (Sachs et al., 2005Sachs K. Perez O. Pe'er D. Lauffenburger D.A. Nolan G.P. Science. 2005; 308: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). New layers of complexity within heterogeneity may be revealed by simultaneously monitoring multiple readouts per cell (Figure 1Aiv). At the lowest resolution, the state of a population may be approximated by the mean of each readout, such as is routinely performed with western blots or microarrays, though with all of the caveats previously discussed. At an intermediate resolution, the distributions of each readout may be analyzed independently (so-called “univariate” analysis). Though such approaches simplify analysis (Perlman et al., 2004Perlman Z.E. Slack M.D. Feng Y. Mitchison T.J. Wu L.F. Altschuler S.J. Science. 2004; 306: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and may uncover heterogeneity one readout at a time, important relationships among the readouts within individual cells may be missed. At the highest resolution, analysis of all cellular readouts from individual cells simultaneously (so-called “multivariate” analysis) may reveal both heterogeneity and important coupling among the readouts. Consider the case of two readouts, whose population distributions are each bimodal (low or high values). In principle, any cell could have one of four possible combinations of (low/high, low/high) values for these two markers. However, analysis of each marker independently would not distinguish, for example, between correlated and anticorrelated expression of the two readouts within individual cells. By contrast, multivariate analysis of the readouts would identify which of the four potential modes were present within any given population. For example, during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cultured cells, readouts such as production of the hormone adiponectin or lipid droplet expression increase from low to high levels, suggesting that the “average” cell progresses toward an (high, high) internal state (for adiponectin and lipid droplets). However, single-cell studies revealed that cells move from a beginning (low, low) state, to an intermediate (high, low) state, to a final (low, high) state (Loo et al., 2009aLoo L.H. Lin H.J. Singh D.K. Lyons K.M. Altschuler S.J. Wu L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The expected (high, high) cellular state, observed with only small probability, was an illusion of ensemble-averaged measurements. Decomposing heterogeneity was required to develop accurate models of the signaling states in individual adipocytes. Thus, ensemble measurements can provide accurate descriptions of individual cellular behavior when heterogeneity simply reflects functionally meaningless fluctuations around a single cellular state. However, when a population is composed of multiple cellular states, ignoring heterogeneity can lead to models that may be accurate at the level of population trends but do not reflect the signaling states of any individual cell. Hence, the use of ensemble measurements to model individual cells must be justified. Heterogeneity is observed for essentially all dimensions of single-cell measurements at high resolution. Some well-understood dimensions are routinely used to sort populations into mixtures of cells in distinct and meaningful biological states, such as cell-cycle stage or cell type. But what about the multitudes of other dimensions, for which cell-to-cell variation has no obvious or known biological interpretation? In some cases, cellular states can be distinguished by detailed molecular differences. The selection of a specific molecule from a large repertoire of possibilities generates enormous diversity by individual cell variation, such as seen for odorant, cell adhesion, or immune molecules (Coufal et al., 2009Coufal N.G. Garcia-Perez J.L. Peng G.E. Yeo G.W. Mu Y. Lovci M.T. Morell M. O'Shea K.S. Moran J.V. Gage F.H.

USA. 2006; 103: 19719-19724Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In other cases, states can be distinguished by large-scale changes, such as signal transduction responses to hormone stimulation (Ferrell and Machleder, 1998Ferrell Jr., J.E. Machleder E.M. Science. 1998; 280: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), and detailed molecular differences are unimportant, particularly when function is buffered against biochemical fluctuations (Shinar and Feinberg, 2010Shinar G. Feinberg M. Science. 2010; 327: 1389-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A general challenge is to determine which details give rise to biologically meaningful distinctions within and among populations, and which can be ignored (i.e., when an ensemble average is justified). Determining whether observed heterogeneity has functional significance requires a framework for quantifying heterogeneity and assessing its information content. An intuitive and tractable approach is to decompose heterogeneous populations into mixtures of simpler, more homogeneous subpopulations, based on the expectation that cells with relatively similar measured states should behave in a similar way. The biological relevance of such a decomposition could be tested by determining whether different subpopulations, or mixtures of subpopulations, have different functional properties. Decomposition-independent approaches are also possible for testing whether heterogeneity contains information: populations with different overall distributions may exhibit functional differences. For example, mechanisms of drug action can be classified based on comparison of the different distributions of cellular responses that they induce (Perlman et al., 2004Perlman Z.E. Slack M.D. Feng Y. Mitchison T.J. Wu L.F. Altschuler S.J. Science. 2004; 306: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, informative decompositions can provide useful guides for future studies, including further probing of the molecular states of the subpopulations (Loo et al., 2009aLoo L.H. Lin H.J. Singh D.K. Lyons K.M. Altschuler S.J. Wu L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Loo et al., 2009bLoo L.H. Lin H.J. Steininger 3rd, R.J. Wang Y. Wu L.F. Altschuler S.J. Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In general, the investigation of heterogeneity requires a combined approach for capturing population statistics from single-cell measurements, identifying patterns of heterogeneity, and testing whether these patterns contain functional information. Heterogeneity is essentially a statistical property of cellular populations. A distribution of cellular behaviors can be estimated from observations of a small number of cells over a long time, or a large number of cells at a single time point. In theory, these different estimates can give similar information if cells behave ergodically—that is, time-averaged single-cell behaviors and ensemble-averaged population behaviors are equivalent in a probabilistic sense (although the property of ergodicity may be difficult to test rigorously) (Brock et al., 2009Brock A. Chang H. Huang S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In practice, statistical properties of cellular behaviors are often estimated from snapshots of large numbers of cells. Single-cell phenotypes can be captured by many different measurement technologies (Figure 1Bi) (Anselmetti, 2009Anselmetti, 2009 D. Single Cell Analysis: Technologies and Applications. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2009Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), including flow cytometry, electrophysiology, microscopy, and single-cell PCR or sequencing. For some technologies, the choices of cellular features are well defined, whereas for others the choices are less clear. For example, the total intensity of each labeled biomarker is a standard readout in flow cytometry, whereas there is virtually no limit to the number of features that can be extracted in microscopy. The desire to extract all relevant information from single-cell assays may require strategies that balance two, somewhat opposing goals: interpretability and comprehensiveness. Interpretability suggests an intuitive connection between a familiar biological phenotype and the measured values of a feature. Comprehensiveness suggests the ability to capture all important information; large collections of features are measured with the hope that all anticipated (or unanticipated but important) biological variation is captured. In microscopy, strategies striving for interpretability may use expert-selected features, such as cell shape, marker intensity, or marker localization, whereas strategies striving for comprehensiveness may use features derived from general-purpose transformations, such as Haralick texture features or Zernike moments that report large numbers of statistical properties of marker staining patterns (Boland and Murphy, 2001Boland M.V. Murphy R.F. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Of course, not all features are expected to be equally informative and methods (such as principle component analysis) are often applied to eliminate noisy or redundant features and to reduce the dimensionality of feature spaces (Duda et al., 2001Duda R.O. Hart P.E. Stork D.G. Pattern Classification, 2 edn. Wiley-Interscience, New York2001Google Scholar). The collections of extracted features allow an individual cell to be represented as a point in (high-dimensional) “feature” space, with each axis representing a different measurement. Therefore, populations of cells are transformed into distributions (of points) in feature space. The problem of identifying patterns of distinct cellular behaviors in feature space (Figure 2Bii) can be reduced to well-studied, analytical, and computational problems of decomposing heterogeneous distributions, for which extensive methodology exists and is used in diverse applications ranging from gene function prediction to speech and face recognition (Duda et al., 2001Duda R.O. Hart P.E. Stork D.G. Pattern Classification, 2 edn. Wiley-Interscience, New York2001Google Scholar). In supervised approaches, expert knowledge is used to partition the feature space. Approaches range from simple, user-defined thresholds (such as routinely used to separate subpopulations in flow cytometry) to more complex, machine-learning algorithms that iteratively train computers to identify subpopulations based on examples (such as recently developed for high-throughput microscopy screening; Boland and Murphy, 2001Boland M.V. Murphy R.F. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, Jones et al., 2009Jones T.R. Carpenter A.E. Lamprecht M.R. Moffat J. Silver S.J. Grenier J.K.

BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 264Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In unsupervised approaches, computational algorithms partition distributions in naive, or unbiased, manners. Intuitively, methods such as deterministic K-means clustering or probabilistic Gaussian mixture modeling seek to identify local, high-density regions of phenotype space (Figure 1Bii; Pyne et al., 2009Pyne S. Hu X. Wang K. Rossin E. Lin T.I. Maier L.M. Baecher-Allan C. McLachlan G.J. Tamayo P. Hafler D.A. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2008; 105: 19306-19311Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). There are always questions of whether cellular behaviors can be categorized by a finite number of states, and whether a distribution has been partitioned into too few or too many subpopulations. Analytical criteria (Wang et al., 2007Wang M. Zhou X. King R.W. Wong S.T. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or even visual inspection may be used to provide guidelines for such questions. However, the ultimate usefulness of a decomposition is the degree to which it reveals biological information for a given functional readout. One can test whether the behaviors of specific subpopulations are significantly different from each other or from an ensemble average (Figure 1Biii, left). As examples, bacterial subpopulations with different growth rates can have different degrees of resistance to antibiotics (Balaban et al., 2004Balaban N.Q. Merrin J. Chait R. Kowalik L. Leibler S. Science. 2004; 305: 1622-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar), and adherent eukaryotic cell subpopulations with different microenvironmental properties can have different functional behaviors, such as virus infection efficiency and endocytosis activity (Snijder et al., 2009Snijder B. Sacher R. Ramo P. Damm E.M. Liberali P. Pelkmans L. Nature. 2009; 461: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). One can also test whether an entire decomposition of heterogeneity is informative (Figure 1Biii, middle and right). This case is important when individual subpopulations cannot be physically isolated for functional testing, or when the subpopulations interact with one another. As examples, different patterns of heterogeneity for general signaling markers in untreated cancer cell populations were found to predict differences in drug sensitivities (Singh et al., 2010Singh D.K. Ku C.J. Wichaidit C. Steinenger R.J.I. Wu L.F. Altschuler S.J. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; https://doi.org/10.1038/msb.2010.22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and different patterns of heterogeneous signaling responses to drug treatment were used to predict mechanisms of drug action (Slack et al., 2008Slack M.D. Martinez E.D. Wu L.F. Altschuler S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 19306-19311Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Further, different heterogeneous mixtures of isolated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were found to have different levels of activity against tumors, as measured by differences in Interferon-γ secretion (Oved et al., 2009Oved K. Eden E. Akerman M. Noy R. Wolchinsky R. Izhaki O. Schallmach E. Kubi A. Zabari N. Schachter J. et al.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 265Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). An intriguing possibility is that heterogeneity can serve not only as a passive readout of population state but also as a predictor of future responses to perturbations, or even as a property that can be manipulated to affect a desired population output. Of course, it is not to be expected that every decomposition will contain functional information. Presumably, no significant functional differences should be observed when subpopulations are chosen randomly (i.e., ignoring all feature values) or chosen based on features that are uncorrelated with the functional readout. Taken together, the framework described above serves as a starting point for rigorously exploring biological information contained in heterogeneity. Heterogeneity has been classically observed and speculated to be a fundamental property of cellular systems (Elsasser, 1984Elsasser W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1984; 81: 5126-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, Rubin, 1990Rubin H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Notably, heterogeneity provides a mechanism for an organ or organism to increase its range of responses to changing environmental conditions. Although we have focused our discussion on cells, heterogeneity—and the loss of information due to ensemble averages—has been studied at many scales of biology, from single molecules (English et al., 2006English B.P. Min W. van Oijen A.M. Lee K.T. Luo G. Sun H. Cherayil B.J. Kou S.C. Xie X.S. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) to communities of whole populations (Kimura and Weiss, 1964Kimura M. Weiss G.H. Genetics. 1964; 49: 561-576PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have sidestepped the difficult and fascinating problems of identifying the origins of cellular heterogeneity (Brock et al., 2009Brock A. Chang H. Huang S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, Muotri et al., 2005Muotri A.R. Chu V.T. Marchetto M.C. Deng W. Moran J.V. Gage F.H.

Nature. 2009; 459: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), or understanding its differences in vivo and in vitro or in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Rather, we have focused on the general challenge of characterizing and interpreting information contained within heterogeneity. Although well-characterized biological systems may present ready choices for connecting heterogeneity and function, heterogeneity is often observed in experimental settings for which there are no immediate, a priori clues to its meaning or functional relevance. Interpreting heterogeneity is not solely an analytical challenge of fitting complex, multidimensional distributions, as even simple distributions (e.g., observed for the marker Sca-1) can contain subpopulations enriched for biologically distinct functions. Beyond studies of single subpopulations, properties of heterogeneity (e.g., the proportions of subpopulations within an overall population) may serve as informative readouts of population physiology and predictors of responses to perturbations. The ability to transform heterogeneity into a tractable, computable, and bone fide property of cellular populations provides a rigorous starting point for determining which variation is random and which is meaningful, and for building better models of the behaviors of individual cells."

Here, we demonstrate that levels of the miR-183/96/182 cluster, miR-204, and miR-211 are regulated by different light levels in the mouse retina. Concentrations of these microRNAs were downregulated during dark adaptation and upregulated in light-adapted retinas, with rapid decay and increased transcription being responsible for the respective changes. We identified the voltage-dependent glutamate transporter Slc1a1 as one of the miR-183/96/182 targets in photoreceptor cells. We found that microRNAs in retinal neurons decay much faster than microRNAs in nonneuronal cells. The high turnover is also characteristic of microRNAs in hippocampal and cortical neurons, and neurons differentiated from ES cells in vitro. Blocking activity reduced turnover of microRNAs in neuronal cells while stimulation with glutamate accelerated it. Our results demonstrate that microRNA metabolism in neurons is higher than in most other cells types and linked to neuronal activity."

Here we show that detection and processing of fear-evoking odors emitted from cat, rat, and snake require the function of sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ. To investigate the molecular nature of the sensory cues emitted by predators, we isolated the salient ligands from two species using a combination of innate behavioral assays in naive receiving animals, calcium imaging, and c-Fos induction. Surprisingly, the defensive behavior-promoting activity released by other animals is encoded by species-specific ligands belonging to the major urinary protein (Mup) family, homologs of aggression-promoting mouse pheromones. We show that recombinant Mup proteins are sufficient to activate sensory neurons and initiate defensive behavior similarly to native odors.

Here, we present a stepwise guidance protocol starting with mouse embryonic stem and induced pluripotent stem cells, which were directed toward becoming ectoderm capable of responding to otic-inducing growth factors. The resulting otic progenitor cells were subjected to varying differentiation conditions, one of which promoted the organization of the cells into epithelial clusters displaying hair cell-like cells with stereociliary bundles. Bundle-bearing cells in these clusters responded to mechanical stimulation with currents that were reminiscent of immature hair cell transduction currents.

ESCs and iPSCs can be guided along the otic lineage In vitro-differentiated cells display typical hair cell cytomorphology Mechanical responses are reminiscent of hair cell transduction currents Our inner ear harbors about 15,000 cochlear and about the same number of vestibular sensory hair cells, which are the mechanoreceptors of our senses of hearing and balance. Because of their paucity, molecular studies on hair cells have been limited, and, consequently, the inner ear shelters the last of our senses for which the molecular basis is unknown. Aside from being scarce, hair cells are also sensitive to mechanical and chemical insults. Acoustical overstimulation, chemotherapy, aminoglycoside drug side effects, the effects of aging, and increasingly noisy environments contribute to the deterioration of hearing over time. As a result, hundreds of millions of patients worldwide are permanently debilitated by hearing loss and balance problems. The main reason for the permanence of these chronic disorders is the fact that mammalian cochlear hair cells do not spontaneously regenerate and that the limited regeneration observed in the vestibular system is inadequate to restore function (Forge et al., 1993Forge A.

Probably the most suitable renewable source for the generation of sensory hair cells are pluripotent stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Beisel et al., 2008Beisel K.

Whereas detailed and efficient protocols for the stepwise differentiation of retinal photoreceptors exist (Ikeda et al., 2005Ikeda H. Osakada F. Watanabe K. Mizuseki K. Haraguchi T. Miyoshi H.

Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), only a single labor-intensive and protracted protocol has been devised for the generation of hair cell-like cells from mouse ESCs (Li et al., 2003Li H. Roblin G. Liu H. Heller S. Generation of hair cells by stepwise differentiation of embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13495-13500Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In all of these previous approaches, stem cell-generated retinal photoreceptor and hair cell-like cells were mainly defined by the expression of multiple marker proteins. However, a recent report shows that transplanted ESC-derived retinal cells restored light responses in a blind mouse model, indicating that the stem cell-generated photoreceptors can be functional when the progenitor cells are maturing in an enabling environment (Lamba et al., 2009Lamba D.A. Gust J. Reh T.A.

The main goal of our study was to employ principles of early embryonic development and otic induction to generate a population of otic progenitor cells capable of differentiating into mechanosensitive sensory hair cells in vitro. ESCs and iPSCs isolated from an identical murine model were used in parallel to show that both pluripotent cell types differentiate along the otic lineage without major differences. We searched for conditions that promoted the differentiation of otic progenitors into hair cell-like cells that expressed a battery of marker genes and displayed protrusions that are highly reminiscent of stereociliary hair bundles. Finally, we were able to show that ESC- and iPSC-generated hair cell-like cells were responsive to mechanical stimulation and that these responses displayed transduction currents and adaptation reminiscent of immature hair cells. The transgenic mouse strain Math1/nGFP expresses a nuclear variant of enhanced green fluorescent protein (nGFP) that is driven by an Atoh1 enhancer (Lumpkin et al., 2003Lumpkin E.A. Collisson T. Parab P. Omer-Abdalla A. Haeberle H. Chen P. Doetzlhofer A. White P. Groves A. Segil N. Johnson J.E. Math1-driven GFP expression in the developing nervous system of transgenic mice.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2003; 3: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All sensory hair cells of the Math1/nGFP inner ear express nGFP from the time when they differentiate into nascent hair cells until adulthood (Figures S1A and S1B available online), which makes stem cells isolated from this mouse line useful for guidance studies because stem cell-derived hair cell-like cells can be identified by nGFP expression (Diensthuber et al., 2009Diensthuber M.

From Math1/nGFP blastocysts, we isolated four lines of ESCs that expressed typical ESC markers and displayed ESC colony morphology when grown on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeders in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Figures S1C–S1G). Interestingly, all four Math1/nGFP ESC lines expressed the nGFP reporter, which was not unexpected because Math1 expression has been previously reported in ESCs (Azuara et al., 2006Azuara V. Perry P. Sauer S. Spivakov M. Jørgensen H.F. John R.M. Gouti M. Casanova M. Warnes G. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Chromatin signatures of pluripotent cell lines.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). To generate iPSC lines, we infected Math1/nGFP embryonic fibroblasts with retroviruses expressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Primary colonies were picked, subcloned, and expanded on MEF feeder cells (Figure S2A). The iPSC lines expressed typical ESC marker genes as well as the Math1/nGFP reporter (Figures S2B and S2C). We randomly differentiated ESC and iPSC lines by generation of embryoid bodies, removal of LIF, and culturing the embryoid body cells before analyzing expression of endo-, meso-, and ectodermal markers. We found upregulation of transcripts for GATA6, Brachyury, and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which was confirmed by immunocytochemistry (Figures S3A–S3F ). In differentiated cell populations, expression of the nGFP reporter was reduced or absent, and cells that expressed germline-specific markers were consistently nGFP negative. This observation indicates that the Math1/nGFP reporter is active in ESCs and iPSCs and downregulated upon differentiation of the cells. When ESC and iPSC lines were injected subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice, we found formation of typical teratomas. The teratomas consisted of tissues that could be assigned to all three germ layers, indicative of the pluripotency of the ESC and iPSC lines (Figure S4).Figure S4Histology of Teratomas Formed after Injection of C9 ES Cells and Three iPS Cell Lines (#24, #25-5 and #36) into Immunodeficient SCID Mice, Related to Figure 1Show full caption2-4 mice per cell line were injected and all mice investigated developed teratomas within 4 weeks of injection.

It has been hypothesized that inhibition of primitive streak cell identities during embryoid body formation will suppress the induction of endo- and mesoderm from uncommitted epiblast cells. Establishment of primitive streak cells upon differentiation of ESCs depends on the presence of active Wnt and TGF-β/nodal/activin signaling, which recapitulates early events that lead to germ-layer induction in the mammalian embryo (Gadue et al., 2006Gadue P. Huber T.L. Paddison P.J. Keller G.M. Wnt and TGF-beta signaling are required for the induction of an in vitro model of primitive streak formation using embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 16806-16811Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We anticipated that interference with Wnt and TGF-β signaling would strongly suppress the formation of primitive streak cells and concomitantly increase presumptive ectoderm. In addition, we presumed that activation of IGF signaling would promote the formation of anterior ectoderm (Pera et al., 2001Pera E.M. Wessely O. Li S.Y. De Robertis E.M. Neural and head induction by insulin-like growth factor signals.Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), which is more competent to otic induction than trunk ectoderm (Groves and Bronner-Fraser, 2000Groves A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Competence, specification and commitment in otic placode induction.Development. 2000; 127: 3489-3499PubMed Google Scholar). Similar strategies were used to generate ectoderm that is capable of differentiating into retinal cell types (Ikeda et al., 2005Ikeda H. Osakada F. Watanabe K. Mizuseki K. Haraguchi T. Miyoshi H. Kamiya D. Honda Y. Sasai N. Yoshimura N. et al.Generation of Rx+/Pax6+ neural retinal precursors from embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Toward the generation of rod and cone photoreceptors from mouse, monkey and human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Embryoid bodies, generated from ESCs and iPSCs, were treated with the Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 (Glinka et al., 1998Glinka A. Wu W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Dickkopf-1 is a member of a new family of secreted proteins and functions in head induction.Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), the selective inhibitor of Smad3 (SIS3) that interferes with TGF-β signaling (Jinnin et al., 2006Jinnin M. Ihn H. Tamaki K. Characterization of SIS3, a novel specific inhibitor of Smad3, and its effect on transforming growth factor-beta1-induced extracellular matrix expression.Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and IGF-1, either alone or in combinations (Figure 1A ). Embryoid body-derived cells were attached to culture dishes and stained with antibodies to Brachyury and GATA6, indicators of differentiation along the meso- and endodermal lineages, respectively. We observed that treatment of ESC-derived embryoid bodies with either Dkk1 or SIS3 alone significantly reduced the number of Brachyury-positive cells (Figure 1B). For iPSC-derived embryoid bodies, only Dkk1 alone was able to significantly reduce the Brachyury-expressing cell population (Figure 1C). Combination of Dkk1 and SIS3 significantly reduced the number of Brachyury-positive cells from 65.0% ± 14.9% to 20.9% ± 6.9% in ESC-derived populations and from 44.1% ± 9.6% to 15.3% ± 6.5% in iPSC-derived populations (Figures 1B and 1C). These two factors also led to significant reduction of the GATA6-positive cell population from 24.9% ± 3.1% to 10.1% ± 3.7% (ESC derivatives) and from 34.3% ± 7.1% to 13.9% ± 8.4% (iPSC derivatives). Combination of Dkk1, SIS3, and IGF-1 (D/S/I) was most effective, leading to a reduction of Brachyury-positive cells to 20.8% ± 13.1% and of the GATA6-expressing cell population to 9.8% ± 5.0% in ESC-derived cell populations (Figures 1B and 1D). Likewise, iPSC-derivatives displayed reduction to 14.3% ± 5.8% (Brachyury) and 12.1% ± 6.8% (GATA6) (Figures 1C and 1E). The reduction of Brachyury and GATA6 expression was also detectable at the transcript level, where the mRNA for the ESC marker Nanog was also reduced most in D/S/I-treated cultures (Figures 1F and 1G). To test for competence to otic induction, we plated the D/S/I-treated embryoid bodies into gelatin-coated culture dishes and exposed them to FGFs, which have been shown to be both sufficient and necessary for otic induction (Freter et al., 2008Freter S.

We used bFGF as a general otic inducer because it activates several different FGF receptor subtypes and has been previously used to substitute for the proposed natural otic-inducing FGF3 and FGF10 (Groves and Bronner-Fraser, 2000Groves A.K.

Fgf3 and Fgf10 are required for mouse otic placode induction.Development. 2003; 130: 3379-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). As a marker for otic induction, we used antibodies to Pax2 (Li et al., 2004Li H. Liu H. Corrales C.E. Mutai H. Heller S. Correlation of Pax-2 expression with cell proliferation in the developing chicken inner ear.J. Neurobiol. 2004; 60: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and we quantified the number of Pax2-positive cells after 3 day treatment with bFGF (Figure 2A ). In both ESC- and iPSC-derived populations, we observed the largest increase of Pax2-positive cells in cultures that were previously exposed to D/S/I, reaching 29.8% ± 7.1% for ESC derivatives and 19.6% ± 5.6% for iPSC derivatives (Figures 2B–2E). Comparable results were obtained when we used FGF3 and FGF10 instead of bFGF, which resulted in 24.6% ± 4.0% Pax2-positive cells for ESC derivatives and 16.3% ± 4.0% for iPSC derivatives (n = 3). Neither the initial factors alone nor combinations of two factors were as effective as the triple combination; therefore all three factors/compounds are needed to generate a cell population that is most responsive to FGF treatment. Dkk1 and SIS3 are mainly effective in suppressing endo- and mesodermal lineages, whereas the effect of IGF-1 only became obvious after FGF induction, where D/S/I-treatment resulted in an increased number of Pax2-positive cells when compared with D/S treatment (p values [paired t test] for these experiments were 0.04 for ESC-derived cells and 0.1 for iPSC-derived cells indicative of significance in case of ESC-derived cells and a possible trend for iPSC-derived cells) (Figures 2B and 2C). Control cultures not treated with any of the three initial factors, but treated with bFGF, displayed only a few Pax2-expressing cells (0.05 ± 0.04% for ESC and 0.1 ± 0.09% for iPSC derivatives). RT-PCR confirmed the strong upregulation of Pax2 in ESC and iPSC cultures after D/S/I treatment and exposure to bFGF (Figures 2F and 2G). Transcripts for other genes that are expressed in the developing inner ear, such as Pax8, Dlx5, Six1, and Eya1 (Brown et al., 2005Brown S.T. Wang J. Groves A.K.

Double immunostaining revealed that 56.0% ± 5.3% of the Pax2-positive cells in ESC-derived cultures coexpressed the otic marker Dlx5 (Figure 2H). Conversely, 73.2% ± 10.3% of Dlx5-positive cells coexpressed Pax2. In the native developing inner ear, Pax2 expression precedes Dlx5 expression (Brown et al., 2005Brown S.T. Wang J. Groves A.K. Dlx gene expression during chick inner ear development.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 483: 48-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and it is therefore not surprising to find only partial coexpression. Likewise, 64.1% ± 5.6% of Pax2-expressing cells colabeled with antibody to Pax8 (Figure 2I); 43.0% ± 8.3% of Pax8-positive cells coexpressed Pax2. Pax8 is induced prior to Pax2 in the native developing inner ear (Hans et al., 2004Hans S. Liu D. Westerfield M.

Genet. 1999; 24: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and well before Dlx5; therefore, we did not expect to detect complete coexpression of these markers because their temporal expression periods during native otic development do not completely overlap. Pax2 is not an inner ear-specific marker. For example, it is also expressed in neural progenitors in close vicinity to the otic vesicle at the midbrain/hindbrain boundary, where it is coexpressed with engrailed 1 (Rowitch and McMahon, 1995Rowitch D.H. McMahon A.P. Pax-2 expression in the murine neural plate precedes and encompasses the expression domains of Wnt-1 and En-1.Mech. Dev. 1995; 52: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (Figure S5A). Engrailed 1, however, is not associated with Pax2-expressing otic progenitor cells in the developing otic vesicle (Figures S5A and S5B). D/S/I+bFGF treatment only resulted in 1.2% ± 0.8% of engrailed 1-positive cells, which all expressed Pax2, indicating that the vast majority of Pax2-positive cells were not midbrain/hindbrain boundary neural progenitors. Our guidance strategy utilizes similar steps as retinal cell guidance protocols (Ikeda et al., 2005Ikeda H. Osakada F. Watanabe K. Mizuseki K. Haraguchi T. Miyoshi H. Kamiya D. Honda Y. Sasai N. Yoshimura N. et al.Generation of Rx+/Pax6+ neural retinal precursors from embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Toward the generation of rod and cone photoreceptors from mouse, monkey and human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). As a result, we would expect to find retinal progenitors in ESC- and iPSC-derived cultures. Indeed, Pax6-expressing cells were detectable in D/S/I+bFGF-treated cultures and were clearly distinct from the Pax2-positive cell population (Figure S5C). Native otic induction is blocked by inhibition of FGF signaling (Alsina et al., 2004Alsina B. Abelló G. Ulloa E. Henrique D. Pujades C. Giraldez F. FGF signaling is required for determination of otic neuroblasts in the chick embryo.Dev. Biol. 2004; 267: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Martin and Groves, 2006Martin K. Groves A.K. Competence of cranial ectoderm to respond to Fgf signaling suggests a two-step model of otic placode induction.Development. 2006; 133: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Blockade of FGF signaling with the FGF receptor inhibitor SU5402 resulted in abolishment of Pax2 induction (Figure 2J), which shows that also in guidance experiments, FGF signaling is essential for otic induction from presumptive ectodermal cells. Overall, the strong upregulation and coexpression of multiple early inner ear markers suggests that D/S/I followed by bFGF treatment sufficiently mimics, in a culture dish, the events leading to otic induction during normal embryonic development. Withdrawal of growth factors and serum-free culture on gelatin is an effective way to initiate differentiation of ESC-generated otic progenitors (Li et al., 2003Li H. Roblin G. Liu H. Heller S. Generation of hair cells by stepwise differentiation of embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13495-13500Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This approach led to upregulation of hair cell markers, but in culture, the generated hair cell-like cells did not adopt typical hair cell morphology. We tested four different substrates for differentiation of ESC- and iPSC-generated otic progenitors, generated by D/S/I+bFGF treatment. When ESC- and iPSC-derived cells were plated onto fibronectin, gelatin, or MEF feeders, we detected nGFP-positive cells (Figures 3A and 3B ). Per 104 plated cells, 955 ± 153, 857 ± 240, and 520 ± 95 nGFP-positive cells were found in ESC-derived cultures, as well as 670 ± 110, 597 ± 170, and 360 ± 66 nGFP-positive cells in iPSC-derived cultures (on fibronectin, gelatin, and MEFs, respectively; n = 3). A subpopulation of the nGFP-positive cells was immunopositive for the hair cell marker myosin VIIa: 37 ± 5, 12 ± 8, and 33 ± 12 (ESC derived) and 24 ± 6, 8 ± 5, 25 ± 6 (iPSC derived).

When we plated the ESC- and iPSC-derived otic progenitors onto a layer of mitotically inactivated chicken utricle stromal cells, we observed a different behavior. The progenitors formed defined patches of cells that harbored nGFP-positive cells, which coexpressed the hair cell marker myosin VIIa and the actin filament-bundling protein espin (Figures 3C and 3D), which is abundantly expressed in the stereocilia of the mechanosensitive hair bundle, where it is necessary for hair cell function (Zheng et al., 2000Zheng L.

Per 104 plated cells, 1186 ± 150 (ESC derived) and 908 ± 209 (iPSC derived) cells were nGFP positive, 139 ± 49 and 113 ± 24 cells were nGFP and myosin VIIa positive, and 36 ± 7 and 24 ± 19 cells expressed both markers plus espin (n = 4). When we plated 104 control cells that were not subjected to D/S/I, but were otherwise treated identically, we only found a few (135 ± 84 and 30 ± 18, ESC and iPSC derived) nGFP-positive cells and no myosin VIIa- or espin-expressing cells (n = 4). These results show that D/S/I treatment is a specific requirement for hair cell differentiation from ESCs and iPSCs. Interestingly, the cells surrounding the nascent hair cell-like cells displayed nuclear immunoreactivity for p27Kip1 (Figures 3E and 3F), a cell-cycle regulator that is initially expressed in the nuclei of all cells of the prosensory domains of the developing inner ear and later becomes restricted to supporting cells (Chen and Segil, 1999Chen P.

https://openalex.org/W2161244514,"The Escherichia coli fimbrial adhesive protein, FimH, mediates shear-dependent binding to mannosylated surfaces via force-enhanced allosteric catch bonds, but the underlying structural mechanism was previously unknown. Here we present the crystal structure of FimH incorporated into the multiprotein fimbrial tip, where the anchoring (pilin) domain of FimH interacts with the mannose-binding (lectin) domain and causes a twist in the beta sandwich fold of the latter. This loosens the mannose-binding pocket on the opposite end of the lectin domain, resulting in an inactive low-affinity state of the adhesin. The autoinhibition effect of the pilin domain is removed by application of tensile force across the bond, which separates the domains and causes the lectin domain to untwist and clamp tightly around the ligand like a finger-trap toy. Thus, beta sandwich domains, which are common in multidomain proteins exposed to tensile force in vivo, can undergo drastic allosteric changes and be subjected to mechanical regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2074782921,"When the process of cell-fate determination is examined at single-cell resolution, it is often observed that individual cells undergo different fates even when subject to identical conditions. This ""noisy"" phenotype is usually attributed to the inherent stochasticity of chemical reactions in the cell. Here we demonstrate how the observed single-cell heterogeneity can be explained by a cascade of decisions occurring at the subcellular level. We follow the postinfection decision in bacteriophage lambda at single-virus resolution, and show that a choice between lysis and lysogeny is first made at the level of the individual virus. The decisions by all viruses infecting a single cell are then integrated in a precise (noise-free) way, such that only a unanimous vote by all viruses leads to the establishment of lysogeny. By detecting and integrating over the subcellular ""hidden variables,"" we are able to predict the level of noise measured at the single-cell level."
https://openalex.org/W2120372473,"Rubin Tuder and his colleagues show that cigarette smoke induces expression of Rtp801 (also known as Redd1), a hypoxia-inducible protein that inhibits mTOR activity and enhances oxidative stress–mediated cell death. They also show that mice deficient in Rtp801 are protected from cigarette smoke–induced lung injury, thus suggesting the protein as a target to prevent emphysema. Rtp801 (also known as Redd1, and encoded by Ddit4), a stress-related protein triggered by adverse environmental conditions, inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by stabilizing the TSC1-TSC2 inhibitory complex and enhances oxidative stress–dependent cell death. We postulated that Rtp801 acts as a potential amplifying switch in the development of cigarette smoke–induced lung injury, leading to emphysema. Rtp801 mRNA and protein were overexpressed in human emphysematous lungs and in lungs of mice exposed to cigarette smoke. The regulation of Rtp801 expression by cigarette smoke may rely on oxidative stress–dependent activation of the CCAAT response element in its promoter. We also found that Rtp801 was necessary and sufficient for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in cultured cells and, when forcefully expressed in mouse lungs, it promoted NF-κB activation, alveolar inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis of alveolar septal cells. In contrast, Rtp801 knockout mice were markedly protected against acute cigarette smoke–induced lung injury, partly via increased mTOR signaling, and, when exposed chronically to cigarette smoke, against emphysema. Our data support the notion that Rtp801 may represent a major molecular sensor and mediator of cigarette smoke–induced lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W2100295977,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is essential for intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(min/+) mice, but the mechanisms by which Apc enhances tumor growth are unknown. Here we show that microflora-MyD88-ERK signaling in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) promotes tumorigenesis by increasing the stability of the c-Myc oncoprotein. Activation of ERK (extracellular signal-related kinase) phosphorylates c-Myc, preventing its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Accordingly, Apc(min/+)/Myd88(-/-) mice have lower phospho-ERK (p-ERK) levels and fewer and smaller IEC tumors than Apc(min/+) mice. MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88)-independent activation of ERK by epidermal growth factor (EGF) increased p-ERK and c-Myc and restored the multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) phenotype in Apc(min/+)/Myd88(-/-) mice. Administration of an ERK inhibitor suppressed intestinal tumorigenesis in EGF-treated Apc(min/+)/Myd88(-/-) and Apc(min/+) mice and increased their survival. Our data reveal a new facet of oncogene-environment interaction, in which microflora-induced TLR activation regulates oncogene expression and related IEC tumor growth in a susceptible host."
https://openalex.org/W2002379520,"PTPN2 (protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2, also known as TC-PTP) is a cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase that functions as a negative regulator of a variety of tyrosine kinases and other signaling proteins. In agreement with its role in the regulation of the immune system, PTPN2 was identified as a susceptibility locus for autoimmune diseases. In this work, we describe the identification of focal deletions of PTPN2 in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Deletion of PTPN2 was specifically found in T-ALLs with aberrant expression of the TLX1 transcription factor oncogene, including four cases also expressing the NUP214-ABL1 tyrosine kinase. Knockdown of PTPN2 increased the proliferation and cytokine sensitivity of T-ALL cells. In addition, PTPN2 was identified as a negative regulator of NUP214-ABL1 kinase activity. Our study provides genetic and functional evidence for a tumor suppressor role of PTPN2 and suggests that expression of PTPN2 may modulate response to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2063315017,"17beta-estradiol (E2) has been implicated to exert neuroprotective effects in the brain following cerebral ischemia. Classically, E2 is thought to exert its effects via genomic signaling mediated by interaction with nuclear estrogen receptors. However, the role and contribution of extranuclear estrogen receptors (ER) is unclear and was the subject of the current study.To accomplish this goal, we employed two E2 conjugates (E2 dendrimer, EDC, and E2-BSA) that can interact with extranuclear ER and exert rapid nongenomic signaling, but lack the ability to interact with nuclear ER due to their inability to enter the nucleus. EDC or E2-BSA (10 microM) was injected icv 60 min prior to global cerebral ischemia (GCI). FITC-tagged EDC or E2-BSA revealed high uptake in the hippocampal CA1 region after icv injection, with a membrane (extranuclear) localization pattern in cells. Both EDC and E2-BSA exerted robust neuroprotection in the CA1 against GCI, and the effect was blocked by the ER antagonist, ICI182,780. EDC and E2-BSA both rapidly enhanced activation of the prosurvival kinases, ERK and Akt, while attenuating activation of the proapoptotic kinase, JNK following GCI, effects that were blocked by ICI182,780. Administration of an MEK or PI3K inhibitor blocked the neuroprotective effects of EDC and E2-BSA. Further studies showed that EDC increased p-CREB and BDNF in the CA1 region in an ERK- and Akt-dependent manner, and that cognitive outcome after GCI was preserved by EDC in an ER-dependent manner.In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that activation of extranuclear ER results in induction of ERK-Akt-CREB-BDNF signaling in the hippocampal CA1 region, which significantly reduces ischemic neuronal injury and preserves cognitive function following GCI. The study adds to a growing literature that suggests that extranuclear ER can have important actions in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2083893624,"Actively dividing cells perform robust and accurate DNA replication during fluctuating nutrient availability, yet factors that prevent disruption of replication remain largely unknown. Here we report that DksA, a nutrient-responsive transcription factor, ensures replication completion in Escherichia coli by removing transcription roadblocks. In the absence of DksA, replication is rapidly arrested upon amino acid starvation. This arrest requires active transcription and is alleviated by RNA polymerase mutants that compensate for DksA activity. This replication arrest occurs independently of exogenous DNA damage, yet it induces the DNA-damage response and recruits the main recombination protein RecA. This function of DksA is independent of its transcription initiation activity but requires its less-studied transcription elongation activity. Finally, GreA/B elongation factors also prevent replication arrest during nutrient stress. We conclude that transcription elongation factors alleviate fundamental conflicts between replication and transcription, thereby protecting replication fork progression and DNA integrity."

https://openalex.org/W2159615687,"Ras family small GTPases assume two interconverting conformations, ""inactive"" state 1 and ""active"" state 2, in their GTP-bound forms. Here, to clarify the mechanism of state transition, we have carried out x-ray crystal structure analyses of a series of mutant H-Ras and M-Ras in complex with guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate (GppNHp), representing various intermediate states of the transition. Crystallization of H-RasT35S-GppNHp enables us to solve the first complete tertiary structure of H-Ras state 1 possessing two surface pockets unseen in the state 2 or H-Ras-GDP structure. Moreover, determination of the two distinct crystal structures of H-RasT35S-GppNHp, showing prominent polysterism in the switch I and switch II regions, reveals a pivotal role of the guanine nucleotide-mediated interaction between the two switch regions and its rearrangement by a nucleotide positional change in the state 2 to state 1 transition. Furthermore, the (31)P NMR spectra and crystal structures of the GppNHp-bound forms of M-Ras mutants, carrying various H-Ras-type amino acid substitutions, also reveal the existence of a surface pocket in state 1 and support a similar mechanism based on the nucleotide-mediated interaction and its rearrangement in the state 1 to state 2 transition. Intriguingly, the conformational changes accompanying the state transition mimic those that occurred upon GDP/GTP exchange, indicating a common mechanistic basis inherent in the high flexibility of the switch regions. Collectively, these results clarify the structural features distinguishing the two states and provide new insights into the molecular basis for the state transition of Ras protein."

The modulation of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH) levels and iron chelation affected the actions of antibiotics. Interestingly, the deletion of the ferric reductase gene confers more antibiotic resistance upon cells, and its overexpression accelerates antibiotic-mediated cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2062053430,"Arterial thrombosis, a major cause of myocardial infarction and stroke, is initiated by activation of blood platelets by subendothelial collagen. The protein kinase C (PKC) family centrally regulates platelet activation, and it is becoming clear that the individual PKC isoforms play distinct roles, some of which oppose each other. Here, for the first time, we address all four of the major platelet-expressed PKC isoforms, determining their comparative roles in regulating platelet adhesion to collagen and their subsequent activation under physiological flow conditions. Using mouse gene knock-out and pharmacological approaches in human platelets, we show that collagen-dependent alpha-granule secretion and thrombus formation are mediated by the conventional PKC isoforms, PKCalpha and PKCbeta, whereas the novel isoform, PKC, negatively regulates these events. PKCdelta also negatively regulates thrombus formation but not alpha-granule secretion. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that individual PKC isoforms differentially regulate platelet calcium signaling and exposure of phosphatidylserine under flow. Although platelet deficient in PKCalpha or PKCbeta showed reduced calcium signaling and phosphatidylserine exposure, these responses were enhanced in the absence of PKC. In summary therefore, this direct comparison between individual subtypes of PKC, by standardized methodology under flow conditions, reveals that the four major PKCs expressed in platelets play distinct non-redundant roles, where conventional PKCs promote and novel PKCs inhibit thrombus formation on collagen."

To achieve our goals, we performed HPLC-based purification of stress granules (SGs), immunoanalysis of SGs with stress markers TIA-1, CUGBP1, and ph-eIF2, site-specific mutagenesis, and examinations of RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions in myoblasts from control and DM1 patients. The cause-and-effect relationships were addressed in stable cells expressing mutant CUG repeats. We found that the mutant CUGn RNA induces formation of SGs through the increase of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and following inactivation of eIF2α, one of the substrates of PKR. We show that SGs trap mRNA coding for the DNA repair and remodeling factor MRG15 (MORF4L1), translation of which is regulated by CUGBP1. As the result of the trapping, the levels of MRG15 are reduced in DM1 cells and in CUG-expressing cells. These data show that CUG repeats cause stress in DM1 through the PKR-ph-eIF2α pathway inhibiting translation of certain mRNAs, such as MRG15 mRNA. The repression of protein translation by stress might contribute to the progressive muscle loss in DM1."
https://openalex.org/W2027970965,"The fungal iterative nonreducing polyketide synthases (NRPKSs) synthesize aromatic polyketides, many of which have important biological activities. The product template domains (PT) embedded in the multidomain NRPKSs mediate the regioselective cyclization of the highly reactive polyketide backbones and dictate the final structures of the products. Understanding the sequence-activity relationships of different PT domains is therefore an important step toward the prediction of polyketide structures from NRPKS sequences and can enable the genome mining of hundreds of cryptic NRPKSs uncovered via genome sequencing. In this work, we first performed phylogenetic analysis of PT domains from NRPKSs of known functions and showed that the PT domains can be classified into five groups, with each group corresponding to a unique product size or cyclization regioselectivity. Group V contains the formerly unverified PT domains that were identified as C6-C11 aldol cyclases. The regioselectivity of PTs from this group were verified by product-based assays using the PT domain excised from the asperthecin AptA NRPKS. When combined with dissociated PKS4 minimal PKS, or replaced the endogenous PKS4 C2-C7 PT domain in a hybrid NRPKS, AptA-PT directed the C6-C11 cyclization of the nonaketide backbone to yield a tetracyclic pyranoanthraquinone 4. Extensive NMR analysis verified that the backbone of 4 was indeed cyclized with the expected regioselectivity. The PT phylogenetic analysis was then expanded to include approximately 100 PT sequences from unverified NRPKSs. Using the assays developed for AptA-PT, the regioselectivities of additional PT domains were investigated and matched to those predicted by the phylogenetic classifications."
https://openalex.org/W2098105712,"Background Microsporidia are obligate intracellular, eukaryotic pathogens that infect a wide range of animals from nematodes to humans, and in some cases, protists. The preponderance of evidence as to the origin of the microsporidia reveals a close relationship with the fungi, either within the kingdom or as a sister group to it. Recent phylogenetic studies and gene order analysis suggest that microsporidia share a particularly close evolutionary relationship with the zygomycetes. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we expanded this analysis and also examined a putative sex-locus for variability between microsporidian populations. Whole genome inspection reveals a unique syntenic gene pair (RPS9-RPL21) present in the vast majority of fungi and the microsporidians but not in other eukaryotic lineages. Two other unique gene fusions (glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase and ubiquitin-ribosomal subunit S30) that are present in metazoans, choanoflagellates, and filasterean opisthokonts are unfused in the fungi and microsporidians. One locus previously found to be conserved in many microsporidian genomes is similar to the sex locus of zygomycetes in gene order and architecture. Both sex-related and sex loci harbor TPT, HMG, and RNA helicase genes forming a syntenic gene cluster. We sequenced and analyzed the sex-related locus in 11 different Encephalitozoon cuniculi isolates and the sibling species E. intestinalis (3 isolates) and E. hellem (1 isolate). There was no evidence for an idiomorphic sex-related locus in this Encephalitozoon species sample. According to sequence-based phylogenetic analyses, the TPT and RNA helicase genes flanking the HMG genes are paralogous rather than orthologous between zygomycetes and microsporidians. Conclusion/Significance The unique genomic hallmarks between microsporidia and fungi are independent of sequence based phylogenetic comparisons and further contribute to define the borders of the fungal kingdom and support the classification of microsporidia as unusual derived fungi. And the sex/sex-related loci appear to have been subject to frequent gene conversion and translocations in microsporidia and zygomycetes."

We sought to determine the incidence and the long-term effects of TB during ART on HIV treatment outcome, and the risk factors for incident TB during ART in a large urban HIV clinic in Uganda. Methodology/Principal Findings Routinely collected longitudinal clinical data from all patients initiated on first-line ART was retrospectively analysed. 5,982 patients were included with a median baseline CD4+ T cell count (CD4 count) of 117 cells/mm3 (interquartile range [IQR]; 42, 182). In the first 2 years, there were 336 (5.6%) incident TB events in 10,710 person-years (py) of follow-up (3.14 cases/100pyar [95% CI 2.82–3.49]); incidence rates at 0–3, 3–6, 6–12 and 12–24 months were 11.25 (9.58–13.21), 6.27 (4.99–7.87), 2.47 (1.87–3.36) and 1.02 (0.80–1.31), respectively. Incident TB during ART was independently associated with baseline CD4 count of <50 cells/mm3 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.84 [1.25–2.70], P = 0.002) and male gender (HR 1.68 [1.34–2.11], P<0.001). After two years on ART, the patients who had developed TB in the first 12 months had a significantly lower median CD4 count increase (184 cells/mm3 [IQR; 107, 258, n = 118] vs 209 cells/mm3 [124, 309, n = 2166], P = 0.01), a larger proportion of suboptimal immune reconstitution according to two definitions (increase in CD4 count <200 cells/mm3: 57.4% vs 46.9%, P = 0.03, and absolute CD4 count <200 cells/mm3: 30.4 vs 19.9%, P = 0.006), and a higher percentage of immunological failure according to the WHO criteria (13.6% vs 6.5%, P = 0.003). Incident TB during ART was independently associated with poor CD4 count recovery and fulfilling WHO immunogical failure definitions. Conclusions/Significance Incident TB during ART occurs most often within 3 months and in patients with CD4 counts less than 50 cells/mm3. Incident TB during ART is associated with long-term impairment in immune recovery."

The cases positive for pandemic H1N1 virus had significantly higher risk of hospitalization than those positive for seasonal influenza-A viruses (OR: 1.7). Of 93 influenza related deaths, 57 and 8 deaths from Pune (urban) and 27 and 1 death from Pune (rural) were from pandemic H1N1 positive and seasonal-A positive cases respectively. The case fatality ratio 0.86% for pandemic H1N1 was significantly higher than that of seasonal-A (0.13%) and it was in category 3 of the pandemic severity index of CDC, USA. The data on the cumulative fatality of rural and urban Pune revealed that with time the epidemic is spreading to rural areas.The severity of the H1N1 influenza pandemic is less than that reported for 'Spanish flu 1918' but higher than other pandemics of the 20(th) century.

Reduction in the activity of Nek7 or its close paralog, Nek6, has previously been shown to arrest cells in mitosis, mainly at metaphase. In this study, we investigate the developmental and cellular roles of Nek7 kinase through the generation and analysis of Nek7-deficient mice. We show that absence of Nek7 leads to lethality in late embryogenesis or at early post-natal stages and to severe growth retardation. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Nek7(-/-) embryos show increase tendency for chromosomal lagging, micronuclei formation and cytokinesis failure. Tetraploidy and aneuploidy were commonly observed and their prevalence arises with MEFs passages. The frequency of multicentrosomal cells in the mutant's MEF cells was higher, and it commonly occurred concurrently with a binuclear phenotype, suggesting cytokinesis failure etiology. Lastly, the percentage of mutant MEF cells bearing primary cilia (PC) was low, whereas a cell population having two cilia appeared in the mutant MEFs. Taken together, these results confirm Nek7 as a regulator of cell division, and reveal it as an essential component for mammalian growth and survival. The intimate connection between tetraploidy, aneuploidy and cancer development suggests that Nek7 deregulation can induce oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2115482299,"Background The destructive plant disease potato late blight is caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary. This disease has remained particularly problematic despite intensive breeding efforts to integrate resistance into cultivated potato, largely because of the pathogen's ability to quickly evolve to overcome major resistance genes. The RB gene, identified in the wild potato species S. bulbocastanum, encodes a protein that confers broad-spectrum resistance to most P. infestans isolates through its recognition of highly conserved members of the corresponding pathogen effector family IPI-O. IpiO is a multigene family of effectors and while the majority of IPI-O proteins are recognized by RB to elicit host resistance, some variants exist that are able to elude detection (e.g. IPI-O4). Methods and Findings In the present study, analysis of ipiO variants among 40 different P. infestans isolates collected from Guatemala, Thailand, and the United States revealed a high degree of complexity within this gene family. Isolate aggressiveness was correlated with increased ipiO diversity and especially the presence of the ipiO4 variant. Furthermore, isolates expressing IPI-O4 overcame RB-mediated resistance in transgenic potato plants even when the resistance-eliciting IPI-O1 variant was present. In support of this finding, we observed that expression of IPI-O4 via Agrobacterium blocked recognition of IPI-O1, leading to inactivation of RB-mediated programmed cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana. Conclusions In this study we definitively demonstrate and provide the first evidence that P. infestans can defeat an R protein through inhibition of recognition of the corresponding effector protein."

Although the presence of high numbers of nevi is strongly associated with melanoma risk, the majority of benign nevi lack proliferative activity and never progress into malignancy despite harboring oncogenic alterations. Indeed, constitutively activating mutations affecting the N-RAS or B-RAF kinase components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway are found in over 80% of benign nevi (Bauer et al., 2007Bauer J.

Genet. 2003; 33: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). The prevailing view is that nevi have initiated a permanent form of proliferative arrest known as oncogene-induced senescence (reviewed in Prieur and Peeper, 2008Prieur A. Peeper D.S. Cellular senescence in vivo: a barrier to tumorigenesis.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Certainly, benign nevi display several markers of senescence growth arrest, including increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity and p16INK4a expression (Gray-Schopfer et al., 2006Gray-Schopfer V.C. Cheong S.C. Chong H. Chow J. Moss T. Abdel-Malek Z.A. Marais R. Wynford-Thomas D. Bennett D.C. Cellular senescence in naevi and immortalisation in melanoma: a role for p16?.Br. J.

Although the presence of senescent cells in human melanocytic nevi remains controversial (Cotter et al., 2007Cotter M.A. Florell S.R. Leachman S.A. Grossman D. Absence of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity in human melanocytic nevi in vivo.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 2469-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), accumulating evidence suggests that senescence occurs in vivo and acts as an effective barrier to tumor formation (reviewed in Prieur and Peeper, 2008Prieur A. Peeper D.S. Cellular senescence in vivo: a barrier to tumorigenesis.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In this regard, identification of the molecules that enforce oncogene-induced arrest in human melanocytes is of prime importance as their loss may be a critical step in the escape of malignant clones and the consequent development of melanoma. These molecules are also potential therapeutic targets, as reinstating their functions may stimulate entry into senescence. In an attempt to identify these molecules, a genome-wide loss-of-function screen was used to define essential regulators of B-RAFV600E-induced senescence (Wajapeyee et al., 2008Wajapeyee N.

Notably, this oncogenic form of B-RAF occurs in 40%–50% of melanomas (reviewed in Platz et al., 2008Platz A. Egyhazi S. Ringborg U. Hansson J.

Seventeen genes were identified and the suppression of each permitted diploid human fibroblasts to proliferate and survive in the presence of oncogenic B-RAFV600E. Among these were p53 and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 7 (IGFBP7). IGFBP7 is a secreted protein that reduces the bioavailability of insulin/IGF in peripheral blood and has been implicated in tumor suppression of breast, colon, lung, and pancreatic cancers (Burger et al., 1998Burger A.M. Zhang X. Li H. Ostrowski J.L. Beatty B. Venanzoni M. Papas T. Seth A.

Oncol. 2007; 133: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). B-RAFV600E was also shown to upregulate IGFBP7 expression via the B-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade. IGFBP7 inhibited phosphorylation of MEK by B-RAF, initiating a negative-feedback loop. Consistent with the hypothesis that IGFBP7 suppresses early B-RAF-driven tumor formations in vivo, expression of IGFBP7 was highly expressed in B-RAFV600E-positive nevi and in primary melanomas and melanoma cell lines lacking activated B-RAF but was lost in B-RAFV600E-positive melanomas and melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, purified recombinant IGFBP7 potently suppressed the growth of B-RAFV600E-positive human melanomas but had no effect on tumors with wild-type B-RAF (Wajapeyee et al., 2008Wajapeyee N.

Oncogenic BRAF induces senescence and apoptosis through pathways mediated by the secreted protein IGFBP7.Cell. 2008; 132: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Taken together these observations suggest that IGFBP7 is essential in constraining B-RAFV600E-stimulated cell proliferation. In this work we readdressed the role of IGFBP7 in B-RAFV600E-induced senescence in diploid human melanocytes. This was particularly important as two recent reports did not detect a correlation between B-RAF mutation status and IGFBP7 expression in a panel of primary melanomas and metastases (Schrama et al., 2009Schrama D. Kneitz H. Willmes C. Adam C. Houben R. Becker J.C. Lack of correlation between IGFBP7 expression and BRAF mutational status in melanoma.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2009; 130: 897-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, Wajapeyee et al., 2009Wajapeyee N. Kapoor V. Mahalingam M. Green M.R. Efficacy of IGFBP7 for treatment of metastatic melanoma and other cancers in mouse models and human cell lines.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2009; 8: 3009-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We also found no correlation between B-RAF mutational status and IGFBP7 expression levels in a series of melanoma cell lines, melanomas, and benign nevi. Furthermore, in contrast to the previous report (Wajapeyee et al., 2008Wajapeyee N. Serra R.W. Zhu X. Mahalingam M. Green M.R. Oncogenic BRAF induces senescence and apoptosis through pathways mediated by the secreted protein IGFBP7.Cell. 2008; 132: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that B-RAF signaling does not induce IGFBP7 expression in either human melanocytes or fibroblasts, and using a lentiviral silencing strategy we show that B-RAF potently induces senescence in the presence and absence of IGFBP7. Therefore, we conclude that the secreted protein IGFBP7 is dispensable for B-RAFV600E-induced senescence in human melanocytes. To evaluate the response of human cells to oncogenic B-RAF, the melanoma-associated B-RAFV600E mutant was stably transduced into primary diploid HEM1455 melanocytes and HDF1314 epidermal fibroblasts using lentiviral vectors coexpressing Copepod GFP (copGFP). Viral titers were selected to provide an efficiency of infection above 90% and activation of the ERK pathway that was comparable to human melanoma cells expressing endogenous B-RAFV600E (Figure 1A ). As expected from previous studies, expression of oncogenic B-RAF efficiently blocked cellular proliferation and induced SA-β-Gal activity as early as 5 days after infection (Figure 1B). The majority of B-RAFV600E-transduced melanocytes and fibroblasts displayed several markers of oncogene-driven senescence, increased SA-β-Gal expression, senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), and significantly decreased Ki67 expression (Figure 1B). Each focus in a senescent cell results from condensation of an individual chromosome and is enriched for common markers of heterochromatin, including histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9Me) and the nonhistone chromatin protein HMGA2 (Figure 1C) (reviewed in Adams, 2007Adams P.D. Remodeling of chromatin structure in senescent cells and its potential impact on tumor suppression and aging.Gene. 2007; 397: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The accumulation of oncogenic B-RAFV600E in both melanocytes and fibroblasts was associated with increased levels of phosphorylated ERK and induction of the CDK inhibitor p16INK4a. In addition, the levels of p53 were significantly repressed and expression of the p53-transcription target p21Waf1 remained low or was reduced by the accumulation of B-RAFV600E (Figure 1D). It has been suggested that senescence triggered by oncogenic B-RAF is associated with the transcriptional upregulation of IGFBP7 (Wajapeyee et al., 2008Wajapeyee N. Serra R.W. Zhu X. Mahalingam M. Green M.R. Oncogenic BRAF induces senescence and apoptosis through pathways mediated by the secreted protein IGFBP7.Cell. 2008; 132: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). We therefore reanalyzed the expression of IGFBP7 and conclusively show that oncogenic B-RAF represses, rather than induces, IGFBP7 expression in both human melanocytes and fibroblasts (Figure 2A and Figure S1 available online). Indeed, B-RAFV600E-transduced melanocytes and fibroblasts displayed diminished levels of cellular and secreted IGFBP7 compared to the control copGFP-transduced cells (Figure 2A and Figure S1). The depletion of IGFBP7 was routinely observed as early as 2 days post-B-RAFV600E transduction and was maintained for the duration of the transduction experiments (5 days and 15 days post-transduction of melanocytes and fibroblasts, respectively). The slight increase in secreted IGFBP7 in melanocytes, 2 days post-transduction with oncogenic B-RAFV600E, was not consistent over replicate experiments and did not correspond with an increase in cellular IGFBP7 at this time point (Figure 2A). The depletion of IGFBP7 occurred earlier than the onset of BRAFV600E-induced senescence (see Figure 1B). Furthermore, the specific silencing of oncogenic B-RAF or the addition of a MEK inhibitor led to the accumulation of IGFBP7 in melanoma cell lines expressing the B-RAFV600E variant (Figure 2B).Figure S1Oncogenic B-RAFV600E Expression Does Not Induce IGFBP7 Accumulation, Related to Figure 2AShow full captionImmunoblot analysis monitoring the accumulation of IGFBP7 in WS1 human fibroblasts infected with copGFP control lentivirus (−) or lentivirus expressing B-RAFV600E (+).

Protein expression was analyzed at 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 days post-transduction (PT), as indicated. To further scrutinize the correlation of IGFBP7 expression with B-RAF mutation status, we analyzed a series of 22 melanoma cell lines for IGFBP7 expression. In this series, we did not find a correlation between IGFBP7 expression and B-RAF mutation status, as IGFBP7 was detected in 10/14 B-RAF mutant and 3/8 B-RAF wild-type tumor lines (Figure 2C). Further, we found no correlation between B-RAF mutation status and IGFBP7 transcript levels in gene expression microarray analyses of 99 metastatic melanoma tumors (Figure 3A , Table 1). This was confirmed at the protein level by tissue microarray analyses of 90 of these tumors (Figure 3B, Table 2). Consistent with these data, we did not observe increased expression of several IGFBP7-regulated gene products, including SMARCB1, BNIP3L, and PEA15 (Wajapeyee et al., 2008Wajapeyee N. Serra R.W.

Finally, IGFBP7 protein expression did not correlate with B-RAF mutation status in a series of human benign nevi (Figure 3D, Table 2). Collectively these data indicate that B-RAFV600E does not upregulate IGFBP7 expression in fibroblasts or melanocytes nor is the loss of IGFBP7 required for the development of B-RAFV600E-positive melanomas.Table 1Median and Interquartile Ranges of Transcript Expression by B-RAF Status in Metastatic Melanomas Together with Associated p Values (Mann-Whitney Test)B-RAF StatusWild-TypeMutantTranscriptsMedian(LQ, UQ)Median(LQ, UQ)p ValueBNIP3L818402, 1556768262, 14470.591IGFBP774615057, 1431282904978, 126470.886PEA1574235369, 910561254057, 99730.129SMARCB11070667, 2032772562, 15280.109TP53301181, 586219135, 5200.124UQ, upper quartile; LQ, lower quartile.

To specifically examine the contribution of IGFBP7 to B-RAF-mediated senescence, we applied lentiviral shRNA vectors that specifically suppress the expression of IGFBP7. To minimize confounding effects of shRNA off-target silencing two independent silencing molecules targeting IGFBP7 were generated (Wajapeyee et al., 2008Wajapeyee N. Serra R.W. Zhu X. Mahalingam M. Green M.R. Oncogenic BRAF induces senescence and apoptosis through pathways mediated by the secreted protein IGFBP7.Cell. 2008; 132: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). These silencing constructs were highly effective in silencing the expression of IGFBP7. The role of IGFBP7 in oncogene-induced senescence was evaluated in human melanocytes (HEM1455, nHEM) and fibroblasts (HDF1314, WS1, and BJ), and the results for HDF1314 and HEM1455 are depicted in detail. Cells were transduced with an IGFBP7 shRNA molecule coexpressing copGFP and 3 days post-infection were retransduced with lentiviral vectors expressing B-RAFV600E with copGFP or copGFP alone. All experiments included a negative control shRNA molecule without homology to any human gene. Just as in our previous single transduction experiments, transduction efficiencies reached at least 90% in all cells (Figure S2A ) and there was no need for antibiotic selection. This strategy proved effective as the depletion of pRb along with p53 using highly effective short-hairpin RNAs (Haferkamp et al., 2009aHaferkamp S. Tran S. Becker T.M. Scurr L.L. Kefford R.F. Rizos H. The relative contributions of the p53 and pRb pathways in oncogene-induced melanocyte senescence.Aging. 2009; 1: 542-556PubMed Google Scholar) overcame B-RAFV600E-induced melanocyte cell-cycle arrest (Figure S2B). As expected, all melanocytes and fibroblasts transduced with the combination of control shRNA and B-RAFV600E expressed markers associated with the onset of senescence. These included significantly reduced levels of the proliferation marker Ki67, accumulation of SAHF, and increased SA-β-Gal activity (Figures 4A and 4B ). Importantly, inhibition of IGFBP7 expression did not alter the growth arrest induced by oncogenic B-RAFV600E, and cells were arrested after infection, stained positive for SA-β-Gal, and accumulated DAPI-stained foci regardless of the expression level of IGFBP7 (Figures 4A and 4B). In addition, the induction of p16INK4a associated with oncogenic B-RAF expression was also maintained in melanocytes and fibroblasts regardless of IGFBP7 expression (Figure 5).Figure 5Oncogenic B-RAF Signaling Induces ERK Activation and p16INK4a Expression and Downregulates p53 in the Presence and Absence of IGFBP7 ExpressionShow full captionExpression of the indicated proteins was determined by western blot analysis after infection of human epidermal melanocytes and fibroblasts with the indicated shRNA constructs and either lentiviruses encoding B-RAFV600E or the copGFP (−) control.

Similar results were obtained when IGFBP7-silenced fibroblasts (data not shown) and melanocytes were selected using puromycin prior to reinfection with oncogenic B-RAFV600E (Figure S2C). This antibiotic selection strategy resembled the experimental design employed by Wajapeyee et al., 2008Wajapeyee N. Serra R.W. Zhu X. Mahalingam M. Green M.R. Oncogenic BRAF induces senescence and apoptosis through pathways mediated by the secreted protein IGFBP7.Cell. 2008; 132: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar and confirmed that IGFBP7 was not essential for B-RAFV600E-induced senescence as its depletion did not prevent cell-cycle arrest, formation of DAPI-stained foci, or the induction of SA-β-Gal activity (Figure S2C). The detection of senescent cells in vivo suggests that senescence is a genuine, physiological tumor suppressor mechanism, and this notion has intensified the search for the molecules that initiate and maintain this proliferative arrest. In a landmark study, a genome-wide shRNA screen identified 17 genes that were essential for B-RAFV600E-induced senescence in human fibroblasts and melanocytes. Two of these essential candidates were p53 and the secreted protein IGFBP7 (Wajapeyee et al., 2008Wajapeyee N. Serra R.W. Zhu X. Mahalingam M. Green M.R.

We and others have shown that p53 levels are not induced by oncogenic B-RAF in human melanocytes (Gray-Schopfer et al., 2006Gray-Schopfer V.C. Cheong S.C. Chong H. Chow J. Moss T. Abdel-Malek Z.A.

Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several reports have confirmed that inactivation of p53 alone does not prevent B-RAF-induced senescence in melanocytes (Denoyelle et al., 2006Denoyelle C. Abou-Rjaily G. Bezrookove V.

In keeping with these findings, immortal melanocytes accumulating oncogenic B-RAF and silenced for p53 expression did arise in one investigation. However, these immortal cells had acquired a substantial deletion in chromosome 13, which encodes the pRb1 tumor suppressor gene (Yu et al., 2009Yu H. McDaid R. Lee J. Possik P. Li L. Kumar S.M. Elder D.E. Van Belle P. Gimotty P. Guerra M. et al.The role of BRAF mutation and p53 inactivation during transformation of a subpopulation of primary human melanocytes.Am. J.

Indeed, loss of both pRb and p53 is sufficient to overcome both N-RASQ61K- (Haferkamp et al., 2009aHaferkamp S. Tran S. Becker T.M. Scurr L.L. Kefford R.F. Rizos H. The relative contributions of the p53 and pRb pathways in oncogene-induced melanocyte senescence.Aging. 2009; 1: 542-556PubMed Google Scholar) and B-RAFV600E-induced (Figure S2B) senescence in melanocytes. Collectively these data strongly indicate that p53 is not required for B-RAF-induced senescence in melanocytes in vitro and in vivo. Because IGFBP7 might also have clinical potential, we used four independent experimental strategies to reanalyze the reported contribution of IGFBP7 to B-RAF-induced senescence. First, we examined the regulation of IGFBP7 by oncogenic B-RAF in several melanocyte and fibroblast cells. We did not detect any significant upregulation of IGFBP7 in response to oncogenic B-RAF. In fact we saw significant reduction in IGFBP7 in all primary cells tested, and a slight IGFBP7 upregulation was only seen in response to silencing of B-RAFV600E or inhibiting the MAPK pathway using a MEK inhibitor in melanoma cell lines harboring oncogenic B-RAFV600E. IGFBP7 is transcriptionally regulated by p53 (Suzuki et al., 2009Suzuki H. Igarashi S. Nojima M. Maruyama R. Yamamoto E. Kai M. Akashi H. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto H.

https://openalex.org/W2001574389,"ClC-3 is a Cl−/H+ antiporter required for cytokine-induced intraendosomal reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by Nox1. ClC-3 current is distinct from the swelling-activated chloride current (IClswell), but overexpression of ClC-3 can activate currents that resemble IClswell. Because H2O2 activates IClswell directly, we hypothesized that ClC-3-dependent, endosomal ROS production activates IClswell. Whole-cell perforated patch clamp methods were used to record Cl− currents in cultured aortic vascular smooth muscle cells from wild type (WT) and ClC-3 null mice. Under isotonic conditions, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (10 ng/ml) activated outwardly rectifying Cl− currents with time-dependent inactivation in WT but not ClC-3 null cells. Inhibition by tamoxifen (10 μm) and by hypertonicity (340 mosm) identified them as IClswell. IClswell was also activated by H2O2 (500 μm), and the effect of TNF-α was completely inhibited by polyethylene glycol-catalase. ClC-3 expression induced IClswell in ClC-3 null cells in the absence of swelling or TNF-α, and this effect was also blocked by catalase. IClswell activation by hypotonicity (240 mosm) was only partially inhibited by catalase, and the size of these currents did not differ between WT and ClC-3 null cells. Disruption of endosome trafficking with either mutant Rab5 (S34N) or Rab11 (S25N) inhibited TNF-α-mediated activation of IClswell. Thrombin also activates ROS production by Nox1 but not in endosomes. Thrombin caused H2O2-dependent activation of IClswell, but this effect was not ClC-3- or Rab5-dependent. Thus, activation of IClswell by TNF-α requires ClC-3-dependent endosomal H2O2 production. This demonstrates a functional link between two distinct anion currents, ClC-3 and IClswell. ClC-3 is a Cl−/H+ antiporter required for cytokine-induced intraendosomal reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by Nox1. ClC-3 current is distinct from the swelling-activated chloride current (IClswell), but overexpression of ClC-3 can activate currents that resemble IClswell. Because H2O2 activates IClswell directly, we hypothesized that ClC-3-dependent, endosomal ROS production activates IClswell. Whole-cell perforated patch clamp methods were used to record Cl− currents in cultured aortic vascular smooth muscle cells from wild type (WT) and ClC-3 null mice. Under isotonic conditions, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (10 ng/ml) activated outwardly rectifying Cl− currents with time-dependent inactivation in WT but not ClC-3 null cells. Inhibition by tamoxifen (10 μm) and by hypertonicity (340 mosm) identified them as IClswell. IClswell was also activated by H2O2 (500 μm), and the effect of TNF-α was completely inhibited by polyethylene glycol-catalase. ClC-3 expression induced IClswell in ClC-3 null cells in the absence of swelling or TNF-α, and this effect was also blocked by catalase. IClswell activation by hypotonicity (240 mosm) was only partially inhibited by catalase, and the size of these currents did not differ between WT and ClC-3 null cells. Disruption of endosome trafficking with either mutant Rab5 (S34N) or Rab11 (S25N) inhibited TNF-α-mediated activation of IClswell. Thrombin also activates ROS production by Nox1 but not in endosomes. Thrombin caused H2O2-dependent activation of IClswell, but this effect was not ClC-3- or Rab5-dependent. Thus, activation of IClswell by TNF-α requires ClC-3-dependent endosomal H2O2 production. This demonstrates a functional link between two distinct anion currents, ClC-3 and IClswell. IntroductionClC-3 is a member of the CLC family of Cl− channels and Cl−/H+ antiporters. When expressed in HEK293 cells, it behaves as an antiporter at neutral pH (1.Matsuda J.J. Filali M.S. Volk K.A. Collins M.M. Moreland J.G. Lamb F.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C251-C262Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, at high extracellular proton concentrations, transport becomes uncoupled, and ClC-3 behaves as an anion-selective pore (2.Matsuda J.J. Filali M.S. Collins M.M. Volk K.A. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2569-2579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This mode of ClC-3 activity may account for the native acid-activated current in HEK293 cells (3.Lambert S. Oberwinkler J. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 191-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The basic biophysical properties of ClC-3 currents are similar under both coupled and uncoupled conditions. They display very sharp outward rectification and time-dependent activation. Mutation of the extracellular fast gate (E224A) alters both of these characteristics, and inhibition of wild type ClC-3 current by alkanethiolation with methanethiosulfonate can be prevented by deletion of cysteine residues in the first extracellular loop of the protein. These properties clearly associate the currents induced by ClC-3 expression with ClC-3 protein (1.Matsuda J.J. Filali M.S. Volk K.A. Collins M.M. Moreland J.G. Lamb F.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C251-C262Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 2.Matsuda J.J. Filali M.S. Collins M.M. Volk K.A. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2569-2579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).However, heterologous expression of ClC-3 has also been repeatedly associated with a less sharply outwardly rectifying anion current that displays time-dependent inactivation instead of activation. Currents induced in NIH3T3 cells by plasmid-mediated ClC-3 overexpression appeared indistinguishable from the swelling-activated anion current (IClswell), 2The abbreviations used are: IClswellswelling-induced anion currentCamKIIcalcium-calmodulin kinase IIGFPgreen florescent proteinH2O2hydrogen peroxideROSreactive oxygen speciesTNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αVSMvascular smooth muscleWTwild typeILinterleukinEGFepidermal growth factorpFpicofarad. and it was suggested that ClC-3 was an IClswell (4.Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This idea was supported by a demonstration that anti-ClC-3 antibodies placed within the patch pipette block IClswell activation under hypotonic conditions (5.Duan D. Zhong J. Hermoso M.

Other investigators have identified a calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CamKII)-dependent Cl− current in cells expressing ClC-3 (11.Huang P. Liu J. Di A. Robinson N.C. Musch M.W. Kaezel M.A. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20093-20100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These currents, which look like IClswell, were not responsive to changes in cell volume and were absent in smooth muscle cells (19.Robinson N.C. Huang P. Kaetzel M.A. Lamb F.S. Nelson D.J. J. Physiol. 2004; 556: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and hippocampal neurons from ClC-3 null mice (20.Wang X.Q. Deriy L.V. Foss S. Huang P. Lamb F.S. Kaetzel M.A. Bindokas V.

We hypothesized that these apparently disparate data might be reconciled if ClC-3 is required for regulation of IClswell.Multiple lines of evidence have established a relationship between ClC-3, NADPH oxidase activity, and signaling via reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nox1 and ClC-3 co-localize to early endosomes in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells, and both are required for tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-1β)-dependent ROS generation and for the subsequent activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (21.Miller Jr., F.J.

Intracellular but not extracellular Nox2 activity in neutrophils also requires ClC-3. The intracellular oxidative burst (22.Moreland J.G. Davis A.P. Bailey G. Nauseef W.M. Lamb F.S. J. Biol.

We have proposed that ClC-3 provides charge neutralization of electron flow through NADPH oxidase, into intracellular vesicles (1.Matsuda J.J. Filali M.S. Volk K.A. Collins M.M. Moreland J.G.

Physiol. 2004; 124: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) also requires H2O2 production that is triggered via a sequential pathway that involves angiotensin II and EGF receptor activation (28.Browe D.M.

Physiol. 2005; 288: H2628-H2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hypoosmotic stress has also been linked to Nox activation and subsequent ROS production in cultured brain astrocytes (31.Reinehr R. Görg B. Becker S. Qvartskhava N. Bidmon H.J. Selbach O. Haas H.L. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Glia. 2007; 55: 758-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Finally, the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine has been shown to activate IClswell via Nox activation in HeLa cells (32.Shimizu T. Numata T. Okada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6770-6773Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).We tested the hypothesis that TNF-α-dependent generation of H2O2 activates IClswell in VSM cells. Because TNF-α-induced H2O2 production is ClC-3-dependent, the Cl−/H+ antiporter would be expected to be required for the process. The results of these studies provide evidence that endosomal ClC-3-dependent ROS production is required for cytokine-mediated activation of IClswell.DISCUSSIONIn VSM cells, TNF-α activates Cl− currents that are indistinguishable from those elicited by hypotonic conditions. The response to TNF-α is absent in ClC-3 null cells and is blocked in WT cells by scavenging of H2O2 or impairment of either early endosome processing or endosome recycling to the plasma membrane. Thrombin and cell swelling also cause H2O2-dependent IClswell activation but via pathways that are ClC-3-independent.The fact that TNF-α activates IClswell is novel but perhaps not so surprising. Cytokines are well known to cause ROS generation (21.Miller Jr., F.J. Filali M. Huss G.J. Stanic B. Chamseddine A. Barna T.J. Lamb F.S. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 39.Galkina E. Ley K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), and activation of IClswell by hypotonic conditions is H2O2-dependent (26.Varela D. Simon F. Riveros A. Jørgensen F. Stutzin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13301-13304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27.Ren Z. Raucci Jr., F.J. Browe D.M. Baumgarten C.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 77: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28.Browe D.M. Baumgarten C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The most significant observation in this study is that TNF-α ROS signaling requires ClC-3, whereas responses to hypotonicity and thrombin do not. This suggests that VSM cells have at least two ROS-generating mechanisms that operate in parallel with respect to activation of IClswell. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that the roles of ClC-3 and IClswell have been difficult to discriminate. ClC-3 independence of the response to hypotonicity is in accordance with the work of multiple other investigators who have also seen no reduction in the magnitude of IClswell in various ClC-3 null cells (6.Yamamoto-Mizuma S.

Thus, in VSM cells, swelling-induced ROS production most likely occurs somewhere other than in early endosomes, where Nox1 activity is ClC-3-dependent (21.Miller Jr., F.J. Filali M. Huss G.J. Stanic B. Chamseddine A. Barna T.J. Lamb F.S. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 22.Moreland J.G. Davis A.P. Bailey G. Nauseef W.M. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12277-12288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Like TNF-α, thrombin also activates Nox1 (34.Miller Jr., F.J. Chu X. Stanic B. Tian X. Sharma R.V. Davisson R.L. Lamb F.S. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2010; 12: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and causes proinflammatory responses that are very similar to those linked to TNF-α (40.Martorell L. Martínez-González J. Rodríguez C. Gentile M. Calvayrac O. Badimon L. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 99: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the effects of thrombin are endocytosis-independent (34.Miller Jr., F.J. Chu X. Stanic B. Tian X. Sharma R.V. Davisson R.L. Lamb F.S. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2010; 12: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and accordingly, IClswell activation by thrombin is not impaired in ClC-3 null cells (see Fig. 9 for a schematic overview). Like thrombin, hypotonicity-induced ROS production may utilize Nox1 in the plasma membrane. Alternatively Nox4 has been shown to be activated by hypotonic stress, and the ROS produced in turn can activate IClswell in NIH3T3 cells (41.Friis M.B. Vorum K.G. Lambert I.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C1552-C1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Links between ClC-3 Expression and IClswellClC-3 overexpression activates anion currents with biophysical properties very similar to those of IClswell. Observations linking ClC-3 to IClswell include 1) enhanced current in ClC-3-expressing cells (4.Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B.

However, as shown in Fig. 4, IClswell has repeatedly been found to be unaltered in cells lacking ClC-3 (6.Yamamoto-Mizuma S. Wang G.X. Liu L.L. Schegg K. Hatton W.J. Duan D. Horowitz T.L. Lamb F.S.

In previous work, we have characterized ClC-3 currents that are very different from IClswell. They have time-dependent activation rather than inactivation and are much more sharply outwardly rectifying. ClC-3 currents are similar to those produced by ClC-4 and ClC-5 except that the time constants of activation are slower (1.Matsuda J.J. Filali M.S. Volk K.A. Collins M.M. Moreland J.G. Lamb F.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C251-C262Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 2.Matsuda J.J. Filali M.S. Collins M.M. Volk K.A. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2569-2579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These currents are inhibited by the same anti-ClC-3 antibody that was previously shown to inhibit IClswell (supplemental Fig. 2). Reconciliation of the existence of unique ClC-3 currents with the many observations linking ClC-3 to IClswell is obviously challenging. We believe that much of the association between ClC-3 expression and IClswell can be attributed to effects of altered ClC-3 abundance or function on endosomal ROS signaling, which in turn controls the activity of a distinct anion conductance, IClswell.TNF-α and IL-1β both failed to activate IClswell in ClC-3 null VSM cells (Fig. 1), yet H2O2 (Fig. 2), swelling (Fig. 4), and thrombin (Fig. 7) all elicited normal responses. Overexpression of ClC-3, in the absence of any other stimulus, activated IClswell in ClC-3 null VSM cells (Fig. 3). Both the current induced by cytokines and by ClC-3 overexpression were blocked by scavenging of H2O2 with catalase. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the relatively small increments in current caused by TNF-α in ClC-3-overexpressing cells and by hypotonic conditions in TNF-α stimulated cells, these three currents were clearly not additive. Taken together, our findings suggest that all three stimuli increase ROS production and thereby activate the independent anion conductance that produces IClswell.In addition to TNF-α, IL-1β, and thrombin, multiple other receptor-coupled stimuli, including angiotensin II, growth factors (28.Browe D.M. Baumgarten C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 43.Clempus R.E. Griendling K.K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and lysophosphatidic acid (41.Friis M.B. Vorum K.G. Lambert I.H. Am. J. Physiol.

Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C535-C542Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), have been shown to cause ROS production and also activate IClswell. Although not all have been tested, the current activated by lysophosphatidic acid has been shown to be ClC-3 expression-dependent (42.Yin Z. Tong Y. Zhu H. Watsky M.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C535-C542Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Many of these agonists mobilize intracellular calcium, which can activate CamKII. This enzyme has been linked to regulation of a chloride conductance that shares many basic properties (rectification, time-dependent inactivation, ion selectivity) with IClswell. Activation of this current is dependent upon ClC-3 expression (11.Huang P. Liu J. Di A. Robinson N.C. Musch M.W. Kaezel M.A. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20093-20100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and is absent in ClC-3 null cells (19.Robinson N.C. Huang P. Kaetzel M.A. Lamb F.S. Nelson D.J. J. Physiol. 2004; 556: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a specific serine on the N terminus of ClC-3 has been identified as the site of CamKII regulation (19.Robinson N.C. Huang P. Kaetzel M.A. Lamb F.S. Nelson D.J. J. Physiol. 2004; 556: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It will be important to determine if CamKII phosphorylation of ClC-3 is required for endosomal H2O2 production and thereby IClswell activation. CamKII activation itself is regulated by ROS in a complex manner (44.Trebak M. Ginnan R. Singer H.A. Jourd'heuil D. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 12: 657-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and both ROS-dependent NF-κB stimulation and CamKII activation are required for induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule expression by IL-1β (45.Luo S.F. Chang C.C. Lee I.T. Lee C.W. Lin W.N. Lin C.C. Yang C.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2009; 237: 8-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the molecular mechanism by which H2O2 actually activates IClswell has not received much attention. In rat hepatoma cells, the mechanism has been proposed to be indirect and involve phospholipase Cγ1 phosphorylation and calcium mobilization (46.Varela D. Simon F. Olivero P. Armisén R. Leiva-Salcedo E. Jørgensen F. Sala F. Stutzin A. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 20: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).It is important to note that we see a very different response to ClC-3 overexpression in HEK293 cells, where adenoviral expression of ClC-3 results in enough ClC-3 being present in the plasma membrane to allow us to measure ClC-3 current at pH 7.35 (1.Matsuda J.J.

Volk K.A. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2569-2579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) but does not activate IClswell. We can only speculate on the reason for this important difference, but it may be related to the relative amount of ClC-3 and/or IClswell that cycles thought the plasma membrane. This is not to say that there is no ClC-3 in the plasma membrane of VSM cells. The ability of low pH to activate endogenous ClC-3 current (Fig. 8 and Ref. 2.Matsuda J.J. Filali M.S. Collins M.M. Volk K.A. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2569-2579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) demonstrates that ClC-3 is present but is not detectable at physiologic pH and is clearly distinct from IClswell. The fact that ClC-3 expression activates IClswell in VSM cells, but not in HEK293 cells, highlights what may be very significant cell type-dependent variability in the interdependence of ClC-3 and IClswell. This may complicate the reconciliation of all data related to ClC-3 expression and IClswell.Endosome Dependence of IClswell ActivationRab guanosine triphosphatases control budding and fission of vesicles and localize to specific intracellular compartments. Rab5 regulates the biogenesis and trafficking of early endosomes (35.Dinneen J.L. Ceresa B.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Dominant negative S34N Rab5 inhibits early endosomal fusion (47.Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) and impairs proper processing of both transferrin and epidermal growth factor receptors (35.Dinneen J.L. Ceresa B.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Rab11 controls movement of proteins through a recycling compartment that forms via processing of early endosomes and mediates movement of endocytosed proteins back to the plasma membrane (48.Seachrist J.L. Ferguson S.S. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 49.Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol.

S25N Rab11 disrupts this process and impairs both processing of and signaling via G-protein-coupled receptors, including the lysophosphatidic acid receptor (48.Seachrist J.L. Ferguson S.S.

Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4188-4200Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Both S34N Rab5 and S25N Rab11 profoundly impaired the ability of TNF-α (Fig. 6), but not thrombin (Fig. 7) or hypotonic buffer (Fig. 6A), to activate IClswell. There are two potential interpretations of these data. Either proper processing or positioning of H2O2-producing endosomes is required for IClswell activation, or IClswell is activated within endosomes and recycled back to the plasma membrane in an active state. ROS-producing endosomes are Rab5-positive (21.Miller Jr., F.J. Filali M. Huss G.J. Stanic B. Chamseddine A. Barna T.J. Lamb F.S. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and the Rab5 compartment is “upstream” of Rab11. Therefore, the ability of the Rab11 mutant, which does not impede function until after early endosome f"

Importantly, many oncolytic virus candidates, such as reovirus and myxoma virus, preferentially infect cancer cells bearing abnormal cellular signaling pathways. Reovirus and myxoma virus are highly responsive to activated Ras and Akt signaling pathways, respectively, for their specificity for viral oncolysis. However, considering the complexity of cancer cell populations, it is possible that other tumor-specific signaling pathways may also contribute to viral discrimination between normal versus cancer cells. Because carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving the accumulation of both oncogene activations and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, we speculated that not only oncogenes but also tumor suppressor genes may have an important role in determining the tropism of these viruses for cancer cells. It has been previously shown that many cellular tumor suppressor genes, such as p53, ATM and Rb, are important for maintaining genomic stability; dysfunction of these tumor suppressors may disrupt intact cellular antiviral activity due to the accumulation of genomic instability or due to interference with apoptotic signaling. Therefore, we speculated that cells with dysfunctional tumor suppressors may display enhanced susceptibility to challenge with these oncolytic viruses, as previously seen with adenovirus. We report here that both reovirus and myxoma virus preferentially infect cancer cells bearing dysfunctional or deleted p53, ATM and Rb tumor suppressor genes compared to cells retaining normal counterparts of these genes. Thus, oncolysis by these viruses may be influenced by both oncogenic activation and tumor suppressor status."
https://openalex.org/W2077293808,"Fatty acid metabolism is perturbed in atherosclerotic lesions, but whether it affects lesion formation is unknown. To determine whether fatty acid synthesis affects atherosclerosis, we inactivated fatty-acid synthase (FAS) in macrophages of apoE-deficient mice. Serum lipids, body weight, and glucose metabolism were the same in FAS knock-out in macrophages (FASKOM) and control mice, but blood pressure was lower in FASKOM animals. Atherosclerotic extent was decreased 20-40% in different aortic regions of FASKOM as compared with control mice on Western diets. Foam cell formation was diminished in FASKOM as compared with wild type macrophages due to increased apoAI-specific cholesterol efflux and decreased uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein. Expression of the anti-atherogenic nuclear receptor liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha; Nr1h3) and its downstream targets, including Abca1, were increased in FASKOM macrophages, whereas expression of the potentially pro-atherogenic type B scavenger receptor CD36 was decreased. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) target gene expression was decreased in FASKOM macrophages. PPARalpha agonist treatment of FASKOM and wild type macrophages normalized PPARalpha target gene expression as well as Nr1h3 (LXRalpha). Atherosclerotic lesions were more extensive when apoE null mice were transplanted with LXRalpha-deficient/FAS-deficient bone marrow as compared with LXRalpha-replete/FAS-deficient marrow, consistent with anti-atherogenic effects of LXRalpha in the context of FAS deficiency. These results show that macrophage FAS deficiency decreases atherosclerosis through induction of LXRalpha and suggest that FAS, which is induced by LXRalpha, may generate regulatory lipids that cause feedback inhibition of LXRalpha in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2061275021,"West Nile virus, first identified within the United States in 1999, has since spread across the continental states and infected birds, humans and domestic animals, resulting in numerous deaths. Previous studies in mice identified the Oas1b gene, a member of the OAS/RNASEL innate immune system, as a determining factor for resistance to West Nile virus (WNV) infection. A recent case-control association study described mutations of human OAS1 associated with clinical susceptibility to WNV infection. Similar studies in horses, a particularly susceptible species, have been lacking, in part, because of the difficulty in collecting populations sufficiently homogenous in their infection and disease states. The equine OAS gene cluster most closely resembles the human cluster, with single copies of OAS1, OAS3 and OAS2 in the same orientation. With naturally occurring susceptible and resistant sub-populations to lethal West Nile encephalitis, we undertook a case-control association study to investigate whether, similar to humans (OAS1) and mice (Oas1b), equine OAS1 plays a role in resistance to severe WNV infection. We identified naturally occurring single nucleotide mutations in equine (Equus caballus) OAS1 and RNASEL genes and, using Fisher's Exact test, we provide evidence that mutations in equine OAS1 contribute to host susceptibility. Virtually all of the associated OAS1 polymorphisms were located within the interferon-inducible promoter, suggesting that differences in OAS1 gene expression may determine the host's ability to resist clinical manifestations associated with WNV infection."

However, the utility of these agents is limited by the frequent development of resistance, and the precise mechanisms underlying endocrine therapy resistance remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 is an important determinant of resistance to tamoxifen and show that Pin1 increases E2F-4- and Egr-1-driven expression of LC-3 as a result of an increased interaction with and phosphorylation of MEK1/2. In human tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, our results show a significant correlation between Pin1 overexpression and high levels of LC-3. Promoter activity as well as expression levels of Pin1 were drastically higher in tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cells than control MCF7 cells, as were levels of LC-3 mRNA and protein, an autophagy marker. Pin1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed lower 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced MEK1/2 phosphorylation than Pin1+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Silencing of Pin1 expression inhibited TPA-induced MEK1/2 phosphorylation in MCF7 cells. Moreover, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2, and juglone, a potent Pin1 inhibitor, significantly suppressed the TPA-induced expression of E2F-4 as well as Egr-1 transcription factors, which control LC-3 gene expression. Importantly, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, when used in combination with silencing of Pin1 or LC-3, increased cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA fragmentation to inhibit cologenic growth of MCF7 cells.

Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2002; 73: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, a significant fraction of these hormone-sensitive breast cancer patients will experience disease progression because of resistance to endocrine agents, such as tamoxifen, resulting in mortality (3Dawood S. Cristofanilli M. Ann. Oncol. 2007; 18: 1289-1291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Tamoxifen is currently the most widely prescribed, orally active, selective ER modulator for the treatment of breast cancer (4Riggs B.L. Hartmann L.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 618-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Although tamoxifen is an ER antagonist in breast tissue, it can also be a partial agonist. Antagonist activity enables the drug to block ER-mediated transcription and cancer cell growth in ER-positive breast cancer cells (5Oesterreich S. Zhang Q. Hopp T. Fuqua S.A. Michaelis M. Zhao H.H. Davie J.R. Osborne C.K. Lee A.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, tamoxifen resistance might occur when its agonistic activity overcomes its antagonistic effect (4Riggs B.L. Hartmann L.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 618-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). This variability could be related, in part, to the cellular milieu of ER co-activators and co-repressors (6Osborne C.K. Shou J. Massarweh S. Schiff R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 865s-870sPubMed Google Scholar). For example, increased levels of co-activators, such as SRC-3, enhance the estrogen agonist properties of tamoxifen, whereas decreased levels of co-repressors, such as SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors) and nuclear receptor corepressor, correlate with acquired tamoxifen resistance (6Osborne C.K.

Pin1 has two domains: a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase domain at its COOH terminus responsible for isomerization and a WW domain at the NH2 terminus, which functions as a binding element specific for Ser(P)/Thr-Pro motifs (7Lu K.P. Liou Y.C. Zhou X.Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 164-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Through these two domains, Pin1 binds to and isomerizes specific Ser(P)/Thr-Pro motifs and catalytically induces conformational changes after phosphorylation (7Lu K.P. Liou Y.C. Zhou X.Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 164-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Recently, Stanya et al. (8Stanya K.J. Liu Y. Means A.R. Kao H.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2)-mediated phosphorylation of SMRT, an ER co-repressor, creates a binding site for Pin1 peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase, which in turn induces conformational changes to promote SMRT degradation. Moreover, this event mediates human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-dependent SMRT protein degradation and resultant endocrine resistance (8Stanya K.J. Liu Y. Means A.R. Kao H.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings help elucidate the molecular mechanism of ER regulation and indicate that further investigation is needed for the role and therapeutic potential of Pin1 in the treatment of endocrine-resistant breast cancers. Here, we have determined for the first time a significant correlation between Pin1 overexpression and high levels of autophagy-related protein LC-3 in human tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. We found that Pin1 binds directly to MEK1/2 and regulates its activity, resulting in inducing the expression of E2F-4, Egr-1, and ultimately, LC-3 to affect tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells. Moreover, we show that 4-OH tamoxifen, when used in combination with silencing of Pin1 or LC-3, induces robust, caspase-dependent apoptosis of breast cancer cells. These results may have relevance to the development of tamoxifen resistance, as shown by the strong correlation, observed in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, between Pin1 overexpression and the presence of high levels of LC-3. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Eagle's minimal essential medium, l-glutamine, gentamicin, and FBS were purchased from Invitrogen. Charcoal/dextran-treated FBS was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and PD98059 were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. The Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Basal medium Eagle's, juglone, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-thiazoyl]-2,5-diphenylte-trazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The antibodies against phospho-MEK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, and total antibodies against MEK1/2, ERK1/2, Beclin-1, Atg-5, Atg-12, and LC-3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). The antibodies against Pin1, E2F-4, and Egr-1 were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Xpress antibody was obtained from Invitrogen. The anti-ErbB2 antibody was purchased from Dako Cytomation (Glostrup, Denmark). Breast cancer patients selected for immunohistochemical staining consisted of two groups: tamoxifen-resistant group (four patients, age range: 42–72) and non-tamoxifen-resistant group (eight patients, age range: 47–58). The eligibility for the tamoxifen-resistant group was mammary infiltrating duct carcinoma patient who had undergone mastectomy with adjuvant hormone therapy and subsequently had bone metastasis, and that for the non-tamoxifen-resistant group was mammary infiltrating duct carcinoma patient who had undergone mastectomy with adjuvant hormone therapy and subsequently had no local recurrence or metastasis within 5 years. All tumors investigated in the study were tested for LC-3 and Pin1. Immunolocalization for LC-3 and Pin1 was performed using a Polink-2 horseradish peroxidase plus anti-rabbit diaminobenzidine detection kit (Golden Bridge International, Inc., Mukilteo, WA) according to the supplier's protocol. Slides were incubated for 1 h with anti-Pin1 antibody and overnight with anti-LC-3 antibody, respectively. An isotype-matched control antibody was also used. Positive control for LC-3 was capsaicin-treated WI38 cell, and those for Pin1 were mammary infiltrating duct carcinoma with strong nuclear staining in another study. Instead of the primary antibody, normal goat serum was used in negative control. Distinct nuclear staining was considered as positive immunoreactivity. MCF7 human breast cancer cells and Pin1+/+ and Pin1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, which were kindly provided by Dr. Kun Ping Lu (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School), were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. DMEM containing 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS and 3 μm 4-OH tamoxifen were used to culture the tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells (TAMR-MCF7), which were provided by Dr. Keon Wook Kang (College of Pharmacy, Chosun University). The cDNA of the full sequence of Pin1, which was a gift from Dr. Kun Ping Lu, were subcloned to the pcDNA4/Xpress vector (Invitrogen). A segment encoding the full sequence of MEK1 was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into the BamHI/XbaI sites of the pCMV-HA (Clontech) or pGEX-5X-1 (GE Healthcare) vector to produce the plasmid pCMV-HA-MEK1 or pGEX-5X-1-MEK1, respectively. All MEK1 deletion mutants (pGEX-5X-1-D1, -D2, or D3) were generated from pGEX-5X-1-MEK1 by PCR and subcloned in-frame into the BamHI/XbaI sites of pGEX-5X-1 vector, respectively. The silencing of human Pin1 (accession number: NM_006221), human LC-3 (accession number: NM_022818), human E2F-4 (NM_001950), and human Egr-1 (NM_001964) was performed by transfecting the ON-TARGETplus siRNA SMART pool-specific or nonspecific control pool double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). Pin1 was overexpressed stably in MCF7 cells using the MSCV-GFP retrovirus system. Human Pin1 was subcloned into the MSCV-GFP retroviral vector (Clontech Inc.), and phoenix cells (a packaging cell line) were transfected with the MSCV-GFP or MSCV-Pin1-GFP plasmids. The supernatants containing amphotropic, replication-incompetent retroviruses were collected and stored at −80 °C until needed. MCF7 cells (20% confluent) were multiply infected (eight times) with retrovirus particles. Cells seeded on 96-well microplates at 10,000 cells/well were incubated with 4-OH tamoxifen for the indicated times. The respective medium was removed and then incubated with MTT solution (5 μg/ml) for 3 h. Absorbance was determined using a microplate reader. Cells were disrupted in immunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) or radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) and subjected to the immunoblotting. Pin1 promoter luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were co-transfected with a plasmid mixture containing the Pin1 promoter luciferase reporter gene (a gift from Dr. Kun Ping Lu) with the phRL-SV40 gene (Promega). At 48 h after transfection, firefly luciferase activity was measured using a GloMax®-Multi detection system (Promega). Subsequently, Renilla luciferase activity was measured to normalize the firefly luciferase data. Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy® micro kit(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using the AcessQuick RT-PCR system (Promega, WI) on an MJ MiniTM gradient thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) using the following PCR primers: human LC-3 (sense, 5′-AGCAGCATCCAACCAAAATC-3′; antisense, 5′-CTGTGTCCGTTCACCAACAG-3′), human Pin1 (sense, 5′-AGCAGCAGTGGTGGCAAAAA-3′; antisense, 5′-GGCCAGAGACTCAAAGTCCT-3), and β-actin (Promega), respectively. All data were normalized to β-actin as an internal control according to the manufacturer's instructions. For expression of the Xpress epitope-tagged Pin1, the appropriate plasmids (pcDNA4/Xpress-Pin1) were translated in vitro with l-methionine using the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). For the GST pulldown assay, 5 μg of GST fusion protein of MEK1 and deletion mutants were collected on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with Xpress-Pin1. The bound proteins were denatured in sample buffer and separated by 10–20% SDS-PAGE, and expression was detected by immunoblotting. An apoptosis assay was performed by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling, and apoptosis was detected with an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were transfected with siRNA-sc, siRNA-Pin1, or siRNA-LC-3 and incubated for 48 h. The cells were then starved with serum-free DMEM for 24 h and treated with tamoxifen for an additional 24 h. Then, cells were stained with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling solution and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted with crystal mount reagent for 4 h in the dark. The amount of DNA fragmentation was detected by using an Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope and AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). The induction of early and late apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). TAMR-MCF7 cells (5 × 105/dish), were grown in 6-cm dishes for 24 h in 10% FBS/DMEM. Then, cells were transfected with siRNA-sc or -Pin1, incubated for 48 h, and then treated with 4-OH tamoxifen. After additional incubation for 24 h, the medium was collected, and attached cells were harvested with 0.025% trypsin in 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were washed by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and processed for detection of early and late apoptosis using annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide staining according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells (8 × 103) were exposed to PD98058 or juglone with or without TPA in 1 ml of 0.3% basal Eagle's agar containing 10% FBS. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C for 10–15 days, and the cell colonies were scored using an Axiovert 200 M florescence microscope and AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss Inc.). The Fisher's exact test (two-sided values of probability (p) are given) was used to analyze the correlation between Pin1 expression and the level of LC-3 in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer patients. Data from cell viability, promoter activity, RT-PCR, or soft agar assay were statistically analyzed using unpaired t test, and p values <0.05 were considered to be significant. Statistical calculations were carried out with Prism 4 for Macintosh software (GraphPad Software. Inc., La Jolla, CA). To investigate the pathological relevance of the relationship between Pin1 and LC-3 expression in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers, we analyzed these two proteins in eight human non-tamoxifen-resistant and four human tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer tissue samples. Immunohistochemical staining showed that there was a positive correlation between the levels of LC-3 and Pin1 in human tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer samples as tumors with high levels of LC-3 (in three of four samples) also had high levels of Pin1 protein levels (in all four samples) in tamoxifen-resistant cancers, whereas low levels of LC-3 (in seven of the eight samples) were paralleled by low levels of Pin1 (in seven of the eight samples) in non-tamoxifen-resistant cancers (p < 0.010, Fisher's exact test; Fig. 1A). To further examine whether Pin1 or LC-3 facilitates the development of antiestrogen resistance, we did a drug selection in which MCF7 cells were exposed to small, incremental increases of 4-OH tamoxifen. The stepwise drug selection was continued until the MCF7 cell population could sustain viability and proliferate when challenged with 3.0 μm 4-OH tamoxifen. The acquisition of 4-OH tamoxifen resistance in TAMR-MCF7 cells was verified using an MTT assay. 4-OH tamoxifen caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the cell viability of MCF7 cells but not TAMR-MCF7 up to 5 μm (Fig. 1B). To examine the effects on Pin1 promoter activity, MCF7 or TAMR-MCF7 cells were transfected with mixtures of the Pin1 promoter luciferase construct and phRL-SV-40 gene. The promoter activity of Pin1 was significantly increased in TAMR-MCF7 cells when compared with MCF7 cells (Fig. 1C, upper panels). Pin1 expression was higher in TAMR-MCF7 cells than in MCF7 cells in immunoblots (Fig. 1C, lower panels). These results suggested that Pin1 is likely to be involved in tamoxifen resistance of MCF7 cells. To determine whether autophagy proteins affect tamoxifen resistance, we next monitored the expression levels of autophagy proteins in TAMR-MCF7 cells. TAMR-MCF7 cells showed higher levels of LC-3 and, to a lesser extent, Beclin-1, ATG5, and ATG12 than control MCF7 cells (Fig. 1D, right lane). To further confirm whether overexpression of LC-3 in TAMR-MCF7 cells is affected by Pin1, pcDNA4/Xpress-Pin1 were transfected into MCF7 cells, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. Pin1-overexpressing MCF7 cells showed increased levels of LC-3 (Fig. 1D, middle lane). To examine the effect of Pin1 on the expression level of LC-3, which is an autophagy marker, we then analyzed mRNA levels of LC-3 followed by overexpression of Pin1 in MCF7 cells or knockdown of Pin1 in TAMR-MCF7 cells, respectively. Semiquantitative RT-PCR results showed that LC-3 mRNA level was increased by up to 5-fold in Pin1-overexpressing MCF7 cells when compared with MCF7 cells, whereas the increased LC-3 mRNA level in TAMR-MCF7 cells significantly decreased with knockdown of Pin1 (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these data suggest that Pin1-mediated overexpression of LC-3 may be responsible for the 4-OH tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. Activation of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling induced by TPA plays an important role in autophagy (9Mishima Y. Terui Y. Mishima Y. Taniyama A. Kuniyoshi R. Takizawa T. Kimura S. Ozawa K. Hatake K. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 2200-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Additionally, the inhibition of autophagy accelerates imatinib-induced cell death of imatinib-resistant cells (9Mishima Y. Terui Y. Mishima Y. Taniyama A. Kuniyoshi R. Takizawa T. Kimura S. Ozawa K. Hatake K. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 2200-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine whether MAPK signaling affects tamoxifen resistance, we monitored the activity of MAPK proteins in MCF7 and TAMR-MCF7 cells. TAMR-MCF7 cells showed a marked increase in MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation as well as LC-3 and Pin1 when compared with control MCF7 cells (Fig. 2A). To confirm the interaction between Pin1 and MEK1, we next co-transfected HA-tagged MEK1 with Xpress-tagged Pin1 or Pin1 mutant affecting the WW domain (S16A) in HEK 293 cells. The cells lysates were immunoprecipitated using the normal IgG or anti-HA antibody, respectively, and blotted with the anti-Xpress antibody. The results showed that the exogenously expressed MEK1 only bound to the wild-type Pin1 but not to the Pin1 S16A mutant affecting the WW domain (Fig. 2B). To determine the region of MEK1 that was responsible for its interaction with Pin1, GST fusion protein of full-length MEK1 (MEK1-WT) or each of respective MEK1 deletion fragments (MEK1-D1, -D2, -D3) was incubated with in vitro translated Pin1, respectively, and the interaction was examined by GST pulldown assay. The results suggested that residues 68–330 of MEK1, which is included in the Ser/Thr kinase domain, were required for its interaction with Pin1 (Fig. 2C). Next, we examined the time course analysis for the TPA-induced interaction of Pin1 and MEK1/2 in MCF7 cells. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting showed that Pin1 was detectable in MEK1/2 immunoprecipitates from 5 to 15 min after TPA treatment (Fig. 2D). To assess whether MAPK signaling was regulated by Pin1, we exposed Pin1+/+ and Pin1−/− MEF cells to TPA and immunoblotted with antibodies against phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2. We found significantly decreased phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in Pin1−/− MEF cells when compared with Pin1+/+ MEF cells (Fig. 2E). Next, to determine whether knockdown of Pin1 suppresses the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 induced by TPA, we transfected small interfering RNA (siRNA) for Pin1 or control siRNA in MCF7 cells. TPA induced less phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in Pin1 knockdown cells (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these data indicate that Pin1 enhanced the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 as well as ERK1/2 induced by TPA, resulting from its interaction with MEK1/2, and suggest that Pin1-enhanced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 may regulate a high level of LC-3. Resistance associated with the activated ErbB system in breast cancer cells is reversed by inhibiting MAPK or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling (10Ghayad S.E. Vendrell J.A. Larbi S.B. Dumontet C. Bieche I. Cohen P.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2010; 126: 545-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In fact, targeting the ErbB2 pathway through blocking antibodies (Herceptin) has been suggested in the context of tamoxifen resistance based on the link between activation of growth factor signaling pathways and estrogen-independent tumor growth (11Clarke R. Liu M.C. Bouker K.B. Gu Z. Lee R.Y. Zhu Y. Skaar T.C. Gomez B. O'Brien K. Wang Y. Hilakivi-Clarke L.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7316-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). As expected, TAMR-MCF7 cells showed a high level of ErbB2 when compared with control MCF7 cells, similarly to Pin1 (Fig. 3A). Given the role of Pin1 in activating MEK1/2 (Fig. 2), we further determined whether ablation or knockdown of Pin1 suppresses the ErbB2 expression induced by tumor promoters, such as TPA. Therefore, we exposed Pin1+/+ and Pin1−/− MEF cells to TPA and performed immunoblotting with an antibody against ErbB2. Pin1−/− MEF showed significantly lower ErbB2 levels than Pin1+/+ MEF cells treated with TPA in a dose-dependent analysis (Fig. 3B, upper panels) and time-dependent analysis (Fig. 3B, lower panels). To confirm the effect of Pin1 knockdown on the ErbB2 expression induced by TPA, we transfected siRNA-Pin1 or siRNA-sc (control) in MCF7 cells and then performed immunoblotting with antibodies against ErbB2 and Pin1. TPA-induced ErbB2 expression was significantly suppressed in siRNA-Pin1-transfected cells when compared with siRNA-sc-transfected cells (Fig. 3C). Similarly, pretreatment with PD98059, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, or juglone, a Pin1-specific inhibitor (12Chao S.H. Greenleaf A.L. Price D.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), dramatically decreased TPA-induced ErbB2 expression (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results indicate that Pin1 regulates TPA-induced ErbB2 expression in MCF7 cells through enhancing MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. E2F-4 and Egr-1 regulate LC-3 transcription and may be novel targets for regulating autophagy in mammalian systems (13Chen Z.H. Kim H.P. Sciurba F.C. Lee S.J. Feghali-Bostwick C. Stolz D.B. Dhir R. Landreneau R.J. Schuchert M.J. Yousem S.A. Nakahira K. Pilewski J.M. Lee J.S. Zhang Y. Ryter S.W. Choi A.M. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Pin1 is necessary for E2F-4 and Egr-1 to induce LC-3. As expected, E2F-4 and Egr-1 levels were higher in TAMR-MCF7 cells than MCF7 cells, consistent with high LC-3 and Pin1 levels (Fig. 4A). Similarly, TPA could induce E2F-4 and Egr-1 expression in Pin1+/+ MEF cells but not in Pin1−/− MEF cells (Fig. 4B). Finally, the siRNA-Pin1, but not the siRNA-sc, blocked TPA-induced E2F-4 and Egr-1 expression (Fig. 4C). juglone (Fig. 4D, left panel) and PD98059 (Fig. 4D, right panel) dose dependently decreased TPA-induced expression of E2F-4 and Egr-1. Next, we determined the effect of knockdown of E2F-4 or Egr-1 on the TPA-induced LC-3, respectively. Interestingly, these results showed that both E2F-4 and Egr-1 are essential for the TPA-induced expression of LC-3 in MCF7 cells (Fig. 4E). Therefore, we further examined whether ablation of the E2F-4 or Egr-1 gene in Pin1-overexpressing MCF7 cells (MSCV-Pin1) affects the LC-3 levels induced by TPA. MSCV-Pin1 cells were transfected with siRNA-sc, -E2F-4, or -Egr-1, respectively, and then either treated or not treated with TPA. The results showed that TPA markedly induced the LC-3 expression in MSCV-Pin1 cells when compared with MSCV-GFP cells, whereas knockdown of E2F-4 or Egr-1 in MSCV-Pin1 cells suppressed TPA-induced LC-3 expression when compared with siRNA-sc-transfected MSCV-Pin1 cells (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these results strongly support our notion that the regulation of MEK1/2 by Pin1 is critical for regulating LC-3 expression via increases in transcriptional factors E2F-4 and Egr-1. We next tested whether Pin1 and LC-3 knockdown would potentiate tamoxifen-induced cell death. 4-OH tamoxifen treatment reduced MCF7 cell viability by 20%, whereas Pin1 knockdown with siRNA produced almost complete sensitivity (Fig. 5A, open circles), as did LC-3 knockdown (Fig. 5A, black triangle) in MTT assays. To further examine whether ablation of the LC-3 gene in Pin1-overexpressing MCF7 cells affects tamoxifen sensitivity, we next transfected siRNA-sc or -LC-3 i"
https://openalex.org/W2011782300,"Earlier studies have shown both p53-dependent and -independent tumor-suppressive functions of B56γ-specific protein phosphatase 2A (B56γ–PP2A). In the absence of p53, B56γ–PP2A can inhibit cell proliferation and cell transformation by an unknown mechanism. In the presence of p53, on DNA damage, a complex including B56γ–PP2A and p53 is formed, which leads to Thr55 dephosphorylation of p53, induction of the p53 transcriptional target p21 and inhibition of cell proliferation. In spite of its significance in inhibition of cell proliferation, no B56γ mutations have been linked to human cancer to date. In this study, we first differentiate between the p53-dependent and -independent functions of B56γ–PP2A by identifying a domain of the B56γ protein required for interaction with p53. Within this region, we identify a B56γ mutation, F395C, in lung cancer that disrupts the B56γ–p53 interaction. More importantly, we show that F395C is unable to promote p53 Thr55 dephosphorylation, transcriptional activation of p21 and the p53-dependent tumor-suppressive function of PP2A. This finding provides a mechanistic basis for the p53-dependent and -independent functions of B56γ–PP2A and establishes a critical link between B56γ–PP2A p53-dependent tumor-suppressive function and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1986979664,"Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is a key element in the DNA-damage response pathway that is required for maintaining genomic stability. To study the potential role of Chk1 in mammary tumorigenesis, we disrupted it using a Cre/loxP system. We showed that although Chk1 heterozygosity caused abnormal development of the mammary gland, it was not sufficient to induce tumorigenesis. Simultaneous deletion of one copy of p53 failed to rescue the developmental defects; however, it synergistically induced mammary tumor formation in Chk1(+/-);MMTV-Cre animals with a median time to tumor latency of about 10 months. Chk1 deficiency caused a preponderance of abnormalities, including prolongation, multipolarity, misalignment, mitotic catastrophe and loss of spindle checkpoint, that are accompanied by reduced expression of several cell cycle regulators, including Mad2. On the other hand, we also showed that Chk1 deficiency inhibited mammary tumor formation in mice carrying a homozygous deletion of p53, uncovering a complex relationship between Chk1 and p53. Furthermore, inhibition of Chk1 with a specific inhibitor, SB-218078, or acute deletion of Chk1 using small hairpin RNA killed mammary tumor cells effectively. These data show that Chk1 is critical for maintaining genome integrity and serves as a double-edged sword for cancer: although its inhibition kills cancer cells, it also triggers tumorigenesis when favorable mutations are accumulated for cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W2151324441,"Despite apparently abundant amounts of observable variation and species diversity, the order Lepidoptera exhibits a morphological homogeneity that has provided only a limited number of taxonomic characters and led to widespread use of nucleotides for inferring relationships. This study aims to characterize and develop methods to quantify the value of priority gene regions designated for Lepidoptera molecular systematics. In particular, I assess how the DNA barcode segment of the mitochondrial COI gene performs across a broad temporal range given its number one position of priority, most sequenced status, and the conflicting opinions on its phylogenetic performance.Gene regions commonly sequenced for lepidoptera phylogenetics were scored using multiple measures across three categories: practicality, which includes universality of primers and sequence quality; phylogenetic utility; and phylogenetic signal. I found that alternative measures within a category often appeared correlated, but high scores in one category did not necessarily translate into high scores in another. The DNA barcode was easier to sequence than other genes, and had high scores for utility but low signal above the genus level.Given limited financial resources and time constraints, careful selection of gene regions for molecular phylogenetics is crucial to avoid wasted effort producing partially informative data. This study introduces an approach to assessing the value of gene regions prior to the initiation of new studies and presents empirical results to help guide future selections."
https://openalex.org/W2024715735,"Ca(V)beta subunits modulate cell surface expression and voltage-dependent gating of high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca(V)1 and Ca(V)2 alpha1 subunits. High affinity Ca(V)beta binding onto the so-called alpha interaction domain of the I-II linker of the Ca(V)alpha1 subunit is required for Ca(V)beta modulation of HVA channel gating. It has been suggested, however, that Ca(V)beta-mediated plasma membrane targeting could be uncoupled from Ca(V)beta-mediated modulation of channel gating. In addition to Ca(V)beta, Ca(V)alpha2delta and calmodulin have been proposed to play important roles in HVA channel targeting. Indeed we show that co-expression of Ca(V)alpha2delta caused a 5-fold stimulation of the whole cell currents measured with Ca(V)1.2 and Ca(V)beta3. To gauge the synergetic role of auxiliary subunits in the steady-state plasma membrane expression of Ca(V)1.2, extracellularly tagged Ca(V)1.2 proteins were quantified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Co-expression of Ca(V)1.2 with either Ca(V)alpha2delta, calmodulin wild type, or apocalmodulin (alone or in combination) failed to promote the detection of fluorescently labeled Ca(V)1.2 subunits. In contrast, co-expression with Ca(V)beta3 stimulated plasma membrane expression of Ca(V)1.2 by a 10-fold factor. Mutations within the alpha interaction domain of Ca(V)1.2 or within the nucleotide kinase domain of Ca(V)beta3 disrupted the Ca(V)beta3-induced plasma membrane targeting of Ca(V)1.2. Altogether, these data support a model where high affinity binding of Ca(V)beta to the I-II linker of Ca(V)alpha1 largely accounts for Ca(V)beta-induced plasma membrane targeting of Ca(V)1.2."
https://openalex.org/W2076969615,"Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) channels are the main pathway of Ca(2+) entry in non-excitable cells such as neural progenitor cells (NPCs). However, the role of SOCE channels has not been defined in the neuronal differentiation from NPCs. Here, we show that canonical transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) as SOCE channel influences the induction of the neuronal differentiation of A2B5(+) NPCs isolated from postnatal-12-day rat cerebrums. The amplitudes of SOCE were significantly higher in neural cells differentiated from proliferating A2B5(+) NPCs and applications of SOCE blockers, 2-aminoethoxy-diphenylborane (2-APB), and ruthenium red (RR), inhibited their rise of SOCE. Among TRPC subtypes (TRPC1-7), marked expression of TRPC5 and TRPC6 with turned-off TRPC1 expression was observed in neuronal cells differentiated from proliferating A2B5(+) NPCs. TRPC5 small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked the neuronal differentiation from A2B5(+) NPCs and reduced the rise of SOCE. In contrast, TRPC6 siRNA had no significant effect on the neuronal differentiation from A2B5(+) NPCs. These results indicate that calcium regulation by TRPC5 would play a key role as a switch between proliferation and neuronal differentiation from NPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2091510602,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-activated channels expressed in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems where they modulate neuronal activity in response to external increases in proton concentration. The size of ASIC1 currents evoked by a given local acidification is determined by the number of channels in the plasma membrane and by the apparent proton affinities for activation and steady-state desensitization of the channel. Thus, the magnitude of the pH drop and the value of the baseline pH both are functionally important. Recent characterization of ASIC1s from an increasing number of species has made evident that proton affinities of these channels vary across vertebrates. We found that in species with high baseline plasma pH, e.g. frog, shark, and fish, ASIC1 has high proton affinity compared with the mammalian channel. The β1-β2 linker in the extracellular domain, specifically by the substitution M85L, determines the interspecies differences in proton affinities and also the time course of ASIC1 macroscopic currents. The mechanism underlying these observations is a delay in channel opening after application of protons, most likely by stabilizing a closed conformation that decreases the apparent affinity to protons and also slows the rise and decay phases of the current. Together, the results suggest evolutionary adaptation of ASIC1 to match the value of the species-specific plasma pH.

Three identical or homologous subunits associate to form functional channels (4.Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Each subunit has a large extracellular domain that contains the proton sensor. The identity and location of the proton sensor remain elusive, but it is generally accepted that ionizable residues, most likely negatively charged, constitute the proton binding sites that control opening of the channel. Two properties define the magnitude of the ASIC1 response to changes in the concentration of external protons. These are the proton affinity for half-maximal activation or pH50A, and the proton affinity for half-maximal steady-state desensitization or pH50D. The value of the former determines the size of the peak current evoked by a rapid increase in the concentration of external protons, whereas the latter determines the fraction of channels available for activation at any given resting pH. In mammals, the pH50A of ASIC1 is in the range of 6.4 to 6.6, and the pH50D is ∼7.2 (5.Alvarez de la Rosa D. Zhang P. Shao D. White F. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2326-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The steady-state desensitization of the mammalian ASIC1 exhibits a high degree of cooperativity to protons with a Hill coefficient ≥6; thus, a small decrease in external pH such as 0.1 units can lead to inactivation of as much as 80% of channels. These observations underscore the importance of baseline pH in determining the magnitude of the ASIC1 response to local acidification. However, physiological values of baseline external pH are not the same in all vertebrates but spread over a wide range from 7.38 to 8.0, raising the question of whether species with high plasma pH control ASIC1 responses in the same way as mammals. Although, in general, species with high plasma pH also have lower temperature, lower partial pressure of CO2, and lower sodium concentration than mammals (6.Burton R.F. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 641-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all of which change the degree of ionization of water and of charged groups in proteins, it remains to be shown whether the compound effect of those factors is sufficient to render the ASIC1 response to equivalent levels across species. In this work, we examined the proton response of ASIC1 from two species with high arterial pH: frog and elephant shark. We found indeed that ASIC1s from these species have higher proton affinities than the mammalian channel and that residues underlying the differences in proton affinities are in the β1-β2 linker of the extracellular domain rather than in the proton sensor. The mechanism consists in stabilization of a closed conformation by the β1-β2 linker specifically; the substitution M85L decreases the apparent proton affinity and slows the rise and decay phases of the currents by delaying channel openings. Cloning of ASICs were conducted by a combination of RT-PCR and 5′ and 3′ extension as described previously (7.Coric T. Zheng D. Gerstein M. Canessa C.M. J. Physiol. 2005; 568: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from frog brain with TRIzol reagent and used for synthesis of single strand cDNA with SuperReverse transcriptase III (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) priming. The full-length cDNAs were ligated into pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen), which added a V5 epitope tag at the C terminus. High fidelity Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) was used in all experiments. DNA of eight independent clones from two different RT-PCR reactions were sequenced in both directions by the Keck facility at Yale University. Elephant shark ASIC was cloned by RT-PCR from a brain cDNA library provided by Dr. Byrappa Venkatesh (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Biopolis). We used specific N and C termini DNA primers designed to match sequences from the DNA genomic data bank of elephant shark (8.Venkatesh B. Kirkness E.F. Loh Y.H. Halpern A.L. Lee A.P. Johnson J.

The use of frogs was in accordance to guidelines approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Yale University. Point mutations were introduced into cDNAs using QuikChange (Agilent). All products were sequenced to confirm the presence of mutations. Fifteen oocytes per conditions were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) on ice. After lysis of cells with 1% Triton X-100, the biotinylated proteins were recovered with streptavidin beads (Pierce). The beads were washed with 1% Triton X-100 and 300 mm NaCl. Biotinylated proteins were eluted from beads, resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon). ASIC was detected with anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Signals were developed with ECL+ (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak). Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 5 ng cRNA in a volume of 50 nl and were incubated at 16 °C for 2–3 days. For two-electrode voltage clamp experiments, oocytes were placed in a recording chamber (400 μl) perfused by gravity at a rate of 4 ml/min. Oocytes were impaled with two glass microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl having resistance <1 megohm. Membrane potential was held at −60 mV, and whole-cell currents were recorded with a clamp OC-725B (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) and digitized at a sampling rate of 2 kHz (PowerLab 4/30, ADInstruments). Composition of the standard bath solution was as follows: 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 15 mm HEPES-MES. The pH was adjusted to obtain a series of solutions differing by 0.1 pH units from pH 8.0 to 5.0. The same set of solutions was used for all experiments to minimize variations owing to calibration of pH. All experiments were conducted at room temperature. Apparent proton affinities were calculated with Equation 1 as shown below.I=1/(1+(EC50/[H+])n)(Eq. 1) Time constants for the rise and decay phases were obtained by fitting the time course of currents to the function (Equation 2),I(t)=Io[exp⁡(t/τd)−exp⁡(t/τa)(Eq. 2) where Io is a scaling factor. Patch pipettes were pulled from PG150T glass (Warner Instruments) to a tip diameter of 2–5 μm after heat polishing. Pipette solution was as follows: 120 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES titrated with KOH to pH 7.4. Bath and activating solutions were as follows: 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 15 mm HEPES-MES titrated from pH 8.0 to 5.0. Activating solutions were applied using a modified Perfusion Fast Step device SF-77B (Warner Instruments) onto which eight perfusion pipettes were mounted. The data acquisition program Pulse in turn controlled the SF-77B. Time resolution of the solution exchange device is 0.5 ms as described previously (9.Zhang P. Sigworth F.J. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recordings were made using a EPC-9 amplifier and the Pulse acquisition program (HEKA Electronic). Membrane potential was held at −60 mV. Experiments were conducted at room temperature. We cloned two cDNAs from brain X. laevis that are 94% identical and encode proteins that differ only in 17 out of 525 amino acids, including one deletion. The relation of the frog proteins to other ASICs is shown in the tree of Fig. 1A, and the amino acid sequences are presented in supplemental Fig. 1A. We refer to the frog proteins as xASIC1.1 and xASIC1.2. They are products of different genes and not the result of differential splicing because the amino acid differences are scattered in the whole cDNA rather than being restricted to one exon. The presence of two copies of the same gene and expression of the corresponding proteins in brain of X. laevis is the consequence of a previous tetraploidization event dated ∼30 million years ago (10.Hughes M.K. Hughes A.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 1360-1369PubMed Google Scholar). The protein cloned from elephant shark, Callorhinchus milii, (8.Venkatesh B. Kirkness E.F. Loh Y.H. Halpern A.L. Lee A.P. Johnson J. Dandona N. Viswanathan L.D. Tay A. Venter J.C. Strausberg R.L. Brenner S. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e101Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) is 79% identical to frog and 77% identical to rat ASIC1a and corresponds also to ASIC1 as indicated in Fig. 1A. The amino acid sequence is shown in supplemental Fig. 1A. Expression of xASIC1.1 and xASIC1.2 in oocytes produced inward currents evoked by pH 6.0 of mean peak amplitude 20 ± 7 μA/cell (n = 44). The magnitude and time course of currents from the two channels were indistinguishable. Fig. 1B shows representative examples of whole-cell currents of xASIC1.1 and xASIC1.2 evoked by increasing concentrations of protons from pH 7.2 to 6.0. The apparent proton affinity for activation (pH50A) was measured by preconditioning cells with pH 8.0 followed by stimuli of pH 7.2 to 5.5. The apparent proton affinity for activation was calculated with the peak currents giving values for pH50A of 7.0 and a Hill coefficient of 3. (Fig. 1C). The apparent affinity of protons for steady-state desensitization pH50D, i.e. desensitization from the closed state, was measured by lowering the preconditioning pH by 0.1 units starting from pH 8.0 to 6.8. The calculated pH50D had values of 7.8 for both xASIC1.1 and xASIC1.2. To contrast the differences with rat ASIC1a, the graph in Fig. 1C also shows the corresponding proton affinities of rat ASIC1a measured under identical conditions: pH50D 7.2 and pH50A 6.3. Thus, frog ASIC1 has higher affinity for protons than the mammalian ASIC1 channel. The determinants of proton sensitivity of ASIC1 currently are not known, but it usually is assumed that differences in charged residues in the extracellular domain underlie the variations in proton affinities. Comparison of negatively and positively charged amino acids of frog and rat ASIC1 proteins showed a high degree of conservation, suggesting that ionizable residues do not account for the differences in proton sensitivity. We examined instead the β1-β2 linker that is a short segment in the extracellular domain that connects the β1 with the β2 strands. We have shown previously that the β1-β2 linker plays an essential role in conferring proton sensitivity to lamprey ASIC1 (11.Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2010; (in press)Google Scholar) and also modifies the rate of decay of fish ASIC1 currents (12.Coric T. Zhang P. Todorovic N. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45240-45247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition of the β1-β2 linker of xASIC1.1 is Pro83-Lys84-Met85, whereas that of rat ASIC1a is Ser83-Gln84-Leu85 (Fig. 1D). These three residues were substituted in frog to generate the triple mutant xASIC1.1-P83S-K84Q-M85L (SQL). The mutations decreased proton affinity for steady-state desensitization; the apparent pH50D was shifted from 7.8 to 7.35, whereas the pH50A changed from 7.0 to 7.1 (Fig. 1E). These results were duplicated by the single substitution M85L, indicating that position 85 is the main contributor of the three residues in the β1-β2 linker. Macroscopic currents of xASIC1.1 rapidly increase and decay upon proton stimulation. Fig. 2A contrasts the time course of normalized frog and rat ASIC1a (rASIC1a) currents evoked by pH 6.8 recorded under identical conditions. Frog and rat channels completely desensitize in the continuous presence of external protons, but both the rise and the decay phases are faster in xASIC1.1 than in rASIC1. Analysis of xASIC1.1 mutants showed that the substitutions in the β1-β2 linker also slow channel kinetics. Traces in Fig. 2B are normalized currents evoked by pH 7.1 in xASIC1.1 wild type and channels bearing single substitutions: P83S, K84Q, M85L, or three substitutions together: P83S-K84Q-M85L. To discern the effect of individual mutations on the rise phase of the currents, the same traces are presented in an expanded time scale (Fig. 2C). Of the three single substitutions, M85L has the largest effect, but together, they produce a further small additive effect. To examine whether other residues have a similar effect in position 85, we tested the amino acids indicated in Table 1. Currents of single mutants were examined at pH 7.1. The time constants for the rise (τa) and the decay phases (τd) were derived from the fit of whole-cell currents to Equation 2. Only leucine slowed the currents; all other residues either did not change significantly the time constants or decreased the values, threonine and phenylalanine. Currents produced by M85R were too small to be examined.TABLE 1Time constants of xASIC1.1 mutantsCurrent (mean ± S.D.)No. of cellsτa (mean ± S.D.)τd (mean ± S.D.)μA/cellnmsmsWild type Xenopus3 ± 0.72440 ± 8180 ± 30S83Q84L8510 ± 426230 ± 283100 ± 350P83S4 ± 0.8952 ± 3260 ± 40K84Q1.8 ± 0.4851 ± 4270 ± 30M85L9 ± 0.1125220 ± 202920 ± 180M85T0.8 ± 0.41112 ± 270 ± 13M85F1.1 ± 0.2511 ± 365 ± 20M85C2.8 + 0.4642 ± 82222 ± 40M85A1.5 ± 0.3540 ± 3190 ± 30M85R0.2 ± 0.112NDND Open table in a new tab To investigate the mechanism underlying the functional changes produced by substitutions in the β1-β2 linker, we examined xASIC1.1 wild type and the mutant SQL in outside-out patches exposed sequentially to a series of activating solutions with increasing concentrations of protons (pH 7.4, 7.3, 7.2, 7.1, 7.0, 6.8, and 6.0). From wild type xASIC1.1, we recorded 10 to 20 sweeps of 4-s exposure to the activating pH and 8-s recovery at pH 8.0. For mutant channels, owing to the slow time course of the currents, the duration of the sweeps was lengthened to a 20-s exposure to activating pH, followed by a 10-s recovery. Representative examples of xASIC1.1 wild type (Fig. 3A) and xASIC1.1-SQL (Fig. 3B) currents evoked by increasing concentration of protons show the slow time course of the mutant currents compared with wild type particularly in the pH range from 7.3 to 7.1. Time constants of activation τa and desensitization τd calculated at several proton concentrations are presented in Table 2. The constants exhibit proton dependence in the pH range from 7.3 to 6.0. At pH ≤ 6.0, the τa reached a maximal value without further decrease, suggesting that at very high concentrations of protons, when diffusion rate is not a factor, the activation rate saturates in both channels.TABLE 2Proton dependence of time constants of wild type xASIC1.1, SQL mutant, and rat ASIC1apHxASIC1.1xASIC1.1-SQLrASIC1aτaτdτaτdτaτdmsMsms7.25225021510,2007.13113017825006.812656080018024806.022521001017005.51.5181.5506670 Open table in a new tab Analysis of patches indicates that the fraction of channels opening late after application of the stimulus and the length of the delay decreased as the concentration of protons increased (Fig. 3, C and D). At very high proton concentrations, pH ≤6.5, almost all channels open immediately after the stimulus producing a sharp increase in the inward current and reducing the duration of the sweep, black traces in Fig. 3, A and B. The main difference observed in the mutant ASIC1.1-SQL is a larger delay in first openings (Fig. 3D) that markedly broadens the peak current and slows the time course of the current produced by the ensemble of channels. Consequently, it increases the values of both τa and τd constants. To understand the effect of the β1-β2 linker in the reaction cycle of ASIC1, we considered the simplest scheme with two shut states: closed protonated (CH) and desensitized (DH) and one open state (OH) (Fig. 4A). Because desensitization occurs without channel opening, the reaction is written in a cyclical form. The arrows represent the rate constants that lead to or leave the state. Frog and rat ASIC1 completely desensitize in the continuous presence of protons; thus, the rate constant δ is assumed to be negligible as channels move irreversibly from the open to an absorbing desensitized state (9.Zhang P. Sigworth F.J. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mean open times τo of wild type and mutant channels were calculated by fitting histograms of the duration of OH to single exponentials (Fig. 4, B and C). Values of τo were not significantly different, 6.8 versus 4.5 ms for wild type and mutant; thus, we conclude that stability of the open state and therefore the rate constants that leave OH (β and γ) are not significantly modified by mutations in the β1-β2 linker. We next examined whether the mutation M85L decreases the value of the transition rate α. The opening rate of the ensemble of channels in the patch (1/τa) is a function of both α and of the fraction of channels in the CH state, which, in turn, increase with the concentration of protons. Table 2 shows steep proton dependence of τa in the range of pH ≥6.0 and larger values of τa for the mutant than for wild type. However, at high concentration of protons, τa reached the similar minimum value in both channels ∼2 ms. Fig. 4D shows the rising phase of normalized currents (average of 10 sweeps) of patches containing mutant channels (continuous lines) activated by pH 6.5, 6.0, and 5.0 and wild type (dashed line) activated by pH 5.0. Activation of mutant channels by pH 6.0 significantly decreases the onset time compared with pH 6.5, whereas pH 5.0 does not produce a further decrease. Although pH 6.0 nearly saturates the channel binding sites (same peak current), binding of protons is still the rate-limiting process. In contrast, there is only a small decrease in onset time as the concentration is raised to pH 5.0, suggesting that at this high proton concentration, the onset approximates the value of α in the scheme of Fig. 4A. Because the onset time at pH 5.0 does not differ in wild type and mutant SQL, the mutation does not significantly change the opening rate α. This conclusion holds even if the values obtained for the opening time are underestimated by our perfusion system because such a small value cannot explain the more than one order of magnitude difference in time course of wild type and mutant currents. Together, these observations suggest that the β1-β2 linker most likely modifies a step before channel opening. This is represented in the scheme by the transition C to CH, which describes the sum of several events including the binding of protons and subsequent conformational changes of closed protonated channels. Thus, the substitution M85L in the β1-β2 linker by decreasing the number of channels in the CH state delays channel openings and slows the time course of the macroscopic currents. The same mechanism decreases the number of channels entering the desensitized state, leading to a decrease in the apparent affinity for steady-state desensitization (transition CH to DH in the scheme of Fig. 4A). To ascertain the role of residue 85 in modulating the function of ASIC1 and whether it works also in other species, we examined channels with Met85 in the β1-β2 linker. The previously cloned fish ASIC1 and shark ASIC1b both have Met85 and have been shown to have fast kinetics and high sensitivity to protons (12.Coric T. Zhang P. Todorovic N. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45240-45247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13.Springauf A. Gründer S. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ASIC1 cloned here from EFS also has Met85 and produces fast and small proton-activated currents with an average magnitude of 0.3 ± 0.15 μA/cell. Further analysis of the properties of wild type EFS was not possible owing to the small currents. However, after substitution of the three residues in the β1-β2 linker Ala83-Asn84-Met85 to Ser83-Gln84-Leu85 or M85L alone the currents became ∼100-fold larger, with an average 35 ± 7 μA/cell at pH 6.5 (n = 20) (Fig. 5, A and B). Representative examples of wild type and mutant EFS ASIC1 shown in the same time scale but a 10-fold expanded current scale make evident the fast time course of currents from the wild type channel (Fig. 5C). Calculated time constants of the rise and decay phases of the currents were 3 and 17 ms, whereas time constants for the triple mutant were 26 and 140 ms, respectively. The fast kinetics, above the limits of the two-electrode voltage clamp perfusion system, result in small values for the peak currents of wild type EFS channels. Despite this limitation, the important result is the mark slowing of channel kinetics induced by the mutations. Additional evidence that the small current of wild type EFS results from fast kinetics and not from low expression level is provided by the equal amount of protein found at the cell surface of cells expressing wild type or mutant EFS-SQL channels, whereas the difference in current in the same cells was 100-fold (Fig. 5E). The apparent affinities for protons of EFS-SQL channels were pH50D 7.1 and pH50A 6.7 (Fig. 5D) similar to those of rat. In summary, the results of this work show that inter species differences in the response to protons of ASIC1 stem, at least in part, from variations in amino acid composition of the β1-β2 linker. Subtle substitutions of neutral residues but not of negatively charged residues in the proton-sensor are a strategy used by nature to achieve diversity in pH sensitivity of ASIC1. From an evolutionary point of view, this approach must be more cost effective than changing the structure of the proton-sensor. Differences in proton affinities of ASIC1 may represent an adaptation to maintain similar levels of ASIC1 response to a given change in pH across vertebrates thereby compensate for the high baseline plasma pH of amphibian and aquatic species. We determined that delay of channel openings upon proton stimulation is the mechanism whereby the apparent proton affinity is reduced. A decrease in affinity of any of the proton binding sites could slow the opening rate not because the β1-β2 linker directly binds protons but because the M85L substitution could perturb the structure of the proton sensor indirectly decreasing the affinity of the proton bind site(s). Alternatively, the β1-β2 linker stabilizes a closed conformation through the interaction of residue 85 with other yet to be identified amino acids. Among the residues tested in position 85, leucine was the only one that delayed the progression of C to CH, whereas other amino acids increased the rate of the transition (Table 1), suggesting that Leu85 forms the strongest contact. The crystal structure of chicken ASIC1 (4.Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 14.Gonzales E.B. Kawate T. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 460: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), which is most likely in the desensitized state, shows Leu85 exposed to water, but the side chain points toward the interior of the protein consistent with our proposal of interacting with other residue. Taken together, the results from this work strengthen the functional importance of the segment following transmembrane domain 1 (β1 strand and β1-β2 linker) in channel gating and provide the first evidence that it participates in channel opening.

https://openalex.org/W1986491472,"SNF5, a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is expressed as two isoforms, SNF5a and SNF5b. SNF5 is a tumor suppressor, as mutation of SNF5 leads to tumor formation and cooperates with p53 deficiency to enhance cancer susceptibility. Interestingly, lack of SNF5 inhibits cell survival and embryonic development, potentially through abnormal activation of p53. To further examine this, we generated cell lines in which SNF5a, SNF5b or both can be inducibly knocked down. We found that SNF5 knockdown leads to cell-cycle arrest in G(1), and SNF5a and SNF5b are functionally redundant. We also showed that SNF5 knockdown impairs p53-dependent transcription of p21 and murine double minute 2. However, contrary to earlier reports that p53 is activated by SNF5 knockout in murine cells, SNF5 knockdown leads to decreased, but not increased, expression of both basal and stress-induced p53 in multiple human cell lines. In addition, we showed that SNF5 knockdown induces adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation and inhibits eIF4E expression. Finally, we showed that SNF5 knockdown inhibits p53 translation by eIF4E and replacement of eIF4E in SNF5 knockdown cells restores p53 expression and cell survival. Together, our study results suggest that the p53 pathway is regulated by, and mediates the activity of, SNF5 in tumor suppression and prosurvival."

Correct cellular targeting of BK channels is an important regulatory mechanism, and changes in cell surface expression of these channels have been associated with different physiological demands, for example during pregnancy (8.Song M. Zhu N. Olcese R. Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with aging in coronary arteries (9.Marijic J. Li Q. Song M. Nishimaru K.

Sausbier U. Ruth P. Praetorius H.A. Leipziger J. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 4251-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).BK channels assemble as tetramers of pore-forming α-subunits, encoded by a single gene that undergoes extensive pre-mRNA splicing and can form complexes with a family of regulatory β-subunits (11.Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that alternative splicing at the N or C termini of BK channel α-subunits is a major determinant of BK channel cell surface expression. For example, inclusion of the alternatively spliced SV1 insert at the intracellular N terminus results in expression of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif, CVLF, that prevents efficient export of the channel from the ER (12.Zarei M.M. Eghbali M. Alioua A. Song M. Knaus H.G. Stefani E. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10072-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal mk44 variant (13.Korovkina V.P. Brainard A.M. England S.K. J. Physiol. 2006; 573: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) is endoproteolytically cleaved, resulting in plasma membrane localization of the N terminus of the mk44 variant and intracellular retention of the remaining cleaved pore-forming C terminus. Alternative splicing of the very C terminus of α-subunits is also a major determinant of cell surface expression, although the regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood (14.Ma D. Nakata T. Zhang G. Hoshi T. Li M. Shikano S. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing that results in premature truncation of the BK channel α-subunit C terminus also results in intracellular retention of the channel as exemplified by the murine Δe23 (15.Chen L.

First, a rat splice variant SVcyt that has an ∼80-amino acid in-frame deletion of the linker region is poorly expressed at the cell surface (17.Davies K.P. Zhao W. Tar M. Figueroa J.C. Desai P. Verselis V.K. Kronengold J. Wang H.Z. Melman A. Christ G.J. Eur. Urol. 2007; 52: 1229-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Second, deletion of >30 amino acids in the linker regions produces nonfunctional channels that lack significant cell surface expression (18.Lee J.H. Kim H.J. Kim H.D. Lee B.C. Chun J.S. Park C.S. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 730-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) responsible for the trafficking defect in these linker deletion mutants are not known.In this report, we identify multiple trafficking motifs within the intracellular RCK1-RCK2 linker that control cell surface expression of BK channel α-subunits expressed in mammalian cells. Importantly, we reveal an acidic cluster-like motif (DDXXDXXXI) that is critical for cell surface expression of the channel that can be transplanted to a heterologous nonchannel protein to enhance membrane expression. Furthermore, we have isolated a widely expressed human BK channel splice variant (hSloΔ579–664), in which the exons encoding these trafficking motifs are excluded. Exclusion of these exons results in an in-frame 86-amino acid deletion that encodes a channel that is a dominant negative of cell surface expression. Taken together, our data reveal that alternative splicing of the RCK1-RCK2 linker region, resulting in inclusion/exclusion of multiple trafficking motifs, is an important determinant of BK channel cell surface expression.DISCUSSIONWe have identified three distinct motifs within the intracellular RCK1-RCK2 linker of BK channels that control their cell surface expression. In particular, an acidic cluster-like motif, DDXXDXXXI, is critical for cell surface expression and is highly conserved from flies to man. This acidic motif can be transplanted to nonchannel proteins to accelerate ER export but cannot override pre-existing ER retention signals, as described for other acidic motifs (22.Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Importantly, alternative splicing of a human BK channel splice variant hSloΔ579–664 that excludes the exons encoding this motif results in a trafficking-deficient BK channel that acts as a dominant negative for cell surface expression.The DDXXDXXXI motif may comprise both an acidic cluster motif as well as a degenerate DXXLL motif. Indeed in worms and flies, a DXXLI motif is retained, whereas the third position is an arginine in vertebrates. Thus, although the motif does not share sequence conservation with other trafficking motifs, it is intriguing that the DXXXI motif is predicted to form a short α-helix at the very beginning of the predicted linker region that otherwise lacks a regular secondary structure (18.Lee J.H. Kim H.J. Kim H.D. Lee B.C. Chun J.S. Park C.S. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 730-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A short α-helical structure is a feature commonly associated with ER export signals that do not show sequence homology (16.Kwon S.H. Guggino W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15237-15242Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35.Sevier C.S. Weisz O.A. Davis M. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) as suggested for the more C-terminal ER export sequence in BK channels (16.Kwon S.H. Guggino W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15237-15242Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Acidic cluster motifs are also commonly used as ER export signals, including in other potassium channels (22.Ma D.

Traffic. 2007; 8: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These features also appear crucial for cell surface expression of BK channels. In contrast, the EDE acidic cluster in exon 23 is not essential for surface expression, but mutagenesis does significantly reduce it. Similar acidic clusters have been reported in other transmembrane proteins including inwardly rectifying and TASK3 potassium channels (22.Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 31.Ma D. Zerangue N. Raab-Graham K. Fried S.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Traffic. 2007; 8: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The EXXXLI motif is most likely a member of the (D/E)XXXL(L/I) sorting motif that shows considerable degeneracy; in fact, in AQP4 channels an EXXXLI motif is essential for correct trafficking (30.Madrid R. Le Maout S. Barrault M.B. Janvier K. Benichou S. Mérot J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7008-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).The demonstration here of exclusion of the ER export DDXXDXXXI acidic motif by alternative splicing in the intracellular C-terminal linker of BK channels nicely contrasts with the inclusion of an hydrophobic (CVLF) ER retention signal through alternative splicing of the N-terminal intracellular S0-S1 loop of BK channels (12.Zarei M.M. Eghbali M. Alioua A. Song M. Knaus H.G. Stefani E. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10072-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that alternative splicing plays a major role in controlling cell surface expression of ion channels and that this can be achieved in the same channel by diametrically opposite mechanisms: through either exclusion or inclusion of cognate trafficking motifs.Why do BK channels have multiple trafficking motifs whose inclusion can be controlled by alternative splicing? Because BK channels have pleitropic functions in virtually all tissues of the body, it is likely that multiple trafficking and sorting signals are required to allow the correct surface expression and subcellular localization of BK channels relevant to the target tissue of interest. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that cell surface expression of BK channels is dynamically regulated, both through signals that may regulate splicing and through post-translational modifications and assembly with distinct regulatory β-subunits. Thus these multiple mechanisms are likely coordinated to expose or mask the correct complement of trafficking and sorting signals to allow appropriate distribution of BK channels within distinct cell types. Indeed, alternative splicing of the rat SVcyt ortholog of hSloΔ579–664 is dynamically regulated in corporeal tissue in models of diabetes (17.Davies K.P. Zhao W. Tar M. Figueroa J.C. Desai P.

Whether the dominant negative function of hSloΔ579–664 is physiologically relevant in this or other model systems remains to be explored. Clearly the inclusion (13.Korovkina V.P. Brainard A.M.

Correct cellular targeting of BK channels is an important regulatory mechanism, and changes in cell surface expression of these channels have been associated with different physiological demands, for example during pregnancy (8.Song M. Zhu N. Olcese R. Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with aging in coronary arteries (9.Marijic J. Li Q. Song M. Nishimaru K.

Sausbier U. Ruth P. Praetorius H.A. Leipziger J. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 4251-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).BK channels assemble as tetramers of pore-forming α-subunits, encoded by a single gene that undergoes extensive pre-mRNA splicing and can form complexes with a family of regulatory β-subunits (11.Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that alternative splicing at the N or C termini of BK channel α-subunits is a major determinant of BK channel cell surface expression. For example, inclusion of the alternatively spliced SV1 insert at the intracellular N terminus results in expression of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif, CVLF, that prevents efficient export of the channel from the ER (12.Zarei M.M. Eghbali M. Alioua A. Song M. Knaus H.G. Stefani E. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10072-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal mk44 variant (13.Korovkina V.P. Brainard A.M. England S.K. J. Physiol. 2006; 573: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) is endoproteolytically cleaved, resulting in plasma membrane localization of the N terminus of the mk44 variant and intracellular retention of the remaining cleaved pore-forming C terminus. Alternative splicing of the very C terminus of α-subunits is also a major determinant of cell surface expression, although the regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood (14.Ma D. Nakata T. Zhang G. Hoshi T. Li M. Shikano S. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing that results in premature truncation of the BK channel α-subunit C terminus also results in intracellular retention of the channel as exemplified by the murine Δe23 (15.Chen L.

First, a rat splice variant SVcyt that has an ∼80-amino acid in-frame deletion of the linker region is poorly expressed at the cell surface (17.Davies K.P. Zhao W. Tar M. Figueroa J.C. Desai P.

Second, deletion of >30 amino acids in the linker regions produces nonfunctional channels that lack significant cell surface expression (18.Lee J.H. Kim H.J. Kim H.D. Lee B.C. Chun J.S. Park C.S. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 730-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) responsible for the trafficking defect in these linker deletion mutants are not known.In this report, we identify multiple trafficking motifs within the intracellular RCK1-RCK2 linker that control cell surface expression of BK channel α-subunits expressed in mammalian cells. Importantly, we reveal an acidic cluster-like motif (DDXXDXXXI) that is critical for cell surface expression of the channel that can be transplanted to a heterologous nonchannel protein to enhance membrane expression. Furthermore, we have isolated a widely expressed human BK channel splice variant (hSloΔ579–664), in which the exons encoding these trafficking motifs are excluded. Exclusion of these exons results in an in-frame 86-amino acid deletion that encodes a channel that is a dominant negative of cell surface expression.

Taken together, our data reveal that alternative splicing of the RCK1-RCK2 linker region, resulting in inclusion/exclusion of multiple trafficking motifs, is an important determinant of BK channel cell surface expression. DISCUSSIONWe have identified three distinct motifs within the intracellular RCK1-RCK2 linker of BK channels that control their cell surface expression. In particular, an acidic cluster-like motif, DDXXDXXXI, is critical for cell surface expression and is highly conserved from flies to man. This acidic motif can be transplanted to nonchannel proteins to accelerate ER export but cannot override pre-existing ER retention signals, as described for other acidic motifs (22.Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Importantly, alternative splicing of a human BK channel splice variant hSloΔ579–664 that excludes the exons encoding this motif results in a trafficking-deficient BK channel that acts as a dominant negative for cell surface expression.The DDXXDXXXI motif may comprise both an acidic cluster motif as well as a degenerate DXXLL motif. Indeed in worms and flies, a DXXLI motif is retained, whereas the third position is an arginine in vertebrates. Thus, although the motif does not share sequence conservation with other trafficking motifs, it is intriguing that the DXXXI motif is predicted to form a short α-helix at the very beginning of the predicted linker region that otherwise lacks a regular secondary structure (18.Lee J.H. Kim H.J. Kim H.D. Lee B.C. Chun J.S. Park C.S. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 730-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A short α-helical structure is a feature commonly associated with ER export signals that do not show sequence homology (16.Kwon S.H. Guggino W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that alternative splicing plays a major role in controlling cell surface expression of ion channels and that this can be achieved in the same channel by diametrically opposite mechanisms: through either exclusion or inclusion of cognate trafficking motifs.Why do BK channels have multiple trafficking motifs whose inclusion can be controlled by alternative splicing? Because BK channels have pleitropic functions in virtually all tissues of the body, it is likely that multiple trafficking and sorting signals are required to allow the correct surface expression and subcellular localization of BK channels relevant to the target tissue of interest. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that cell surface expression of BK channels is dynamically regulated, both through signals that may regulate splicing and through post-translational modifications and assembly with distinct regulatory β-subunits. Thus these multiple mechanisms are likely coordinated to expose or mask the correct complement of trafficking and sorting signals to allow appropriate distribution of BK channels within distinct cell types. Indeed, alternative splicing of the rat SVcyt ortholog of hSloΔ579–664 is dynamically regulated in corporeal tissue in models of diabetes (17.Davies K.P. Zhao W. Tar M. Figueroa J.C. Desai P.

Whether the dominant negative function of hSloΔ579–664 is physiologically relevant in this or other model systems remains to be explored. Clearly the inclusion (13.Korovkina V.P. Brainard A.M.

We have identified three distinct motifs within the intracellular RCK1-RCK2 linker of BK channels that control their cell surface expression. In particular, an acidic cluster-like motif, DDXXDXXXI, is critical for cell surface expression and is highly conserved from flies to man. This acidic motif can be transplanted to nonchannel proteins to accelerate ER export but cannot override pre-existing ER retention signals, as described for other acidic motifs (22.Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Importantly, alternative splicing of a human BK channel splice variant hSloΔ579–664 that excludes the exons encoding this motif results in a trafficking-deficient BK channel that acts as a dominant negative for cell surface expression. The DDXXDXXXI motif may comprise both an acidic cluster motif as well as a degenerate DXXLL motif. Indeed in worms and flies, a DXXLI motif is retained, whereas the third position is an arginine in vertebrates. Thus, although the motif does not share sequence conservation with other trafficking motifs, it is intriguing that the DXXXI motif is predicted to form a short α-helix at the very beginning of the predicted linker region that otherwise lacks a regular secondary structure (18.Lee J.H. Kim H.J. Kim H.D. Lee B.C. Chun J.S. Park C.S. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 730-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A short α-helical structure is a feature commonly associated with ER export signals that do not show sequence homology (16.Kwon S.H. Guggino W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15237-15242Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Acidic cluster motifs are also commonly used as ER export signals, including in other potassium channels (22.Ma D.

https://openalex.org/W2093316237,"EGFRvIII, a frequent genetic alteration of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been shown to increase the migratory potential of tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. Previously, we showed that signal regulatory protein α1 (SIRPα1) receptors interact with SHP-2 to inhibit wild-type (wt) EGFR-mediated tumor migration, survival and cell transformation. However, the effects of SIRPα1 inhibitory receptors on EGFRvIII-mediated phenotypes are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SIRPα1 receptor on the EGFRvIII signalosome and phenotypes. Overexpression of SIRPα1 in U87MG.EGFRvIII cells inhibited transformation and migration in a MAPK-dependent manner, and is independent of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway. We observed reduced EGFRvIII/SHP-2/Gab1/Grb2/Sos-1 interaction and enhanced SIRP/SHP-2 association in U87MG.EGFRvIII/SIRPα1 cells when compared with empty vector control cells. Interestingly, SIRPα1 overexpression differentially modulated SHP-2 phosphorylation at tyrosyl 542 and 580 residues, which may regulate Erk1/2 activity and the EGFRvIII phenotype. In addition, SIRPα1-expressing cells exhibited reduced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and its recruitment to the EGFRvIII/Grb2/Sos-1/Gab1/SHP-2 complex. Collectively, our data indicate that SIRPα1 specifically affects the SHP-2/FAK/Grb2/Sos-1/MAPK activation loop to downmodulate EGFRvIII-mediated migration and transformation. Further understanding of the molecular interactions between the SIRPα1 inhibitory receptor and the EGFRvIII signalosome may facilitate the identification of novel targets to inhibit the EGFRvIII glioblastoma phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2041901511,"Background Ischemia is a pathophysiological condition due to blockade in blood supply to a specific tissue thus damaging the physiological activity of the tissue. Different in vivo models are presently available to study ischemia in heart and other tissues. However, no ex vivo ischemia model has been available to date for routine ischemia research and for faster screening of anti-ischemia drugs. In the present study, we took the opportunity to develop an ex vivo model of partial ischemia using the vascular bed of 4th day incubated chick embryo. Methodology/Principal Findings Ischemia was created in chick embryo by ligating the right vitelline artery using sterile surgical suture. Hypoxia inducible factor- 1 alpha (HIF-1α), creatine phospho kinase-MB and reactive oxygen species in animal tissues and cells were measured to confirm ischemia in chick embryo. Additionally, ranolazine, N-acetyl cysteine and trimetazidine were administered as an anti-ischemic drug to validate the present model. Results from the present study depicted that blocking blood flow elevates HIF-1α, lipid peroxidation, peroxynitrite level in ischemic vessels while ranolazine administration partially attenuates ischemia driven HIF-1α expression. Endothelial cell incubated on ischemic blood vessels elucidated a higher level of HIF-1α expression with time while ranolazine treatment reduced HIF-1α in ischemic cells. Incubation of caprine heart strip on chick embryo ischemia model depicted an elevated creatine phospho kinase-MB activity under ischemic condition while histology of the treated heart sections evoked edema and disruption of myofibril structures. Conclusions/Significance The present study concluded that chick embryo partial ischemia model can be used as a novel ex vivo model of ischemia. Therefore, the present model can be used parallel with the known in vivo ischemia models in understanding the mechanistic insight of ischemia development and in evaluating the activity of anti-ischemic drug."
https://openalex.org/W2063672127,"Background Binding of proteins in ion exchange chromatography is dominated by electrostatic interactions and can be tuned by adjusting pH and ionic strength of the solvent. Therefore, the isoelectric region (IER), the pH region of almost zero charge near the pI, has been used to predict the binding properties of proteins. Principal findings Usually the IER is small and binding and elution is carried out at pH values near to the pI. However, some proteins with an extended IER have been shown to bind and elute far away from its pI. To analyze factors that mediate the size of the IER and to identify proteins with an extended IER, two protein families consisting of more than 7000 proteins were systematically investigated. Most proteins were found to have a small IER and thus are expected to bind or elute near to their pI, while only a small fraction of less than 2% had a large IER. Conclusions Only four factors, the number of histidines, the pI, the number of titratable amino acids and the ratio of acidic to basic residues, are sufficient to reliably classify proteins by their IER based on their sequence only, and thus to predict their binding and elution behaviour in ion exchange chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W2113602382,"T cell activation and immune synapse formation require the appropriate activation and clustering of the integrin, LFA-1. Previous work has reported that the calpain family of calcium-dependent proteases are important regulators of integrin activation and modulate T cell adhesion and migration. However, these studies have been limited by the use of calpain inhibitors, which have known off-target effects.Here, we used a LoxP/CRE system to specifically deplete calpain 4, a small regulatory calpain subunit required for expression and activity of ubiquitously expressed calpains 1 and 2, in CD4+ T cells. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells developed normally in Capn4(F/F):CD4-CRE mice and had severely diminished expression of Calpain 1 and 2, diminished talin proteolysis and impaired casein degradation. Calpain 4-deficient T cells showed no difference in adhesion or migration on the LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1 compared to control T cells. Moreover, there was no impairment in conjugation between Capn4(F/F):CD4-CRE T cells and antigen presenting cells, and the conjugates were still capable of polarizing LFA-1, PKC-theta and actin to the immune synapse. Furthermore, T cells from Capn4(F/F):CD4-CRE mice showed normal proliferation in response to either anti-CD3/CD28 coated beads or cognate antigen-loaded splenocytes. Finally, there were no differences in the rates of apoptosis following extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic stimuli.Our findings demonstrate that calpain 4 is not necessary for LFA-1-mediated adhesion, conjugation or migration. These results challenge previous reports that implicate a central role for calpains in the regulation of T cell LFA-1 function."
https://openalex.org/W2058551052,"Background Although scientific innovation has been a long-standing topic of interest for historians, philosophers and cognitive scientists, few studies in biomedical research have examined from researchers' perspectives how high impact publications are developed and why they are consistently produced by a small group of researchers. Our objective was therefore to interview a group of researchers with a track record of high impact publications to explore what mechanism they believe contribute to the generation of high impact publications. Methodology/Principal Findings Researchers were located in universities all over the globe and interviews were conducted by phone. All interviews were transcribed using standard qualitative methods. A Grounded Theory approach was used to code each transcript, later aggregating concept and categories into overarching explanation model. The model was then translated into a System Dynamics mathematical model to represent its structure and behavior. Five emerging themes were found in our study. First, researchers used heuristics or rules of thumb that came naturally to them. Second, these heuristics were reinforced by positive feedback from their peers and mentors. Third, good communication skills allowed researchers to provide feedback to their peers, thus closing a positive feedback loop. Fourth, researchers exhibited a number of psychological attributes such as curiosity or open-mindedness that constantly motivated them, even when faced with discouraging situations. Fifth, the system is dominated by randomness and serendipity and is far from a linear and predictable environment. Some researchers, however, took advantage of this randomness by incorporating mechanisms that would allow them to benefit from random findings. The aggregation of these themes into a policy model represented the overall expected behavior of publications and their impact achieved by high impact researchers. Conclusions The proposed selection mechanism provides insights that can be translated into research coaching programs as well as research policy models to optimize the introduction of high impact research at a broad scale among institutional and governmental agencies."
