https://openalex.org/W1963500339,"Allelic changes at three loci largely explain Chrysopa downesi's sympatric speciation from a Chrysopa carnea-like ancestor. Disruptive selection first produced a stable polymorphism based on a single pair of alleles that adapted individuals to two habitats, and second, it established seasonal asynchrony in reproduction through allelic substitutions at two loci."

The measurements were made in the 9.5-micrometer wavelength region, where a strong ozone infrared absorption band exists. The radiometer measured solar absorption at selected wavelengths, with a spectral resolution of 0.001 reciprocal centimeter, equivalent to the half-width of an ozone absorption line at the 10-millibar altitude level. A carbon dioxide laser served as the local oscillator. This technique can be used to gather important data on both tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, which are not readily accessible with other remote-sensing techniques."

The precise positioning and relative width of these varices destabilize the animal as it falls through the water, substantially increasing the chances that it will land upright (aperture down). For a gastropod pulled off rocks and dropped by predatory fish, such a mechanism could considerably reduce its probability of being eaten."

The height of the warm period coincides with the Jomon marine transgression, which flooded coastal lands and invaded river valleys. The Jomon culture of the post-Pleistocene shows changes in subsistence patterns and site location at different time periods. Although it is very long and there is definite cultural continuity, shifts in settlement patterns and the development of fishing and collecting techniques show that it was not static. Village layouts and intersite relationships are examined. While there is not yet enough information for the reconstruction of the environment of the Korean peninsula, investigations seem to show shifts in settlement location from low coastal areas to hills and slopes occurring at relatively the same time periods as in Japan. House plans and average size of dwellings in Korea are briefly discussed."

The strong popular antipathy aroused in some regions seems to have led ERDA to pin much of its hopes on the still-sympathetic attitude found in three western states: Washington, New Mexico, and Nevada."

https://openalex.org/W2077706934,"Half a dozen astronomy graduate students facing meager job prospects decide they would rather fight than switch. They drop out of the postdoctoral rat race, move to California, and establish a close-knit if impoverished community centered around astronomy. They build their own observatory complete with a telescope superior to those of many universities and incorporating the latest in modern electronic instruments, all the while maintaining their independence and doing without government grants. They undertake an ambitious research effort and win the respect, admiration, and even envy of prominent astronomers."

Through faulty proofreading at Science, an omitted line was not detected and the table as printed is meaningless. The body of Table 1 should read."
