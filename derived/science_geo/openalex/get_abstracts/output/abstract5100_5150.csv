https://openalex.org/W2014663128,"Antibodies to substance P with a high titer have been produced and used in immunohistochemical studies on the peripheral and central nervous system of the rat and the cat. Evidence was obtained for the localization of substance P in a certain population of primary sensory neurons, probably small nerve cells with unmyelinated processes. Substance P or a peptide similar to it was also observed in cell bodies in the medial habenula and in probable nerve terminals in many brain areas. The results give morphological support for a transmitter (or modulator) role of substance P in the nervous system."

The affected animals had gonadal changes which included intra-abdominal or fibrotic testes, or both. Additionally, nodular masses in the ampullary region of the reproductive tract were observed in 6 of 24 animals; one of these appeared to be preneoplastic."
https://openalex.org/W1591116477,"A procedure for the purification of rabbit liver phosphorylase phosphatase is described. The specific activity of the preparation is 2,100 units/mg of protein, representing a 25,000-fold purification. During the initial steps of the purification a large activation of enzyme activity was observed. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated by Sephadex G-75 chromatography to be 35,000, and by sucrose density ultracentrifugation to be 34,000 (2.9 S). On Na dodecyl-SO4 polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis a single component with a molecular weight of 34,000 was observed. The pH optimum is 6.9 to 7.4, and the Km for rabbit muscle phosphorylase alpha is 2 muM. The same procedure is also applicable to the extensive purification of phosphorylase phosphatase from rabbit muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1562255636,"Kidney beans, Phaseolus vulgaris, contain a proteinaceous inhibitor of alpha-amylase, which we have named phaseolamin. The inhibitor has been purified to homogeneity by conventional protein fractionation methods involving heat treatment, dialysis, and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex G-100, and CM-cellulose. Phaseolamin is specific for animal alpha-amylases, having no activity towards the corresponding plant, bacterial, and fungal enzymes, or any other hydrolytic enzyme tested. Optimal inhibitory activity is expressed during preincubation of enzyme and inhibitor at pH 5.5 and 37 degrees. Substrate prevents inhibition. Measurement of the stoichiometry on inhibition showed that a 1:1 complex of alpha-amylase and inhibitor is formed. Complex formation was demonstrated by chromatography on Sephadex G-100. The phaseolamin-amylase complex is dissociated at low pH values, apparently as a result of destruction of the enzyme; the complex cannot be dissociated by other conditions unfavorable for inhibition (low temperature or high pH). Phaseolamin inhibits hog pancreatic alpha-amylase in a noncompetitive manner."
https://openalex.org/W1487299102,"Sodium azide, hydroxylamine, and phenylhydrazine at concentrations of 1 mM increased the activity of soluble guanylate cyclase from rat liver 2- to 20-fold. The increased accumulation of guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate in reaction mixtures with sodium azide was not due to altered levels of substrate, GTP, or altered hydrolysis of guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. The activation of guanylate cyclase was dependent upon NaN3 concentration and temperature; preincubation prevented the time lag of activation observed during incubation. The concentration of NaN3 that resulted in half-maximal activation was 0.04 mM. Sodium azide increased the apparent Km for GTP from 35 to 113 muM. With NaN3 activation the enzyme was less dependent upon the concentration of free Mn2+. Activation of enzyme by NaN3 was irreversible with dilution or dialysis of reaction mixtures. The slopes of Arrhenius plots were altered with sodium azide-activated enzyme, while gel filtration of the enzyme on Sepharose 4B was unaltered by NaN3 treatment. Triton X-100 increased the activity of the enzyme, and in the presence of Triton X-100 the activation by NaN3 was not observed. Trypsin treatment decreased both basal guanylate cyclase activity and the responsiveness to NaN3. Phospholipase A, phospholipase C, and neuraminidase increased basal activity but had little effect on the responsiveness to NaN3. Both soluble and particulate guanylate cyclase from liver and kidney were stimulated with NaN3. The particulate enzyme from cerebral cortex and cerebellum was also activated with NaN3, whereas the soluble enzyme from these tissues was not. Little or no effect of NaN3 was observed with preparations from lung, heart, and several other tissues. The lack of an effect with NaN3 on soluble GUANYLATE Cyclase from heart was probably due to the presence of an inhibitor of NaN3 activation in heart preparations. The effect of NaN3 was decreased or absent when soluble guanylate cyclase from liver was purified or stored at -20degrees. The activation of guanylate cyclase by NaN3 is complex and may be the result of the nucleophilic agent acting on the enzyme directly or what may be more likely on some other factor in liver preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1582006209,"Incubation of abbreviated tRNA's (tRNA-C-COH's) with (chemically) preaminoacylated P1, P2-di(adenosine 5'-)diphosphates in the presence of purified RNA ligase effected transfer of an aminoacyladenylate moiety to the 3'-terminus of the abbreviated tRNA's in good yield. Aminoacylated (or misacylated) tRNA's may thus be prepared from fractionated or unfractionated tRNA-C-COH's; each of the five dinucleoside diphosphates tested was utilized as a substrate by RNA ligase. That the resulting aminoacylated tRNA's were identical with those prepared by enzymatic aminoacylation was judged by comparison of 1) chromatographic properties on benzolated diethylaminoethyl-cellulose, 2) rates of chemical deacylation, and 3) affinities for elongation factor Tu, as well as 4) the ability of misacylated tRNA's so derived to be deacylated chemically and then reactivated enzymatically with their cognate amino acids."

The purified enzyme preparation had a single major band with a molecular weight of 53,000 to 54,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Other studies indicated that in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, purified epoxide hydrase exists as high molecular weight aggregates. The preparation was essentially free of heme and flavin, but still contained small amounts of lipids and Emulgen 911."
https://openalex.org/W1560761357,"1. A stable ATPase complex with sensitivity to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (TFo-F1) was purified from the membranes of the thermophilic aerobic bacterium PS3, by ion exchange chromatography in the presence of Triton X-100. 2. The ATPase of TFo-F1 was maximal at 70 degrees at pH 8.6 and was stable after monomerization in 4 M urea and 0.5% Triton X-100 at 25 degrees. The activity was dependent on Mg2+, Co2+, or Mn2+, and it became insensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide when Ca2+ or Cd2+ was added instead. 3. TFo-F1 required P-lipids of this bacterium contained branched fatty acyl groups but no unsaturated groups and were stable against oxidation and heat. 4. Studies by electron microscopy, gel electrophoresis, and use of anti-ATPase antibody and [3H]acetyl-ATPase indicated that the TFo-F1 complex was composed of an ATPase moiety (TF1, five different subunits) and a hydrophobic moiety (TFo, three different subunits. TFo conferred TF1 with sensitivity to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. 5. Vesicles catalyzing 32Pi-ATP exchange and ATP-driven enhancement of fluorescence of anilinonaphthalene sulfonate were reconstituted by dialyzing pure TFo-F1 and P-lipids together, and were active even at 50-75 degrees. The vesicles reconstituted from TFo-F1 and bacterial P-lipids were more stable than those reconstituted from TFo-F1 and soybean P-lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1589171097,"Purified nuclei of HeLa S3 cells contain two DNA-dependent DNA polymerases that have distinct physical and enzymatic properties. We have investigated the variations in their activity during the cell cycle of a synchronized culture. Cells were synchronized by a double thymidine block, harvested at various phases of the cycle, and the two DNA polymerases were purified partially by DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose chromatography. The activity of DNA polymerase I (low molecular weight, N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive) remains essentially constant throughout the cycle. The activity of DNA polymerase II (high molecular weight, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive), however, increases during G1 to mid-S and declines, 7- to 10-fold between late-S and G2. Addition of cycloheximide (60 mug/ml) to cultures 12 hours after the release from thymidine block abolishes the rise in the activity of DNA polymerase II. Cycloheximide also reduced the activity of DNA polymerase I by 60%. Addition of hydroxyurea (1mM) at 1 hour after release has no effect on the activity of either enzyme. We conclude that in HeLa cells, DNA polymerase I and II are distinct enzymes, that DNA polymerase II probably functions in DNA replication and is probably induced in response to stimuli for DNA biosynthesis."

Although it has been reported to occur in both edible and nonfood proteins only after alkali treatment, it has now been identified in food proteins that had not been subjected to alkali. Lysinoalanine is generated in a variety of proteins when heated under nonalkaline conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1591591358,"Acute glucagon treatment of intact rats has been found to cause a stimulation of hepatic mitochondrial respiration as measured by monitoring oxygen uptake polarographically. Rates of State 3 respiration with several NAD-linked substrates and succinate were increased significantly after hormonal treatment and isolation of mitochondria. This stimulation cannot be ascribed to a partial uncoupling effect since State 4 respiration as measured by monitoring oxygen uptake polarographically. Rates of State 3 respiration with either slightly increased or unchanged. Furthermore, rates of uncoupled respiration with these substrates were also stimulated after hormonal treatment. On the other hand, respiratory rates (State 3, 4, and uncoupled) with ascorbate-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine as substrate were unaffected by glucagon treatment. The hormonally stimulated rates of respiration produced a corresponding increase in the rate of generation of high energy state as indicated in measurements of Ca2+ uptake by isolated mitochondria. Rates of Ca2+ uptake were monitored by two methods: measurement of initial rates of proton ejection following CaCl2 additions and measurement of disappearance of Ca2+ from the suspension medium using murexide as indicator in a dual wavelength spectrophotometer. A significant stimulation in the initial rate of succinate-dependent Ca2+ uptake was noted after glucagon treatment of animals and isolation of hepatic mitochondria. No effect of the hormonal treatment was seen on the extent of Ca2+ uptake or the stoichiometry of H+ ejected per Ca2+ taken up. That the hormonal effect on Ca2+ transport is at the level of the substrate-induced generation of high energy state is indicated by the observation that no effect of glucagon treatment is seen on ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake. Glucagon-induced changes in the activities of substrate-metabolizing enzymes are considered unlikely for the following reasons: (a) previously published data showed a lack of a hormonal effect on pyruvate-metabolizing enzymes and (b) data in this study showing no effect of glucagon treatment on the activity of NAD-malate dehydrogenase as measured in mitochondrial lysates. All of these observations are consistent with either an activation of mitochondrial substrate transport and/or a stimulation of mitochondrial electron transport by glucagon treatment. Regardless of the exact mechanism involved, the effect of the hormonal treatment is to produce an increase in ATP synthetic and ion-pumping capability during a period of increased energy demand, i.e. increased gluconeogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2086944433,"We have analyzed the transcription of a cloned silkworm tRNA2Ala gene in germinal vesicle extracts of X. laevis oocytes. The primary transcript was sequenced; it is 98 nucleotides long, beginning with a 5â² triphosphate nucleotide and ending in a 3â² oligouridine stretch. After transcription for long periods of time, enzymes in the frog extract also process the tRNA2Ala precursor to remove extra 5â² and 3â² nucleotides and to add a CCA end. The twenty-two extra nucleotides at the 3â² end of this precursor are recovered as an intact fragment, implicating a new site of endoribonuclease cleavage in eucaryotic tRNA processing. This enzyme activity has also been demonstrated by reincubation of isolated pre-tRNA2Ala with a germinal vesicle extract. The products of in vitro cleavage are the same as those seen in the transcription reactions. The tRNA2Ala precursor molecules are made faithfully in the system with as few as 6 bp of Bombyx mori DNA upstream of the transcription initiation site of the tRNA2Ala gene. This result narrows down the minimal amount of DNA adjacent to the 5â² end of a eucaryotic tRNA gene needed to support proper initiation by RNA polymerase III."

Conversely, acetylcholine increases cyclic GMP but not cycle AMP in the ganglion; this increase also occurs within postganglionic neurons. Thus, different neurotransmitters can selectively alter cyclic nucleotide levels within the same neuronal population."

https://openalex.org/W1559947786,"A 5'-nucleotidase with unique specificity has been identified in the soluble fraction of normal human erythrocytes. It mediates the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of pyrimidine 5'-ribosemonophosphates but is catalytically ineffective with purine nucleotides or with the 2'-, 3'-, or cyclic isomers of pyrimidine nucleotides. Activities at 37 degrees in dialyzed hemolysates of nromal human erythrocytes averaged 7.3 and 6.2 mumol of Pi liberated per hour per g of hemoglobin for the substrates UMP and CMP, respectively. Activity with TMP as substrate was approximately one-half as much as with UMP or CMP. Apparent Michaelis constants were 0.33 mM UMP, 0.15 mM CMP, and 1.0 mM TMP. Magnesium was required for optimal activity, and this cation could not be replaced by Mn2+. Maximum activity was obtained between pH 7.0 and 7.5 with rapid decreases in more alkaline media and moderate decreases with acidification. The enzyme was quite sensitive to heat and was strongly inhibited by AMP, by some purine bases, and by both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. Divalent cations of heavy metals were also strongly inhibitory, as were agents active against sulfhydryl groups. The presence of substrates and/or 2-mercaptoethanol provided considerable protection against some of these deleterious agents and conditions. Pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase activity in hemolysates was clearly distinguishable from erythrocyte acid phosphatase and from leukocyte and serum alkaline phosphatases and nucleotidases."
https://openalex.org/W1592645517,"Hepatic nuclei that are isolated in aquenous solutions of low ionic strength or glycerol contain all or nearly all the nonmitochondrial DNA polymerase activity of the cell. The presence of polymerase activity in the cytoplasm is due to extraction of nuclear enzymes by buffer and inorganic salts. Even with low ionic strength solutions, some leaching of nuclear enzymes occurs if the concentration of liver in the homogenizing medium is greater than 10%. As defined by sucrose gradient analysis, the normal adult rat liver nucleus contains mainly or entirely a single species of DNA polymerase (3.2 S) whereas the regenerating nucleus after 70% hepatectomy has an additional enzyme (7.1 S). The total activity of regenerating nuclei is about twice the normal value. The increase resides in the 7.1 S activity. The 7.1 S DNA polymerase had been purified partially from regenerating liver nuclei (isolated in low ionic strength solutions) and cytosol (prepared under conditions of nuclear enzyme extraction). The properties of the activity from the two sources are indistinguishable. A mixture of albumin and spermidine enhances by several-fold the activities of the 3.2 S and 7.1 S DNA polymerases. In the presence of spermidine, but not in its absence, the activity of the 7.1 S DNA polymerase is strictly proportional to the amount of the enzyme preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1565344536,"Ethanolaminephosphate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.14), which catalyzes a central step in phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis, has been purified 1000-fold from a postmicrosomal supernatant from rat liver. The enzyme, which requires a reducing agent, like dithiothreitol, for activity, is stable for weeks at 0-4 degrees when stored in the presence of dithiothreitol and in the pH range 7.5 to 9.0. A molecular weight of 100 to 120 X 10(3) was estimated by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-200. Gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate gave only one protein band with an apparent molecular weight of 49 to 50 X 10(3). The reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is reversible with a Keq for the forward reaction of 0.46 under the assay conditions. Michaelis constants of 53 and 65 muM were determined for CTP and ethanolaminephosphate, respectively. From the product inhibition pattern an ordered sequential reaction mechanism is proposed, in which CTP is the first substrate to add to the enzyme and CDP-ethanolamine is the last product to be released. The possible role of this reaction in the regulation of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis in liver is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1565312099,"The tissue content of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is controlled principally by the protein binding of this coenzyme and its hydrolysis by a cellular phosphatase. The present study identifies this enzyme and its intracellular location in rat liver. Pyridoxal-P is not hydrolyzed by the acid phosphatase of intact lysosomes. At pH 7.4 and 9.0, the subcellular distribution of pyridoxal-P phosphatase activity is similar to the for p-nitrophenyl-P, and the major portion of both activities is found in the plasma membrane fraction. The ratio of specific activities for pyridoxal-P and p-nitrophenyl-P hydrolysis remains relatively constant during the isolation of plasma membranes. These activities also behave concordantly with respect to pH rate profile, pH-Km profile, and response to chelating agents, Zn2+, Mg2+, and inhibitors. Kinetic studies indicate that pyridoxal-P binds to same enzyme sites as beta-glycerophosphate and phosphorylcholine. The data strongly favor alkaline phosphatase as the enzyme which functions in the control of pyridoxal-P and pyridoxamine-P metabolism in rat liver. Alkaline phosphatase was solubilized from isolated plasma membranes. The kinetic properties of the enzyme are not markedly altered by its dissociation from the membrane matrix. However, there are significant differences in its behavior toward Mg2+ which suggest a structural role for Mg2+ in liver alkaline phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1593885725,"Three lines of evidence are presented indicating that GTP hydrolysis associated with eukaryotic peptide initiation occurs in the absence of 60 S subunits when methionyl-tRNAf is bound to 40 S ribosomal subunits. An enzyme fraction required for binding of methionyl-tRNAf to 40 S subunits and peptide initiation, tentatively equated with eIF-(4 + 5), has GTPase activity and appears to be responsible for hydrolysis of GTP in the methionyl-tRNAf.eIF-2.GTP complex. Direct analysis of the methionyl-tRNAf.40 S complex formed with with eIF-2 and [8-3H] guanine, [gamma-32P]GTP reveals bound guanine but not gamma-phosphate. Edeine, a peptide antibiotic containing spermidine and beta-tyrosine residues at its COOH terminus and NH2 terminus, respectively, blocks peptide initiation and interferes with binding of methionyl-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits. Inhibition of binding is observed when the eIF-2-mediated binding reaction is carried out with GTP but not with guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)triphosphate or guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate. Edeine was labeled by iodination and shown to bind with high affinity to 40 S but not to 60 S ribosomal subunits. It is suggested that edeine blocks a specific site on the 40 S ribosomal subunit to which a segment of the methionyl-tRNAf molecule is bound during the course of the initiation reaction sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1595984863,"Aspartate transcarbamylase from Bacillus subtilis has been purified to apparent homogeneity. A subunit molecular weight of 33,500 +/- 1,000 was obtained from electrophoresis in polyarcylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate and from sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the protein dissolved in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was determined to be 102,000 +/- 2,000 by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analysis. Aspartate transcarbamylase thus appears to be a trimeric protein; cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate and electrophoretic analysis confirmed this structure. B. subtilis aspartate transcarbamylase has an amino acid composition quite similar to that of the catalytic subunit from Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase; only the content of four amino acids is substantially different. The denaturated enzyme has one free sulfhydryl group. Aspartate transcarbamylase exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics and was neither inhibited nor activated by nucleotides. Several anions stimulated activity 2- to 5-fold. Immunochemical studies indicated very little similarity between B. subtilis and E. coli aspartate transcarbamylase or E. coli aspartate transcarbamylase catalytic subunit."

The concentration dependence of the apparent relative molar enthalpy of lysozyme derived from these results gives the thermodynamic parameters for the formation of an intermolecular contact in an indefinite (head-to-tail) self-association process as delta G 0 = -3.9 kcal/mol, delta H 0 = -6.4 kcal/mol, and delta S 0 = -8,3 e.u. Oxindolealanine-62-lysozyme does not undergo self-association reactions that can be detected calorimetrically. This derivative reacts with native lysozyme to form hybrid polymeric species with free energy and enthalpy of interaction similar to those for the polymers of native lysozyme. These results are consistent with the intermolecular contact in the self-assocaition of lysozyme being asymmetric (head-to-tail). The heat of dilution of the derivative of lysozyme in which Glu-35 is blocked as the ester with oxindolealanine-108 is like that observed for native lysozyme in acid solution and is independent of pH. The concentration difference spectrum that develops through self-association is of the shape expected for introduction of an indole chromophore into a charge-free region of the intermolecular contact. The foregoing results indicate that Glu-35 and Trp-62 are part of the contact, that perturbation of Trp-108 does not make a principle contribution to the concentration difference spectrum, and that no acid group other than Glu-35 is perturbed by self-association. There is a small change in the heat of (GlcNAc)3 binding over the range 0.005 to 0.034 M saccharide. These data give the value of -1 kcal/mol for the enthalpy change for formation of the 2:1 saccharide-enzyme complex (ES2) from ES and S."
https://openalex.org/W1480406908,"The peptide chain initiation factor, Co-EIF-1 has been purified to homogeneity. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the homogeneous preparation gives a single protein band corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 20,000. In the crude preparation, Co-EIF-1 exists in two molecular forms: Co-EIF-1H (Mr = 200,000) and Co-EIF-1L (Mr = 20,000). Both forms are equally active in all the reactions studied. Upon heating, the heavy form (Co-EIF-1H) is completely converted into the light form (Co-EIF-1L). Radioactively labeled [14C]Co-EIF-1 was prepared by reductive alkylation using [14C]formaldehyde and borohydride. [14C]Methyl-Co-EIF-1 binds specifically to EIF-1; EIF-1.[14C]Co-EIF-1 complex was analyzed by gel (Sephadex G-100) filtration. EIF-1.Co-EIF-1 complex is distinctly more stable towards heat than EIF-1 alone and the quarternary complex, Met-tRNAf.EIF-1.Co-EIF-1.GTP is more resistant to aurintricarboxylic acid than the ternary complex, Met-tRNAf.EIF-1.GTP. Both the quarternary complex, Met-tRNAf.EIF-1.Co-EIF-1.GTP, and the ternary complex, Met-tRNAf.EIF-1.GTP, are equally sensitive to Mg2+ in the presence of EIF-2 (TDF).

https://openalex.org/W1606955219,"The reoxidation of fully reduced and denatured bovine trypsinogen and the regeneration of the native structure can be accomplished if the protein is initially attached to Agarose beads. Reoxidation was performed under aerobic conditions, in the presence of mercaptoethanol and dehydroascorbate or with a mixture of reduced and oxidized glutathione. In 24 hours, the yields of regenerated trypsinogen were 60 to 70% with 0.2 to 0.6 mg of protein bound/ml of gel but 30% or less if greater than 1.7 mg of protein were bound. Rapid reoxidation, with dehydroascorbate as catalyst, gave molecules which could not be converted to active trypsin. However, if the incorrectly folded structures were placed in a mixture of reduced and oxidized glutathione, the molecules underwent disulfide interchange and could continue to refold. The rapidly reoxidized molecules regained their native structure with the same rate and to the same extent as they did initially in the absence of rapid reoxidation. Therefore, the rate-limiting step in the refolding of trypsinogen was disulfide interchange. The regenerated Agarose-bound trypsinogen displayed the usual properties of the native molecule in (a) its conversion to active trypsin by a process of limited proteolysis, (b) the kinetic constants of the activated product toward typical trypsin substrates, and (c) the limited cleavage of 1 disulfide bond with sodium borohydride. Refoldind of immobilized trypsin was also observed with an overall yield of 50%. Trypsin can fold spontaneously to its native structure even though it lacks the NH2-terminal hexapeptide of its precursor."

The enxymic activity was associated primarily with a cell debris-membranes fraction deribed from the 100 x g pellet. This fraction contained mainly membrane-like particulates and was free of nuclei. Little or no activity was associated with the purified nuclei. The hypothalamic 5 alpha-reductase was stimulated by NADPH but not by NADH. The reaction proceeded optimally over a pH range of 6.0 to 7.2 and at a temperaturhe substrate specificity of the enzyme for other delta 4-3-ketosteroids and the ability of these steroids to inhibit the 5 alpha reduction of [1,2-3H]progesterone as well as the effect of 17 beta-estradiol were also studied. 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one was more reactive that progesterone, while testosterone was the least reactive. The estimated Km for 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one was 8.6 +/- 1.9 x 10(-7) M, and for testosterone, 1.6 +/- 1.4 x 10(-5) M. The inhibition studies indicate that 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one and 17 beta-estradiol are competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors, respectively, of the 5 alpha reduction of progesterone with Ki of 6.0 +/- 3.0 x 10(-8) M for 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one and Kii (intercept inhibition constant) of 2.6 +/- 0.7 x 10(-5) M and Kis (slope inhibition constant) of 3.6 +/- 0.6 x 10(-5) M for 17 beta-estradiol.

The microsomal system was more active than the mitochondrial system. With the microsomal system the rate of reaction was considerably faster with free 3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic acid as substrate than with the corresponding coenzyme A ester. Addition of coenzyme A inhibited the activity. Addition of cofactors other than ATP and coenzyme A did not markedly influence the reaction. The 100,000 times g supernatant fluid could be substituted with a protein fraction obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation and Sephadex chromatography of the 100,000 times g supernatant fluid. The reaction was not catalyzed by a mixed function oxidase since there was no incorporation of 18O into the product when the reaction was performed in an atmosphere containing 18O2. On the other hand, oxygen may be obligatory since there was almost complete inhibition when the reaction was performed in an atmosphere consisting of nitrogen. Carbon monoxide did not inhibit the reaction. One atom of deuterium was incorporated into the product when the reaction was performed in a medium containing deuterated water. It was concluded that microsomal 24-hydroxylation of 3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic acid involves the combined action of a desaturase and a hydratase. The reaction catalyzed by the hydratase appears to be stereospecific since the 24alpha epimer of 3alpha, 7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic acid was the predominant product. In contrast to the microsomal system, the mitochondrial system was not stimulated by the addition of ATP and was not inhibited by coenzyme A. The coenzyme A ester of 3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic acid was 24-hydroxylated more efficiently than the free acid."

The enterotoxin activity is acid-labile and is destroyed by heating at 65 degrees for 30 min. It is suggested that the heat-stable enterotoxin material is derived from heat-labile enterotoxin by forming a complex with endotoxin or capsular material present in the culture supernatant."

https://openalex.org/W1519918229,"Abstract The GTP-dependent initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAi) binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), binds mRNA, as well as Met-tRNAi with high affinity and both RNA species appear to bind to the 48,000-dalton subunit of eIF2. Binding of mRNA by eIF2 produces an alteration in its molecular configuration resulting in dissociation of component subunits as assayed by isoelectric focusing. In contrast, GTP, GDP, or Met-tRNAi produce no subunit dissociation. Phosphorylation of the 37,000-dalton eIF2 subunit by the heme-controlled translational repressor does not alter the ability of mRNA to produce subunit dissociation of eIF2. A role for mRNA binding by eIF2 in initiation of protein synthesis or in recycling of eIF2, or both, is postulated."
https://openalex.org/W2103674703,"At pH 8.0 aspartate aminotransferase (L-aspartate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.1) reacts with the modified substrate, erythro-beta-hydroxy-L-aspartate, to form a mixture of enzyme-substrate complexes absorbing at 492 nm. A variety of dicarboxylic acids were studied spectrophotometrically as competitive inhibitors of this reaction. All of the inhibitory dicarboxylic acids form a complex with the enzyme, absorbing at 362 nm. In addition, some of the dicarboxylic acids form a protonated complex absorbing at about 435 nm. This complex, which is the conjugate acid of that absorbing at 362 nm, is formed only by those dicarboxylic acids which can assume a configuration in which the two carboxyl groups are positioned as in maleic acid. Bulky substituents, such as aromatic rings or even methyl groups, prevent the formation of the protonated complex, presumably because of steric restrictions at the active site. Substitution of the central carbon atom of glutaric acid by heteroatoms of increasing charge density results in a progressive decrease in inhibitory effectiveness, at pH 8, primarily due to a loss of this pH-dependent stabilization of the enzyme-dicarboxylic acid complex. Acids with an aromatic ring are among the most potent dicarboxylic acid inhibitors of this enzyme in spite of the fact that they do not undergo the pH-dependent stabilization of their enzyme complexes. From these observations it was concluded that the affinity of aspartate aminotransferase for dicarboxylic acids is determined as much by the mechanism of binding as by the solvation and steric effects."

https://openalex.org/W1553705747,"The more than 2,300-fold purification of a DNA polymerase from the embryos of Drosophila melanogaster is described. The enzyme, which forms a single band on gel electrophoresis, has a molecular weight of about 87,000 and a pH optimum of 8.5. A divalent metal is required for activity, Mg2+ being preferred with activated DNA, Mn2+ with homopolymer template-primers. The enzyme is inactivated completely by mercurials; polyamines are also inhibitory with certain templates. The most efficient template-primer is activated DNA, but homopolymers such as poly(dA)-oligo(dT), poly(A)-oligo(dT), and poly(A)-oligo(U) are also utilized with high efficiency. The purified enzyme preparations appear to be devoid of nuclease activity when assayed directly with suitable substrates. In addition, neither primer nor product is degraded after prolonged incubation with the enzyme. In accordance with previous observations on other DNA polymerases, the Drosophila enzyme can replicate single-stranded DNA only under conditions of simultaneous transcription by RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1563823194,"Rabbit reticulocytes contain two RNA isoaccepting species for histidine as resolved by various chromatographic methods, while rabbit liver contains only one. These isoacceptors cannot be distinguished on the basis of coding properties, consistent with the Wobble Hypothesis (Smith, D.W.E., Meltzer, V.N., and McNamara, A.L. (1974) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 349, 366-375). Their function in hemoglobin synthesis in reticulocyte lysates has been investigated. Each of the tRNA isoacceptors of reticulocytes and the tRNA species of liver can incorporate histidine into positions in hemoglobin encoded by both of the histidine code words, CAC and CAU, and it is likely that each can incorporate histidine into all of the histidine-containing positions of hemoglobin. Even in experiments in which the two histidine tRNA species of reticulocytes are placed together in a lysate and are therefore in competition with each other, each incorporates histidine into all of the histidine-containing positions. There is no evidence that any residues are incorporated preferentially by either of the tRNA species. The two species are attached to reticulocyte ribosomes in the same proportion as they occur in the reticulocyte, also suggesting that neither of them is used preferentially in hemoglobin synthesis. The first of the two reticulocyte histidine isoacceptors and the histidine tRNA of rabbit liver contain Q base."
https://openalex.org/W1592808398,"[14C]Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), obtained by reductive methylation of the purified initiation factor, was shown to be active in the unfractionated reticulocyte lysate. This allowed a direct measurement of the endogenous pool size of eIF-2 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate according to the principle of isotope dilution. A value of 20 to 30 pmol/ml of lysate was obtained. Although translational inhibition resulting from hemin deficiency appears to be characterized by a change from catalytic to stoichiometric utilization of eIF-2, the pool size of eIF-2 is too small to account for the normal period of protein synthesis before the onset of translation inhibition. This suggests, therefore, that additional events to eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation may be required for translational inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W1573884092,"D-Ribose isomerase, which catalyzes the conversion of D-ribose to D-ribulose, was purified from extracts of Mycobacterium smegmatis grown on D-ribose. The purified enzyme crystalized as hexagonal plates from a 44% solution of ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was homogenous by disc gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugal analysis. The molecular weight of the enzyme was between 145,000 and 174,000 by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. Its sedimentation constant of 8.7 S indicates it is globular. On the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis in the presence of Mn2+, the enzyme is probably composed of 4 identical subunits of molecular weight about 42,000 to 44,000. The enzyme was specific for sugars having the same configuration as D-ribose at carbon atoms 1 to 3. Thus, the enzyme could also utilize L-lyxose, D-allose, and L-rhamnose as substrates. The Km for D-ribose was 4 mM and for L-lyxose it was 5.3 mM. The enzyme required a divalent cation for activity with optimum activity being shown with Mn2+. the Km for the various cations was as follows: Mn2+, 1 times 10(-7) M, Co2+, 4 times 10(-7) M, and Mg2+, 1.8 times 10(-5) M. The pH optimum for the enzyme was 7.5 to 8.5. Polyols did not inhibit the enzyme to any great extent. The product of the reaction was identified as D-ribulose by thin layer chromatography and by preparation of the O-nitrophenylhydrazone derivative."
https://openalex.org/W1563665062,"Chick embryo tRNA charged with [3H]glycine was incubated in an in vitro protein-synthesizing system using polysomes isolated from either chick embryo liver or calvaria. Using collagenase digestion to measure the fraction of protein synthesized which was collagenous, the results indicate that in the calvaria system approximately 65% of the incorporated [3H]glycine was in collagen. The incorporation of [3H]glycine into protein from individual isoaccepting species was determined by chromatography on a reversed phase system of the charged tRNA before and after incubation in the polysome systems. In the calvaria system, a single tRNAGly species cognate to GGU and GGC and which is found in unusually large amounts in collagen-synthesizing tissues was used preferentially in collagen-synthesizing tissues was used preferentially in collagen synthesis. In the liver system, the rate of incorporation was similar to the calvaria, but no collagen synthesis was detected and only a relatively small preferential usage of any of the four major isoaccepting species was observed. These results support the notion that the complement of tRNA found in a cell may be adapted to the synthesis of a particular protein. It is also possible that under certain circumstances, collagen synthesis may be controlled in vivo at the translational level by the concentration of particular tRNA species."
https://openalex.org/W1527613718,"Equilibrium and calorimetric studies of substrate binding to turkey egg white (TEW) lysozyme were carried out at 30degrees as a function of pH (2 to 9) and ligand size (monosaccharide to hexasaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine). Steady state kinetic measurements using the N-acetylglucosamine hexasaccharide were carried out as a function of pH (2 to 9) and temperature (20-60degrees). These experiments allow comparison of the properties of TEW lysozyme with those of the hen egg white (HEW) enzyme reported previously (Banerjee, S. K., Holler, E., Hess, G. P., and Rupley, J. A. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4355-4367, and references therein). The free energies and enthalpies of oligosaccharide binding are the same for TEW and HEW lysozymes at pH 2 but are less negative for TEW lysozyme at pH 5. The pH dependence of the binding of (GlcNAc)3 and higher oligomers to TEW lysozyme is like that for the binding of beta-methyl-N-acetylglucosaminide to TEW lysozyme. These data indicate that oligosaccharide ligands bind identically with HEW and TEW lysozymes, except for the interactions of residue 101, which is aspartic acid in the HEW protein and glycine in the TEW protein (Larue, J. N., and Speck, J. C., Jr. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 1985-1991). The pH dependence of kcat is described by apparent pK values of 3.9 and 6.8 and a maximum value of kcat of 0.135 s-1. A value of 21.0 kcal/mol was calculated for deltaH from the temperature dependence of kcat. These values and the dependence of the transglycosylation reaction on acceptor concentration are within experimental error the same as those for HEW lysozyme. The more acid pK seen in the pH rate profile reflects the ionization of Asp-52 in the lysozyme-(GlcNAc)6 complex. The pK of Asp-52 in the free protein is 0.3 pK unit lower. The essential identity of the active sites of the HEW and TEW enzymes, except for the Asp-101 interactions, allows estimation of the thermodynamic properties associated with formation of the two hydrogen bonds between Asp-101 and substrate as deltaG0 = -1.2 kcal/mol, DeltaH0 = -3.6 kcal/mol, and deltaS0 = -7.9 e.u."
https://openalex.org/W1536820588,"Difference spectra associated with changes in pH and with binding of saccharides have been recorded for hen egg white (HEW) lysozyme, turkey egg white (TEW) lysozyme, and for the derivatives of the hen protein in which Tre-62 or Trp-108 had been oxidized specifically to oxindolealanine to give the Oxa-62 or Oxa-108-proteins. Identical pH difference spectra were obtained for HEW, TEW, and Oxa-62-lysozymes. Oxidation of Trp-108 is reflected in both the high and low pH (pH 7 versus 5 and pH 2 versus 5) difference spectra. The magnitude of the low pH difference spectrum is enhanced by binding of saccharide for HEW and Oxa-62-lysozymes but not for TEW lysozyme. The shapes and magnitudes of saccharide binding difference spectra are affected by oxidation of residues 62 or 108. These results can be interpreted in terms of the perturbations responsible for the lysozyme difference spectra. The pH 7 versus 5 difference spectrum results from perturbation by Glu-35 of Trp-108 and another tryptophan, probably Trp-63. Perturbation of Trp-108 and one or more other tryptophan residues by several carboxylate groups is responsible for the low pH difference spectra of the unliganded HEW and TEW lysozyme molecules. Perturbation of Trp-108 makes a principal contribution to the saccharide-binding difference spectrum. Perturbation of the Oxa-108 chromophore by ionization of Glu-35 or by saccharide binding produces absorbance changes in the 250 to 265 nm region."

https://openalex.org/W1969959059,Friend leukemia cells incubated with sublethal concentrations of histidinol for 5 to 6 days show up to twofold increases in their relative concentrations of histidine transfer RNA and no change in the relative concentrations of leucine transfer RNA. A similar effect is seen when cells are grown to stationary phase in the presence of 0.2 times the amount of histidine in Eagle's minimum essential medium. These observations support the theory that the concentrations of specific transfer RNA's are regulated by a mechanism that is sensitive to the extent of their aminoacylation.
