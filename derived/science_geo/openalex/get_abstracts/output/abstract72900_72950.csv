https://openalex.org/W1511715485,"Polysomes of rat liver appear to be either attached to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum or free in the cytoplasm. It has been postulated that attached ribosomes are engaged in the synthesis of secretory proteins while free ribosomes make nonexportable proteins. Experimental support for this hypothesis has been obtained by studying the site of synthesis of serum proteins, an example of secretory proteins, and of ferritin, an example of a nonexportable protein. Two to three minutes after an intravenous injection of 3H-leucine into the rat there is equal and maximum incorporation, per mg of RNA, into trichloracetic acid-insoluble proteins bound to both free and attached ribosomes. The newly formed protein attached to the ribosomes was released by treatment with spermine and puromycin. About 80% of the newly formed serum protein recovered by this method was obtained from the attached ribosomes. The radioactive ferritin, however, was found to occur in the proteins released from the free ribosomes. Similar results were obtained by incubating free and attached polysomes (microsomes) in vitro with radioactive amino acids and under conditions for protein synthesis. Again, over 80% of the protein synthesized by attached ribosomes was found to be serum proteins, and the free ribosomes made 7 to 20 times more ferritin than did attached ribosomes. The radioactive proteins were detected and isolated by precipitation with specific antisera and the specificity of the methods checked by a combination of immunoelectrophoresis and autoradiography."

https://openalex.org/W2127874307,"Energy-dependent transport of the folic acid analogue, methotrexate, was studied in L1210 murine leukemia cells. A number of metabolic inhibitors were found to enhance the unidirectional influx and accumulation of methotrexate. This phenomenon was studied in detail with sodium azide. The azide-induced increase in the unidirectional influx of methotrexate was associated with a rise in both the maximum transport velocity and the influx Michaelis constant. The effect of azide on influx was not related to an increase in the passive diffusion of methotrexate. Addition of pyruvate, an energy substrate for those metabolic processes inhibited by azide, was found to depress methotrexate influx in the presence and absence of azide. The unidirectional efflux of methotrexate was slowed by azide. Efflux from cells loaded to high levels of methotrexate in the presence of azide was a two-component process with the major part of intracellular methotrexate exiting at a slow and constant velocity. The data suggested that azide reduces the maximum transport velocity and the Michaelis constant for the unidirectional efflux process. In the absence of azide the electrochemical potential for intracellular methotrexate exceeds that for extracellular methotrexate. The data indicate that azide further increases this electrochemical potential difference. These studies therefore suggest that energy-dependent transport of methotrexate is enhanced in the presence of azide in the L1210 leukemia cell."

https://openalex.org/W1997958669,"Some highly purified glycolytic enzymes have been subjected to isoelectric focusing and found to contain a number of enzymatically active species. Crystalline aldolase A and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle were resolved into five components, crystalline aldolase from yeast was resolved into three components, pyruvate kinase from rabbit muscle yielded four components, and yeast enolase was resolved into two components. Rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase (M4) gave one major peak of protein and enzymatic activity. The profiles of aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and yeast aldolases suggest random combinations of two closely related subunits into tetramers and dimers, respectively. The molecular heterogeneity of the other enzymes is not so easily related to subunit structure."

https://openalex.org/W1481275482,"Abstract The reaction of p-mercuribenzoate with the —SH groups in position 93 of the β chains of human hemoglobin has been studied spectrophotometrically by a stopped flow method. The apparent second order rate constant is 50 to 80 times larger for oxyhemoglobin than for deoxyhemoglobin. This difference, which is similar to that found for other —SH reagents, is taken to reflect an intramolecular conformational change which occurs in hemoglobin upon binding of ligands. The reaction of the —SH groups with p-mercuribenzoate is a fast process, and can be made to occur in the same time range as the uptake of heme ligands (as O2 or CO). Thus, the reaction of the mercurial with the β93 —SH groups of freshly formed oxyhemoglobin was compared to that of aged oxyhemoglobin. The two rates were found to be identical. This experiment indicates that this ligand-dependent conformational transition in hemoglobin is a rapid process which is complete in a millisecond or less. Moreover, the uptake of p-mercuribenzoate by the β93—SH groups of hemoglobin is linearly related to the binding of CO throughout the progress of the reaction. This finding suggests that the reactivity of the —SH group is dependent exclusively on the presence of the ligand on the β chains, and is independent of the state, liganded or not, of the α chains."

https://openalex.org/W1678859393,"Abstract 1. Ammonium chloride is a poor uncoupler of photophosphorylation in subchloroplast particles. In the presence of valinomycin the inhibition of photophosphorylation by NH4Cl is greatly enhanced. 2. The enhancement of the ammonium chloride uncoupling of phosphorylation by valinomycin was less pronounced in chloroplasts than in subchloroplast particles. 3. The light-dependent uptake of ammonium ions by chloroplasts was abolished by valinomycin which also caused a rapid release of the ions accumulated during illumination. The uptake of ammonium ions in subchloroplast particles was only 5 to 10% of that in chloroplasts, whereas phosphorylation in subchloroplast particles was generally about 50% of that in chloroplasts. 4. The light-dependent uptake of hydrogen ions by chloroplasts, assayed in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride, was not affected by valinomycin. In subchloroplast particles, valinomycin had no effect on hydrogen ion uptake in the absence of ammonium chloride. In the presence of this uncoupler, valinomycin enhanced hydrogen ion uptake. 5. The uncoupling of ferricyanide-dependent phosphorylation in subchloroplast particles by ethylamine was not affected by valinomycin. In the presence of valinomycin, the inhibition of phosphorylation by ammonium chloride was partly relieved by ethylamine. 6. These results are interpreted in view of the chemiosmotic theory of oxidative phosphorylation. It is proposed that phosphorylation in chloroplasts is dependent upon a hydrogen ion gradient. In subchloroplast particles, however, a membrane potential may be required for adenosine triphosphate synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2011739505,"It has been postulated that certain schizophrenic patients are in a state of continual central excitation and that improvement in these patients after treatment with chlorpromazine is a result of the action of the drug in reducing this excitation. A model was developed to test this postulated state of central excitation. Rats were electrically stimulated in the mesencephalic reticular formation while performing a simple attention task. Stimulation or treatment with chlorpromazine impaired the performance of the animals; however, the two treatments together resulted in performance indistinguishable from that seen after injections of saline alone."
https://openalex.org/W1537035128,"Abstract A simple procedure for the isolation of large quantities of crystalline fructose diphosphate aldolase from rabbit livers is described. The enzyme is homogeneous as judged by its electrophoretic and sedimentation behavior. Molecular weight determinations by sedimentation analysis and gel filtration yield a value of 158,000. Upon treatment with guanidine hydrochloride or sodium dodecyl sulfate the enzyme dissociates into monomers of molecular weight of approximately 39,000, indicating a tetrameric quaternary structure. Although the molecular weight and quaternary structure of liver aldolase are similar to those of the muscle enzyme, the two enzymes differ significantly in their chemical properties. The amino acid composition of liver aldolase is distinctly different from that of the muscle enzyme especially with respect to methionine, serine, and aromatic amino acids. Digestion with carboxypeptidase A, as well as hydrazinolysis, indicates that the carboxyl-terminal amino acid is glycine, whereas the carboxyl-terminal residue in the muscle enzyme is tyrosine. Subsequent amino acids liberated by carboxypeptidase also differ from those released from the muscle enzyme. These differences in the COOH-terminal regions of the liver and muscle aldolases may represent a structural basis for their different catalytic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1506815516,"Abstract The effect of exogenous glucosamine on the incorporation of lysine-14C, uridine-14C, and thymidine-14C into various normal and experimental tumor tissues was studied. Glucosamine at high concentrations markedly inhibited the incorporation of these precursors into protein, RNA, and DNA of Walker carcinosarcoma 256 of rats and of sarcoma 180 and C3H spontaneous mammary tumor of mice. Glucose or pyruvate did not reverse the inhibition by glucosamine. The effect of exogenous glucosamine in vitro on the incorporation of the labeled precursors into normal tissues was much less than that into neoplastic tissues. N-Acetylglucosamine and many other sugars tested showed little inhibition of protein, RNA, and DNA synthesis. The only inhibitory sugars, other than glucosamine, were D-mannosamine, D-galactosamine, and D-mannose."
https://openalex.org/W1583010828,Abstract Organ-specific highly basic protein derived from guinea pig central nervous system myelin was found to be electrophoretically heterogeneous. It did not appear to be heterogeneous with respect to molecular size. The electrophoretic technique used to demonstrate this heterogeneity was capable of resolving mixtures of closely related basic proteins whether they were present in crude extracts or in relatively pure preparations. Multiple forms of this basic protein were present in extracts obtained from whole tissue under conditions designed to minimize artifactitious changes as well as in a purified basic protein obtained directly from isolated myelin. This observation suggested that multiple forms may exist in situ. Analyses of various acid extracts of brain and liver by the same electrophoretic technique provided evidence that myelin basic protein was the only highly basic protein specific to brain which was present in significant amounts in these extracts. Extracts prepared from brain with 0.1 m acetic acid contained myelin basic protein free of other highly basic proteins.
https://openalex.org/W1550396058,"Abstract The highly purified binding enzyme from rabbit reticulocytes is found to function in enzymatic binding of phenylalanyl transfer RNA to ribosomes, ribosome and aminoacyl RNA-dependent hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate, and as a factor required for the synthesis of peptides. Interdependent reactions are indicated. Guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphate analogue, 5'-guanylyl methylene diphosphonate, appear to act as competitive inhibitors of guanosine triphosphate in the enzymatic binding reaction. It is concluded that guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis is involved at this step in the sequence of reactions of peptide bond formation. Conversely, guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis is not limited by enzymatic binding, is not dependent upon polyuridylic acid, and appears not to involve a codonanticodon interaction between aminoacyl transfer RNA and messenger RNA. Data are presented that are relevant to the determination of binding enzyme activity in the binding reaction, as a guanosine triphosphatase, and in the synthesis of peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1542064370,"Abstract The induction of ferritin was studied in suspension cultures of HeLa cells. New synthesis of apoferritin was assessed by the incorporation of 14C-leucine into ferritin, the labeled protein being isolated from the cells by antibody precipitation after a preliminary purification in the presence of carrier human ferritin. Apoferritin synthesis was found to be accelerated by incubation with iron salts, the effect being maximal throughout the concentration range of 10 to 100 µg of iron per ml. The stimulation was specific for ferritin as opposed to the general mixture of cell proteins, and was specific for iron among the heavy metal ions tested. The response to added iron was immediate in experiments that could have detected a 10-min lag. Bipyridyl largely prevented the stimulatory effect of iron, whereas deferoxamine prevented cellular uptake of iron and even removed much iron previously incorporated into cellular ferritin. No measurable breakdown of carbon-labeled ferritin was observed in a 4-hour incubation of deferoxamine-treated cells. This speaks against the idea that iron-deficient ferritin has a rapid turnover and that added iron causes accumulation of ferritin merely by stabilizing it. Actinomycin failed to prevent the stimulatory effect of iron, thus contradicting the gene level hypothesis for the short term control of ferritin synthesis. Actinomycin in fact enhanced the effect of iron. A translational inhibitor may be proposed to explain the result, and perhaps to represent the receptor for iron in its role in ferritin induction."

https://openalex.org/W1570157435,"Abstract The rates of combination of the isolated chains of human hemoglobin with oxygen have been measured by flash photolysis and stopped flow methods. The two experimental methods give similar results, and furthermore the data compare well with those obtained recently by the temperature jump relaxation method. The measured association rates are compared with the values predicted from the previously measured equilibrium and dissociation rate constants. A significant discrepancy is noted in the case of the β chains. In addition, the rates of replacement of oxygen by carbon monoxide as functions of the relative ligand concentrations have been measured, and the observed dependences are compared to those predicted from the equilibrium and kinetic constants for the individual liganding reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1586307765,"Abstract Extracts of subcellular fractions isolated from rat brain homogenates were obtained by treatment of the lyophilized preparations with 0.1 n HCl. When the extracts were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the only ones found to contain significant amounts of highly basic proteins were those of myelin and nuclei. The electrophoretic patterns of highly basic proteins from nuclei resembled those of calf thymus histones, whereas the patterns of the highly basic protein obtained from myelin appeared to be unique. Highly basic protein, electrophoretically identical with that extracted from isolated myelin, was also obtained from whole tissue. It was extracted from whole rat spinal cord and brain initially treated with chloroform-methanol by subsequent treatment with dilute acid at pH 3.0. At this pH, no highly basic proteins were extracted from similarly treated whole rat liver. Thus, the myelin basic protein can be obtained free of non-myelin basic proteins merely by controlling the pH of of the extraction. Subsequent treatment of both liver and brain with 0.1 n HCl removed additional basic proteins which were electrophoretically identical with those extracted from isolated brain nuclei. The present study confirms earlier observations that rat myelin basic protein consists of multiple electrophoretic forms. The additional data presented support the conclusion that the multiple forms are not artifacts attributable either to the conditions of extraction or the conditions of electrophoresis. The electrophoretic heterogeneity of rat myelin basic protein is considerably greater than that which has been observed in myelin basic protein of other species."

Subjects were required to press a single lever and remain motionless for 2 seconds during which time unit activity from several brain sites was recorded. One of the tones, randomly designated, was sounded halfway through this period. Manipulation of drive states revealed that the highest activity was associated with tones announcing the reinforcement for which the animal was most strongly motivated. Thus, from a hungry animal sustained or increased firing rates were elicited by a "" food"" tone and differentially lowered rates by the other tones."
https://openalex.org/W1596012539,"Abstract Bovine pancreas tryptophanyl transfer RNA synthetase, a crystalline enzyme, is shown by filtration on a carefully calibrated Sephadex G-150 column and by equilibrium centrifugation to have a molecular weight of 110,000 (s20,w = 5.6) in the presence of 10-4 M tryptophan. When the enzyme is treated with 4 M guanidine-hydrochloride for several days or with 8 M urea, values for the s20,w become 1.6 and 2.0, respectively. The enzyme dissociates slowly (to s20,w = 3.0) on dialysis against Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.5, or 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.8. A very slow dissociation is caused by 0.2 M β-mercaptoethanol which is rapidly speeded up on the addition of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Titration of native enzyme with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) indicates the presence of four free —SH groups; titration in the presence of 8 M urea indicates six —SH groups; titration of sodium borohydride-reduced enzyme indicates 14 —SH groups per molecule of 110,000 molecular weight. The enzyme has been reduced with 0.2 M β-mercaptoethanol in 8 M urea and carboxymethylated with 14C-iodoacetic acid. The carboxymethylated protein is eluted as a single peak in a position corresponding to a particle with a molecular weight of 27,000 to 30,000 from a Sephadex G-150 column. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments show a single molecular weight species of 27,000 (s20,w = 1.9). However, chromatography on carboxymethyl-Sephadex separates the carboxymethylated protein into two distinct radioactive protein peaks. The carboxymethylated proteins were acetylated, digested with trypsin, and subjected to peptide mapping. A total of seven 14C-cysteine peptides and 22 arginine-containing peptides was identified in both protein species, while the amino acid composition of the total unfractionated carboxymethylated protein shows 14 carboxymethylcysteine residues and 44 arginine residues per molecule of 110,000 molecular weight. The amino acid compositions of the two separated carboxymethylated proteins show significant differences, one carrying 6 half-cysteine residues, the other only 1. Catalytic hydrazinolysis of the individual carboxymethylated proteins gives 1 mole of glutamic acid and 1 mole of glycine, respectively, per 27,000 molecular weight. These experiments lead to the conclusion that a molecule of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase is made up of four subunits per molecular weight of 110,000. These subunits consist of two kinds of monomers with different primary structures. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase activity is not restricted to the tetrameric protein but is also found in a smaller molecular species (s20,w = 3.0 to 3.3). This molecule is found naturally in preparations of the enzyme and is also formed on dissociation of the tetrameric enzyme. These findings and those reported in the accompanying paper suggest that the catalytic form of the enzyme, the protomer, may be a dimer, and that the tetrameric form has no special functional significance and most likely is an artifact produced by the presence of tryptophan during the purification procedure."

The results suggest that the binding of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine to lysozyme is significantly different from that of other monosaccharide inhibitors, that the value of k1 for monosaccharide inhibitors is significantly different from that for the di- and trisaccharide, and that the phenomenon measured by nuclear magnetic resonance methods is the same as that measured by temperature jump methods."

https://openalex.org/W1496236402,"Abstract A cell-free system from rabbit reticulocytes incorporated 14C-valine and 14C-leucine into hemoglobin. This synthesis of rabbit hemoglobin was inhibited in a specific manner when α or β chains, isolated from human hemoglobin, were added to the system. The human α and β chains interacted with the newly synthesized 14C-rabbit chains to form hybrid hemoglobins, which were identified by cellulose acetate electrophoresis, and the amount of 14C-rabbit hemoglobin was decreased. When human β chains were added to the reaction, there was also a 40 to 50% decrease in the amount of the 14C-rabbit β chain component in the supernatant fraction and an increase in the amount of completed 14C-β chains in the ribosome fraction, as determined by chain separation chromatography of these fractions on carboxymethyl cellulose columns. The supernatant phase also contained an electrophoretic fraction with the properties of free 14C-rabbit β chains; this fraction was not detected in the system incubated without human β chains. Addition of hemin at the beginning of the reaction largely prevented the change in distribution of β chain radioactivity between supernatant and ribosome fractions caused by human β chains. It is suggested that, during rabbit hemoglobin synthesis, a pool of α chains, endogenous to the soluble phase of the reaction, aided in the release or solubilization of some of the completed rabbit β chains from the ribosome fraction. Human β chains, when added to the reaction, interacted with the α chains to prevent them from aiding in this release. Under these conditions some of the newly synthesized rabbit β chains were released as free chains, while others remained bound to the ribosomes. Addition of hemin to the reaction prevented the accumulation of ribosome-bound chains by aiding in their release. The enhanced release of newly synthesized β chains by soluble α chains or hemin may be part of a translational control mechanism in hemoglobin assembly; however, the presence of free 14C-β chains in the supernatants of reactions containing human β chains suggests that α chains were not required absolutely for this release."
https://openalex.org/W1508942004,"Abstract It was suggested by previous workers that the C-26 oxygenation step in the biosynthetic conversion of cholesterol to tigogenin ((25R)-5α,22β-spirostan-3β-o1) requires the intermediacy of a C-24 double bond. To examine the validity of this hypothesis, (25-3H)-cholesterol was synthesized, and (4-14C)-(25-3H)-cholesterol (3H:14C ratio, 7.0) was administered to two Digitalis samen plants. A method of isolating the transformation products of tigogenin from the crude saponin mixture, under conditions which did not induce the loss of the C-25 proton, was developed. The (25ξ)-(25-3H)-(4-14C)-5α-cholestan-3β, 16ξ, 22ξ, 26-tetrol was isolated, and its 3H:14C ratio (6.96) was found to be identical with that of the (25-3H)-(4-14C)-cholesterol administered. Jones' oxidation of the tetrol gave (25ξ)-(25-3H)-(4-14C)-3, 16,22-triketo-5α-cholestan-26-oic acid, which on base-catalyzed equilibration lost all the tritium. It was concluded that the C-26 oxygenation of cholesterol during its biosynthetic conversion to tigogenin in D. samen, does not require the intermediacy of a C-24 (or C-25) double bond."

Further elution of these columns with 0.5M NaCl removes both the permeability factor and residual choleragenic toxin. When this latter material is chromatographed on columns of carboxymethyl-Sephadex, the permeability factor toxin is eluted by 0.02M phosphate buffer and is free of choleragenic activity. Therefore, choleragenic and permeability factor activities of the type 2 cholera toxins are different and can be separated by these procedures."
https://openalex.org/W1531473362,"Abstract The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) of Azotobacter vinelandii has been obtained as a homogeneous protein of high and constant specific activity.

The purification was dependent on the recognition of the existence of a 14 S species, presumably a degradation product of the polymerase, and its removal by fractionation. This 14 S material is stable in low salt buffers and has a low and variable polymerase activity. The stability and behavior of the 23 S species has been examined by analytical sedimentation under a variety of conditions of pH and ionic strength; after aging; and in the presence of sulfhydryl compounds, Mg2+, and other reagents. The amino acid composition and free sulfhydryl groups have been determined."
https://openalex.org/W1577087822,"The formation of catalytically active enzyme·metal·glucose phosphate complexes involving the metal ion series, Zn2+, Co2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, and Cd2+, was studied by means of both ultraviolet difference and solvent perturbation spectroscopy. Metal-specific differences were observed in the three-dimensional structure of these complexes which suggest that the size of a crevice in the enzyme·substrate complex can be either reduced or expanded through binding of the appropriate bivalent metal ion. Furthermore, crevice size can be correlated with enzyme activity: the larger the alteration of crevice size on metal binding the lower the enzymatic activity, whether the change involves reduction or expansion in size. These observations suggest that the metal ion plays a dual role in the phosphoglucomutase system: it serves both as a catalytic entity and as a modifier of enzyme activity through its effect on enzyme structure."

The differences in amplitude and phase shifts between neutrons and x-rays resulted in a neutron diffraction pattern that was completely different from the x-ray pattern. The neutron pattern consisted of a single peak of about 89-angstrom spacing in the region examined (up to 6-angstrom spacing).

This reaction was found to be catalyzed by L -amino acid oxidase ( L -amino acid:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating), EC 1.4.3.2). In the presence of catalase, 0.48 µmole of oxygen was consumed for each micromole of substrate oxidized, and 1 µmole each of S-adenosyl-γ-thio-α-ketobutyrate and ammonia were formed. In the absence of catalase oxygen consumption was doubled. The pH optimum for S-adenosyl-γ-thio-α-ketobutyrate formation ranged from 8.8 to 9.2 and the Km value for S-adenosyl- L -homocysteine was 2.48 × 10−2 M . At substrate concentrations of 10 m M and at pH 9.0, the ratio of specific activities with S-adenosyl- L -homocysteine to that with L -leucine or with L -methionine was 0.31 and 0.41, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1524459023,"Abstract By digital computer simulation, it was shown that a sequential mechanism for the 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid-dependent (DPGA-dependent) muscle phosphoglyceric acid mutase reaction cannot be disproved by kinetic analysis of the available velocity data, contrary to the suggestion of Grisolia and Cleland (Biochemistry, 7, 1115 (1968)). At the high concentrations of DPGA and 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PGA) used in the experimental velocity assay, the rates of product formation calculated from the sequential and the ping-pong mechanisms were found to be very similar; possible experiments to distinguish them are suggested. A sequential mechanism model (supported by other types of experimental data) was fitted to the velocity data over the range 0.5 µM to 6 mM DPGA and 1 to 40 mM 3PGA. Calculated kinetic parameter values are presented. Competitive substrate inhibitions required 2 molecules of 3PGA bound per molecule of apoenzyme, and 1 of DPGA bound per phosphoglyceric acid mutase-DPGA complex. At high 3PGA and DPGA the enzyme protein is modified into a form with an increased turnover number as a function of 3PGA and DPGA concentrations. Binding constants depend on the ligand concentrations, in accord with experiment."
