https://openalex.org/W2939093246,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Tumor cells and associated healthy cells form ecosystems that determine disease progression and response to therapy. To characterize features of breast cancer ecosystems and their associations with clinical data, we analyzed 144 human breast tumor and 50 non-tumor tissue samples using mass cytometry. The expression of 73 proteins in 26 million cells was evaluated using tumor and immune cell-centric antibody panels. Tumors displayed individuality in tumor cell composition, including phenotypic abnormalities and phenotype dominance. Relationship analyses between tumor and immune cells revealed characteristics of ecosystems related to immunosuppression and poor prognosis. High frequencies of PD-L1+ tumor-associated macrophages and exhausted T cells were found in high-grade ER+ and ER- tumors. This large-scale, single-cell atlas deepens our understanding of breast tumor ecosystems and suggests that ecosystem-based patient classification will facilitate identification of individuals for precision medicine approaches targeting the tumor and its immunoenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2938255062,"Summary Whole-genome-sequencing (WGS) of human tumors has revealed distinct mutation patterns that hint at the causative origins of cancer. We examined mutational signatures in 324 WGS human-induced pluripotent stem cells exposed to 79 known or suspected environmental carcinogens. Forty-one yielded characteristic substitution mutational signatures. Some were similar to signatures found in human tumors. Additionally, six agents produced double-substitution signatures and eight produced indel signatures. Investigating mutation asymmetries across genome topography revealed fully functional mismatch and transcription-coupled repair pathways. DNA damage induced by environmental mutagens can be resolved by disparate repair and/or replicative pathways, resulting in an assortment of signature outcomes even for a single agent. This compendium of experimentally induced mutational signatures permits further exploration of roles of environmental agents in cancer etiology and underscores how human stem cell DNA is directly vulnerable to environmental agents.

https://openalex.org/W2923745223,"Genome sequences are known for two archaic hominins-Neanderthals and Denisovans-which interbred with anatomically modern humans as they dispersed out of Africa. We identified high-confidence archaic haplotypes in 161 new genomes spanning 14 island groups in Island Southeast Asia and New Guinea and found large stretches of DNA that are inconsistent with a single introgressing Denisovan origin. Instead, modern Papuans carry hundreds of gene variants from two deeply divergent Denisovan lineages that separated over 350 thousand years ago. Spatial and temporal structure among these lineages suggest that introgression from one of these Denisovan groups predominantly took place east of the Wallace line and continued until near the end of the Pleistocene. A third Denisovan lineage occurs in modern East Asians. This regional mosaic suggests considerable complexity in archaic contact, with modern humans interbreeding with multiple Denisovan groups that were geographically isolated from each other over deep evolutionary time."

However, in its typical implementation, the tradeoffs between fields of view, acquisition speeds, and depth restrictions in scattering brain tissue pose severe limitations. Here, using an integrated systems-wide optimization approach combined with multiple technical innovations, we introduce a new design paradigm for optical microscopy based on maximizing biological information while maintaining the fidelity of obtained neuron signals. Our modular design utilizes hybrid multi-photon acquisition and allows volumetric recording of neuroactivity at single-cell resolution within up to 1 × 1 × 1.22 mm volumes at up to 17 Hz in awake behaving mice. We establish the capabilities and potential of the different configurations of our imaging system at depth and across brain regions by applying it to in vivo recording of up to 12,000 neurons in mouse auditory cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and hippocampus."

By applying lineage-targeted single-cell transcriptomics, we uncover an unanticipated diversity of glial progenitor pools with unique molecular identities in developing brain. Our analysis identifies distinct transitional intermediate states and their divergent developmental trajectories in astroglial and oligodendroglial lineages. Moreover, intersectional analysis uncovers analogous intermediate progenitors during brain tumorigenesis, wherein oligodendrocyte-progenitor intermediates are abundant, hyper-proliferative, and progressively reprogrammed toward a stem-like state susceptible to further malignant transformation. Similar actively cycling intermediate progenitors are prominent components in human gliomas with distinct driver mutations. We further unveil lineage-driving networks underlying glial fate specification and identify Zfp36l1 as necessary for oligodendrocyte-astrocyte lineage transition and glioma growth. Together, our results resolve the dynamic repertoire of common and divergent glial progenitors during development and tumorigenesis and highlight Zfp36l1 as a molecular nexus for balancing glial cell-fate decision and controlling gliomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2939200041,"By releasing glutamate, astrocytes actively regulate synaptic transmission and contribute to excitotoxicity in neurological diseases. However, the mechanisms of astrocytic glutamate release have been debated. Here, we report non-vesicular release of glutamate through the glutamate-permeable volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). Both cell swelling and receptor stimulation activated astrocytic VRAC, which requires its only obligatory subunit, Swell1. Astrocyte-specific Swell1 knockout mice exhibited impaired glutamatergic transmission due to the decreases in presynaptic release probability and ambient glutamate level. Consistently, the mutant mice displayed hippocampal-dependent learning and memory deficits. During pathological cell swelling, deletion of astrocytic Swell1 attenuated glutamate-dependent neuronal excitability and protected mice from brain damage after ischemic stroke. Our identification of a new molecular mechanism for channel-mediated glutamate release establishes a role for astrocyte-neuron interactions in both synaptic transmission and brain ischemia. It provides a rationale for targeting VRAC for the treatment of stroke and other neurological diseases associated with excitotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2936216122,"Yeast ataxin-2, also known as Pbp1, senses the activity state of mitochondria in order to regulate TORC1. A domain of Pbp1 required to adapt cells to mitochondrial activity is of low sequence complexity. The low-complexity (LC) domain of Pbp1 forms labile, cross-β polymers that facilitate phase transition of the protein into liquid-like or gel-like states. Phase transition for other LC domains is reliant upon widely distributed aromatic amino acids. In place of tyrosine or phenylalanine residues prototypically used for phase separation, Pbp1 contains 24 similarly disposed methionine residues. Here, we show that the Pbp1 methionine residues are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated oxidation in vitro and in living cells. Methionine oxidation melts Pbp1 liquid-like droplets in a manner reversed by methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymes. These observations explain how reversible formation of labile polymers by the Pbp1 LC domain enables the protein to function as a sensor of cellular redox state."
https://openalex.org/W2939263494,"It is largely unclear whether genes that are naturally embedded in lamina-associated domains (LADs) are inactive due to their chromatin environment or whether LADs are merely secondary to the lack of transcription. We show that hundreds of human promoters become active when moved from their native LAD position to a neutral context in the same cells, indicating that LADs form a repressive environment. Another set of promoters inside LADs is able to ""escape"" repression, although their transcription elongation is attenuated. By inserting reporters into thousands of genomic locations, we demonstrate that escaper promoters are intrinsically less sensitive to LAD repression. This is not simply explained by promoter strength but by the interplay between promoter sequence and local chromatin features that vary strongly across LADs. Enhancers also differ in their sensitivity to LAD chromatin. This work provides a general framework for the systematic understanding of gene regulation by repressive chromatin."

Here, we show that synchronization of the cell cycle in Drosophila embryos requires accurate nuclear positioning, which is regulated by the cell-cycle oscillator through cortical contractility and cytoplasmic flows. We demonstrate that biochemical oscillations are initiated by local Cdk1 inactivation and spread through the activity of phosphatase PP1 to generate cortical myosin II gradients. These gradients cause cortical and cytoplasmic flows that control proper nuclear positioning.

We conclude that mitotic synchrony is established by a self-organized mechanism that integrates the cell-cycle oscillator and embryo mechanics. Embryonic development is controlled by dynamic biochemical signals that trigger changes in the organization of the cytoskeleton and of the cytoplasm and thereby of the mechanical properties of the embryo (Gilmour et al., 2017Gilmour D.

Changes in the physical properties of the embryo can, in turn, feed back to biochemical dynamics, suggesting that morphogenesis requires the integration of biochemical and mechanical signals, possibly through the generation of self-organized circuits (Gross et al., 2017Gross P.

However, the molecular principles underlying this integration remain poorly understood, making it difficult to quantitatively and predictably describe embryonic development on a macroscopic scale. A powerful model system to dissect the integration of biochemistry and mechanics during morphogenesis is provided by the cleavage divisions of the Drosophila embryo. After fertilization, the fruit fly embryo undergoes 13 rounds of DNA replication and mitosis without cytokinesis, resulting in a multinucleated syncytium containing ∼6,000 nuclei (Farrell and O’Farrell, 2014Farrell J.A.

Morphol. 1941; 69: 1-49Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). These nuclear cycles are controlled by oscillations in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and mitotic phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A (Heim et al., 2017Heim A. Rymarczyk B. Mayer T.U.

PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins at mitotic exit is controlled by inhibitor-1 and PP1 phosphorylation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The first cleavage divisions are accompanied by a series of nuclear movements; by cycle 10, movements result in a hollow shell at the surface of the embryo where nuclei are uniformly distributed (Figure 1A) (Foe and Alberts, 1983Foe V.E. Alberts B.M. Studies of nuclear and cytoplasmic behaviour during the five mitotic cycles that precede gastrulation in Drosophila embryogenesis.J. Cell Sci. 1983; 61: 31-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the first 3 rounds of division, where no significant nuclear movement is observed, nuclei spread along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis during cell cycles 4–6 in a process called axial expansion (Zalokar and Erk, 1976Zalokar M. Erk I. Division and migration of nuclei during early embryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Microsc. Biol. Cell. 1976; 25: 97-106Google Scholar). Subsequently, in cell cycles 7–9, nuclei migrate progressively to the embryo surface (Baker et al., 1993Baker J. Theurkauf W.E. Schubiger G. Dynamic changes in microtubule configuration correlate with nuclear migration in the preblastoderm Drosophila embryo.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) where they undergo 4 rounds of blastoderm divisions, which gradually slow down without losing synchrony. Two conceptually distinct, although not mutually exclusive, models have been proposed for how nuclei spread across the AP axis (Royou et al., 2002Royou A. Sullivan W. Karess R. Cortical recruitment of nonmuscle myosin II in early syncytial Drosophila embryos: its role in nuclear axial expansion and its regulation by Cdc2 activity.J.

How an actin network might cause fountain streaming and nuclear migration in the syncytial Drosophila embryo.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1637-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), a process known to be driven by actomyosin contractility (Hatanaka and Okada, 1991Hatanaka K. Okada M. Retarded nuclear migration in Drosophila embryos with aberrant F-actin reorganization caused by maternal mutations and by cytochalasin treatment.Development. 1991; 111: 909-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Zalokar and Erk, 1976Zalokar M. Erk I. Division and migration of nuclei during early embryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Microsc. Biol. Cell. 1976; 25: 97-106Google Scholar). The first model, here referred to as the local disassembly model, proposes that actin around nuclei partially disassembles during interphase, and this local decrease in tension causes streaming of the cytoplasm and the nuclei toward the poles (von Dassow and Schubiger, 1994von Dassow G. Schubiger G. How an actin network might cause fountain streaming and nuclear migration in the syncytial Drosophila embryo.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1637-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The second model, here referred to as the cortical contraction model, proposes that cycles of myosin II-driven cortical contraction generate cytoplasmic flows that push nuclei along the AP axis (Royou et al., 2002Royou A. Sullivan W. Karess R. Cortical recruitment of nonmuscle myosin II in early syncytial Drosophila embryos: its role in nuclear axial expansion and its regulation by Cdc2 activity.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These two models require different assumptions about the mechanisms coupling cell-cycle dynamics and nuclear movement, which have been shown to be tightly linked (Foe et al., 1993Foe V.E. Odell G.M. Edgar B.A. Mitosis and morphogenesis in the Drosophila embryo: point and counterpoint.in: The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1993: 149-300Google Scholar). In the first model, local cell-cycle dynamics are sufficient to couple nuclear cycles and cytoskeletal rearrangements; conversely, the second model requires a mechanism that couples nuclear dynamics and cortical contractility over the relatively large distance (∼40 μm) separating nuclei from the cortex. Our current understanding of the spatial regulation of the cell cycle is unable to distinguish between these two models. On the one hand, Cdk1 activity is high in most of the cytoplasm during the first 9 cell cycles (Edgar et al., 1994Edgar B.A. Sprenger F. Duronio R.J. Leopold P. O’Farrell P.H. Distinct molecular mechanism regulate cell cycle timing at successive stages of Drosophila embryogenesis.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, Su et al., 1998Su T.T. Sprenger F. DiGregorio P.J. Campbell S.D. O’Farrell P.H. Exit from mitosis in Drosophila syncytial embryos requires proteolysis and cyclin degradation, and is associated with localized dephosphorylation.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1495-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), while it is locally inactivated through degradation of a small pool of cyclins around the nuclei (Huang and Raff, 1999Huang J. Raff J.W. The disappearance of cyclin B at the end of mitosis is regulated spatially in Drosophila cells.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2184-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Consistent with the local disassembly model of nuclear spreading, local oscillations of Cdk1 can drive actin disassembly in a small region surrounding the nuclei (von Dassow and Schubiger, 1994von Dassow G. Schubiger G. How an actin network might cause fountain streaming and nuclear migration in the syncytial Drosophila embryo.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1637-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). On the other hand, pharmacological perturbations of Cdk1 dynamics, which have been shown to interfere with cortical myosin II dynamics (Royou et al., 2002Royou A. Sullivan W. Karess R. Cortical recruitment of nonmuscle myosin II in early syncytial Drosophila embryos: its role in nuclear axial expansion and its regulation by Cdc2 activity.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), argue in favor of the cortical contraction model. It remains unclear how cortical and cell-cycle dynamics are coupled and whether this involves waves of Cdk1 activity, similar to those observed at the later blastoderm cycles (Deneke et al., 2016Deneke V.E. Melbinger A. Vergassola M. Di Talia S. Waves of Cdk1 Activity in S Phase Synchronize the Cell Cycle in Drosophila Embryos.Dev.

Mitotic waves in the early embryogenesis of Drosophila: Bistability traded for speed.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115: E2165-E2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the coupling could be mediated by the activity of mitotic phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. During mitosis, the activity of Cdk1 is high, while PP1 and PP2A activities are low (Grallert et al., 2015Grallert A. Boke E. Hagting A. Hodgson B. Connolly Y. Griffiths J.R. Smith D.L. Pines J. Hagan I.M. A PP1-PP2A phosphatase relay controls mitotic progression.Nature. 2015; 517: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, Heim et al., 2017Heim A. Rymarczyk B. Mayer T.U. Regulation of Cell Division.in: Pelegri F. Danilchik M. Sutherland A. Vertebrate Development: Maternal to Zygotic Control. Springer International Publishing, 2017: 83-116Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The decrease in Cdk1 activity at mitotic exit results in activation of mitotic phosphatases, which is further sharpened by several feedback mechanisms (Grallert et al., 2015Grallert A. Boke E. Hagting A. Hodgson B. Connolly Y. Griffiths J.R. Smith D.L. Pines J. Hagan I.M. A PP1-PP2A phosphatase relay controls mitotic progression.Nature. 2015; 517: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, Mochida et al., 2010Mochida S. Maslen S.L. Skehel M. Hunt T.

Tang W. Yang C.S. Freel C.D. Chen C. Nairn A.C. Kornbluth S. PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins at mitotic exit is controlled by inhibitor-1 and PP1 phosphorylation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). How the activities of PP1 and PP2A are regulated spatially, and whether they play a role in nuclear positioning, remains unknown. Cytoplasmic flows represent a mechanism for large scale coordination of nuclear movements, provided their directionality and strength are regulated to ensure precise nuclear positioning. Nuclear spreading could potentially feedback on cell-cycle synchrony because the distribution of nuclei across the embryo determines the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (NC ratio), which correlates with the duration of the nuclear divisions (Farrell and O’Farrell, 2014Farrell J.A. O’Farrell P.H. From egg to gastrula: how the cell cycle is remodeled during the Drosophila mid-blastula transition.Annu. Rev.

DNA-replication checkpoint control at the Drosophila midblastula transition.Nature. 1997; 388: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). During the later blastoderm cycles, an increase in the NC ratio reduces the DNA replication capacity of the embryo and triggers the activation of the DNA replication checkpoint, which causes a gradual slowdown of the cell cycle (Farrell and O’Farrell, 2014Farrell J.A. O’Farrell P.H. From egg to gastrula: how the cell cycle is remodeled during the Drosophila mid-blastula transition.Annu. Rev.

DNA-replication checkpoint control at the Drosophila midblastula transition.Nature. 1997; 388: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and plays an important role in the regulation of mitotic synchrony (Deneke et al., 2016Deneke V.E. Melbinger A. Vergassola M. Di Talia S. Waves of Cdk1 Activity in S Phase Synchronize the Cell Cycle in Drosophila Embryos.Dev. Cell. 2016; 38: 399-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, we have generated imaging and computational tools to determine the mechanisms of nuclear positioning and cell-cycle synchronization during early Drosophila development. We demonstrate that cell-cycle synchronization emerges from the ability of nuclei to self-organize their positioning by regulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of the cell cycle, cortical contractions, and cytoplasmic streaming. We show that local Cdk1 downregulation at mitotic exit initiates the damped spreading of PP1 activity, which is responsible for recruiting myosin II to cortical regions that surround the nuclei, where gradients of contractility are generated. These gradients drive cortical and cytoplasmic flows that properly position the nuclei across the embryo. Such spatial organization ensures a homogeneous NC ratio and synchronous embryo-wide oscillations of Cdk1 and PP1 activities at the maternal-to-zygotic transition. To elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the emergence of cell-cycle synchronization in the Drosophila embryo, we first measured detailed spatiotemporal activity profiles of major cell-cycle regulators. To this end, we used a biosensor that undergoes a conformational change increasing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency upon phosphorylation by Cdk1 (Figure 1B) (Deneke et al., 2016Deneke V.E. Melbinger A. Vergassola M. Di Talia S. Waves of Cdk1 Activity in S Phase Synchronize the Cell Cycle in Drosophila Embryos.Dev. Cell. 2016; 38: 399-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Gavet and Pines, 2010Gavet O. Pines J. Progressive activation of CyclinB1-Cdk1 coordinates entry to mitosis.Dev. Cell. 2010; 18: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that the dephosphorylation of the biosensor and the consequent decrease in FRET efficiency was triggered by PP1 activity (Figures S1A and S1B; STAR Methods). Thus, at each time interval during the cell cycle, the biosensor (referred to as Cdk1/PP1 biosensor) reports the ratio of Cdk1/PP1 activities. Quantification of the emission ratio of the Cdk1/PP1 biosensor near the embryo surface shows that the Cdk1/PP1 ratio exhibited a disorganized pattern of activity in cell cycles 4–6 (Figure 1C). After cell cycle 6, oscillations became synchronous and persisted until cell cycle 14 (Figure 1C). Spatial analysis of the Cdk1/PP1 biosensor dynamics revealed that oscillations were restricted to regions of the cortex surrounding the nuclei (Figure 1D). To display Cdk1/PP1 activity in both space and time, we used a heatmap representation where color indicates activity, the x axis is the time coordinate, and the y axis the coordinate along the AP axis. We found that the oscillatory pattern of Cdk1/PP1 activity at the surface of the embryo gradually spreads along the AP axis during cell cycles 4–6 (Figure 1E). By cell cycle 7, the Cdk1/PP1 biosensor oscillated synchronously throughout the entire embryo (Figure 1E). Importantly, even though nuclei are located at the embryo mid-plane during the first 9 cycles, the region that displayed localized oscillations near the cortex is located 40 μm above the nuclei (Figures 1E, dotted ellipses, and S1C). The Cdk1/PP1 oscillations expanded in a manner that closely mirrors the expansion of the nuclear cloud (Figure 1E). Taken together, our measurements argue that during the early cell cycles, the oscillations in the Cdk1/PP1 activity ratio at the surface of the embryo closely follow the position of the nuclei located at embryo mid-plane. To further elucidate the relation between the Cdk1/PP1 oscillations at the cortex and around the nuclei, we performed measurements of the Cdk1/PP1 biosensor activity in the axial direction (Figure 1F). Biosensor oscillations in the cytoplasm close to the cortex were damped compared to oscillations in a region 30 μm inside the embryo (Figure 1F), as well as along the AP axis (Figure S1D). To obtain further quantitative insights on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Cdk1/PP1 biosensor, we measured the dephosphorylation rate, defined as the slope of the temporal decrease of the FRET signal at mitotic exit. Quantification of this rate in the axial direction showed a gradual decrease moving from the inner-most plane to the surface of the embryo (Figure 1G), confirming that the Cdk1/PP1 activity oscillations are the strongest around the nuclei and reduce as the surface of the embryo is approached. To further test the role of nuclei, we imaged activated, unfertilized eggs, which did not undergo nuclear proliferation. Importantly, newly laid unfertilized eggs did not show effective oscillations of the biosensor (Figure S1E), highlighting the importance of nuclei in initiating oscillations in the Cdk1/PP1 activity ratio. Collectively, our results demonstrate that local oscillations of Cdk1/PP1 initiate around the nuclei and spread radially in a damped manner. These oscillations reach the surface of the embryo and could couple nuclear and cortical dynamics. To confirm and elucidate the coupling between nuclear and cortical dynamics, we dissected the respective contribution of Cdk1 and PP1 to the oscillations of the biosensor. To determine whether oscillations at the surface of the embryo were due to downregulation of Cdk1 activity through cyclin degradation, we measured cyclin-B dynamics using 2-photon and confocal imaging of a functional GFP-cyclin-B trap line. Consistent with previous findings, cyclin-B levels only oscillated in a small region around the nuclei (Figures 2A, blue line, and S2A) (Huang and Raff, 1999Huang J. Raff J.W. The disappearance of cyclin B at the end of mitosis is regulated spatially in Drosophila cells.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2184-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). At the cortex, cyclin-B levels did not oscillate until the nuclei reached the surface of the embryo at cell cycle 9 (Figure 2A, red line). Spatial analysis of cyclin-B dynamics at the surface confirmed lack of local oscillations during early divisions (Figure S2B). Finally, we found that the dynamics of the Cdk1/PP1 biosensor was unaltered in embryos mutant for Wee1, a kinase playing a major role in the regulation of Cdk1 activity (Morgan, 2007Morgan D.O. The cell cycle: principles of control. New Science Press, 2007Google Scholar) (Figure S2C). The upshot is that the local cytoplasmic oscillations of the Cdk1/PP1 biosensor are not due to cyclin degradation or post-translational regulation of Cdk1, thus pointing at the role of PP1 activity.Figure S2Biosensor Dynamics Near the Surface of Early Embryos Is Regulated by PP1 Activity Rather Than Cdk1, Related to Figure 2Show full captionA) APC activity at mitotic exit as a function of distance from chromosomes in 2 embryos.

D) Emission ratio of Cdk1/PP1 FRET sensor at the surface of a wild-type embryo (blue line) or an embryo in which I-2 levels are highly reduced by mutations (red line). p < 10−10 (χ2 test). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the dynamics of the biosensor in embryos heterozygous for two genes encoding maternally expressed PP1α (hereby referred as PP1-heterozygous) (Kirchner et al., 2007Kirchner J. Gross S. Bennett D. Alphey L. Essential, overlapping and redundant roles of the Drosophila protein phosphatase 1 alpha and 1 beta genes.Genetics. 2007; 176: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We observed that oscillations of the biosensor near the surface during the early cell cycles were damped in PP1-heterozygous embryos compared to wild-type embryos (Figure 2B). This was due to reduced dephosphorylation rates (Figure 2C), indicating that PP1 is rate-limiting for dephosphorylation of the sensor. Spatial analysis of the Cdk1/PP1 biosensor showed delayed oscillations at the poles compared to wild-type (Figures 2D and 2E). The importance of PP1 in the spatial regulation of the cell cycle was further supported by decreasing the levels of Inhibitor-2, a major regulator of PP1 activity (Figure S2D). The above results collectively support the following model for the spatial regulation of the cell cycle. Upon mitotic entry, Cdk1 activity is uniformly high in the embryo, while PP1 activity is uniformly low (Figure 2F). At mitotic exit, cyclins are degraded in a small region surrounding the nuclei, which results in a local decrease of Cdk1 activity (Figure 2F) and PP1 activation. PP1 is then able to stimulate its own activity, which extends to a spatial region of ∼50 μm that reaches cortical regions surrounding the nuclear cloud (Figure 2F). Thus, our experiments argue that, similarly to the Cdk1/PP1 biosensor, other mitotic targets are dephosphorylated by PP1 in a region extending from the nuclei to the surrounding surface of the embryo (Figure 2F). Based on these data, we hypothesize that PP1 is responsible for coupling nuclear and cortical dynamics by driving the recruitment of myosin II to regions of the cortex surrounding the nuclear cloud. To demonstrate the role of PP1 activity in the recruitment and positioning of myosin II at the cortex, we measured both Cdk1/PP1 and myosin II light chain dynamics (Video S1) simultaneously in early embryos. Spatial analysis of cortical myosin II dynamics showed that myosin II accumulated in regions where the Cdk1/PP1 biosensor featured oscillations (Figures 3A–3D). In addition, myosin II recruitment closely followed the expansion of the Cdk1/PP1 oscillations along the AP axis (Figures 3A and 3C). Using a moesin-ABD-GFP transgenic line, we visualized and quantified F-actin dynamics at the cortex, which closely matched myosin II dynamics both in space and time (Figures S3A and S3B). Cortical recruitment of F-actin and myosin II depend on Rho1 (Royou et al., 2002Royou A. Sullivan W. Karess R. Cortical recruitment of nonmuscle myosin II in early syncytial Drosophila embryos: its role in nuclear axial expansion and its regulation by Cdc2 activity.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Using a biosensor of Rho activity (Munjal et al., 2015Munjal A. Philippe J.M. Munro E. Lecuit T. A self-organized biomechanical network drives shape changes during tissue morphogenesis.Nature. 2015; 524: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we found that Rho activity displayed spatial dynamics that closely matched that of myosin II (Figures 3E and 3F). Rho activity peaks simultaneously with PP1 activity, as revealed by the low Cdk1/PP1 ratios at the maximum of Rho activity (Figure 3G, dotted line). The peak in Rho activity is followed by a peak in myosin II with a delay of 1–2 min (Figure 3G). This suggests that the delay between PP1 activation and myosin II accumulation is largely due to the time needed for myosin II activation by Rho. Both activation of Rho and recruitment of myosin II were reduced in PP1-heterozygous embryos (Figures 3H and S3I), which further establishes the importance of PP1 in regulating actomyosin cortical contractility during the early cycles.Figure S3Quantification of Myosin II, F-Actin, and Rho Activities in Early Development, Related to Figure 3Show full captionA) Myosin II and F-actin (measured by Moesin-ABD-GFP) levels as a function of time in anterior (left) or post"

Circadian rhythms provide adaptive value by promoting expression of diverse physiological processes and behaviors at specific times of the day. In mammals, rhythms in hormone release, rest/activity cycles, body temperature, and metabolism are all controlled by the multi-oscillator system of pacemakers in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus. Numerous studies have documented that the SCN uses hormonal and neuronal signaling to provide adaptive phasic information across all times of day (Lehman et al., 1987Lehman M.N. Silver R.

However, the information connecting SCN signaling to neural circuits that translate its outputs is fragmentary. Lacking direct in vivo experimental observations, the definition of circadian output networks remains a significant challenge. In Drosophila, a prominent circadian output is the daily locomotor activity rhythm, which peaks once around dawn and again around dusk (Figure 1B). The rhythm is controlled by molecular clocks that cycle synchronously within ∼150 circadian pacemaker neurons (Nitabach and Taghert, 2008Nitabach M.N. Taghert P.H. Organization of the Drosophila circadian control circuit.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: R84-R93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Among these circadian neurons, two separate groups (termed M cells and E cells) control the morning (M) and evening (E) activity peaks (Stoleru et al., 2004Stoleru D. Peng Y. Agosto J. Rosbash M.

Insect Physiol. 2004; 50: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that different groups of circadian neurons display rhythmic but asynchronous circadian neural activity in vivo: they peak at different yet stereotyped times of day (Liang et al., 2016Liang X. Holy T.E. Taghert P.H. Synchronous Drosophila circadian pacemakers display nonsynchronous Ca2+ rhythms in vivo.Science. 2016; 351: 976-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These neural activity rhythms depend on their synchronous molecular clocks, but their activity peak times are staggered by neuropeptide-mediated interactions between circadian neuron groups. This allows the network to create multiple phasic time points (Liang et al., 2017Liang X. Holy T.E. Taghert P.H. A series of suppressive signals within the Drosophila circadian neural circuit generates sequential daily outputs.Neuron. 2017; 94: 1173-1189.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Consequently, M cells peak in the morning and E cells peak in the evening. The distinct peak times of M cells and E cells could potentially guide output motor circuits to generate independent morning and evening locomotor behavioral peaks. To support this emerging network view of pacemaker-regulated behavior, we wished to ask which pre-motor centers transduce circadian timing signals to generate morning or evening phase-specific locomotor activity. As a strategy, we reasoned that spontaneous neural activity patterns corresponding to the daily bimodal activity pattern could help identify the critical pre-motor elements. Robie et al., 2017Robie A.A. Hirokawa J. Edwards A.W. Umayam L.A. Lee A. Phillips M.L. Card G.M. Korff W. Rubin G.M. Simpson J.H. et al.Mapping the neural substrates of behavior.Cell. 2017; 170: 393-406.e28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar performed an unbiased screen of sparsely labeled neuronal groups to determine which, when activated, could initiate locomotor activity. By this analysis, the strongest candidates were the ring neurons of the ellipsoid body (EB-RNs) (Figure 1A). In parallel, silencing these same EB-RNs reduced spontaneous locomotor activity (Martín-Peña et al., 2014Martín-Peña A. Acebes A. Rodríguez J.R. Chevalier V. Casas-Tinto S. Triphan T. Strauss R. Ferrús A. Cell types and coincident synapses in the ellipsoid body of Drosophila.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2014; 39: 1586-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). EB-RNs are a subset of neurons that constitute the central complex, the primary locomotor control center in insects (Strauss and Heisenberg, 1993Strauss R. Heisenberg M.

Organization and functional roles of the central complex in the insect brain.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2014; 59: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). EB-RNs encode visual landmarks for visuospatial-memory-based orientation and navigation (Neuser et al., 2008Neuser K. Triphan T. Mronz M. Poeck B. Strauss R.

In the monarch butterfly, EB-RNs are involved in sun-compass navigation (Heinze and Reppert, 2011Heinze S. Reppert S.M. Sun compass integration of skylight cues in migratory monarch butterflies.Neuron. 2011; 69: 345-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which requires timing information from circadian clocks (Froy et al., 2003Froy O.

Several recent studies have linked activity in subsets of the EB-RN to the regulation of sleep-wake physiology. Liu et al., 2016Liu S. Liu Q. Tabuchi M. Wu M.N.

In addition, two independent groups described synaptic links between a subset of the DN1 group of circadian pacemakers to subgroups of EB-RNs (Lamaze et al., 2018Lamaze A. Krätschmer P. Chen K.F.

DN1 cells integrate outputs from M and E cells and regulate both locomotor activity and sleep (Zhang et al., 2010Zhang Y. Liu Y. Bilodeau-Wentworth D. Hardin P.E. Emery P.

Circadian neuron feedback controls the Drosophila sleep--activity profile.Nature. 2016; 536: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured spontaneous activity in EB-RNs in vivo first, to see whether they represent a point of convergent circadian regulation that could lead to daily bouts of locomotor activity. To test whether EB-RNs regulate circadian locomotor activity, we expressed tetanus toxin light chain (TeTn, Sweeney et al., 1995Sweeney S.T. Broadie K. Keane J. Niemann H. O’Kane C.J. Targeted expression of tetanus toxin light chain in Drosophila specifically eliminates synaptic transmission and causes behavioral defects.Neuron. 1995; 14: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) to block neurotransmission in the majority of ∼60 EB-RNs. As expected, the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in these flies was impaired under constant darkness (DD), as was the general level of activity (Figures 1B, 1C, and Table S1). Then, to learn about the possible involvement of the EB-RNs in normal rhythmic locomotion, we measured in vivo spontaneous activity exhibited by these neurons in otherwise wild-type flies. Using the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6s (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar), we performed in vivo Ca2+ imaging in living flies for 24 h using methods previously described (Liang et al., 2016Liang X. Holy T.E. Taghert P.H. Synchronous Drosophila circadian pacemakers display nonsynchronous Ca2+ rhythms in vivo.Science. 2016; 351: 976-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Liang et al., 2017Liang X. Holy T.E.

A series of suppressive signals within the Drosophila circadian neural circuit generates sequential daily outputs.Neuron. 2017; 94: 1173-1189.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). EB-RNs contain several genetically and morphologically distinct subgroups (Renn et al., 1999aRenn S.C.P. Armstrong J.D. Yang M. Wang Z. An X. Kaiser K. Taghert P.H. Genetic analysis of the Drosophila ellipsoid body neuropil: organization and development of the central complex.J. Neurobiol. 1999; 41: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We dissected four EB-RN subgroups using different genetic drivers that use regulatory sequences associated with different circadian clock-related genes: one with sequences from timeless, one from cryptochrome, and two from pdfr (pigment-dispersing factor receptor) (Figures 1D–1G and S1A). In both 12-h light to 12-h dark (LD) cycles and in DD conditions, the four different EB-RN subgroups we tested displayed spontaneous, daily Ca2+ rhythms (Figures 1D–1G and Figures S2A–S2D). These dynamic signals were not a consequence of rhythmic GCaMP6 sensor expression (Figures S3A–S3F). The average Ca2+ activity profile of each subgroup was bimodal (Hartigans’ dip test, LD: p < 0.0001, DD: p < 0.05), with a peak around dawn and another around dusk. At these two peaks, with high-frequency-light-sheet imaging (1 Hz), we found that many EB-RNs showed an increase in the incidence and magnitude of fast spontaneous activity events (Figure S3G). The two daily peaks corresponded to the times of day when flies showed daily locomotor activity peaks (Figure 1B). The outer subgroup of EB-RNs caused the strongest effects on locomotor activity, according to Robie et al., 2017Robie A.A. Hirokawa J. Edwards A.W. Umayam L.A. Lee A. Phillips M.L. Card G.M. Korff W. Rubin G.M. Simpson J.H. et al.Mapping the neural substrates of behavior.Cell. 2017; 170: 393-406.e28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar. We tested the same split-GAL4 drivers as reported by Robie et al., 2017Robie A.A. Hirokawa J. Edwards A.W. Umayam L.A. Lee A. Phillips M.L. Card G.M. Korff W. Rubin G.M. Simpson J.H. et al.Mapping the neural substrates of behavior.Cell. 2017; 170: 393-406.e28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar and found that these locomotion-promoting EB-RNs likewise displayed a similar spontaneous daily bimodal activity pattern (Figure S1B; Hartigans’ dip test, p < 0.0001). We also confirmed the daily bimodal activity pattern exhibited by different EB-RN subgroups using a separate, circadian-clock-irrelevant driver line to label the majority of EB-RNs (Figures 1H and S2E; Hartigans’ dip test, LD: p < 0.001, DD: p < 0.01). To test the correlation between EB-RN neural activity and locomotor activity in single flies in our experimental paradigm directly, we performed in vivo 24-h Ca2+ imaging while simultaneously measuring spontaneous leg movements as a proxy for locomotor activity levels (Figure 2A). EB-RN activity was strongly correlated with such behavioral activity in individual flies, both at a daily timescale (Figures 2F–2K) and at a shorter (hourly) timescale (Figures 2C–2E and S4E–S4L). Analysis of the shorter timescale indicated that increases in EB-RN activity were coincident with increases in behavioral activity; decreases typically preceded decreases in behavioral activity by a few minutes (Figure 2E). We noted that, under DD, the imaged flies (Figure 2F) showed higher locomotor activity around the middle of subjective day than did freely moving flies (Figure 1B, right panel). The increase in activity during the middle of the subjective day was not caused by illumination of the specimen during imaging (Figures S4A–S4C) and was not observed under LD conditions. Under LD, both the locomotor activity and EB-RN activity clearly showed two daily peaks. Thus, EB-RNs, consistent with their documented roles as pre-motor activity centers, exhibit spontaneous daily neural activity rhythms that precisely correspond to the pattern of circadian locomotor rhythms. The daily neural activity rhythms in EB-RNs could reflect rhythmic sensory inputs, either proprioceptive or visual. For example, recent studies suggest that EB-RNs encode self-motion information (Shiozaki and Kazama, 2017Shiozaki H.M. Kazama H. Parallel encoding of recent visual experience and self-motion during navigation in Drosophila.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, to block ascending proprioceptive sensory inputs, we transected connectives between the brain and ventral nerve cord (between subesophageal and first thoracic neuromeres) immediately before Ca2+ imaging. EB-RNs still displayed normal bimodal activity rhythms (Figure 3A). These EB-RN rhythms persisted even when the entire body of the fly was removed immediately before imaging (Figure 3B). Therefore, spontaneous bimodal EB-RN activity rhythms are not a consequence of locomotor behavioral activity. Previous studies also showed that EB-RNs receive large-scale visual inputs (Seelig and Jayaraman, 2013Seelig J.D. Jayaraman V. Feature detection and orientation tuning in the Drosophila central complex.Nature. 2013; 503: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, Omoto et al., 2017Omoto J.J. Keleş M.F. Nguyen B.M.

Hermundstad A.M. Jayaraman V. Neural signatures of dynamic stimulus selection in Drosophila.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 1104-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we removed visual inputs by testing flies in DD (Figure 1) or by testing genetically blind norpAP24 mutant flies (Figure 3C): in both cases, normal EB-RN activity rhythms persisted. Together, these results indicate that neither visual nor proprioceptive inputs are necessary for spontaneous EB-RN activity rhythms. To determine whether EB-RN activity rhythms are driven by molecular clocks, we measured Ca2+ activity in circadian-defective per01 (null) mutant flies (Konopka and Benzer, 1971Konopka R.J. Benzer S. Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1971; 68: 2112-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar), which fail to display circadian clock-dependent anticipatory behavior. Although per01 flies still had two peaks of startle responses (to the lights-on and lights-off stimuli under LD cycles), daily Ca2+ activity patterns in EB-RNs were arrhythmic (Figure 3D). Therefore, EB-RN activity rhythms specifically correlate with—and entirely depend on—circadian clock signals that regulate daily behavioral peaks. Notably, EB-RNs do not exhibit measurable expression of the core clock gene period, which is highly expressed and cycles in circadian pacemaker neurons (Figure S1C) (Kaneko and Hall, 2000Kaneko M. Hall J.C. Neuroanatomy of cells expressing clock genes in Drosophila: transgenic manipulation of the period and timeless genes to mark the perikarya of circadian pacemaker neurons and their projections.J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 422: 66-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Furthermore, manipulations that alter the pace of circadian clocks in a subset of circadian neurons shifted the phase of locomotor activity phases, as previously reported (Stoleru et al., 2005Stoleru D. Peng Y. Nawathean P. Rosbash M. A resetting signal between Drosophila pacemakers synchronizes morning and evening activity.Nature. 2005; 438: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, Yao and Shafer, 2014Yao Z. Shafer O.T. The Drosophila circadian clock is a variably coupled network of multiple peptidergic units.Science. 2014; 343: 1516-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), while the same manipulation within EB-RNs did not affect locomotor behavior (Figures S1D–S1F). Thus, we conclude that daily EB-RN activity rhythms are downstream of circadian timing information provided by circadian pacemaker neurons. To test whether circadian neurons regulate EB-RNs, we impaired a crucial signal within the pacemaker network, the neuropeptide PDF (Renn et al., 1999bRenn S.C. Park J.H. Rosbash M. Hall J.C.

Hwang S. et al.Drosophila GPCR Han is a receptor for the circadian clock neuropeptide PDF.Neuron. 2005; 48: 267-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the EB-RNs’ activity pattern under LD transformed to a daily unimodal one (Hartigans’ dip test, p = 0.23): the morning activity peak was lost, and the evening peak was advanced (Figure 3E; Watson-Williams test, p = 0.00012). This neural activity pattern mirrors the changes in locomotor activity pattern typically displayed by pdfrhan5304 flies. Meanwhile, EB-RNs responded to thermogenetic and pharmacogenetic activation of PDF-releasing neurons (Figures S5A and S5B). Thus, EB-RN activity rhythms could be driven (directly or indirectly) by PDF-expressing circadian pacemaker neurons. In contrast to EB-RNs, all circadian pacemaker neurons showed single daily peaks of activity. This difference suggested that the daily two-peak activity pattern of EB-RNs could be generated by a combination of different circadian neuronal outputs. We considered the simplest model, that M cells could drive a morning activity peak in EB-RNs while E cells could independently drive EB-RN evening activity. To begin to test this possibility, we determined that EB-RNs responded to the selective activation of M cells (four s-LNv) by ATP application to brains expressing ATP-gated cation channel P2X2 (Lima and Miesenböck, 2005Lima S.Q. Miesenböck G. Remote control of behavior through genetically targeted photostimulation of neurons.Cell. 2005; 121: 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) in M cells (Figure 4A) first. A similar design to selectively activate E cells, the 5th s-LNv and three PDFR-positive LNd (Im and Taghert, 2010Im S.H. Taghert P.H. PDF receptor expression reveals direct interactions between circadian oscillators in Drosophila.J. Comp. Neurol. 2010; 518: 1925-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), produced correspondent EB-RN responses of comparable amplitude (Figures 4B, 4C, and S5D–S5F). These results support the proposition that both M cells and E cells have functional connections with EB-RNs. Then, as a more stringent test, we asked whether selectively accelerating M or E oscillators would selectively influence the phase of either the morning and/or evening peak of EB-RN Ca2+ activity. Overexpressing shaggy (SSG) using pdf-GAL4 (M-cell > SGG) to accelerate the molecular clocks selectively in morning oscillators advanced the morning peak of locomotor activity (cf. Stoleru et al., 2005Stoleru D. Peng Y. Nawathean P. Rosbash M. A resetting signal between Drosophila pacemakers synchronizes morning and evening activity.Nature. 2005; 438: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and the M-cell activity peak (Figures 4D–4F). In these flies, we found that only the morning peak of EB-RN Ca2+ activity was phase-advanced, while their evening Ca2+ peak phase was unaffected (Figure 4G). This result suggests that the morning peak of EB-RN activity is dictated predominantly by the phase of M cell activity. In parallel, we asked whether the evening peak of EB-RNs is dictated by the phase of E cell activity. Overexpressing SGG in E cells by using a split-GAL4 line, GMR_MB122B (Liang et al., 2017Liang X. Holy T.E. Taghert P.H. A series of suppressive signals within the Drosophila circadian neural circuit generates sequential daily outputs.Neuron. 2017; 94: 1173-1189.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), selectively advanced the evening behavioral peak (Figure 4H) and the E-cell activity peak (Figure 4J). In these flies, we found that only the evening peak of EB-RN Ca2+ activity was phase-advanced and was by comparable amplitude to what we previously observed with M cell acceleration and M peak advance (Figure 4I). Taken together, these results reveal essential circuit links to demonstrate that M cells and E cells can independently dictate the two distinct phases of EB-RN pre-motor activity. None of the ∼150 circadian pacemaker neurons in Drosophila project directly to the EB (Helfrich-Förster, 2005Helfrich-Förster C. Neurobiology of the fruit fly’s circadian clock.Genes Brain Behav. 2005; 4: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked through which interneurons M cells and E cells might regulate daily neural activity in EB-RNs. A set of two dopaminergic (DA) neurons (named PPM3-EB) appeared as prominent candidates, as they innervate the EB. Further, they can initiate locomotor activity and promote ethanol-induced locomotor activity (Kong et al., 2010Kong E.C. Woo K. Li H. Lebestky T. Mayer N. Sniffen M.R. Heberlein U. Bainton R.J. Hirsh J. Wolf F.W. A pair of dopamine neurons target the D1-like dopamine receptor DopR in the central complex to promote ethanol-stimulated locomotion in Drosophila.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9954Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). First, we established that PPM3-EB neurons displayed a daily bimodal neural activity pattern in vivo spontaneously (Hartigans’ dip test, p < 0.0001), similarly to that of the EB-RNs and consistent with their putative involvement in the daily profile of locomotor activity (Figure 5A). To study the precise relationship between activity in EB-RNs and that in PPM3-EBs, we employed dual-color Ca2+ imaging in single fly brains (Figure 5B). This method separated Ca2+ activity signals from these two anatomically overlapping neuron groups, by simultaneously recording a green signal in PPM3-EB (GCaMP6s) and a red signal in EB-RNs (jGECO1a, Dana et al., 2016Dana H. Mohar B. Sun Y. Narayan S. Gordus A. Hasseman J.P. Tsegaye G. Holt G.T. Hu A. Walpita D. et al.Sensitive red protein calcium indicators for imaging neural activity.eLife. 2016; 5: e12727Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). We found that the spontaneous Ca2+ activity patterns of EB-RNs were highly correlated with those of PPM3-EB, but poorly correlated with those of the l-LNv circadian neurons, which were also labeled by jGECO1a (Figures 5C–5F and S6C). This result suggests that PPM3-EB and EB-RNs are closely connected; they receive common inputs, and/or one receives synapses from the other. Next, we turned to anatomical analysis using the GRASP method (GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners; Feinberg et al., 2008Feinberg E.H. Vanhoven M.K. Bendesky A. Wang G. Fetter R.D. Shen K. Bargmann C.I. GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners (GRASP) defines cell contacts and synapses in living nervous systems.Neuron. 2008; 57: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). We expressed two complementary GFP fragments in PPM3-EB and EB-RNs respectively to demonstrate membrane appositions (potential synaptic connections) that normally exist between these two groups of neurons (Figures S6A and S6B). Furthermore, we asked whether the morning and evening activity peaks in PPM3-EB are independently dictated by M cells and E cells, respectively, as we showed for the bimodal activity patterns in the EB-RNs. Again, we overexpressed SSG using pdf-GAL4 (PDF > SGG) to selectively advance the M-cell activity peak (as in Figures 4D–4G). In these flies, we found that only the morning peak of PPM3-EB was phase advanced, while the evening peak phase was unaffected (Figures 5G–5J). This result suggested that"

Here, we show that monkeys' amygdala derive object values from observation and use these values to simulate a partner monkey's decision process. While monkeys alternated making reward-based choices, amygdala encoded object-specific values learned from observation. Dynamic activities converted these values to representations of the recorded monkey's own choices. Surprisingly, the same activity patterns unfolded spontaneously before partner's choices in separate neurons, as if these simulated the partner's decision-making. These neurons encoded signatures of mutual-inhibitory decision computation, including value comparisons and value-to-choice conversions, resulting in accurate predictions of partner's choices. Population decoding identified differential contributions of amygdala subnuclei. Biophysical modeling of amygdala circuits showed that simulation emerge naturally from convergence between object-value and self-other neurons. By simulating decision computations during observation, these could allow primates to reconstruct their social partners' mental states."
https://openalex.org/W2939794350,"Cover crops have the potential to be agricultural nitrogen (N) regulators that reduce leaching through soils and then deliver N to subsequent cash crops. Yet, regulating N in this way has proven difficult because the few cover crop species that are well-studied excel at either reducing N leaching or increasing N supply to cash crops, but they fail to excel at both simultaneously. We hypothesized that mixed species cover crop stands might balance the N fixing and N scavenging capabilities of individual species. We tested six cover crop monocultures and four mixtures for their effects on N cycling in an organically managed maize-soybean-wheat feed grain rotation in Pennsylvania, USA. For three years, we used a suite of integrated approaches to quantify N dynamics, including extractable soil inorganic N, buried anion exchange resins, bucket lysimeters, and plant N uptake. All cover crop species, including legume monocultures, reduced N leaching compared to fallow plots. Cereal rye monocultures reduced N leaching to buried resins by 90% relative to fallow; notably, mixtures with just a low seeding rate of rye did almost as well. Austrian winter pea monocultures increased N uptake in maize silage by 40 kg N ha-1 relative to fallow, and conversely rye monocultures decreased N uptake into maize silage by 40 kg N ha-1 relative to fallow. Importantly, cover crop mixtures had larger impacts on leaching reduction than on maize N uptake, when compared to fallow plots. For example, a three-species mixture of pea, red clover, and rye had similar maize N uptake to fallow plots, but leaching rates were 80% lower in this mixture than fallow plots. Our results show clearly that cover crop species selection and mixture design can substantially mitigate tradeoffs between N retention and N supply to cash crops, providing a powerful tool for managing N in temperate cropping systems."
https://openalex.org/W2936163503,"Yeast ataxin-2, also known as Pbp1 (polyA binding protein-binding protein 1), is an intrinsically disordered protein implicated in stress granule formation, RNA biology, and neurodegenerative disease. To understand the endogenous function of this protein, we identify Pbp1 as a dedicated regulator of TORC1 signaling and autophagy under conditions that require mitochondrial respiration. Pbp1 binds to TORC1 specifically during respiratory growth, but utilizes an additional methionine-rich, low complexity (LC) region to inhibit TORC1. This LC region causes phase separation, forms reversible fibrils, and enables self-association into assemblies required for TORC1 inhibition. Mutants that weaken phase separation in vitro exhibit reduced capacity to inhibit TORC1 and induce autophagy. Loss of Pbp1 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced fitness during nutritional stress. Thus, Pbp1 forms a condensate in response to respiratory status to regulate TORC1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2908141125,"How do we remember emotional events? While emotion often leads to vivid recollection, the precision of emotional memories can be degraded, especially when discriminating among overlapping experiences in memory (i.e., pattern separation). Communication between the amygdala and the hippocampus has been proposed to support emotional memory, but the exact neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we used intracranial recordings in pre-surgical epilepsy patients to show that successful pattern separation of emotional stimuli is associated with theta band (3-7 Hz)-coordinated bidirectional interactions between the amygdala and the hippocampus. In contrast, discrimination errors (i.e., failure to discriminate similar stimuli) were associated with alpha band (7-13 Hz)-coordinated unidirectional influence from the amygdala to the hippocampus. These findings imply that alpha band synchrony may impair discrimination of similar emotional events via the amygdala-hippocampal directional coupling, which suggests a target for treatments of psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, in which aversive experiences are often overgeneralized."

The impact of this technique on examination timing parameters and MR protocols in a clinical setting was investigated in this retrospective study.A numerical analysis of the examination timing parameters (scan time, exam time, procedure time, interscan delay time, changeover time, nonscan time) based on the MR protocols of 6 different body regions (brain, knee, lumbar spine, breast, shoulder) using MR log files was performed and the total number of examinations acquired from January to April both in 2017 and 2018 on a 1.5 T MR scanner was registered. Percentages, box plots and unpaired two-sided t tests were obtained for statistical evaluation.All examination timing parameters of the six anatomical regions analysed were significantly shortened after implementation of Compressed SENSE. On average, scan times were accelerated by 20.2% (p<0.0001) while procedure times were shortened by 16% (p<0.0001). Considering all anatomical regions and all MR protocols, 27% more examinations were performed over the same 4 month period in 2018 compared to 2017.Compressed SENSE allows for a significant acceleration of MR examinations and a considerable increase in the total number of MR examinations is possible."
https://openalex.org/W2938525919,"Cell-autonomous Wnt signaling has well-characterized functions in controlling stem cell activity, including in the prostate. While niche cells secrete Wnt ligands, the effects of Wnt signaling in niche cells per se are less understood. Here, we show that stromal cells in the proximal prostatic duct near the urethra, a mouse prostate stem cell niche, not only produce multiple Wnt ligands but also exhibit strong Wnt/β-catenin activity. The non-canonical Wnt ligand Wnt5a, secreted by proximal stromal cells, directly inhibits proliefration of prostate epithelial stem or progenitor cells whereas stromal cell-autonomous canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling indirectly suppresses prostate stem or progenitor activity via the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway. Collectively, these pathways restrain the proliferative potential of epithelial cells in the proximal prostatic ducts. Human prostate likewise exhibits spatially restricted distribution of stromal Wnt/β-catenin activity, suggesting a conserved mechanism for tissue patterning. Thus, this study shows how distinct stromal signaling mechanisms within the prostate cooperate to regulate tissue homeostasis."

PFCs are marked by N-cadherin expression (NCAD+) and reside exclusively at the colony boundary of primate PSCs. As demonstrated by functional analysis, hPFCs harbor the clonogenic capacity of PSC cultures and emerge prior to commitment events or phenotypes associated with pluripotent reprogramming. Comparative single-cell analysis with pre- and post-implantation primate embryos revealed hPFCs share hallmark properties with primitive endoderm (PrE) and can be regulated by non-canonical Wnt signaling. Uniquely informed by primate embryo organization in vivo, our study defines a subset of founder cells critical to the establishment pluripotent state."
https://openalex.org/W2939926176,"How, and to what extent do size and shape of a voxel measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) affect the ability to visualize small brain nuclei? Despite general consensus that voxel geometry affects volumetric properties of regions of interest, particularly those of small brain nuclei, no quantitative data on the influence of voxel size and shape on labeling accuracy is available. Using simulations, we investigated the selective influence of voxel geometry by reconstructing simulated ellipsoid structures with voxels varying in shape and size. For each reconstructed ellipsoid, we calculated differences in volume and similarity between the labeled volume and the predefined dimensions of the ellipsoid. Probability functions were derived from one or two individual raters and a simulated ground truth for reference. As expected, larger voxels (i.e., coarser resolution) and increasing anisotropy results in increased deviations of both volume and shape measures, which is of particular relevance for small brain structures. Our findings clearly illustrate the anatomical inaccuracies introduced by the application of large and/or anisotropic voxels. To ensure deviations occur within the acceptable range (Dice coefficient scores; DCS > 0.75, corresponding to < 57% volume deviation), the volume of isotropic voxels should not exceed 5% of the total volume of the region of interest. When high accuracy is required (DCS > 0.90, corresponding to a < 19% volume deviation), the volumes of isotropic voxels should not exceed 0.08%, of the total volume. Finally, when large anisotropic factors (>3) are used, and the ellipsoid is orthogonal to the slice axes, having its long axis in the imaging plane, the voxel volume should not exceed 0.005% of the total volume. This allows sufficient compensation of anisotropy effects, in order to reach accuracy in the acceptable range (DCS > 0.75, corresponding to >57% volume deviation)."

Effects of NAFLD on pregnancy is still unclear with few studies showing an association to gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. We aimed to describe the association between the NAFLD and pregnancy complications. This is the first study, to our knowledge, in a South Asian population.A cross sectional analytical study was done in Teaching Hospital, Ragama, Sri Lanka. Women carrying a singleton pregnancy, admitted for delivery were assessed for NAFLD with liver ultrasound scan. Data were extracted from interviewer administered questionnaire and antenatal and inpatient records. Pregnancy complications and labour outcomes were compared between the women with NAFLD and women without NAFLD (non-NAFLD).Out of the 573 women who participated, 18.2% (n = 104) were found to have NAFLD. Out of them, 58 (55.8%), 32(30.8%), and 14(13.5%) had fatty liver grade 1,2 and 3 respectively. Women with NAFLD were 2 times more likely to develop gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia compared to the women in the non-NAFLD group, after adjusting for BMI, age and Hyperglycaemia in pregnancy [Adjusted OR 2.09, (95% CI 1.07-4.10)]. There was no association between the grade of steatosis and a composite outcome of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, within the NAFLD group. Composite outcome of gestational diabetes mellitus and diabetes in pregnancy diagnosed during pregnancy was a significant complication in the NAFLD group compared to non-NAFLD group in the bivariate analysis (27.2% vs 17.7%; p<0.05), but the significance disappeared after adjusting for confounders. The current study did not demonstrate a significant association between NAFLD with preterm labour, caesarean section rate, low birth weight, and Apgar score of the baby.Women with NAFLD had a 2-fold higher risk of developing gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy compared to women without NAFLD, after controlling for other confounding variables."
https://openalex.org/W2939963599,"In cyanobacterial photoprotection, the orange carotenoid protein (OCP) is photoactivated under excess light conditions and binds to the light-harvesting antenna, triggering the dissipation of captured light energy. In low light, the OCP relaxes to the native state, a process that is accelerated in the presence of fluorescence recovery protein (FRP). Despite the importance of the OCP in photoprotection, the precise mechanism of photoactivation by this protein is not well-understood. Using time-resolved X-ray-mediated in situ hydroxyl radical labeling, we probed real-time solvent accessibility (SA) changes at key OCP residues during photoactivation and relaxation. We observed a biphasic photoactivation process in which carotenoid migration preceded domain dissociation. We also observed a multiphasic relaxation process, with collapsed domain association preceding the final conformational rearrangement of the carotenoid. Using steady-state hydroxyl radical labeling, we identified sites of interaction between the FRP and OCP. In combination, the findings in this study provide molecular-level insights into the factors driving structural changes during OCP-mediated photoprotection in cyanobacteria, and furnish a basis for understanding the physiological relevance of the FRP-mediated relaxation process."

The purpose of this retrospective study is to demonstrate feasibility of the implementation of an upper limb myoelectric orthosis for the treatment of persistent moderate upper limb impairment following stroke (>6 months). Methods: Nine patients (>6 months post stroke) participated in treatment at an outpatient Occupational Therapy department utilizing the MyoPro myoelectric orthotic device. Group therapy was provided at a frequency of 1–2 sessions per week (60–90 minutes per session). Patients were instructed to perform training with the device at home on non-therapy days and to continue with use of the device after completion of the group training period. Outcome measures included Fugl-Meyer Upper Limb Assessment (FM) and modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Results: Patients demonstrated clinically important and statistically significant improvement of 9.0±4.8 points (p = 0.0005) on a measure of motor control impairment (FM) during participation in group training. It was feasible to administer the training in a group setting with the MyoPro, using a 1:4 ratio (therapist to patients). Muscle tone improved for muscles with MAS >1.5 at baseline. Discussion: Myoelectric orthosis use is feasible in a group clinic setting and in home-use structure for chronic stroke survivors. Clinically important motor control gains were observed on FM in 7 of 9 patients who participated in training."

Such collaborations are increasingly facilitated by, and dependent upon, sharing open access data from a variety of disciplinary communities and data sources, including those within biology, paleontology, and archaeology. Significant advances in biodiversity open data sharing have focused on neontological and paleontological specimen records, making available over a billion records through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. But to date, less effort has been placed on the integration of important archaeological sources of biodiversity, such as zooarchaeological specimens. Zooarchaeological specimens are rich with both biological and cultural heritage data documenting nearly all phases of human interaction with animals and the surrounding environment through time, filling a critical gap between paleontological and neontological sources of data within biodiversity networks. Here we describe technical advances for mobilizing zooarchaeological specimen-specific biological and cultural data. In particular, we demonstrate adaptations in the workflow used by biodiversity publisher VertNet to mobilize Darwin Core formatted zooarchaeological data to the GBIF network. We also show how a linked open data approach can be used to connect existing biodiversity publishing mechanisms with archaeoinformatics publishing mechanisms through collaboration with the Open Context platform. Examples of ZooArchNet published datasets are used to show the efficacy of creating this critically needed bridge between biological and archaeological sources of open access data. These technical advances and efforts to support data publication are placed in the larger context of ZooarchNet, a new project meant to build community around new approaches to interconnect zoorchaeological data and knowledge across disciplines."

Questing Ixodes ricinus nymph samples were taken at six localities within Ireland. DNA extraction followed by Sanger sequencing was used to identify the species and strains present in each tick. The overall rate of borrelial infection in the Irish tick population was 5%, with a range from 2% to 12% depending on the locations of tick collection. The most prevalent species detected was B. garinii (70%) followed by B. valaisiana (20%) and B. miyamotoi (10%). Knowledge of Borrelia species prevalence is important and will guide appropriate selection of antigens for serology test kit manufacture, help define the risk of infection, and allow medical authorities to formulate appropriate strategies and guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of Borrelia diseases."

The only currently approved drug treatment shown to reduce the risk of DCI and improve neurologic outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is nimodipine, a dihydropyridine L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blocker. MEK1/2 mediated transcriptional upregulation of contractile receptors, including endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptors, has previously been shown to be a factor in the pathology of SAH. The aim of the study was to compare intrathecal and subcutaneous treatment regimens of nimodipine and intrathecal treatment regimens of U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, in a single injection experimental rat SAH model with post 48 h endpoints consisting of wire myography of cerebral arteries, flow cytometry of cerebral arterial tissue and behavioural evaluation. Following ET-1 concentration-response curves, U0126 exposed arteries had a significantly lower ET-1max than vehicle arteries. Arteries from both the intrathecal- and subcutaneous nimodipine treated animals had significantly higher ET-1max contractions than the U0126 arteries. Furthermore, Ca2+ concentration response curves (precontracted with ET-1 and in the presence of nimodipine) showed that nimodipine treatment could result in larger nimodipine insensitive contractions compared to U0126. Flow cytometry showed decreased protein expression of the ETB receptor in U0126 treated cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells compared to vehicle. Only U0126 treatment lowered ET-1max contractions and ETB receptor levels, as well as decreased the contractions involving nimodipine-insensitive Ca2+ channels, when compared to both intrathecal and subcutaneous nimodipine treatment. This indicate that targeting gene expression might be a better strategy than blocking specific receptors or ion channels in future treatments of SAH."

Exploring this under-researched area provided an opportunity to understand the tripartite relationship between the family, the youth experiencing mental health problems or substance use concerns and their HCP. Methods A qualitative research design was used to gain a full understanding of how family members experience relationships with HCPs. We interviewed 21 family members using semi-structure questions to explore the type of relationships formed between HCPs and family members throughout a patient’s course of care, the family member’s perceived role in the care of their youth accessing mental health or addiction services and the family member’s awareness of formalized structures (i.e., hospital rules, policies) and resources that support family involvement. Results Within a relationship-centred framework, four themes, with various sub-themes emerged from the interviews: 1) The family member–HCP relationship regarding creating a positive impression, being an extension of the patient and the discovery of “pink flags”; 2) The family member–youth–HCP relationship regarding the receptivity of youth to family involvement and a youth’s individual right to privacy; 3)The family member’s relationship to self with regard to the situation being a family illness; and 4) The family member’s relationship with friends, family and peers regarding the feelings of loneliness, stigma and shame and the lack of understanding about mental health problems and substance use. Conclusions Our study provided in-depth information about the importance of family involvement in the care and health outcomes of youth who are accessing mental health and addiction services. Family members experienced and conceptualized their relationships with HCPs, their youth, themselves and their friends and peers as active interactions that influenced the course and outcomes of care.

We have previously found that a pore-forming peptide LaFr26, purified from the venom of the Lachesana sp spider, was selectively incorporated into K+ channel expressing hyperpolarized cells. Therefore, it is expected that this peptide would have selective cytotoxicity to hyperpolarized cancer cells. Here we have tested whether LaFr26 and its related peptide, oxyopinin-2b, are selectively cytotoxic to K+ channel expressing cancer cells. These peptides were cytotoxic to the cells, of which resting membrane potential was hyperpolarized. The vulnerabilities of K+ channel-expressing cell lines correlated with their resting membrane potential. They were cytotoxic to lung cancer cell lines LX22 and BEN, which endogenously expressed K+ current. Contrastingly, these peptides were ineffective to glioblastoma cell lines, U87 and T98G, of which membrane potentials were depolarized. Peptides have a drawback, i.e. poor drug-delivery, that hinders their potential use as medicine. To overcome this drawback, we prepared lentiviral vectors that can express these pore-forming peptides and tested the cytotoxicity to K+ channel expressing cells. The transduction with these lentiviral vectors showed autotoxic activity to the channel expressing cells. Our study provides the basis for a new oncolytic viral therapy."

This study was undertaken to gain scientific evidences for a molecular correlation between constipation and AD. Methods To understand the etiology, we measured alterations in various constipation parameters, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, in 11-month-old Tg2576 transgenic (Tg) mice showing AD-like phenotypes. Results A high accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, a key marker of AD pathology, were detected in the cortex and hippocampus of Tg mice. Furthermore, significant alterations were observed in various constipation parameters including stool weight, histological structure, cytological structure and mucin secretion in Tg2576 mice. Moreover, M2 and M3 expression and the downstream signaling pathways of mAChRs were decreased in the Tg group, as compared with non-Tg (NT) group. Furthermore, activation of ER stress proteins and alteration of ER structure were also detected in the same group.

However, competition for acquiring N as well as specific interactions between blueberry and companion weeds characterized by contrasted functional traits remain poorly documented. Here, we assessed fertilizer-derived N acquisition efficiency and biomass production in lowbush blueberry and two common weed species that have different functional traits—sweet fern (Comptonia peregrina), a N2-fixing shrub, and poverty oat grass (Danthonia spicata), a perennial grass—in a commercial blueberry field in Québec, Canada. In 2015, 15N-labelled ammonium sulfate was applied at a rate of 45 kg ha-1 to 1 m2 field plots containing lowbush blueberry and one of the two weeds present at several different density levels (0 to 25 plants m-2). In 2016, each plot was harvested to determine vegetative biomass and the percentage of fertilizer-derived N recovered (PFNR) in each species. The PFNR was higher in blueberry (24.4 ± 9.3%) than in sweet fern (13.4 ± 2.6%) and poverty oat grass (3.3 ± 2.9%). However, lowbush blueberry required about four times more root biomass than sweet fern and poverty oat grass to uptake an equivalent amount of N from ammonium sulfate. The PFNR in poverty oat grass increased with plant density (from 0.8% to 6.4% at 2–3 and >6 plants m-2, respectively), which resulted in a decrease in blueberry’s PFNR (from 26.0 ± 1.4% to 8.6 ± 1.8%) and aboveground vegetative biomass production (from 152 ± 58 to 80 ± 28 g m-2). The increase in biomass production and N content in sweet fern with increasing plant density was not accompanied by an increase in PFNR (29.7 ± 8.4%), suggesting an increasing contribution of atmospherically-derived N. This mechanism (i.e., N sparing) likely explained blueberry’s higher biomass production and N concentration in association with sweet fern than with poverty oat grass. Overall, our study confirms lowbush blueberry low efficiency (on a mass basis) at taking up N derived from the fertilizer as compared to weeds and reveals contrasted and complex interactions between blueberry and both weed species. Our results also suggest that the use of herbicides may not be necessary when poverty oat grass is present at a low density (<15 plants of poverty oat grass m-2) and that adding inorganic N fertilizer is counterproductive when this species is present at a high density as it takes up as much fertilizer as lowbush blueberry."
https://openalex.org/W2936225140,"After an earthquake, the important task of emergency rescue work is to minimize casualties, but due to the suddenness of earthquake disasters, it is difficult to obtain enough disaster information immediately, especially personnel distribution and movement information. The traditional methods of obtaining disaster data are through reports from the disaster area or field investigations by the emergency rescue team; this work lags, and its efficiency is low. This paper analyzes the feasibility of using mobile phone location signal data in earthquake emergency rescue work in several respects, such as quantity, location, change rate, and epicentral distance. The results show that mobile phone location signal data can quickly obtain the situation of personnel distribution and quantity after an earthquake, and we find the change rate, distance, etc., can determine the approximate range of the earthquake impact field. Through the data distribution in different time periods, the movement of personnel after the earthquake can be obtained. Based on several situations, we can determine the basic situation of the disaster-stricken areas in times after the earthquake, especially the personnel relevant to the situation, and these data can provide a scientific basis for emergency rescue decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2937380821,"Although the blockade of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand (L) 1 has demonstrated promising and durable clinical responses for non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), NSCLC patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations responded poorly to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Previous studies have identified several predictive biomarkers, including the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapies in NSCLC patients; however, the usefulness of these biomarkers in NSCLCs with EGFR mutations has not been elucidated. The present study was conducted to evaluate the predictive biomarkers for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs. We retrospectively analyzed 9 patients treated with nivolumab for EGFR-mutated NSCLCs. All but one patient received EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors before nivolumab treatment. The overall response rate and median progression-free survival were 11% and 33 days (95% confidence interval (CI); 7 to 51), respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that patients with a good performance status (P = 0.11; hazard ratio (HR) 0.183, 95% CI 0.0217 to 1.549), a high density of CD4+ T cells (P = 0.136; HR 0.313, 95% CI 0.045 to 1.417) and a high density of Foxp3+ cells (P = 0.09; HR 0.264, 95% CI 0.0372 to 1.222) in the tumor microenvironment tended to have longer progression-free survival with nivolumab. Multivariate analysis revealed that a high density of CD4+ T cells (P = 0.005; HR<0.001, 95% CI <0.001 to 0.28) and a high density of Foxp3+ cells (P = 0.003; HR<0.001, 95% CI NA) in tumor tissues were strongly correlated with better progression-free survival. In contrast to previous studies in wild type EGFR NSCLCs, PD-L1 expression was not associated with the clinical benefit of anti-PD-1 treatment in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs. The current study indicated that immune status in the tumor microenvironment may be important for the effectiveness of nivolumab in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2938149915,"An extreme learning machine (ELM) is a novel training method for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) in which the hidden nodes are randomly assigned and fixed without iterative tuning. ELMs have earned widespread global interest due to their fast learning speed, satisfactory generalization ability and ease of implementation. In this paper, we extend this theory to hypercomplex space and attempt to simultaneously consider multisource information using a hypercomplex representation. To illustrate the performance of the proposed hypercomplex extreme learning machine (HELM), we have applied this scheme to the task of multispectral palmprint recognition. Images from different spectral bands are utilized to construct the hypercomplex space. Extensive experiments conducted on the PolyU and CASIA multispectral databases demonstrate that the HELM scheme can achieve competitive results.

Venous to Arterial Conversion (v-TAC; OBIMedical ApS, Denmark) is a method to calculate ABG values from a VBG and pulse oximetry (SpO2). The aim was to validate v-TAC against ABG for measuring pH, carbon dioxide (pCO2) and oxygenation (pO2).Of 103 sample sets, 87 paired ABGs and VBGs with SpO2 from 46 inpatients eligible for ABG met strict sampling criteria. Agreement was evaluated using mean difference with 95% limits of agreement (LoA) and Bland-Altman plots.v-TAC had very high agreement with ABG for pH (mean diff(ABG-v-TAC) -0.001; 95% LoA -0.017 to 0.016), pCO2 (-0.14 kPa; 95% LoA -0.46 to 0.19) and moderate to high for pO2 (-0.28 kPa; 95% LoA -1.31 to 0.76). For detecting hypercapnia (PaCO2>6.0 kPa), v-TAC had sensitivity 100%, specificity 93.8% and accuracy 97%. The accuracy of v-TAC for detecting hypoxemia (PaO2<8.0 kPa) was comparable to that of pulse oximetry. Agreement with ABG was higher for v-TAC than for VBG for all analyses.Calculated arterial blood gases (v-TAC) from a venous sample and pulse oximetry were comparable to ABG values and may be useful for evaluation of blood gases in clinical settings. This could reduce the logistic burden of arterial sampling, facilitate improved screening and follow-up and reduce patient pain."
https://openalex.org/W2940156362,"Vision is very important to fish as it is required for foraging food, fighting competitors, fleeing from predators, and finding potential mates. Vertebrates express opsin genes in photoreceptor cells to receive visual signals, and the variety of light levels in aquatic habits has driven fish to evolve multiple opsin genes with expression profiles that are highly plastic. In this study, red shiners (Cyprinella lutrensis) were exposed to four water turbidity treatments and their opsin genes were cloned to elucidate how opsin gene expression could be modulated by ambient light conditions. Opsin gene cloning revealed that these fish have single RH1, SWS1, SWS2 and LWS genes and two RH2 genes. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated that these two RH2 opsin genes–RH2A and RH2B –are in-paralogous. Using quantitative PCR, we found evidence that opsin expression is plastic in adults. Elevated proportional expression of LWS in the cone under ambient light and turbid treatment indicated that the red shiner’s visual spectrum displays a red shift in response to increased turbidity."

With cultural beliefs influencing care seeking behaviour and disparities existing in health infrastructure across the country, an understanding of the underlying issues merits exploration. Study assessed prevalence of probable pneumonia and examined care seeking behaviour of mothers in three states, Madhya Pradesh (MP), Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Tamil Nadu (TN). This mixed methods study involved a household survey and qualitative interviews with mothers in three districts from each state. Households with children aged 2-59 months were screened to identify those with probable pneumonia; sub-sample of mothers participated in qualitative interviews. Care seeking behaviour was explored in the context of recognition of symptoms, nature of first care provided, time when care was sought outside the home and choice of health provider. Overall 17,442 children from 13,544 households were screened, of which 729 (MP), 752 (UP) and 713 (TN) children respectively, were identified with probable pneumonia; 72 mothers participated in the qualitative interviews. Three months period prevalence was estimated in study districts at 22.2%-MP 13.3%-UP and 8.4%-TN. Most mothers in MP and UP were not perceptive to severity of illness; type of care sought was often inappropriate, delayed, with home remedies and visits to unqualified care providers being their first response. In contrast, in TN, use of home remedies was minimal, going to untrained care providers, non-existent and more than 90% mothers sought appropriate care. Private doctors were the preferred choice among all mothers but utilization of government care was highest in TN (20%). Community health workers were underutilized, with less than 10% mothers consulting them. Need for educating mothers about appropriate care seeking and development of good health infrastructure as essential to attainment of better child health indices are advocated."
https://openalex.org/W2936037051,"Background Molecular size determination of circulating free fetal DNA in maternal plasma is an important detection method for noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT). The fetal DNA molecule is the primary factor determining the overall performance of NIPT and its clinical interpretation. The proportion of cell-free fetal DNA molecules is expressed as the fetal DNA fraction in the plasma of pregnant women. Methods We proposed an effective method to deduce fetal chromosomal aneuploidy based on the proportion of a certain range of DNA fragment lengths from maternal plasma. We gradually narrowed the range of the upper and lower boundary via a traversing algorithm. Results We explored the optimal range of the upper and lower boundary by using size-based DNA fragment length. Using this range, the accuracy of the sensitivity and specificity could be improved by up to 100% for detecting the three most common autosomal aneuploidies, namely trisomy 13, trisomy 18, trisomy 21 in the sample set.

However, compounds and mechanisms that specifically inhibit LYP enzymes to address therapeutic needs to manage these diseases remain to be discovered. Here, we conducted a similarity search of a commercial database for PTPN22 inhibitors and identified several LYP inhibitor scaffolds, which helped identify one highly active inhibitor, NC1. Using noncompetitive inhibition curve and phosphatase assays, we determined NC1’s inhibition mode toward PTPN22 and its selectivity toward a panel of phosphatases. We found that NC1 is a noncompetitive LYP inhibitor and observed that it exhibits selectivity against other protein phosphatases and effectively inhibits LYP activity in lymphoid T cells and modulates T-cell receptor signaling. Results from site-directed mutagenesis, fragment-centric topographic mapping, and molecular dynamics simulation experiments suggested that NC1, unlike other known LYP inhibitors, concurrently binds to a “WPD” pocket and a second pocket surrounded by an LYP-specific insert, which contributes to its selectivity against other phosphatases. Moreover, using a newly developed method to incorporate the unnatural amino acid 2-fluorine-tyrosine and 19F NMR spectroscopy, we provide direct evidence that NC1 allosterically regulates LYP activity by restricting WPD-loop movement. In conclusion, our approach has identified a new allosteric binding site in LYP useful for selective LYP inhibitor development; we propose that the 19F NMR probe developed here may also be useful for characterizing allosteric inhibitors of other tyrosine phosphatases.

https://openalex.org/W2939625529,"The groundwater level is the main factor affecting the distribution of soil salinity and vegetation in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China, but the response relationship between the spatial distribution of soil salt ions and the groundwater level in the soil-Tamarix chinensis system remains unclear. In order to investigate the patterns of soil salt ions responding to groundwater levels, in the ‘groundwater-soil-T. chinensis’ system. Soil columns planted with T. chinensis, a constructive species in the YRD, were taken as the study object, and six groundwater levels (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5 and 1.8 m) were simulated under saline mineralization. The results demonstrated the following: As affected by groundwater, Na+ and Cl- were the main ions in the T. chinensis-planted soil column, with a trend of decreasing first and then increasing by the increase of soil depth. However, the contents of K+ and NO3- gradually decreased and CO32-+HCO3- gradually increased. As affected by groundwater evaporation, all the salt ions except CO32-+HCO3- exhibited different degrees of surface aggregation in the 0–20 cm layer. However, due to the impact of root uptake, the contents of the salt ions rapidly decreased in the root distribution layer (20–50 cm soil layer), which rendered a turning-point layer that was significantly lower than the surface soil layer; such decreases in ion contents showed a relatively large rate of variation. In the whole T. chinensis-planted soil column, with increasing groundwater level, the contents of Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, and NO3- all tended to first decrease, then increase and decrease again, but the content of CO32-+HCO3- first decreased and then increased. Therefore, the 0.9 m groundwater level was the turning point at which the main salt ions underwent significant changes. The contents of Na+, Cl-, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the T. chinensis planted soil column exhibited moderate variability (14.46%<CV<86.46%), with a relatively large degree of variability across the 20–50 cm root-concentrated distribution layer and the surface soil layer. However, the K+ content exhibited greater variability (CV>111.36%) at most groundwater level except less than 0.9 m. Therefore, planting T. chinensis could effectively reduce the accumulation of salt ions in the 20–50 cm soil layer with a concentrated root distribution, suggesting that the planting depth of T. chinensis should be greater than 20 cm under saline mineralization. This study can provide references for the control of soil secondary salinization and the management of T. chinensis seedling cultivation under saline mineralization."

Here, we show that ICA512 RESP18HD residues 91–131 encode for an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which in vitro acts as a condensing factor for the reversible aggregation of insulin and other β-cell proteins in a pH and Zn2+-regulated fashion. At variance with what has been shown for other granule cargoes with aggregating properties, the condensing activity of ICA512 RESP18HD is displayed at a pH close to neutral, i.e. in the pH range found in the early secretory pathway, whereas it is resolved at acidic pH and Zn2+ concentrations resembling those present in mature SGs. Moreover, we show that ICA512 RESP18HD residues 35–90, preceding the IDR, inhibit insulin fibrillation in vitro. Finally, we found that glucose-stimulated secretion of RESP18HD upon exocytosis of SGs from insulinoma INS-1 cells is associated with cleavage of its IDR, conceivably to prevent its aggregation upon exposure to neutral pH in the extracellular milieu. Taken together, these findings point to ICA512 RESP18HD being a condensing factor for protein sorting and granulogenesis early in the secretory pathway and for prevention of amyloidogenesis.

ICA512 NTF, the other luminal segment resulting from the proprotein convertase processing of ICA512, is much less characterized. The ICA512 NTF region encompassing residues 35–131, immediately after the signal peptide, exhibits sequence similarity to the regulated endocrine-specific protein 18 (Resp18; Fig. 1). As ICA512 and phogrin, Resp18 is widely expressed in peptide hormone–secreting endocrine cells, including α-, β-, and δ-cells of the pancreatic islets, and its expression is up-regulated in conditions stimulating SG biogenesis (23Zhang G. Hirai H. Cai T. Miura J. Yu P. Huang H. Schiller M.R. Swaim W.D. Leapman R.D. Notkins A.L.

In view of its similarity to Resp18, the segment corresponding to residues 35–131 of ICA512 was named Resp18 homology domain (RESP18HD) (24Sosa L. Torkko J.M. Primo M.E. Llovera R.E. Toledo P.L.

Interestingly, ICA512 RESP18HD has a conserved cysteine-rich N-terminal region (residues 35–62), which is absent in Resp18 (Fig. 1B). In previous studies, we showed that ICA512 RESP18HD contains sufficient information to direct green fluorescent protein (GFP) to insulin SGs, whereas deletion of the entire ICA512 NTF, which includes ICA512 RESP18HD, causes the constitutive delivery of ICA512 to the plasma membrane, hence abolishing SG targeting (20Torkko J.M.

Congregation–aggregation processes are of two main classes: liquid–liquid phase transitions (LLPT) and liquid–solid phase separation or, for short, aggregation. LLPT and aggregation have in common a stage of segregation in which the participant molecules congregate guided by multiple noncovalent interactions. However, the outcomes of these two processes are different, being either separated liquid-like or solid-like phases. These two kinds of phases establish a dynamic exchange with a main liquid phase in which macromolecules form a nonhomogeneous solution. Liquid-like phases have surface and bulk properties typical of liquids and acquire droplet morphology (29Wheeler R.J. Hyman A.A. Controlling compartmentalization by non-membrane-bound organelles.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. B Biol. Sci. 2018; 3732017019310.1098/rstb.2017.0193Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Typical examples are the nucleolus, Cajal bodies, nuclear speckles, stress granules, P-bodies, and germ granules (30Shin Y. Brangwynne C.P.

Solid-like phases result from protein aggregation that causes microscopic solid deposition. The morphology of solid deposits is exuberant. Crystal-like deposits are formed in endocrine and exocrine SGs (26Dannies P.S.

In contrast, typical amorphous aggregates in the eye lens cause cataracts, a widespread disease of aging. Protein congregation involves heterotropic and nonstoichiometric protein–protein interactions, and it is characterized by its collective and cooperative nature. Also, it implies robust recognition mechanisms, acting simultaneously upon very different proteins. In this regard, it is revealing that proteins prone to congregation are frequently rich in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and low complexity regions, as if well-folded proteins were less susceptible to it. Partially unfolded protein conformations are ideal candidates for the promotion of collective congregation because they expose a higher proportion of active areas compared with native states, thus facilitating intermolecular over intramolecular interactions. Given that cross-reactivity is an essential aspect of protein congregation, the identification and characterization of proteins that participate in congregations, and particularly of those that may display a congregating activity, promise to be of singular importance to boost our understanding of cellular processes, both in normal and pathological conditions. In this present study, we investigate in greater detail the biochemical and biophysical properties of ICA512 RESP18HD in relation to its congregating activity. The auto-aggregating activity of ICA512 RESP18HD, demonstrated by light-scattering measurements (Fig. 2A), was negligible at pH 4.5, very slow at pH 6.8, and increased abruptly above pH 7.0. This pH dependence suggested that ICA512 RESP18HD histidine residues (His-38, His-49, and/or His-98) might be involved in the aggregation. Therefore, we tested possible histidine ligands. Micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ abolished aggregation, and the effect was reversible by equimolar EDTA (Fig. 2B). Neither Ca2+ nor Mg2+ acted like Zn2+; however, Cu2+ mimicked Zn2+ but with lower efficiency (Fig. S1A). Complete inhibition of ICA512 RESP18HD self-aggregation was observed at pH 7.4 and 15 μm Zn2+ (Fig. S1B). To roughly estimate ICA512 RESP18HD affinity for Zn2+, the aggregation kinetics was modeled as a first-order reaction, and an exponential decay was fit to the calculated rate constants (Fig. S1C). This simplified treatment allowed Zn2+ IC50 to be estimated as 2 μm. Direct equilibrium measurements of Zn2+ binding at pH 7.4 were complicated by aggregation. However, aggregation was minimal at pH 4.5, and microfiltration through 3-kDa membranes could be performed (data not shown), and by using the law of mass action, a dissociation constant of 1 μm was calculated. This result suggests that ICA512 RESP18HD binds Zn2+ even in the acidic conditions of pH 5.5 present in the lumen of newly generated SGs (35Neukam M. Soenmez A. Solimena M. FLIM-based pH measurements reveal incretin-induced rejuvenation of aged insulin secretory granules.bioRxiv. 2017; 10.1101/174391Google Scholar), in which the concentration of Zn2+ is ≈20 mm (36Foster M.C. Leapman R.D. Li M.X. Atwater I. Elemental composition of secretory granules in pancreatic islets of Langerhans.Biophys. J. 1993; 64 (8457676): 525-53210.1016/S0006-3495(93)81397-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Far-UV CD spectra of ICA512 RESP18HD are shown in Fig. S1D. The spectrum at pH 4.5 corresponded to that of a largely unstructured peptide, and addition of 50 μm Zn2+ did not change it significantly. Both of these conditions inhibited the aggregation of ICA512 RESP18HD. Instead, at pH 7.4 and in the presence of 50 μm Zn2+, a condition that also inhibits ICA512 RESP18HD aggregation, the CD spectrum evidenced two negative bands at 205 and 218 nm and one positive band at 190 nm suggestive of α-helix formation. At pH 7.4 and in the absence of 50 μm Zn2+, the spectrum taken at the onset of aggregation evidenced the same secondary structure signature. Based on these results, we hypothesize that fully unfolded ICA512 RESP18HD has little tendency to aggregate and that partial folding is required to achieve an aggregation-prone state. To better delineate the ICA512 RESP18HD residues involved in the aggregation reaction, the variant 35–90 (RESP18HD90) was prepared. This variant contains the N-terminal Cys-rich motif (residues 35–61) but lacks the IDR encompassing residues 91–131 (see below). ICA512 RESP18HD90 did not aggregate under any of the conditions tested above (data not shown). Unless otherwise indicated, the results reported in this section are from experiments conducted in incubation media containing 2 μm ICA512 RESP18HD and 8 μm insulin. At pH 6.8, neither insulin nor ICA512 RESP18HD formed higher-order aggregates in isolation. However, when incubated together, ICA512 RESP18HD and insulin formed aggregates, readily detectable by light scattering (Fig. 2C). ICA512 RESP18HD90 did not aggregate with insulin (data not shown) and neither ICA512 RESP18HD nor insulin aggregated at pH 4.5 (Fig. 2D). Zn2+ inhibited the self-aggregation of ICA512 RESP18HD at pH 7.4 (Fig. 2B), but it did not inhibit the coaggregation of insulin and ICA512 RESP18HD at pH 6.8 (Fig. 2E). Thus, the aggregation of ICA512 RESP18HD with insulin is not a consequence of previous aggregation of ICA512 RESP18HD. Because Ca2+ is present at high concentrations in the SGs, its effects in the aggregation reactions was also investigated. Ca2+ did not inhibit the self-aggregation of ICA512 RESP18HD at pH 7.4 (Fig. S1A) or the coaggregation of insulin and ICA512 RESP18HD at pH 6.8 (Fig. 2E). To investigate whether the observed aggregation of ICA512 RESP18HD with insulin at pH 6.8 could result from ICA512 RESP18HD removal of Zn2+ from insulin, it was verified that EDTA did not induce insulin aggregation (Fig. 2C). Aggregates formed by coincubation of ICA512 RESP18HD and insulin at pH 6.8 dissolved at pH 4.0 (Fig. 2F). Moreover, aggregation was not influenced by reducing agents like DTT, phosphine, or mercaptoethanol (data not shown), suggesting that thiol–disulfide exchange reactions were not involved in the process. ICA512 RESP18HD–insulin aggregation at pH 6.8 was completely blocked by preincubation with 100 mm l-arginine (data not shown). l-Arginine is an unspecific anti-aggregating agent employed in protein folding protocols (37Tsumoto K. Umetsu M. Kumagai I. Ejima D. Philo J.S. Arakawa T. Role of arginine in protein refolding, solubilization, and purification.Biotechnol. Prog. 2004; 20 (15458311): 1301-130810.1021/bp0498793Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). l-Arginine added when aggregation was in progress prevented further aggregation, but already formed aggregates did not dissolve. ICA512 RESP18HD was also assayed for aggregation at pH 6.8 in the presence of proinsulin (His6) and amylin. Proinsulin behaved similarly to insulin (data not shown). Amylin was negative in the reaction with ICA512 RESP18HD but acted as a potent inhibitor in the aggregation of the pair ICA512 RESP18HD–insulin (Fig. 2G). This activity of amylin suggests that it interacts with either ICA512 RESP18HD, insulin, or with their complex blocking aggregation. Interestingly, an insulin anti-aggregating activity of amylin has been reported before (38Susa A.C. Wu C. Bernstein S.L. Dupuis N.F. Wang H. Raleigh D.P. Shea J.-E. Bowers M.T.

Different scoring systems for CINV were applied and different antiemetic drugs were used; however, few studies have been performed in children undergoing chemotherapy with Aprepitant. Herein, we report a pediatric experience on efficacy and safety of Aprepitant as part of triple antiemetic prophylaxis, in a cohort of thirty-two children and adolescents with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL), treated with moderate/highly emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC/HEC) regimens in a single Hemato-Oncology Institution. The triple therapy was compared to standard antiemetic therapy in a cohort of twenty-three HL patients (control group). Aprepitant therapy was associated to a significant decrease of chemotherapy-induced vomiting (p = 0.0001), while no impact on the reduction of nausea was observed; these observations were also confirmed by multivariate analysis (p = 0.0040). Aprepitant was well tolerated and the most commonly reported adverse events were neutropenia and hypertransaminasemia. No significant differences on the toxicity were observed between the two compared groups. Our experience on Aprepitant efficacy and safety, associated with feasibility of orally administration, suggests a possible widespread use of the drug to prevent pediatric CINV."

We also observed that genetic deletion of Sema3d leads to parathyroid hyperplasia, causing PHPT.

We further demonstrate that EGFR signaling is elevated in Sema3d−/− parathyroid glands and that pharmacological inhibition of EGFR signaling can partially rescue the parathyroid hyperplasia phenotype.

However, once the domains are specified within the same primordium, parathyroid cells express specific transcription factors such as glial cells missing 2 (Gcm2) (8Gordon J. Bennett A.R.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder caused by excessive secretion of PTH from the parathyroid glands (16Walker M.D. Silverberg S.J. Primary hyperparathyroidism.Nat. Rev.

PHPT is the third most common endocrine disorder, with a prevalence of 0.1–1.0%. It is more common in elderly females, with a prevalence of up to 2.1% in postmenopausal women (16Walker M.D. Silverberg S.J. Primary hyperparathyroidism.Nat. Rev.

In most cases of nonfamilial origin PHPT, hyperparathyroidism results from either benign single adenoma (80–85% cases) or multiglandular parathyroid hyperplasia (15–20% cases) (16Walker M.D. Silverberg S.J.

PHPT is characterized by increased parathyroid cell proliferation and calcium-insensitive hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone (20Bilezikian J.P. Cusano N.E. Khan A.A. Liu J.M. Marcocci C. Bandeira F. Primary hyperparathyroidism.Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2016; 2 (27194212)1603310.1038/nrdp.2016.33Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Another form of hyperparathyroidism is secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), in which parathyroid glands become enlarged and hyperactive in response to a condition outside of the parathyroid causing hypocalcemia. SHPT is most frequently seen in patients with chronic kidney disease (21Torres P.U. Prié D. Beck L. Friedlander G. New therapies for uremic secondary hyperparathyroidism.J. Ren.

In most primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism cases, increased serum PTH levels are associated with increased serum calcium levels, causing complications such as renal stones, neuropsychiatric disorders, and bone abnormalities (16Walker M.D. Silverberg S.J. Primary hyperparathyroidism.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2018; 14 (28885621): 115-12510.1038/nrendo.2017.104Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Parathyroidectomy is the most common treatment for hyperparathyroidism. However, reoperative treatment for persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism remains technically challenging due to fibrotic scar and distorted anatomy that make it more difficult to identify the abnormal parathyroid glands (17Bilezikian J.P. Bandeira L. Khan A. Cusano N.E. Hyperparathyroidism.Lancet. 2018; 391 (28923463): 168-17810.1016/S0140-6736(17)31430-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Prescott J.D. Udelsman R.

Semaphorins are highly conserved secreted membrane-bound glycoproteins originally identified as axon guidance molecules in the developing nervous system (23Pasterkamp R.J.

However, work in recent years has implicated them in a wide range of developmental, physiological, and pathological processes outside of the central nervous system, including tumor progression (24Neufeld G.

The primary receptors for semaphorins are plexins and neuropilins. Most membrane-bound semaphorins bind directly to plexins, whereas secreted class 3 semaphorins may require neuropilin as obligate plexin co-receptors (26Epstein J.A. Aghajanian H. Singh M.K.

Increasing evidence has shown that semaphorins also can signal through a nonplexin receptor complex (28Cagnoni G. Tamagnone L. Semaphorin receptors meet receptor tyrosine kinases on the way of tumor progression.Oncogene. 2014; 33 (24213581): 4795-480210.1038/onc.2013.474Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Aghajanian H.

Commun. 2016; 7 (27356767)1203810.1038/ncomms12038Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Sema3d is expressed in the proepicardial organs and Sema3d-expressing proepicardial cells give rise to coronary vascular endothelium. While studying epicardial function of Sema3d, we noticed that Sema3d was expressed in the third pharyngeal pouch, giving rise to the parathyroid gland. Here, we report that Sema3d is expressed in the developing parathyroid gland and required for its proper development. Genetic deletion of Sema3d leads to PHPT due to the enlarged parathyroid gland. Molecular and biochemical analyses suggest that Sema3d inhibits parathyroid cell proliferation by decreasing the EGFR/ErbB signaling pathway. We demonstrate that EGFR signaling is elevated in Sema3d−/− parathyroid glands, and pharmacological inhibition of EGFR signaling can partially rescue the parathyroid hyperplasia phenotype. Because EGFR/ErbB signaling pathway is activated in the parathyroid glands in both PHPT and SHPT, the Sema3d-EGFR/ErbB signaling axis may be targeted to treat parathyroid hyperplasia, especially in persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism after parathyroidectomy. To determine the expression of Sema3d during parathyroid development, we performed expression and lineage tracing analyses in Sema3dGFPCre/+ mice (30Degenhardt K. Singh M.K. Aghajanian H. Massera D. Wang Q. Li J. Li L. Choi C. Yzaguirre A.D. Francey L.J. Gallant E. Krantz I.D. Gruber P.J. Epstein J.A. Semaphorin 3d signaling defects are associated with anomalous pulmonary venous connections.Nat. Med. 2013; 19 (23685842): 760-76510.1038/nm.3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Bright field and direct GFP fluorescence in E9.5 Sema3dGFPCre/+ embryos demonstrated that Sema3d is expressed in the third pharyngeal pouch. Stronger GFP signals were observed in the dorso-anterior domain of the third pouch that represents the parathyroid domain (Fig. 1A). Similarly, when we crossed the Sema3dGFPCre/+ line with the R26RlacZ reporter line, strong β-gal activity was observed in the third pharyngeal pouch (Fig. 1B). Our results are consistent with a previous report suggesting that Sema3d is expressed in the parathyroid-specific domain of the common primordium that gives rise to the thymus and parathyroid (31Takahashi K. Ishida M. Hirokawa K. Takahashi H. Expression of the semaphorins Sema 3D and Sema 3F in the developing parathyroid and thymus.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237 (18489001): 1699-170810.1002/dvdy.21556Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus far, Sema3d−/− mice survive and have abnormal pulmonary vein patterning causing left-to-right shunt, as characterized by severely enlarged right atria and ventricle (30Degenhardt K. Singh M.K.

To demonstrate the functional requirement of Sema3d in parathyroid development, we performed histological and molecular analyses on the parathyroid gland in both control and Sema3d−/− mice. Morphological and histological examinations of the parathyroid glands from postnatal day 0 (P0), P6, and 12-month-old control and Sema3d−/− mice revealed a marked increase in size and hypercellularity, suggesting hyperplasia (Fig. 2, A and B and Fig. S1). Only one of the two parathyroid glands was hyperplastic, suggesting adenomatous transformation. Gross morphological and histological abnormalities resembling parathyroid hyperplasia were observed in 40% (19 of 46) of Sema3d−/− mice. Gcm2 immunohistochemistry was performed to mark the parathyroid glands in control and Sema3d−/− mice (Fig. 2C). Significant increase in the parathyroid area was observed in Sema3d−/− mice (Fig. 2D).Figure 2Primary hyperparathyroidism in Sema3d−/− mice.

We observed elevated PTH levels in Sema3d−/− mice compared with their littermate controls (Fig. 2E). In most cases of PHPT, increased serum PTH levels are associated with increased serum calcium levels. However, in some cases of normocalcemic PHPT, PTH levels are elevated but serum calcium levels remain normal (18Bandeira L. Bilezikian J. Primary hyperparathyroidism.F1000Res. 2016; 5 (F1000 Faculty Rev-1) (27508075)10.12688/f1000research.7039.1Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Cusano N.E. Silverberg S.J. Bilezikian J.P.

To determine whether elevated PTH levels in Sema3d−/− mice are associated with changes in calcium levels, we measured serum calcium levels in the same set of animals. We observed elevated calcium levels in Sema3d−/− mice compared with their littermate controls, suggesting PHPT (Fig. 2F). To determine the molecular changes associated with parathyroid hyperplasia, we isolated RNA from dissected parathyroid gland from control and Sema3d−/− mice and performed qPCR analysis for parathyroid-specific genes such as parathyroid hormone (PTH), glial cells missing homolog 2 (Gcm2), and calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Expression levels of PTH and Gcm2 were significantly elevated in Sema3d−/− parathyroid compared with controls. However, the expression of CaSR was not altered in Sema3d−/− parathyroid glands (Fig. 2G). To determine whether observed hyperplasia in Sema3d−/− mice is due to abnormal parathyroid cell proliferation, we performed Ki-67 immunostaining on P0 and 6-month-old parathyroid sections from control and Sema3d−/− mice. A dramatic increase in the number of Ki-667–positive cells was noted in the Sema3d−/− parathyroid sections compared with controls at both time points. This suggests that abnormal cell proliferation is the primary cause of parathyroid hyperplasia (Fig. 3A). To determine the molecular changes associated with increased parathyroid cell proliferation and hyperplasia in Sema3d−/− mice, we analyzed the expression of cell cycle regulators, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKIs) by qPCR on RNA isolated from microdissected parathyroid glands. We observed a 4-fold increase in the expression of Ccdn1 (cyclin D1), an oncogene known to be overexpressed in 20–40% of parathyroid adenomas (33Imanishi Y. Hosokawa Y. Yoshimoto K. Schipani E.

We also observed an increase in Cdkn2a (p21) and a modest decrease in Cdk4 expression in Sema3d−/− parathyroid (Fig. 3B). Increased expression of Cdkn2a has been associated with tumor progression (36Dong Y. Walsh M.D. McGuckin M.A. Gabrielli B.G. Cummings M.C. Wright R.G. Hurst T. Khoo S.K. Parsons P.G.

Growing evidence suggests that, depending on its environment, Cdkn2a can act as either tumor suppressor or an oncogene (37Abbas T.

No significant changes were observed in Ccdn2 (cyclin D2), Cdkn2c (p18), Cdkn1b (p27), and Cdkn1c (p57). To determine total RNA quality isolated from the microdissected parathyroid tissues, we performed qPCR analysis for thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), troponin T1 (Tnnt1), and Sox9. This allowed us to detect possible contamination from thyroid, skeletal muscle, and cartilage tissues, respectively. No significant changes were observed (Fig. S2). Together, these results suggest that Sema3d inhibits parathyroid cell proliferation in vivo by regulating the expression of cell cycle genes. Because parathyroid tissues from mice are limited, we used a human parathyroid cell line, sHPT-1, to dissect the molecular mechanism of Sema3d-mediated inhibition of parathyroid cell proliferation. sHPT-1 is established from a hyperplastic parathyroid gland surgically removed from an SHPT patient (39Björklund P.

To determine whether sHPT-1 cells are sufficiently similar to primary parathyroid cells with regard to their semaphorin signaling pathways, we treated sHPT-1 cells with recombinant Sema3d and analyzed proliferation by Ki-67 staining. Consistent with the in vivo data, we see significant reduction in sHPT-1 cell proliferation in Sema3d-treated samples compared with controls. This suggests that Sema3d inhibits parathyroid cell proliferation under both in vivo and in vitro conditions (Fig. 3C). Semaphorins signal through their classical Plexin and neuropilin receptors and other receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (28Cagnoni G. Tamagnone L.

https://openalex.org/W2938736019,"Integrins are transmembrane proteins involved in hemostasis, wound healing, immunity and cancer. In response to intracellular signals and ligand binding, integrins adopt different conformations: the bent (resting) form; the intermediate extended form; and the ligand-occupied active form. An integrin undergoing such conformational dynamics is the heterodimeric platelet receptor alphaIIbbeta3. Although the dramatic rearrangement of the overall structure of alphaIIbbeta3 during the activation process is potentially related to changes in the protein secondary structure, this has not been investigated so far in a membrane environment. Here we examine the Mn2+- and drug-induced activation of alphaIIbbeta3 and the impact on the structure of this protein reconstituted into liposomes. By quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring and activation assays we show that Mn2+ induces binding of the conformation-specific antibody PAC-1, which only recognizes the extended, active integrin. Circular dichroism spectroscopy reveals, however, that Mn2+-treatment does not induce major secondary structural changes of alphaIIbbeta3. Similarly, we found that treatment with clinically relevant drugs (e.g. quinine) led to the activation of alphaIIbbeta3 without significant changes in protein secondary structure. Molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed minor local changes in the beta-sheet probability of several extracellular domains of the integrin. Our experimental setup represents a new approach to study transmembrane proteins, especially integrins, in a membrane environment and opens a new way for testing drug binding to integrins under clinically relevant conditions."

Analyses were conducted on two sets of incisors from female and male specimens, that were intoxicated with cadmium (n = 12) or belonged to the control (n = 12). The cadmium group was administered with CdCl2 dissolved in drinking water with a dose of 4mg/kgbw for 10 weeks. The oral intake of cadmium by adult rats led to the range of structural changes in enamel morphology and its mechanical features. A significant increase of cadmium levels in the teeth in comparison to the control, a slight shift in the colour and reduction of pigmented enamel length, higher surface irregularity, a decrease of hydroxyapatite crystals size in the c-axis and simultaneous increase in pigmented enamel hardness were observed. The extent of these changes was sex-dependent and was more pronounced in males."
https://openalex.org/W2936582060,"Background This study aimed to investigate the distribution of European Union (EU) healthcare research grants across EU countries, and to study the effect of the potential influencing factors on grant allocation. Methods We analysed publicly available data on healthcare research grants from the 7th Framework Programme and the Horizon 2020 Programme allocated to beneficiaries between 2007 and 2016. Grant allocation was analysed at the beneficiary-, country-, and country group-level (EU-15 versus newer Member States, defined as EU-13). The investigated country-level explanatory variables included GDP per capita, population size, overall disease burden, and healthcare research excellence. Grant amounts per 100,000 inhabitants were used as an outcome variable in the regression analyses. Results Research funds were disproportionally allocated to EU-15 versus the EU-13, as 96.9% of total healthcare grants were assigned to EU-15 countries. At the beneficiary level, EU funding was positively influenced by participating in previous grants. The average grant amount per beneficiary was higher for EU-15 organizations. In the multiple regression analysis GDP per capita (p = 0.002) and research excellence (p<0.001) had a significant positive association with EU funding. Population size had an inverted U-shaped relationship with EU funding for healthcare research, having the largest per capita funding in second and the third quartiles (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02). Conclusion The uneven allocation of healthcare research funds across EU countries was influenced by GDP per capita, medical research excellence and population size. Wealthier countries with an average population size and strong research excellence in healthcare had more EU funding for healthcare research. Higher disease burden apparently was not associated with more EU research funding. While our findings are in line with analyses on previous periods, they suggest that the EU did not implement any effective policy measures to improve the unfair allocation of research grants."
https://openalex.org/W2937610527,"Background Ambulance services play a crucial role in providing pre-hospital emergency care. In order to ensure quick responses, the location of the bases, and the distribution of available ambulances among these bases, should be optimized. In mixed urban-rural areas, this optimization typically involves a trade-off between backup coverage in high-demand urban areas and single coverage in rural low-demand areas. The aim of this study was to find the optimal distribution of bases and ambulances in the Vestfold region of Norway in order to optimize ambulance coverage. Method The optimal location of bases and distribution of ambulances was estimated using the Maximum Expected Covering Location Model. A wide range of parameter settings were fitted, with the number of ambulances ranging from 1 to 15, and an average ambulance utilization of 0, 15, 35 and 50%, corresponding to the empirical numbers for night, afternoon and day, respectively. We performed the analysis both conditioned on the current base structure, and in a fully greenfield scenario. Results Four of the five current bases are located close to the mathematical optimum, with the exception of the northernmost base, in the rural part of the region. Moving this base, along with minor changes to the location of the four other bases, coverage can be increased from 93.46% to 97.51%. While the location of the bases is insensitive to the workload of the system, the distribution of the ambulances is not. The northernmost base should only be used if enough ambulances are available, and this required minimum number increases significantly with increasing system workload. Conclusion As the load of the system increases, focus of the model shifts from providing single coverage in low-demand areas to backup coverage in high-demand areas. The classification rule for urban and rural areas significantly affects results and must be evaluated accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W2937652115,"There is a global trend of increasing use in prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. This hasn't been verified in Canada. In addition, there are changes made to the collection method of medication information after the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) cycle 2. This study aims to review the potential impact of the changes in medication data collection and the trends in medication use if data quality remains similar throughout the CHMS cycles 1 to 4. This is fundamental for the analysis of this biomonitoring database.The CHMS cycle 1 to 4 medication and household data were used to study the trends of medication use between 2007 and 2015. The use of prescription or OTC drugs was grouped based on the first levels of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification system. The total numbers of medications were asked in all cycles. However, only a maximum of 15 and 5 drugs could be respectively reported for existing and new prescription or OTC drugs in cycles 1 and 2. There were no restrictions on drug reporting after cycle 2. The trends of medication use were described as ratios, compared to cycle 1.The total numbers of the types of medication ever identified decreased from 739 to 603 between cycles 1 and 4. The proportions of using any drugs were from 0.90 to 0.88 between cycles 1 and 4 (ratio = 1.08 in cycle 4, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.26). The numbers of drugs in use were from 3.9 to 3.8 (ratio = 1.05 in cycle 4, 95% CI = 0.86 to 1.24). The proportions of prescription drug use were from 0.53 to 0.55 (ratio = 1.13 in cycle 4, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.37), while the numbers of prescription were from 1.51 to 1.68 (ratio = 1.20 in cycle 4, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.48). The use of diabetes and thyroid medication had trends similar to the respective disease prevalence. The use and the numbers of drugs for blood and blood forming organs significantly increased between cycles 1 and 4 (ratio = 1.56 in cycle 4, 95% CI = 1.03 to 2.10).There is an increasing trend in the use of blood and blood forming agents through cycles 2 to 4 and cardiovascular drugs in cycle 3. For diabetes and thyroid medication, the proportions of medication use increase proportionally with disease prevalence. The changes in the medication information collection method may not have important impact on the reporting of the use of prescription or OTC drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2938283306,"This paper provides a general equilibrium approach to pricing volatility. Existing models (e.g., ARCH/GARCH, stochastic volatility) take a statistical approach to estimating volatility, volatility indices (e.g., CBOE VIX) use a weighted combination of options, and utility based models assume a specific type of preferences. In contrast we treat volatility as an asset and price it using the general equilibrium state pricing framework. Our results show that the general equilibrium volatility method developed in this paper provides superior forecasting ability for realized volatility and serves as an effective fear gauge. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of our approach by pricing downside risk and upside opportunity. Finally, we show that the superior forecasting ability of our approach generates significant economic value through volatility timing."

https://openalex.org/W2935875412,"The term heterotopy of the spiral colon encompasses a dysmorphological condition in which the spiral loops of the ascending colon (SLACs) do not form an orderly spiraling mass adjacent to the left side of the mesojejunum. As a consequence, the spiral loops are spread over a larger surface, making them more or less movable. It has been hypothesized that the abnormal position of the spiral loops of the ascending colon might constitute a predisposing factor for an intestinal obstruction or an ileus condition. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the anatomy of the spiral loops of the ascending colon in a population of healthy calves and to determine the prevalence of dysmorphism. The investigation was carried out on 1113 slaughtered veal calves. In 472 out of the 1113 calves, the spiral loops showed conformational aspects different from what has so far been described as normal in reference textbooks. In 91 calves the condition was definitely considered a pathological deviation from normality: in fact, the spiral colon had lost its typical spiral shape with random spacing between the loops, and it was nearly or completely detached from the mesojejunum. The lack of a broad attachment of the spiral loops of the ascending colon to the mesentery could provoke an alteration of the intestinal centre of gravity, enhancing the already asymmetrical distribution of weight between the jejunum and the descending colon."
https://openalex.org/W2937977331,"When talking about absence, we may express it in a negative statement (using explicit negation e.g. I was not) or in a positive statement (using implicit negation e.g. I wished I were). Previous research has shown that explicitly negated statements may cause false recall-negated items may paradoxically be remembered as present. The current study compares false recall caused by implicit and explicit negation. Participants listened to a recording in which some objects were mentioned as present, some as absent, and some not mentioned at all. The absence of objects was expressed using explicit or implicit negation. Participants' recall of the recording was measured either five minutes or one week after exposure to the recording. Results indicate that implicit and explicit negation lead to a nearly identical false recall of negated items. However, items not mentioned in the recording (i.e. neither mentioned nor negated) were more often recognized as present by participants exposed to implicit, rather than explicit negation. We postulate that false recall of negated items could be explained by participants remembering the item itself, but forgetting the context in which it was present (an affirmative or a negative statement), hence objects would be recalled as present just because they were spoken of."
